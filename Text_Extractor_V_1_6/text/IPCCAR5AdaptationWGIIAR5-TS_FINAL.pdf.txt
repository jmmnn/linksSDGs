ASSESSING AND MANAGING THE RISKS
OF CLIMATE CHANGE

Human interference with the climate system is occurring (WGI AR5 SPM
Section D.3; WGI AR5 Sections 2.2, 6.3, 10.3 to 10.6, 10.9). Climate
change poses risks for human and natural systems (Figure TS.1). The
assessment of impacts, adaptation, and vulnerability in the Working
Group II contribution to the IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report (WGII AR5)
evaluates how patterns of risks and potential benefits are shifting due
to climate change. It considers how impacts and risks related to climate
change can be reduced and managed through adaptation and mitigation.
The report assesses needs, options, opportunities, constraints, resilience,
limits, and other aspects associated with adaptation. It recognizes that
risks of climate change will vary across regions and populations, through
space and time, dependent on myriad factors including the extent of
adaptation and mitigation. 

Climate change involves complex interactions and changing likelihoods
of diverse impacts. A focus on risk, which is new in this report, supports
decision making in the context of climate change and complements
other elements of the report. People and societies may perceive or rank
risks and potential benefits differently, given diverse values and goals.

Compared to past WGII reports, the WGII AR5 assesses a substantially
larger knowledge base of relevant scientific, technical, and socioeconomic

literature. Increased literature has facilitated comprehensive assessment
across a broader set of topics and sectors, with expanded coverage of
human systems, adaptation, and the ocean. See Box TS.1. 

Section A of this summary characterizes observed impacts, vulnerability
and exposure, and adaptive responses to date. Section B examines future
risks and potential benefits across sectors and regions, highlighting where
choices matter for reducing risks through mitigation and adaptation.
Section C considers principles for effective adaptation and the broader
interactions among adaptation, mitigation, and sustainable development. 

Box TS.2 defines central concepts. To convey the degree of certainty in key
findings, the report relies on the consistent use of calibrated uncertainty
language, introduced in Box TS.3. Chapter references in brackets indicate
support for findings, figures, and tables in this summary.

Technical Summary

Box TS.1 | Context for the Assessment

For the past 2 decades, IPCC’s Working Group II has developed assessments of climate change impacts, adaptation, and vulnerability.
The WGII AR5 builds from the WGII contribution to the IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report (WGII AR4), published in 2007, and the
Special Report on Managing the Risks of Extreme Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaptation (SREX), published in
2012. It follows the Working Group I contribution to the AR5 (WGI AR5). The WGII AR5 is presented in two parts (Part A: Global and
Sectoral Aspects, and Part B: Regional Aspects), reﬂecting the expanded literature basis and multidisciplinary approach, increased
focus on societal impacts and responses, and continued regionally comprehensive coverage. [1.1 to 1.3]

TS

The number of scientiﬁc publications available for assessing climate change impacts, adaptation, and vulnerability more
than doubled between 2005 and 2010, with especially rapid increases in publications related to adaptation, allowing
for a more robust assessment that supports policymaking (high conﬁdence). The diversity of the topics and regions covered has
similarly expanded, as has the geographic distribution of authors contributing to the knowledge base for climate change assessments
(Box TS.1 Figure 1). Authorship of climate change publications from developing countries has increased, although it still represents a
small fraction of the total. The unequal distribution of publications presents a challenge to the production of a comprehensive and
balanced global assessment. [1.1, Figure 1-1]

Box TS.1 (continued)

Adaptation has emerged as a central area in climate change research, in country-level planning, and in implementation
of climate change strategies (high conﬁdence). The body of literature, including government and private sector reports, shows
an increased focus on adaptation opportunities and the interrelations between adaptation, mitigation, and alternative sustainable
pathways. The literature shows an emergence of studies on transformative processes that take advantage of synergies between
adaptation planning, development strategies, social protection, and disaster risk reduction and management. [1.1]

As a core feature and innovation of IPCC assessment, major ﬁndings are presented with deﬁned, calibrated language
that communicates the strength of scientiﬁc understanding, including uncertainties and areas of disagreement (Box
TS.3). Each ﬁnding is supported by a traceable account of the evaluation of evidence and agreement. [1.1, Box 1-1] 

TS

Box TS.2 | Terms Central for Understanding the Summary

Central concepts deﬁned in the WGII AR5 glossary and used throughout the report include the following terms. Reﬂecting progress in
science, some deﬁnitions differ in breadth and focus from the deﬁnitions used in the AR4 and other IPCC reports.

Climate change: Climate change refers to a change in the state of the climate that can be identiﬁed (e.g., by using statistical tests)
by changes in the mean and/or the variability of its properties, and that persists for an extended period, typically decades or longer.
Climate change may be due to natural internal processes or external forcings such as modulations of the solar cycles, volcanic
eruptions, and persistent anthropogenic changes in the composition of the atmosphere or in land use. Note that the Framework
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), in its Article 1, deﬁnes climate change as: “a change of climate which is attributed directly
or indirectly to human activity that alters the composition of the global atmosphere and which is in addition to natural climate
variability observed over comparable time periods.” The UNFCCC thus makes a distinction between climate change attributable to
human activities altering the atmospheric composition, and climate variability attributable to natural causes.

Hazard: The potential occurrence of a natural or human-induced physical event or trend or physical impact that may cause loss of
life, injury, or other health impacts, as well as damage and loss to property, infrastructure, livelihoods, service provision, ecosystems,
and environmental resources. In this report, the term hazard usually refers to climate-related physical events or trends or their physical
impacts.

Exposure: The presence of people, livelihoods, species or ecosystems, environmental functions, services, and resources, infrastructure,
or economic, social, or cultural assets in places and settings that could be adversely affected.

Vulnerability: The propensity or predisposition to be adversely affected. Vulnerability encompasses a variety of concepts including
sensitivity or susceptibility to harm and lack of capacity to cope and adapt.

Impacts: Effects on natural and human systems. In this report, the term impacts is used primarily to refer to the effects on natural
and human systems of extreme weather and climate events and of climate change. Impacts generally refer to effects on lives,
livelihoods, health, ecosystems, economies, societies, cultures, services, and infrastructure due to the interaction of climate changes or
hazardous climate events occurring within a speciﬁc time period and the vulnerability of an exposed society or system. Impacts are
also referred to as consequences and outcomes. The impacts of climate change on geophysical systems, including ﬂoods, droughts,
and sea level rise, are a subset of impacts called physical impacts.

Technical Summary

Box TS.2 (continued)

Risk: The potential for consequences where something of value is at stake and where the outcome is uncertain, recognizing the
diversity of values. Risk is often represented as probability of occurrence of hazardous events or trends multiplied by the impacts if
these events or trends occur. Risk results from the interaction of vulnerability, exposure, and hazard (see Figure TS.1). In this report,
the term risk is used primarily to refer to the risks of climate-change impacts.

Adaptation: The process of adjustment to actual or expected climate and its effects. In human systems, adaptation seeks to moderate
or avoid harm or exploit beneﬁcial opportunities. In some natural systems, human intervention may facilitate adjustment to expected
climate and its effects.

TS

Incremental adaptation: Adaptation actions where the central aim is to maintain the essence and integrity of a system or
process at a given scale.

Transformational adaptation: Adaptation that changes the fundamental attributes of a system in response to climate and
its effects.

Transformation: A change in the fundamental attributes of natural and human systems. 

Resilience: The capacity of social, economic, and environmental systems to cope with a hazardous event or trend or disturbance,
responding or reorganizing in ways that maintain their essential function, identity, and structure, while also maintaining the capacity
for adaptation, learning, and transformation.

exposure, evaluating the sensitivity of systems to climate change. The
section also identifies challenges and options based on adaptation
experience, looking at what has motivated previous adaptation actions
in the context of climate change and broader objectives. It examines
current  understanding  of  decision  making  as  relevant  to  climate
change. 

A-1. Observed Impacts, Vulnerability, and Exposure

In recent decades, changes in climate have caused impacts on
natural and human systems on all continents and across the
oceans.  This  conclusion  is  strengthened  by  more  numerous  and
improved observations and analyses since the AR4. Evidence of climate-
change  impacts  is  strongest  and  most  comprehensive  for  natural
systems. Some impacts on human systems have also been attributed to
climate change, with a major or minor contribution of climate change
distinguishable  from  other  influences  such  as  changing  social  and
economic factors. In many regions, impacts on natural and human
systems are now detected even in the presence of strong confounding
factors  such  as  pollution  or  land  use  change.  See  Figure TS.2  and
Table TS.1 for a summary of observed impacts, illustrating broader
trends presented in this section. Attribution of observed impacts in the
WGII AR5 generally links responses of natural and human systems to
observed  climate  change,  regardless  of  its  cause.  Most  reported
impacts of climate change are attributed to warming and/or to shifts in

precipitation patterns. There is also emerging evidence of impacts of
ocean acidification. Relatively few robust attribution studies and meta-
analyses have linked impacts in physical and biological systems to
anthropogenic climate change. [18.1, 18.3 to 18.6]

Differences in vulnerability and exposure arise from non-climatic
factors and from multidimensional inequalities often produced
by uneven development processes (very high confidence). These
differences shape differential risks from climate change.  See
Figure TS.1 and Box TS.4. Vulnerability and exposure vary over time and
across  geographic  contexts.  Changes  in  poverty  or  socioeconomic
status, ethnic composition, age structure, and governance have had a
significant influence on the outcome of past crises associated with
climate-related hazards. [8.2, 9.3, 12.2, 13.1, 13.2, 14.1 to 14.3, 19.2,
19.6, 26.8, Box CC-GC]

Impacts  from  recent  climate-related  extremes,  such  as  heat
waves, droughts, floods, cyclones, and wildfires, reveal significant
vulnerability and exposure of some ecosystems and many human
systems to current climate variability (very high confidence).
Impacts of such climate-related extremes include alteration of ecosystems,
disruption of food production and water supply, damage to infrastructure
and settlements, morbidity and mortality, and consequences for mental
health and human well-being. For countries at all levels of development,
these impacts are consistent with a significant lack of preparedness
for current climate variability in some sectors. The following examples

Box TS.3 | Communication of the Degree of Certainty in Assessment Findings

Based on the Guidance Note for Lead Authors of the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report on Consistent Treatment of Uncertainties, the
WGII AR5 relies on two metrics for communicating the degree of certainty in key ﬁndings:
•

Conﬁdence in the validity of a ﬁnding, based on the type, amount, quality, and consistency of evidence (e.g., data, mechanistic
understanding, theory, models, expert judgment) and the degree of agreement. Conﬁdence is expressed qualitatively.
Quantiﬁed measures of uncertainty in a ﬁnding expressed probabilistically (based on statistical analysis of observations or
model results, or both, and expert judgment).

•

Each ﬁnding has its foundation in evaluation of associated
evidence and agreement. The summary terms to describe
evidence are: limited, medium, or robust; and agreement:
low, medium, or high. These terms are presented with some
key ﬁndings. In many cases, assessment authors in addition
evaluate their conﬁdence about the validity of a ﬁnding,
providing a synthesis of the evaluation of evidence and
agreement. Levels of conﬁdence include ﬁve qualiﬁers:
very low, low, medium, high, and very high. Box TS.3 Figure 1
illustrates the ﬂexible relationship between the summary
terms for evidence and agreement and the conﬁdence metric.
For a given evidence and agreement statement, different
conﬁdence levels could be assigned, but increasing levels of
evidence and degrees of agreement are correlated with increasing conﬁdence.

conﬁdence. The shading increasing toward the top right corner indicates increasing

independent lines of high-quality evidence. [Figure 1-3]

When assessment authors evaluate the likelihood, or probability, of some well-deﬁned outcome having occurred or occurring in the future,
a ﬁnding can include likelihood terms (see below) or a more precise presentation of probability. Use of likelihood is not an alternative
to use of conﬁdence. Unless otherwise indicated, ﬁndings assigned a likelihood term are associated with high or very high conﬁdence.

Exceptionally unlikely                               0–1% probability

Where appropriate, ﬁndings are also formulated as statements of fact without using uncertainty qualiﬁers.

Within paragraphs of this summary, the conﬁdence, evidence, and agreement terms given for a key ﬁnding apply to subsequent
statements in the paragraph, unless additional terms are provided.

Technical Summary

illustrate impacts of extreme weather and climate events experienced
across regional contexts:
•

In Africa, extreme weather and climate events including droughts
and floods have significant impacts on economic sectors, natural
resources, ecosystems, livelihoods, and human health. The floods of
the Zambezi River in Mozambique in 2008, for example, displaced
90,000  people,  and  along  the  Zambezi  River  Valley,  with
approximately 1 million people living in the flood-affected areas,
temporary displacement is taking on permanent characteristics.
[22.3, 22.4, 22.6]
Recent floods in Australia and New Zealand caused severe damage
to infrastructure and settlements and 35 deaths in Queensland
alone (2011). The Victorian heat wave (2009) increased heat-related
morbidity and was associated with more than 300 excess deaths,
while intense bushfires destroyed more than 2000 buildings and
led  to  173  deaths. Widespread  drought  in  southeast Australia
(1997–2009)  and  many  parts  of  New  Zealand  (2007–2009;
2012–2013) resulted in economic losses (e.g., regional GDP in the
southern  Murray-Darling  Basin  was  below  forecast  by  about
5.7% in 2007–2008, and New Zealand lost about NZ$3.6 billion in

25-1, Boxes 25-5, 25-6, and 25-8]
In Europe, extreme weather events currently have significant impacts
in multiple economic sectors as well as adverse social and health
effects (high confidence). [Table 23-1]
In North America, most economic sectors and human systems have
been affected by and have responded to extreme weather, including
hurricanes, flooding, and intense rainfall (high confidence). Extreme
heat events currently result in increases in mortality and morbidity
(very high confidence), with impacts that vary by age, location, and
socioeconomic factors (high confidence). Extreme coastal storm
events have caused excess mortality and morbidity, particularly
along the east coast of the United States, and the gulf coast of both
Mexico and the United States. Much North American infrastructure

Figure TS.2 | Widespread impacts in a changing world. (A) Global patterns of impacts in recent decades attributed to climate change, based on studies since the AR4. Impacts 
are shown at a range of geographic scales. Symbols indicate categories of attributed impacts, the relative contribution of climate change (major or minor) to the observed impact, 
and conﬁdence in attribution. See Table TS.1 for descriptions of the impacts. (B) Changes in glacier mass from all published measurements for Himalayan glaciers. Negative values 
indicate loss of glacier mass. Local measurements are mostly for small, accessible Himalayan glaciers. The blue box for each local Himalaya measurement is centered vertically on 
its average, and has a height of ±1 standard deviation for annual measurements and a height of ±1 standard error for multiannual measurements. Himalaya-wide measurement 
(red) was made by satellite laser altimetry. For reference, global average glacier mass change estimates from WGI AR5 4.3 are also shown, with shading indicating ±1 standard 
deviation. (C) Locations of substantial drought- and heat-induced tree mortality around the globe over 1970–2011. (D) Average rates of change in distribution (km per decade) 
for marine taxonomic groups based on observations over 1900–2010. Positive distribution changes are consistent with warming (moving into previously cooler waters, generally 
poleward). The number of responses analyzed is given within parentheses for each category. (E) Summary of estimated impacts of observed climate changes on yields over 
1960–2013 for four major crops in temperate and tropical regions, with the number of data points analyzed given within parentheses for each category. [Figures 3-3, 4-7, 7-2,

Technical Summary

Freshwater Resources

Terrestrial and Freshwater Ecosystems

In many regions, changing precipitation or melting snow and ice
are altering hydrological systems, affecting water resources in
terms  of  quantity  and  quality  (medium  confidence).  Glaciers
continue  to  shrink  almost  worldwide  due  to  climate  change  (high
confidence) (e.g., Figure TS.2B), affecting runoff and water resources
downstream (medium confidence). Climate change is causing permafrost
warming and thawing in high-latitude regions and in high-elevation
regions (high confidence). There is no evidence that surface water and
groundwater drought frequency has changed over the last few decades,
although impacts of drought have increased mostly due to increased
water demand. [3.2, 4.3, 18.3, 18.5, 24.4, 25.5, 26.2, 28.2, Tables 3-1
and 25-1, Figures 18-2 and 26-1] 

Many terrestrial and freshwater plant and animal species have
shifted  their  geographic  ranges  and  seasonal  activities  and
altered their abundance in response to observed climate change
over recent decades, and they are doing so now in many regions
(high confidence). Increased tree mortality, observed in many places
worldwide, has been attributed to climate change in some regions
(Figure TS.2C). Increases in the frequency or intensity of ecosystem
disturbances such as droughts, wind storms, fires, and pest outbreaks
have been detected in many parts of the world and in some cases are
attributed to climate change (medium confidence). While recent climate
change contributed to the extinction of some species of Central American
amphibians  (medium  confidence),  most  recent  observed  terrestrial

and ocean temperature and to ocean acidification (very high
confidence).  Coral  bleaching  and  species  range  shifts  have  been
attributed to changes in ocean temperature. For many other coastal
changes, the impacts of climate change are difficult to identify given
other human-related drivers (e.g. land use change, coastal development,
pollution) (robust evidence, high agreement). [5.3 to 5.5, 18.3, 25.6,
26.4, Box 25-3]

Marine Systems

Warming has caused and will continue to cause shifts in the
abundance,  geographic  distribution,  migration  patterns,  and
timing  of  seasonal  activities  of  marine  species  (very  high
confidence),  paralleled  by  reduction  in  maximum  body  sizes
(medium confidence). This has resulted and will further result in
changing interactions between species, including competition and
predator-prey dynamics (high confidence). Numerous observations
over the last decades in all ocean basins show global-scale changes
including large-scale distribution shifts of species (very high confidence)
and altered ecosystem composition (high confidence) on multi-decadal
time scales, tracking climate trends. Many fishes, invertebrates, and
phytoplankton  have  shifted  their  distribution  and/or  abundance
poleward and/or to deeper, cooler waters (Figure TS.2D). Some warm-
water corals and their reefs have responded to warming with species
replacement, bleaching, and decreased coral cover causing habitat
loss. Few field observations to date demonstrate biological responses
attributable to anthropogenic ocean acidification, as in many places
these responses are not yet outside their natural variability and may be
influenced by confounding local or regional factors. See also Box TS.7.
Natural global climate change at rates slower than current anthropogenic
climate change caused significant ecosystem shifts, including species
emergences and extinctions, during the past millions of years. [5.4, 6.1,
6.3 to 6.5, 18.3, 18.5, 22.3, 25.6, 26.4, 30.4, 30.5, Boxes 25-3, CC-OA,
CC-CR, and CC-MB]

Vulnerability of most marine organisms to warming is set by
their physiology, which defines their limited temperature ranges
and hence their thermal sensitivity (high confidence). See Figure
TS.3. Temperature defines the geographic distribution of many species
and their responses to climate change. Shifting temperature means and
extremes alter habitat (e.g., sea ice and coastal habitat), and cause
changes in species abundances through local extinctions and latitudinal
distribution expansions or shifts of up to hundreds of kilometers per
decade (very high confidence). Although genetic adaptation occurs
(medium confidence), the capacity of fauna and flora to compensate
for or keep up with the rate of ongoing thermal change is limited (low
confidence). [6.3, 6.5, 30.5]

Oxygen  minimum  zones  are  progressively  expanding  in  the
tropical  Pacific, Atlantic,  and  Indian  Oceans,  due  to  reduced
ventilation and O2 solubilities in more stratified oceans at higher
temperatures (high confidence). In combination with human activities
that increase the productivity of coastal systems, hypoxic areas (“dead
zones”) are increasing in number and size. Regional exacerbation of
hypoxia causes shifts to hypoxia-tolerant biota and reduces habitat for
commercially relevant species, with implications for fisheries. [6.1, 6.3,
30.3, 30.5, 30.6; WGI AR5 3.8]

Food Security and Food Production Systems

Based on many studies covering a wide range of regions and
crops, negative impacts of climate change on crop yields have
been more common than positive impacts (high confidence). The
smaller number of studies showing positive impacts relate mainly to
high-latitude regions, though it is not yet clear whether the balance of
impacts has been negative or positive in these regions. Climate change
has negatively affected wheat and maize yields for many regions and in
the global aggregate (medium confidence). Effects on rice and soybean
yield have been smaller in major production regions and globally, with
a median change of zero across all available data, which are fewer for
soy  compared  to  the  other  crops.  Observed  impacts  relate  mainly
to  production  aspects  of  food  security  rather  than  access  or  other
components  of  food  security.  See  Figure TS.2E.  Since AR4,  several
periods  of  rapid  food  and  cereal  price  increases  following  climate
extremes  in  key  producing  regions  indicate  a  sensitivity  of  current
markets to climate extremes among other factors (medium confidence).
Crop  yields  have  a  large  negative  sensitivity  to  extreme  daytime
temperatures  around  30°C,  throughout  the  growing  season  (high
confidence). CO2 has stimulatory effects on crop yields in most cases,
and elevated tropospheric ozone has damaging effects. Interactions
among CO2 and ozone, mean temperature, extremes, water, and nitrogen
are non-linear and difficult to predict (medium confidence). [7.2, 7.3,
18.4, 22.3, 26.5, Figures 7-2, 7-3, and 7-7, Box 25-3]

Urban Areas

Urban areas hold more than half the world’s population and
most of its built assets and economic activities. A high proportion
of the population and economic activities at risk from climate change
are in urban areas, and a high proportion of global greenhouse gas
emissions are generated by urban-based activities and residents. Cities
are composed of complex inter-dependent systems that can be leveraged
to support climate change adaptation via effective city governments
supported by cooperative multilevel governance (medium confidence). This
can enable synergies with infrastructure investment and maintenance,
land  use  management,  livelihood  creation,  and  ecosystem  services
protection. [8.1, 8.3, 8.4]

Rapid  urbanization  and  growth  of  large  cities  in  developing
countries  have  been  accompanied  by  expansion  of  highly
vulnerable urban communities living in informal settlements,
many of which are on land exposed to extreme weather (medium
confidence). [8.2, 8.3]

Figure TS.3 | Temperature specialization of species (A), which is inﬂuenced by other factors such as oxygen, causes warming-induced distribution shifts (B), for example, the 
northward expansion of warm-temperate species in the northeast Atlantic (C). These distribution changes depend on species-speciﬁc physiology and ecology. Detailed 
introduction of each panel follows: (A) The temperature tolerance range and performance levels of an organism are described by its performance curve. Each performance (e.g., 
exercise, growth, reproduction) is highest at optimum temperature (Topt) and lower at cooler or warmer temperatures. Surpassing temperature thresholds (Tp) means going into 
time-limited tolerance, and more extreme temperature changes lead to exceedance of thresholds that cause metabolic disturbances (Tc) and ultimately onset of cell damage (Td). 
These thresholds for an individual can shift (horizontal arrows), within limits, between summer and winter (seasonal acclimatization) or when the species adapts to a cooler or 
warmer climate over generations (evolutionary adaptation). Under elevated CO2 levels (ocean acidiﬁcation) or low oxygen, thermal windows narrow (dashed gray curves). (B) 
During climate warming, a species follows its normal temperatures as it moves or is displaced, typically resulting in a poleward shift of the biogeographic range (exempliﬁed for 
the Northern Hemisphere). The polygon delineates the distribution range in space and seasonal time; the level of gray denotes abundance. (C) Long-term changes in the mean 
number of warm-temperate pseudo-oceanic copepod species in the northeast Atlantic from 1958 to 2005. [Figures 6-5, 6-7, and 6-8]

Rural Areas

Climate change in rural areas will take place in the context of
many important economic, social, and land use trends (very high
confidence). In  different  regions,  absolute  rural  populations  have
peaked or will peak in the next few decades. The proportion of the rural

population  depending  on  agriculture  is  varied  across  regions,  but
declining everywhere. Poverty rates in rural areas are higher than overall
poverty rates, but also falling more sharply, and the proportions of
population in extreme poverty accounted for by rural people are also
falling: in both cases with the exception of sub-Saharan Africa, where
these rates are rising. Accelerating globalization, through migration,

labor linkages, regional and international trade, and new information
and  communication  technologies,  is  bringing  about  economic
transformation in rural areas of developing and developed countries.
[9.3, Figure 9-2]

For rural households and communities, access to land and natural
resources, flexible local institutions, knowledge and information,
and livelihood strategies can contribute to resilience to climate
change (high confidence). Especially in developing countries,
rural  people  are  subject  to  multiple  non-climatic  stressors,
including underinvestment in agriculture, problems with land
and natural resource policy, and processes of environmental
degradation (very high confidence). In developed countries, there
are important shifts toward multiple uses of rural areas, especially
leisure  uses,  and  new  rural  policies  based  on  the  collaboration  of
multiple stakeholders, the targeting of multiple sectors, and a change
from subsidy-based to investment-based policy. [9.3, 22.4, Table 9-3]

Key Economic Sectors and Services

Economic losses due to extreme weather events have increased
globally, mostly due to increase in wealth and exposure, with a
possible influence of climate change (low confidence in attribution
to climate change). Flooding can have major economic costs, both in
term of impacts (e.g., capital destruction, disruption) and adaptation (e.g.,
construction, defensive investment) (robust evidence, high agreement).
Since the mid-20th century, socioeconomic losses from flooding have
increased  mainly  due  to  greater  exposure  and  vulnerability  (high
confidence). [3.2, 3.4, 10.3, 18.4, 23.2, 23.3, 26.7, Figure 26-2, Box
25-7] 

Human Health

At present the worldwide burden of human ill-health from climate
change is relatively small compared with effects of other stressors
and is not well quantified. However, there has been increased heat-
related mortality and decreased cold-related mortality in some regions as
a result of warming (medium confidence). Local changes in temperature
and rainfall have altered the distribution of some waterborne illnesses
and disease vectors (medium confidence). [11.4 to 11.6, 18.4, 25.8]

The  health  of  human  populations  is  sensitive  to  shifts  in
weather patterns and other aspects of climate change (very high
confidence). These effects occur directly, due to changes in temperature
and precipitation and in the occurrence of heat waves, floods, droughts,
and fires. Health may be damaged indirectly by climate change-related
ecological disruptions, such as crop failures or shifting patterns of disease
vectors, or by social responses to climate change, such as displacement
of populations following prolonged drought. Variability in temperatures
is a risk factor in its own right, over and above the influence of average
temperatures on heat-related deaths. [11.4, 28.2]

Human Security

Challenges for vulnerability reduction and adaptation actions
are particularly high in regions that have shown severe difficulties
in  governance  (high  confidence).  Violent  conflict  increases
vulnerability to climate change (medium evidence, high agreement).
Large-scale violent conflict harms assets that facilitate adaptation,
including infrastructure, institutions, natural resources, social capital,
and livelihood opportunities. [12.5, 19.2, 19.6]

Technical Summary

Box TS.4 | Multidimensional Inequality and Vulnerability to Climate Change

People who are socially, economically, culturally, politically, institutionally, or otherwise marginalized in society are especially vulnerable
to climate change and also to some adaptation and mitigation responses (medium evidence, high agreement). This heightened
vulnerability is rarely due to a single cause. Rather, it is the product of intersecting social processes that result in inequalities in
socioeconomic status and income, as well as in exposure. Such social processes include, for example, discrimination on the basis of
gender, class, race/ethnicity, age, and (dis)ability. See Box TS.4 Figure 1 on previous page. Understanding differential capacities and
opportunities of individuals, households, and communities requires knowledge of these intersecting social drivers, which may be
context-speciﬁc and clustered in diverse ways (e.g., class and ethnicity in one case, gender and age in another). Few studies depict
the full spectrum of these intersecting social processes and the ways in which they shape multidimensional vulnerability to climate
change.

Examples of inequality-driven impacts and risks of climate change and climate change responses (medium evidence, high agreement):
Privileged members of society can beneﬁt from climate change impacts and response strategies, given their ﬂexibility in mobilizing
•
and accessing resources and positions of power, often to the detriment of others. [13.2, 13.3, 22.4, 26.8]
Differential impacts on men and women arise from distinct roles in society, the way these roles are enhanced or constrained by
other dimensions of inequality, risk perceptions, and the nature of response to hazards. [8.2, 9.3, 11.3, 12.2, 13.2, 18.4, 19.6,
22.4, Box CC-GC]
Both male and female deaths are recorded after ﬂooding, affected by socioeconomic disadvantage, occupation, and culturally
imposed expectations to save lives. Although women are generally more sensitive to heat stress, more male workers are reported
to have died largely as a result of responsibilities related to outdoor and indoor work. [11.3, 13.2, Box CC-GC]

•

• Women often experience additional duties as laborers and caregivers as a result of extreme weather events and climate change,

as well as responses (e.g., male outmigration), while facing more psychological and emotional distress, reduced food intake,
adverse mental health outcomes due to displacement, and in some cases increasing incidences of domestic violence. [9.3, 9.4,
12.4, 13.2, Box CC-GC]
Children and the elderly are often at higher risk due to narrow mobility, susceptibility to infectious diseases, reduced caloric
intake, and social isolation. While adults and older children are more severely affected by some climate-sensitive vector-borne
diseases such as dengue, young children are more likely to die from or be severely compromised by diarrheal diseases and
ﬂoods. The elderly face disproportional physical harm and death from heat stress, droughts, and wildﬁres. [8.2, 10.9, 11.1, 11.4,
11.5, 13.2, 22.4, 23.5, 26.6]
In most urban areas, low-income groups, including migrants, face large climate change risks because of poor-quality, insecure,
and clustered housing, inadequate infrastructure, and lack of provision for health care, emergency services, ﬂood exposure, and
measures for disaster risk reduction. [8.1, 8.2, 8.4, 8.5, 12.4, 22.3, 26.8]
People disadvantaged by race or ethnicity, especially in developed countries, experience more harm from heat stress, often due
to low economic status and poor health conditions, and displacement after extreme events. [11.3, 12.4, 13.2]
Livelihoods and lifestyles of indigenous peoples, pastoralists, and ﬁsherfolk, often dependent on natural resources, are highly
sensitive to climate change and climate change policies, especially those that marginalize their knowledge, values, and activities.
[9.3, 11.3, 12.3, 14.2, 22.4, 25.8, 26.8, 28.2]
Disadvantaged groups without access to land and labor, including female-headed households, tend to beneﬁt less from climate
change response mechanisms (e.g., Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), Reduction of Emissions from Deforestation and
Forest Degradation (REDD+), large-scale land acquisition for biofuels, and planned agricultural adaptation projects). [9.3, 12.2,

Livelihoods and Poverty

Climate-related hazards exacerbate other stressors, often with
negative outcomes for livelihoods, especially for people living
in poverty (high confidence). Climate-related hazards affect poor
people’s lives directly through impacts on livelihoods, reductions in crop
yields, or destruction of homes and indirectly through, for example,
increased food prices and food insecurity. Urban and rural transient
poor who face multiple deprivations can slide into chronic poverty as a
result of extreme events, or a series of events, when unable to rebuild
their  eroded  assets  (limited  evidence,  high  agreement).  Observed
positive effects for poor and marginalized people, which are limited and
often  indirect,  include  examples  such  as  diversification  of  social
networks and of agricultural practices. [8.2, 8.3, 9.3, 11.3, 13.1 to 13.3,
22.3, 24.4, 26.8]

Livelihoods of indigenous peoples in the Arctic have been altered
by  climate  change,  through  impacts  on  food  security  and
traditional  and  cultural  values  (medium  confidence).  There  is
emerging  evidence  of  climate  change  impacts  on  livelihoods  of
indigenous people in other regions. [18.4, Table 18-9, Box 18-5]

A-2. Adaptation Experience

Throughout history, people and societies have adjusted to and coped
with climate, climate variability, and extremes, with varying degrees of
success. This section focuses on adaptive human responses to observed
and projected climate-change impacts, which can also address broader
risk-reduction and development objectives.

Adaptation is becoming embedded in some planning processes,
with more limited implementation of responses (high confidence).
Engineered  and  technological  options  are  commonly  implemented
adaptive responses, often integrated within existing programs such as
disaster risk management and water management. There is increasing
recognition of the value of social, institutional, and ecosystem-based
measures and of the extent of constraints to adaptation. Adaptation
options adopted to date continue to emphasize incremental adjustments
and co-benefits and are starting to emphasize flexibility and learning
(medium evidence, medium agreement). [4.4, 5.5, 6.4, 8.3, 9.4, 11.7,
14.1, 14.3, 15.2 to 15.5, 17.2, 17.3, 22.4, 23.7, 25.4, 25.10, 26.8, 26.9,
27.3, 30.6, Boxes 25-1, 25-2, 25-9, and CC-EA]

Most assessments of adaptation have been restricted to impacts,
vulnerability, and adaptation planning, with very few assessing the
processes of implementation or the effects of adaptation actions
(medium evidence, high agreement). Vulnerability indicators define,
quantify, and weight aspects of vulnerability across regional units, but
methods of constructing indices are subjective, often lack transparency,
and can be difficult to interpret. There are conflicting views on the
choice of adaptation metrics, given differing values placed on needs
and outcomes, many of which cannot be captured in a comparable way
by metrics. Indicators proving most useful for policy learning are those
that track not just process and implementation, but also the extent to
which  targeted  outcomes  are  occurring.  Multi-metric  evaluations
including risk and uncertainty are increasingly used, an evolution from

a previous focus on cost-benefit analysis and identification of “best
economic adaptations” (high confidence). Adaptation assessments best
suited to delivering effective adaptation measures often include both
top-down assessments of biophysical climate changes and bottom-up
assessments of vulnerability targeted toward local solutions to globally
derived risks and toward particular decisions. [4.4, 14.4, 14.5, 15.2, 15.3,
17.2, 17.3, 21.3, 21.5, 22.4, 25.4, 25.10, 26.8, 26.9, Box CC-EA] 

•

Adaptation experience is accumulating across regions in the public
and private sector and within communities (high confidence).
Governments at various levels are starting to develop adaptation
plans and policies and to integrate climate-change considerations
into broader development plans. Examples of adaptation across
regions and contexts include the following:
• Urban  adaptation  has  emphasized  city-based  disaster  risk
management such as early warning systems and infrastructure
investments; ecosystem-based adaptation and green roofs; enhanced
storm and wastewater management; urban and peri-urban agriculture
improving food security; enhanced social protection; and good-
quality, affordable, and well-located housing (high confidence). [8.3,
8.4, 15.4, 26.8, Boxes 25-9, CC-UR, and CC-EA]
There is a growing body of literature on adaptation practices in
both  developed  and  developing  country  rural  areas,  including
documentation of practical experience in agriculture, water, forestry,
and biodiversity and, to a lesser extent, fisheries (very high confidence).
Public policies supporting decision making for adaptation in rural
areas exist in developed and, increasingly, developing countries, and
there are also examples of private adaptations led by individuals,
companies,  and  nongovernmental  organizations  (NGOs)  (high
confidence). Adaptation  constraints,  particularly  pronounced  in
developing countries, result from lack of access to credit, land,
water, technology, markets, information, and perceptions of the
need to change. [9.4, 17.3, Tables 9-7 and 9-8] 
In Africa, most national governments are initiating governance
systems for adaptation (high confidence). Progress on national and
subnational policies and strategies has initiated the mainstreaming
of  adaptation  into  sectoral  planning,  but  evolving  institutional
frameworks cannot yet effectively coordinate the range of adaptation
initiatives being implemented. Disaster risk management, adjustments
in technologies and infrastructure, ecosystem-based approaches,
basic public health measures, and livelihood diversification are
reducing vulnerability, although efforts to date tend to be isolated.
[22.4]
In Europe, adaptation policy has been developed at international
(EU), national, and local government levels, with limited systematic
information  on  current  implementation  or  effectiveness  (high
confidence). Some adaptation planning has been integrated into
coastal and water management, into environmental protection and
land planning, and into disaster risk management. [23.7, Boxes 5-1
and 23-3]
In Asia,  adaptation  is  being  facilitated  in  some  areas  through
mainstreaming  climate  adaptation  action 
into  subnational
development planning, early warning systems, integrated water
resources management, agroforestry, and coastal reforestation of
mangroves (high confidence). [24.4 to 24.6, 24.9, Box CC-TC]
In Australasia, planning for sea level rise, and in southern Australia
for reduced water availability, is becoming adopted widely. Planning

Technical Summary

Table TS.2 |  Illustrative examples of adaptation experience, as well as approaches to reducing vulnerability and enhancing resilience. Adaptation actions can be inﬂ uenced by 
climate variability, extremes, and change, and by exposure and vulnerability at the scale of risk management. Many examples and case studies demonstrate complexity at the 
level of communities or speciﬁ c regions within a country. It is at this spatial scale that complex interactions between vulnerability, exposure, and climate change come to the fore.

Exposure and vulnerability

Factors affecting exposure and vulnerability include age, preexisting health status, level of outdoor activity, socioeconomic factors including poverty and social

[8.2.3, 8.2.4, 11.3.3, 11.3.4, 11.4.1, 11.7, 13.2.1, 19.3.2, 23.5.1, 25.3, 25.8.1, SREX Table SPM.1]

Climate information at the

Observed: 
• Very likely decrease in the number of cold days and nights and increase in the number of warm days and nights, on the global scale between 1951 and 

2010. [WGI AR5 2.6.1]

• Medium conﬁ dence that the length and frequency of warm spells, including heat waves, has increased globally since 1950. [WGI AR5 2.6.1]

Projected: Virtually certain that, in most places, there will be more hot and fewer cold temperature extremes as global mean temperatures increase, for 
events deﬁ ned as extremes on both daily and seasonal time scales. [WGI AR5 12.4.3]

Climate information at the 
regional scale

Observed: 
• Likely that heat wave frequency has increased since 1950 in large parts of Europe, Asia, and Australia. [WGI AR5 2.6.1]
• Medium conﬁ dence in overall increase in heat waves and warm spells in North America since 1960. Insufﬁ cient evidence for assessment or spatially varying 

trends in heat waves or warm spells for South America and most of Africa. [SREX Table 3-2; WGI AR5 2.6.1]

Description

Broader context

Projected:
• Likely that, by the end of the 21st century under Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5) in most land regions, a current 20-year high-

temperature event will at least double its frequency and in many regions occur every 2 years or annually, while a current 20-year low-temperature event 
will become exceedingly rare. [WGI AR5 12.4.3]

• Very likely more frequent and/or longer heat waves or warm spells over most land areas. [WGI AR5 12.4.3]

Heat-health early warning systems are instruments to prevent negative health impacts during heat waves. Weather forecasts are used to predict situations 
associated with increased mortality or morbidity. Components of effective heat wave and health warning systems include identifying weather situations 
that adversely affect human health, monitoring weather forecasts, communicating heat wave and prevention responses, targeting notiﬁ cations to vulnerable 
populations, and evaluating and revising the system to increase effectiveness in a changing climate. Warning systems for heat waves have been planned and 
implemented broadly, for example in Europe, the United States, Asia, and Australia.
[11.7.3, 24.4.6, 25.8.1, 26.6, Box 25-6]

• Heat-health warning systems can be combined with other elements of a health protection plan, for example building capacity to support communities most 

at risk, supporting and funding health services, and distributing public health information. 

• In Africa, Asia, and elsewhere, early warning systems have been used to provide warning of and reduce a variety of risks related to famine and food 

insecurity; ﬂ ooding and other weather-related hazards; exposure to air pollution from ﬁ re; and vector-borne and food-borne disease outbreaks.

Loss of mangroves increases exposure of coastlines to storm surge, coastal erosion, saline intrusion, and tropical cyclones. Exposed infrastructure, livelihoods, 
and people are vulnerable to associated damage. Areas with development in the coastal zone, such as on small islands, can be particularly vulnerable.

Observed: 
• Likely increase in the magnitude of extreme high sea level events since 1970, mostly explained by rising mean sea level. [WGI AR5 3.7.5]
• Low conﬁ dence in long-term (centennial) changes in tropical cyclone activity, after accounting for past changes in observing capabilities. [WGI AR5 2.6.3] 

Projected: 
• Very likely signiﬁ cant increase in the occurrence of future sea level extremes by 2050 and 2100. [WGI AR5 13.7.2]

mean tropical cyclone maximum wind speed and rainfall rates. [WGI AR5 14.6]

Climate information at the 
regional scale

Observed: Change in sea level relative to the land (relative sea level) can be signiﬁ cantly different from the global mean sea level change because of 
changes in the distribution of water in the ocean and vertical movement of the land. [WGI AR5 3.7.3]

Projected: 
• Low conﬁ dence in region-speciﬁ c projections of storminess and associated storm surges. [WGI AR5 13.7.2] 
• Projections of regional changes in sea level reach values of up to 30% above the global mean value in the Southern Ocean and around North America, and 

between 10% to 20% above the global mean value in equatorial regions. [WGI AR5 13.6.5]

• More likely than not substantial increase in the frequency of the most intense tropical cyclones in the western North Paciﬁ c and North Atlantic. [WGI AR5 14.6]

Mangrove restoration and rehabilitation has occurred in a number of locations (e.g., Vietnam, Djibouti, and Brazil) to reduce coastal ﬂ ooding risks and protect 
shorelines from storm surge. Restored mangroves have been shown to attenuate wave height and thus reduce wave damage and erosion. They protect 
aquaculture industry from storm damage and reduce saltwater intrusion.
[2.4.3, 5.5.4, 8.3.3, 22.4.5, 27.3.3]

• Considered a low-regrets option beneﬁ ting sustainable development, livelihood improvement, and human well-being through improvements for food 

security and reduced risks from ﬂ ooding, saline intrusion, wave damage, and erosion. Restoration and rehabilitation of mangroves, as well as of wetlands or 
deltas, is ecosystem-based adaptation that enhances ecosystem services.

• Synergies with mitigation given that mangrove forests represent large stores of carbon.
• Well-integrated ecosystem-based adaptation can be more cost effective and sustainable than non-integrated physical engineering approaches.

Description

Broader context

Traditional technologies and skills can be relevant for climate adaptation in small island contexts. In the Solomon Islands, relevant traditional practices include 
elevating concrete ﬂ oors to keep them dry during heavy precipitation events and building low aerodynamic houses with palm leaves as rooﬁ ng to avoid 
hazards from ﬂ ying debris during cyclones, supported by perceptions that traditional construction methods are more resilient to extreme weather. In Fiji after 
Cyclone Ami in 2003, mutual support and risk sharing formed a central pillar for community-based adaptation, with unaffected households ﬁ shing to support 
those with damaged homes. Participatory consultations across stakeholders and sectors within communities and capacity building taking into account 
traditional practices can be vital to the success of adaptation initiatives in island communities, such as in Fiji or Samoa. [29.6.2]

• Perceptions of self-efﬁ cacy and adaptive capacity in addressing climate stress can be important in determining resilience and identifying useful solutions. 
• The relevance of community-based adaptation principles to island communities, as a facilitating factor in adaptation planning and implementation, has 

been highlighted, for example, with focus on empowerment and learning-by-doing, while addressing local priorities and building on local knowledge and 
capacity. Community-based adaptation can include measures that cut across sectors and technological, social, and institutional processes, recognizing that 
technology by itself is only one component of successful adaptation.

Several governments have made ambitious efforts to address ﬂ ood risk and sea level rise over the coming century. In the Netherlands, government 
recommendations include “soft” measures preserving land from development to accommodate increased river inundation; maintaining coastal protection 
through beach nourishment; and ensuring necessary political-administrative, legal, and ﬁ nancial resources. Through a multi-stage process, the British 
government has also developed extensive adaptation plans to adjust and improve ﬂ ood defenses to protect London from future storm surges and river 
ﬂ ooding. Pathways have been analyzed for different adaptation options and decisions, depending on eventual sea level rise, with ongoing monitoring of the 
drivers of risk informing decisions. 
[5.5.4, 23.7.1, Box 5-1]

A recently introduced mechanism that has been piloted in a number of rural locations, including in Malawi, Sudan, and Ethiopia, as well as in India. When 
physical conditions reach a particular predetermined threshold where signiﬁ cant losses are expected to occur—weather conditions such as excessively high 
or low cumulative rainfall or temperature peaks—the insurance pays out. 
[9.4.2, 13.3.2, 15.4.4, Box 22-1]

• Index-based weather insurance is considered well suited to the agricultural sector in developing countries.
• The mechanism allows risk to be shared across communities, with costs spread over time, while overcoming obstacles to traditional agricultural and disaster 

insurance markets. It can be integrated with other strategies such as microﬁ nance and social protection programs. 

• Risk-based premiums can help encourage adaptive responses and foster risk awareness and risk reduction by providing ﬁ nancial incentives to policyholders 

to reduce their risk proﬁ le. 

• Challenges can be associated with limited availability of accurate weather data and difﬁ culties in establishing which weather conditions cause losses. 

Basis risk (i.e., farmers suffer losses but no payout is triggered based on weather data) can promote distrust. There can also be difﬁ culty in scaling up pilot 
schemes. 

• Insurance for work programs can enable cash-poor farmers to work for insurance premiums by engaging in community-identiﬁ ed disaster risk reduction 

projects.

Industries and individual farmers are relocating parts of their operations, for example for rice, wine, or peanuts in Australia, or are changing land use in situ 
in response to recent climate change or expectations of future change. For example, there has been some switching from grazing to cropping in southern 
Australia. Adaptive movement of crops has also occurred elsewhere.

time due to both climate change and development. This section builds
from existing experience with decision making and risk management.
It creates a foundation for understanding the report’s assessment of
future climate-related risks and potential responses.

Responding to climate-related risks involves decision making in
a changing world, with continuing uncertainty about the severity
and timing of climate-change impacts and with limits to the
effectiveness  of  adaptation  (high  confidence).  Iterative  risk
management is a useful framework for decision making in complex
situations characterized by large potential consequences, persistent
uncertainties,  long  timeframes,  potential  for  learning,  and  multiple
climatic and non-climatic influences changing over time. See Figure TS.4.
Assessment of the widest possible range of potential impacts, including
low-probability  outcomes  with  large  consequences,  is  central  to
understanding the benefits and trade-offs of alternative risk management
actions. The complexity of adaptation actions across scales and contexts
means  that  monitoring  and  learning  are  important  components  of
effective adaptation. [2.1 to 2.4, 3.6, 14.1 to 14.3, 15.2 to 15.4, 16.2 to
16.4, 17.1 to 17.3, 17.5, 20.6, 22.4, 25.4, Figure 1-5]

Adaptation and mitigation choices in the near term will affect
the risks of climate change throughout the 21st century (high

confidence). Figure TS.5 illustrates projected climate futures under a
low-emission  mitigation  scenario  and  a  high-emission  scenario
[Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 2.6 and 8.5], along
with observed temperature and precipitation changes. The benefits of
adaptation  and  mitigation  occur  over  different  but  overlapping
timeframes. Projected global temperature increase over the next few
decades is similar across emission scenarios (Figure TS.5A, middle panel)
(WGI AR5 Section 11.3). During this near-term era of committed climate
change, risks will evolve as socioeconomic trends interact with the
changing  climate.  Societal  responses,  particularly  adaptations,  will
influence near-term outcomes. In the second half of the 21st century
and  beyond,  global  temperature  increase  diverges  across  emission
scenarios (Figure TS.5A, middle and bottom panels) (WGI AR5 Section
12.4 and Table SPM.2). For this longer-term era of climate options, near-
term and longer-term adaptation and mitigation, as well as development
pathways, will determine the risks of climate change. [2.5, 21.2, 21.3,
21.5, Box CC-RC]

Assessment of risks in the WGII AR5 relies on diverse forms of
evidence. Expert judgment is used to integrate evidence into
evaluations of risks. Forms of evidence include, for example, empirical
observations,  experimental  results,  process-based  understanding,
statistical approaches, and simulation and descriptive models. Future

vulnerabilities,  sensitivities,  and  thresholds  for  specific  sectors  or
communities. Iterative assessments of impacts and adaptation in the top-
down approach and building adaptive capacity of local communities
are typical strategies for responding to uncertainties. [2.2, 2.3, 15.3]

Uncertainties about future vulnerability, exposure, and responses
of  interlinked  human  and  natural  systems  are  large  (high
confidence).  This  motivates  exploration  of  a  wide  range  of
socioeconomic  futures  in  assessments  of  risks.  Understanding
future vulnerability, exposure, and response capacity of interlinked human
and natural systems is challenging due to the number of interacting
social, economic, and cultural factors, which have been incompletely
considered to date. These factors include wealth and its distribution
across  society,  demographics,  migration,  access  to  technology  and
information, employment patterns, the quality of adaptive responses,
societal  values,  governance  structures,  and  institutions  to  resolve
conflicts. International dimensions such as trade and relations among
states are also important for understanding the risks of climate change
at regional scales. [11.3, 12.6, 21.3 to 21.5, 25.3, 25.4, 25.11, 26.2]

risks  related  to  climate  change  vary  substantially  across  plausible
alternative  development  pathways,  and  the  relative  importance  of
development and climate change varies by sector, region, and time
period (high confidence). Scenarios are useful tools for characterizing
possible  future  socioeconomic  pathways,  climate  change  and  its
risks,  and  policy  implications.  Climate-model  projections  informing
evaluations of risks in this report are generally based on the RCPs
(Figure TS.5), as well as the older IPCC Special Report on Emissions
Scenarios (SRES) scenarios. [1.1, 1.3, 2.2, 2.3, 19.6, 20.2, 21.3, 21.5, 26.2,
Box CC-RC; WGI AR5 Box SPM.1]

Scenarios can be divided into those that explore how futures
may  unfold  under  various  drivers  (problem  exploration)  and
those that test how various interventions may play out (solution
exploration)  (robust  evidence,  high  agreement).  Adaptation
approaches address uncertainties associated with future climate and
socioeconomic conditions and with the diversity of specific contexts
(medium evidence, high agreement). Although many national studies
identify a variety of strategies and approaches for adaptation, they can
be classified into two broad categories: “top-down” and “bottom-up”
approaches. The top-down approach is a scenario-impact approach,
consisting of downscaled climate projections, impact assessments, and
formulation of strategies and options. The bottom-up approach is a
vulnerability-threshold approach, starting with the identification of

Figure TS.5 | Observed and projected changes in annual average surface temperature (A) and precipitation (B). This ﬁgure informs understanding of climate-related risks in the WGII 
AR5. It illustrates changes observed to date and projected changes under continued high emissions and under ambitious mitigation. 

Technical details: (A, top panel) Map of observed annual mean temperature change from 1901–2012, derived from a linear trend. Observed data (range of grid-point values: –0.53 
to 2.50°C over period) are from WGI AR5 Figures SPM.1 and 2.21. (B, top panel) Map of observed annual precipitation change from 1951–2010, derived from a linear trend. 
Observed data (range of grid-point values: –185 to 111 mm/year per decade) are from WGI AR5 Figures SPM.2 and 2.29. For observed temperature and precipitation, trends have 
been calculated where sufﬁcient data permit a robust estimate (i.e., only for grid boxes with greater than 70% complete records and more than 20% data availability in the ﬁrst and 
last 10% of the time period). Other areas are white. Solid colors indicate areas where trends are signiﬁcant at the 10% level. Diagonal lines indicate areas where trends are not 
signiﬁcant. (A, middle panel) Observed and projected future global annual mean temperature relative to 1986–2005. Observed warming from 1850–1900 to 1986–2005 is 0.61°C 
(5–95% conﬁdence interval: 0.55 to 0.67°C). Black lines show temperature estimates from three datasets. Blue and red lines and shading denote the ensemble mean and ±1.64 
standard deviation range, based on Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) simulations from 32 models for RCP2.6 and 39 models for RCP8.5. (A and B, bottom 
panel) CMIP5 multi-model mean projections of annual mean temperature changes (A) and mean percent changes in annual mean precipitation (B) for 2081–2100 under RCP2.6 and 
8.5, relative to 1986–2005. Solid colors indicate areas with very strong agreement, where the multi-model mean change is greater than twice the baseline variability (natural internal 
variability in 20-yr means) and ≥90% of models agree on sign of change. Colors with white dots indicate areas with strong agreement, where ≥66% of models show change greater 
than the baseline variability and ≥66% of models agree on sign of change. Gray indicates areas with divergent changes, where ≥66% of models show change greater than the 
baseline variability, but <66% agree on sign of change. Colors with diagonal lines indicate areas with little or no change, where <66% of models show change greater than the 
baseline variability, although there may be signiﬁcant change at shorter timescales such as seasons, months, or days. For temperature projections, analysis uses model data (range of 
grid-point values across RCP2.6 and 8.5: 0.06 to 11.71°C) from WGI AR5 Figure SPM.8. For precipitation projections, analysis uses model data (range of grid-point values: –9 to 22% 
for RCP2.6 and –34 to 112% for RCP8.5) from WGI AR5 Figure SPM.8, Box 12.1, and Annex I. For a full description of methods, see Box CC-RC. See also Annex I of WGI AR5. [Boxes

FUTURE RISKS AND
OPPORTUNITIES FOR ADAPTATION

This section presents future risks and more limited potential benefits
across sectors and regions, examining how they are affected by the
magnitude and rate of climate change and by socioeconomic choices.
It also assesses opportunities for reducing impacts and managing risks
through adaptation and mitigation. The section examines the distribution
of risks across populations with contrasting vulnerability and adaptive
capacity, across sectors where metrics for quantifying impacts may be
quite different, and across regions with varying traditions and resources.
The assessment features interactions across sectors and regions and
among climate change and other stressors. For different sectors and
regions, the section describes risks and potential benefits over the next
few decades, the near-term era of committed climate change. Over this
timeframe,  projected  global  temperature  increase  is  similar  across
emission scenarios. The section also provides information on risks and
potential benefits in the second half of the 21st century and beyond,
the longer-term era of climate options. Over this longer term, global
temperature  increase  diverges  across  emission  scenarios,  and  the
assessment distinguishes potential outcomes for 2°C and 4°C global mean
temperature increase above preindustrial levels. The section elucidates
how and when choices matter in reducing future risks, highlighting the
differing timeframes for mitigation and adaptation benefits.

B-1. Key Risks across Sectors and Regions

Key risks are potentially severe impacts relevant to Article 2 of the UN
Framework Convention on Climate Change, which refers to “dangerous
anthropogenic interference with the climate system.” Risks are considered
key due to high hazard or high vulnerability of societies and systems
exposed, or both. Identification of key risks was based on expert judgment
using the following specific criteria: large magnitude, high probability,
or irreversibility of impacts; timing of impacts; persistent vulnerability
or exposure contributing to risks; or limited potential to reduce risks
through adaptation or mitigation. Key risks are integrated into five
complementary and overarching reasons for concern (RFCs) in Box TS.5.

The key risks that follow, all of which are identified with high
confidence, span sectors and regions. Each of these key risks
contributes to one or more RFCs. Roman numerals correspond to
entries in Table TS.3, which further illustrates relevant examples and
interactions. [19.2 to 19.4, 19.6, Table 19-4, Boxes 19-2 and CC-KR]
i)

Risk of death, injury, ill-health, or disrupted livelihoods in low-lying
coastal zones and small island developing states and other small
islands, due to storm surges, coastal flooding, and sea level rise.
See RFCs 1 to 5. [5.4, 8.2, 13.2, 19.2 to 19.4, 19.6, 19.7, 24.4, 24.5,

Table TS.3 |  A selection of the hazards, key vulnerabilities, key risks, and emergent risks identiﬁ ed in chapters of this report. The examples underscore the complexity of risks 
determined by various interacting climate-related hazards, non-climatic stressors, and multifaceted vulnerabilities (see also Figure TS.1). Vulnerabilities identiﬁ ed as key arise when 
exposure to hazards combines with social, institutional, economic, or environmental vulnerability, as indicated by icons in the table. Emergent risks arise from complex system 
interactions. Roman numerals correspond with key risks listed in Section B-1. [19.6, Table 19-4]

Box TS.5 | Human Interference with the Climate System

Human inﬂuence on the climate system is clear (WGI AR5 SPM Section D.3; WGI AR5 Sections 2.2, 6.3, 10.3 to 10.6, 10.9). Yet
determining whether such inﬂuence constitutes “dangerous anthropogenic interference” in the words of Article 2 of the UNFCCC
involves both risk assessment and value judgments. Scientiﬁc assessment can characterize risks based on the likelihood, magnitude,
and scope of potential consequences of climate change. Science can also evaluate risks varying spatially and temporally across
alternative development pathways, which affect vulnerability, exposure, and level of climate change. Interpreting the potential danger
of risks, however, also requires value judgments by people with differing goals and worldviews. Judgments about the risks of climate
change depend on the relative importance ascribed to economic versus ecosystem assets, to the present versus the future, and to the
distribution versus aggregation of impacts. From some perspectives, isolated or infrequent impacts from climate change may not rise
to the level of dangerous anthropogenic interference, but accumulation of the same kinds of impacts could, as they become more
widespread, more frequent, or more severe. The rate of climate change can also inﬂuence risks. This report assesses risks across
contexts and through time, providing a basis for judgments about the level of climate change at which risks become dangerous.

TS

Five integrative reasons for concern (RFCs) provide a framework for summarizing key risks across sectors and regions.
First identiﬁed in the IPCC Third Assessment Report, the RFCs illustrate the implications of warming and of adaptation limits for people,
economies, and ecosystems. They provide one starting point for evaluating dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate
system. Risks for each RFC, updated based on assessment of the literature and expert judgments, are presented below and in Box
TS.5 Figure 1. All temperatures below are given as global average temperature change relative to 1986–2005 (“recent”).1 [18.6, 19.6]
1) Unique and threatened systems: Some unique and threatened systems, including ecosystems and cultures, are already at risk

from climate change (high conﬁdence). The number of such systems at risk of severe consequences is higher with additional
warming of around 1°C. Many species and systems with limited adaptive capacity are subject to very high risks with additional
warming of 2°C, particularly Arctic-sea-ice and coral-reef systems.
Extreme weather events: Climate-change-related risks from extreme events, such as heat waves, extreme precipitation, and
coastal ﬂooding, are already moderate (high conﬁdence) and high with 1°C additional warming (medium conﬁdence). Risks
associated with some types of extreme events (e.g., extreme heat) increase further at higher temperatures (high conﬁdence).

2)

3) Distribution of impacts: Risks are unevenly distributed and are generally greater for disadvantaged people and communities

in countries at all levels of development. Risks are already moderate because of regionally differentiated climate-change impacts
on crop production in particular (medium to high conﬁdence). Based on projected decreases in regional crop yields and water
availability, risks of unevenly distributed impacts are high for additional warming above 2°C (medium conﬁdence).

4) Global aggregate impacts: Risks of global aggregate impacts are moderate for additional warming between 1–2°C, reﬂecting

5)

impacts to both Earth’s biodiversity and the overall global economy (medium conﬁdence). Extensive biodiversity loss with
associated loss of ecosystem goods and services results in high risks around 3°C additional warming (high conﬁdence).
Aggregate economic damages accelerate with increasing temperature (limited evidence, high agreement), but few quantitative
estimates have been completed for additional warming around 3°C or above.
Large-scale singular events: With increasing warming, some physical systems or ecosystems may be at risk of abrupt and
irreversible changes. Risks associated with such tipping points become moderate between 0–1°C additional warming, due to
early warning signs that both warm-water coral reef and Arctic ecosystems are already experiencing irreversible regime shifts
(medium conﬁdence). Risks increase disproportionately as temperature increases between 1–2°C additional warming and
become high above 3°C, due to the potential for a large and irreversible sea level rise from ice sheet loss. For sustained warming
greater than some threshold,2 near-complete loss of the Greenland ice sheet would occur over a millennium or more, contributing
up to 7 m of global mean sea level rise.

Observed warming from 1850–1900 to 1986–2005 is 0.61°C (5–95% conﬁdence interval: 0.55 to 0.67°C). [WGI AR5 2.4]
Current estimates indicate that this threshold is greater than about 1°C (low conﬁdence) but less than about 4°C (medium conﬁdence)
sustained global mean warming above preindustrial levels. [WGI AR5 SPM, 5.8, 13.4, 13.5]

Box TS.5 Figure 1 | A global perspective on climate-related risks. Risks associated with reasons for concern are shown at right for increasing levels of climate change. The color 
shading indicates the additional risk due to climate change when a temperature level is reached and then sustained or exceeded. Undetectable risk (white) indicates no 
associated impacts are detectable and attributable to climate change. Moderate risk (yellow) indicates that associated impacts are both detectable and attributable to climate 
change with at least medium conﬁdence, also accounting for the other speciﬁc criteria for key risks. High risk (red) indicates severe and widespread impacts, also accounting for 
the other speciﬁc criteria for key risks. Purple, introduced in this assessment, shows that very high risk is indicated by all speciﬁc criteria for key risks. [Figure 19-4] For reference, 
past and projected global annual average surface temperature is shown at left, as in Figure TS.5. [Figure RC-1, Box CC-RC; WGI AR5 Figures SPM.1 and SPM.7] Based on the 
longest global surface temperature dataset available, the observed change between the average of the period 1850–1900 and of the AR5 reference period (1986–2005) is 
0.61°C (5–95% conﬁdence interval: 0.55 to 0.67°C) [WGI AR5 SPM, 2.4], which is used here as an approximation of the change in global mean surface temperature since 
preindustrial times, referred to as the period before 1750. [WGI and WGII AR5 glossaries]

Many key risks constitute particular challenges for the least developed
countries and vulnerable communities, given their limited ability to
cope.

Increasing magnitudes of warming increase the likelihood of
severe, pervasive, and irreversible impacts. Some risks of climate
change are considerable at 1°C or 2°C above preindustrial levels (as
shown  in  Box TS.5).  Global  climate  change  risks  are  high  to  very
high with global mean temperature increase of 4°C or more above
preindustrial levels in all reasons for concern (Box TS.5), and include
severe and widespread impacts on unique and threatened systems,
substantial species extinction, large risks to global and regional food
security,  and  the  combination  of  high  temperature  and  humidity
compromising  normal  human  activities,  including  growing  food  or
working outdoors in some areas for parts of the year (high confidence).
See Box TS.6. The precise levels of climate change sufficient to trigger
tipping points (thresholds for abrupt and irreversible change) remain
uncertain, but the risk associated with crossing multiple tipping points
in  the  earth  system  or  in  interlinked  human  and  natural  systems
increases with rising temperature (medium confidence). [4.2, 4.3, 11.8,
19.5, 19.7, 26.5, Box CC-HS]

The overall risks of climate change impacts can be reduced by
limiting  the  rate  and  magnitude  of  climate  change.  Risks are
reduced  substantially  under  the  assessed  scenario  with  the  lowest
temperature projections (RCP2.6 – low emissions) compared to the
highest temperature projections (RCP8.5 – high emissions), particularly
in the second half of the 21st century (very high confidence). Examples
include reduced risk of negative agricultural yield impacts; of water
scarcity; of major challenges to urban settlements and infrastructure
from sea level rise; and of adverse impacts from heat extremes, floods,
and droughts in areas where increased occurrence of these extremes
is projected. Reducing climate change can also reduce the scale of
adaptation that might be required. Under all assessed scenarios for
adaptation and mitigation, some risk from adverse impacts remains (very
high confidence). Because mitigation reduces the rate as well as the
magnitude of warming, it also increases the time available for adaptation
to a particular level of climate change, potentially by several decades,
but adaptation cannot generally overcome all climate change effects.
In addition to biophysical limits to adaptation for example under high
temperatures, some adaptation options will be too costly or resource
intensive or will be cost ineffective until climate change effects grow to
merit investment costs (high confidence). Some mitigation or adaptation
options also pose risks. [3.4, 3.5, 4.2, 4.4, 16.3, 16.6, 17.2, 19.7, 20.3,
22.4, 22.5, 25.10, Tables 3-2, 8-3, and 8-6, Boxes 16-3 and 25-1]

Box TS.6 | Consequences of Large Temperature Increase

This box provides a selection of salient climate change impacts projected for large temperature rise. Warming levels described here
(e.g., 4°C warming) refer to global mean temperature increase above preindustrial levels, unless otherwise indicated.

With 4°C warming, climate change is projected to become an increasingly important driver of impacts on ecosystems, becoming
comparable with land-use change. [4.2, 19.5] A number of studies project large increases in water stress, groundwater supplies, and
drought in a number of regions with greater than 4°C warming, and decreases in others, generally placing already arid regions at
greater water stress. [19.5] 

Risks of large-scale singular events such as ice sheet disintegration, methane release from clathrates, and onset of long-term
droughts in areas such as southwest North America [19.6, Box 26-1; WGI AR5 12.4, 12.5, 13.4], as well as regime shifts in ecosystems
and substantial species loss [4.3, 19.6], are higher with increased warming. Sustained warming greater than some threshold would
lead to the near-complete loss of the Greenland ice sheet over a millennium or more, causing a global mean sea level rise of up to 7 m
(high conﬁdence); current estimates indicate that the threshold is greater than about 1°C (low conﬁdence) but less than about 4°C
(medium conﬁdence) global mean warming. [WGI AR5 SPM, 5.8, 13.4, 13.5] Abrupt and irreversible ice loss from a potential instability
of marine-based areas of the Antarctic ice sheet in response to climate forcing is possible, but current evidence and understanding is
insufﬁcient to make a quantitative assessment. [19.6; WGI AR5 SPM, 5.8, 13.4, 13.5] Sea level rise of 0.45 to 0.82 m (mean 0.63 m)
is likely by 2081–2100 under RCP8.5 (medium conﬁdence) [WGI AR5 Tables SPM.2 and 13.5], with sea level continuing to rise beyond
2100.

TS

The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) will very likely weaken over the 21st century, with a best estimate of 34%
loss (range 12 to 54%) under RCP8.5. [WGI AR5 SPM, 12.4] The release of carbon dioxide (CO2) or methane (CH4) to the atmosphere
from thawing permafrost carbon stocks over the 21st century is assessed to be in the range of 50 to 250 GtC for Representative
Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5) (low conﬁdence). [WGI AR5 SPM, 6.4] A nearly ice-free Arctic Ocean in September before mid-
century is likely under RCP8.5 (medium conﬁdence). [WGI AR5 SPM, 11.3, 12.4, 12.5]

By 2100 for the high-emission scenario RCP8.5, the combination of high temperature and humidity in some areas for parts of the
year is projected to compromise normal human activities, including growing food or working outdoors (high conﬁdence). [11.8]
Global temperature increases of ~4°C or more above late-20th-century levels, combined with increasing food demand, would pose
large risks to food security globally and regionally (high conﬁdence). [7.4, 7.5, Table 7-3, Figures 7-1, 7-4, and 7-7, Box 7-1]

Under 4°C warming, some models project large increases in ﬁre risk in parts of the world. [4.3, Figure 4-6] 4°C warming implies a
substantial increase in extinction risk for terrestrial and freshwater species, although there is low agreement concerning the fraction
of species at risk. [4.3] Widespread coral reef mortality is expected with signiﬁcant impacts on coral reef ecosystems (high conﬁdence).
[5.4, Box CC-CR] Assessments of potential ecological impacts at and above 4°C warming imply a high risk of extensive loss of
biodiversity with concomitant loss of ecosystem services (high conﬁdence). [4.3, 19.3, 19.5, Box 25-6]

Projected large increases in exposure to water stress, ﬂuvial and coastal ﬂooding, negative impacts on crop yields, and disruption of
ecosystem function and services would represent large, potentially compounding impacts of climate change on society generally and
on the global economy. [19.4 to 19.6]

of the 21st century and beyond), climate change will amplify existing
climate-related risks and create new risks for natural and human systems,
dependent on the magnitude and rate of climate change and on the
vulnerability and exposure of interlinked human and natural systems.

Some of these risks will be limited to a particular sector or region, and
others will have cascading effects. To a lesser extent, climate change
will also have some potential benefits. A selection of key sectoral risks
identified with medium to high confidence is presented in Table TS.4.

Technical Summary

Table TS.4 | Key sectoral risks from climate change and the potential for reducing risks through adaptation and mitigation. Key risks have been identiﬁed based on assessment of 
the relevant scientiﬁc, technical, and socioeconomic literature detailed in supporting chapter sections. Identiﬁcation of key risks was based on expert judgment using the following 
speciﬁc criteria: large magnitude, high probability, or irreversibility of impacts; timing of impacts; persistent vulnerability or exposure contributing to risks; or limited potential to 
reduce risks through adaptation or mitigation. Each key risk is characterized as very low to very high for three timeframes: the present, near term (here, assessed over 
2030–2040), and longer term (here, assessed over 2080–2100). The risk levels integrate probability and consequence over the widest possible range of potential outcomes, 
based on available literature. These potential outcomes result from the interaction of climate-related hazards, vulnerability, and exposure. Each risk level reﬂects total risk from 
climatic and non-climatic factors. For the near-term era of committed climate change, projected levels of global mean temperature increase do not diverge substantially for 
different emission scenarios. For the longer-term era of climate options, risk levels are presented for two scenarios of global mean temperature increase (2°C and 4°C above 
preindustrial levels). These scenarios illustrate the potential for mitigation and adaptation to reduce the risks related to climate change. For the present, risk levels were estimated 
for current adaptation and a hypothetical highly adapted state, identifying where current adaptation deﬁcits exist. For the two future timeframes, risk levels were estimated for a 
continuation of current adaptation and for a highly adapted state, representing the potential for and limits to adaptation. Climate-related drivers of impacts are indicated by 
icons. Risk levels are not necessarily comparable because the assessment considers potential impacts and adaptation in different physical, biological, and human systems across 
diverse contexts. This assessment of risks acknowledges the importance of differences in values and objectives in interpretation of the assessed risk levels.

Rapidly growing cities, or those rebuilding after a disaster, especially have 
opportunities to increase resilience, but this is rarely realized. Without 
adaptation, risks of economic losses from extreme events are substantial in 
cities with high-value infrastructure and housing assets, with broader economic

Technical Summary

For extended summary of sectoral risks and the more limited potential
benefits, see introductory overviews for each sector below and also
Chapters 3 to 13.

Freshwater Resources

Freshwater-related risks of climate change increase significantly
with increasing greenhouse gas concentrations (robust evidence,
high agreement). The fraction of global population experiencing water
scarcity and the fraction affected by major river floods increase with
the level of warming in the 21st century. See, for example, Figure TS.6.
[3.4, 3.5, 26.3, Table 3-2, Box 25-8]

TS

Climate change over the 21st century is projected to reduce
renewable surface water and groundwater resources significantly
in most dry subtropical regions (robust evidence, high agreement),
intensifying  competition  for  water  among  sectors  (limited
evidence, medium agreement). In presently dry regions, drought

frequency  will  likely increase  by  the  end  of  the  21st  century
under RCP8.5 (medium confidence). In contrast, water resources are
projected  to  increase  at  high  latitudes  (robust  evidence,  high
agreement). Climate change is projected to reduce raw water quality
and  pose  risks  to  drinking  water  quality  even  with  conventional
treatment, due to interacting factors: increased temperature; increased
sediment, nutrient, and pollutant loadings from heavy rainfall; increased
concentration  of  pollutants  during  droughts;  and  disruption  of
treatment facilities during floods (medium evidence, high agreement).
[3.2, 3.4, 3.5, 22.3, 23.9, 25.5, 26.3, Tables 3-2 and 23-3, Boxes CC-RF
and CC-WE; WGI AR5 12.4]

Adaptive  water  management  techniques,  including  scenario
planning, learning-based approaches, and flexible and low-regret
solutions, can help create resilience to uncertain hydrological
changes and impacts due to climate change (limited evidence,
high agreement). Barriers to progress include lack of human and
institutional capacity, financial resources, awareness, and communication.

Terrestrial and Freshwater Ecosystems

Climate change is projected to be a powerful stressor on terrestrial
and freshwater ecosystems in the second half of the 21st century,
especially under high-warming scenarios such as RCP6.0 and
8.5 (high confidence). Through to 2040 globally, direct human
impacts such as land-use change, pollution, and water resource
development  will  continue  to  dominate  threats  to  most
freshwater ecosystems (high confidence) and most terrestrial
ecosystems (medium confidence). Many species will be unable to
track suitable climates under mid- and high-range rates of climate
change (i.e., RCP4.5, 6.0, and 8.5) during the 21st century (medium
confidence).  Lower  rates  of  change  (i.e.,  RCP2.6)  will  pose  fewer
problems. See Figure TS.7. Some species will adapt to new climates.
Those that cannot adapt sufficiently fast will decrease in abundance or
go extinct in part or all of their ranges. Increased tree mortality and
associated forest dieback is projected to occur in many regions over
the 21st century, due to increased temperatures and drought (medium
confidence). Forest dieback poses risks for carbon storage, biodiversity,
wood  production,  water  quality,  amenity,  and  economic  activity.
Management actions, such as maintenance of genetic diversity, assisted
species migration and dispersal, manipulation of disturbance regimes
(e.g., fires, floods), and reduction of other stressors, can reduce, but not
eliminate, risks of impacts to terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems

due to climate change, as well as increase the inherent capacity of
ecosystems and their species to adapt to a changing climate (high
confidence). [4.3, 4.4, 25.6, 26.4, Boxes 4-2, 4-3, and CC-RF]

A large fraction of both terrestrial and freshwater species faces
increased extinction risk under projected climate change during
and  beyond  the  21st  century,  especially  as  climate  change
interacts with other stressors, such as habitat modification, over-
exploitation, pollution, and invasive species (high confidence).
Extinction risk is increased under all RCP scenarios, with risk increasing
with both magnitude and rate of climate change. Models project that the
risk of species extinctions will increase in the future due to climate change,
but there is low agreement concerning the fraction of species at increased
risk, the regional and taxonomic distribution of such extinctions, and the
timeframe over which extinctions could occur. Some aspects leading to
uncertainty in the quantitative projections of extinction risks were not
taken into account in previous models; as more realistic details are
included, it has been shown that the extinction risks may be either
under- or overestimated when based on simpler models. [4.3, 25.6]

Within this century, magnitudes and rates of climate change
associated with medium- to high-emission scenarios (RCP4.5,
6.0, and 8.5) pose high risk of abrupt and irreversible regional-
scale  change  in  the  composition,  structure,  and  function  of

Technical Summary

terrestrial  and  freshwater  ecosystems,  including  wetlands
(medium  confidence).  Examples  that  could  lead  to  substantial
impact  on  climate  are  the  boreal–tundra  Arctic  system  (medium
confidence)  and  the  Amazon  forest  (low  confidence).  For  the
boreal–tundra system, continued climate change will transform the
species composition, land cover, drainage, and permafrost extent of the
boreal–tundra system, leading to decreased albedo and the release of
greenhouse gases (medium confidence), with adaptation measures
unable  to  prevent  substantial  change  (high  confidence).  Increased
severe drought together with land-use change and forest fire would
cause much of the Amazon forest to transform to less-dense drought-
and  fire-adapted  ecosystems,  increasing  risk  for  biodiversity  while
decreasing net carbon uptake from the atmosphere (low confidence).
Large  reductions  in  deforestation,  as  well  as  wider  application  of
effective wildfire management, will lower the risk of abrupt change in
the Amazon,  as  well  as  potential  negative  impacts  of  that  change
(medium confidence). [4.2, 4.3, Figure 4-8, Boxes 4-3 and 4-4]

The natural carbon sink provided by terrestrial ecosystems is
partially  offset  at  the  decadal  timescale  by  carbon  released
through the conversion of natural ecosystems (principally forests)
to farm and grazing land and through ecosystem degradation
(high confidence). Carbon stored in the terrestrial biosphere (e.g., in
peatlands,  permafrost,  and  forests)  is  susceptible  to  loss  to  the
atmosphere as a result of climate change, deforestation, and ecosystem
degradation. [4.2, 4.3, Box 4-3]

Coastal Systems and Low-lying Areas

Due to sea level rise projected throughout the 21st century and
beyond, coastal systems and low-lying areas will increasingly
experience adverse impacts such as submergence, coastal flooding,
and coastal erosion (very high confidence). The population and
assets projected to be exposed to coastal risks as well as human pressures
on coastal ecosystems will increase significantly in the coming decades
due to population growth, economic development, and urbanization
(high confidence). The relative costs of coastal adaptation vary strongly
among and within regions and countries for the 21st century. Some
low-lying developing countries and small island states are expected to
face  very  high  impacts  that,  in  some  cases,  could  have  associated
damage and adaptation costs of several percentage points of GDP. [5.3
to 5.5, 8.2, 22.3, 24.4, 25.6, 26.3, 26.8, Table 26-1, Box 25-1]

Marine Systems

By mid 21st century, spatial shifts of marine species will cause
species richness and fisheries catch potential to increase, on

average,  at  mid  and  high  latitudes  (high  confidence)  and  to
decrease at tropical latitudes (medium confidence), resulting in
global redistribution of catch potential for fishes and invertebrates,
with implications for food security (medium confidence). Spatial
shifts of marine species due to projected warming will cause high-
latitude invasions and high local-extinction rates in the tropics and
semi-enclosed seas (medium confidence). Animal displacements will
cause a 30 to 70% increase in the fisheries yield of some high-latitude
regions by 2055 (relative to 2005), a redistribution at mid latitudes, and
a drop of 40 to 60% in some of the tropics and the Antarctic, for 2°C
warming above preindustrial levels (medium confidence for direction
of fisheries’ yield trends, low confidence for the precise magnitudes of
yield change). See Figure TS.8A. The progressive expansion of oxygen
minimum  zones  and  anoxic  “dead  zones”  is  projected  to  further
constrain  the  habitat  of  fishes  and  other  O2-dependent  organisms
(medium confidence). Open-ocean net primary production is projected
to redistribute and, by 2100, fall globally under all RCP scenarios. [6.3
to 6.5, 7.4, 25.6, 28.3, 30.4 to 30.6, Boxes CC-MB and CC-PP]

Due to projected climate change by the mid 21st century and
beyond,  global  marine-species  redistribution  and  marine-
biodiversity reduction in sensitive regions will challenge the
sustained provision of fisheries productivity and other ecosystem
goods and services (high confidence). Socioeconomic vulnerability
is highest in developing tropical countries, leading to risks from reduced
supplies, income, and employment from marine fisheries. [6.4, 6.5]

For medium- to high-emission scenarios (RCP4.5, 6.0, and 8.5),
ocean acidification poses substantial risks to marine ecosystems,
especially  polar  ecosystems  and  coral  reefs,  associated  with
impacts on the physiology, behavior, and population dynamics
of individual species from phytoplankton to animals (medium to
high confidence). See Box TS.7. Highly calcified mollusks, echinoderms,
and  reef-building  corals  are  more  sensitive  than  crustaceans  (high
confidence) and fishes (low confidence), with potentially detrimental
consequences  for  fisheries  and  livelihoods  (Figure  TS.8B).  Ocean
acidification acts together with other global changes (e.g., warming,
decreasing  oxygen  levels)  and  with  local  changes  (e.g.,  pollution,
eutrophication) (high confidence). Simultaneous drivers, such as warming
and ocean acidification, can lead to interactive, complex, and amplified
impacts for species and ecosystems. [5.4, 6.3 to 6.5, 22.3, 25.6, 28.3,
30.5, Boxes CC-CR and CC-OA]

Climate change adds to the threats of over-fishing and other
non-climatic stressors, thus complicating marine management
regimes (high confidence). In the short term, strategies including
climate forecasting and early warning systems can reduce risks from
ocean warming and acidification for some fisheries and aquaculture
industries. Fisheries and aquaculture industries with high-technology

crustacean ﬁsheries (present-day estimated annual catch rates ≥0.005 tonnes km–2) and known locations of cold- and warm-water corals, depicted on a global map showing the 
projected distribution of ocean acidiﬁcation under RCP8.5 (pH change from 1986–2005 to 2081–2100). [WGI AR5 Figure SPM.8] The bottom panel compares sensitivity to 
ocean acidiﬁcation across mollusks, crustaceans, and corals, vulnerable animal phyla with socioeconomic relevance (e.g., for coastal protection and ﬁsheries). The number of 
species analyzed across studies is given for each category of elevated CO2. For 2100, RCP scenarios falling within each CO2 partial pressure (pCO2) category are as follows: 
RCP4.5 for 500–650 μatm (approximately equivalent to ppm in the atmosphere), RCP6.0 for 651–850 μatm, and RCP8.5 for 851–1370 μatm. By 2150, RCP8.5 falls within the 
1371–2900 μatm category. The control category corresponds to 380 μatm. [6.1, 6.3, 30.5, Figures 6-10 and 6-14; WGI AR5 Box SPM.1]

Figure TS.9 | Summary of projected changes in crop yields, due to climate change over the 21st century. The ﬁgure includes projections for different emission scenarios, for 
tropical and temperate regions, and for adaptation and no-adaptation cases combined. Relatively few studies have considered impacts on cropping systems for scenarios where 
global mean temperatures increase by 4°C or more. For ﬁve timeframes in the near term and long term, data (n=1090) are plotted in the 20-year period on the horizontal axis 
that includes the midpoint of each future projection period. Changes in crop yields are relative to late-20th-century levels. Data for each timeframe sum to 100%. [Figure 7-5]

and/or large investments, as well as marine shipping and oil and gas
industries, have high capacities for adaptation due to greater development
of environmental monitoring, modeling, and resource assessments.
For smaller-scale fisheries and developing countries, building social
resilience, alternative livelihoods, and occupational flexibility represent
important strategies for reducing the vulnerability of ocean-dependent
human communities. [6.4, 7.3, 7.4, 25.6, 29.4, 30.6, 30.7]

Food Security and Food Production Systems

For  the  major  crops  (wheat,  rice,  and  maize)  in  tropical  and
temperate  regions,  climate  change  without  adaptation  is
projected to negatively impact aggregate production for local
temperature increases of 2°C or more above late-20th-century
levels,  although  individual  locations  may  benefit  (medium
confidence). Projected impacts vary across crops and regions and
adaptation scenarios, with about 10% of projections for the period
2030–2049 showing yield gains of more than 10%, and about 10% of
projections showing yield losses of more than 25%, compared to the
late 20th century. After 2050 the risk of more severe yield impacts
increases and depends on the level of warming. See Figure TS.9. Climate
change is projected to progressively increase inter-annual variability of
crop yields in many regions. These projected impacts will occur in the
context of rapidly rising crop demand. [7.4, 7.5, 22.3, 24.4, 25.7, 26.5,
Table 7-2, Figures 7-4, 7-5, 7-6, 7-7, and 7-8]

All aspects of food security are potentially affected by climate
change,  including  food  access,  utilization,  and  price  stability
(high confidence). Redistribution of marine fisheries catch potential
towards higher latitudes poses risk of reduced supplies, income, and
employment in tropical countries, with potential implications for food
security (medium confidence). Global temperature increases of ~4°C or
more above late-20th-century levels, combined with increasing food

demand, would pose large risks to food security globally and regionally
(high confidence). Risks to food security are generally greater in low-
latitude areas. [6.3 to 6.5, 7.4, 7.5, 9.3, 22.3, 24.4, 25.7, 26.5, Table 7-3,
Figures 7-1, 7-4, and 7-7, Box 7-1]

Urban Areas

Many global risks of climate change are concentrated in urban
areas (medium confidence). Steps that build resilience and enable
sustainable  development  can  accelerate  successful  climate-
change  adaptation  globally.  Heat  stress,  extreme  precipitation,
inland and coastal flooding, landslides, air pollution, drought, and water
scarcity pose risks in urban areas for people, assets, economies, and
ecosystems (very high confidence). Risks are amplified for those lacking
essential infrastructure and services or living in poor-quality housing
and exposed areas. Reducing basic service deficits, improving housing,
and building resilient infrastructure systems could significantly reduce
vulnerability and exposure in urban areas. Urban adaptation benefits from
effective multi-level urban risk governance, alignment of policies and
incentives, strengthened local government and community adaptation
capacity, synergies with the private sector, and appropriate financing
and institutional development (medium confidence). Increased capacity,
voice, and influence of low-income groups and vulnerable communities
and their partnerships with local governments also benefit adaptation.
[3.5, 8.2 to 8.4, 22.3, 24.4, 24.5, 26.8, Table 8-2, Boxes 25-9 and CC-HS]

Rural Areas

Major future rural impacts are expected in the near term and
beyond through impacts on water availability and supply, food
security, and agricultural incomes, including shifts in production
areas  of  food  and  non-food  crops  across  the  world  (high

                                                                                                                                                                                                          Technical Summary

confidence). These impacts are expected to disproportionately affect the
welfare of the poor in rural areas, such as female-headed households
and  those  with  limited  access  to  land,  modern  agricultural  inputs,
infrastructure, and education. Climate change will increase international
agricultural trade volumes in both physical and value terms (limited
evidence, medium agreement). Importing food can help countries adjust
to climate change-induced domestic productivity shocks while short-
term food deficits in developing countries with low income may have
to be met through food aid. Further adaptations for agriculture, water,
forestry, and biodiversity can occur through policies taking account of
rural decision-making contexts. Trade reform and investment can improve
market access for small-scale farms (medium confidence). Valuation of
non-marketed ecosystem services and limitations of economic valuation
models that aggregate across contexts pose challenges for valuing rural
impacts. [9.3, 25.9, 26.8, 28.2, 28.4, Box 25-5] 

Key Economic Sectors and Services

For most economic sectors, the impacts of drivers such as changes
in population, age structure, income, technology, relative prices,
lifestyle, regulation, and governance are projected to be large
relative to the impacts of climate change (medium evidence,
high  agreement).  Climate  change  is  projected  to  reduce  energy
demand for heating and increase energy demand for cooling in the
residential and commercial sectors (robust evidence, high agreement).
Climate change is projected to affect energy sources and technologies
differently, depending on resources (e.g., water flow, wind, insolation),
technological processes (e.g., cooling), or locations (e.g., coastal regions,
floodplains) involved. More severe and/or frequent extreme weather
events and/or hazard types are projected to increase losses and loss
variability in various regions and challenge insurance systems to offer
affordable coverage while raising more risk-based capital, particularly in
developing countries. Large-scale public-private risk reduction initiatives
and economic diversification are examples of adaptation actions. [3.5,
10.2, 10.7, 10.10, 17.4, 17.5, 25.7, 26.7 to 26.9, Box 25-7]

Climate change may influence the integrity and reliability of
pipelines  and  electricity  grids  (medium  evidence,  medium
agreement). Climate change may require changes in design standards
for the construction and operation of pipelines and of power transmission
and  distribution  lines.  Adopting  existing  technology  from  other
geographical and climatic conditions may reduce the cost of adapting
new infrastructure as well as the cost of retrofitting existing pipelines
and grids. Climate change may negatively affect transport infrastructure
(limited  evidence,  high  agreement). All  infrastructure  is  vulnerable
to  freeze-thaw  cycles;  paved  roads  are  particularly  vulnerable  to
temperature  extremes,  unpaved  roads  and  bridges  to  precipitation
extremes. Transport infrastructure on ice or permafrost is especially
vulnerable. [10.2, 10.4, 25.7, 26.7]

Climate  change  will  affect  tourism  resorts,  particularly  ski
resorts, beach resorts, and nature resorts (robust evidence, high
agreement), and tourists may spend their holidays at higher
altitudes and latitudes (medium evidence, high agreement). The
economic implications of climate-change-induced changes in tourism
demand and supply entail gains for countries closer to the poles and

countries with higher elevations and losses for other countries. [10.6,
25.7]

Global economic impacts from climate change are difficult to
estimate. Economic impact estimates completed over the past 20 years
vary in their coverage of subsets of economic sectors and depend on a
large number of assumptions, many of which are disputable, and many
estimates do not account for catastrophic changes, tipping points, and
many other factors. With these recognized limitations, the incomplete
estimates of global annual economic losses for additional temperature
increases of ~2°C are between 0.2 and 2.0% of income (±1 standard
deviation around the mean) (medium evidence, medium agreement).
Losses are more likely than not to be greater, rather than smaller, than
this range (limited evidence, high agreement). Additionally, there are
large  differences  between  and  within  countries.  Losses  accelerate
with  greater  warming  (limited  evidence,  high  agreement),  but  few
quantitative estimates have been completed for additional warming
around 3°C or above. Estimates of the incremental economic impact of
emitting carbon dioxide lie between a few dollars and several hundreds
of dollars per tonne of carbon3 (robust evidence, medium agreement).
Estimates vary strongly with the assumed damage function and discount
rate. [10.9]

Human Health

Until mid-century, projected climate change will impact human
health mainly by exacerbating health problems that already exist
(very high confidence). Throughout the 21st century, climate
change is expected to lead to increases in ill-health in many
regions and especially in developing countries with low income, as
compared to a baseline without climate change (high confidence).
Examples include greater likelihood of injury, disease, and death due to
more intense heat waves and fires (very high confidence); increased
likelihood of under-nutrition resulting from diminished food production
in poor regions (high confidence); risks from lost work capacity and
reduced labor productivity in vulnerable populations; and increased risks
from food- and water-borne diseases (very high confidence) and vector-
borne diseases (medium confidence). Impacts on health will be reduced,
but not eliminated, in populations that benefit from rapid social and
economic  development,  particularly  among  the  poorest  and  least
healthy groups (high confidence). Climate change will increase demands
for health care services and facilities, including public health programs,
disease prevention activities, health care personnel, infrastructure, and
supplies for treatment (medium evidence, high agreement). Positive
effects  are  expected  to  include  modest  reductions  in  cold-related
mortality and morbidity in some areas due to fewer cold extremes (low
confidence), geographical shifts in food production (medium confidence),
and reduced capacity of vectors to transmit some diseases. But globally
over the 21st century, the magnitude and severity of negative impacts
are projected to increasingly outweigh positive impacts (high confidence).
The most effective vulnerability reduction measures for health in the
near  term  are  programs  that  implement  and  improve  basic  public
health measures such as provision of clean water and sanitation, secure
essential health care including vaccination and child health services,

Figure TS.10 | Conceptual presentation of health risks from climate change and the potential for risk reduction through adaptation. Risks are identiﬁed in eight health-related 
categories based on assessment of the literature and expert judgments by authors of Chapter 11. The width of the slices indicates in a qualitative way relative importance in 
terms of burden of ill-health globally at present. Risk levels are assessed for the present and for the near-term era of committed climate change (here, for 2030–2040). For some 
categories, for example, vector-borne diseases, heat/cold stress, and agricultural production and undernutrition, there may be beneﬁts to health in some areas, but the net impact 
is expected to be negative. Risk levels are also presented for the longer-term era of climate options (here, for 2080–2100) for global mean temperature increase of 4°C above 
preindustrial levels. For each timeframe, risk levels are estimated for the current state of adaptation and for a hypothetical highly adapted state, indicated by different colors.

increase capacity for disaster preparedness and response, and alleviate
poverty (very high confidence). By 2100 for the high-emission scenario
RCP8.5, the combination of high temperature and humidity in some
areas for parts of the year is projected to compromise normal human
activities, including growing food or working outdoors (high confidence).
See Figure TS.10. [8.2, 11.3 to 11.8, 19.3, 22.3, 25.8, 26.6, Figure 25-5,
Box CC-HS]

Human Security

Human security will be progressively threatened as the climate
changes (robust evidence, high agreement). Human insecurity almost

never has single causes, but instead emerges from the interaction of
multiple factors. Climate change is an important factor in threats to human
security through (1) undermining livelihoods, (2) compromising culture
and identity, (3) increasing migration that people would rather have
avoided, and (4) challenging the ability of states to provide the conditions
necessary for human security. See Figure TS.11. [12.1 to 12.4, 12.6]

Climate change will compromise the cultural values that are
important for community and individual well-being (medium
evidence, high agreement). The effect of climate change on culture
will vary across societies and over time, depending on cultural resilience
and  the  mechanisms  for  maintaining  and  transferring  knowledge.
Changing weather and climatic conditions threaten cultural practices

embedded in livelihoods and expressed in narratives, worldviews, identity,
community cohesion, and sense of place. Loss of land and displacement,
for  example,  on  small  islands  and  coastal  communities,  have  well
documented negative cultural and well-being impacts. [12.3, 12.4]

Climate change over the 21st century is projected to increase
displacement of people (medium evidence, high agreement).
Displacement risk increases when populations that lack the resources
for planned migration experience higher exposure to extreme weather
events, in both rural and urban areas, particularly in developing countries
with  low  income.  Expanding  opportunities  for  mobility  can  reduce
vulnerability for such populations. Changes in migration patterns can
be responses to both extreme weather events and longer-term climate
variability and change, and migration can also be an effective adaptation
strategy. There is low confidence in quantitative projections of changes
in mobility, due to its complex, multi-causal nature. [9.3, 12.4, 19.4,
22.3, 25.9]

Climate change can indirectly increase risks of violent conflicts
in the form of civil war and inter-group violence by amplifying
well-documented drivers of these conflicts such as poverty and
economic shocks (medium confidence). Multiple lines of evidence
relate climate variability to these forms of conflict. [12.5, 13.2, 19.4]

The impacts of climate change on the critical infrastructure and
territorial integrity of many states are expected to influence

national security policies (medium evidence, medium agreement).
For example, land inundation due to sea level rise poses risks to the
territorial integrity of small island states and states with extensive
coastlines. Some transboundary impacts of climate change, such as
changes in sea ice, shared water resources, and pelagic fish stocks, have
the potential to increase rivalry among states, but robust national and
intergovernmental institutions can enhance cooperation and manage
many of these rivalries. [12.5, 12.6, 23.9, 25.9]

Livelihoods and Poverty

Throughout the 21st century, climate-change impacts are projected
to slow down economic growth, make poverty reduction more
difficult, further erode food security, and prolong existing and
create new poverty traps, the latter particularly in urban areas
and emerging hotspots of hunger (medium confidence). Climate-
change impacts are expected to exacerbate poverty in most developing
countries and create new poverty pockets in countries with increasing
inequality, in both developed and developing countries. In urban and
rural  areas,  wage-labor-dependent  poor  households  that  are  net
buyers of food are expected to be particularly affected due to food
price increases, including in regions with high food insecurity and high
inequality (particularly in Africa), although the agricultural self-employed
could benefit. Insurance programs, social protection measures, and
disaster risk management may enhance long-term livelihood resilience

Technical Summary

Box TS.7 | Ocean Acidiﬁcation

Anthropogenic ocean acidiﬁcation and global warming share the same primary cause, which is the increase of atmospheric CO2
(Box TS.7 Figure 1A). [WGI AR5 2.2] Eutrophication, upwelling, and deposition of atmospheric nitrogen and sulfur contribute to ocean
acidiﬁcation locally. [5.3, 6.1, 30.3] The fundamental chemistry of ocean acidiﬁcation is well understood (robust evidence, high
agreement). [30.3; WGI AR5 3.8, 6.4] It has been more difﬁcult to understand and project changes within the more complex coastal
systems. [5.3, 30.3] 

TS

Ocean acidiﬁcation acts together with other global changes (e.g., warming, decreasing oxygen levels) and with local changes (e.g.,
pollution, eutrophication) (high conﬁdence). Simultaneous drivers, such as warming and ocean acidiﬁcation, can lead to interactive,
complex, and ampliﬁed impacts for species and ecosystems. A pattern of positive and negative impacts of ocean acidiﬁcation
emerges for processes and organisms (high conﬁdence; Box TS.7 Figure 1B), but key uncertainties remain from organismal to
ecosystem levels. A wide range of sensitivities exists within and across organisms, with higher sensitivity in early life stages. [6.3]
Lower pH decreases the rate of calciﬁcation of most, but not all, sea ﬂoor calciﬁers, reducing their competitiveness with non-calciﬁers
(robust evidence, medium agreement). [5.4, 6.3] Ocean acidiﬁcation stimulates dissolution of calcium carbonate (very high conﬁdence).
Growth and primary production are stimulated in seagrasses and some phytoplankton (high conﬁdence), and harmful algal blooms
could become more frequent (limited evidence, medium agreement). Serious behavioral disturbances have been reported in ﬁshes

Box TS.7 (continued)

(high conﬁdence). [6.3] Natural analogs at CO2 vents indicate decreased species diversity, biomass, and trophic complexity. Shifts in
organisms’ performance and distribution will change both predator-prey and competitive interactions, which could impact food webs
and higher trophic levels (limited evidence, high agreement). [6.3]

A few studies provide limited evidence for adaptation in phytoplankton and mollusks. However, mass extinctions in Earth history
occurred during much slower rates of change in ocean acidiﬁcation, combined with other drivers, suggesting that evolutionary rates
may be too slow for sensitive and long-lived species to adapt to the projected rates of future change (medium conﬁdence). [6.1]

The biological, ecological, and biogeochemical changes driven by ocean acidiﬁcation will affect key ecosystem services. The oceans
will become less efﬁcient at absorbing CO2 and hence moderating climate (very high conﬁdence). [WGI AR5 Figure 6.26] The impacts
of ocean acidiﬁcation on coral reefs, together with those of thermal stress (driving mass coral bleaching and mortality) and sea level
rise, will diminish their role in shoreline protection as well as their direct and indirect beneﬁts to ﬁshing and tourism industries (limited
evidence, high agreement). [Box CC-CR] The global cost of production loss of mollusks could be over US$100 billion by 2100 (low
conﬁdence). The largest uncertainty is how the impacts on lower trophic levels will propagate through the food webs and to top
predators. Models suggest that ocean acidiﬁcation will generally reduce ﬁsh biomass and catch (low conﬁdence) and complex
additive, antagonistic, and/or synergistic interactions will occur with disruptive ramiﬁcations for ecosystems as well as for important
ecosystem goods and services.

multidimensional inequalities. [8.1, 8.3, 8.4, 9.3, 10.9, 13.2 to 13.4, 22.3,
26.8]

B-3. Regional Risks and Potential for Adaptation

Risks will vary through time across regions and populations, dependent
on myriad factors including the extent of adaptation and mitigation. A
selection of key regional risks identified with medium to high confidence
is presented in Table TS.5. Projected changes in climate and increasing
atmospheric CO2 will have positive effects for some sectors in some
locations. For extended summary of regional risks and the more limited
potential benefits, see introductory overviews for each region below
and also WGII AR5 Part B: Regional Aspects, Chapters 21 to 30.

Africa.  Climate  change  will  amplify  existing  stress  on  water
availability and on agricultural systems particularly in semi-arid
environments (high confidence). Increasing temperatures and changes
in precipitation are very likely to reduce cereal crop productivity with
strong adverse effects on food security (high confidence). Progress has
been  achieved  on  managing  risks  to  food  production  from  current
climate variability and near-term climate change, but this will not be
sufficient to address long-term impacts of climate change. Adaptive
agricultural processes such as collaborative, participatory research that
includes scientists and farmers, strengthened communication systems
for anticipating and responding to climate risks, and increased flexibility
in  livelihood  options  provide  potential  pathways  for  strengthening
adaptive capacities. Climate change is a multiplier of existing health

vulnerabilities including insufficient access to safe water and improved
sanitation,  food  insecurity,  and  limited  access  to  health  care  and
education. Strategies that integrate consideration of climate change risks
with land and water management and disaster risk reduction bolster
resilient development. [22.3 to 22.4, 22.6]

Europe. Climate change will increase the likelihood of systemic
failures  across  European  countries  caused  by  extreme  climate
events affecting multiple sectors (medium confidence). Sea level rise
and increases in extreme rainfall are projected to further increase coastal
and river flood risks and without adaptive measures will substantially
increase flood damages (i.e., people affected and economic losses);
adaptation can prevent most of the projected damages (high confidence).
Heat-related deaths and injuries are likely to increase, particularly in
southern Europe (medium confidence). Climate change is likely to increase
cereal crop yields in northern Europe (medium confidence) but decrease
yields in southern Europe (high confidence). Climate change will increase
irrigation needs in Europe, and future irrigation will be constrained by
reduced runoff, demand from other sectors, and economic costs, with
integrated water management a strategy for addressing competing
demands. Hydropower production is likely to decrease in all sub-regions
except Scandinavia. Climate change is very likely to cause changes in
habitats and species, with local extinctions (high confidence), continental-
scale shifts in species distributions (medium confidence), and significantly
reduced alpine plant habitat (high confidence). Climate change is likely
to entail the loss or displacement of coastal wetlands. The introduction
and expansion of invasive species, especially those with high migration
rates, from outside Europe is likely to increase with climate change
(medium confidence). [23.2 to 23.9]

75

Technical Summary

Asia. Climate change will cause declines in agricultural productivity
in  many  sub-regions  of Asia,  for  crops  such  as  rice  (medium
confidence). In Central Asia, cereal production in northern and eastern
Kazakhstan could benefit from the longer growing season, warmer
winters, and slight increase in winter precipitation, while droughts in
western Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan could negatively affect cotton
production,  increase  water  demand  for  irrigation,  and  exacerbate
desertification. The effectiveness of potential and practiced agricultural
adaptation strategies is not well understood. Future projections of
precipitation at sub-regional scales and thus of freshwater availability
in most parts of Asia are uncertain (low confidence in projections), but
increased  water  demand  from  population  growth,  increased  water
consumption per capita, and lack of good management will increase
water scarcity challenges for most of the region (medium confidence).
Adaptive responses include integrated water management strategies,
such as development of water-saving technologies, increased water
productivity, and water reuse. Extreme climate events will have an

increasing impact on human health, security, livelihoods, and poverty,
with  the  type  and  magnitude  of  impact  varying  across Asia  (high
confidence). In many parts of Asia, observed terrestrial impacts, such as
permafrost degradation and shifts in plant species’ distributions, growth
rates, and timing of seasonal activities, will increase due to climate
change projected during the 21st century. Coastal and marine systems
in Asia, such as mangroves, seagrass beds, salt marshes, and coral reefs,
are under increasing stress from climatic and non-climatic drivers. In
the Asian Arctic, sea level rise interacting with projected changes in
permafrost and the length of the ice-free season will increase rates of
coastal erosion (medium evidence, high agreement). [24.4, 30.5]

Australasia.  Without  adaptation,  further  changes  in  climate,
atmospheric carbon dioxide, and ocean acidity are projected to
have substantial impacts on water resources, coastal ecosystems,
infrastructure,  health,  agriculture,  and  biodiversity  (high
confidence).  Freshwater  resources  are  projected  to  decline  in  far

TS

Table TS.5 | Key regional risks from climate change and the potential for reducing risks through adaptation and mitigation. Key risks have been identiﬁed based on assessment of the relevant 
scientiﬁc, technical, and socioeconomic literature detailed in supporting chapter sections. Identiﬁcation of key risks was based on expert judgment using the following speciﬁc criteria: large 
magnitude, high probability, or irreversibility of impacts; timing of impacts; persistent vulnerability or exposure contributing to risks; or limited potential to reduce risks through adaptation or 
mitigation. Each key risk is characterized as very low to very high for three timeframes: the present, near term (here, assessed over 2030–2040), and longer term (here, assessed over 2080–2100). 
The risk levels integrate probability and consequence over the widest possible range of potential outcomes, based on available literature. These potential outcomes result from the interaction of 
climate-related hazards, vulnerability, and exposure. Each risk level reﬂects total risk from climatic and non-climatic factors. For the near-term era of committed climate change, projected levels of 
global mean temperature increase do not diverge substantially for different emission scenarios. For the longer-term era of climate options, risk levels are presented for two scenarios of global mean 
temperature increase (2°C and 4°C above preindustrial levels). These scenarios illustrate the potential for mitigation and adaptation to reduce the risks related to climate change. For the present, 
risk levels were estimated for current adaptation and a hypothetical highly adapted state, identifying where current adaptation deﬁcits exist. For the two future timeframes, risk levels were 
estimated for a continuation of current adaptation and for a highly adapted state, representing the potential for and limits to adaptation. Climate-related drivers of impacts are indicated by icons. 
Key risks and risk levels vary across regions and over time, given differing socioeconomic development pathways, vulnerability and exposure to hazards, adaptive capacity, and risk perceptions. Risk 
levels are not necessarily comparable, especially across regions, because the assessment considers potential impacts and adaptation in different physical, biological, and human systems across 
diverse contexts. This assessment of risks acknowledges the importance of differences in values and objectives in interpretation of the assessed risk levels.

southwest and far southeast mainland Australia (high confidence) and
for some rivers in New Zealand (medium confidence). Rising sea levels
and increasing heavy rainfall are projected to increase erosion and
inundation, with consequent damages to many low-lying ecosystems,
infrastructure, and housing (high confidence); increasing heat waves will
increase risks to human health; rainfall changes and rising temperatures
will shift agricultural production zones; and many native species will
suffer from range contractions and some may face local or even global
extinction. Uncertainty in projected rainfall changes remains large for
many parts of Australia and New Zealand, which creates significant
challenges for adaptation. Some sectors in some locations have the
potential to benefit from projected changes in climate and increasing
atmospheric CO2, for example due to reduced energy demand for winter

heating in New Zealand and southern parts of Australia, and due to
forest growth in cooler regions except where soil nutrients or rainfall

have higher than average exposure to climate change due to a heavy
reliance  on  climate-sensitive  primary  industries  and  strong  social
connections to the natural environment, and face additional constraints

[26.4, 26.8, Box 26-2]

• Some ecosystems are more ﬁre-adapted than others. Forest managers and 
municipal planners are increasingly incorporating ﬁre protection measures (e.g., 
prescribed burning, introduction of resilient vegetation). Institutional capacity to 
support ecosystem adaptation is limited. 
• Adaptation of human settlements is constrained by rapid private property 
development in high-risk areas and by limited household-level adaptive capacity.
• Agroforestry can be an effective strategy for reduction of slash and burn 
practices in Mexico.

Heat-related human mortality

[26.6, 26.8]

• Residential air conditioning (A/C) can effectively reduce risk. However, 
availability and usage of A/C is highly variable and is subject to complete loss 
during power failures. Vulnerable populations include athletes and outdoor 
workers for whom A/C is not available. 
• Community- and household-scale adaptations have the potential to reduce 
exposure to heat extremes via family support, early heat warning systems, 
cooling centers, greening, and high-albedo surfaces.

[26.2 to 26.4, 26.8]

• Implementing management of urban drainage is expensive and disruptive to 
urban areas. 
• Low-regret strategies with co-beneﬁts include less impervious surfaces leading 
to more groundwater recharge, green infrastructure, and rooftop gardens. 
• Sea level rise increases water elevations in coastal outfalls, which impedes 
drainage. In many cases, older rainfall design standards are being used that need 
to be updated to reﬂect current climate conditions.
• Conservation of wetlands, including mangroves, and land-use planning 
strategies can reduce the intensity of ﬂood events.

change will amplify risks to water resources already affected by non-
climatic stressors, with potential impacts associated with decreased
snowpack, decreased water quality, urban flooding, and decreased
water supplies for urban areas and irrigation (high confidence). More
adaptation options are available to address water supply deficits than
flooding and water quality concerns (medium confidence). Ecosystems
are under increasing stress from rising temperatures, CO2 concentrations,
and sea levels, with particular vulnerability to climate extremes (very
high confidence). In many cases, climate stresses exacerbate other
anthropogenic influences on ecosystems, including land use changes,
non-native species, and pollution. Projected increases in temperature,
reductions in precipitation in some regions, and increased frequency
of extreme events would result in net productivity declines in major

North  American  crops  by  the  end  of  the  21st  century  without
adaptation, although some regions, particularly in the north, may benefit.
Adaptation, often with mitigation co-benefits, could offset projected
negative yield impacts for many crops at 2°C global mean temperature
increase  above  preindustrial  levels,  with  reduced  effectiveness  of
adaptation at 4°C (high confidence). Although larger urban centers
would  have  higher  adaptive  capacities,  high  population  density,
inadequate infrastructures, lack of institutional capacity, and degraded
natural environments increase future climate risks from heat waves,
droughts, storms, and sea level rise (medium evidence, high agreement).
Future  risks  from  climate  extremes  can  be  reduced,  for  example
through  targeted  and  sustainable  air  conditioning,  more  effective

• Signiﬁcant potential exists for adaptation in islands, but additional external

Distributional shift in ﬁsh and invertebrate

Reduced biodiversity, ﬁsheries abundance,

TS

[5.4, 6.4, 30.3, 30.5, 30.6, Tables 6-6 and 
30-3, Box CC-CR]

• Evolutionary adaptation potential of ﬁsh and invertebrate species to warming 
is limited as indicated by their changes in distribution to maintain temperatures. 
• Human adaptation options: Large-scale translocation of industrial ﬁshing 
activities following the regional decreases (low latitude) vs. possibly transient 
increases (high latitude) in catch potential; Flexible management that can react 
to variability and change; Improvement of ﬁsh resilience to thermal stress by 
reducing other stressors such as pollution and eutrophication; Expansion of 
sustainable aquaculture and the development of alternative livelihoods in some 
regions.

• Evidence of rapid evolution by corals is very limited. Some corals may migrate 
to higher latitudes, but entire reef systems are not expected to be able to track 
the high rates of temperature shifts. 
• Human adaptation options are limited to reducing other stresses, mainly by 
enhancing water quality, and limiting pressures from tourism and ﬁshing. These 
options will delay human impacts of climate change by a few decades, but their 
efﬁcacy will be severely reduced as thermal stress increases.

Central  and  South America. Despite  improvements,  high  and
persistent  levels  of  poverty  in  most  countries  result  in  high
vulnerability to climate variability and change (high confidence).
Climate change impacts on agricultural productivity are expected to
exhibit large spatial variability, for example with sustained or increased
productivity  through  mid-century  in  southeast  South  America  and
decreases in productivity in the near term (by 2030) in Central America,
threatening food security of the poorest populations (medium confidence).
Reduced precipitation and increased evapotranspiration in semi-arid
regions will increase risks from water-supply shortages, affecting cities,
hydropower generation, and agriculture (high confidence). Ongoing
adaptation strategies include reduced mismatch between water supply
and demand, and water-management and coordination reforms (medium
confidence). Conversion of natural ecosystems, a driver of anthropogenic
climate change, is the main cause of biodiversity and ecosystem loss
(high  confidence).  Climate  change  is  expected  to  increase  rates  of
species extinction (medium confidence). In coastal and marine systems,
sea  level  rise  and  human  stressors  increase  risks  for  fish  stocks,
corals, mangroves, recreation and tourism, and control of diseases (high
confidence). Climate change will exacerbate future health risks given
regional population growth rates and vulnerabilities due to pollution,
food insecurity in poor regions, and existing health, water, sanitation,
and waste collection systems (medium confidence). [27.2, 27.3]

Polar Regions. Climate change and often-interconnected non-
climate-related  drivers,  including  environmental  changes,
demography, culture, and economic development, interact in the
Arctic  to  determine  physical,  biological,  and  socioeconomic
risks, with rates of change that may be faster than social systems
can  adapt  (high  confidence).  Thawing  permafrost  and  changing

precipitation patterns have the potential to affect infrastructure and
related  services,  with  particular  risks  for  residential  buildings,  for
example in Arctic cities and small rural settlements. Climate change will
especially  impact  Arctic  communities  that  have  narrowly  based
economies limiting adaptive choices. Increased Arctic navigability and
expanded land- and freshwater-based transportation networks will
increase economic opportunities. Impacts on the informal, subsistence-
based economy will include changing sea ice conditions that increase
the difficulty of hunting marine mammals. Polar bears have been and
will be affected by loss of annual ice over continental shelves, decreased
ice duration, and decreased ice thickness. Already, accelerated rates of
change in permafrost thaw, loss of coastal sea ice, sea level rise, and
increased intensity of weather extremes are forcing relocation of some
indigenous communities in Alaska (high confidence). In the Arctic and
Antarctic, some marine species will shift their ranges in response to
changing ocean and sea ice conditions (medium confidence). Climate
change will increase the vulnerability of terrestrial ecosystems to invasions
by non-indigenous species (high confidence). [6.3, 6.5, 28.2 to 28.4]

Small Islands. Small islands have high vulnerability to climatic
and non-climatic stressors (high confidence). Diverse physical and
human attributes and their sensitivity to climate-related drivers lead to
variable climate change risk profiles and adaptation from one island
region to another and among countries in the same region. Risks can
originate from transboundary interactions, for example associated with
existing and future invasive species and human health challenges. Sea
level rise poses one of the most widely recognized climate change
threats to low-lying coastal areas on islands and atolls. Projected sea
level rise at the end of the 21st century, superimposed on extreme-
sea-level events, presents severe coastal flooding and erosion risks for
low-lying coastal areas and atoll islands. Wave over-wash will degrade
groundwater resources. Coral reef ecosystem degradation associated
with increasing sea surface temperature and ocean acidification will

negatively  impact  island  communities  and  livelihoods,  given  the
dependence of island communities on coral reef ecosystems for coastal
protection, subsistence fisheries, and tourism. [29.3 to 29.5, 29.9, 30.5,
Figure 29-1, Table 29-3, Box CC-CR]

The Ocean. Warming will increase risks to ocean ecosystems
(high confidence). Coral reefs within coastal boundary systems, semi-
enclosed seas, and subtropical gyres are rapidly declining as a result of
local non-climatic stressors (i.e., coastal pollution, overexploitation) and
climate  change.  Projected  increases  in  mass  coral  bleaching  and
mortality will alter or eliminate ecosystems, increasing risks to coastal
livelihoods and food security (medium to high confidence). An analysis
of the CMIP5 ensemble projects loss of coral reefs from most sites
globally to be very likely by 2050 under mid to high rates of ocean
warming. Reducing non-climatic stressors represents an opportunity to
strengthen ecological resilience. The highly productive high-latitude
spring  bloom  systems  in  the  northeastern Atlantic  are  responding
to warming (medium evidence, high agreement), with the greatest
changes  being  observed  since  the  late  1970s  in  the  phenology,

distribution,  and  abundance  of  plankton  assemblages,  and  the
reorganization of fish assemblages, with a range of consequences for
fisheries (high confidence). Projected warming increases the likelihood
of greater thermal stratification in some regions, which can lead to
reduced O2 ventilation and encourage the formation of hypoxic zones,
especially in the Baltic and Black Seas (medium confidence). Changing
surface winds and waves, sea level, and storm intensity will increase
the vulnerability of ocean-based industries such as shipping, energy,
and mineral extraction. New opportunities as well as international
issues  over  access  to  resources  and  vulnerability  may  accompany
warming waters particularly at high latitudes. [5.3, 5.4, 6.4, 28.2, 28.3,
30.3, 30.5, 30.6, Table 30-1, Figures 30-4 and 30-10, Boxes 6-1, CC-CR,
and CC-MB]

Understanding of extreme events and their interactions with
climate change is particularly important for managing risks in a
regional context. Table TS.6 provides a summary of observed and
projected  trends  in  some  types  of  temperature  and  precipitation
extremes.

C: MANAGING FUTURE RISKS
AND BUILDING RESILIENCE

Managing the risks of climate change involves adaptation and mitigation
decisions  with  implications  for  future  generations,  economies,  and
environments.  Figure TS.12  provides  an  overview  of  responses  for
addressing risk related to climate change. 

Starting with principles for effective adaptation, this section evaluates
the ways that interlinked human and natural systems can build resilience
through  adaptation,  mitigation,  and  sustainable  development.  It
describes understanding of climate-resilient pathways, of incremental
versus transformational changes, and of limits to adaptation, and it
considers  co-benefits,  synergies,  and  trade-offs  among  mitigation,
adaptation, and development.

C-1. Principles for Effective Adaptation

The report assesses a wide variety of approaches for reducing and
managing risks and building resilience. Strategies and approaches to
climate change adaptation include efforts to decrease vulnerability or
exposure and/or increase resilience or adaptive capacity. Mitigation is
assessed in the WGIII AR5. Specific examples of responses to climate
change are presented in Table TS.7.

Adaptation  is  place-  and  context-specific,  with  no  single
approach for reducing risks appropriate across all settings (high
confidence). Effective risk reduction and adaptation strategies consider
the dynamics of vulnerability and exposure and their linkages with
socioeconomic processes, sustainable development, and climate change.
[2.1, 8.3, 8.4, 13.1, 13.3, 13.4, 15.2, 15.3, 15.5, 16.2, 16.3, 16.5, 17.2,
17.4, 19.6, 21.3, 22.4, 26.8, 26.9, 29.6, 29.8]

Adaptation  planning  and  implementation  can  be  enhanced
through complementary actions across levels, from individuals to
governments (high confidence). National governments can coordinate
adaptation efforts of local and subnational governments, for example
by protecting vulnerable groups, by supporting economic diversification,
and by providing information, policy and legal frameworks, and financial
support (robust evidence, high agreement). Local government and the
private sector are increasingly recognized as critical to progress in
adaptation, given their roles in scaling up adaptation of communities,
households, and civil society and in managing risk information and
financing (medium evidence, high agreement). [2.1 to 2.4, 3.6, 5.5, 8.3,
8.4, 9.3, 9.4, 14.2, 15.2, 15.3, 15.5, 16.2 to 16.5, 17.2, 17.3, 22.4, 24.4,
25.4, 26.8, 26.9, 30.7, Tables 21-1, 21-5, and 21-6, Box 16-2] 

A  first  step  towards  adaptation  to  future  climate  change  is
reducing vulnerability and exposure to present climate variability
(high confidence). Strategies include actions with co-benefits for
other  objectives.  Available  strategies  and  actions  can  increase
resilience across a range of possible future climates while helping to
improve human health, livelihoods, social and economic well-being, and
environmental quality. Examples of adaptation strategies that also
strengthen  livelihoods,  enhance  development,  and  reduce  poverty
include improved social protection, improved water and land governance,
enhanced water storage and services, greater involvement in planning,
and elevated attention to urban and peri-urban areas heavily affected
by migration of poor people. See Table TS.7. [3.6, 8.3, 9.4, 14.3, 15.2,
15.3, 17.2, 20.4, 20.6, 22.4, 24.4, 24.5, 25.4, 25.10, 27.3 to 27.5, 29.6,
Boxes 25-2 and 25-6] 

Adaptation  planning  and  implementation  at  all  levels  of
governance are contingent on societal values, objectives, and risk
perceptions (high confidence). Recognition of diverse interests,
circumstances,  social-cultural  contexts,  and  expectations  can

benefit decision-making processes. Awareness that climate change
may exceed the adaptive capacity of some people and ecosystems may
have ethical implications for mitigation decisions and investments.
Economic analysis of adaptation is moving away from a unique emphasis
on efficiency, market solutions, and benefit/cost analysis to include
consideration  of  non-monetary  and  non-market  measures,  risks,
inequities, behavioral biases, barriers and limits, and ancillary benefits
and costs. [2.2 to 2.4, 9.4, 12.3, 13.2, 15.2, 16.2 to 16.4, 16.6, 16.7,
17.2, 17.3, 21.3, 22.4, 24.4, 24.6, 25.4, 25.8, 26.9, 28.2, 28.4, Table
15-1, Boxes 16-1, 16-4, and 25-7]

Indigenous, local, and traditional knowledge systems and practices,
including indigenous peoples’ holistic view of community and
environment, are a major resource for adapting to climate change
(robust evidence, high agreement). Natural resource dependent
communities,  including  indigenous  peoples,  have  a  long  history  of
adapting to highly variable and changing social and ecological conditions.
But the salience of indigenous, local, and traditional knowledge will be
challenged by climate change impacts. Such forms of knowledge have
not been used consistently in existing adaptation efforts. Integrating such
forms of knowledge with existing practices increases the effectiveness
of adaptation. [9.4, 12.3, 15.2, 22.4, 24.4, 24.6, 25.8, 28.2, 28.4, Table
15-1]

Decision support is most effective when it is sensitive to context
and  the  diversity  of  decision  types,  decision  processes,  and
constituencies (robust evidence, high agreement). Organizations
bridging science and decision making, including climate services, play
an important role in the communication, transfer, and development of
climate-related knowledge, including translation, engagement, and
knowledge exchange (medium evidence, high agreement). [2.1 to 2.4,
8.4, 14.4, 16.2, 16.3, 16.5, 21.2, 21.3, 21.5, 22.4, Box 9-4]

Integration of adaptation into planning and decision making can
promote synergies with development and disaster risk reduction
(high  confidence).  Such  mainstreaming  embeds  climate-sensitive
thinking in existing and new institutions and organizations. Adaptation
can generate larger benefits when connected with development activities
and disaster risk reduction (medium confidence). [8.3, 9.3, 14.2, 14.6,
15.3, 15.4, 17.2, 20.2, 20.3, 22.4, 24.5, 29.6, Box CC-UR]

Existing and emerging economic instruments can foster adaptation
by providing incentives for anticipating and reducing impacts
(medium  confidence). Instruments include public–private finance
partnerships, loans, payments for environmental services, improved
resource pricing, charges and subsidies, norms and regulations, and risk
sharing and transfer mechanisms. Risk financing mechanisms in the public
and private sector, such as insurance and risk pools, can contribute to
increasing resilience, but without attention to major design challenges,
they can also provide disincentives, cause market failure, and decrease
equity. Governments often play key roles as regulators, providers, or
insurers of last resort. [10.7, 10.9, 13.3, 17.4, 17.5, Box 25-7]

Constraints  can  interact  to  impede  adaptation  planning  and
implementation  (high  confidence).  Common  constraints  on

implementation arise from the following: limited financial and human
resources; limited integration or coordination of governance; uncertainties
about  projected  impacts;  different  perceptions  of  risks;  competing
values; absence of key adaptation leaders and advocates; and limited
tools to monitor adaptation effectiveness. Another constraint includes
insufficient research, monitoring, and observation and the finance to
maintain them. Underestimating the complexity of adaptation as a
social  process  can  create  unrealistic  expectations  about  achieving
intended adaptation outcomes. [3.6, 4.4, 5.5, 8.4, 9.4, 13.2, 13.3, 14.2,
14.5, 15.2, 15.3, 15.5, 16.2, 16.3, 16.5, 17.2, 17.3, 22.4, 23.7, 24.5, 25.4,
25.10, 26.8, 26.9, 30.6, Table 16-3, Boxes 16-1 and 16-3]

Poor planning, overemphasizing short-term outcomes, or failing
to sufficiently anticipate consequences can result in maladaptation
(medium evidence, high agreement). Maladaptation can increase
the vulnerability or exposure of the target group in the future, or the
vulnerability  of  other  people,  places,  or  sectors.  Narrow  focus  on
quantifiable costs and benefits can bias decisions against the poor,
against ecosystems, and against those in the future whose values can
be excluded or are understated. Some near-term responses to increasing
risks  related  to  climate  change  may  also  limit  future  choices.  For
example, enhanced protection of exposed assets can lock in dependence
on further protection measures. [5.5, 8.4, 14.6, 15.5, 16.3, 17.2, 17.3,
20.2, 22.4, 24.4, 25.10, 26.8, Table 14-4, Box 25-1]

Limited evidence indicates a gap between global adaptation
needs and funds available for adaptation (medium confidence).
There is a need for a better assessment of global adaptation costs,
funding, and investment. Studies estimating the global cost of adaptation
are characterized by shortcomings in data, methods, and coverage (high
confidence). [14.2, 17.4, Tables 17-2 and 17-3]

C-2. Climate-resilient Pathways and Transformation

Climate-resilient pathways are sustainable-development trajectories
that combine adaptation and mitigation to reduce climate change and
its impacts. They include iterative processes to ensure that effective risk
management can be implemented and sustained. See Figure TS.13. [2.5,
20.3, 20.4]

Prospects  for  climate-resilient  pathways  for  sustainable
development  are  related  fundamentally  to  what  the  world
accomplishes with climate-change mitigation (high confidence).
Since mitigation reduces the rate as well as the magnitude of warming,
it also increases the time available for adaptation to a particular level
of climate change, potentially by several decades. Delaying mitigation
actions may reduce options for climate-resilient pathways in the future.
[1.1, 19.7, 20.2, 20.3, 20.6, Figure 1-5]

Greater rates and magnitude of climate change increase the
likelihood of exceeding adaptation limits (high confidence). See
Box TS.8. Limits to adaptation occur when adaptive actions to avoid
intolerable risks for an actor’s objectives or for the needs of a system
are not possible or are not currently available. Value-based judgments

cultural factors. (B) Opportunity space [Sections A-2, A-3, B-2, C-1, and C-2] refers to decision points and pathways that lead to a range of (C) possible futures [Sections C and B-3] with 
differing levels of resilience and risk. (D) Decision points result in actions or failures-to-act throughout the opportunity space, and together they constitute the process of managing or failing

failure to learn and use knowledge, and other actions that lower resilience; and they can be irreversible in terms of possible futures. [Figure 1-5]

of what constitutes an intolerable risk may differ. Limits to adaptation
emerge from the interaction among climate change and biophysical
and/or socioeconomic constraints. Opportunities to take advantage of
positive synergies between adaptation and mitigation may decrease
with time, particularly if limits to adaptation are exceeded. In some parts
of the world, insufficient responses to emerging impacts are already
eroding the basis for sustainable development. [1.1, 11.8, 13.4, 16.2 to
16.7, 17.2, 20.2, 20.3, 20.5, 20.6, 25.10, 26.5, Boxes 16-1, 16-3, and
16-4]

Transformations in economic, social, technological, and political
decisions  and  actions  can  enable  climate-resilient  pathways
(high confidence). Specific examples are presented in Table TS.7. See
also Box TS.8. Strategies and actions can be pursued now that will move
towards climate-resilient pathways for sustainable development, while
at the same time helping to improve livelihoods, social and economic

well-being, and responsible environmental management. Transformations
in response to climate change may involve, for example, introduction
of new technologies or practices, formation of new structures or systems
of governance, or shifts in the types or locations of activities. The scale
and magnitude of transformational adaptations depend on mitigation
and  on  development  processes. Transformational  adaptation  is  an
important consideration for decisions involving long life- or lead-times,
and it can be a response to adaptation limits. At the national level,
transformation is considered most effective when it reflects a country’s
own visions and approaches to achieving sustainable development in
accordance with its national circumstances and priorities. Transformations
to  sustainability  are  considered  to  benefit  from  iterative  learning,
deliberative processes, and innovation. Societal debates about many
aspects of transformation may place new and increased demands on
governance structures. [1.1, 2.1, 2.5, 8.4, 14.1, 14.3, 16.2 to 16.7, 20.5,

Examples of Co-benefits, Synergies, and Trade-offs among
Adaptation, Mitigation, and Sustainable Development

•

Significant co-benefits, synergies, and trade-offs exist between
mitigation  and  adaptation  and  among  different  adaptation
responses; interactions occur both within and across regions
(very high confidence). Illustrative examples include the following.
Increasing efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change imply an
•
increasing complexity of interactions, particularly at the intersections
among  water,  energy,  land  use,  and  biodiversity,  but  tools  to
understand and manage these interactions remain limited (very
high  confidence).  See  Box  TS.9.  Widespread  transformation  of
terrestrial ecosystems in order to mitigate climate change, such as
carbon sequestration through planting fast-growing tree species
into  ecosystems  where  they  did  not  previously  occur,  or  the

conversion  of  previously  uncultivated  or  non-degraded  land  to
bioenergy plantations, can lead to negative impacts on ecosystems
and biodiversity (high confidence). [3.7, 4.2 to 4.4, 22.6, 24.6, 25.7,
25.9, 27.3, Boxes 25-10 and CC-WE]
Climate policies such as increasing energy supply from renewable
resources, encouraging bioenergy crop cultivation, or facilitating
payments under REDD+ will affect some rural areas both positively
(e.g., increasing employment opportunities) and negatively (e.g.,
land use changes, increasing scarcity of natural capital) (medium
confidence). These  secondary  impacts,  and  trade-offs  between
mitigation and adaptation in rural areas, have implications for
governance, including benefits of promoting participation of rural
stakeholders. Mitigation policies with social co-benefits expected
in their design, such as CDM and REDD+, have had limited or no
effect in terms of poverty alleviation and sustainable development

TS

Box TS.8 | Adaptation Limits and Transformation

Adaptation can expand the capacity of natural and human systems to cope with a changing climate. Risk-based decision making can
be used to assess potential limits to adaptation. Limits to adaptation occur when adaptive actions to avoid intolerable risks for an
actor’s objectives or for the needs of a system are not possible or are not currently available. Limits to adaptation are context-speciﬁc
and closely linked to cultural norms and societal values. Value-based judgments of what constitutes an intolerable risk may differ
among actors, but understandings of limits to adaptation can be informed by historical experiences, or by anticipation of impacts,
vulnerability, and adaptation associated with different scenarios of climate change. The greater the magnitude or rate of climate
change, the greater the likelihood that adaptation will encounter limits. [16.2 to 16.4, 20.5, 20.6, 22.4, 25.4, 25.10, Box 16-2]

Limits to adaptation may be inﬂuenced by the subjective values of societal actors, which can affect both the perceived need for
adaptation and the perceived appropriateness of speciﬁc policies and measures. While limits imply that intolerable risks and the
increased potential for losses and damages can no longer be avoided, the dynamics of social and ecological systems mean that there
are both “soft” and “hard” limits to adaptation. For “soft” limits, there are opportunities in the future to alter limits and reduce risks,
for example, through the emergence of new technologies or changes in laws, institutions, or values. In contrast, “hard” limits are
those where there are no reasonable prospects for avoiding intolerable risks. Recent studies on tipping points, key vulnerabilities, and
planetary boundaries provide some insights on the behavior of complex systems. [16.2 to 16.7, 25.10]

In cases where the limits to adaptation have been surpassed, losses and damage may increase and the objectives of some actors
may no longer be achievable. There may be a need for transformational adaptation to change fundamental attributes of a system in
response to actual or expected impacts of climate change. It may involve adaptations at a greater scale or intensity than previously
experienced, adaptations that are new to a region or system, or adaptations that transform places or lead to a shift in the types or
locations of activities. [16.2 to 16.4, 20.3, 20.5, 22.4, 25.10, Boxes 25-1 and 25-9]

The existence of limits to adaptation suggests transformational change may be a requirement for sustainable development in a
changing climate—that is, not only for adapting to the impacts of climate change, but for altering the systems and structures,
economic and social relations, and beliefs and behaviors that contribute to climate change and social vulnerability. However, just as
there are ethical implications associated with some adaptation options, there are also legitimate concerns about the equity and ethical
dimensions of transformation. Societal debates over risks from forced and reactive transformations as opposed to deliberate transitions
to sustainability may place new and increased demands on governance structures at multiple levels to reconcile conﬂicting goals and
visions for the future. [1.1, 16.2 to 16.7, 20.5, 25.10]

Technical Summary

(medium confidence). Mitigation efforts focused on land acquisition
for biofuel production show preliminary negative impacts for the
poor in many developing countries, and particularly for indigenous
people and (women) smallholders. [9.3, 13.3, 22.6]

• Mangrove, seagrass, and salt marsh ecosystems offer important
carbon storage and sequestration opportunities (limited evidence,
medium agreement), in addition to ecosystem goods and services

such as protection against coastal erosion and storm damage and
maintenance of habitats for fisheries species. For ocean-related
mitigation  and  adaptation  in  the  context  of  anthropogenic
ocean warming and acidification, international frameworks offer
opportunities to solve problems collectively, for example, managing
fisheries across national borders and responding to extreme events.

TS

Beneﬁ ts of green infrastructure and roofs can include reduction of storm water runoff and the urban heat island effect, improved energy performance of buildings, 
reduced noise and air pollution, health improvements, better amenity value, increased property values, improved biodiversity, and inward investment. Trade-offs can 
result between higher urban density to improve energy efﬁ ciency and open space for green infrastructure. [8.3.3, 11.7.4, 23.7.4, 24.6, Tables 11-3 and 25-5]

Examples with 
interactions

London: The Green Grid for East London seeks to create interlinked and multi-purpose open spaces to support regeneration of the area. It aims to connect people and 
places, to absorb and store water, to cool the vicinity, and to provide a diverse mosaic of habitats for wildlife. [8.3.3]

New York: In preparation for more intense storms, New York is using green infrastructure to capture rainwater before it can ﬂ ood the combined sewer system, 
implementing green roofs, and elevating boilers and other equipment above ground. [8.3.3, 26.3.3, 26.8.4]

Singapore: Singapore has used several anticipatory plans and projects to enhance green infrastructure, including its Streetscape Greenery Master Plan, constructed 
wetlands or drains, and community gardens. Under its Skyrise Greenery project, Singapore has provided subsidies and handbooks for rooftop and wall greening 
initiatives. [8.3.3]

Durban: Ecosystem-based adaptation is part of Durban’s climate change adaptation strategy. The approach seeks a more detailed understanding of the ecology of 
indigenous ecosystems and ways in which biodiversity and ecosystem services can reduce vulnerability of ecosystems and people. Examples include the Community 
Reforestation Programme, in which communities produce indigenous seedlings used in the planting and managing of restored forest areas. Development of ecosystem-
based adaptation in Durban has demonstrated needs for local knowledge and data and the beneﬁ ts of enhancing existing protected areas, land-use practices, and local 
initiatives contributing to jobs, business, and skill development. [8.3.3, Box 8-2]

Water management
Primary objective Water resource management given multiple stressors in a changing climate
Relevant sectors
Overview

Water use, energy production and use, biodiversity, carbon sequestration, biofuel production, food production

Water management in the context of climate change can encompass ecosystem-based approaches (e.g., watershed management or restoration, ﬂood regulation 
services, and reduction of erosion or siltation), supply-side approaches (e.g., dams, reservoirs, groundwater pumping and recharge, and water capture), and demand-
side approaches (e.g., increased use efﬁ ciency through water recycling, infrastructure upgrades, water-sensitive design, or more efﬁ cient allocation). Water may require 
signiﬁ cant amounts of energy for lifting, transport, distribution, and treatment. [3.7.2, 26.3, Tables 9-8 and 25-5, Boxes CC-EA and CC-WE]

Examples with 
interactions

New York: New York has a well-established program to protect and enhance its water supply through watershed protection. The Watershed Protection Program includes 
city ownership of land that remains undeveloped and coordination with landowners and communities to balance water-quality protection, local economic development, 
and improved wastewater treatment. The city government indicates it is the most cost-effective choice for New York given the costs and environmental impacts of a 
ﬁ ltration plant. [8.3.3, Box 26-3]

Cape Town: Facing challenges in ensuring future supplies, Cape Town responded by commissioning water management studies, which identiﬁ ed the need to incorporate 
climate change, as well as population and economic growth, in planning. During the 2005 drought, local authorities increased water tariffs to promote efﬁ cient water 
usage. Additional measures may include water restrictions, reuse of gray water, consumer education, or technological solutions such as low-ﬂ ow systems or dual ﬂ ush 
toilets. [8.3.3]

Capital cities in Australia: Many Australian capital cities are reducing reliance on catchment runoff and groundwater—water resources most sensitive to climate 
change and drought—and are diversifying supplies through desalination plants, water reuse including sewage and storm water recycling, and integrated water cycle 
management that considers climate change impacts. Demand is being reduced through water conservation and water-sensitive urban design and, during severe 
shortfalls, through implementation of restrictions. The water augmentation program in Melbourne includes a desalination plant. Trade-offs beyond energy intensiveness 
have been noted, such as damage to sites signiﬁ cant to aboriginal communities and higher water costs that will disproportionately affect poorer households. [14.6.2, 
Tables 25-6 and 25-7, Box 25-2]

Payment for environmental services and green ﬁ scal policies
Primary objective Management incorporating the costs of environmental externalities and the beneﬁ ts of ecosystem services
Relevant sectors
Overview

Biodiversity, ecosystem services

Payment for environmental services (PES) is a market-based approach that aims to protect natural areas, and associated livelihoods and environmental services, by 
developing ﬁ nancial incentives for preservation. Mitigation-focused PES schemes are common, and there is emerging evidence of adaptation-focused PES schemes. 
Successful PES approaches can be difﬁ cult to design for services that are hard to deﬁ ne or quantify. [17.5.2, 27.6.2]

Examples with 
interactions

Central and South America: A variety of PES schemes have been implemented in Central and South America. For example, national-level programs have operated 
in Costa Rica and Guatemala since 1997 and in Ecuador since 2008. Examples to date have shown that PES can ﬁ nance conservation, ecosystem restoration and 
reforestation, better land-use practices, mitigation, and more recently adaptation. Uniform payments for beneﬁ ciaries can be inefﬁ cient if, for example, recipients that 
promote greater environmental gains receive only the prevailing payment. [17.5.2, 27.3.2, 27.6.2, Table 27-8]

Brazil: Municipal funding in Brazil tied to ecosystem-management quality is a form of revenue transfer important to funding local adaptation actions. State 
governments collect a value-added tax redistributed among municipalities, and some states allocate revenues in part based on municipality area set aside for protection. 
This mechanism has helped improve environmental management and increased creation of protected areas. It beneﬁ ts relations between protected areas and 
surrounding inhabitants, as the areas can be perceived as opportunities for revenue generation rather than as obstacles to development. The approach builds on existing 
institutions and administrative procedures and thus has low transaction costs. [8.4.3, Box 8-4]

Overview

Renewable energy production and reduction of emissions

Biodiversity, agriculture, food security

Renewable energy production can require signiﬁ cant land areas and water resources, creating the potential for both positive and negative interactions between 
mitigation policies and land management. [4.4.4, 13.3.1, 19.3.2, 19.4.1, Box CC-WE]

Examples with 
interactions

Central and South America: Renewable resources, especially hydroelectric power and biofuels, account for substantial fractions of energy production in countries 
such as Brazil. Where bioenergy crops compete for land with food crops, substantial trade-offs can exist. Land-use change to produce bioenergy can affect food crops, 
biodiversity, and ecosystem services. Lignocellulosic feedstocks, such as sugarcane second-generation technologies, do not compete with food. [19.3.2, 27.3.6, 27.6.1, 
Table 27-6]

Australia and New Zealand: Mandatory renewable energy targets and incentives to increase carbon storage support increased biofuel production and increased 
biological carbon sequestration, with impacts on biodiversity depending on implementation. Beneﬁ ts can include reduced erosion, additional habitat, and enhanced 
connectivity, with risks or lost opportunities associated with large-scale monocultures especially if replacing more diverse landscapes. Large-scale land cover changes 
can affect catchment yields and regional climate in complex ways. New crops such as oil mallees or other eucalypts may provide multiple beneﬁ ts, especially in marginal 
areas, displacing fossil fuels or sequestering carbon, generating income for landholders (essential oils, charcoal, bio-char, biofuels), and providing ecosystem services.

Increasing resilience to extreme weather events in a changing climate

Infrastructure, energy use, spatial planning

Synergies and tradeoffs among sustainable development, adaptation, and mitigation occur in preparing for and responding to climate extremes and disasters. [13.2 to 
13.4, 20.3, 20.4]

Philippines: The Homeless People’s Federation of the Philippines developed responses following disasters, including community-rooted data gathering (e.g., assessing 
destruction and victims’ immediate needs); trust and contact building; savings support; community-organization registration; and identiﬁ cation of needed interventions 
(e.g., building-materials loans). Community surveys mapped inhabitants especially at risk in informal settlements, raising risk-awareness among the inhabitants and 
increasing community engagement in planning risk reduction and early warning systems. [8.3.2, 8.4.2]

London: Within London, built form and other dwelling characteristics can have a stronger inﬂ uence on indoor temperatures during heat waves than the urban heat 
island effect, and utilizing shade, thermal mass, ventilation control, and other passive-design features are effective adaptation options. Passive housing designs enhance 
natural ventilation and improve insulation, while also reducing household emissions. For example, in London the Beddington Zero Energy Development was designed to 
reduce or eliminate energy demand for heating, cooling, and ventilation for much of the year. [8.3.3, 11.7.4]

United States: In the United States, post-disaster funds for loss reduction are added to funds provided for disaster recovery. They can be used, for instance, to buy out 
properties that have experienced repetitive ﬂ ood losses and relocate residents to safer locations, to elevate structures, to assist communities with purchasing property 
and altering land-use patterns in ﬂ ood-prone areas, and to undertake other activities designed to lessen the impacts of future disasters. [14.3.3]

• Geoengineering approaches involving manipulation of the ocean
to ameliorate climate change (such as nutrient fertilization, binding
of CO2 by enhanced alkalinity, or direct CO2 injection into the deep
ocean) have very large environmental and associated socioeconomic
consequences (high confidence). Alternative methods focusing on
solar radiation management (SRM) leave ocean acidification unabated
as they cannot mitigate rising atmospheric CO2 emissions. [6.4] 
Some agricultural practices can reduce emissions and also increase
resilience  of  crops  to  temperature  and  rainfall  variability  (high
confidence). [23.8, Table 25-7]

• Many solutions for reducing energy and water consumption in
urban areas with co-benefits for climate change adaptation (e.g.,
greening cities and recycling water) are already being implemented
(high confidence). Transport systems promoting active transport
and reduced motorized-vehicle use can improve air quality and
increase physical activity (medium confidence). [11.9, 23.8, 24.4,
26.3, 26.8, Boxes 25-2 and 25-9]
Improved energy efficiency and cleaner energy sources can lead to
reduced emissions of health-damaging climate-altering air pollutants
(very high confidence). [11.9, 23.8]
In Africa, experience in implementing integrated adaptation–mitigation
responses that leverage developmental benefits encompasses some
participation of farmers and local communities in carbon offset
systems and increased use of agroforestry and farmer-assisted tree
regeneration (high confidence). [22.4, 22.6]
In Asia, development of sustainable cities with fewer fossil-fuel-

confidence). [24.4 to 24.7]
In Australasia, transboundary effects from climate change impacts
and responses outside Australasia have the potential to outweigh
some of the direct impacts within the region, particularly economic
impacts on trade-intensive sectors such as agriculture (medium
confidence) and tourism (limited evidence, high agreement), but they
remain among the least-explored issues. [25.7, 25.9, Box 25-10]
In  North  America,  policies  addressing  local  concerns  (e.g.,  air
pollution, housing for the poor, declines in agricultural production)
can be adapted at low or no cost to fulfill adaptation, mitigation,
and sustainability goals (medium confidence). [26.9]
In Central and South America, biomass-based renewable energy can
impact land use change and deforestation, and could be affected by
climate change (medium confidence). The expansion of sugarcane,
soy, and oil palm may have some effect on land use, leading to
deforestation in parts of the Amazon and Central America, among
other sub-regions, and to loss of employment in some countries.
[27.3]
For small islands, energy supply and use, tourism infrastructure and
activities, and coastal wetlands offer opportunities for adaptation–
mitigation synergies (medium confidence). [29.6 to 29.8]

Technical Summary

Box TS.9 | The Water–Energy–Food Nexus

Water, energy, and food/feed/ﬁber are linked through numerous interactive pathways affected by a changing climate (Box TS.9
Figure 1). [Box CC-WE] The depth and intensity of those linkages vary enormously among countries, regions, and production systems.
Many energy sources require signiﬁcant amounts of water and produce a large quantity of wastewater that requires energy for
treatment. [3.7, 7.3, 10.2, 10.3, 22.3, 25.7, Box CC-WE] Food production, refrigeration, transport, and processing also require both
energy and water. A major link between food and energy as related to climate change is the competition of bioenergy and food
production for land and water, and the sensitivity of precipitation, temperature, and crop yields to climate change (robust evidence,
high agreement). [7.3, Boxes 25-10 and CC-WE]

Nutritionally appropriate low-meat 
diet or low-water-consuming 
vegetarian diet generally reduces 
water and energy demand as well as 
GHG emissions per person.

Use of agricultural, livestock, and food 
waste may reduce conventional energy 
use and GHG emissions.

Climate change tends to increase 
energy demand for cooling as well as 
water demand.

Box TS.9 Figure 1 | The water–energy–food nexus as related to climate change, with implications for both adaptation and mitigation strategies. [Figure WE-1, Box CC-WE]

Most energy production methods require signiﬁcant amounts of water, either directly (e.g., crop-based energy sources and
hydropower) or indirectly (e.g., cooling for thermal energy sources or other operations) (robust evidence, high agreement). [10.2,
10.3, 25.7, Box CC-WE] Water is required for mining, processing, and residue disposal of fossil fuels or their byproducts. [25.7] Water
for energy currently ranges from a few percent in most developing countries to more than 50% of freshwater withdrawals in some
developed countries, depending on the country. [Box CC-WE] Future water requirements will depend on electric demand growth, the
portfolio of generation technologies, and water management options (medium evidence, high agreement). Future water availability
for energy production will change due to climate change (robust evidence, high agreement). [3.4, 3.5, Box CC-WE]

Energy is also required to supply and treat water. Water may require signiﬁcant amounts of energy for lifting (especially as aquifers
continue to be depleted), transport, and distribution and for its treatment either to use it or to depollute it. Wastewater and even
excess rainfall in cities requires energy to be treated or disposed. Some non-conventional water sources (wastewater or seawater)
are often highly energy intensive. [Table 25-7, Box 25-2] Energy intensities per cubic meter of water vary by about a factor of 10
among different sources, for example, locally produced potable water from ground/surface water sources versus desalinated seawater.
[Boxes 25-2 and CC-WE] Groundwater is generally more energy intensive than surface water. [Box CC-WE]

Linkages among water, energy, food/feed/ﬁber, and climate are strongly related to land use and management, such as afforestation,
which can affect water as well as other ecosystem services, climate, and water cycles (robust evidence, high agreement). Land
degradation often reduces efﬁciency of water and energy use (e.g., resulting in higher fertilizer demand and surface runoff), and
many of these interactions can compromise food security. On the other hand, afforestation activities to sequester carbon have
important co-beneﬁts of reducing soil erosion and providing additional (even if only temporary) habitat, but may reduce renewable
water resources. [3.7, 4.4, Boxes 25-10 and CC-WE]

Consideration of the interlinkages of energy, food/feed/ﬁber, water, land use, and climate change has implications for security of
supplies of energy, food, and water; adaptation and mitigation pathways; air pollution reduction; and health and economic impacts.
This nexus is increasingly recognized as critical to effective climate-resilient-pathway decision making (medium evidence, high
agreement), although tools to support local- and regional-scale assessments and decision support remain very limited.

Working Group II Frequently Asked Questions

These FAQs provide an entry point to the approach and scientific findings
of the Working Group II contribution to the Fifth Assessment Report.
For summary of the scientific findings, see the Summary for Policymakers
(SPM) and Technical Summary (TS). These FAQs, presented in clear and
accessible language, do not reflect formal assessment of the degree of
certainty in conclusions, and they do not include calibrated uncertainty
language presented in the SPM, TS, and underlying chapters. The sources
of the relevant assessment in the report are noted by chapter numbers
in square brackets.

FAQ 1: Are risks of climate change mostly due to changes in
extremes, changes in average climate, or both?
[Chapters 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 18, 19, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26,
27, 28, 29, 30; TS]
People and ecosystems across the world experience climate in many
different ways, but weather and climate extremes strongly influence
losses  and  disruptions.  Average  climate  conditions  are  important.
They provide a starting point for understanding what grows where and
for  informing  decisions  about  tourist  destinations,  other  business
opportunities, and crops to plant. But the impacts of a change in average
conditions often occur as a result of changes in the frequency, intensity,
or duration of extreme weather and climate events. It is the extremes
that place excessive and often unexpected demands on systems poorly
equipped to deal with those extremes. For example, wet conditions lead
to flooding when storm drains and other infrastructure for handling
excess water are overwhelmed. Buildings fail when wind speeds exceed
design standards. For many kinds of disruption, from crop failure caused
by drought to sickness and death from heat waves, the main risks are
in the extremes, with changes in average conditions representing a
climate with altered timing, intensity, and types of extremes.

FAQ 2: How much can we say about what society will be like in
the future, in order to plan for climate change impacts?
[Chapters 1, 2, 14, 15, 16, 17, 20, and 21; TS]
Overall characteristics of societies and economies, such as population
size,  economic  activity,  and  land  use,  are  highly  dynamic.  On  the
scale of just 1 or 2 decades, and sometimes in less time than that,
technological revolutions, political movements, or singular events can
shape  the  course  of  history  in  unpredictable  ways. To  understand
potential  impacts  of  climate  change  for  societies  and  ecosystems,
scientists use scenarios to explore implications of a range of possible
futures. Scenarios are not predictions of what will happen, but they can
be useful tools for researching a wide range of “what if” questions
about what the world might be like in the future. They can be used to
study future emissions of greenhouse gases and climate change. They
can also be used to explore the ways climate-change impacts depend
on  changes  in  society,  such  as  economic  or  population  growth  or
progress in controlling diseases. Scenarios of possible decisions and
policies can be used to explore the solution space for reducing greenhouse
gas emissions and preparing for a changing climate. Scenario analysis
creates a foundation for understanding risks of climate change for
people, ecosystems, and economies across a range of possible futures.
It  provides  important  tools  for  smart  decision  making  when  both
uncertainties and consequences are large.

FAQ 3: Why is climate change a particularly difficult challenge
for managing risk?
[Chapters 1, 2, 16, 17, 19, 20, 21, and 25; TS]
Risk management is easier for nations, companies, and even individuals
when the likelihood and consequences of possible events are readily
understood. Risk management becomes much more challenging when
the stakes are higher or when uncertainty is greater. As the WGII AR5
demonstrates, we know a great deal about the impacts of climate
change that have already occurred, and we understand a great deal
about expected impacts in the future. But many uncertainties remain,
and will persist. In particular, future greenhouse gas emissions depend
on societal choices, policies, and technology advancements not yet
made, and climate-change impacts depend on both the amount of
climate change that occurs and the effectiveness of development in
reducing  exposure  and  vulnerability. The  real  challenge  of  dealing
effectively with climate change is recognizing the value of wise and
timely decisions in a setting where complete knowledge is impossible.
This is the essence of risk management. 

FAQ 4: What are the timeframes for mitigation and adaptation
benefits?
[Chapters 1, 2, 16, 19, 20, and 21; TS]
Adaptation can reduce damage from impacts that cannot be avoided.
Mitigation strategies can decrease the amount of climate change that
occurs,  as  summarized  in  the WGIII AR5.  But  the  consequences  of
investments in mitigation emerge over time. The constraints of existing
infrastructure, limited deployment of many clean technologies, and the
legitimate aspirations for economic growth around the world all tend to
slow the deviation from established trends in greenhouse gas emissions.
Over the next few decades, the climate change we experience will be
determined primarily by the combination of past actions and current
trends. The near-term is thus an era where short-term risk reduction
comes from adapting to the changes already underway. Investments in
mitigation during both the near-term and the longer-term do, however,
have substantial leverage on the magnitude of climate change in the
latter decades of the century, making the second half of the 21st century
and beyond an era of climate options. Adaptation will still be important
during the era of climate options, but with opportunities and needs that
will depend on many aspects of climate change and development policy,
both in the near term and in the long term.

FAQ 5: Can science identify thresholds beyond which climate
change is dangerous?
[Chapters 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, and 25; TS]
Human activities are changing the climate. Climate-change impacts are
already widespread and consequential. But while science can quantify
climate change risks in a technical sense, based on the probability,
magnitude, and nature of the potential consequences of climate change,
determining what is dangerous is ultimately a judgment that depends
on values and objectives. For example, individuals will value the present
versus the future differently and will bring personal worldviews on the
importance of assets like biodiversity, culture, and aesthetics. Values
also  influence  judgments  about  the  relative  importance  of  global
economic growth versus assuring the well-being of the most vulnerable
among us. Judgments about dangerousness can depend on the extent
to which one’s livelihood, community, and family are directly exposed
and vulnerable to climate change. An individual or community displaced

by climate change might legitimately consider that specific impact
dangerous, even though that single impact might not cross the global
threshold of dangerousness. Scientific assessment of risk can provide
an important starting point for such value judgments about the danger
of climate change.

FAQ 6: Are we seeing impacts of recent climate change?
[Chapters 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 11, 13, 18, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, and
30; SPM]
Yes, there is strong evidence of impacts of recent observed climate
change on physical, biological, and human systems. Many regions have
experienced  warming  trends  and  more  frequent  high-temperature
extremes. Rising temperatures are associated with decreased snowpack,
and many ecosystems are experiencing climate-induced shifts in the
activity, range, or abundance of the species that inhabit them. Oceans
are also displaying changes in physical and chemical properties that, in
turn, are affecting coastal and marine ecosystems such as coral reefs,
and other oceanic organisms such as mollusks, crustaceans, fishes, and
zooplankton.  Crop  production  and  fishery  stocks  are  sensitive  to
changes in temperature. Climate change impacts are leading to shifts
in crop yields, decreasing yields overall and sometimes increasing them
in temperate and higher latitudes, and catch potential of fisheries is
increasing in some regions but decreasing in others. Some indigenous
communities are changing seasonal migration and hunting patterns to
adapt to changes in temperature. 

FAQ 7: Are the future impacts of climate change only negative?
Might there be positive impacts as well?
[Chapters 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 19, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27,
and 30]
Overall, the report identifies many more negative impacts than positive
impacts projected for the future, especially for high magnitudes and
rates of climate change. Climate change will, however, have different
impacts on people around the world and those effects will vary not only
by region but over time, depending on the rate and magnitude of climate
change. For example, many countries will face increased challenges for
economic development, increased risks from some diseases, or degraded
ecosystems, but some countries will probably have increased opportunities
for economic development, reduced instances of some diseases, or
expanded areas of productive land. Crop yield changes will vary with
geography and by latitude. Patterns of potential catch for fisheries are
changing globally as well, with both positive and negative consequences.
Availability of resources such as usable water will also depend on
changing rates of precipitation, with decreased availability in many
places but possible increases in runoff and groundwater recharge in
some regions like the high latitudes and wet tropics. 

FAQ 8: What communities are most vulnerable to the impacts
of climate change?
[Chapters 8, 9, 12, 13, 19, 22, 23, 26, 27, 29, and Box CC-GC]
Every society is vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, but the
nature of that vulnerability varies across regions and communities, over
time,  and  depends  on  unique  socioeconomic  and  other  conditions.
Poorer communities tend to be more vulnerable to loss of health and
life, while wealthier communities usually have more economic assets
at  risk.  Regions  affected  by  violence  or  governance  failure  can  be
particularly  vulnerable  to  climate  change  impacts.  Development

94

challenges,  such  as  gender  inequality  and  low  levels  of  education,
and other differences among communities in age, race and ethnicity,
socioeconomic status, and governance can influence vulnerability to
climate change impacts in complex ways. 

FAQ 9: Does climate change cause violent conflicts?
[Chapters 12, 19]
Some factors that increase risks from violent conflicts and civil wars are
sensitive to climate change. For example, there is growing evidence
that factors like low per capita incomes, economic contraction, and
inconsistent state institutions are associated with the incidence of civil
wars, and also seem to be sensitive to climate change. Climate-change
policies, particularly those associated with changing rights to resources,
can also increase risks from violent conflict. While statistical studies
document a relationship between climate variability and conflict, there
remains much disagreement about whether climate change directly
causes violent conflicts. 

FAQ 10: How are adaptation, mitigation, and sustainable
development connected?
[Chapters 1, 2, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 17, 20, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, and 29]
Mitigation has the potential to reduce climate change impacts, and
adaptation can reduce the damage of those impacts. Together, both
approaches can contribute to the development of societies that are
more  resilient  to  the  threat  of  climate  change  and  therefore  more
sustainable. Studies indicate that interactions between adaptation and
mitigation  responses  have  both  potential  synergies  and  tradeoffs
that vary according to context. Adaptation responses may increase
greenhouse gas emissions (e.g., increased fossil-based air conditioning
in  response  to  higher  temperatures),  and  mitigation  may  impede
adaptation (e.g., increased use of land for bioenergy crop production
negatively impacting ecosystems). There are growing examples of co-
benefits of mitigation and development policies, like those which can
potentially reduce local emissions of health-damaging and climate-
altering air pollutants from energy systems. It is clear that adaptation,
mitigation, and sustainable development will be connected in the future. 

FAQ 11: Why is it difficult to be sure of the role of climate
change in observed effects on people and ecosystems?
[Chapter 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 11, 12, 13, 18, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28,
29, and 30]
Climate change is one of many factors impacting the Earth’s complex
human societies and natural ecosystems. In some cases the effect of
climate change has a unique pattern in space or time, providing a
fingerprint  for  identification.  In  others,  potential  effects  of  climate
change are thoroughly mixed with effects of land use change, economic
development, changes in technology, or other processes. Trends in human
activities, health, and society often have many simultaneous causes,
making it especially challenging to isolate the role of climate change. 
      Much climate-related damage results from extreme weather events
and could be affected by changes in the frequency and intensity of these
events due to climate change. The most damaging events are rare, and
the level of damage depends on context. It can therefore be challenging
to build statistical confidence in observed trends, especially over short
time periods. Despite this, many climate change impacts on the physical
environment and ecosystems have been identified, and increasing numbers
of impacts have been found in human systems as well.
