Foreword

Production concentrates in big cities, leading provinces, and wealthy nations. Half the world’s 
production ﬁ ts onto 1.5 percent of its land. Cairo produces more than half of Egypt’s GDP, 
using just 0.5 percent of its area. Brazil’s three south-central states comprise 15 percent of 
its land, but more than half its production. And North America, the European Union, and 
Japan—with fewer than a billion people—account for three-quarters of the world’s wealth. 
But economic concentration leaves out some populations. In Brazil, China, and India, 
for example, lagging states have poverty rates more than twice those in dynamic states. 
More than two-thirds of the developing world’s poor live in villages. A billion people, liv-
ing in the poorest and most isolated nations, mostly in Sub-Saharan Africa and South and 
Central Asia, survive on less than 2 percent of the world’s wealth. 

These geographically disadvantaged people cope every day with the reality that develop-
ment does not bring economic prosperity everywhere at once; markets favor some places 
over others. But dispersing production more broadly does not necessarily foster prosperity. 
Economically successful nations both facilitate the concentration of production and insti-
tute policies that make people’s living standards—in terms of nutrition, education, health, 
and sanitation—more uniform across space. Getting the beneﬁ ts of both economic concen-
tration and social convergence requires policy actions aimed at economic integration. 

Integration should begin with institutions that ensure access to basic services such as 
primary education, primary health care, adequate sanitation, and clean drinking water for 
everyone. As integration becomes more difﬁ cult, adaptive policies should include roads, rail-
ways, airports, harbors, and communication systems that facilitate the movement of goods, 
services, people, and ideas locally, nationally, and internationally. For places where integration 
is hardest, for social or political reasons, the response should be commensurately comprehen-
sive, with institutions that unite, infrastructure that connects, and interventions that target, 
such as slum upgrading programs or incentives for producers to locate in certain areas. 

Using these principles, World Development Report 2009, the 31st in the series, reframes 
the policy debates on urbanization, territorial development, and regional integration. The 
report analyzes the early experience of developed countries and draws practical implications 
for urbanization policies in today’s developing countries. For the poorest countries in Africa 
and Asia that are landlocked or otherwise isolated from world markets, the Report discusses 
promising approaches to regional integration that combine institutional cooperation, shared 
infrastructure, and special incentives. In growing middle-income economies, general pros-
perity can camouﬂ age areas of persistent poverty. For such countries, the Report outlines 
strategies to foster domestic integration and help the poor in the least fortunate places. 

I expect that Reshaping Economic Geography will stimulate a much-needed discussion 
on the desirability of “balanced growth,” which has proved elusive. And by informing 
some important policy debates, it will point the way toward more inclusive and sustain-
able development.

Data notes
The countries included in regional and income groupings in this Report are listed in the 
Classiﬁ cation of Economies table at the beginning of the Selected World Development 
Indicators. Income classiﬁ cations are based on gross national income (GNP) per capita; 
thresholds for income classiﬁ cations in this edition may be found in the Introduction to 
Selected World Development Indicators. Group averages reported in the ﬁ gures and tables 
are unweighted averages of the countries in the group, unless noted to the contrary.

The use of the word countries to refer to economies implies no judgment by the World 
Bank about the legal or other status of a territory. The term developing countries includes 
low- and middle-income economies and thus may include economies in transition from 
central planning, as a matter of convenience. The terms industrialized countries or devel-
oped countries may be used as a matter of convenience to denote high-income economies. 
Dollar ﬁ gures are current U.S. dollars, unless otherwise speciﬁ ed. Billion means 1,000 

million; trillion means 1,000 billion.

Geography in motion

The Report at a Glance—Density, Distance, 
and Division

Growing cities, ever more mobile people, and increasingly specialized products are integral to development. These changes have 
been most noticeable in North America, Western Europe, and Northeast Asia. But countries in East and South Asia and Eastern 
Europe are now experiencing changes that are similar in their scope and speed. World Development Report 2009: Reshaping Eco-
nomic Geography concludes that such transformations will remain essential for economic success in other parts of the developing 
world and should be encouraged.

Seeing development in 3-D
These transformations bring prosper-
ity,  but  they  do  not  happen  without 
risk and sacriﬁ ce. Look at three of the 
world’s most prosperous places: 

•  The ﬁ rst is Tokyo, the largest city in 
the  world  with  35  million  people, 
a  quarter  of  Japan’s  population, 
packed into less than 4 percent of its 
land.

•  The second is the United States, the 
largest  economy  in  the  world  and 
perhaps also the most mobile, where 
about 35 million people change resi-
dences each year. 

•  The  third  is  Western  Europe,  the 
most  connected  continent  in  the 
world today, where countries trade 
about  35  percent  of  their  gross 
domestic product (GDP), more than 
half among neighbors. 

Visitors  to  Tokyo  can  see  people 
being  crushed  into  trains  by  profes-
sional  train-packers.  Millions  of  peo-
ple willingly subject themselves to the 
unpleasantness of such a crush. A map 
of Japan’s economic density shows why. 
Tokyo  generates  a  big  part  of  Japan’s 
wealth—to  get  a  share  of  it,  people 
have  to  live  close  by  (see  map  G0.1). 
The most striking feature of this map 
is density—the concentration of wealth 
in Tokyo and Osaka. 

In  the  United  States,  each  year  in 
the days before the Thanksgiving holi-
day, about 35 million people try to get 
back to their families and friends. It is 

the start of winter in some parts of the 
country,  so  ﬂ ights  often  are  canceled. 
But Americans put up with the pain of 
leaving friends and family, because eco-
nomic activity is concentrated in a few 
parts of the country (see map G0.2). To 
get a part of this wealth, you have to get 
closer to it. That is why 8 million Ameri-

cans change states every year, migrating 
to  reduce  their  distance  to  economic 
opportunity. The most striking feature 
of this map is distance.

Across  the  Atlantic,  in  Western 
Europe,  another  massive  movement 
takes  place  every  day—not  of  people 
but of products. One example is Airbus,

which makes parts of planes and assem-
bles them in France, Germany, Spain, and 
the United Kingdom as well as in other 
countries. Huge sections of aircraft are 
loaded onto ships and planes, as places 
specialize in making different parts and 
producing  them  in  scale.  Countries  in

a  region  that  was  divided  not  so  long 
ago now trade with former enemies to 
become an ever-more- integrated Euro-
pean  Union  (EU).  As  this  integration 
has increased, economic divisions have 
decreased,  making  specialization  and 
scale possible (see map G0.3). 

What is the payoff for this pain? A 
map  of  economic  geography,  which 
resizes the area of a country to reﬂ ect 
its GDP, shows the beneﬁ ts of big cit-
ies,  mobile  people,  and  connected 
countries. The United States, Western 
Europe, and Japan dominate the world’s 
economy (see map G0.4).

Cities,  migration,  and  trade  have 
been the main catalysts of progress in 
the developed world over the past two 
centuries. These stories are now being 
repeated in the developing world’s most 
dynamic economies. 

•  Mumbai  is  not  the  largest  city  in 
the world, but it is the most densely 
populated. And it keeps growing.

•  China is not the largest economy in 
the world, but it is the fastest growing 
and may be among the most mobile. 
•  Southeast Asia may not have formed 
a political union like Europe, but it 
trades parts of goods back and forth 
as the EU does.

People  risk  loss  of  life  or  limb  on 
Mumbai’s packed trains to take advan-

tage  of  economic  density.  Despite  the 
crush  among  commuters  and  in  such 
slums  as  Dharavi,  Mumbai’s  popula-
tion has doubled since the 1970s. Since 
the  1990s,  millions  of  Chinese  work-
ers have migrated to get closer to eco-
nomic opportunity concentrated along 
the coast. Just as Americans travel dur-
ing Thanksgiving, more than 200 mil-
lion people in China travel during the 
Chinese  New  Year.  Regional  produc-
tion  networks  in  East Asia  are  spread 
far wider than Airbus sites in Western 
Europe. East Asian countries may not 
trade  airplane  parts,  but  nations  that 
once were enemies now trade parts of 
cars and computers with the same fre-
quency and speed.

And  what  is  the  payoff?  We  can 
again  recognize  the  shapes  of  China, 
India,  and  Southeast  Asian  countries 
on  the  map  of  the  world’s  economic 
geography  (see  map  G0.4).  Contrast 
these  shapes  with  that  of  the  mighty 
continent of Africa, which shows up as 
a slender peninsula. 

The  World  Development  Report
argues that some places are doing well 
because they have promoted transfor-
mations along the three dimensions of 
economic geography:

•  Higher  densities,  as  seen  in  the 

growth of cities.

•  Shorter  distances,  as  workers  and 
businesses migrate closer to density.
•  Fewer  divisions,  as  countries  thin 
their  economic  borders  and  enter 
world markets to take advantage of 
scale and specialization.

The  United  States  and  Japan 
reshaped  their  economic  geography 
along these lines in the past. China is 
reshaping its economic geography now. 
This Report proposes that these will be 
the changes that will help developing 
nations  in  other  parts  of  the  world, 
most notably Africa. 

Unbalanced growth, inclusive 
development
That  is  what  this  World  Development 
Report  proposes,  and  the  Report  is

structured to bring out the message (see 
ﬁ gure G0.1). 

•  Part one describes the changes along 
the dimensions of density, distance, 
and  division—taking  up  each  in 
turn. It summarizes the experience 
of the past century or so. 

•  Part two analyzes the drivers of these 
transformations—the market forces 
of  agglomeration,  migration,  and 
specialization  and  trade.  It  distills 
the ﬁ ndings of policy research dur-
ing the past generation or so. 

•  Part three discusses the policy impli-
cations of the experience and analy-
sis in the ﬁ rst two parts. It provides 
a common framework for reframing 
three policy debates—on urbaniza-
tion, on lagging areas within coun-
tries,  and  on  regional  integration 
and globalization. 

The Report is structured and written 
in such a way that people interested in 
only one of these debates can read just 
some of it. That is, it can be read verti-
cally. The chapters on density, agglom-
eration,  and  urbanization  should 

interest all countries—small and large, 
low  income  and  middle  income.  The 
chapters  on  distance,  factor  mobility, 
and  regional  development  may  be  of 
most interest to larger middle-income 
countries. And the chapters on division, 
transport costs, and regional integration 
may be of most interest to low-income 
and smaller economies.

Four  spotlights  on  Geography  in 
Motion examine the interplay between 
market forces and government policies 
in  North  America,  Western  Europe, 
East Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa. By 
highlighting the interactions among the 
three dimensions, they also connect the 
Report’s different parts.

Seen another way, the Report exam-
ines the most important policy issues 
of economic geography, from local, to 
national, to international. Locally, the 
policy issue in areas such as Lagos state 
in southern Nigeria is how to manage 
urbanization.  Nationally,  the  policy 
issue in Nigeria is how to manage the 
disparities in resources and living stan-
dards in the north and the south. And 
internationally, the policy issue in West 

Africa is how to make a better economic 
union that beneﬁ ts both the landlocked 
and the coastal countries, the poorest 
and the more prosperous. 

As  the  geographic  scale  increases 
from local to national to international, 
the  speciﬁ c  policy  issue  changes.  But 
the underlying problem is the same—
some places do well, others do not. And 
it is difﬁ cult for anyone to accept this as 
inevitable. 

The  Report’s  main  message  is  that 
economic  growth  will  be  unbalanced. 
To  try  to  spread  out  economic  activ-
ity is to discourage it. But development 
can still be inclusive, in that even people 
who start their lives far away from eco-
nomic  opportunity  can  beneﬁ t  from 
the growing concentration of wealth in 
a  few  places.  The  way  to  get  both  the 
beneﬁ ts  of  uneven  growth  and  inclu-
sive development is through economic 
integration.

Economic integration—local, 
national, and international

nomic integration means. It means one

In  places  urbanizing  rapidly,  gov-
ernments  must  put  in  place,  in 
addition to institutions, connective 
infrastructure  so  that  the  beneﬁ ts 
of rising economic density are more 
widely  shared.  A  good  example  is 
Chongqing, China. 
In  places  where  urbanization  has 
advanced, in addition to institutions 
and  infrastructure,  targeted  inter-
ventions  may  be  necessary  to  deal 
with slums. But these interventions 
will not work unless institutions for 
land and basic services are reason-
ably  effective  and  transport  infra-
structure is in place. A good example 
is Bogotá, Colombia. 

Territorial development
The  principles  also  can  reshape  the 
debate on territorial or regional develop-
ment. The tools of geography can iden-
tify which places are poor—the lagging 
areas—and where most of the poor live. 
Often, the two are not the same, because 
the poor have the most reason to move 
from poor places. The Report discusses 
how governments can tailor policies to 

integrate  areas  within  nations,  while 
reducing poverty everywhere. 

Lagging  areas  have  one  thing  in 
common—they are economically dis-
tant from places doing well. But besides 
this, the economic geography of differ-
ent areas is not the same: 

(cid:129) 

(cid:129) 

In  some  countries,  such  as  China, 
lagging areas are sparsely populated. 
It  does  not  make  a  lot  of  sense  to 
spread expensive infrastructure into 
these places—or to give ﬁ rms incen-
tives to move to them. What makes 
much more sense is to provide basic 
services everywhere, even if it costs 
more  to  reach  these  distant  areas. 
Encouraging  mobility  of  people  is 
the  priority,  and  institutions  that 
make land markets work better and 
provide security, schools, streets, and 
sanitation should be the mainstay of 
integration policy. 
In  other  countries,  such  as  Brazil, 
lagging areas are densely populated. 
As in China, poor people have moved 
in  the  millions  from  the  northeast 
to  the  southeast.  Everyone  speaks

thing to integrate rural and urban areas, 
and slums with other parts of cities. It 
means  another  to  integrate  lagging 
and leading provinces within a nation. 
And it means yet another to integrate 
isolated and well-connected countries. 
These notions of economic integration 
are central to three debates in develop-
ment—urbanization, territorial devel-
opment, and international integration. 

Urbanization
The arguments and evidence in World 
Development  Report  2009  can  set  pri-
orities for policies at different stages of 
urbanization, essentially providing the 
elements  of  an  urbanization  strategy. 
Each territory or area within a nation 
has a speciﬁ c geography. But the prin-
ciples are quite universal. 

(cid:129) 

In places mostly rural, governments 
should be as neutral as possible and 
should  establish  the  institutional 
foundation  for  possible  urbaniza-
tion in some places. Good land poli-
cies are central, and so are policies to 
provide basic services to everyone. A 
good example is Costa Rica.

the  same  language,  and  domestic 
mobility  is  not  difﬁ cult.  But  many 
poor  people  still  live  in  the  north-
east. Encouraging mobility of people 
from the northeast is important, but 
so  is  enabling  access  to  markets  in 
the dynamic southeast. In such cases, 
both institutions and infrastructure 
to connect the two coastal areas are 
necessary for economic integration. 
In a third group of countries, such as 
India, lagging areas are densely pop-
ulated—almost 60 percent of India’s 
poor live in these poor  places—and 
people can ﬁ nd it difﬁ cult to migrate 
to places doing well, such as the cap-
ital  area  and  the  south.  Language 
and  cultural  differences  within 
some areas can be considerable. In 
such  cases,  institutions  and  infra-
structure could be complemented by 
incentives to producers to locate in 
these lagging states. But these incen-
tives should be carefully designed to 
avoid offsetting the unifying effects 
of  common  institutions  and  con-
nective infrastructure. A promising 

possibility is providing incentives to 
agriculture and allied activities that 
are  appropriate  for  states  that  are 
still mostly rural. 

Regional integration
Finally, the principles developed in this 
Report inform the debates on how to 
make globalization work for all coun-
tries.  The  same  logic  applied  at  the 
local and national levels can be used at 
the international level to classify world 
regions  by  the  difﬁ culty  of  economic 
integration in these regions. The com-
mon  problem  is  division—thick  eco-
nomic borders. Aside from this, the task 
of integration varies in different parts 
of the developing world:

•  Countries in regions close to world 
markets,  such  as  Central  America, 
North  Africa,  and  Eastern  Europe, 
face a relatively straightforward task 
of integration. Common institutions 
can help them become extensions of 
these large markets. 

•  Countries  in  regions  distant  from 
world markets, but with large home 

• 

markets attractive to investors, face a 
more difﬁ cult challenge. Good insti-
tutions and regional infrastructure 
can help them access these markets. 
Examples  include  East  Asia  and, 
increasingly,  South  Asia.  Southern 
Africa and South America can also 
integrate  globally  by  making  their 
home markets bigger and more spe-
cialized  through  regional  institu-
tions and infrastructure.
Integration  is  hardest  for  countries 
in  regions  that  are  divided,  are  dis-
tant  from  world  markets,  and  lack 
the economic density provided by a 
large local economy. These countries 
include  those  nicknamed  the “bot-
tom billion”—East, Central, and West 
Africa; Central Asia; and the Paciﬁ c 
Islands. For these countries, all three 
instruments  are  needed—regional 
institutions that thin borders, regional 
infrastructure that connects countries, 
and  such  incentives  as  preferential 
access to world markets, perhaps con-
ditioned on ensuring that all countries 
strengthen regional cooperation. 

One thing is common to the policy debates on urbanization, area development, and globalization. In their current form, they over-
emphasize geographic targeting—what to do in rural areas or in slums, what to do in lagging states or remote areas, and what to do 
in the most poor or landlocked countries. The Report reframes these debates in a way that better conforms to the reality of growth and 
development. The reality is that the interaction between leading and lagging places is the key to economic development. The reality is 
that spatially targeted interventions are just a small part of what governments can do to help places that are not doing well. The reality 
is that, besides place-based incentives, governments have far more potent instruments for integration. They can build institutions that 
unify all places and put in place infrastructure that connects some places to others. 

The Report calls for rebalancing these policy discussions to include all the instruments of integration—institutions that unify, 
infrastructure that connects, and interventions that target. And it shows how to use the three dimensions of density, distance, and 
division to tailor the use of these policy instruments to address integration challenges that range from the relatively straightforward 
to the most complicated.

Overview

Economic growth will be unbalanced, but development still can be inclusive—that is the mes-
sage of this year’s World Development Report. As economies grow from low to high income, 
production becomes more concentrated spatially. Some places—cities, coastal areas, and con-
nected countries—are favored by producers. As countries develop, the most successful ones also 
institute policies that make living standards of people more uniform across space. The way to get 
both the immediate beneﬁ ts of the concentration of production and the long-term beneﬁ ts of a 
convergence in living standards is economic integration. 

Although the problems of economic integration defy simple solutions, the guiding principle 
does not have to be complex. The policy mix should be calibrated to match the difﬁ culty of the 
development challenge, determined by the economic geography of places. Today, policy discus-
sions about geographic disparities in development often start and end with a consideration of 
spatially targeted interventions. The Report reframes these debates to include all instruments for 
economic integration—institutions, infrastructure, and incentives. The bedrock of integration 
efforts should be spatially blind institutions. As the challenges posed by geography become more 
difﬁ cult, the response should include connective infrastructure. In places where integration is 
hardest, the policy response should be commensurately comprehensive: institutions that unite, 
infrastructure that connects, and interventions that target.

Place and prosperity
Place  is  the  most  important  correlate  of  a 
person’s welfare. In the next few decades, a 
person born in the United States will earn a 
hundred times more than a Zambian, and live 
three decades longer. Behind these national 
averages are numbers even more unsettling. 
Unless things change radically, a child born 
in a village far from Zambia’s capital, Lusaka, 
will live less than half as long as a child born 
in  New  York  City—and  during  that  short 
life, will earn just $0.01 for every $2 the New 
Yorker  earns.  The  New  Yorker  will  enjoy  a 
lifetime  income  of  about  $4.5  million,  the 
rural Zambian less than $10,000. 

A  Bolivian  man  with  nine  years  of 
schooling  earns  an  average  of  about  $460 
per month, in dollars that reﬂ ect purchas-
ing power at U.S. prices. But the same person 

would earn about three times as much in the 
United States. A Nigerian with nine years of 
education would earn eight times as much in 
the United States than in Nigeria. This “place 
premium” is large throughout the develop-
ing world.1 The best predictor of income in 
the  world  today  is  not  what  or  whom  you 
know, but where you work.

Bumps, curves, and spills
These disparities in incomes and living stan-
dards are the outcome of a striking attribute 
of economic development—its unevenness 
across space. Somewhat unfairly, prosper-
ity does not come to every place at the same 
time. This is true at all geographic scales, 
from  local  to  national  to  global.  Cities 
quickly pull ahead of the countryside. Liv-
ing  standards  improve  in  some  provinces

while others lag. And some countries grow 
to riches while others remain poor. If eco-
nomic  density  were  charted  on  a  map  of 
the world, the topography at any resolution 
would be bumpy, not smooth.

Location remains important at all stages 
of development, but it matters less for living 
standards in a rich country than in a poor 
one. Estimates from more than 100 living 
standard surveys indicate that households 
in the most prosperous areas of developing 
countries—such as Brazil, Bulgaria, Ghana, 
Indonesia, Morocco, and Sri Lanka—have 
an average consumption almost 75 percent 
higher  than  that  of  similar  households 
in  the  lagging  areas  of  these  countries. 
Compare  this  with  less  than  25  percent 
for  such  developed  countries  as  Canada, 
Japan, and the United States. In contrast, 
as a country grows richer, location becomes 
more important for economic production. 
Ghana, Poland, and New Zealand—three 
medium-size countries with land areas of 
about  250,000  square  kilometers—have 
vastly  different  per  capita  gross  national 
incomes of about $600, $9,000, and $27,000, 
respectively. The most economically dense 
5  percent  of  the  country’s  area  produces 
about 27 percent of gross domestic product 
(GDP) in Ghana, 31 percent in Poland, and 
39 percent in New Zealand. 

Put another way, as countries develop, 
location matters less for families and more 
for ﬁ rms. Development seems to give a place 
the ability to reap the economic advantages 
of rising concentrations of production, and 
to obtain the social beneﬁ ts that come from 
a convergence in consumption. Economic 
development thus brings with it the condi-
tions of even greater prosperity, in a virtu-
ous circle.

Another  stylized  fact:  neighborhoods 
matter. A prosperous city seldom leaves its 
periphery  mired  in  poverty.  A  province’s 
prosperity  is  sooner  or  later  shared  with 
those  nearby.  And  neighboring  countries 
share  not  just  political  borders  but  eco-
nomic destinies. North America, Western 
Europe, and East Asia are now prosperous 
neighborhoods.  Within  these  regions,  all 
countries did not grow in lockstep. Within 
countries, some provinces did better, and 
within  each  province,  prosperity  came  at 
different times to cities, towns, and villages. 

Less  widely  appreciated  is  the  fact  that 
places  near  prosperous  provinces,  coun-
tries, and regions have invariably beneﬁ ted. 
Prosperity produces congestion and causes 
economic activity to spill over, but only to 
places that are well connected to these pros-
perous  parts.  The  detrimental  effects  of 
poverty, instability, and conﬂ ict spill over 
as well. To prosperous places, proximity is 
a blessing, to poor places, a curse.

These three attributes of development—
geographic unevenness, circular causation, 
and neighborhood effects—have not always 
received  much  attention.  They  should, 
because they have radical implications for 
public policy.

(cid:129)  Geographic unevenness—the ﬁ rst attri-
bute  of  development—implies  that 
governments  generally  cannot  simulta-
neously foster economic production and 
spread it out smoothly. 

(cid:129)  Circular  causation—the  second  attri-
bute—provides  hope  for  policy  makers 
wishing to pursue progressive objectives. 
Rising concentrations of economic pro-
duction are compatible with geographic 
convergence in living standards. And the 
market forces of agglomeration, migra-
tion, and specialization can, if combined 
with  progressive  policies,  yield  both  a 
concentration  of  economic  production 
and a convergence of living standards. 

(cid:129)  Neighborhood  effects—the  third  attri-
bute—come with a principle for policy 
making: promote economic integration. 
Unevenness and circularity imply that it 
is more difﬁ cult for places left behind to 
catch up. But spillovers point to the prom-
ise for surmounting this handicap. Eco-
nomic integration is an effective and the 
most realistic way to harness the immedi-
ate beneﬁ ts from concentration to achieve 
the long-term beneﬁ ts of convergence. 

Putting this principle of economic inte-
gration  into  practice  requires  identifying 
the  market  forces  and  government  poli-
cies  that  best  support  the  concentration 
of economic mass and the convergence of 
living standards across different locations. 
It also requires recognizing that these mar-
ket  forces  can  be  strong  or  weak  depend-
ing on economic geography. Earlier World

Overview

Development Reports have studied these phe-
nomena. This Report advances the inﬂ uence 
of geography on economic opportunity by 
elevating space and place from mere under-
currents in policy to a major focus.

The problem—at three geographic scales
Depending  on  the  “geographic  scale,”  the 
market forces to be harnessed or supported 
differ. At a smaller scale—say, an area within 
a country (a province or state)—geography 
poses  different  challenges  than  at  a  larger 
geographic scale—say, a country. At an even 
larger  geographic  scale—say,  a  group  of 
countries that form a geographic region—the 
market forces that work toward integration 
can be blocked by even greater geographic 
and political obstacles (see box 1). 

Locally,  the  concentration  of  eco-
nomic production as countries develop is 

manifest in urbanization. In East Asia, for 
example,  if  current  trends  continue,  the 
urban  population  is  expected  to  increase 
by about 450 million people over the next 
two  decades,  as  countries  in  the  regions 
grow,  adding  the  equivalent  of  a  Paris 
every  month.  In  South  and  Central  Asia, 
the increase is expected to be almost 350 
million.  And  in  Sub-Saharan  Africa—if 
economies  continue  to  grow—the  urban 
population could increase by 250 million 
between 2005 and 2025. In other parts of 
the developing world, within-urban trans-
formations will be as important.

The  question  is  whether  growing  con-
centrations  of  humanity  will  increase 
prosperity,  or  produce  congestion  and 
squalor.  Another  concern  is  the  diver-
gence  in  living  standards  between  those 
who  beneﬁ t  most  from  this  geographic 

BOX 1    Three geographic scales: local, national, and international

Consider the “neighborhoods” of Lagos 
State, Nigeria, and West Africa (see the 
maps below). 
•  The fi rst geographic scale is the area. 
The state of Lagos in southwestern 
Nigeria has the fi ve districts of Badagry, 
Epe, Ikeja, Ikorodu, and Lagos, cover-
ing about 3,500 square kilometers. Its 
estimated population density—with 
the smallest land area but among the 
two most populous in the nation—is 
about 2,600 persons per square kilome-
ter. Metropolitan Lagos has a density 
more than three times that, fueled by 

agglomeration economies and rural-
urban migration. 

•  The second geographic scale is the coun-
try. With its 36 states and capital area 
and covering 924,000 square kilome-
ters, Nigeria is the world’s 32nd larg-
est country. The distance from Lagos 
to the northeastern tip of Nigeria is 
almost 1,500 kilometers. The southern 
states have seaports and oilfi elds. The 
northern part, once a seat of ancient 
empires, now has higher poverty. 
Migration between the north and the 
south is not an easy matter because 

Three geographic units: area, country, and region
Lagos State, Nigeria, and West Africa represent the local, national, and international scales

of religious and linguistic diff erences. 
The sharing of oil wealth is a source of 
tension. 

•  The third geographic scale is the region. 

Nigeria’s West African neighbors 
include Cameroon, the Central African 
Republic, Côte d’Ivoire, Equatorial 
Guinea, Ghana, Niger, and Togo. The 
region covers more than 6 million 
square kilometers, divided by some of 
the world’s thickest borders.

concentration—essentially  urbanites  in 
prosperous neighborhoods—and those left 
behind in villages and those living in slums, 
estimated to number about 1 billion in the 
developing world (see map 1, panel a). The 
(ineffective)  policy  responses  so  far  have 
been to try to slow down urbanization.

At the national scale, economic growth 
displays a similar unevenness, as places close 
to large markets prosper sooner than places 
more distant. In China the coastal provinc-
es—mainly in the three areas known as the 
Bohai Basin, the Pearl River Delta, and the 
Yangtze River Delta—accounted for more 
than  half  of  the  country’s  GDP  in  2005, 
with less than a ﬁ fth of its area. In Brazil 
the  south-central  states  of  Minas  Gerais, 
Rio de Janeiro, and São Paulo account for 
more than 52 percent of the country’s GDP, 
with less than 15 percent of its land area. 
Greater  Cairo  produces  50  percent  of  the 
Arab Republic of Egypt’s GDP, using just 
0.5 percent of its land area.

Politicians generally view this economic 
imbalance  disapprovingly.  In  communist 
Russia  the  government  labored  to  reduce 
the  economic  share  of  the  old  industrial 
area of St. Petersburg, the Center, and the 
mid-Urals  from  65  percent  to  32  percent, 
forcibly shifting production to the eastern 
areas. It boosted the share of the east in eco-
nomic production from 4 percent in 1925 
to  28  percent  at  the  end  of  communism, 
whose demise probably was hastened by the 
spatial inefﬁ ciency that these efforts engen-
dered. Because governments care so much 
about domestic disparities, they jeopardize 
competitiveness and risk collapse. Policies 
to  reduce  interstate  or  provincial  dispari-
ties in production and living standards are 
commonplace—but  largely  ineffective. 
About 1 billion people continue to live in 
these inhospitable lagging areas (see map 1, 
panel b).

At  the  international  scale,  economic 
growth  has  concentrated  global  produc-
tion in a few regions, with commensurate 
differences  in  incomes.  In  2000  about 
three- quarters of world GDP was concen-
trated in North America, Western Europe, 
and Northeast Asia. This concentration is 
not  new.  Three  centuries  ago,  China  and 
India  accounted  for  about  two-thirds  of 
the world’s wealth. What was different then 

is that they also had more than half of the 
world’s  population;  the  European  Union 
(EU), Japan, and the United States have less 
than one-sixth. 

Today,  the  worry  at  the  international 
level  is  the  high  poverty,  illiteracy,  and 
mortality  in  some  parts  of  the  world,  set 
against the prosperity, literacy, and longev-
ity in others. The policy responses include 
foreign aid and multilateral efforts to ease 
international trade and investment ﬂ ows. 
But barriers to the agricultural exports of 
developing countries remain considerable, 
and  apathy  for  people  distant  or  distinct 
renders aid ﬂ ows miniscule. Aid will be a 
small part of the solution. Even in the Euro-
pean Union, with a combined GDP of about 
€8 trillion, annual aid through the struc-
tural and cohesion funds will average less 
than  €50  billion  between  2007  and  2013. 
Foreign aid is less than 0.5 percent of the 
gross national income of giving countries, 
and  not  even  a  large  fraction  of  the  GDP 
of countries home to the “bottom billion” 
who have 12 percent of the world’s popula-
tion, but less than 1 percent of its GDP (see 
map 1, panel c).2

A billion slum dwellers in the developing 
world’s cities, a billion people in fragile lag-
ging areas within countries, a billion at the 
bottom of the global hierarchy of nations—
these overlapping populations pose today’s 
biggest development challenges. Seemingly 
disparate, they share a fundamental feature: 
at different spatial scales, they are the most 
visible manifestation of economic geogra-
phy’s importance for development. 

Concern for these intersecting 3 billion 
sometimes comes with the prescription that 
economic growth must be made more spa-
tially balanced. The growth of cities must 
be controlled. Rural-urban gaps in wealth 
must be reduced quickly. Lagging areas and 
provinces distant from domestic and world 
markets must be sustained through territo-
rial development programs that bring jobs 
to  the  people  living  there.  And  growing 
gaps between the developed and developing 
world must be addressed through interven-
tions  to  protect  enterprises  in  developing 
countries until they are ready to compete. 
World  Development  Report  2009  has 
a  different  message:  economic  growth 
is  seldom  balanced.  Efforts  to  spread  it

BOX 2     The three dimensions of development: density, distance, and division

This Report uses three geographic dimen-
sions to describe the transformation of 
economies as they develop (part one) 
and the conditions to keep in mind when 
formulating policies (part three). The 
words are easy metaphors, since density, 
distance, and division summon images of 
human, physical, and political geography. 
But they can be measured. Consider this 
illustration. 

In 2003 Nigeria had 45 million goats and 

kids, 28 million sheep and lambs, and 15 
million cattle. In a typical year 8 million 
sheep, 7 million goats, and 0.5 million 
cattle are slaughtered, mostly in fi ve north-
ern states including Kano. More than half 
the hides are consumed as pomo. The rest 
are sold to tanneries. The demand from 
tanneries exceeds local supply, so animals 
are imported from nearby Chad, Niger, 
and Cameroon. Goat and sheep skins are 
good business—in 2001 Nigeria produced 
30 million to 35 million of them, exporting 
almost all to Europe. 

Density. Consider the market condi-

tions for a tannery that produces leather 
in the city of Kano in Northern Nigeria. 
Offi  cially, the population of Kano State is 
about 9 million, large enough to provide 
the skilled labor and infrastructure for 
its tanneries. Due to the concentration 
of people in and around Kano city, the 

area’s economic density (GDP per square 
kilometer) was 35 times that of Nigeria 
in 1990. The capacity of the tanneries in 
and around the city even makes it worth-
while to illegally import live animals—the 
most important intermediate input—
from neighboring countries. But Kano is 
neither large enough, nor rich enough, 
to consume more than a little of what is 
produced. The goods must be exported 
to people willing to pay enough to make 
production worthwhile. 

Distance. Wealthy Europeans want 
goods made with “Morocco leather,” a 
lot of which comes from Kano. To get to 
Europe, Kano’s bulky exports must travel 
through Lagos, which along highways 
and railways is about 1,000 kilometers 
away. It might as well be 4,000 kilome-
ters. A railway goes to Lagos through 
the cities of Kaduna and Ibadan, but it is 
narrow gauge and poorly maintained. 
Most commerce is by road, obstructed by 
roadblocks and piracy. Shipping compa-
nies charge more than $1,200 for a 30-ton 
trailer from Kano to Lagos. Once the 
goods get to Lagos, there are port fees, 
pilferage, and delays. It takes 26 days to 
get the goods onto a ship. The economic 
distance from Kano to Lagos, measured 
as money, is several times the Euclidean 
(straight-line) 829 kilometers. 

Division. But the journey is not yet 
complete. The goods must surmount 
the division caused by diff erences in 
currencies and conventions between 
Nigeria and Europe. Between December 
2007 and March 2008, Nigeria’s currency 
depreciated from 170 naira to €1 to 
180 naira, but appreciated from 246 naira 
to the British pound in November 2007 
to 235 naira in March 2008. Buyers and 
sellers of leather goods have to contend 
with these fl uctuations. They must also 
deal with two sets of laws and customs. 
The United Kingdom has 30 procedures 
for enforcing a contract, Nigeria 39. These 
divisions multiply the costs of doing 
business. Few cargo ships make landfall 
in Lagos, so it costs much more to trans-
port goods from Lagos than from busier 
places such as Shanghai. It costs less than 
$400 to ship a container to the United 
Kingdom from China, more than $1,000 
from Nigeria.

Low local density, costly internal dis-

tances, and international divisions conspire 
against Kano. Making matters more diffi  cult 
are religious and other divisions within 
Nigeria.

ment of Nigeria 2003.

prematurely will jeopardize progress. Two 
centuries  of  economic  development  show 
that spatial disparities in income and pro-
duction are inevitable. A generation of eco-
nomic research conﬁ rms this: there is no 
good reason to expect economic growth to 
spread smoothly across space. The experi-
ence  of  successful  developers  shows  that 
production  becomes  more  concentrated 
spatially. The most successful nations also 
institute  policies  that  make  basic  living 
standards more uniform across space. Eco-
nomic production concentrates, while liv-
ing standards converge. 

Part  one  of  the  Report  describes  the 
geographic transformations that are neces-
sary for development. Part two analyzes the 
drivers of these changes and identiﬁ es the 
markets that deliver both concentration and 

convergence. Part three proposes the prin-
ciple  of  economic  integration—between 
places  that  producers  prefer  and  places 
where people live—to guide policy making. 
Using this principle, it reframes the debates 
on  urbanization,  territorial  development, 
and international integration, calling for a 
change in orientation of policies away from 
geographic targeting toward integration. 

By using a well-calibrated blend of insti-
tutions, infrastructure, and interventions, 
today’s  developers  can  reshape  their  eco-
nomic geography. When they do this well, 
they  will  experience  unbalanced  growth 
and inclusive development.

nomic development can be characterized in

three  dimensions—density,  distance,  and 
division. These three words are not just met-
aphors for the policy challenges just outlined. 
They conform closely to the more technical 
notion of “market access” (see box 2). And 
they represent the dimensions of economic 
geography  that  have  to  be  reshaped  if  the 
development challenges are to be met. 

Understanding  the  transformations 
along the dimensions of density, distance, 
and  division  helps  to  identify  the  main 
market  forces  and  the  appropriate  policy 
responses at each of the three geographic 
scales—local,  national,  and  international 
(see table 1). 
(cid:129)  Density is the most important dimension 
locally. Distances are short, and cultural 
and political divisions are few and shal-
low. The policy challenge is getting den-
sity right—harnessing market forces to 
encourage  concentration  and  promote 
convergence in living standards between 
villages  and  towns  and  cities.  But  dis-
tance can be important as rapid urban-
ization leads to congestion, and divisions 
within  cities  can  be  manifest  in  slums 
and ghettos. 

(cid:129)  Distance to density is the most impor-
tant  dimension  at  the  national  geo-
graphic  scale.  Distance  between  areas 
where economic activity is concentrated 
and areas that lag is the main dimension. 
The  policy  challenge  is  helping  ﬁ rms 

and workers reduce their distance from 
density. The main mechanisms are the 
mobility of labor and the reduction of 
transport costs through infrastructure 
investments.  Divisions  within  coun-
tries—differences in language, currency, 
and culture—tend to be small, though 
large countries such as India and Nigeria 
may be geographically divided because 
of religion, ethnicity, or language.

(cid:129)  Division is the most important dimen-
sion  internationally.  But  distance  and 
density are also relevant. Economic pro-
duction is concentrated in a few world 
regions—North  America,  Northeast 
Asia,  and  Western  Europe—that  are 
also the most integrated. Other regions, 
by  contrast,  are  divided.  While  dis-
tance matters at the international level, 
for  access  to  world  markets,  divisions 
associated  with  the  impermeability  of 
borders  and  differences  in  currencies 
and regulations are a more serious bar-
rier  than  distance.  Having  a  large  and 
dynamic  economy  within  the  neigh-
borhood  can  help  smaller  countries, 
especially in regions distant from world 
markets. For economies in other regions 
such as Central Africa and Central Asia, 
international integration is hardest. 

But  the  potential  problem  at  each  of 
these geographic scales is the same—people 
in one place, production in another. Places

attract production and people at different 
speeds,  and  these  differences  determine 
geographic  disparities  in  income.  Across 
provinces, nations, and the world, develop-
ment comes in waves and leaves behind a 
bumpy economic landscape—prosperity in 
some places, poverty in others.

The world is not flat
Development  is  neither  smooth  nor  lin-
ear—at  any  geographic  scale.  Growth 
comes earlier to some places than to others. 
Geographic differences in living standards 
diverge before converging, faster at the local 
scale and slower as geography exercises its 
inﬂ uence. These are the stylized facts, based 
on the experiences of successful developers 
over the last two centuries. 

Economic production becomes 
more concentrated 
As countries develop, people and economic 
activities become more concentrated. But 
the speed varies, depending on the spatial 
scale—economic forces do not operate in 
a  geographic  vacuum.  The  concentration 
of people and production is fastest locally, 
slowest internationally. 
(cid:129)  Concentration is fastest locally. Economic 
concentration at the local scale is most 
conveniently  measured  by  the  rate  of 
urbanization—the growth of economic 
and population density in towns and cit-
ies. A large part of this geographic trans-
formation  has  been  completed  when 
countries  reach  per  capita  incomes  of 
about $3,500, roughly the threshold for 
crossing into upper-middle incomes. The 
speed of this transformation is no differ-
ent from what was seen in today’s devel-
oped countries when they transformed. 
The implication is that all nations must 
manage  a  rapid  growth  of  cities  when 
they still have low incomes and nascent 
institutions.

(cid:129)  Concentration  is  steadier  nationally. 
Here,  it  can  best  be  measured  by  area 
development indicators—the accumula-
tion of production and people in leading 
areas. A large part of this transforma-
tion generally is completed when coun-
tries reach per capita incomes of about 

$10,000–$11,000, about the threshold for 
crossing into high incomes. This is the 
experience of successful developers. The 
implication is that developing countries 
should expect rising subnational dispari-
ties in income and production when they 
still have underdeveloped infrastructure 
and institutions.

(cid:129)  Concentration  is  slowest  internation-
ally, and it continues longer. Production 
and  wealth  continue  to  concentrate  in 
countries beyond per capita incomes of 
$25,000, the upper reaches of the inter-
national income distribution. Neighbor-
hoods of nations seem to grow or stagnate 
together—nearness to prosperity helps, 
while nearness to poor nations hurts. The 
implication is that growth strategies for 
later developers are not the same as the 
strategies that worked for those who have 
already grown to high-income levels; for 
today’s developing countries, economic 
integration with the rest of the world—
neighbors and distant countries—is even 
more essential. 

Local concentration (in towns and cit-
ies) happens quickly. Consider ﬁ rst the rising 
concentration of people in towns and cities. 
As countries develop, the economic density 
in some places increases as more people move 
to live in or near towns and cities (see ﬁ gure 
1, panel a). The urban share of the population 
rises sharply—from about 10 percent to 50 
percent—as countries grow from low income 
to  lower-middle  incomes  of  about  $3,500. 
(It  is  difﬁ cult  to  make  international  com-
parisons  because  countries  deﬁ ne  “urban” 
differently.3)  Between  2000  and  2005,  the 
average  urban  population  growth  for  low-
income countries was 3 percent a year, more 
than twice the rate for middle-income coun-
tries and more than three times the rate for 
high-income countries. Sometimes, this can 
mean rapid growth of a single city, such as 
Bangkok, Thailand, producing even greater 
concentration. 

The  share  of  urban  residents  in  total 
household consumption rises too. Urbanites 
in Malawi, Jordan, and Panama—countries 
with per capita GDPs of about $160, $1,600, 
and $5,600 respectively—account for 36, 63, 
and 80 percent of aggregate consumption.

These  spatial  transformations  are 
closely  related  to  the  sectoral  transfor-
mation  of  countries  from  agrarian  to 
industrial  and  then,  in  a  postindustrial 
economy,  to  services.  Today’s  high-in-
come  countries  experienced  a  similar 
rush  to  urbanize  as  they  industrialized 
(see chapter 1). All the evidence indicates 
that the shift from farming to industry is 
helped, not hurt, by healthy agriculture, 
which  helps  towns  and  cities  prosper.4 
People move to make their own lives bet-
ter.  But  when  agriculture  is  doing  well, 
migration makes not just them better off, 
but  also  the  villages  they  leave  and  the 
cities in which they settle.

National  concentration  (in  leading 
areas) continues for longer. What is true of 
cities is also true of areas within countries, 
but at a slower speed. With development, 
people  and  production  become  concen-
trated  in  some  parts  of  countries,  called 
“leading” areas. Economic density grows in 
these parts—Marmara in Turkey, for exam-
ple—while incomes in places economically 
distant—such as southeastern Anatolia in 
the east—can lag far behind. This concen-
tration is hard to quantify, but it appears to 
slow or stop at per capita incomes between 
$10,000 and $15,000 (see ﬁ gure 1, panel b).
Initially,  the  concentration  increases 
rapidly. The share of total consumption of 
the leading areas in countries with incomes 
ranging between $500 and $7,500—Tajik-
istan,  Mongolia,  El  Salvador,  and  Argen-
tina—increases  from  30  percent  to  65 
percent.  Comparing  GDP  concentrations 
in countries with the same land area— Lao 
PDR,  Ghana,  Poland,  and  Norway—but 
with incomes from $600 to $27,000 shows 
concentration rising as incomes increase.

This  is  nothing  new.  Production  in 
today’s  developed  economies  grew  more 
concentrated  until  they  reached  high 
incomes. Concentration in France’s leading 
area  quadrupled  between  1800  and  1960, 
and French incomes grew from $1,000 to 
$6,000. But at some point, nations continue 
to grow wealthier but not more concentrat-
ed—about  when  they  enter  the  ranks  of 
high-income countries. There are no rea-
sons  to  expect  greatly  different  patterns 
today (see chapter 2).

International  concentration  (in  some 
world regions and leading countries) con-
tinues for a while. A similar concentration 
of economic mass has occurred internation-
ally.  Today,  a  quarter  of  the  world’s  GDP 
can ﬁ t into an area the size of Cameroon, 
and a half into one the size of Algeria. In 
1980 the shares of the EU15, North Amer-
ica, and East Asia added up to 70 percent; 
in 2000 the sum was 83 percent.5 Within 
these  regions,  economic  activity  became 
more concentrated in a few countries over 
time before it became more dispersed. The 
shares of France, Germany, and the United 
Kingdom in the EU15 regional GDP rose to 
about two-thirds by 1940, before falling to 
about half today. In East Asia, the share of 
Japan in the region’s GDP rose to 83 percent 
in 1975 and then fell to 62 percent by 2000.
There is no reason to expect that, when 
they prosper, other parts of the world will not 
experience the same patterns—a rising con-
centration  in  some  countries,  before  over-
ﬂ owing to their neighbors (see chapter 3). 

Living standards diverge before 
converging
As incomes increase, living standards con-
verge between places where economic mass 
has concentrated and where it has not, but 
not before diverging. 
(cid:129)  Essential household consumption converges 
soonest.  Rural-urban  gaps  in  essential 
household  consumption  diminish  quite 
rapidly. Even for countries that have urban 
shares of about 50 to 60 percent, these dif-
ferences can be small. Area differences in 
poverty rates are more persistent, inter-
national differences even more so. But as 
the world has developed, these gaps have 
diminished at all geographic scales. 

(cid:129)  Access  to  basic  public  services  converges 
next. Rural-urban gaps in basic educa-
tion, health, drinking water, and sani-
tation  persist  until  countries  reach 
upper-middle incomes. But within-city 
disparities in these services—most vis-
ible as slums—persist well past high lev-
els  of  urbanization  and  upper-middle 
incomes. 

(cid:129)  Wages and incomes converge last. Indeed, 
wages and incomes diverge between lag-

ging and leading areas of a country as it 
grows  through  low  and  lower-middle 
incomes,  the  same  range  of  per  capita 
incomes needed for territorial concentra-
tion  to  increase.  And  global  divergence 
in  wages  and  wealth  appears  to  go  on 
for much longer. East Asia saw per capita 
incomes diverge between 1950 and 1970 
as Japan pulled ahead. Then, Japan’s pros-
perity spilled over into the neighborhood, 
and  incomes  converged  as  countries  in 
the region that integrated internationally 
prospered. Among the countries of West 
Asia, by contrast, there was no divergence 
in incomes—nor was there rapid growth.

Convergence in living standards, like con-
centration of economic activity, takes place 
faster at the local geographic scale and slow-
est at the international. But this happens only 
in prosperous neighborhoods. Even in such 
places,  some  measures  of  living  standards 
(such  as  per  capita  consumption,  income, 
or  earnings)  take  a  long  time  to  converge, 
sometimes  even  with  an  initial  divergence 
(see ﬁ gure 2). For others, such as education 
and health indicators, it can be quicker. 

Locally, convergence in basic living stan-
dards sets in early. Urban-to-rural gaps in 
consumption levels rise until countries reach 
upper-middle-income levels (see ﬁ gure 2). 
But they fall soon after, and become small 
even before they get to high-income levels of 
around $10,000 per capita. Access to water 
and sanitation in urban areas is more than 
25 percent higher in urban areas for the less 
urbanized  countries.  For  countries  with 
urbanization rates of about 50 percent, such 
as Algeria, Colombia, and South Africa, the 
disparity in access is about 15 percent. For 
such countries as Brazil, Chile, Gabon, and 
Jordan, the disparity is less than 10 percent. 
This pattern is also seen within countries. 
Provinces  that  are  more  prosperous  and 
urbanized have smaller rural-urban gaps in 
living standards. This is true even in coun-
tries at low levels of income, such as China, 
India, and the Philippines. But within highly 
urbanized areas, gaps in basic living stan-
dards such as sanitation and schools tend to 
persist. Despite the best efforts of govern-
ments, for example, slums mark the urban 
landscape in countries well after they reach

high-income levels. It is common for one-
third of a developing city’s population to live 
in slums. 

Nationally,  divergence  in  living  stan-
dards  happens  quickly,  but  convergence 
is slower. At early levels of income, provin-
cial or interarea disparities in basic living 
standards can be small. But they increase 
quickly as countries grow. In low-income 
Cambodia,  for  example,  the  gap  between 
leading and lagging areas in consumption 
of otherwise-similar households is almost 
90  percent.  In  middle-income  Argentina, 
the gap is 50 percent; but in contemporary 
Canada, it is just 20 percent. In the rapidly 
growing East Asian and Eastern European 
countries,  for  example,  these  gaps  have 
increased rapidly. 

A few countries such as Chile have been 
exceptions.  Between  1960  and  2000,  it 
experienced geographic convergence while 
its  GDP  per  capita  more  than  doubled  to 
about  $10,500.  In  Colombia,  the  ratio  of 
GDP  of  leading  Bogotá  to  lagging  Choco 
fell  from  10  to  3  between  1950  and  1990. 
Less exceptional is convergence in poverty, 
basic health, nutrition, and education lev-
els  between  areas  within  countries.  Fast-
growing  countries  everywhere  have  been 
able to quickly translate economic progress 
into spatial equity in these more basic liv-
ing standards. 

Internationally, divergence in incomes 
continues  a  while,  and  convergence 
is  slowest.  Global  GDP  per  capita  has 
increased  almost  tenfold  since  1820.  Life 
expectancy has doubled. Literacy rates have 
increased from less than 20 to more than 
80 percent. But these gains have not been 
shared equally. Europe and its offshoots—
Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the 
United States—and more lately Japan and 
its neighbors have seen enormous increases 
in income and living standards. 

For incomes, the convergence has hap-
pened only in the fastest-growing regions 
of the world. The pattern has been uneven 
within  these  countries—a  few  countries 
lead,  resulting  in  divergence  within  the 
neighborhood,  and  then  growth  appears 
to spill over into their neighbors. In other 
regions  such  as  Western  Asia,  there  is 
no  divergence—cold  comfort  because

America—Argentina,  Brazil,  Chile,  and 
Uruguay—with Italy, Portugal, and Spain 
in  southern  Europe.  Between  1950  and 
2006, convergence within southern Europe 
took place at 1 percent per year, but in South 
America at just 0.3 percent. 

In contrast to incomes, global inequal-
ity in access to basic living standards—life 
expectancy and education—has been fall-
ing since 1930. These improvements have 
picked  up  pace  since  1960  and  have  been 
shared across all regions. 

The world is different today, 
but the past provides useful lessons
The general patterns of concentration and 
convergence are likely to remain the same 
for  today’s  developing  countries  as  they 
were  for  early  developers.  But  there  are 
some  differences  because  of  reasons  that 
are technological and political. 

Bigger cities. Thanks to better medicine 
and transport, the world is now more pop-
ulated and cities are much larger. Between 
1985  and  2005,  the  urban  population  in 
developing  countries  grew  by  more  than 
8.3 million a year, almost three times the 
annual  increase  of  3  million  for  today’s 
high-income countries between 1880 and 
1900, when their incomes were comparable. 
If  China  and  India  are  excluded,  though, 
the annual increase is less than 4.5 million, 
about 50 percent more than a century ago. 
The big difference is that the world’s larg-
est  cities  are  today  much  larger.  London 
had fewer than 7 million people in 1900; 
the  largest  city  among  low-income  coun-
tries  today  (Mumbai)  is  three  times  that 
size. So is Mexico City, the largest city in 
middle-income countries. The average size 
of the world’s largest 100 cities has grown 
to almost 10 times their size in 1900 (see 
ﬁ gure 3, panel a), and almost two-thirds of 
these cities are in developing countries. 

Wider markets. Because of advances in 
communications  and  transport  technol-
ogy, the notion of markets is more global. 
Global trade as a share of production is now 
more  than  25  percent,  almost  ﬁ ve  times 
more than in 1900 (see ﬁ gure 3, panel b). 
The  openness  to  trade  and  capital  ﬂ ows 
that makes markets more global also makes 
subnational  disparities  in  income  larger 

and  persist  for  longer  in  today’s  develop-
ing  countries.  Not  all  parts  of  a  country 
are suited for accessing world markets, and 
coastal and economically dense places do 
better. China’s GDP per capita in 2007 was 
the same as that of Britain in 1911. Shang-
hai, China’s leading area, today has a GDP 
per capita the same as Britain in 1988, while 
lagging Guizhou is closer to Britain in 1930. 
China’s size, the openness of coastal China 
to world trade, and Shanghai’s location are 
the reasons. 

More borders. While markets are becom-
ing  more  international  because  of  better 
transport and communications, the world 
has  become  more  politically  fragmented. 
In 1900 there were about 100 international 
borders (see ﬁ gure 3, panel c). Today, there 
are more than 600, as nations in Asia and 
Africa  gained  independence  from  Euro-
pean colonizers, and the Soviet Union and 
other communist countries broke up into 
smaller nations. The fragmentation of the 
world  into  more  nations  means  smaller 
domestic markets. But at the same time, the 
potential for accessing foreign markets has 
been growing. In any case, thinner borders 
between countries now bring greater pay-
offs for producers and workers. 

Do such differences in technology mean 
that the past provides no lessons? Are cit-
ies in developing countries too large, and 
would  these  countries  be  better  off  if 
urbanization were slowed? Should today’s 
developing  countries  be  more  concerned 
about  regional  disparities  in  production 
and income than developed countries were 
at a comparable stage of development? Is it 
easier today for all developing countries to 
access global markets and offset the disad-
vantages associated with greater fragmenta-
tion? This Report shows why the answer to 
all these questions is no.

Markets shape the economic 
landscape
Rising  densities  of  human  settlements, 
migrations of workers and entrepreneurs to 
shorten the distance to markets, and lower 
divisions caused by differences in curren-
cies and conventions between countries are 
central  to  successful  economic  develop-
ment.  The  spatial  transformations  along

changing the economic landscape of today’s 
most  successful  developing  countries,  in 
ways similar in scope and speed. Growing 
cities,  mobile  people,  and  vigorous  trade 
have been the catalysts for progress in the 
developed world over the last two centuries. 
Now these forces are powering the develop-
ing world’s most dynamic places. 

The realm of “agglomeration 
economies”
A trip on National Highway 321 east from 
Chengdu in Sichuan province to Shenzhen 
in  Guangdong  is  a  journey  through  eco-
nomic  development.  Migrating  workers 
who travel these highways often leave their 
families  behind.  But  they  also  help  their 
families escape poverty and propel China 
through the ranks of middle-income coun-
tries.  As  they  travel  eastward,  they  leave 
an  agrarian  realm  in  which  they  receive 
few  beneﬁ ts  from  working  in  proximity 
to others. Instead, they enter the realm of 
“agglomeration economies,” in which being 
near other people produces huge beneﬁ ts. 

Shenzhen  attracts  young  workers—90 
percent  of  its  8  million  residents  are  of 
working  age.  It  specializes  in  electronic 
goods.  But  it  makes  them  in  enormous 
quantities.  In  2006  its  exports  exceeded 
India’s, making its seaport the fourth busi-
est in the world. Propelled by the forces of 
agglomeration, migration, and specializa-
tion,  and  helped  by  its  nearness  to  Hong 
Kong, China, Shenzhen has grown the fast-
est of all cities in China since 1979, when it 
was designated a special economic zone. 

This story is being replayed in India. In 
1990 Sriperumbudur was known mostly as 
the place where Prime Minister Rajiv Gan-
dhi was assassinated. In 2006 his widow, 
Sonia  Gandhi,  watched  as  Nokia’s  tele-
phone plant churned out its 20-millionth 
handset.6  The  plant  had  begun  produc-
tion  just  earlier  that  year.  With  neither 
Shenzhen’s favored administrative status 
nor  its  infrastructure,  Sriperumbudur 
may be on its way to becoming a national, 
perhaps even regional, hub for electronic 
goods. The key is the town’s proximity to 
Chennai, just as Shenzhen’s proximity to 
Hong  Kong,  China,  was  instrumental  in 
its growth.

these three dimensions—density, distance, 
and  division—have  been  most  noticeable 
in  Japan,  North  America,  and  Western 
Europe.  Fast  and  frequent  movements  of 
people  and  products  have  helped  North 
America, Western Europe, and Northeast 
Asia  account  for  about  three-fourths  of 
global production with less than a sixth of 
the world’s people.

tion,  migration,  and  specialization  are

In 1965, when independence was thrust 
on Singapore, it was not near any prosper-
ous or peaceful place. Instead, it lay between 
Malaysia and Indonesia, two poor countries 
that had been ravaged by war between colo-
nizers. Three-quarters of Singapore’s popu-
lation  lived  in  tenements.  By  1980  it  had 
industrialized,  specializing  in  electronics, 
much as Shenzhen is doing now. By 1986 it 
was the world’s busiest container port and 
Southeast  Asia’s  ﬁ nancial  hub.  Along  the 
way, by instituting land markets, building 
efﬁ cient transport infrastructure, and inter-
vening to improve housing, it cleaned up its 
slums. Prosperity spilled over into neighbor-
ing Malaysia. Malaysia’s  manufacturing-led 
prosperity in turn helped more than 2 mil-
lion Indonesians who streamed in to ﬁ ll jobs 
in  construction  and  services.  Singapore’s 
businessmen jet around Asia, fueling growth 
in places farther than Shenzhen and Sriper-
umbudur. The “little red dot” on a map—as 
reportedly  derided  by  a  neighboring  pres-
ident7—has  transformed  itself,  integrated 
its neighborhood, and overtaken Britain, its 
former colonizer (see map 2). 

Singapore,  Shenzhen,  and  Sriperum-
budur show how scale economies in pro-
duction, movements of labor and capital, 
and falling transport costs interact to pro-
duce rapid economic growth in cities and 
countries both large and small. These are 
the engine of any economy, with a role so 
fundamental  in  prosperity  and  poverty 
reduction that they are the subject of the

ﬁ rst three chapters of the most inﬂ uential 
economics text ever written, Adam Smith’s 
The Wealth of Nations. 

The economies of scale emphasized by 
Smith can be categorized into three types—
those  exclusive  to  ﬁ rms,  those  shared  by 
ﬁ rms  in  the  same  industry  and  location, 
and those more generally available to pro-
ducers in a larger urban area.
(cid:129)  With fewer than 17,000 people, Sriper-
umbudur  was  large  enough  for  Hyun-
dai  to  set  up  a  big  plant  there  in  1999. 
By  2006  the  town  had  helped  Hyundai 
produce its millionth automobile. Basic 
education and health services, proximity 
to a port, and basic infrastructure were 
all it needed to facilitate plant-level scale 
economies. The evidence is that internal 
scale economies are high in such heavy 
industries  as  shipbuilding,  and  low  in 
such  light  industries  as  garments.  The 
town  has  enough  workers  to  enable 
matching workers and jobs in big plants. 
So  towns  like  Sriperumbudur  are  large 
enough to facilitate internal economies.

(cid:129)  Shenzhen  Special  Economic  Region—
with an area of just 300 square kilometers 
but a population of almost 3 million—is 
home to a bustling electronics industry. 
With a ready supply of skilled and semi-
skilled young workers, the area is invest-
ing  in  better  education  and  research 
facilities to ensure that the city supplies 
what the industry needs. Its port ships in 
intermediate inputs and ships out ﬁ nal 
products. It shares expensive facilities, 
such  as  top-notch  container  ports  and 
convention centers, and matches work-
ers  to  the  growing  number  of  jobs  as 
ﬁ rms  rapidly  expand  their  operations. 
Proximity  to  Hong  Kong,  China,  pro-
vides access to ﬁ nance, though Shenzhen 
is home to a rapidly expanding ﬁ nancial 
sector. And competition for customers 
among the multiple suppliers of inputs 
produces cost savings. The area excels in 
providing, in economic jargon, localiza-
tion economies. 

(cid:129)  Singapore  has  passed  through  these 
stages  and  is  now  one  of  the  world’s 
top centers of commerce. By providing 
a stable economic environment, excel-

lent transport links, livability, and efﬁ -
cient ﬁ nance, it provides services to the 
entire  Asia-Paciﬁ c  region.  These  ser-
vices are used by a wide range of indus-
tries, from shipping to manufacturing, 
to education, and to ﬁ nance, insurance, 
and  real  estate.  They  thrive  on  eco-
nomic density. With fewer than 5 mil-
lion  people  packed  into  less  than  700 
square  kilometers  of  space,  Singapore 
is  the  world’s  most  densely  populated 
country.  In  2006  its  exports  of  $300 
billion approached those of the Russian 
Federation,  which  has  more  than  16 
million square kilometers. Singapore’s 
diversity facilitates sharing, matching, 
and  learning,  providing  what  econo-
mists call urbanization economies. 

In most countries, such towns and cit-
ies coexist. Brazil’s Rio de Janeiro state has 
about 14.5 million people. Volta Redonda, 
not too far from Rio city, originally supplied 
goods and services just to meet the needs of 
CSN, the largest steel plant in Latin Amer-
ica. Duque de Caixas, about 15 kilometers 
from Rio, meets the needs of an industry 
producing petrochemicals. And the diversi-
ﬁ ed Rio de Janeiro metropolis, with about 
6 million people, supplies ﬁ nancial services 
to settlements that surround it. And with 
other metropolises like São Paulo, Rio con-
nects Brazil to the rest of Latin America and 
the world. The pattern is so familiar that it 
is almost a law of urban economics. 

The  functions  and  fortunes  of  settle-
ments are linked. Industrialized places are 
different from their agrarian predecessors 
not just because they are more concentrated 
but also because they are more specialized. 
The  largest  cities  may  be  well  suited  for 
startup enterprises; the smaller ones may be 
better suited for those more established. In 
agriculture, sowing and reaping must hap-
pen in the same place. Not so for industry 
and business services. Falling transport and 
communications costs allow ﬁ rms to spa-
tially  separate  sowing  and  reaping.  Prod-
ucts may be designed and ﬁ nanced in large 
cities—and produced in small towns. 

As ﬁ rms adjust to changing market con-
ditions,  places  have  to  perform  different 
functions or risk decay. The most immobile 

of  all  inputs  to  production—land—must 
become  mobile  between  uses.  Access  to 
oceans  and  rivers  might  be  the  reason  a 
place  is  settled,  but  the  nimbleness  of  its 
land  markets  will  largely  determine  how 
much it will grow. Governments may not be 
good at picking places that will prosper. But 
how well they institute regulations, build 
infrastructure, and intervene to make land 
use efﬁ cient will decide the pace of prosper-
ity for the entire neighborhood.

Depending on what type of agglomera-
tion economies they deliver, places can be 
large or small. Function is far more impor-
tant  than  size.  But  locating  farther  away 
from  economic  density  generally  reduces 
productivity.  Doubling  this  distance  in 
Brazil apparently reduces productivity by 
15 percent and proﬁ ts by 6 percent. Better 
infrastructure reduces economic distance. 
But in a developing country, the most nat-
ural way for workers and entrepreneurs to 
close this distance is to move closer. 

Migrating to proﬁ t from proximity
Agglomeration  economies  attract  people 
and ﬁ nance. Today, capital tends to move 
quickly  over  long  distances  to  exploit 
opportunities for proﬁ t. People also move, 
but  they  move  more  quickly  to  nearby 
agglomerations  than  to  those  far  away. 
Once  plants  and  people  come  to  a  place, 
others follow. 

(cid:129)  Locally, the move toward density is quick 
in  fast-growing  economies,  manifest 
in  a  rapid  rural-urban  migration  that 
accompanies the shift from agriculture to 
industry. As the Republic of Korea grew 
between 1970 and 1995, the urban share 
of population quadrupled to 82 percent, 
with migration accounting for more than 
half the increase in the 1960s and 1970s. 
(cid:129)  Nationally, workers move to reduce dis-
tance to markets in parts that are pros-
pering. About 3 million people moved 
in  the  second  half  of  the  1990s  from 
the  lagging  Indian  states  of  Bihar  and 
Uttar  Pradesh  to  leading  Maharashtra 
and prosperous Punjab (see map 5). In 
Vietnam, a much smaller country, more 
than  4  million  people  migrated  inter-
nally during the same period.

(cid:129)  Internationally,  regional  migration  is 
a  big  part  of  labor  mobility.  Migration 
among  neighbors  is  considerable.  Côte 
d’Ivoire, India, and the Islamic Republic 
of Iran have been among the top desti-
nations  for  their  neighbors.  Germany, 
Italy, and the United Kingdom still rank 

among the top 10 sending countries. But 
interregional migration is sluggish. Fewer 
than 200 million of the world’s 6.7 billion 
people live outside their region of birth. 
And  just  2  million  people  move  from 
poorer countries to the developed every 
year, half of them to the United States.

This sum is not likely to increase, even 
though  the  gains  from  greater  migration 
from developing to developed countries are 
considerable.8 International migration has 
been high in the past: fully 20 percent of 
Europeans emigrated to new lands in the 
Americas,  Australia,  and  South  Africa. 
Today, these movements have slowed. Just 
500,000 Chinese emigrated abroad in 2005. 
But internal migration has picked up in the 
developing world. More than 150 million 
people moved internally in China despite 
restrictions (see map 3). In Brazil’s high-
growth years during the 1960s and 1970s, 
almost  40  million  people  left  the  coun-
tryside for cities; even today, young work-
ers migrate in large numbers (see map 4). 
Vigorous  internal  migration  is  not  new. 
Between 1820 and 2000 per capita incomes 
in  the  United  States  multiplied  25-fold, 
and  Americans  earned  the  reputation  of 
being among the most footloose of people. 
In Japan internal migration peaked in the 
1960s,  as  it  grew  to  become  the  world’s 
 second-largest economy. 

Despite  aggressive  area  development 
policies, 1.7 million people—more women 
than  men—have  left  East  Germany  for 
the  West,  helping  to  make  incomes  more 
equal.  Since  the  transition  to  market 
economies,  ﬁ rms  and  people  have  picked 
places  better  suited  for  production.  More 
than a million people—about 12 percent of

residents—have left Siberia and the Russian 
North and Far East for the western parts of 
Russia. 

West Africa has sustained regional labor 
mobility  through  institutional  coopera-
tion.  But  independent  Africa  is  generally 
less  integrated.  Africans—especially  the 
most skilled—have been leaving the conti-
nent, seeking and getting higher rewards in 
the North. Other parts of the world show 
how to deal with this brain drain. Educated 
workers will be pulled toward places where 
other  skilled  people  agglomerate.  This  is 
beneﬁ cial for both places. But when people 
are  pushed  out  by  the  lack  of  security  or 
basic  services,  migration  is  beneﬁ cial  for 
the migrant but not always for the nation. 
Pull migration is better than push, but both 
are hard to stop or slow. Policy makers are 
realizing that the challenge is not how to 
keep people from moving, but how to keep 
them from moving for the wrong reasons. 
China illustrates the beneﬁ ts. Except for 
a brief period during the Cultural Revolu-
tion,  China  has  treated  its  diaspora  well, 
according  them  both  rights  and  respect.9 
Internally, its policies have gone back and 
forth, but now they are shifting from trying 
to discourage people from moving to deliv-
ering basic services to people wherever they 
live. The policies are paying dividends. As 
Chinese migrants are moving to the coast 
by  the  million,  many  of  the  57  million 
overseas Chinese are bringing ﬁ nance and 
expertise back to some of the same places. 
Internal  and  international  migrants  are 
coming together in a way that is not acci-
dental. The willingness of the Chinese to 
move—leaving the country for other parts 
of the world to escape war and squalor in the 
ﬁ rst part of the twentieth century and then 
bringing ﬁ nance and know-how to coastal 
China  during  the  last  quarter—promises 
to bring to southeast China a “reversal of 
fortune”  rivaling  the  U.S.  Northeast  (see 
“Geography in Motion: Overcoming Dis-
tance in North America”).

Countries  do  not  prosper  without 
mobile people. Indeed, the ability of people 
to move seems to be a good gauge of their 
economic potential, and the willingness to 
migrate  appears  to  be  a  measure  of  their 
desire  for  advancement.  Governments 

should  facilitate  labor  mobility.  For 
decades since independence, India treated 
its  40  million  emigrants  as  “not  required 
Indians.” Encouraged by a change in atti-
tude since the 1990s, expatriate Indians are 
pulling  distant  places  like  Bangalore  and 
Hyderabad closer to world markets, just as 
the overseas Chinese did for Shanghai and 
Guangzhou  more  than  a  decade  earlier. 
Falling costs of transport and communica-
tions have helped greatly.

Specializing and trading as transport 
costs fall
Transport and communication costs have 
indeed fallen rapidly over the last century, 
especially  in  the  last  50  years.  Since  the 
1970s,  railroad  freight  costs  are  down  by 
half. Road transport costs, despite higher 
energy and wage costs, are down by about 
40 percent. For worldwide air freight, the 
price has fallen to about 6 percent of its 1955 
level. The price for tramp shipping services 
is half that in 1960. A three-minute phone 
call from New York to London was almost 
$300 in 1931. Today, the same call can be 
made for just a few cents.

With  falling  domestic  transport  costs, 
economic production should have become 
more evenly spread within countries. With 
lower  costs  of  transporting  and  commu-
nicating internationally, countries should 
have  traded  more  with  distant  partners. 
What happened was the opposite. Falling 
transport costs have coincided with greater 
economic concentration within countries. 
And while countries now trade more with 
everyone—exports as a share of world pro-
duction quadrupled to 25 percent over the 
last  three  decades—trade  with  neighbors 
became even more important. 

Why did this happen? The answer lies in 
the growing importance of scale economies 
in  production  and  transport  (see  chapter 
6). As transport costs have fallen, they have 
allowed greater specialization and radically 
altered the location of ﬁ rms and the nature 
of trade. With high transport costs, ﬁ rms 
had to be near consumers. But as transport 
costs fall, they can avail of internal, local, 
and urban economies of scale, and trans-
port the product to consumers. Internation-
ally, the same thing. With high transport

costs, England imported only what it could 
not grow or produce at reasonable cost—
spices from India and beef from Argentina 
in exchange for British textiles and china. 
As  transport  costs  fell,  it  imported  more 
spices and beef. But it also traded more with 
France and Germany—Scotch whisky for 
French wine, English ale for German beer. 
Trade to fulﬁ ll basic needs was joined and 
soon overtaken by trade to satisfy a variety 
of wants. 

Falling costs of transportation and com-
munication have made the world smaller. 
But they have also made economic activity 
more geographically concentrated.

(cid:129)  Locally,  with  falling  costs  of  commut-
ing  and  a  greater  potential  for  exploit-
ing scale economies, towns and cities can 
grow bigger and denser. 

(cid:129)  Nationally, as leading and lagging areas 
within countries are connected through 
better  modes  of  transport,  production 
is more concentrated in the more eco-
nomically dense areas to take advantage 
of agglomeration economies.

(cid:129)  Internationally,  countries  that  have 
lowered  the  costs  of  transport  more 
have beneﬁ ted most from greater trade. 
Greater  specialization  has  made  these 
countries  more  competitive  still,  con-
centrating  trade  and  wealth  in  a  few 
parts of the world. 

Scale economies are evident in the trans-
port  sector,  too.  More  trade  means  lower 
costs  of  transportation,  which  in  turn 
means more trade. This is especially true 
for intraindustry trade, which has been the 
most rapidly growing part of international 
trade  during  the  last  half-century.  Since 
1960 the share of intraindustry trade in the 
world’s total has doubled from 27 percent 
to 54 percent. Within-region intraindustry 
trade is low in most regions, and high in a 
few.  It  is  close  to  zero  for  Central  Africa, 
Central Asia, East Africa, Northern Africa, 
South Asia, and Southern Africa. It is high-
est for Australia, East Asia, New Zealand, 
North America, and Western Europe (see 
ﬁ gure 4).

Regional  cooperation  has  advanced 
much faster and further in these parts of the

world, explaining why the friction of bor-
ders on trade has fallen. Aided by a deep-
ening  integration,  the  intraregional  share 
of trade in the EU has risen above 60 per-
cent (see “Geography in Motion: Overcom-
ing Division in Western Europe”). In East 
Asia, the fastest-growing region, the share of 
regional trade is now more than 55 percent 
(see “Geography in Motion: Distance and 
Division in East Asia”).

Development in a world of greater spe-
cialization and concentration is even more 
challenging.  Developing  countries  have 
higher transport costs and small markets, 
which  do  not  support  specialization.  But 
several countries—mainly in East Asia—
have shown that these markets are acces-
sible for low-income countries. The answer 
lies  in  the  fastest-growing  component  of 
intraindustry trade: trade in “intermediate 
inputs” of production (see box 3). 

In  agriculture,  industry,  and  services, 
the  potential  for  fragmenting  production 
is almost without limit. Thailand may not

BOX 3    Intraindustry trade and intermediate inputs

More than half of world trade today is 
intraindustry trade, with industries clas-
sifi ed in 177 (3-digit) categories, up from 
about a quarter in 1962. So countries 
are becoming more similar in their eco-
nomic structures. This trade consists of 

fi nal and intermediate goods, with both 
having increased considerably over the 
last 50 years. This rise in intraindustry 
trade is not just for manufacturing. Intra-
industry trade in machines and transport 
equipment is the highest, but the larg-

est increase is in food and live animals. 
Consumers like variety for farm produce, 
and that means profi t in trade between 
two countries that raise similar food and 
animals (see fi gure at left).

But the largest rise is for intermediate 
inputs—the produced means of produc-
tion. Marginal intraindustry trade—a 
reliable measure of change—is highest 
in intermediate inputs. This is not just for 
manufacturing. Agriculture needs inputs, 
too. And falling communications costs 
have resulted in greater fragmentation 
of services into “components,” supplied 
to fi nal consumers from diff erent parts of 
the world. 

Trade in intermediate goods is more 

sensitive to transport costs than is trade 
in fi nal goods. Consider the following 
illustration: if intermediate inputs are 
two-thirds of the value added for a good, 
a 5-percent increase in transport costs 
can mean the equivalent of a 50-percent 
tax. Little wonder that intermediate 
goods trade has increased fastest in parts 
of the world that have reduced trade and 
transport costs the most.

equally well and much cheaper. Anchored 
by China and Japan, countries in East Asia 
have developed production networks that 
trade  intermediate  goods  back  and  forth. 
By specializing in a small part of the pro-
duction chain, they have broken into this 
most lucrative and fastest-growing compo-
nent of trade in manufactures. 

Countries  in  other  regions  can  also 
beneﬁ t from the growing trade in inter-
mediate goods. The key for most is mak-
ing a concerted effort to lower the costs of 
transport.  This  means  more  concentra-
tion within developing countries, but—by 
allowing them to specialize at earlier stages 
of development and exploit economies of 
scale—it  will  help  them  converge  to  the 
incomes and living standards in the devel-
oped  world.  Over  the  last  two  decades, 
such  interactions  between  scale  econo-
mies,  mobility  of  capital  and  labor,  and 

transport costs have occupied the interest 
of researchers (see box 4). 

Their  insights  should  change  what  to 
expect from the markets. They should also 
inform what governments can do to pro-
mote the geographic transformations nec-
essary for development. 

Putting development in place
Prosperity will not come to every place at 
once, but no place should remain mired in 
poverty.  With  good  policies,  the  concen-
tration of economic activity and the con-
vergence  of  living  standards  can  happen 
together. The challenge for governments is 
to allow—even encourage—“unbalanced” 
economic growth, and yet ensure inclusive 
development.  They  can  do  this  through 
economic  integration—by  bringing  lag-
ging and leading places closer in economic 
terms.

BOX 4    New insights from a generation of analysis

Researchers have been taking a fresh 
look at industrial organization, eco-
nomic growth, international trade, and 
economic geography, having incorpo-
rated the eff ects of scale economies in 
production. The results can be surpris-
ing for those schooled in conventional 
economic analysis. Here are some of the 
new insights:

Plants have to be big to exploit econ-
omies of scale, but places do not have 
to be big to generate them. Increasing 
returns to scale arise because of fi xed 
costs of production (internal to a fi rm) 
and proximity to workers, customers, 
and people with new ideas (external to a 
fi rm, even an industry). The size of settle-
ments matters less than their function.  
The reason: with reasonable transport 

costs, towns can be large enough to 
facilitate internal scale economies. Medi-
um-size cities are often large enough for 
“localization” economies that come from 

thick input markets, but not for “urban-
ization” economies—especially those 
involving knowledge spillovers—gener-
ated mainly by large cities (see chapter 4). 

The implication: policy makers should 

focus on the functions of cities. 

Human capital moves to where it is 

abundant, not scant. Conventional eco-
nomic analysis implies that people should 
move to where their skills are scant. But 
the opposite seems to happen: educated 
migrants seek places where many others 
have similar skills. Among the 100 largest 
metropolitan areas in the United States, 
the 25 cities with the highest share of 
college graduates in 1990 had, by 2000, 
attracted graduates at twice the rate of the 
other 75. 

The reason: educated workers gain 

from proximity to others (see chapter 5). 

The implication: policies should not 
fi ght the market force that pulls skilled 
people together. 

Falling transport costs increase trade 

more with neighboring, not distant, 
countries. With a decline in transport costs, 
countries should trade more with countries 
that are farther away. But trade has become 
more localized than globalized. Countries 
trade more with countries that are similar, 
because increasingly the basis of trade is 
the exploitation of economies of scale, not 
the diff erences in natural endowments. 

The reason: falling transport costs make 

specialization possible (see chapter 6). 

The implication: falling transport costs 
change the composition of international 
trade and make it even more sensitive to 
such costs. Policies to reduce trade and 
transport costs should be a big part of 
growth strategies for late developers.

Recognizing scale economies and their 

interaction with the mobility of people and 
products implies changing long-held views 
about what is needed for economic growth.

This  integration  can  best  be  done  by 
unleashing  the  market  forces  of  agglom-
eration, migration, and specialization, not 
by  ﬁ ghting  or  opposing  them.  How  well 
markets  and  governments  work  together 
determines the speed and sustainability of 
geographic transformations. Look at what 
is happening in Bogotá, Turkey, and West 
Africa:

(cid:129)  Bogotá has almost 7 million citizens, but 
migration from rural Colombia contin-
ues. A third of its population growth is 
due to rural migrants, who mostly settle 
in poor, crowded neighborhoods as the 
city grows denser. Since 2000 a new public 
transportation system, the TransMilenio, 
has  eased  congestion,  now  carrying  a 
million passengers a month. For the poor 
neighborhoods especially, it has reduced 
the distance to economic opportunities. 
But many people still live in slums, and 
crime  and  violence  are  getting  worse. 
A  municipal  initiative  has  addressed 
these social divisions since 2003, helping 
almost a million people integrate into the 
city and change their neighborhoods.

(cid:129)  Turkey  is  trying  to  change  neighbor-
hoods  too,  in  a  different  way.  The 
country of 70 million has been looking 
toward integration with the EU. Because 
of higher agglomeration economies and 
lower transport costs, areas near Istanbul 
and Izmir may be better suited for inte-
grating with Europe. The more distant 
areas of eastern and southeastern Anato-
lia and the Black Sea have 40 percent of 
the land but less than 20 percent of the 
national product, with a GDP per capita 
about half that of the western areas. The 
disparities  persist  despite  government 
efforts to spread economic mass toward 
the east. Meanwhile, public investments 
in  social  services  help  lagging  areas, 
while ﬁ scal incentives for ﬁ rms to locate 
in those areas seem ineffective.10

(cid:129)  The Economic Community of West Afri-
can States (ECOWAS) has a protocol that 
allows free movement of its 250 million 
people  between  member  states.  This 
has  helped  the  neighborhood  maintain 
regional  labor  mobility  at  preindepen-
dence  levels,  even  as  it  fell  in  East  and 
Southern  Africa.  But  trade  is  another

story. In the most dynamic parts of the 
world, the exchange of similar goods and 
services—intraindustry trade—has been 
rising rapidly. But in West Africa, inter-
national borders are thickened by red tape 
and illicit checkpoints, which divide the 
region and thwart the efforts of ECOWAS 
members to specialize and trade. 

As  the  lens  of  economic  geography  is 
widened,  different  movements,  stresses, 
and strains come into view. 

(cid:129)  Locally, in places like Bogotá, land must 
accommodate  more  and  more  people. 
If land markets work well, land will be 
mobile between uses and allocated pro-
ductively.  The  cities  that  do  this  best 
will grow, and even more people will be 
attracted to their economic density.

(cid:129)  People and products move much faster 
in and around Bogotá than they do in 
Turkey. But even in Turkey, the western 
areas will become more prosperous and 
dense,  if  at  a  slower  pace.  Spatial  dis-
parities  in  incomes  and  poverty  rates 
between the west and the east will likely 
rise and then diminish as people move 
to take advantage of economic density. If 
labor markets in Turkey are ﬂ uid, peo-
ple will reduce their economic distance 
to these agglomerations.

(cid:129)  Internationally,  these  movements  are 
likely  to  be  fewer  and  even  slower.  If 
regional and global markets were inte-
grated, countries in West Africa would 
specialize  in  a  few  tasks  and  become 
competitive in world markets. As divi-
sions  diminish,  neighboring  countries

trade similar goods and services, moti-
vated  more  by  the  beneﬁ ts  of  special-
ization and scale than by differences in 
natural  endowments.  Trade  can  only 
partially  offset  the  immobility  of  land 
and labor, but it will help convergence 
when developing countries can tap into 
the  most  rapidly  growing  component: 
trade in intermediate goods.

Private  motives  are  the  main  shapers 
of  the  economic  landscape,  but  it  can  be 
reshaped by collective action, most potently 
by governments. Seen through the lens of 
economic geography, land use, labor mobil-
ity, and intermediate goods trade come into 
focus (see table 2). Governments should pay 
special attention to land, labor, and product 
markets. When they do not work well, the 
forces  of  agglomeration,  migration,  and 
specialization  weaken,  and  the  economy 
stagnates. When they do, land, labor, and 
input markets bring the economic efﬁ ciency 
that comes with geographic concentration, 
and the equity associated with converging 
living standards. 

A rule of thumb for economic 
integration
The concern of policy makers is that pro-
duction  will  concentrate  in  some  places, 
people in others. Cities will have economic 
density,  and  the  countryside  most  of  the 
poor. Leading areas will have the economic 
mass, while the poor are massed in lagging 
areas. Some countries will have much of the 
world’s wealth, others most of the world’s 
poor. Even if this were temporary, it seems 
unfair. But the disparities may be long last-
ing, destabilizing parts of a country, entire 
nations, and even some world regions. 

Governments  have  many  reasons  to 
worry  about  disparities  in  welfare  in  and 
among countries. They also have many pol-
icy  instruments  for  promoting  economic 
integration to reduce those disparities.

include  slum  clearance  programs,  ﬁ s-
cal incentives for manufacturing ﬁ rms 
offered by state governments, and pref-
erential trade access for poor countries 
in developed country markets.

Today, policy debates often begin and 
end with discussions of spatially targeted 
incentives.  The  debate  on  how  to  pro-
mote  healthy  urbanization  is  polarized 
between  those  who  emphasize  villages, 
where a majority of the world’s poor still 
live, and those who believe the way out of 
poverty  lies  in  cities,  where  much  of  the 
world’s wealth is generated. As urban pov-
erty increases, the focus is shifting from 
villages  to  slums.  Motivated  by  within-
country  geographic  disparities  in  living 
standards, the debate on territorial devel-
opment  is  similarly  ﬁ xated  on  economic 
growth  in  lagging  areas.  At  the  interna-
tional level, preferential market access for 

the least developed countries can end up 
dominating policy discussions. 

This  Report  calls  for  a  rebalancing  of 
these  debates  to  include  all  the  elements 
of  a  successful  approach  to  spatial  inte-
gration—institutions, infrastructure, and 
incentives. Using the ﬁ ndings in part one 
and  the  analysis  of  market  forces  in  part 
two,  part  three  reframes  these  debates, 
calling for a shift from spatial targeting to 
spatial integration.

The world is complicated, and the prob-
lems  of  economic  integration  defy  simple 
solutions.  But  the  principles  need  not  be 
complex. The bedrock of integration poli-
cies should be spatially blind institutions. 
Where the integration challenge spans more 
than one geographic dimension, institutions 
must be augmented by public investments 
in spatially connective infrastructure. Spa-
tially targeted interventions are not always 
necessary.  But  where  the  problem  is  low 
economic density, long distances, and high 
divisions, the response must be comprehen-
sive, involving spatially blind, connective, 
and targeted policies. 

For each spatial dimension, an instru-
ment of integration (see table 3). The rule 
of thumb: “an I for a D.”

(cid:129)  For  a  one-dimensional  problem,  the 
mainstay of the policy response should 
be (spatially blind) institutions. 

(cid:129)  For a two-dimensional challenge, both 
institutions  and  (spatially  connective) 
infrastructure are needed.

(cid:129)  For  a  three-dimensional  predicament, 
all  three  instruments  are  needed—in-
stitutions, infrastructure, and (spatially 
targeted) interventions. 

The  primary  dimension  at  the  local 
geographic  scale  is  density;  nationally,  it 
is  distance;  internationally,  division.  At 
each  of  these  geographic  scales,  policies 
designed without explicit consideration to 
space should be seen as the primary instru-
ment. In some places, these can be a large 
part  of  integration  policies.  The  task  of 
integration is relatively straightforward in 
areas of incipient urbanization (as in lag-
ging states in many low-income countries), 
in countries with mobile labor and capital 
(such as Chile), or in regions that are close 
to  world  markets  (such  as  North  Africa). 
In  such  places,  the  integration  challenge 
can be seen as one dimensional. Explicitly 
spatial policies are not generally necessary. 
Universal or spatially blind institutions—
made  available  to  everyone  regardless  of 
location—form both the bedrock and the 
mainstay of an effective integration policy. 
As the task becomes more complicated, 
these  institutions  must  be  assisted  by 
infrastructure. Locally, rapid urbanization 
can congest the area, increasing economic 
distance  and  choking  off  agglomeration 
economies.  In  places  such  as  Mumbai, 
whose  population  has  doubled  since  the 
1970s, rising congestion has to be met by 
investments  in  transport  infrastructure, 
so that the beneﬁ ts of density are shared 
more  widely.  Nationally,  changing  eco-
nomic  and  political  fortunes  can  leave

behind a misplaced density of populations 
in lagging areas, so that in some countries 
(such as Brazil) lagging areas have higher 
poverty rates and high population densi-
ties.  Internationally,  developing  regions 
are all deeply divided, but some also may 
be  distant  from  world  markets.  Even  if 
regional institutions take hold and make 
South Asia a more integrated region, some 
countries (such as Nepal) may need con-
certed policy action to improve the infra-
structure  to  reach  growing  regional  and 
international  markets.  For  places  that 
face  two-dimensioned  integration  chal-
lenges, investments in infrastructure that 
connects  lagging  to  leading  places  and 
aid market access should supplement the 
institutions that bring people together. 

The integration challenge is greatest where 
adverse density, distance, and division com-
bine to pose a “three-dimensional challenge.” 
In highly urbanized areas (such as Bogotá), 
the fear is that economic density and popu-
lation density may not coincide. Within-city 
divisions may prevent the integration of slums 
and spawn problems of crime and grime. In 
some countries (such as India), ethnic, reli-
gious, or linguistic divisions discourage the 
poor in densely populated lagging areas from 
seeking their fortunes elsewhere. And in the 
most fragmented and remote regions (such as 
Central Africa or Central Asia), a clustering 
of small and poor nations can lead to spill-
overs of the wrong kind—disease, conﬂ ict, 
or corruption. 

Slums in large cities, densely populated 
poor areas in divided nations, and the “bot-
tom billion” countries—approximating the 
three billions discussed at the beginning—
are the most difﬁ cult challenges for inte-
gration. The policy responses should not be 
timid. But they should also be deliberate. 

Efﬁ cient and inclusive urbanization
No  country  has  grown  to  middle  income 
without  industrializing  and  urbanizing. 
None  has  grown  to  high  income  without 
vibrant cities. The rush to cities in develop-
ing  countries  seems  chaotic,  but  it  is  nec-
essary.  It  seems  unprecedented,  but  it  has 
happened  before  (see  ﬁ gure  5).  It  had  to 
have,  because  the  move  to  density  that  is 
manifest  in  urbanization  is  closely  related

to the transformation of an economy from 
agrarian to industrial to postindustrial. 

Governments  can  facilitate  the  spatial 
transformations that lie behind these sec-
toral  changes.  Depending  on  the  stage  of 
urbanization,  sequencing  and  priority-
 setting require paying attention to different 
aspects of the geographic transformation. 
What does not change is that a foundation 
of institutions must be universal and come 
ﬁ rst, investments in connective infrastruc-
ture should be both timed and located well 
and  come  second,  and  spatially  targeted 
interventions should be used least and last. 
The approach requires the discipline of 
following the integration principle set out 
earlier. The payoff is a spatial transforma-
tion that is both efﬁ cient and inclusive (see 
chapter 7). 

The  principles  outlined  in  the  Report 
help to prioritize policies for different stages 
of  urbanization,  providing  the  elements 
of  an  urbanization  strategy.  Map  6  shows 
three  areas  in  Colombia,  each  with  a  spe-
ciﬁ c geography. But the principles are quite 
universal. 

(cid:129)  Incipient  urbanization.  In  places  that 
are  mostly  rural,  governments  should 
be  as  neutral  as  possible  and  should 

establish  the  institutional  foundation 
of possible urbanization in some places. 
Good  land  policies  are  central,  and  so 
are  policies  to  provide  basic  services 
to  everyone.  For  example,  the  univer-
salization  of  land  rights  in  Denmark 
at  the  turn  of  the  eighteenth  century 
contributed greatly to the nation’s take-
off into industrialization a few decades 
later. Indeed, policies to strengthen rural 
property rights are seen as instrumental 
for  higher  agricultural  productivity  in 
sixteenth-century England, which freed 
workers  to  migrate  to  towns  to  work 
in manufacturing and services. A close 
complement to the institutions for bet-
ter land markets is the universal provi-
sion  of  basic  social  services—security, 
education,  health  services,  and  sanita-
tion. In 1960, the Republic of Korea had 
a per capita income level that Benin has 
today. Seventy-ﬁ ve percent of its people 
lived  in  rural  areas,  more  than  a  third 
of Korean adults had no schooling, and 
fewer  than  5  percent  of  children  had 
been  immunized  against  preventable 
diseases such as measles. By 2000, more 
than 80 percent had urbanized, almost 
everyone  was  literate  and  immunized, 
and the Republic of Korea’s income had

BOX 5     Concentration without congestion in western 

China: Chongqing and Chengdu

An experiment in China might change 
the future of urbanization policy in 
the developing world. Policy makers 
should take notice. 

China is taking inland the urbaniza-

tion strategy that was successful in 
the leading coastal areas in the 1980s 
and 1990s. The “area approach” is 
being implemented in two places— 
Chongqing and Chengdu, both 
located in the near west. At about 40 
percent, they have the same urbaniza-
tion ratio as the average for China. The 
aim is to increase that to 70 percent by 
2020, promoting both concentration 
and rural-urban convergence. 

Chongqing has a population of 

about 40 million, with a portfolio of 
a capital city, six large cities, 25 small 
and mid-size cities, 95 central town-
ships, and 400 townships.  Chongqing 
has been accorded the status of 
a special municipality, as Beijing, 
Shanghai, and Tianjin have had for 
some years. Like them, it will enjoy 
greater fi nancial autonomy. Chengdu 
is smaller, a sprawling metropolitan 
area with 11 million people. Along 
with the 2,000-year-old capital city of 
Sichuan province, it has eight medi-
um-size cities, 30 central townships, 
60 townships, and 600 villages. 

The urbanization strategy involves 

“three concentrations” of land, 
industry, and farmers. The idea is to 
reap the benefi ts of scale economies, 
promote the mobility of goods and 
workers, and improve the well-being 
of new migrants to cities. Consistent 
with the policy priorities outlined for 
areas with intermediate urban shares 
of about 40–50 percent, the emphasis 
in both places is on universal institu-
tions and connective infrastructure, 
not spatially targeted interventions. 

Better institutions. The emphasis 

is on coordination across government 
levels to manage land use and con-
version. In the countryside, the plan 
concentrates rural land by transfer-
ring use rights to fi rms and farmers. 
In towns and cities, the creation of 
industrial zones is a key part of the 
wider framework. Large and medium 
cities are developing high value-
added manufacturing, while smaller 
cities and towns are specializing in 
labor-intensive industries, pulling in 
labor from nearby villages, and facili-
tating localization economies. 

More infrastructure. Massive trunk 
infrastructure is planned. Chongqing 
will spend billions on infrastructure, 
from the central government and 
through increased private invest-
ment from Hong Kong, China, and 
from Singapore. In Chengdu, about 
117 billion yuan will be invested in 
71 infrastructure projects, including 
rural-urban transport networks, and 
water and sanitation projects in both 
rural and urban areas. Another 16.5 
billion yuan will be invested in 34 
social projects to improve the living 
standards of lagging rural residents. 
If markets favor the two places as 
much as the government has, they 
will improve the lives of millions in 
the Chinese hinterland. The integra-
tion already has had a local impact. 
In Chongqing, rural incomes in 2007 
increased faster than those of urban 
residents. In Chengdu, farmer con-
centrations are believed to have led 
to a productivity increase of 80 per-
cent, as industry has been absorbing 
about 100,000 farmers a year.

reached  that  of  modern-day  Portugal. 
Another good example is Costa Rica. 

(cid:129)  Intermediate  urbanization.  In  places 
where  urbanization  has  picked  up 
speed, in addition to these institutions, 
governments must put in place connec-
tive  infrastructure  so  that  the  beneﬁ ts 

of  rising  economic  density  are  more 
widely shared. Industrialization involves 
changing land use patterns as activities 
concentrate, and requires moving goods 
and services around quickly. Land use 
regulations can affect location decisions, 
and they continue to be the institutional 
priority.  Spatially  blind  social  services 
should continue as part of rural-urban 
integration, so that people are pulled to 
cities by agglomeration economies, not 
pushed out by the lack of schools, health 
services,  and  public  security  in  rural 
areas. But even if these services are pro-
vided,  transport  costs  can  rise  quickly 
because of growing congestion, affecting 
the  location  choices  of  entrepreneurs. 
Connective infrastructure is needed to 
keep such areas integrated. State and cen-
tral governments that work well together 
can  provide  the  trunk  infrastructure 
necessary  to  ensure  that  prosperity  is 
widely shared. Making the administra-
tive jurisdiction wider can help in coor-
dinating infrastructure investments. A 
good example is  Chongqing in western 
China (see box 5). 

(cid:129)  Advanced urbanization. In highly urban-
ized areas, besides institutions and infra-
structure, targeted interventions may be 
necessary  to  deal  with  the  problem  of 
slums. Services and learning require peo-
ple to be in proximity to livable surround-
ings. This is the stage in which slums can 
compromise a city’s ability to deliver the 
economies  that  come  from  proximity. 
Slum- improvement  programs  may  not 
be a priority at earlier stages of urbaniza-
tion, but at this stage they become nec-
essary.  The  lesson  from  assessments  of 
slum-improvement initiatives is that tar-
geted  interventions  will  not  be  enough 
by themselves. These interventions will 
not  work  unless  institutions  related  to 
land  and  basic  services  are  reasonably 
effective, and transport infrastructure is 
in place. A three-dimensional challenge 
must be met by a three-pronged policy 
response, requiring coordinated policies 
at the central, state, and city levels of gov-
ernment.  Singapore’s success shows the 
advantages of such coordination in a city-
state. More recent examples are Shanghai

and Guangzhou in China. An even more 
recent (and perhaps more generally appli-
cable) example is Bogotá in Colombia. 

The  experience  of  successful  urban-
izers indicates that the basis of successful 
rural-urban transformations is a set of spa-
tially blind policies—“institutions” in the 
shorthand  of  this  Report.  Investments  in 
infrastructure  that  connects  places  form 
the  second  tier.  Geographically  targeted 
interventions should be used only when the 
challenge is especially difﬁ cult, but should 
always be used together with an effort to 
improve institutions and infrastructure. 

Area (territorial) development policies 
that integrate nations
Some parts of a country are better suited 
for  agriculture,  others  for  industry,  and 
still  others  for  services.  And  as  industry 
and services ﬂ ourish, the spatial distribu-
tion of economic activities must change.11 
No  country  has  grown  to  riches  without 
changing the geographic distribution of its 
people and production.

A  rising  concentration  of  people  and 
production in some parts of a country has 
marked  economic  growth  over  the  last 
two centuries. To ﬁ ght this concentration 
is to ﬁ ght growth itself, and policy makers 
must show patience in dealing with these 
imbalances. But aided by government poli-
cies, successful development also has been 
marked by falling disparities in living stan-
dards  between  places  favored  by  markets 
and those less fortunate. Policies can speed 
up  the  convergence  in  basic  living  stan-
dards, so that people in the least-fortunate 
places do not have to wait for basic public 
amenities  until  their  nations  reach  high 
income levels. The experience of success-
ful developers also justiﬁ es impatience in 
equalizing basic living standards.

Consider  Malaysia.  Economic  growth 
and  government  policies  have  reduced 
poverty  and  improved  living  standards, 
speeding progress toward meeting the Mil-
lennium  Development  Goals.  But  in  the 
early  years  of  growth  (between  1970  and 
1976), poverty rates between different states 
diverged  brieﬂ y,  to  later  converge  as  they 
declined for all states (see ﬁ gure 6). Health 
indicators (infant mortality) declined more

in the slower-growing states, implying that 
tax and transfer mechanisms worked well. 
Such  impatience  with  spatial  inequality 
in  living  standards  is  paying  off  in  other 
countries such as China, Egypt, Indonesia, 
Mexico, Thailand, and Vietnam. 

But  not  all  countries  have  experienced 
geographic convergence in the Millennium 
Development Indicators, such as child mor-
tality, maternal health, basic education, safe 
water, and sanitation. What should they do? 
The answer lies in integrating lagging and 
leading areas, using policies that are tailored 
to the level of difﬁ culty of integration. While 
economic motives are important, social and 
political  conditions  inﬂ uence  the  speed  of 
these  spatial  changes.  The  location  choices 
that  people  make  reﬂ ect  the  strengths  and 
inclinations of societies and political struc-
tures.  Poverty  maps  provide  a  snapshot  of 
where the poor are concentrated (high pov-
erty mass—that is, the “poor people”), and 
which places are the poorest (high poverty 
rate—that is, the “poor places”). These maps 
can tell us a lot about the social and politi-
cal conditions in a country: the movement of 
poor people may best reﬂ ect the constraints to 
mobility, because they have the most reason 
to move and the fewest resources to do so. 

Using information on where poor people 
are located and which places are poor, the 
policy response can be calibrated to coun-
try conditions.

are in the western provinces, but the poor 
are concentrated in the southeast and cen-
tral areas (see map 7, panel a). Economic 
density  and  population  density  overlap. 
The country has few divisions—linguistic 
and other barriers are not high—and peo-
ple, including the poor, can move to reduce 
their  distance  to  density.  Spatially  blind 
institutions  that  ensure  well-functioning 
land markets, enforce property rights, and 
deliver basic social services such as school-
ing and health care can be the mainstay of 
an economic integration strategy to reduce 
the  economic  distance  between  lagging 
and leading areas. Chile, Egypt, Honduras, 
Indonesia,  Russia,  Uganda,  and Vietnam 
are other examples of countries where the 
area development challenge is unidimen-
sional—the main problem is distance.

(cid:129)  Undivided countries with densely popu-
lated lagging areas. In Brazil the poverty 
rates are highest in the north and north-
east: eight of the ten poorest states are in 
the  northeast,  the  other  two  are  in  the 
north (see map 7, panel b). But the eco-
nomic  mass  and  the  concentration  of 
poverty are highest in the urban agglom-
erations  near  the  coast,  from  the  poor 
northeast to the thriving southeast. Eco-
nomic and population densities coincide 
only partially. The poverty-related symp-
toms are those of a country where within-
 country divisions such as ethnolinguistic 
differences  and  political  fragmentation 
are low, but where population densities 
are—for  historical  and  policy-related 
reasons—in the “wrong places.” Bangla-
desh, Colombia, Ghana, and Turkey have 
similar  conditions.  In  such  places  the 
pull of agglomeration economies in lead-
ing areas and the mobility of labor may 
not be strong enough to induce concen-
tration and convergence. The problems 
of  “long  distance  and  wrong  density” 
must  be  met  by  a  two-pronged  policy 
of economic integration: spatially blind 
institutions should be augmented by spa-
tially connective infrastructure, such as 
interregional highways and railroads and 
improved telecommunications.

(cid:129)  Divided  countries  with  densely  popu-
lated lagging areas. In India more than 
400 million people live in the central lag-

ging states, home to more than 60 percent 
of the nation’s poor (see map 7, panel c). 
People live there for a reason: it is a fer-
tile  plain  and  was  the  cradle  of  Indian 
civilization. But their location is less for-
tunate  now,  as  the  world  has  changed. 
Labor mobility is limited because of lin-
guistic and class divisions. Mobility has 
not been helped by policies that sought to 
revive growth in these lagging provinces 
through subsidized ﬁ nance and preferen-
tial industrial licensing. The debate is now 
shifting toward economic integration—
policies more consistent with mobility of 
labor such as interregional infrastructure 
and better health and education services. 
These policies and the interstate migra-
tion they encourage will, if given time, 
reduce the divisions that have made the 
distances  long  between  leading  areas 
and  densely  populated  lagging  areas. 
In the meantime, these areas may need 
a  helping  hand—from  geographically 
targeted incentives that encourage local 
production.  Another  country  with  a 
three-dimensional integration agenda of 
distance, densely populated poor areas, 
and domestic divisions may be Nigeria. 
In such places, the policy response has to 
be a blend of spatially blind, connective, 
and targeted policies. 

Governments  should  not  be  faulted 
for  being  impatient  with  markets,  and 
for  trying  to  help  lagging  areas.  But  tar-
geted interventions should be designed to 
work  with  the  institutional  reforms  and 
the  investments  in  infrastructure.  Expe-
rience suggests that incentives should not 
be  provided  for  activities  that  depend  on 
agglomeration economies or international 
market  access.  Incentives  for  agriculture 
are prime candidates in these largely rural 
and agrarian areas. Relying mainly on tar-
geted  incentives  for  industry—as  India 
did for decades—will not help the lagging 
states improve living standards to levels in 
the leading states. 

Regional integration to increase access 
to global markets
The merits of global versus regional trade 
agreements  have  been  debated  for  years. 
The debate is now largely concluded. Where

regional or bilateral pacts do not discourage 
trade with countries in other regions, and 
where they are accompanied by measures 
to facilitate the ﬂ ows of goods, people, and 
ﬁ nance—such as infrastructure and com-
pensatory  mechanisms—they  can  help. 
Otherwise, they are not worth the trouble. 
This  Report  does  not  reopen  that 
debate.  Instead,  it  takes  up  the  question 
of how developing countries can best gain 
access to markets within their neighbor-
hoods  and  across  the  world.  Geography 
matters greatly in deciding what is needed, 
what is unnecessary, and what will fail. But 
with the right mix of policy actions, even 
countries in parts of the world that have 
been  left  far  behind  can  overcome  their 
geographic disadvantage. The way to tell if 
the actions are paying dividends is whether 
market access improves noticeably. 

Some  regions  of  the  world  have  done 
better than others (see ﬁ gure 7). Countries 
in  these  regions  now  have  thinner  eco-
nomic borders (see map 8, panel a). They 
can  afford  to  have  thin  borders,  because 
their  neighbors  are  prospering  too.  For 
them, regional markets are world markets. 
Others, like the East Asians, have allowed 
production  relationships  to  grow  strong 
and cut paths even through thick borders. 
But specializing can increase efﬁ ciency only 

if the scale of production is big, and that 
requires  reaching  the  big  markets  of  the 
Northern Hemisphere. 

What  do  late  developers  have  to  do  to 
accelerate development? The common con-
dition  is  division—that  is,  thick  borders. 
What  differs  is  their  distance  from  large 
world markets and whether or not there is 
a large country in their neighborhood (see 
map 8, panel b). 

(cid:129)  Countries  in  regions  near  large  world 
markets. For countries near large mar-
kets, regional and global integration does 
not  require  geographic  differentiation. 
Spatially blind measures such as improv-
ing  economic  policies  and  the  invest-
ment  climate  will  attract  capital  and 
technology from the more sophisticated 
markets nearby. Their underused talent 
and  cheaper  labor  are  powerful  draws. 
Whether  they  lag  or  lead  within  the 
region is hardly relevant; the presence of 
a sun nearby makes them all small plan-
ets. Mexican exports to the United States 
are about 1.7 percent of the U.S. econ-
omy.  Mexico  should  build  even  stron-
ger links with the United States. But for 
other countries in Central America, the 
payoffs to infrastructure connections to 
Mexico are small—the market in North 
America dwarfs all of Central America’s. 
And market access likely depends most 
on  economic  stability.  Spatially  blind 
institutions  should  be  able  to  integrate 
Central  America  with  world  markets. 
The same is true for Eastern Europe and 
North Africa. Countries in these regions 
have better-than-average market access, 
though  depending  on  their  economic 
policies  and  regulations,  this  access  is 
not  uniform  even  within  these  regions 
(see map 8, panel c).

(cid:129)  Countries  in  regions  distant  from 
large world markets that have a large 
economy.  To  integrate  regions  more 
distant  from  large  world  markets  but 
with  a  sizable  economy—East  Asia, 
Latin  America,  Southern  Africa,  and 
South Asia—such spatially blind mea-
sures are just as necessary, but they may 
not be sufﬁ cient. For lagging countries 
in  these  regions,  such  as  Mongolia,

Nepal, Paraguay, and Zimbabwe, some 
of the paths to world markets may go 
through their larger neighbors. Brazil, 
China, and India are attractive to inves-
tors because of their potential market 
size, and these “home market effects” 
can  generate  the  impetus  for  special-
ization and help their enterprises com-
pete in world markets. A qualiﬁ cation: 
for market access, the relevant measure 
of distance is economic, not Euclidean. 
With a combination of bilateral accords, 
inspired transport policies, and aggres-
sive specialization in primary products, 
Chile reduced distance to North Amer-
ica and built global rather than regional 
links. But such cases are exceptions. For 
the smaller countries in these regions, 
both institutional reforms and regional 
connectivity will be necessary for eco-
nomic integration. 

(cid:129)  Countries in regions distant from world 
markets without large economies. The 
most  difﬁ cult  challenges  are  for  the 
countries in parts of the world divided 
by  thick  borders,  distant  from  world 
markets,  and  without  a  large  country 
that  can  serve  as  a  regional  conduit 
to  world  markets,  as  Brazil  and  India 
might.  For  these  regions,  economic 
geography  poses  a  three-dimensional 
challenge.  Côte  d’Ivoire  or  Tanzania 

can  hardly  be  blamed  for  worrying 
most  about  their  own  poor,  and  not 
their  less  fortunate  neighbors  such  as 
Burkina Faso or Burundi. Indeed, see-
ing the beneﬁ ts of regional cooperation, 
they have made repeated efforts to fos-
ter integration in their neighborhoods. 
The  ECOWAS  even  includes  a  clause 
that allows workers to cross borders, a 
stage  of  integration  rivaled  only  (and 
only  recently)  by  the  EU.  It  also  has 
tried  to  share  regional  infrastructure. 
Other such regions are Central Africa, 
Central  Asia,  and  the  Paciﬁ c  Islands. 
Countries in such regions face a three-
dimensional  challenge  (see  “Geogra-
phy in Motion: Density, Distance, and 
Division  in  Sub- Saharan  Africa”).  A 
combination of efforts to improve insti-
tutional cooperation and regional infra-
structure investments is needed—but it 
is not enough. Targeted incentives also 
will be necessary, through preferential 
access  to  developed  country  markets, 
perhaps made conditional on regional 
collaboration  to  improve  institutions 
and infrastructure. 

Everyone should support the efforts of 
these  “bottom  billion”  countries  to  inte-
grate  their  economies,  within  and  across 
borders. A billion lives depend on it. 

We  are  familiar  with  the  sectoral  transformations  needed  for  economic  growth—the 
changes in work and organization as agrarian economies become industrialized and service 
oriented. This Report discusses the spatial transformations that also must happen for coun-
tries to develop. Higher densities, shorter distances, and lower divisions will remain essential 
for economic success in the foreseeable future. They should be encouraged. With them will 
come unbalanced growth. When accompanied by policies for integration calibrated to the 
economic geography of nations, these changes also will bring inclusive development—sooner, 
not much later.

Navigating This Report 

In 1971 Simon Kuznets, a Russian émigré 

who  had  built  his  career  in  the  United 
States,  was  awarded  the  Nobel  Prize  in 
Economics  “for  his  empirically  founded 
interpretation of economic growth, which 
has led to new and deepened insight into the 
economic and social structure and process 
of development.”1 In his prize lecture, Kuz-
nets summarized the structural changes that 
accompany economic growth, emphasizing 
“the shift away from agriculture to nonag-
ricultural pursuits and, recently, away from 
industry to services.”2 These are the sectoral 
changes in production needed for nations to 
prosper. Nations do not develop by merely 
doing more of the same thing. They must do 
different things, and do them better. 

Over the years, this has been conﬁ rmed 
so often that it now seems almost obvious. 
Less obvious but no less important are the 
spatial  transformations  needed  for  these 
structural  shifts.  Some  places  are  suited 
for farming, others for industry, yet others 
for services. As economies become indus-
trialized  and  more  people  are  employed 
in services, their shapes must change, too. 
These changes, involving social adjustment 
as  much  as  the  economic,  can  take  time. 
The economic world is not frictionless. The 
“what” and “how” of economic production 
cannot  be  decided  without  deciding  the 
“where.” 

For  policy  makers,  especially,  it  is 
important to understand these changes and 
to appreciate the market forces that shape 
them. This understanding can be the differ-
ence between prosperity and stagnation. It 

may even be one of the main lessons of the 
twentieth century. After Kuznets left Russia 
in 1922, Soviet planners implemented one 
approach to economic geography, and the 
United  States  implemented  another.  The 
Soviet  strategy  forced  people  to  move  to 
the north and east and to spread out eco-
nomic production. Meanwhile, Americans 
moved voluntarily toward the south and the 
west, but production became more concen-
trated. Within ﬁ ve years of Kuznets’ death 
in 1985, the Soviet Union would collapse. 
At the time, Russia’s per capita income was 
a quarter that of the United States. Spatial 
inefﬁ ciency  was  not  the  only  reason  why 
y
the Soviet Union fell. But it could not have 
helped. 

As Russia has moved from plan to mar-
ket,  spatial  efﬁ ciency  increased.  Between 
1989 and 2004, almost all new ﬁ rms chose 
locations with the best access to Moscow, 
St. Petersburg, and international markets.3
Over  the  past  three  decades,  researchers 
have  been  documenting  the  changes  in 
economic  geography  needed  to  stay  spa-
tially efﬁ cient as technology advances and 
production  structures  change.  They  have 
studied  the  effects  of  larger  populations, 
globalizing  markets,  and  international 
borders on the location of people and pro-
duction.  They  are  starting  to  assess  how 
governments can help or hurt these trans-
formations. This Report draws on this work 
and its implications for public policy. 

Government  policies  are  important. 
With development, people and production 
become more concentrated—in towns and

cities,  and  in  areas  of  countries  closer  to 
domestic and international markets. While 
economic  activity  concentrates  in  some 
parts of a nation or the globe, many people 
may be spread out over the countryside or 
in places distant from prosperity, perhaps 
opening  sizable  geographic  disparities  in 
living standards. This Report discusses why 
this  happens,  and  assesses  what  has  been 
most  effective  in  altering  the  economic 
geography  of  developing  countries.  Eco-
nomic activity will concentrate in any case. 
But managed one way, as the United States 
did, it can foster growth and integration. 
Managed another way, it can result in dis-
integration and despair, and even conﬂ ict. 
The Report covers a broad and seemingly 
disparate  set  of  phenomena  that  span  the 
spectrum  from  local  to  national  to  inter-
national scales, from human to physical to 
political geography, and from national and 
global institutions to targeted interventions. 
To  keep  the  inquiry  disciplined  requires 
emphasizing some aspects of spatial trans-
formations and leaving others out. The rest 

BOX 0.1    What this Report is not about

To keep the Report focused, several 
important aspects of the spatial 
transformations do not get the atten-
tion they would in a fuller study. The 
main aspects not considered—ex-
cept when emphasizing or qualifying 
the most important messages—are 
the social and environmental eff  ects 
of a changing economic geography. 

Agglomeration—the growth of 

cities—can have social and environ-
mental eff ects that are benefi cial and 
some that are detrimental. Cities help 
to break down societal stereotypes 
and increase cohesion. Most progres-
sive movements throughout history 
have had urban origins. But so have 
the most violent. The propensity of 
people to commit crimes is believed 
to be greater in cities. And while cit-
ies allow individualism and creativity 
and break down social barriers, they 
also break societal ties:
The cities have always been the cradles 
of liberty, just as they are today the 
centres of radicalism. Every man of the 
world knows that isolation and solitude 

are found in a much greater degree in a 
crowded city than in a country village, 
where one’s individual concerns are the 
concern of everyone.a 

Migration also can have vastly dif-

ferent eff ects across societies, both in 
the places people leave and to those 
places they go. It almost always brings 
economic rewards, but as the anti-
 immigrant sentiments in many coun-
tries show, it also means more risk. 

Specialization of production made 
possible by falling transport costs can 
come at an environmental price. Cod 
is caught off  Norway, transported by 
plane to China to be cleaned, and 
then fl own back to Norway to be sold. 
Such specialization based on natural 
endowments (fi sh in Northern Europe, 
people in China) helps both Norwe-
gian consumers and Chinese workers, 
but the cod now has a longer carbon 
trail. The environmental eff ects of 
urbanization and transport are con-
sidered in this Report, but only when 
they qualify the Report’s messages.

of  this  chapter  summarizes  the  Report’s 
scope,  clariﬁ es  its  terms,  and  outlines  its 
structure. 

Scope
Governments intervene (usually incorrectly) 
to spread the beneﬁ ts of economic growth 
more  evenly  across  space.  Even  when  the 
imperatives are political, they have economic 
consequences. And even if the objectives are 
economic, they have social and environmen-
tal  effects.  Policy  makers  thus  face  sharp 
tradeoffs  and  must  compromise.  The  eco-
nomic costs of mistakes can be large and last-
ing: recognizing the importance of economic 
geography means realizing that once produc-
ers and people make decisions on where to 
locate, they can be difﬁ cult to reverse. 

Governments can do better by promoting 
the market forces that deliver both the con-
centration of economic production and the 
convergence of living standards, and aug-
ment them with policies to ensure afford-
able basic services everywhere. They can do 
this  by  helping  people  and  entrepreneurs 
take advantage of economic opportunities, 
wherever they arise. The market forces that 
help most are agglomeration, migration, and 
specialization. Their economic beneﬁ ts are 
the subject of this Report. Their social and 
environmental implications are not consid-
ered in detail (see box 0.1). The unintended 
social and environmental effects of market 
forces are important policy matters. But they 
deserve more space than can be covered in a 
report that shows how economic geography 
is reshaped during development.

The  Report  describes  the  geographic 
transformations  needed  for  development. 
It analyzes these changes using the insights 
from economic history and recent research. 
It then revisits the policy debates on urban-
ization,  regional  development,  and  inter-
national integration. This is the 31st World 
Development Report, and the issues it covers 
have been visited by earlier Reports. But here 
the facts, analysis, and policies related to spa-
tial transformations are the major focus, and 
the Report is structured accordingly. 

Terms
To formulate simple messages that are useful 
to policy makers requires an uncomplicated

terminology. The Report uses some terms 
that may not be familiar to readers, intro-
duces others, and uses yet others as short-
hand. This section clariﬁ es the terms that 
the rest of the Report uses consistently.

Spatial scales—area, country, and region
Throughout the Report, the analysis is pro-
vided  at  three  geographic  scales—local, 
national, and international. The policy con-
cerns that correspond to these spatial scales 
are, respectively, the speed and sustainability 
of the rural-urban transformation, the ter-
ritorial disparities in production and welfare 
within  countries,  and  the  same  disparities 
across countries and world regions. The units 
that correspond to these spatial scales are area, 
country,  and  region.  These  terms  are  used 
consistently throughout the Report. An “area” 
is the same as a “territory,” the target of ter-
ritorial development policies. In Anglophone 
countries, it is the same as a “region” within a 
country, as in the debates on “regional devel-
opment.” Area is used here to avoid confusion 
with another spatial scale, the international, 
because  “region”  also  describes  a  group  of 
countries, such as South Asia, which includes 
India and its neighbors. 

To ﬁ x the terms, consider the three geo-
graphic scales of the Shanghai metropoli-
tan area, the country of China, and the East 
Asia region (see map 0.1): 
(cid:129)  Area. The local scale is the municipality 
of Shanghai—which includes the city of 
Shanghai and neighboring cities, towns, 
and  villages  in  an  area  of  about  7,000 
square  kilometers,  with  a  population 

density of about 3,000 persons per square 
kilometer. The population density in the 
city is about 13,000 persons per square 
kilometer.

(cid:129)  Country.  The  national  scale  encom-
passes  the  23  provinces,  ﬁ ve  autono-
mous  regions,  and  four  municipalities 
(Shanghai  is  one  of  them)  that  make 
up  China,  covering  about  9.6  million 
square kilometers. The distance between 
the western province of Xinjiang and the 
dynamic coastal areas in the east is more 
than 4,000 kilometers. Restrictions on 
internal  migration  can  make  the  eco-
nomic distance seem much longer.

(cid:129)  Region.  The  international  scale  con-
sists of China and its East Asian neigh-
bors including Japan, Mongolia, and the 
Republic of Korea. The region is divided 
by borders, some thick, some thin.

This  Report  uses  the  notion  of  “natu-
ral”  neighborhoods,  deﬁ ned  by  elements 
of  human,  physical,  and  political  geogra-
phy. The World Bank commonly classiﬁ es 
all low- and middle-income countries into 
six  regions,  and  groups  all  high-income 
countries together, regardless of their loca-
tion. This Report classiﬁ es the world into 
16 regions that include both developed and 
developing  countries,  using  geographic 
proximity  as  the  most  important  crite-
rion (see box 0.2). It is also more detailed. 
Sub-Saharan Africa, for example, has four 
regions—West, Central, East, and Southern. 
East Asia and the Paciﬁ c has three—North-
east, Southeast, and the Paciﬁ c Islands. The

BOX 0.2    This Report’s regions are more detailed than the World Bank’s

This Report is about geography and eco-
nomic development, focusing more on spa-
tial variability of conditions and outcomes 
than economic analysis usually does. Where 
appropriate, it uses countries or areas 
within countries as the units of analysis. But 
where the emphasis is on regional integra-
tion and interactions between neighboring 

sovereign states, the Report uses an aggre-
gation of countries that is more detailed 
than the six standard World Bank regions, 
which can hide signifi cant variation. 
Adapting the United Nations geo-

graphic regions but remaining consistent 
with World Bank regions yields the 16 
regions displayed here. Depending on 

the context, the analysis in this Report 
ignores the income of countries within 
a region—say, where regional growth 
spillovers from industrial to developing 
countries are of interest—or treats the 
Organisation of Economic Co-operation 
and Development (OECD) and other high-
income economies separately.

term “region” is used throughout the Report 
to refer to these 16 groups of countries. 

While the choice of area or region can 
be arbitrary, these spatial scales conform 
well  to  the  levels  of  policy  making.  This 
Report  aims  to  inform  policy  making  at 
these three levels—subnational, national, 
and international.

Spatial dimensions—density, distance, 
and division
To  describe  the  geographic  transforma-
tions  that  accompany  development,  the 
Report introduces the use of three spatial 
dimensions—density,  distance,  and  divi-
sion. These dimensions help the reader see 
development in real space—in three dimen-
sions, in other words. The terms are easy 
metaphors, but they also have a technical 

interpretation.  Density  generally  signiﬁ es 
the intensity of economic activity on a unit 
of land, say, a square kilometer. Data limi-
tations  can  force  compromise:  since  pro-
duction and population densities are closely 
related, and production data are less easily 
available, population density is sometimes 
used as a proxy for economic density. It can 
get a bit confusing. London is probably the 
city with the highest economic density in 
the world, but Mumbai, with 30,000 people 
per  square  kilometer,  is  the  most  densely 
populated.  Distance  signiﬁ es  the  costs  of 
getting to places with economic density. 

While density and distance relate closely 
to human and physical geography, division 
refers  more  to  sociopolitical  geography. 
Religion, ethnicity, and language are among 
the  main  attributes  that  lead  to  divisions

between places. While divisions are great-
est across nations, they can be considerable 
within countries as well. 

These  dimensions  are  measurable.  But 
unlike  height,  length,  and  breadth,  for 
example,  the  geographic  dimensions  are 
not orthogonal. Better analogs for the three 
dimensions  are  a  person’s  height,  weight, 
and age, which are related. Likewise, as dis-
tances increase, it is likely that divisions also 
get stronger. Density, distance, and division 
are  best  illustrated  by  market  access,  an 
indicator  of  economic  opportunity  for  a 
location that tells the size of the potential 
markets in its vicinity, and the ease of reach-
ing them. Market access across geographic 
scales determines where economic activity 
can thrive and thus where ﬁ rms will locate 
and populations will grow. 

Using this concept of market access, the 

three dimensions are deﬁ ned as follows:

(cid:129)  Density  indicates  the  size  of  economic 
output  or  total  purchasing  power  per 
unit of surface area—say, a square kilo-
meter. It is highest in large cities where 
economic  activity  is  concentrated  and 
much lower in rural neighborhoods.

(cid:129)  Distance measures the ease of reaching 
markets. It determines access to oppor-
tunity.  Areas  far  from  economically 
dense  centers  in  a  country  are  more 
likely to lag.

(cid:129)  Division  arises  from  barriers  to  eco-
nomic interactions created by differences 
in currencies, customs, and languages, 
which restrict market access. It is most 
relevant in an international context.

The concept of distance is also relevant 
internationally.  The  difference  between 
distance and division is that distance mod-
ulates access to economic opportunity in a 
more  continuous  way—a  distance  decay. 
Division,  by  contrast,  presents  discrete 
barriers  to  access  and  economic  integra-
tion. It can be seen as increasing economic 
distance or travel time for a unit of physical 
(or Euclidian) distance.

These  deﬁ nitions  are  not  scientiﬁ cally 
exact.  But  the  terms  are  used  consistently 
in  the  Report.  When  “density”  is  used,  it 
means  economic  density:  production  per 
area  of  land.  When  any  other  measure  of 

density—such as the population per square 
kilometer  (as  in  chapters  1  and  7)  or  the 
places where more of a nation’s poor people 
live (as in chapters 2 and 8), it is qualiﬁ ed 
accordingly. 

Distance  can  be  measured  with  some 
precision, but where infrastructure is sparse, 
straight-line distance is different from road 
or rail distance. Many other factors, such as 
the  availability  and  affordability  of  trans-
port  services,  determine  actual  accessibil-
ity.  Where  such  information  is  available, 
it is used. Chapter 1, for example, reports a 
uniform measure of urbanization based on 
places  that  both  have  minimum  levels  of 
population density and are within an hour’s 
travel  time  to  sizable  settlements.  In  com-
puting this “agglomeration index,” the qual-
ity of transport infrastructure is taken into 
account. Division is associated with interna-
tional borders, because they usually impede 
the ease of exchange or travel. But not all bor-
ders imply divisions. Those in the European 
Union (EU), for instance, have increasingly 
ceased to reﬂ ect divisions between countries. 
And not all divisions imply international bor-
ders. Where religious, ethnic, and linguistic 
differences are manifest spatially, there can 
be divisions within countries.

There is a correspondence between the 
geographic scales and dimensions. Locally, 
within an area, the most important dimen-
sion is density, because generally distances 
are short and divisions few. Nationally, the 
most  important  dimension  is  distance  to 
density;  divisions  within  countries  tend 
to be fewer, though they can be serious in 
some  countries.  Internationally,  across  a 
regional  or  global  spatial  scale,  distances 
and divisions are usually more serious.

Using these three dimensions, the Report 
summarizes the geographic transformations 
needed for development (part one). It shows 
how market forces drive these transforma-
tions (part two). And it assesses how govern-
ments can augment these forces to sustain 
growth and reduce poverty (part three).

Instruments for integration—

places  where  economic  production  is 
 concentrated  and  places  that  are  lagging. 
Some of these policy instruments are spa-
tially explicit, like a slum-upgrading pro-
gram  in  a  city,  a  Brazilian  state’s  ﬁ scal 
incentives to a U.S. automobile company, 
or the EU’s structural and cohesion funds. 
Others are intended to be universal in their 
coverage,  including  compulsory  and  free 
basic education for all children, such labor 
market regulations as minimum wage laws, 
and  the  enforcement  of  property  rights. 
Between these spatially targeted programs 
and  “spatially  blind”  policies  are  invest-
ments and regulations that connect places, 
such  as  roads,  airports,  and  communica-
tions systems. 

In  their  current  form,  the  debates  on 
how  governments  can  foster  rural-urban 
transformation, help lagging areas reduce 
poverty, and—in the poorest nations in the 
world—improve access to world markets all 
emphasize geographic targeting. The debate 
on how to promote healthy urbanization is 
polarized between an emphasis on villages, 
where a majority of the world’s poor still 
live, and a belief that the way out of poverty 
lies in cities; if urban poverty increases, the 
focus shifts from villages to slums. Moti-
vated by within-country spatial disparities 
in living standards, the debate on territorial 
development tends to be similarly ﬁ xated 
on promoting economic growth in lagging 
areas. At the international level, preferential 
market access for the least developed coun-
tries can end up dominating policy discus-
sions.  Part  three  of  the  Report  reframes 
these debates, calling for a shift from spatial 
targeting to integration.

The  policy  instruments  for  economic 
integration  can  be  classiﬁ ed  in  three  cat-
egories,  based  on  how  explicitly  place  is 
considered in their scope and design:

(cid:129)  Institutions is shorthand for all the pol-
icy instruments that are spatially blind. 
These are the amenities that governments 
should  provide  to  everyone,  regardless 
of  place.  The  word “institutions”  con-
notes universality, and includes mecha-
nisms for ﬁ nancing and delivering such 
basic amenities as the administration of 
justice, public security, the regulation of 
land, labor, and capital markets, primary 

education  and  health,  and  electricity, 
water,  and  sanitation.  Systems  for  col-
lecting taxes and ﬁ nancing the spending 
associated  with  these  services  are  also 
best designed without speciﬁ c places in 
mind. 

(cid:129)  Infrastructure is the summary term for 
all spatially connective investments and 
the associated rules and regulations. It 
includes  roads  and  railways,  airports 
and air transport systems, telecommu-
nications, and the Internet.

(cid:129)  Interventions  is  shorthand  for  all  spa-
tially  focused  incentives.  These  include 
regulations  and  investments  that  favor 
some  places,  such  as  export  processing 
zones. They also include place-based pro-
grams—such as slum-upgrading schemes 
like  Rio  de  Janeiro’s  Favela  Bairro,  or 
Superintendency for the Development of 
the Northeast (SUDENE), Brazil’s devel-
opment agency for the lagging Northeast, 
or the Everything But Arms initiative of 
the EU, which gives the least developed 
countries  preferential  trade  access  to 
European markets. 

Because  these  deﬁ nitions  do  not  con-
form strictly to common usage, additional 
clariﬁ cation is necessary:
(cid:129)  First,  spatial  blindness  does  not  mean 
spatial neutrality. A progressive tax sys-
tem, for example, may not be neutral in 
its  effects  or  outcomes.  Cities  may  end 
up contributing more in taxes than the 
countryside, and richer states may con-
tribute more than those that are poorer. 
But the guiding principle is that tax rates 
differ not by place alone, but by the attri-
butes of ﬁ rms and families that happen 
to be located there. 

(cid:129)  Second, in the common use of the term, 
infrastructure  includes  nonconnective 
investments  such  as  water  supply  and 
energy. In this Report, infrastructure is 
reserved for the spatially connective com-
ponents. Nonconnective public utilities 
are included in institutions, as for such 
basic services as sanitation. 

(cid:129)  Third, each of these categories includes 
all  three  tools  of  government  policy—
taxes, transfers and public expenditures, 
and regulations.

(cid:129)  Finally, government initiatives can include 
more than one instrument. Slum devel-
opment can include steps to make urban 
land markets work better by formalizing 
property  rights,  improving  streets,  and 
offering monetary incentives for some of 
the slum-dwellers to relocate. 

Structure
The  main  ﬁ nding  of  this  Report—at  all 
three  spatial  scales—is  that  economic 
development is not smooth, linear, or neat. 
The  processes  of  economic  growth  leave 
behind a bumpy landscape, with economic 
mass  concentrated  in  some  places.  Liv-
ing  standards  in  such  places—especially 
rising  prosperity,  good  access  to  educa-
tion and health facilities, and safe shelter, 
water,  and  sanitation,  some  of  the  most 
urgent  among  the  Millennium  Develop-
ment  Goals—improve  faster  than  where 
there  is  less  economic  activity,  widening 
the spatial disparities in welfare. But where 
there  is  sustained  economic  growth,  the 
convergence in living standards begins to 
supplant divergence. Nations become both 
spatially  efﬁ cient  and  equitable  (see  box 
0.3).  The  challenge  of  development  is  to 
institute policies that allow—even encour-
age—“unbalanced” economic growth and 
yet ensure geographically balanced devel-
opment outcomes.

The facts
Part  one  of  the  Report  presents  the  facts 
about  the  spatial  transformations—the 
changes  in  economic  density,  distance, 
and division. Chapter 1 shows that devel-
opment is accompanied by the rising den-
sity of human settlements: no country has 
reached  high  income  without  this  rise  in 
density.  Chapter  2  expands  the  scale  and 
shows that development is also accompa-
nied  by  the  greater  concentration  of  eco-
nomic activity in areas of countries closer 
to  economic  density.  Chapter  3  incorpo-
rates international divisions that slow, but 
do not prevent, the concentration of eco-
nomic activities in some countries. At the 
local, national, and international scales the 
pattern is similar: rapidly rising concentra-
tions at the early stage and then a slowing 
down.

BOX 0.3    This Report’s message is not anti-equity 

Policies for spatially balanced growth 
are often justifi ed by equity. The EU 
describes its territorial policy as gov-
erned by the principle of solidarity 
because it “aims to benefi t citizens 
and regions that are economically 
and socially deprived relative to 
EU averages.”a The policy seems to 
equate social and spatial equity—
equality across individuals, and the 
equality of living standards across 
states and countries. This Report, by 
contrast, argues in favor of the ben-
efi ts from geographic concentration 
of economic production. But it shows 
that in the earlier stages of develop-
ment, increased concentration is 
associated with spatial divergence in 
living standards such as income. So is 
this Report’s message anti-equity?
No. It is important to distinguish 
between three types of disparities: 
spatial disparities in economic pro-
duction, spatial disparities in living 
standards, and social inequality. 

Spatial disparities in economic 
activity. In both the United States 
and the EU-15 countries, gross 
domestic product (GDP) and popula-
tion have lumpy spatial distributions. 
In the United States, three states 
(California, New York, and Texas) 
generated 21 percent of national GDP 
in 2005. The same three states have 
19.8 percent of the U.S. population, 
but only 12.8 percent of the country’s 
land. Meanwhile, 10 EU subnational 
areas were responsible for 20.5 per-
cent of the EU’s GDP in 2005. These 
areas have 16.9 percent of the EU-15’s 
population, but only 8 percent of 
its land. So, in both cases, economic 
activity and population are con-
centrated. But spatial inequality of 
production and population is higher 
in the United States than in the EU. 

The Gini coeffi  cient for the spatial 
inequality of GDP is 0.53 for the 
United States and 0.41 for the EU. For 
population, the coeffi  cients are 0.54 
and 0.32, respectively. For subna-
tional areas in the EU and states in the 
United States, the numbers change, 
but the conclusion is the same.b

Spatial disparities in living stan-
dards. EU-15 countries have greater 
spatial inequality in per capita income 
and unemployment rates, two com-
mon indicators of individual living 
standards in high-income countries. 
GDP per capita, for example, exhib-
ited greater variation across EU areas 
than it did across U.S. states in 2005. 
Although production is more concen-
trated geographically in the United 
States, people are also more likely to 
live where production is, so GDP per 
capita varies less. The same is true of 
unemployment rates. In the United 
States, the state with the highest 
unemployment in 2007 (Michigan) 
had an unemployment rate of 7.2 
percent, 2.8 times the lowest unem-
ployment state (Hawaii). But in the EU 
in 2006, the ratio was 8.1. There is less 
spatial inequality in living standards 
in the United States. 

Social inequality. While spatial 

inequality in living standards is greater 
in the EU than in the United States, the 
opposite is true for social inequality 
between individuals. During the past 
few decades, the Gini coeffi  cient for 
the United States has been about 0.40, 
compared with 0.33, 0.28, and 0.23 for 
the United Kingdom, Germany, and 
Austria, respectively.c

The long experience of countries shows 
that  income  differences  between  leading 
places  and  following  places  ﬁ rst  diverge 
and  then  converge,  but  only  in  the  more 
dynamic areas, countries, and regions. At 
each  of  the  three  spatial  scales,  it  pays  to 
be in dynamic neighborhoods. Economic 
growth leads to congestion in cities—and to

the growth of towns and cities that are well 
connected to fast-growing agglomerations. 
This pattern is repeated at the national and 
international levels. Expanding economic 
activity spills over to areas and countries 
that are—in economic terms—near places 
doing well. 

The insights
The second part of the Report is the “engine 
room.” It exploits the main insights from a 
quarter century of work spanning several 
subdisciplines in economics, such as indus-
trial organization, urban economics, inter-
national  trade,  and  economic  geography. 
Distilled  to  its  essence,  the  engine  works 
through  a  three-way  interaction  between 
scale  economies,  the  mobility  of  workers 
and entrepreneurs, and the costs of trans-
porting and communicating between places 
(see ﬁ gure 0.1). 

Firms  are  generally  more  productive 
when they locate in large places and when 
they operate at a relatively large size. If it 
is relatively easy to transport produce, the 
scale can be even higher, since the poten-
tial market is bigger. Workers move to these 
places, bringing with them both a supply of 
labor and a demand for goods and services. 
As  people  become  more  mobile  and  as 
transport and communications costs fall, 
these economies of scale create a circular 
and cumulative causation, where economic 
activities become even more concentrated 
spatially.  Rising  concentration  inevitably 
leads to congestion, which slows the pro-
cess  and  eventually  reverses  it.  Declines 
in  transport  costs  ﬁ rst  make  concentra-
tion possible, and then, when they fall low 
enough, they make it unnecessary. 

Part two discusses these interactions in 
some detail, summarizing more than a cen-
tury  of  experience  and  the  novel  insights 
that  come  from  a  generation  of  research 
recognizing how factor mobility and fall-
ing transport costs feed economies of scale 
(see box 0.2). They should change what we 
can expect from the markets, and what gov-
ernments can and should do to facilitate the 
concentration of production and promote 
the convergence in living standards.

Chapter 4 provides evidence of agglom-
eration economies—increasing returns to 

scale associated with places, not plants—in 
producing goods, services, and ideas. Places 
of different sizes provide varying agglom-
eration beneﬁ ts, and congestion associated 
with spatial concentration leads to a portfo-
lio of places that facilitate economic growth, 
with different parts in the lead depending 
on the stage of development. 

Chapter  5  explains  the  interaction 
between scale economies and factor mobil-
ity, focusing on the migration of workers. 
Chapter  6  explains  the  nonlinear  rela-
tionship  between  transport  costs  and  the 
geographic  concentrations  of  production, 
focusing  on  intraindustry  trade,  which  is 
especially sensitive to transport costs. These 
chapters summarize the new insights pro-
vided by the three-way interaction between 
scale economies, factor mobility, and trans-
port  costs—and  their  implications  for 
development policy (see box 0.4).

The policy framework
Circular causation, unevenness, and spill-
overs  make  for  a  world  in  which  poli-
cies  can  promote  economic  growth  and 
improve social welfare beyond what mar-
kets yield, because well-executed policies 
can set these transformations in motion or 
speed them up. 

These  features  of  economic  develop-
ment  also  make  policy  making  a  difﬁ -
cult  enterprise.  Part  three  of  the  Report 
reframes three important policy debates, 
using a principle derived from its ﬁ rst two 
parts: for developing countries to realize 
the beneﬁ ts of both spatial concentration 
of  production  and  convergence  in  con-
sumption, development is best facilitated 
by economic integration. Using the three 
dimensions—density, distance, and divi-
sion—described in part one, and the (mal)
functioning of pivotal markets at each spa-
tial  scale—land,  labor,  and  intermediate 
inputs—analyzed in part two, the chapters 
in part three provide a simple framework 
and  illustrate  its  workings  through  real-
world  policy  experience.  At  each  of  the 
geographic scales, the response rule is the 
same—an instrument per dimension. Here 
is  a  somewhat  oversimpliﬁ ed  summary, 
using examples from only the local scale 
(chapter 7):

BOX 0.4     Fresh insights from economic geography: concentration, convergence, and integration

Over the past two decades, new analysis 
has changed the way we think about the 
location of production, trade, and develop-
ment. The analysis builds on two elements. 
First, large markets are disproportionately 
attractive for fi rms producing with scale 
economies. Firms with a larger home 
market have more sales that, with scale 
economies, imply lower unit costs and 
more profi ts, which encourage existing 
fi rms to expand and attract new fi rms. Sec-
ond, large markets are big partly because 
many fi rms and consumers locate there. 
Market access and mobility creates a circu-
lar and cumulative causation. A large mar-
ket attracts fi rms and workers—and the 
demand for intermediate inputs by fi rms 
and the demand for fi nal goods by workers 
make the market even larger, attracting 
more fi rms and workers, and so on.

This is both good and bad news for 
places with poor initial conditions. It is 
good because it means that fi rm location 
is not as constrained by nature as theories 
based on comparative advantage would 
have us believe. Places with poor endow-
ments can sustain concentration of activity. 
It is bad news because the circle of market 
access and mobility produces persistence. 
Once a place gets far ahead, it is diffi  cult for 
lagging areas to catch up. While agglom-
eration raises the cost of labor, fi rms do 
not move to low-wage areas, because this 
would mean forgoing the benefi ts of prox-
imity to suppliers and customers.

Concentration is the rule. The strength 

of the agglomeration forces created by 
market access and mobility depends on 

transport costs, but the relationship is not 
linear. When these costs are high, fi rms 
avoid shipping their output long distances 
by spreading out their production. Firm 
location is then mostly determined by 
local access to immobile demand, such as 
from farmers and miners. For intermediate 
values of trade costs, it becomes feasible 
to supply markets from a distance, and 
places that get an advantage in market size 
build on it and take off  relative to other 
places. When trade costs fall to low levels, 
it matters little whether one sells and buys 
locally. Firm location is then determined 
mostly by the local cost of immobile fea-
tures, including the cost of land and hous-
ing, but also by the ability to have face-to-
face interactions or to fi nd a good match in 
a specialized labor market. So once trade 
costs decline suffi  ciently, some activities 
will spread out in response to cost diff er-
ences, and others will remain concentrated.

Convergence is the objective. The 
forces of market access and mobility 
have implications for the way we think 
about convergence. The view of develop-
ment as smooth and linear gives way to a 
lumpier nonlinear process. As a country 
grows, new producers locate close to 
existing production, widening the pro-
duction diff erences between lagging and 
leading places. When wage gaps become 
wide, industry starts to spread to places 
that have low wages. But this does not 
lead to steady development of all places. 
Instead, development takes place in 
waves, where some areas or countries are 
drawn in sequence out of poverty and are 

pulled rapidly through the development 
process. In the neoclassical world, being 
behind can be an advantage—places lag-
ging farther can catch up faster. But with 
agglomeration economies, the farther 
behind an area, country, or region, the 
tougher it is to catch up. What should lag-
ging places do?

Integration is the answer. Because 

both high and low trade costs can 
encourage production to spread out, 
lagging areas, countries, or regions could 
in principle turn to either import substi-
tution or export-oriented industrializa-
tion. But import substitution becomes 
less feasible as a development strategy 
over time. Why? Because it limits for-
eign access to local immobile demand, 
whereas export-oriented industrialization 
reduces the cost of purchasing foreign 
intermediates for processing and export. 
The falling share of agriculture and the 
tendency of manufacturing and services 
to agglomerate have reduced the share of 
demand in lagging places. And the frag-
mentation of production has made access 
to intermediate inputs more important. 
Both make development strategies based 
on fencing off  local immobile demand 
hopeless. The observation that some 
developed countries or provinces indus-
trialized while being closed to trade is of 
little help to lagging areas, countries, or 
regions today. The ones left behind are so 
small relative to the world economy that 
isolation is no longer a feasible option.

(cid:129)  For  one-dimensional  problems,  a  cali-
brated  response  would  be  spatially 
blind  policies.  In  areas  experiencing 
incipient urbanization, for example, the 
policy  objective  should  be  to  facilitate 
rising density, and policy makers should 
pay  special  attention  to  institutions  to 
improve  the  functioning  of  (rural  and 
urban) land markets. 

(cid:129)  For  two-dimensional  problems,  the 
response  should  include  both  spatially 
blind and connective policies. For exam-
ple,  in  areas  of  a  country  undergoing 
rapid urbanization, the policy problems 

are not only to facilitate the increase in 
density, but also to alleviate the problem 
of  distance  caused  by  growing  conges-
tion.  The  response  includes  improve-
ments in institutions to facilitate rising 
density  as  just  outlined—and  invest-
ments  in  infrastructure  to  address  the 
growing problem of economic distance. 
(cid:129)  For  three-dimensional  problems,  the 
response should include spatially blind, 
connective,  and  targeted  policies.  In 
highly  urbanized  areas  of  a  country, 
for  example,  the  problems  of  density 
and  distance  are  compounded  by divi-

sions within urban areas, most notice-
ably between formally settled parts of a 
metropolis and slums, where land mar-
kets use informal conventions. An effec-
tive policy response includes institutions, 
infrastructure, and interventions. 

At the national level, a similarly gradu-
ated policy response can help to integrate 
lagging and leading areas (chapter 8), and 
at the international level, it can help to inte-
grate  poor  countries  with  world  markets 
(chapter 9). 

At  all  three  geographic  scales,  policy 
debates  have  one  thing  in  common:  cur-
rently,  they  begin  and  end  with  discus-
sions  of  spatially  targeted  interventions. 
This Report calls for a rebalancing of these 
debates to include all the elements of a suc-
cessful approach to spatial integration—in-
stitutions, infrastructure, and incentives. 

This  Report  takes  a  long-term  per-
spective, chronicling spatial disparities in 
today’s  developed  economies  when  they 
were  at  incomes  comparable  to  those  of 
today’s low- and middle-income countries. 
It also systematically documents the rela-
tionship  between  spatial  disparities  and 
development for a large set of countries. In 
its conclusions, it makes a sharper distinc-
tion between spatial disparities in economic 
production  and  those  in  welfare.  And  it 
recommends using agglomeration rents in 
leading areas to push up social welfare in 
lagging  areas—and  not,  except  in  special 
circumstances, to push economic produc-
tion out to those places.
(cid:129)  At the local spatial scale, the policy objec-
tive should be to improve the quality of 
urbanization  to  maximize  its  growth 
effects. Chapter 7 discusses how the pri-
orities  of  policy  makers  should  change 
as urbanization advances. It pays special 
attention to land use, where the potential 
for market malfunctioning is greatest.

(cid:129)  At the national spatial scale, the policy 
objective should be to improve the mar-
ket access of workers and entrepreneurs, 
especially  in  a  world  in  which  dimin-
ished  distance  has  changed  the  notion 
of markets from local to global. Discuss-
ing how policy makers can reconcile the 
political objective of national unity with 

economic concentration, chapter 8 pays 
special  attention  to  labor  mobility,  for 
which the potential for market malfunc-
tioning is greatest.

(cid:129)  At  the  international  spatial  scale,  the 
policy  objective  should  be  to  promote 
convergence  in  living  standards  in  a 
world  in  which  divisions  hamper  the 
movements  of  labor  and  capital.  Dis-
cussing  how  developing  countries  can 
gain  access  to  world  markets,  chapter 
9  emphasizes  specialization  and  intra-
industry trade, in addition to exploiting 
comparative advantage based on natural 
endowments. It pays attention to trade 
in intermediate goods, which is especially 
sensitive to transport costs. 

The  Report  draws  on  both  experience 
and analysis to discipline the inquiry in a 
policy area as broad and difﬁ cult as devel-
opment itself, and it should be useful for a 
wide  readership.  But  the  Report  is  struc-
tured  to  be  friendly  to  readers  interested 
only in speciﬁ c aspects of this inquiry:
(cid:129)  The  Report  has  descriptive,  analytical, 
and  prescriptive  parts  and  progresses 
gradually from the positive to normative. 
Each  part  is  a  section  of  an  integrated 
inquiry, but each can be read separately. 
Policy makers pressed for time can read 
just  the  overview  and  the  three  policy 
chapters in part three. Students interested 
in the world’s spatial transformation can 
read just the three chapters of part one, 
which provides a three-dimensional tour 
of economic development.

(cid:129)  The Report progressively widens the spa-
tial scale for addressing the policy ques-
tions posed by economic geography, from 
local  to  national  to  international,  with 
the specialized reader in mind. Readers 
interested  in  just  the  policy  debate  on 
urbanization in developing countries can 
read just the three density cluster chap-
ters—1, 4, and 7. Those who are mostly 
interested  in  the  policy  discussion  on 
territorial development and geographic 
disparities  within  countries  can  read 
chapters 2, 5, and 8—the distance clus-
ter. Readers interested in regional inte-
gration can read just chapters 3, 6, and 9 
in the division cluster.

Overcoming Distance in North America
Overcoming Division in Western Europe

When Europeans began to colonize beyond their shores, the prospects for economic growth in North America seemed remote. Dur-
ing the Seven Years’ War (1756–63), as the French and British battled over Canada, Voltaire wondered why they should ﬁ ght over 
“a few acres of snow.” They should have been more interested in the economic potential of the Caribbean, where climate and soil 
were good for growing sugarcane, and they were. Manhattan was famously traded away by the Dutch in exchange for land around 
Suriname. But over time, it has been the few acres of snow and the rocky landscape of Plymouth (Massachusetts) that gave birth to 
the “reversal of fortune” between frigid northeastern America and the warmer south.1 

To  understand  how  this  reversal 

happened, one has to understand 
how North Americans managed 
the growing density, the vast distances 
in  the  continent,  and  the  sharp  divi-
sions  between  slaves  and  their  own-
ers,  between  natives  and  colonialists, 
between French and English—in short, 
how  North  America’s  economic  geog-
raphy has been reshaped. 

Size and American economic 
ascendancy
Size is the most obvious feature of the 
United  States’  economic  geography.2
In  1800  5.3  million  individuals  lived 
on the 865,000 squares miles of land 
given to the ﬂ edgling nation under the 
Treaty of Versailles (1783). By 1900 a 
little more than 2 million square miles 
had been added through outright pur-
chase,  spoils  of  war,  or  treaty.  Today 
the  United  States  has  more  than  300 
million  people  and  a  territory  of  3.5 
million  square  miles.  Since  1790  the 
population density of the country has 
multiplied nearly 18 times.

The challenges of distributing pop-
ulation  and  production  over  such  a 
vast space are enormous. Both people 
and productive land have moved west 
and south. In 1800 the population was 
centered  in  Maryland,  on  the  eastern 
seaboard (see map G1.1). By 1900 the 
center had moved to Indiana. Over the 
twentieth  century,  the  center  veered 

southwest,  ending  up  in  Missouri  in 
2000.  By  this  time, America’s  popula-
tion had settled mostly on its two coasts. 
Americans are as physically distant as 
they have ever been. 

How  did America  overcome  these 
vast  physical  distances?  Initially, 
institutional  mechanisms  to  allo-
cate  land  and  secure  property  rights 

were  paramount.  The  Constitution 
and the Northwest Ordinance (1787) 
provided the procedural mechanisms 
for transforming unsettled areas into 
states.  Public  land  was  disposed  of 
through  sales  to  private  individuals 
and outright grants. Eminent domain 
was  used  to  put  land  to  its  best  use, 
especially when required for railroads.

The ﬁ rst transcontinental railroad was 
completed in 1864. Indigenous popu-
lations  were  removed  forcibly,  where 
necessary, by the U.S. Army. States and 
local governments encouraged Ameri-
cans to move by offering land, build-
ing  canals,  and  supplying  schools, 
roads, and other public goods. These 
local governments competed with each 
other to attract people and ﬁ rms, offer-
ing tax and other incentives. 

People and ﬁ rms were also encour-
aged to move by the commerce clause 
of the U.S. Constitution, which explic-
itly  prohibits  state  governments  from 
engaging  in  restraint  of  trade  across 
state  boundaries.  The  institutional 
structure thus permitted the free move-
ment of people (except slaves), capital, 
and  goods,  with  attendant  property 
rights  so  that  movement  could  occur 
without economic loss.

In  this  policy  environment,  the 
“transport revolution” of the nineteenth 
century  and  growing  density  permit-
ted a fundamental change in American 
economic structures. The combination 
of  rail,  canals,  and  steamboats  vastly 
reduced the costs of medium- and long-
haul  transport  compared  with  wagon 
transport  alone.3  The  country  became 
more  urban  and  dense,  while  regional 
economic  structures  diverged.  New 
England,  which  had  been  80  percent 
agricultural in 1800 despite its poor soils 
and climate, started to develop manufac-
tures, while the Midwest specialized in 
food. By the beginning of the twentieth 
century, the United States had become 
the largest manufacturer in the world.

The growing density and the migra-
tion  of  people  and  ﬁ rms  were  driven 
largely  by  market  forces.  Most  settle-
ment was cautious. Railroads were built 
when  (and  where)  investors  thought 
they  could  make  a  proﬁ t  and  moved 
incrementally  across  the  country. 
Occasionally settlement did “leapfrog,” 
jumping over large expanses of land to 
get someplace else, as in California after 
the discovery of gold in 1849. But that 
simply accelerated the pace of realloca-
tion of labor in America.

Convergence in living standards
The  American  Civil  War  had  long-
 lasting economic effects that divided the 
country. Per capita incomes fell sharply 
in the South after the Civil War, both 
absolutely and relative to the rest of the 
country. In 1900 per capita income in 
Alabama was still half of the national 
average.  In  1938  Franklin  Roosevelt 
famously remarked that the South was 
the  nation’s  “number  one  economic 
problem.” America had its lagging areas. 
But  the  twentieth  century  experience 
was one of steady convergence of living 
standards. 

In the United States, a clear negative 
relationship exists between the level of 
per capita income in a state in 1900 and 
the  income  growth  in  that  state  over 
the next century. That is, poorer states 
grew faster than richer states between 
1900 and 2000, a phenomenon known 
as “beta- convergence.” The main expla-
nation for this phenomenon is migra-
tion of people. In the twentieth century, 

the  dominant  pattern  of  movement 
was from poorer to richer states. Prob-
ably the most important example is the 
migration of African Americans from 
the  rural  South  to  the  urban  North 
(and West), beginning in earnest dur-
ing World War I and becoming a tidal 
wave during and just after World War 
II. States such as Mississippi and Loui-
siana  now  rank  lowest  in  disposable 
income, but it is easy to imagine that 
they would have been much worse off 
without this migration. 

Convergence  has  been  aided  by 
reductions in transport costs. Many of 
the most important inventions in trans-
port and communications happened in 
the United States. In the twentieth cen-
tury,  the  network  expanded  with  the 
diffusion of the airplane, the automo-
bile,  and  electronic  communications. 
Today, 16 of the 30 busiest airports in 
the world are in the United States, and 
there are more than 75 automobiles for 
every 100 Americans.

The invention and diffusion of the 
automobile  led  to  the  enlargement  of 
cities  through  a  pronounced “ﬂ atten-
ing”  of  urban  density  as  one  moves 
from the center city to the suburbs. This 
helped magnify agglomeration econo-
mies, but it also produced social divi-
sions.  The  U.S.  system  of  local  public 
ﬁ nance, relying on local property taxes 
to fund services, is poorly designed to 
effect income redistribution. Rich and 
middle-class households can avoid sub-
sidizing others by moving to new sub-
urbs. Race also plays a role—the central 
city is predominantly “black” whereas 
the suburbs are “white.”

For  better  or  for  worse,  growth  in 
automobiles beneﬁ ted from the Federal 
Highway Act of 1956, which authorized 
building  of  the  Eisenhower  Interstate 
System of highways. In a famous speech, 
President  Eisenhower  recounted  how 
as  a  young  ofﬁ cer  he  participated  in 
the ﬁ rst transcontinental motor convoy 
from  Washington,  D.C.,  to  San  Fran-
cisco  in  1919.  The  trip  took  62  days, 
encountering every type of delay imag-
inable  along  the  way.  Today,  courtesy 
of  the  system,  a  driver  can  cover  the 
2,819-mile journey in two days. Recent 
research  shows  that  the  47,000-mile 
network  of  highways  has  integrated 
formerly  isolated  rural  areas  into  the 
national economy and fostered metro-
politan growth.

What have these connections done to 
the distribution of population and eco-
nomic activity? Paradoxically, as the cen-
ter of gravity moved toward the interior 
of North America, the interior—except 
for its metropolises—has hollowed out. 
Missouri  has  just  5.5  million  people, 
more than half of them in the greater St. 
Louis area. Spreading out the transport 
infrastructure has not spread people out, 
but it has allowed growth from agglom-
eration economies to occur in more cit-
ies across the country. The distribution 
of population in 2000 is clustered in cit-

ies, in the Northeast and on the coasts, 
producing  what  is  known  as  “sigma-
convergence,” a reduction in the income 
inequality across states (see map G1.2). 
By  one  measure,  the  dispersion  across 
Density, Distance and Division
D
states in per capita income had fallen to 
one-third its 1880 level by 2000. 

across states; over a decade, more than 
a  quarter  of  the  population  changes 
its  state  of  residence.  By  overcoming 
distance and division, and by permit-
ting  population  and  production  to 
be  uneven  across  space  through  free 
mobility,  per  capita  incomes  in  the 
United States today are both high and 
remarkably similar across the different 
states.

Rising density, falling 
disparities, persisting divisions
The  long-run  economic  performance 
of the United States is exemplary. Per 
capita  income  growth  has  averaged 
1.8  percent  per  year  for  the  last  180 
years, leading to a cumulative 26-fold 
improvement  in  living  standards. 
Alongside this growth, income inequal-
ity across states has fallen. America has 
realized  economies  of  scale—ﬁ rst  at 
the  plant  level,  then  at  the  local  level 
as towns specialized in manufacturing, 
and later at the metropolis level in the 
major urban agglomerations in places 
like Los Angeles and New York. 

The United States today is composed 
of a highly effective set of national mar-
kets  in  goods  and  factors  of  produc-
tion. Place still matters in determining 
income,  but  it  matters  in  the  short 
run,  not  the  long,  and  the  short  run 
is much shorter than it was a century 
ago. Major local shocks like Hurricane 
Katrina  have  far  less  impact  on  local 
growth prospects than before. After the 
Mariel boatlift brought 125,000 Cuban 
refugees  to  Miami  in  the  early  1980s, 
regional  wages  did  not  experience  a 
perceptible impact.

The  result  is  a  seeming  paradox: 
wages in America (corrected for human 
capital)  are  similar  in  different  loca-
tions, while economic activity is highly 
unequal across space. Europe is lauded 
for having lower social inequality, but 
North America is more spatially equal. 
And  it  has  a  more  spatially  efﬁ cient 
distribution of economic production. 
The reason: a mobile labor force. Every 
year about 8 million Americans move 

A remaining challenge for the United 
States is the removal of divisions. The 
North  American  Free  Trade  Agree-
ment (NAFTA) is a step in this direc-
tion. But it is a modest step. Consider 
Canadian-U.S. market integration. One 
study  found  that  trade  among  Cana-
dian  provinces  was  much  larger  than 
between Canada and the United States, 
controlling  for  distance  and  the  eco-
nomic  size  (gross  domestic  products) 
of  the  trading  partners,  in  this  case, 
states and provinces.4 Given California’s 
size, for example, its trade with Ontario 
should  have  been  10  times  Ontario’s 
trade  with  British  Columbia,  Califor-
nia’s closest Canadian neighbor. In fact, 
Ontario’s trade with British Columbia 
was three times its trade with Califor-
nia. Even one of the thinnest borders in 
the world has a large negative inﬂ uence 
on trade. 

Along  its  northern  boundary,  the 
United States and Canada share 3,987 
miles, the longest unguarded interna-
tional border in the world. The situation 
is markedly different along the south-
ern border with Mexico. The border is 
guarded—not closely enough for many 
U.S. citizens—to keep potential illegal 
immigrants  from  entering.  There  are 
even proposals to build a fence stretch-
ing across the 1,933 mile border. Such 
barriers are an obstacle to convergence 
between countries in the North Ameri-
can continent.

Part One
Seeing Development in 3-D 

As the world’s economy grows, people and production are concentrating, pulled as if by 
gravity to prosperous places—growing cities, leading areas, and connected countries. As it 
did decades ago in today’s high-income countries, the drive to density in low- and middle-
income countries can increase the sense of deprivation as the economic distance between 
prosperous areas and those left behind widens. And although rapid advances in transport 
and communication increasingly bind together geographically distant communities around 
the world and open new opportunities for exchange, political divisions that obstruct 
the fl ow of people, capital, and goods remain. Part one of this Report defi nes the spatial 
dimensions—density, distance, and division—and describes their evolution with economic 
development. Chapters 1, 2, and 3 show how the economic geography at the local, national, 
and international scales is changing, and how the scope and pace of these changes 
compare with transformations in the economic geography of North America, Europe, and 
Japan when they were at similar stages of development. This broad sweep of stylized facts 
informs the analysis in part two and the policy discussions in part three of the Report.

CHAPTER 1

Density

Mostly  off  the  world’s  radar,  on 

a  dusty  plain  in  West  Africa, 
is a city of 1.6 million people. 
Bisected by the River Niger, its two halves—
with about 800,000 people each—are linked 
by only two bridges. The pressure of move-
ment is so strong that every morning one of 
these bridges is dedicated to incoming traf-
ﬁ c: minibuses, bicycles, motorbikes, pedes-
trians, and occasionally private cars. In the 
evenings, to leave the center means joining 
an  exodus  of  people  toward  the  minibus 
depots. Green vans loaded with passengers 
ﬁ le out to residential neighborhoods as far 
as 20 kilometers away. This is Bamako, Mali. 
It  contracts  into  its  center  every  morning 
and breathes out again in the evening.

With each breath Bamako grows bigger. 
It happens to be one of the fastest-growing 
cities  in  the  world.  Natural  demographic 
growth is supplemented by migration from 
the countryside and other Malian cities. Its 
population in 2008 is 50 percent larger than 
10  years  ago,  making  it  the  same  size  as 
Budapest, Dubai, or Warsaw. It has 10 times 
more  inhabitants  than  the  next  biggest 
Malian city and accommodates 70 percent 
of the country’s industrial establishments.1
New neighborhoods—quartiers—formerly 
villages, become consolidated with the rest 
of the city, toward the south, east, and west. 
Some of Bamako’s people are now moving 
out  into  surrounding  neighborhoods  in 
search of cheaper land and some tranquil-
ity, but they remain within reach of the city 
because it provides their livelihoods.

Despite its industriousness, Bamako is 
one  of  the  sleepier  cities  in  West  Africa. 
Many  of  the  manufactured  staples  come 
1,184  kilometers  by  road  from  one  of  the 
region’s metropolises, Abidjan, which has 
more  than  twice  Bamako’s  population. 
Abidjan  seems  small  beside  Lagos,  where 
activity is so concentrated that its residents 
speak of living in a pressure-cooker. Some 
families rent rooms to sleep for six hours 
and then turn them over to another fam-
ily  that  takes  their  place.  Shopping  does 
not  necessarily  require  travel:  goods  are 
brought on foot and cart to drivers stuck in 
Lagos’s interminable trafﬁ c jams. To some, 
like the authors of Lagos’s 1980 master plan 
written when the city had just 2.5 million 
residents, the continuing growth of the city 
is “undisciplined.”2 What can possibly be so 
attractive about living in Lagos that, despite 
its  congestion  and  crime,  it  continues  to 
draw migrants?

The  short  answer:  economic  density. 
Lagos is not the most economically dense 
city in the world, nor even the most densely 
populated.  Those  distinctions  belong  to 
Central  London  and  Mumbai,  respec-
tively.  Even  so,  Nigeria’s  economic  future 
and  Lagos’s  growth  are  as  inextricably 
tied as Britain’s economy is with London’s 
growth.  No  country  has  developed  with-
out  the  growth  of  its  cities.  As  countries 
become richer, economic activity becomes 
more  densely  packed  into  towns,  cities, 
and  metropolises.  This  geographic  trans-
formation of economies seems so natural

that—at an impersonal aggregate level—it 
is  taken  for  granted.  But  moving  to  eco-
nomic density is a pathway out of poverty 
both  for  those  who  travel  on  it  and,  ulti-
mately, for those left behind. Jane Jacobs, 
the noted urbanist, did not have Bamako 
and Lagos in mind when she wrote, “A met-
ropolitan economy, if it’s working well, is 
constantly transforming many poor people 
into   middle-class  people,  many  illiterates 
into skilled people, many greenhorns into 
competent  citizens.  Cities  don’t  lure  the 
middle  class.  They  create  it.”3  She  might 
as well have written: as Lagos and Bamako 
grow, they will ﬁ ll in West Africa’s missing 
middle. 

This chapter introduces density, the ﬁ rst 
of the geographic dimensions of develop-
ment, deﬁ ned as the economic mass or out-
put generated on a unit of land. Surveying 
the evolution of density with development, 
the  chapter  presents  stylized  facts  about 
how density in a country rises with urban-
ization,  rapidly  at  ﬁ rst,  and  then  more 
slowly.  These  changes  are  associated  ini-
tially with a divergence of living standards 
between places with economic density and 
those  without,  later  with  a  convergence. 
Living standards thus eventually converge 
between areas of different density, such as 
urban and rural. Even within cities, densely 
populated slums amid formal settlements, 
the differences slowly disappear with devel-
opment. But this convergence does not hap-
pen by itself. It requires the institutions to 
manage land markets, investments in infra-
structure,  and  well-timed  and  executed 
interventions. 

The main ﬁ ndings:

(cid:129)  The  concentration  of  economic  activ-
ity rises with development. The world’s 
densest areas or settlements are in devel-
oped countries. But the path to these lev-
els, “urbanization” in this Report, is not 
linear. The share of a country’s popula-
tion settled in towns and cities rises rap-
idly  during  its  transformation  from  an 
agrarian to an industrial economy, which 
generally coincides with its development 
from low to middle income. The pace of 
urbanization  slows  after  that,  but  eco-

nomic  density  continues  to  increase  in 
a  postindustrial  economy  because  ser-
vices are even more densely packed than 
industry. 

(cid:129)  Rural-urban and within-urban dispar-
ities  in  welfare  narrow  with  develop-
ment. In the early stages of development, 
geographic  disparities  in  welfare  are 
large.  With  development,  these  gaps 
may increase initially. Rural-urban gaps 
in income, poverty, and living standards 
begin  to  converge  as  economies  grow, 
faster for access to social services, and 
faster in areas of more vibrant growth. 
Within-city  gaps  in  welfare  and  hous-
ing—most  obvious  in  informal  settle-
ments  or  slums—persist  for  much 
longer, and narrow only at later stages of 
development. 

(cid:129)  Neither  the  pace  of  urbanization  nor 
its  association  with  economic  growth 
is  unprecedented.  Today’s  developing 
countries are sailing in waters charted by 
developed nations, which experienced a 
similar  rush  to  towns  and  cities.  The 
speed is similar, and the routes are the 
same. What is different today is the size 
of the ship: the absolute numbers of peo-
ple being added every year to the urban 
populations of today’s developing coun-
tries are much larger than for even the 
most recent industrializers such as the 
Republic of Korea and Taiwan, China. 
Later chapters of this report investigate 
the policy implications of these similari-
ties and differences. 

Defining density
Density refers to the economic mass per unit 
of land area, or the geographic compactness 
of economic activity. It is shorthand for the 
level  of  output  produced—and  thus  the 
income generated—per unit of land area. It 
can, for example, be measured as the value 
added  or  gross  domestic  product  (GDP) 
generated  per  square  kilometer  of  land. 
Given  that  high  density  requires  the  geo-
graphic concentration of labor and capital, 
it is highly correlated with both employment 
and population density. Density is the deﬁ n-
ing characteristic of urban settlements.

The economic world is not ﬂ at
The  geographic  distribution  of  economic 
activity,  at  any  resolution,  is  uneven.  No 
matter the geographic scale examined, be 
it the country or a subnational area such as 
a province or district, there is a hierarchy 
of density. At the top is the primary city, 
and at the bottom are agricultural lands or 
rural areas. Between them is a continuum 
of settlements of varying density. 

The geographic unevenness of economic 
mass,  or  bumpiness,  tends  to  increase 
with  a  country’s  land  area.  But  even  the 
economic geography of small countries is 
bumpy.  The  Belgian  city  of  Brussels  has 
a  land  area  of  161  square  kilometers,  of 
which 159 square kilometers are used for 
nonagricultural  purposes.  On  this  small 
area, a GDP of €55 billion is generated by 
about 350,000 workers—that is, the aver-
age square kilometer of land has more than 
2,000 workers annually producing almost 
€350 million of services and goods. Brus-
sels not only has high densities of GDP and 
employment; it also has the highest popu-
lation  density  of  any  European  (EU27) 
area  classiﬁ ed  as  NUTS1  (Nomenclature 
of Territorial Units for Statistics)—more 
than  6,000  people  per  square  kilometer, 
18 times the average for Belgium.4 For the 
sake of comparison, the population den-
sity of London and Madrid is about 5,000 
people per square kilometer. 

This  density  contrasts  markedly  with 
the  agricultural  areas  of  Belgium.  In  the 
Flemish  Flanders  (Vlaams  Gewest)  area, 
6,323 square kilometers of land are used for 
agriculture. Its area is almost 40 times that 
of Brussels, but its employment is just 13 
percent of Brussels and its GDP a mere 4.5 
percent, translating into employment and 
GDP  densities  of  only  seven  workers  and 
€330,000 per square kilometer. The ratio of 
output density between Brussels and Flan-
ders is 1,000 to 1. In between metropolitan 
Brussels and rural Flanders is a range of set-
tlements, each with a different density (see 
map  1.1).  The  cities  of  Antwerp,  Brugge, 
Gent, and Leuven have an average output 
of €22 million and employment density of 
342 workers per square kilometer.5

In  both  developed  and  developing 
countries, then, the economic landscape is 
bumpy. But the topography does not corre-
spond to a simple urban-rural dichotomy. 
A continuum of density gives rise to a port-
folio  of  places.  At  the  head  is  a  country’s 
leading, primary, or largest city. Below the 
primary city is a spectrum of settlements—
secondary  cities,  small  urban  centers, 
towns, and villages (see ﬁ gure 1.1). In some 
countries, such as France and Mexico, the 
size difference between the top two cities is 
phenomenal. With a population of 10 mil-
lion, Paris dwarfs second-ranked Marseille 
with just 1.5 million. And with a population

An evolving portfolio of places
Although  the  growth  of  cities  appears 
chaotic,  the  underlying  patterns  have  a 
remarkable order (see ﬁ gure 1.2). A coun-
try’s  urban  hierarchy  is  characterized  by 
two robust regularities:
(cid:129)  The “rank-size rule”—the rank of a city in 
the hierarchy and its population are lin-
early related. 

(cid:129)  Gibrat’s law—a city’s rate of population 
growth  tends  to  be  independent  of  its 
size.

According to a special case of the rank-
size rule, known as Zipf’s law, the popula-
tion of any city is equal to the population of 
the largest city, divided by the rank of the 
city in question within the country’s urban 
hierarchy  (see  box  1.1).8  As  early  as  1682, 
Alexandre Le Maître observed a systematic 
pattern in the size of cities in France.9 For 
all classes of country, the relative size dis-
tribution  has  remained  stable  over  time, 
even  as  incomes  and  populations  grew 
(see  ﬁ gure  1.2).  Concerns  about  “urban

primacy” notwithstanding, the “portfolio of 
places” is an enduring feature of economic 
development. 

Settlements of different sizes complement 
one  another.  Metropolises,  secondary  cit-
ies, market towns, and villages are all linked 
through their complementary functions (see 
box 1.2). The primary city is often but not 
always the national administrative center and 
the seat of political power: Cambodia’s Phnom 
Penh, Cameroon’s Yaounde, and Colombia’s 
Bogotá. A country’s leading city also tends to 
be its most diversiﬁ ed, both in the provision of 
goods and services and in cultural and other 
amenities. For the cultural amenities, think of 
Broadway in New York City, the Opera House 
in Sydney, and the Louvre in Paris. But think 
also of Trinidad and Tobago’s Port of Spain, 
famous for the annual carnival that attracts 
large numbers of visitors.

Just as a primary city forms the core of 
a  country’s  metropolitan  area  with  other 
adjacent cities, other large urban centers or

BOX 1.1     Two laws and a rule: the empirical regularities of a country’s city-size distribution

The rank-size rule, discovered in 1913, can 
be expressed as the rank r associated with 
a city of size S is proportional to S to some 
negative power. The special case in which 
the estimated power equals –1 is known as 
Zipf’s law, named after a linguist, George 
Zipf. Evidence on the pervasiveness of the 
rank-size rule comes not only from large 
cities belonging to countries of diff erent 
income classes, but also from the experi-
ence of individual countries. The remark-
able westward and southward expansion 
of the U.S. urban hierarchy notwithstand-
ing, the rule provides a good description 
of the size distribution of U.S. cities for 
every decade between 1790 and 1950.a 
Indeed, even today, the rank-size rule con-
tinues to describe well the size distribution 
of U.S. cities (see fi gure below). This is so 
despite evidence that the shape of the rule 
has changed over time, becoming slightly 
fl atter so that the overall distribution of 

U.S. city sizes is more even—and that the 
rule fails to hold at the extremes of the U.S. 
city-size distribution, a common fi nding 
for many countries.b Moreover, the rank-
size rule also holds for countries as diverse 
as Kazakhstan and Morocco, providing 
further evidence of its universality (see the 
fi gure below). 

Whether the rank-size rule is really a 

rule with underlying theoretical structure 
is still under debate. It can be shown to 
follow from Gibrat’s law, which implies 
that cities grow in parallel.c This is consis-
tent with the absence of any systematic 
growth diff erences between cities. But 
this does not imply that policy is inca-
pable of infl uencing a city’s size and 
economic performance. Cities can and 
do move up and down their national 
urban hierarchies as a result of good 
and bad policy choices. And even transi-
tory departures from a parallel growth 

path can have important long-term 
repercussions for the welfare of a city’s 
inhabitants. On whether the power in the 
rank-size rule equals –1, so that Zipf’s law 
holds, many researchers seem to agree 
that, in general, it does not.

The robust message from the rank-size 
rule is that, for a given country or area, a 
wide range of city sizes coexists. Even the 
most developed countries have a portfolio 
of settlements of diff erent sizes, ranging 
from the small to the large, as opposed to 
a single megacity or a collection of cities, 
all of similar size. Agglomeration is a bal-
ancing act between centripetal and cen-
trifugal forces. The balancing point diff ers 
depending on the sector, the economic 
activities, and the type of industries.

secondary cities act as regional foci for both 
the economy and society. For example, they 
are the local centers for the ﬁ nancial sector, 
which serve the areas around them. Düs-
seldorf,  Hamburg,  Hanover,  and  Munich 
are all home to regional stock exchanges, as 
well as local concentrations of venture capi-
tal ﬁ rms.10 Dallas and Atlanta emerged as 
regional centers of commerce and ﬁ nance 
in  the  lower  South  of  the  United  States, 
and both host regional ofﬁ ces of the Fed-
eral  Reserve  Bank.11  Large  urban  centers 
and secondary cities also act as local politi-
cal  centers,  and  provide  advanced  public 
health,  education,  and  cultural  facilities. 
Hyderabad,  the  state  capital  of  Andhra 
Pradesh, with numerous universities, lead-
ing institutes for technical education, and 

private medical colleges, is a seat of learning 
in southern India.

These large regional cities are connected 
to smaller cities or major towns. The Ruhr 
area of Germany, the Randstadt area of the 
Netherlands, and the Padang-Medan hub in 
Indonesia’s Sumatra represent alliances of cit-
ies. Smaller cities within these areas consti-
tute more specialized urban centers, typically 
focusing on manufacturing and the produc-
tion  of  traditional  and  standardized  items. 
Symbiosis is the ruling order: just as the larger 
cities help to serve the smaller cities, so the 
reverse is true. For instance, the larger cities 
depend on the smaller ones for the daily pro-
vision of workers through commuting.12

Just as there are mutually beneﬁ cial links 
between larger and smaller cities, the same is

BOX 1.2    The Republic of Korea’s portfolio of places

Illustrating a well-developed portfolio 
of places are seven settlements in the 
Republic of Korea’s urban hierarchy: 
Seoul, Pusan, Daegu, Ansan, Gumi, Jeon-
geup, and Sunchang. 

Seoul is at the pinnacle of the hierarchy. 
Located 50 kilometers from the Republic 
of Korea’s border with the Democratic 
Republic of Korea in the Han River basin, 
it is the country’s capital and home to 
a quarter of its population (that is, 9.76 
million people). It serves as the nation’s 
political center and cultural heart. Also 
typical is its specialization in business 
services, fi nance, insurance, real estate, 
and wholesaling and retailing. Overall, 
services account for 60 percent of the local 
economy. Seoul is also highly specialized 
in publishing and printing and in fashion 
design and high-end apparel, with the two 
industries employing more than half the 
city’s 465,000 manufacturing workforce. 
Next in the urban hierarchy are Pusan 

and Daegu. With a population of 3.7 
million, Pusan is the Republic of Korea’s 
second largest city. In the southeastern 
corner of the Korean Peninsula, its sea-
port, one of the world’s largest, handles 
more than 6.5 million container ships a 
year. Daegu is a metropolitan area of 2.5 
million, dominated by textile and cloth-
ing manufacturing and automotive parts 
manufacturing and assembly. Since 1970, 
the Gyeongbu Expressway has connected 
Pusan to Seoul through Daegu. About 20 
fl ights operate daily between Seoul and 
Daegu, and since 2001, the two cities have 
been linked by a high-speed train. 

Much farther down the hierarchy, Ansan 
and Gumi are secondary cities, with popu-
lations of around 679,000 and 375,000, 
respectively. In Gyunngi province, Ansan 
belongs to the Seoul National Capital Area, 
as part of Seoul’s suburban area. Gumi is in 
Gyungbok province, in the southeast. As 
tends to be the case with secondary cities, 
Ansan and Gumi are more specialized in 

manufacturing, especially standardized 
manufacturing, than cities farther up the 
hierarchy. Although both cities serve as 
manufacturing centers, they diff er in their 
specializations. Gumi is heavily specialized 
in the radio, television, and communica-
tion equipment industry, which by itself 
accounts for more than 50 percent of local 
manufacturing employment. Ansan is 
specialized in such high-tech industries as 
electrical machinery and computers and 
offi  ce machinery. It also has agglomera-
tions in several heavy industries: almost 
14,000 workers, or 14.7 percent of the local 
manufacturing workforce, are employed in 
the fabricated metal products industry. 

At the bottom of the hierarchy, 

Jeongeup and Sunchang, both in the 
Jeonbuk province, are close to the inter-
face between rural and urban. So while 
 Jeongeup has a relatively large popula-
tion (129,050), one in four of its inhabit-
ants is a farmer. Likewise, Sunchang is a 
rural town: half of the 32,012 residents are 
farmers. To the extent that they exhibit 
any specialization in manufacturing, it 
is either in traditional resource-related 
industries, as in Jeongeup, or in the man-
ufacture of food and beverage products, 
as in Sunchang.

true for smaller cities and towns, and towns 
and rural areas. Towns are the connective tis-
sue between rural and urban areas. They act 
as market centers for agricultural and rural 
output, as stimulators of rural nonfarm activ-
ity, as places for seasonal job opportunities for 
farmers, and as facilitators of economies of 

scale in postsecondary education and health 
care  services.  Symbiosis  is  again  the  rule. 
Towns draw sustenance from the agricultural 
activity  of  rural  areas,  but  their  prosperity 
also spills over to villages by providing non-
farm employment opportunities. Farmers in 
Vietnam migrate seasonally to work in urban

construction, returning to invest the money 
earned in their farms.13 Farmers in Makueni, 
Kenya, use nonfarm income to invest in ter-
racing, planting trees, clearing bush, building 
houses, and educating their children. Farm-
ers in the semiarid Diourbel region of Senegal 
have responded to growing urban demand for 
meat by diversifying away from groundnut 
production into animal husbandry.14 

Measuring density
Measures of gross product at a reﬁ ned spa-
tial  scale,  such  as  a  district  or  a  city,  are 
difﬁ cult  to  come  by.  Even  for  developed 
countries,  output  estimates  tend  to  be 
available  only  for  rather  broadly  deﬁ ned 
subnational areas (ﬁ rst level and adminis-
trative units, such as provinces or states). At 
this level, important variations in economic 
density are likely to average out. Fortunately 
though, as illustrated earlier for Belgium, 
output and population density are closely 
correlated.  Reliable  population  estimates 
are more easily available, even for villages 
or townships, because in most countries, a 
population census is taken every decade.

The strong correlation between popula-
tion density and economic mass is consistent 
with urban areas being a conglomeration of 
consumers and producers, of buyers and sell-
ers, and of ﬁ rms and workers. For a typical 
metropolitan area, the gradient of popula-
tion density for distance from the city center 
is similar to the corresponding gradient for 
employment density.15 As implied above, the 
extent to which a country’s population lives 
in urban areas bears a strong relationship to 
how  “bumpy”  its  economic  geography  is. 
Density  goes  from  smoothly  spread  out  to 
quite uneven as a country develops. Urban-
ization is thus synonymous with a tendency 
toward greater agglomeration within a coun-
try. A country’s urban share is a good proxy 
for the proportion of its population living in 
areas of high density and, therefore, for the 
“bumpiness” in its economic geography. 

This  Report  proposes  the  use  of  an 
agglomeration index computed using geo-
graphic information systems as a measure 
of  density.  Measures  of  urbanization  are 
nonuniform across countries, which makes 
comparability and aggregation a challenge. 
The index allows for a more consistent com-
parison  of  the  level  of  urbanization—or, 

interchangeably,  agglomeration,  density, 
or  geographic  concentration  of  economic 
activity—across countries. 

The index identiﬁ es an area of 1 square 
kilometer as urban, agglomerated, or dense 
if it satisﬁ es the following three conditions:
(cid:129)  Its population density exceeds a thresh-
old (150 persons per square kilometer).
(cid:129)  It has access to a sizable settlement within 
some reasonable travel time (60 minutes 
by road). 

(cid:129)  The settlement it has access to is large 
in that it meets a population threshold 
(more than 50,000 inhabitants).

Box  1.3  summarizes  the  rationale  and 
methodology underpinning the index. 

One  advantage  of  the  agglomeration 
index  is  that  it  incorporates  both  density 
and the local distance to density. Based on 
the criteria of population density and acces-
sibility  to  a  sizable  market,  the  index  also 
comes closer to providing an economic deﬁ -
nition of an area that can both beneﬁ t from 
and contribute to agglomeration economies. 
Although economic density is both a cause 
and a consequence of agglomeration econo-
mies,  accessibility  to  this  economic  mass 
from the outer parts of the city facilitates the 
exploitation of such beneﬁ ts to proximity. 
This is especially true in the service sector 
in which face-to-face interactions are often 
necessary. By reducing the need to allocate 
valuable land area to residential uses in and 
near urban centers, transport infrastructure 
facilitates economic density. 

Going to work by car or by high-speed 
public transportation is a luxury that devel-
oped  country  commuters  do  not  always 
share with their counterparts in developing 
countries.  For  any  given  geographic  dis-
tance, therefore, accessibility to a city tends 
to be lower in developing countries because 
of the need to rely on alternative, more time-
intensive modes of transportation, such as 
walking, cycling, or inefﬁ cient public trans-
portation operating on poor-quality roads. 
In Mumbai, India, 44 percent of people walk 
to  work,16  and  in  Hefei  City,  China,  more 
than 70 percent either walk or cycle.17

Such  variations  in  accessibility  deter-
mine  both  the  shape  and  form  of  a  city. 
When  most  people  walk  to  work,  a  city  is 
more likely to be monocentric and densely

BOX 1.3    Computing the agglomeration index

The United Nations maintains the World 
Urbanization Prospects database, a trea-
sure trove of information. It provides 
urban shares and population data for 
229 countries stretching back to 1950. 
But these data are based on country 
defi nitions, which can be quite diff erent. 
This Report proposes a new measure of 
agglomeration, based on a uniform defi -
nition of what constitutes an “urban” or 
agglomerated area, using the technique 
outlined in Chomitz and others (2007) and 
elaborated in Uchida and Nelson (2008).
This should not be read as implying 
that World Urbanization Prospects data 
are fl awed. A better interpretation is to 
see the challenge of measuring urbaniza-
tion as analogous to the measurement 
of poverty. Each country has its own 
poverty line and criteria to track changes 
in national poverty rates. But these mea-
sures do not allow reliable comparisons 
of poverty between countries, and they 
cannot be used to aggregate poverty 
for groups of countries. The merit of 
a uniform poverty measure—such as 
those living below US$1 or US$2 a day, 

adjusted for purchasing power diff er-
ences between countries—is that it 
allows international comparisons and 
calculations that aggregate poverty for 
regions and the world. The agglomera-
tion index allows the same comparisons 
and aggregation. 

The methodology underlying the cal-
culation of the agglomeration index can 
be summarized as follows:

•  Specify thresholds. To be classifi ed as 

“urban” using the agglomeration index, 
an area must satisfy three criteria based 
on (1) minimum population size used 
to defi ne a sizable settlement, (2) mini-
mum population density, and (3) maxi-
mum travel time, by road, to the sizable 
settlement.

•  Locate the centers of sizable settlements. 

This mapping is done for cities that 
meet the minimum population size 
criterion using data from the Global 
Rural-Urban Mapping Project (GRUMP) 
human settlements database.a

•  Determine the sizable settlement’s bor-
der. The border surrounding a sizable

on the maximum travel time to the

•  Create population density grids. These 

are created at a 1-kilometer spatial 
resolution using two global grid-based 
population data sources, GRUMP and 
LandScan.b
Identify the areas. Identify the grid cells 
that satisfy thresholds for all three criteria.

• 

•  Aggregate grid cell populations. The 
result is analogous to urban popula-
tion. The proportion of this number to 
that country’s total population is the 
agglomeration index, a summary mea-
sure of the proportion of the popula-
tion living in areas of high density.

In calculating the index, this Report uses 
a base case set of thresholds of 50,000 for 
minimum population size of a settlement, 
150 people per square kilometer for pop-
ulation density, and 60 minutes for travel 
time to the nearest large city. 

The density and travel time thresh-
olds are those employed in Chomitz, 
Buys, and Thomas (2005). The density 
 threshold is the same as the one used 
by the Organisation for Economic Co-
operation and Development (OECD). The 
threshold of 50,000 for a sizable settle-
ment is reasonable for developing and 
developed countries. Many developing 
nations have more than 10 percent of 
their total population in urban centers 
of between 50,000 and 200,000. Some 
examples include Chile in 2002, Brazil 
in 2000, and Malaysia in 2000, all with 
around 17 percent of their national 
population living in urban centers of 
50,000–200,000 inhabitants. Of India’s 
urban population in 2001, 20 percent 
lived in settlements of this size. 

According to the World Urbanization 

Prospects database, the worldwide urban 
share in 2000 was 47 percent. Using the 
base case criteria, this ratio is 52 percent, 
but using 100,000 as the minimal settle-
ment size, it is 44 percent, according to 
the agglomeration index. But country 
level estimates can be further apart (see 
fi gure at left). 

populated at its core. In Mumbai, half of all 
workers  commute  less  than  2  kilometers, 
implying that they live close to their places of 
work. Similarly, to obtain the advantages of 

agglomeration in industrial districts, work-
ers in nineteenth-century Britain had to live 
nearby. The centers of industrial towns were 
densely populated, and overcrowded housing

was common. Not until the electric tram was 
introduced did this change. 

In determining accessibility, and thus the 
shape and form of cities, features of physical 
geography can also be important. Manhattan 
Island in New York City is difﬁ cult to get to, 
simply because of geography, so it has sky-
scrapers and a classic monocentric structure, 
with half its employment within a three-mile 
radius  of  Wall  Street.  By  contrast,  in  Los 
Angeles, one has to widen the area to a radius 
of 11 miles from the center to ﬁ nd as large 
a  share  of  employment.18  The  implication: 
economic density in New York City is $1.44 
billion of gross product per square kilometer, 
in Los Angeles it is $0.49 billion.19 

In the United Kingdom, Stevenage, Basil-
don, and Crawley are commuter towns that 
serve  London.  About  11  percent  of  Lon-
don’s GDP is generated by commuters from 
suburban areas.20 Similarly, in the United 
States, a daily tide of workers commute into 
Washington,  D.C.,  from  the  neighboring 
states of Maryland and Virginia. In 2005 the 
net contribution of commuters from these 
two  states  to  Washington,  D.C.’s  output 
was $36.4 billion. Maryland’s Montgomery 
County—within easy commutable distance 
of the district—alone contributed $6.4 bil-
lion to Washington’s gross product.21 

The biggest advantage of the agglomera-
tion index is its comparability across coun-
tries. Here the index has an advantage over 
the  United  Nations’  World  Urbanization 
Prospects database, which contains the “de 
facto  population  living  in  areas  classiﬁ ed 
as urban according to the criteria used by 
each area or country.”22 The heterogeneity 
across countries can makes cross-country 
comparisons misleading. A few examples:
(cid:129)  India.  With  the  criterion  for  an  urban 
area  used  by  Zambia  or  Saudi  Arabia, 
deﬁ ned as settlements with populations 
of  5,000  or  more,  the  share  of  India’s 
population in urban areas in 1991 would 
be 39 percent instead of the ofﬁ cial ﬁ gure 
of 26 percent. This is because 113 mil-
lion inhabitants of 13,376 villages would 
be reclassiﬁ ed as urban. 

(cid:129)  Mexico. Based on Mexico’s ofﬁ cial cri-
terion  of  settlements  of  2,500  or  more 
as urban, the country’s urban share in 
2000 was 74.4 percent. But if the settle-
ment  population  threshold  were  to  be 

redeﬁ ned as 15,000 (Nigeria and Syria, 
for example, have cutoffs of 20,000), that 
share would drop to 67 percent.

(cid:129)  Mauritius.  In  2000  about  a  quarter  of 
Mauritius’s  population  lived  in  settle-
ments  with  between  5,000  and  20,000 
inhabitants. Some of these settlements 
are  district  capitals,  but  none  of  them 
are classiﬁ ed as urban. If they were, the 
urban share would have been more than 
two-thirds rather than less than half.

At  a  regional  level,  according  to  World 
Urbanization  Prospects  data,  South  Asia 
poses the paradox of being the least urban-
ized region (27 percent urban) in the world 
while also the most densely populated. Using 
the agglomeration index, South Asia’s urban 
share in 2000 was 42 percent, making it more 
urbanized  than  both  Sub-Saharan  Africa 
and  East  Asia  and  the  Paciﬁ c  (ﬁ gure  1.3). 
The World Urbanization Prospects also pose 
a puzzle for Latin America and the Carib-
bean. The urban share in this region in 2000 
was greater than that in Eastern Europe and 
Central  Asia  and  almost  on  par  with  the 
OECD’s. The OECD has an average GDP per 
capita more than six times that of the aver-
age Latin American country. More reason-
ably, the agglomeration index indicates that 
Latin  America  and  the  Caribbean’s  urban 
share in 2000 was similar to that of Eastern 
Europe and Central Asia, and 15 percentage 
points lower than that of the OECD.

Despite  these  drawbacks,  the  World 
Urbanization Prospects data are the only avail-
able information for comparisons over time. 
The agglomeration index is available only for 
2000, because time-series data on road net-
works, necessary to estimate travel time, are 
not readily available. So, the agglomeration 
index and World Urbanization Prospects data-
base should be considered as complementary 
data  sources  for  examining  urbanization 
and density, and this Report uses both the 
agglomeration index and the World Urbaniza-
tion Prospects data.23 Calculating comparable 
urban share measures for at least some coun-
tries in the past is possible; going forward, it 
should be a priority for all countries. 

Economic concentration—
the richer, the denser
In the early stages of development, when an 
economy is primarily agrarian, people live

spread  out  on  farmland.  Even  the  largest 
towns and cities are small. Urban settlements 
are likely to be small port cities and market 
towns, serving the rural needs and trading 
surpluses  of  agriculture.  Industrialization 
brings with it a rapid process of urbaniza-
tion—new cities are born, and existing cities 
expand. As people crowd into these cities at 
a faster rate than their boundaries expand, 
population and economic density increase. 
Quite early in a country’s development, this 
leads to a hierarchy of places. 

So,  two  transitions  characterize  eco-
nomic  development.  The  first  involves 
the  movement  from  a  primarily  agrarian 
economy to a much more manufacturing-
oriented economy. The second transition, 
taking place at a much higher level of devel-
opment,  involves  the  transformation  to  a 
service-oriented economy. The ﬁ rst phase 
of  urbanization,  which  occurs  at  a  faster 
rate,  coincides  with  the  transition  from 
a rural to an urban economy. The second 
phase of urbanization, at a slower rate and a 
much higher level of development, is linked 
to a within-urban evolution. In most coun-
tries, these transformations happen at the 
same time but in different areas. 

To  measure  concentration,  we  have  to 
deﬁ ne  an  area.  The  policy  debate  often 
involves  a  discussion  of  urban  primacy, 
such as whether developing country cities 
are  too  big  or  too  small.  More  academic 
discussions use a purer geographic notion 
of  space.  This  chapter  uses  both  spatial 
units—primary cities and the densest grid 
cell of 1° longitude by 1° latitude of a coun-
try—to measure concentration. 

Historically, rapidly rising 
concentration, then a leveling off
By one deﬁ nition, a city is a geographic area 
characterized  by  a  concentration  of  eco-
nomic actors.24 Globally, the top 30 cities, 
ranked by GDP, generated around 16 per-
cent of the world’s output in 2005, while the 
top  100  generated  almost  25  percent.  The 
urban  agglomerations  of  Tokyo  and  New 
York have estimated GDPs (in purchasing 
power  parity)  broadly  similar  to  those  of 
Canada  and  Spain,  respectively,  whereas 
London has a higher estimated GDP than 
either Sweden or Switzerland. Similarly, pri-
mary cities in developing countries account

for disproportionate shares of their national 
GDP. In 2005, Mexico City contributed 30 
percent of Mexico’s GDP despite occupying 
only 0.1 percent of its land. Luanda contrib-
uted a similar share of Angola’s GDP, while 
occupying  0.2  percent  of  its  land.  Like-
wise, the largest cities in Hungary, Kenya, 
Morocco,  Nigeria,  and  Saudi  Arabia—
Budapest, Nairobi, Casablanca, Lagos, and 
Riyadh—contributed  about  20  percent  of 
their country’s total GDP while taking up 
less than 1 percent of land.25 

Density,  deﬁ ned  as  GDP  in  purchasing 
power  parities  per  square  kilometer,  rises 
with the level of development, and the dens-
est places in the world are in the richest coun-
tries. Dublin, London, Paris, Singapore, and 
Vienna ranked at the top, in 2005, with more 
than $200 million in gross product per square 
kilometer. Likewise, Tokyo- Kanagawa, New 
York–New  Jersey,  Oslo– Akershus-Vestfold, 
and Vienna-Mödling were the densest grid 
cells of 1° longitude by 1° latitude, generating 
more than $30 million of gross product per 
square kilometer (ﬁ gure 1.4). 

A  century  of  data  on  aggregate  urban 
shares,  and  two  centuries  of  population 
estimates  for  primary  cities,  suggest  that 
urbanization is initially rapid before slowing. 
Developing  countries—especially  those  in 
Africa and Asia—are at phases during which 
urban  shares  increase  sharply.  People  in 
Western Europe and North America, which 
went through the same phase a century ago, 
have  understandably  forgotten.  Emerging 
economies such as the Republic of Korea that

developed rapidly provide the best case stud-
ies for understanding the pace and pattern of 
geographic concentration. Their experience 
traces the initially rapid and the more grad-
ual growth of today’s wealthiest nations. 

At the aggregate level, using the popula-
tion shares in urban areas, the urbanization 
pattern  of  developing  countries  in  Asia, 
Africa,  Middle  East,  and  Latin  America 
over the last 50 years closely tracks the ﬁ rst 
part of the historic path earlier traversed by 
OECD  countries  between  1900  and  2000 
(ﬁ gure 1.5). The urbanization in Asia mir-
rors  the  rapid  phase  of  urbanization  that 
OECD countries experienced in the nine-
teenth  century.  Likewise,  the  geographic 
transformations in Latin America and the 
Caribbean, in Eastern Europe and Central 
Asia,  and  in  the  Middle  East  and  North 
Africa  are  qualitatively  similar  to  those 
experienced by the OECD in the ﬁ rst phase 
of urbanization. Quantitatively, the urban 
shares  for  Latin  America  and  the  Carib-
bean and for Eastern Europe and Central 
Asia regions are higher than those for the 
OECD at comparable incomes. 

This may, however, be an artifact of the 
data.  Data  from  the  World  Urbanization 
Prospects database systematically overstate—
purely as a deﬁ nitional matter—the urban 
shares of Latin America and the Caribbean, 
Eastern Europe and Central Asia, and Sub-
Saharan Africa. The safest conclusion may 
be  that  the  pattern  of  urbanization—the

BOX 1.4    Africa’s urbanization reﬂ ects industrialization

Between 1970 and 1995, the urban popula-
tions in Sub-Saharan Africa were growing 
at 5.2 percent a year while their GDP per 
capita was shrinking at 0.66 percent a year. 
Since the work by Fay and Opal (2000), 
many have argued that urbanization does 
not necessarily accompany development, 
with Sub-Saharan Africa in mind (Com-
mission for Africa 2005). But Satterthwaite 
(2007) questions the validity of the urban 
population numbers in most studies. Since 
many were based on projections, some 
may have been grossly overestimated. 

The problem is the lack of regular popula-
tion censuses. For Chad and Eritrea the pop-
ulation projections spanning 1950 through 
2030 were based on one population census. 
Those for the Democratic Republic of Congo 
were derived from two observations, the 
most recent for 1984. It is thus reasonable 
to consider only countries with at least 
two censuses during the period examined 
(1970–95), a census post-2000 for more accu-

rate population estimates, a population of at 
least 1 million in 1995, and data on sectoral 
value added for 1970 and 1995. 

This whittles the sample down to just 10 

countries: Benin, Botswana, Central Afri-
can Republic, Ghana, Mauritania, Niger, 
Rwanda, Senegal, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. 
Of these 10 countries, fi ve experienced 
confl ict at least once, and the other fi ve 
were peaceful throughout the period. The 
results do not appear to diff er systemati-
cally between these two sets of countries. 
The main fi ndings follow:

•  Except for Botswana, the countries 
experienced on average a doubling 
of population, but only 60 percent 
cumulative growth in GDP. Population 
growth outpaced increases in gross 
value added, and GDP per capita fell. 

•  Urban population growth and total 

GDP growth are positively correlated. 
Countries with the fastest growth 

in total GDP—a doubling of their 
economies—also witnessed the fastest 
growth in urban population—a four-
fold increase. The leaders in the sample 
were Benin and Zimbabwe. 

•  The pace of urbanization was positively 

correlated with growth in industries 
and services, activities predominant in 
urban areas.

These patterns do not support the claim 
of African urbanization without growth. 
In contrast, countries with higher GDP 
growth experienced faster urbanization, 
and rapid urbanization came hand-in-
hand with higher growth in industries 
and services. A counterfactual of an Africa 
without urbanization is one with even 
slower economic growth, greater GDP per 
capita losses, and increases in poverty.

2007; United Nations 2006c.

relationship between economic growth and 
urbanization—is not unprecedented. Even 
in Sub-Saharan Africa, faster urbanization 
between 1970 and 1995, albeit with negative 
GDP per capita growth, was associated with 
higher total GDP growth. Urbanization also 
came  hand-in-hand  with  rapid  growth  in 
industries and services (see box 1.4).

At  a  disaggregated  level,  the  primary 
city’s  population  share  of  a  country  dis-
plays a similar, nonlinear pattern of initially 
rapidly rising concentration, followed by a 
subsequent leveling (ﬁ gure 1.6). This inten-
siﬁ cation of economic mass within a coun-
try’s  largest  cities  is  seen  for  a  wide  range 
of  incomes,  from  Budapest,  Cairo,  Kuala

concentration, then a leveling off
A similarly shaped pattern reappears in con-
temporary comparisons between a country’s 
level of development and the concentration of 
density. During 2000–05, the average urban 
population growth for low-income countries 
was  3  percent  a  year—faster  than  upper-
 middle-income countries at 1.3 percent and 
high-income  countries  at  0.9  percent.  The 
relationship is robust. It holds for a variety 
of concentration measures, ranging from the 
agglomeration  index,  to  population,  gross 
product, and household consumption den-
sity. It is robust to geographic scale: an area 
of 1 square kilometer, a city, a grid cell of 1° 
 longitude by 1° latitude, and an aggregated 
urban sector. 

Local  1-square  kilometer  areas.  Esti-
mated  agglomeration  indexes  produce  a 
pattern similar to the historical time series: 
rapidly rising density for countries during 
the early phase of urbanization (ﬁ gure 1.7).

urban share and development holds until 
a GDP per capita of around $10,000. This 
incipient urbanization is associated with a 
rapid shift in the number of people moving 
from  rural  to  urban  areas.  Subsequently, 
the pace of urbanization slows and density 
levels off as the urban share surpasses 60 
percent,  and  the  level  of  GDP  per  capita 
surpasses $10,000. With only a handful of 
exceptions, countries with GDPs per capita 
above $25,000 have an agglomeration index 
above 70 percent.  

Administratively  deﬁ ned  areas.  Tak-
ing  individual  cities  as  the  geographic 
unit, a positive concave relationship exists 
between  a  country’s  level  of  development 
and its primacy—the share of urban popu-
lation living in the country’s primary city, a 
widely used concentration measure. Similar 
to the relationship between agglomerations 
and the level of development, primacy also 
rises rapidly before stabilizing during the 
latter stages of urbanization (see ﬁ gure 1.8, 
panel a). Population and output density are 
highly  correlated,  but  population  density 
understates  the  geographic  concentration 
of economic mass. Agglomeration econo-
mies,  the  beneﬁ ts  that  ﬁ rms  and  workers 
enjoy as a result of proximity, make it likely 
that output density will increase more than 
proportionately with employment or popu-
lation density. 

1°  longitude  by  1°  latitude.  Using  the 
terrestrial grid cells to estimate concentra-
tion as the share of the densest cell’s gross 
product in the country’s GDP, concentra-
tion of economic mass rises rapidly among 
countries with a GDP per capita of less than 
$15,000, and then stabilizes and tapers off 
among higher-income countries (see ﬁ gure 
1.8, panel b). 

Urban  areas  of  countries.  Concentra-
tion  measured  by  consumption,  rather 
than  by  population  or  GDP,  suggests  the 
same concave relationship with the level of 
development. For instance, the urban shares 
of household consumption in Malawi and 
Cameroon at GDPs per capita of $150 and 
$700,  respectively,  are  36  percent  and  48 
percent. At about 63 percent, the shares are 
higher for Jordan and the Arab Republic of 
Egypt with GDP per capita of around $1,600, 
and rise to 80 percent in Panama and Poland

A portfolio of bigger and denser places
It follows from these stylized facts of geo-
graphic  transformation  that  high-income 
countries have a portfolio of places with a 
higher proportion of large settlements and 
a  lower  proportion  of  small  settlements 
than do middle-income countries. And the 
 middle-income  countries  have  a  signiﬁ -
cantly  higher  proportion  of  medium-size 
settlements than do low-income countries. 
In  low-income  countries,  about  three-
 quarters  of  the  population  live  in  small 
settlements  of  less  than  20,000  people, 
and only 10 percent live in urban agglom-
erations of more than 1 million people. In 
high-income countries, the opposite is true. 
Less than a quarter of the population live in 
small settlements of less than 20,000 peo-
ple, and about half of the population live in 
settlements of more than 1 million people 
(see table 1.1). 

At  an  incipient  stage  of  urbanization, 
the portfolio of places in a small country 
or part of a larger country, such as a prov-
ince or even a large district, can be approxi-
mated as 75 percent rural and 25 percent 
urban, all settlements of relatively low den-
sity. As urbanization accelerates—still pre-
dominantly a rural-urban transformation 
driven by industrialization—and the area 
or province grows toward a GDP per capita 
of $10,000, its distribution of settlements 

will approximate a 50/50 urban-rural split. 
During more advanced urbanization—now 
a within-urban transformation in a postin-
dustrial area—the distribution of popula-
tion  can  be  approximated  as  75  percent 
urban and 25 percent rural. 

This generalization corresponds well to 
the experience of the United States. In 1690, 
when the average GDP per capita was a mere 
$500 (1990 international dollars),27 the pri-
mary city in colonial British America was 
Boston. With a population of 7,000, how-
ever, Boston was by modern-day standards 
little bigger than a small town. In the urban 
hierarchy, only three other cities had popu-
lations greater than 2,500, two of them New 
York and Philadelphia. The early phase of 
American industrialization brought with it 
an increase in the urban share from 7 per-
cent in 1820 to 20 percent in 1860, as GDPs 
per capita rose from $1,257 to $2,170 (1990 
international dollars). During this time, the 
population of the primary city, now New 
York, expanded from 123,706 to 805,651. Its 
rapid growth allowed the urban hierarchy 
to expand and stretch out.

The number of cities with a population 
greater than 1 million increased from just 
one, New York, in 1820 to nine in 1860. All 
these  cities  were  in  the  Northeast,  where 
industrialization began. As the geographic 
transformation  wore  on,  and  the  United 
States completed its transition to a mature 
industrial economy, population density in a 
consistent sample of U.S. cities with popu-
lations greater than 25,000 increased from 
7,230 persons per square mile to 8,876 per 
square mile. The average land area of a city 
increased from about 19 square miles to 40 
square miles.28 Cities became more packed 
and more sprawling at the same time. 

Convergence—rural-urban and 
within cities
A “bumpy” economic geography distributing 
production and people unevenly across the 
space in a country is a natural feature of the 
working of a market economy. This bumpi-
ness tends to become more pronounced as a 
country develops. The question often asked 
is: what does this do to the geographic distri-
bution of poverty, consumption, and other 
living standards? The answer can determine 
the political and social sustainability of the 
process of concentration. 

Rural-urban disparities in well-being—
ﬁ rst wide, then narrow
Rural-urban  disparities  in  productivity, 
wages, and well-being can be expected to be 
large and increasing in the earlier stages of 
development.  With  the  rapidly  increasing 
concentration of economic mass in a coun-
try’s towns and cities in the earlier stages of 
development, signiﬁ cant disparities in pro-
ductivity,  wages,  and  basic  welfare  occur 
between urban and rural areas. The agglom-
eration of capital, consumers, and workers 
quickly brings production advantages, and 
transport  costs  restrict  the  beneﬁ ts  to  the 
locality.  These  larger  local  markets  enable 
ﬁ rms to spread the ﬁ xed costs of production 
across a wider number of consumers, pro-
ducing cost and productivity advantages.29 
This means higher wages in towns and cities, 
and greater availability of a more diversiﬁ ed 
range of goods and services. 

The concentration of mass also helps to 
ensure a better supply of basic infrastructure 

and public health facilities in urban areas. 
Along with diverging wages, this promotes 
divergence in more basic measures of wel-
fare between urban and rural areas.30 But 
rural-urban disparities begin to narrow as 
the  urbanization  process  slows,  and  gov-
ernments become more capable. The exo-
dus of people and workers from rural areas 
to  towns  and  cities  reduces  surplus  labor 
from the land in agriculture—and reduces 
competition between workers in rural labor 
markets.  And  labor-saving  technological 
progress  releases  labor  for  migration  to 
urban areas and improves productivity. In 
time, investments and ﬁ scal redistributions 
give  rural  residents  better  local  access  to 
basic amenities, such as a clean daily source 
of running water, sanitation, and electricity, 
as well as schooling and health care. Indeed, 
with development and the passage of time, 
a  country’s  economic  geography  approxi-
mates  a  “natural”  balance  that  equalizes 
welfare between urban and rural residents. 
In this situation, people choose to live where 
they expect to be best off in material and 
nonmaterial well-being. The Islamic Repub-
lic of Iran illustrates this rural-urban con-
vergence (see box 1.5).

Evidence from today’s industrial coun-
tries suggests that development has largely 
eliminated  rural-urban  disparities.  High 
urban  shares  and  concentrated  economic 
density go hand in hand with small differ-
ences in rural-urban well-being on a range 
of indicators. The 15 countries that joined 
the European Union (EU) before 2004, all 
with GDPs per capita in excess of $13,000 
(1990  international  dollars),  consider  the 
unemployment  rate  an  important  policy 
target.31  But  rural-urban  unemployment 
differences  should  not  be  a  concern.  The 
unemployment  rates  are  10.1  percent  for 
urban areas, and 9.9 percent for rural areas. 
This is also evident for youth: 19.4 percent 
in  urban  areas  compared  with  18.7  per-
cent in rural areas. The rates of labor force 
participation in urban and rural areas are 
68.3  and  69.4  percent,  respectively.32  For 
England,  the  high  degree  of  rural-urban 
equality in well-being is reﬂ ected in similar 
disposable incomes: indeed, at £522, weekly 
disposable income in villages is 10 percent 
higher than the £476 in cities.33

BOX 1.5     Urbanization and narrowing rural-urban disparities in the Islamic Republic of Iran 

Rural-urban disparities have narrowed 
in the Islamic Republic of Iran. In 1976, 
on the eve of the Iranian revolution, the 
mean per capita household income in 
rural areas was 44 percent of that in urban 
areas. By 2005, it had increased to 63 
percent.

The Shah’s government favored cities 
over the countryside. Price controls for 
essential foods depressed agricultural 
incomes. High tariff s, import bans, and 
licensing for industrial goods propped 
up prices of manufactured goods and 
depressed farmers’ purchasing power. 
An inward-looking development strategy 
oriented toward fi nal domestic demand 
amplifi ed internal migration to Tehran 
and a few other large cities. For every 
indicator of development, the center per-
formed far better than the periphery. In 
1973, the poverty rate was 23 percent in 
the central region and 42 percent for the 
country. This spatial inequality matched 
the nation’s ethnic map, fueling  tensions. 
What has happened since the commit-

ment in 1979 to address spatial disparities? 

•  First, the share of the urban population 

has increased from 49 to 67 percent 
between 1979 and 2005. This is a con-
tinuation of a longer-term trend: the 
urban population had grown by 5.4 
percent per year (and in Tehran by 6 
percent) between 1966 and 1976.

•  Second, the rural-urban gap in house-
hold incomes has narrowed. Between 
1976 and 1984, agricultural value added 
grew by 31 percent, twice the rate of 
the nonoil economy. One reason for this 
growth was that farmgate prices rose 55 
percent. Another reason was that more 
was spent on projects to increase the 
productivity of small and medium-size 
farms. Growth could also be attributed 
to the fact that agricultural production in 
the Islamic Republic of Iran is dominated 
by the private sector, whereas large 
industrial enterprises and service provid-
ers were nationalized after the revolu-
tion, which hindered their effi  ciency. 
•  Third, rural and urban human devel-
opment indicators improved, even in 

the lagging provinces. Between 1976 
and 1996, the female literacy rate rose 
from 17 to 62 percent, while for urban 
women it rose from 56 to 82 percent. 
During 1994–2000, infant mortality 
and under-5 mortality fell fastest in the 
poorest provinces. 

•  Finally, overall poverty has fallen. The 

national poverty rate was at 8.1 percent 
in 2005, with relatively modest diff er-
ences in rural and urban poverty of 10 
and 7.1 percent, respectively. But pov-
erty rates still vary a lot between prov-
inces, ranging from 1.4 to 23.3 percent. 

The political commitment to spatial 
equity has produced mixed outcomes 
during the last 30 years: overall poverty 
declines and a convergence in rural-
urban standards of living, but persistent 
diff erences in interprovincial living stan-
dards.

nogov, Alexander Kremer, and others.

For  21  of  the  30  OECD  countries,  the 
higher  the  GDP  per  capita  in  2003,34  the 
lower the ratio of GDP per capita in predom-
inantly  urban  areas  to  that  in  rural  areas 
(see ﬁ gure 1.9).35 For the Czech Republic, 
Hungary, Poland, the Slovak Republic, and 
Turkey,  with  an  average  GDP  per  capita 
below $10,000 (1990 international dollars), 
GDP  per  capita  in  urban  areas  is  two  to 

three times higher. But for OECD countries 
with average GDPs per capita above $10,000, 
the ratio is between one and two (except for 
Norway).  Given  the  well-developed  ﬁ scal 
redistribution mechanisms in OECD coun-
tries,  and  differences  in  age-demographic 
proﬁ les  between  urban  and  rural  areas, 
these  disparities  in  GDP  per  capita  will 
overstate  rural-urban  differences  in,  say,

averages.

average levels of personal disposable income 
and consumption. The agglomeration index 
produces the same qualitative pattern. 

Rural-urban disparities in these countries 
were  wide  throughout  the  nineteenth  and 
early twentieth centuries. Wealth per male 
adult in nineteenth century Sweden was more 
than 200 percent higher in urban areas than 
in rural areas, and 150 percent higher in Fin-
land (see table 1.2). Meanwhile, for rapidly 
urbanizing England, urban wages were more 
than 70 percent higher than rural wages in 
the 1830s. France and the United States saw 
big  increases  in  the  urban  wage  premium 
from  1882  to  1911  and  from  1925  to  1935. 
Indeed, in the United States, the premium 
increased almost threefold in a decade.36 For 
developing countries in the nineteenth cen-
tury, including Australia, Denmark, France, 
Japan, and the United States, urban nominal 
wages were 50 percent higher. 

Today’s  developing  countries  are  still 
in  the  first  phase  of  urbanization  and, 
not   surprisingly,  have  large  rural-urban 

disparities  in  productivity  and  income. 
For a sample of developing countries in the 
1960s—among  them  Malaysia,  Mexico, 
and Trinidad and Tobago, which have since 
reached  upper-middle-income  or  high-in-
come status—urban wages exceeded rural 
wages by more than 40 percent. Similar gaps 
can be observed in per capita consumption 
between urban and rural areas for a recent 
sample of 72 developing countries. 

The  rural-urban  discrepancy  between 
economic mass and population distributions 
diminishes with urbanization. Another way 
to examine consumption disparities between 
urban and rural areas is to look at the popu-
lation share of a country’s urban areas and 
compare it with the share of consumption 
in  these  areas.  If  this  ratio  is  greater  than 
one, consumption per capita is, on average, 
higher in urban areas than in rural areas, 
while the converse is true if the ratio is less 
than one.

tion fall with density in today’s developing

countries (see ﬁ gure 1.10).37 In Malawi and 
Sri  Lanka  the  ratio  is  around  two:  urban 
areas  account  for  about  10  percent  of  the 
population but 20 percent of consumption. 
For countries with higher levels of urbaniza-
tion, the spatial distribution of population 
more closely resembles that of production. 
Madagascar and Tanzania have urban popu-
lation shares of around 20 to 25 percent and 
urban  consumption  shares  of  about  30  to 
35 percent. By the time a country enters an 
advanced stage of urbanization, population 
is more or less proportionately distributed 
with economic mass, so that the ratio is close 
to one. In Chile 85 percent of the popula-
tion reside in urban areas, and these urban 
residents account for 92 percent of national 
consumption. In Brazil 80 percent of people 
live in urban settlements, and these 80 per-
cent are responsible for 85 percent of con-
sumption. As development progresses and 
the  concentration  of  economic  activity  in 
areas of high density increases, rural-urban 
disparities narrow. A downward sloping line 
at all levels of urbanization is a good omen: 
most developing countries may have passed 
the peak in their rural-urban disparities.38

What is true for private consumption is 
true for basic amenities. Among low- income 
countries with urban population shares of 
less  than  25  percent,  access  to  water  and 
sanitation  in  towns  and  cities  is  around 
25 percentage points higher than in rural 
areas.39 But for more urbanized countries, 
such as Algeria, Colombia, and South Africa, 
the disparity in access is 15 to 20 percentage 

points. For countries where urbanization is 
advanced and the urban share is approach-
ing its natural maximum, almost no differ-
ence exists between urban and rural areas 
in access to basic services. Equalization of 
access to basic services can be expected to 
promote  a  corresponding  convergence  in 
nonmaterial indicators of welfare and liv-
ing standards (see table 1.3).

Narrowing  rural-urban  disparities  is 
important,  but  the  progress  in  absolute 
measures of basic welfare in the rural areas 
of the world’s poorest countries is even more 
important. Rising rural-urban disparities are 
consistent with an absolute improvement in 
basic welfare in both rural and urban areas. 
The overall evidence is encouraging. Over 
the past decade, most low- and middle-in-
come countries have experienced absolute 
improvements on a range of basic welfare 
indicators,  including  infant  and  under-5 
mortality  rates,  malnutrition,  immuniza-
tion, and school participation in rural and 
urban areas. Of 32 low-income countries, 
three-quarters reduced infant and under-5 
mortality rates and the incidence of severe 
stunting and severe underweight, especially 
in  rural  areas.40  And  since  1990,  school 
attendance  rose  in  four-fifths  of  these 
countries, especially in rural areas.41 Both

urban and rural areas in these nations have

Development Goals. 

Rural-urban  convergence  takes  place 
sooner  in  more  urbanized  subnational 
areas. In both China and the Philippines, 
urbanized provinces exhibit lower internal 
urban-rural disparities in incomes (see ﬁ g-
ure 1.11). In China the entire relationship 
has  shifted  upward  over  the  past  decade 
so that, in general, rural-urban disparities 
have increased over time, consistent with 
China’s early stage of development, which 
is marked by rapid urbanization. In India

both 1983 and 1994. But the entire relation-
ship has shifted downward over time. 

Slums—divergence and convergence 
within cities
In  poor  countries,  higher  average  living 
standards in cities do not rule out poverty 

and  deprivation.  Disparities  within  cities 
can be large. In Nairobi poverty is high in 
the inner city but much lower in the rest of 
the city and the suburbs (see ﬁ gure 1.12). In 
Mombasa,  Kenya’s  second-most-populous 
city,  marked  geographic  divisions  in  the 
poverty rate are evident (see map 1.2). South 
African cities also show internal disparities 
in  the  poverty  rate.  Cape  Town  has  a  low 
poverty rate in the coastal areas, but a higher 
poverty rate in the interior of the city. Simi-
larly, both Johannesburg-Pretoria-Tshwane 
and Durban have visible divisions. But the 
geography of poverty in Durban is different 
from that in Cape Town and Johannesburg: 
the poverty rate is, in general, higher outside 
the city boundaries than inside. 

The most obvious sign of divisions within 
cities is slums. Slums have chronically over-
crowded dwellings of poor quality in under-
served areas. The reason for the lack of basic 
public  services  and  infrastructure  is  the 
inability  or  unwillingness  of  many  urban

governments,  utilities,  and  service  provid-
ers to operate in slums, generally because of 
the informality and illegality of such settle-
ments.42  So  living  standards,  especially 
health, security, and sanitation, are lower in 
slums  than  in  formal  settlements  close  by. 
Mumbai’s Dharavi, believed to be Asia’s big-
gest slum, has “maybe a million residents . . . 
crammed into a square mile of low rise wood, 
concrete and rusted iron . . . a family of 12 liv-
ing in a 90-square-foot room.” In Shiva Shakti 
Nagar, again in Mumbai, each community 
tap is shared by roughly 100 people.43 

The  growth  of  slums  in  major  cities 
is  characteristic  of  rapid  urbanization. 
Because  rapid  population  growth  cannot 
be satisfactorily accommodated, slums and 
shantytowns grow bigger and more visible. 
This  contributes  to  wide  and  increasing 
geographic divisions in well-being within 
urban areas. Development—both economic 
and  institutional—and  better  infrastruc-
ture, combined with focused interventions, 
eventually bring about a convergence in liv-
ing standards in urban areas.

Slums are part of rapid urbanization, and 
it is not uncommon for a ﬁ fth to a third of 
a city’s population in a contemporary devel-
oping country to reside in slums (see ﬁ gure 
1.12).44 Goiâna, the capital of the Brazilian 
state of Goiàs, a medium-size city of 40,000 
in 1950, is today a city of more than 1 mil-
lion, with much of the population increase 
accommodated  in  slums.45  Since  1950, 
 Delhi’s  population  has  risen  more  than 
tenfold, from 1.4 million to 15.6 million,46 
accompanied by an increase in the number 
of slum clusters from 200 to 1,160. 

“A  dirtier  or  more  wretched  place  he

muddy, and the air was impregnated with

BOX 1.6    Slums, then and now

The term “slum,” probably originating 
from an old English or German word 
meaning a poorly drained or muddy 
place, was applied to housing in the 
early Industrial Revolution in the 
United Kingdom before the railways 
were in place, when canals trans-
ported heavy goods along the length 
and breadth of the country. During 
Britain’s rapid industrialization, most 
factories were built beside canals, the 
main channel for transporting coal 
for their steam engines and other 
inputs of production.

Poor workers, migrating to cities 
for factory jobs, could ill aff ord to 
walk long distances to and from their 
places of work. Before electric trams, 
other forms of transport were expen-
sive. So workers settled close to fac-
tories. Cheap housing grew around 
these factories in low-lying, poorly 
drained areas. Housing was over-
crowded. Sanitation was inadequate 
and in most cases nonexistent. And 
air quality was poor, with soot and 
other pollutants. Sickness was com-
monplace. Diarrhea, typhus, respira-
tory diseases, measles, and scarlet 
fever cut the life expectancy of those 
born in cities by 12 years compared 
with those born in rural areas.

The growing public health hazards 

in Britain’s urban slums exacted a 
terrible health toll that eventually 

reached out beyond the working 
class, fi nally motivating strong politi-
cal action. But rather than attempting 
to stop more workers from coming, 
or clearing out these areas of disease 
and poverty, the government in the 
1870s passed legislation for strict 
building regulations, prescribing the 
dimensions of streets and houses, and 
making it mandatory that all dwell-
ings be connected to newly built 
sewerage systems. Major municipal 
investments in water works, sewage 
facilities, and public health dramati-
cally reduced mortality in Britain’s 
cities between 1874 and 1907. 

Despite atrocious and fi lthy con-
ditions, millions of migrants keep 
leaving rural areas for the teeming 
economic opportunity off ered in the 
cities of poor and middle-income 
countries. Even though health hazards 
and mortality rates are far worse in the 
shanties around many cities in Africa, 
people there are trading, working, and 
sending large sums of money home. 
The challenge facing policy makers 
today is similar to that faced by the 
Victorians in London: how to nurture 
these agglomerations with functional 
land markets, better transport, and 
public health infrastructure to capture 
the benefi ts of economic growth.

or Rio de Janeiro’s Rocinha? No, this is an 
excerpt from Charles Dickens’s Parish Boy’s 
Progress, published in 1838, describing the 
rapidly  expanding  city  of  London  in  the 
nineteenth century (see box 1.6). 

London was by no means the only city 
or urban area in nineteenth century Britain 
with  large  slum  settlements.  Chronically 
overcrowded  and  inadequately  serviced 
housing  was  a  common  feature  of  British 
cities and industrial towns of the time. In 
Edinburgh rapid population growth and a 
ﬁ rst wave of suburbanization by the then-
rising  middle  classes  meant  that  by  the 
1860s, the core of the city had a large slum 
area with population densities as high as 600 
persons per acre. Residents in this area lived 

in multistory tenements arranged along nar-
row, unlit foot passages. This “housing was 
hopelessly  inadequate  in  all  respects—in 
quantity,  in  quality  and  environmental 
amenities,  if  needs  as  basic  as  clean  water 
and safe sewage disposal can be described as 
amenities.”47 Apart from the obvious mis-
ery, slums were prone to deadly outbreaks of 
measles and scarlet fever and high rates of 
mortality attributable to diarrheal diseases, 
typhus, and respiratory diseases.48

Yesterday’s slums are today’s world-class 
cities. Britain is not the only industrial coun-
try to suffer from slums and wide intracity 
divisions in welfare during the earlier phases 
of development and rapid urbanization (see 
box 1.7). The stylized pattern of divergence 
followed  by  convergence  is  a  hallmark  of 
other  modern-day  developed  countries  as 
well. Slums for these cities are now much a 
thing of the past. Aided by improving land 
markets, investments in infrastructure, and 
targeted incentives, within-city welfare dis-
parities tend to narrow, but only in the more 
advanced stages of urbanization. Indeed, for 
“world” cities such as London, New York, 
Paris, Singapore, and Tokyo, slums can, with 
the beneﬁ t of hindsight, be viewed as part of 
their “growing pains.” Britain cleaned up its 
Dark Satanic Mills over a century, and if it 
had started the cleanup sooner, the working 
class would have suffered from slower wage 
growth and lower consumption.49 

The emergence and growth of slums in 
the early and intermediate stages of a coun-
try’s development can be explained by the 
interaction  of  functioning  labor  markets 
with  dysfunctional  land  markets.  In  the 
rapid phase of urbanization, the labor mar-
ket signals higher labor demand in urban 
areas, the higher demand that arises from 
growth  in  industries  and  services.  Labor 
responds by moving to towns and cities. 

As a reﬂ ection of this, slum dwellers in 
developing countries are often productively 
engaged, taking advantage of the economic 
opportunities  the  city  offers.  Mumbai’s 
Dharavi  has  15,000  “hutment”  factories, 
and  “the  clothes,  pots,  toys  and  recycled 
materials its residents produce earn the fac-
tories millions of dollars a year.” Many slum 
residents started businesses after the state 
government  provided  them  with  limited

BOX 1.7    Many of today’s world-class cities were littered with slums

“In Antwerp and in most Belgian towns the 
basic problem in matters of working class 
housing was . . . no individual sanitation or 
individual water supply. . . . The three heavy 
cholera epidemics of the 19th century had 
terrifi c eff ects in these slums . . . “

“The fi rst encampments of Baltimore’s 
poor were at the water’s edge. Time and 
again, outbreaks of yellow fever, malaria, 
cholera, typhoid fever swept the town. 
These epidemics seemed peculiarly asso-
ciated with the low-lying encampments 
of the poor. The yellow fever epidemic of 
1797, for example, was said to have begun 
in the stagnant waters of the Fells Point 
cove and to have spread . . . to the huts 
and hovels on the banks of the Jones Falls 
and thence on to the shacks and shanties 
at the foot of Federal Hill.”

“By the 1890s, Polish immigrants had 
supplanted the Irish and Germans, creat-
ing a ghetto of a new dimension. Single 
dwellings housed from six to eight families, 
one [family] to a room. . . . Fells Point was 
described by a health offi  cial as an Augean 
stable . . . a mass of nuisance . . . Open 
drains, great lots fi lled with high weeds, 
ashes and garbage accumulated in the 
alleyways, cellars fi lled with black water, 
houses that are total strangers to the 
touch of whitewash or scrubbing brush, 
human bodies that have been strangers 
for months to soap and water . . . that’s 
Pigtown.” 

“The slums of Dublin were among the 

worst in Europe, rivaled only by Glas-
gow. Tall town houses, originally built as 
elegant homes for the rich in the eigh-
teenth century, fell into the Tomae hands 
of avaricious and pitiless landlords who 
fi lled them to bursting point with the 
desperate and impoverished urban poor. 
Conditions were often unspeakably vile, 
with massive over- crowding and utterly 
inadequate sanitation.”

“Katajanokka’s transformation in its 

entirety from a low-income housing area 
to an enclave for the city’s civil service 
elite and bourgeoisie represented an 
urban growth pattern that emerged for 
the fi rst time in the history of Helsinki. 
A former slum had become a prestigious 
residential area for the privileged classes.”

“Here the background embraces the 
pauper burial-ground, the station of the 
Liverpool and Leeds railway, and, in the 
rear of this, the Workhouse, the “Poor-Law 
Bastille” of Manchester, which, . . . looks 
threateningly upon the working-people’s 
quarter below. . . . Passing along a rough 
bank, among stakes and washing-lines, 
one penetrates into this chaos of small 
one-storied, one-roomed huts, in most of 
which there is no artifi cial fl oor; kitchen, 
living and sleeping-room all in one. In 
such a hole, scarcely fi ve feet long by six 
broad, I found two beds—and such bed-
steads and beds!—which, with a staircase 
and chimney-place, exactly fi lled the 
room.”

“Melbourne’s most infamous slum, 

Little Bourke Street, . . . by the 1880s . . . was 
crowded, bustling and growing. . . . The 
lane is completely fi lled up with all kinds of 
fi lth comprising garbage tips, putrid liquid, 
straw rags, and other rubbish. A most dis-
agreeable odor arose from this off ensive 
mass . . . the loathsome mass . . . exposed 
and allowed to rot and spread its contami-
nating infl uences.”

“About 200 years ago, Lower Manhat-

tan was adorned by a pretty fi ve-acre 
lake known as the Collect. . . . By the mid-
1700s, however, the Collect was already 
rimmed with slaughterhouses and tan-
neries. The eff usions from these bloody 
businesses were poured directly into the 
lake and more industries, more trash, 
quickly followed. By 1800 the Collect was 
a reeking cesspool. By 1813 it had been 
entirely fi lled in and by 1825 something 
entirely new stood on the site—America’s 
fi rst real slum, the Five Points.”

“Although this is a hugely expensive 

area in Paris to live today, in Victor Hugo’s 
day it was a slum area, close to the Bastille 
Prison.”

“[T]he lawyer Derville ventures into the 

slums of Saint Marceau, the poorest sec-
tion at the outskirts of Paris. Taking his 
coach through the fi lthy rutted lanes, he 
arrives at a broken-down building, made 
entirely of second-hand materials and 
poorly built, where Colonel Chabert is 
lodged with the cows, goats, rabbits and 
impoverished family of a former regimen-

tal soldier turned milkman, Vergniaud. 
There the Colonel lives in a single room 
with a dirt fl oor and a straw bed.”

“Between 1815 and 1851 France’s popula-

tion grew from 29 to 36 million . . . it was 
the cities that absorbed the thousands of 
migrants unable to fi nd work in the country-
side. . . . But there were simply not enough 
jobs. Unemployment and overcrowding cre-
ated appalling living conditions. Only one in 
fi ve houses had running water. In 1832 chol-
era wiped out some 20,000 Parisians.”

“Like so many other European cities, 

Paris suff ered from chronic post-war 
housing shortages. Of the 17 slum areas 
designed for clearance, most were still 
intact in the 1950s.”

“One of the worst outrages of indus-

trialism in China against humanity is the 
herding of these workers in noisome 
slums in the factory districts, . . . so foul 
and revolting . . . in Shanghai. . . . There 
are no sanitary provisions of any kind, and 
the passages between the rows of houses 
are practically open latrines. Overcrowd-
ing exists to a distressing extent. The 
many children who are reared in these 
fi lthy quarters are covered with running 
sores from dirt and bodily neglect.”

“In the 15 years between 1930 and the 
end of the war, the population of Singa-
pore doubled to a million people. The 
population explosion had generated a 
housing shortage of epidemic propor-
tions. Small shophouses gave shelter to 
as many as 100 people. The average living 
space was 9 feet by 9 feet, about the size 
of a prison cell.” 

“All of the ghettos of the 1920s within 

the city of Tokyo were products of Tokyo’s 
urban development and Japan’s modern 
economic growth. . . . The sheer size of these 
ghettos was astonishing. . . . Poverty pockets 
re-emerged in all parts of the metropolis of 
Tokyo after the Second World War, even in 
the midst of the old city of Tokyo.”

rights over their dwellings in 1976 and began 
to supply water and power to parts of the 
settlement. Because Dharavi is sandwiched 
between  the  city’s  two  main  railway  lines 
and is surrounded by six stations, it also acts 
as Mumbai’s transportation hub.50 In short, 
slums arise in many developing countries as 
low-income households take advantage of 
spatially concentrated employment oppor-
tunities and as businesses take advantage of 
their  location  in  a  land-constrained  envi-
ronment. Consistent with today’s industrial 
countries,  the  correct  response  is  not  to 
slow, stop, or reverse urbanization. It is to 
tackle dysfunctional land markets. 

The interplay of such market forces and 
responses from rational market actors can 
also be seen in many Sub-Saharan African 
countries.  But  inefficient  land  markets, 
often  thanks  to  misguided  urban  plan-
ning  and  zoning,  produce  only  a  limited 
and unresponsive supply of affordable, legal 
land sites for building housing to keep pace 
with the demand.51 

What’s different for today’s 
developers?
At the beginning of the nineteenth century, 
one person in every 10 in today’s developed 

European countries lived in urban settle-
ments of 5,000 inhabitants or more.52 In this 
respect, at least, little had changed from the 
previous ﬁ ve centuries. So the takeoff into 
urbanization over the next century broke 
dramatically from the past. 

The pace and pattern of urbanization 
is similar 
It started in Great Britain. In 1800 Britain’s 
urban  share  stood  at  19.2  percent,  about 
twice the European average. But in the ﬁ rst 
two decades of the century, the number of 
people  living  in  urban  areas  doubled.  By 
1820 the urban share was 40 percent. By the 
close of the century, seven of every 10 Brit-
ons were living in urban settlements. Britain 
was joined in its headlong rush into urban-
ization by other early European industrial-
izers. By the second half of the nineteenth 
century,  urbanization  spread  beyond  the 
Old World to the United States and Canada. 
By World War I, four of every 10 Americans 
were living in urban settlements with popu-
lations of 5,000 or greater; just 60 years ear-
lier, the ratio was one in 20.

So  if  anything  is  different  for  today’s 
developers,  it  is  certainly  not  the  pace  of 
urbanization. Indeed, the average pace of

urbanization for developing countries over 
1985–2005  is  remarkably  similar  to  the 
average  for  European  and  North  Ameri-
can countries53 between 1880 and 1900 (see 
ﬁ gure 1.13).54 For the early developers the 
average absolute increase in the urban share 
over the 20 years was 7.7 percentage points, 
and  for  current  developers  the  respec-
tive  median  and  mean  absolute  increases 
were  7.1  and  8.0  percentage  points.  The 
pace  of  urbanization  among  most  of  the 
early developers in the last two decades of 
the nineteenth century ranked in the top 
quartile of the contemporary distribution 
of urbanization speeds.

The volume of urbanization is greater 
for today’s developers
What then is different? One difference is the 
unprecedented absolute increases in urban 
populations in many developing countries 
in recent decades. Today’s developing coun-
tries  simply  have  larger  populations  than 
the  industrializing  countries  of  the  nine-
teenth and early twentieth centuries. The 
urban  population  today,  estimated  at  3.3 
billion, is far greater than the world’s total 
population as recently as 1960. It took more 
than 10,000 years for the urban population 
to reach 1 billion in 1960, 25 years to add 
the second billion, and only 18 to add the 
third.55 According to the UN projection, it 
will take just 15 years to add the fourth.56 In 
East Asia alone, 500 million people will join 
today’s 750 million urbanites over the next 
25 years, essentially adding another Paris or 
Kuala Lumpur every month.

Between  1985  and  2005,  China  added 
225 million people to its towns and cities, 
almost the entire population of the United 
States. Yet China for the same time period, 
ranked only ﬁ fteenth in its absolute increase 
in urban share. In India the number of peo-
ple in towns and cities rose by 137.8 million, 
adding a Germany and an Italy to its urban 
areas in just two decades. 

Today’s  developing  countries  had  an 
average  increase  in  their  urban  popula-
tion of 8.3 million over 1985–2005, almost 
three times the increase for many of today’s 
high-income European and North Ameri-
can countries between 1880 and 1900. But 
when China and India are excluded from 
the  group,  the  average  urban  population 
increase  in  recent  decades  has  only  been 
4.4  million,  about  50  percent  more  than 
the average for the early developers during 
1880–1900 (see ﬁ gure 1.14).57

Correspondingly,  megacities  in  devel-
oping countries are unprecedented in their 
size. Through the nineteenth century the 
world’s  largest  city  was  London.  But  its 
1900  population  of  6.6  million  was  only 
a  third  that  of  modern-day  Mumbai  or 
New Delhi, the largest cities in low-income 
countries. The London of 1900 and, indeed, 
even the London of today are also smaller 
than   modern-day  Shanghai  (10  million), 
the  largest  city  in  lower-middle-income 
countries,  and  several  others  (Cairo, 
Jakarta, and Manila) among the more suc-
cessful developers. With more than 22 mil-
lion people, Mexico City, the largest city in 
upper-middle- income  countries,  is  three

times the size of London at the start of the 
twentieth century.

Urbanites today enjoy both higher 
private earnings and better public 
services
Cities now do better than rural areas in both 
income and nonincome indicators of well-
being. In 2000 the infant mortality rate in 
rural Malawi was 117 per 1,000 live births, 
in  urban  Malawi  it  was  83.  Urban  Benin 
did much better than rural Benin in low-
ering under-5 mortality rates and reducing 
diarrhea and acute respiratory infections.58 
Urban Ugandan women were less likely to 
suffer from anemia or malnutrition. Supe-
rior health indicators are repeated in urban 
areas  throughout  the  developing  world—
from Chad and Cameroon in Sub-Saharan 
Africa, to Nepal in South Asia, Kazakhstan 
in  Central  Asia,  and  Nicaragua  in  Latin 
America,  and  to  Morocco  and  Egypt  in 
North Africa and Middle East.59

But the opposite was true for the devel-
opers of the nineteenth and early twentieth 
centuries.  Migrants  to  cities  could  expect 
better material standards of living, offset by 
poorer health and shorter lives for them and 
their children. In 1881–91 life expectancy at 
birth was 51 years in English and Welsh vil-
lages, but only 44 years in London and 39 
years in large towns.60 In 1850s Britain the 
infant mortality rate in cities with popula-
tions greater than 100,000 was, at 196 per 
1,000 live births, far higher than the 138 per 
1,000 live births in rural communities.61

Even as late as 1937, George Orwell saw it 
ﬁ t to characterize industrial towns and cit-
ies as places where “one always feels that the 
smoke and ﬁ lth must go on for ever and that 
no part of the earth’s surface can ever escape 
them.”62 It is perhaps no surprise, then, that 
the absence of respiratory diseases attribut-
able to poor air quality in the cities would 
have resulted in life expectancies 4.7 years 
longer in the England and Wales of 1861–70. 
In the absence of cholera, diarrhea, dysen-
tery,  and  typhus,  life  expectancy  might 
have been 1.7 years longer, and the absence 
of  measles  and  scarlet  fever,  common  in 
the  cities,  would  have  added  2.3  years  to 
life expectancy.63 Thus in the 1830s, while 

workers  in  London  earned  an  urban  real 
wage premium of 67 percent, a large part of 
this premium was compensation for the evi-
dent health hazards of city living.64 

In Germany during the second half of the 
nineteenth century, infant mortality rates 
in rural areas were about 150 per 1,000 live 
births. But expanding Berlin had the high-
est infant mortality in the Kaiserreich era, 
hovering around 300 per 1,000 live births in 
the 1860s, and peaking at 410 per 1,000 live 
births in the 1870s. The rural-urban gap in 
physical  well-being  remained  for  decades 
during the nineteenth century.65 

As the U.S. economy industrialized and 
urbanized,  people  living  in  high-density 
areas  at  the  turn  of  the  twentieth  century 
were  exposed  to  infectious  and  parasitic 
diseases. In 1880 urban mortality for adults 
was 50 percent higher than rural mortality, 
and two decades later, the urban mortality 
rate was still 18 percent higher. The rural-
urban mortality difference was even greater 
for infants and young children. For infants, 
excess  urban  mortality  was  63  percent  in 
1890 and 49 percent in 1900, and for young 
children ages one to four, the respective ﬁ g-
ures were 107 percent and 97 percent. In 1900 
male life expectancy was 10 years shorter in 
urban areas than in rural areas.66 

That  the  cities  and  towns  of  modern-
day  developing  countries  do  better  than 
villages on indicators of health, while the 
opposite was true for the developed coun-
tries at similar incomes in the nineteenth 
century, reﬂ ects advances in public health 
and medicine, and improvements in sewers 
and water systems. It also reﬂ ects the pub-
lic beneﬁ ts that today’s cities in developing 
countries confer. So the advantages of high 
density are not limited to income genera-
tion and wealth creation—they also include 
social services. 

With  these  differences  in  private  and 
public  sources  of  well-being,  it  should 
hardly be a surprise that cities and towns in 
the developing world are growing rapidly. 
The surprise is that this move to density is 
not faster. And the policy implication? Any 
strategy for a less desperate and more delib-
erate urbanization must include efforts to 
improve public services in rural areas.

CHAPTER 2

Deng Xiaoping, generally seen as the 

architect of China’s resurgence as 
an economic superpower, insisted 
on openness to world markets. He also insisted 
on concerted development of the country’s 
coastal areas, like Shanghai and Guangzhou, 
as launching grounds for connecting to these 
markets.  When  asked  about  the  growing 
wealth disparities between the coast and the 
interior,  he  reportedly  countered, “If  all  of 
China is to become prosperous, some [areas] 
must get rich before others.”

This  chapter  shows  that  all  successful 
developers support Deng’s insight. But his 
wisdom  may  have  eluded  leaders  in  the 
developing  world,  even  the  few  lauded  as 
visionaries, as later chapters in the Report 
will show. For decades, “spatially balanced 
growth” has been a mantra of policy mak-
ers in many developing countries. It was an 
obsession of planners in the former Soviet 
Union  (see  box  2.5).  And  it  has  been  the 
objective of governments of various politi-
cal  hues  in  the  Arab  Republic  of  Egypt, 
Brazil,  India,  Indonesia,  Mexico,  Nigeria, 
the Russian Federation, South Africa, and 
other great developing nations. There has 
even been a strong commitment to spatially 
balanced  development  in  the  economic 
history of many developed countries. The 
United  Kingdom  pursued  it  between  the 
late 1920s and 1980s,1 and Canada did so 
between the late 1950s and late 1980s.2 But 
in  these  cases,  even  with  the  popularity 
of these policies, Deng’s insight remained 
valid.

Indeed, the concentration of economic 
activity  and  the  convergence  of  living 

standards can happen in parallel. Develop-
ment in the United States was accompanied 
by a rapidly rising concentration of manu-
facturing activity in a relatively small area 
of  the  northeast  and  eastern  part  of  the 
Midwest at the turn of the twentieth cen-
tury.3 Throughout this process, U.S. states 
witnessed  a  slow,  if  sometimes  halting, 
convergence of per capita incomes.4 Today, 
roughly  half  of  the  U.S.  population  is  in 
only ﬁ ve states,5 but long-term unemploy-
ment  disparities  among  states  have  been 
fairly small since World War II.

The convergence of living standards in 
the United States has been assisted by the 
willingness  of  workers  to  “pull  up  their 
roots” and relocate.6 But basic welfare indi-
cators  have  converged  even  in  countries 
where such a willingness has been less evi-
dent, because development has been accom-
panied  by  the  spread  of  public  services. 
Take  France  and  Germany.  Even  though 
Paris generates 28 percent of France’s gross 
domestic product (GDP)7 using only 2 per-
cent of its land, infant mortality rates in the 
country  show  little  spatial  variation.  The 
lagging area of Lorraine had the highest rate, 
4.5 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2005, but 
this is not much higher than the national 
average  of  3.8.8  In  Germany  the  lead-
ing  area  of  Hamburg—with  an  economic 
density of €114 million of GDP per square 
kilometer—enjoyed a GDP per capita more 
than twice that of the northeastern lagging 
area of Mecklenburg- Vorpommern and an 
economic density more than one hundred 
times higher. Despite the phenomenal dif-
ferences in economic density between these

areas, there is no difference in basic welfare. 
The  numbers  of  physicians  and  hospital 
beds per 1,000 habitants in both Hamburg 
and  Mecklenburg-Vorpommern  closely 
track the national averages.9

This chapter presents stylized facts about 
economic concentration in parts of a country, 
usually called “leading areas,” and the con-
vergence in living standards between house-
holds in these areas and those in distant or 
disconnected parts, called “lagging areas,” in 
the same country. It introduces the concept of 
economic distance, which is related to but not 
the same as physical distance. When supple-
mented with the economic density discussed 
in chapter 1, distance helps characterize the 
spatial  transformations  that  accompany 
development and that may be necessary for 
rapid economic growth. 

The main ﬁ ndings:

(cid:129)  As countries develop and integrate inter-
nally,  location  matters  more  for  eco-
nomic activity but less for social welfare. 
Greater economic mass (which accumu-
lates where ﬁ rms carry out production) 
and higher living standards (reﬂ ected in 
household  consumption,  poverty,  and 
access to basic services) are not spatially 
synonymous. During the early phases of 
development,  infrastructure  and  social 
services tend to be conﬁ ned to areas of 
economic mass. But as countries develop 
and  integrate  internally,  the  distinc-
tion  between  leading  and  lagging  areas 
becomes sharper for economic mass and 
more blurred for living standards.

(cid:129)  The spatial concentration of economic 
activity  ﬁ rst  rises  and  then  levels  off. 
As  an  economy  changes  from  agrar-
ian  to  industrial,  the  spatial  distribu-
tion of people and economic production 
becomes more compact. Within a coun-
try,  agglomeration  and  city-periphery 
integration  give  rise  to  metropolitan 
areas  and  leading  areas  of  dense  eco-
nomic  mass.  This  process  eventually 
levels off, and the spatial distribution of 
economic activity stabilizes.

(cid:129)  Spatial disparities in living standards 
follow  an  inverted-U  path,  widening 
in  the  early  stages  of  economic  devel-
opment, and remaining high for a long 
period  before  slowly  converging.  As  a 

country  industrializes,  it  concentrates 
its  limited  initial  human  and  physical 
capital in leading areas, those with high 
growth  potential.  Areas  distant  from 
the new density lag. Spatial disparities 
in productivity and income can persist 
for generations, even with mobile labor 
and capital. History points to persistent 
spatial divergence in living standards in 
today’s developed countries in their ear-
lier stages of development, followed by 
slow convergence many years after they 
attained high income.10

(cid:129)  Technological  progress  and  globaliza-
tion  have  increased  market  potential 
in the leading areas of developing coun-
tries,  intensifying  concentration  and 
amplifying spatial disparities. Although 
the basic forces shaping the internal eco-
nomic geography of developing countries 
are the same as those that earlier shaped 
the economic landscapes of today’s devel-
oped  countries,  the  magnitudes  have 
changed. Larger international markets, 
better  transportation,  and  improved 
communication technologies mean that 
leading areas in open developing coun-
tries have greater market potential than 
industrial  countries  did  in  their  early 
development.  So  the  forces  for  spatial 
divergence between leading and lagging 
areas are now stronger.

Defining distance
Density, discussed in chapter 1, is also rele-
vant at the country level. Denser concentra-
tions of economic activity increase choice 
and opportunity. They ensure greater mar-
ket  potential  for  the  exchange  of  goods, 
services, information, and factors of pro-
duction. This chapter examines the dispari-
ties in economic mass and welfare between 
areas within countries, linking these dis-
parities to the distance from economic den-
sity. So while chapter 1 discussed changes 
at the local scale—where the most relevant 
spatial dimension is density—this chapter 
addresses the spatial transformations at the 
country scale, where both density and dis-
tance are relevant. Chapter 3 will propose 
that  although  density  and  distance  also 
matter for world regions, the most impor-
tant dimension at the international scale is

division—political barriers to the ﬂ ows of 
goods, entrepreneurship, people, and infor-
mation between nations.

As the crow ﬂ ies? Distance as an 
economic, not Euclidean, concept
Distance refers to the ease or difﬁ culty for 
goods, services, labor, capital, information, 
and ideas to traverse space. It measures how 
easily capital ﬂ ows, labor moves, goods are 
transported,  and  services  are  delivered 
between  two  locations.  Distance,  in  this 
sense,  is  an  economic  concept,  not  just  a 
physical one. Although economic distance 
is generally related to Euclidean (straight-
line) distances between two locations and 
the physical features of the geography sepa-
rating them, the relationship is not always 
straightforward. One reason is that distance 
for the exchange of goods is different from 
that for the migration of people.

For trade in goods and services, distance 
captures  time  and  monetary  costs.  The 
placement and quality of transport infra-
structure and the availability of transport 
can dramatically affect the economic dis-
tance between any two areas, even though 
the  Euclidean  distance  between  them 
could be identical. Two villages may have 
the  same  straight-line  distance  to  a  city, 
but one could be near a national highway, 
the other on an unpaved rural road. Based 
on straight-line distance, most of India is 

Map 2.1    Access to markets is not a straight line

well connected to markets in dense settle-
ments. But people in many parts of India 
have difﬁ culty getting to markets because 
of the travel time, determined by the type 
and  quality  of  roads  and  other  transport 
infrastructure (see map 2.1).

For labor mobility, distance also captures 
the “psychic costs” of separation from famil-
iar  territory.  Between  1985  and  1995,  the 
share of migrants in a Chinese province orig-
inating from another province fell as distance 
between the provinces increased. And addi-
tional costs exist for migration between non-
neighboring provinces.11 So, as with trade, 
economic distance for migration is related to, 
but not synonymous with, physical distance. 
In this Report, the destination of interest is a 
location with the greatest economic density 
or highest market potential. Distance is thus 
a metaphor for access to markets.

Manmade  barriers,  including  policies, 
can also increase distance. Roadblocks and 
local  barricades—improvised  “toll  sta-
tions” for local police and others to extract 
payments—are  common  for  journeys  by 
road  in  many  Sub-Saharan  countries.12 
And  where  local  political  autonomy  is 
high,  there  may  be  territorial  fragmenta-
tion as policies of protection are pursued 
at the local level. Map 2.2 shows the time 
to human settlements, assuming few or no 
manmade barriers. Distances can be long, 
even in high-income countries.

Locations close to markets have 
a natural advantage
Provincial  governments  in  1980  in  China 
heightened  their  administrative  powers 
under decentralization reforms. They used 
these powers to protect local ﬁ rms—raising 
tariffs and imposing bans on shipments from 
other provinces. Imports between provinces 
fell from 50 percent of GDP to 38 percent 
between 1992 and 1997, while local absorp-
tion of goods within provinces rose from 68 
percent to 72 percent. The magnitudes are 
similar to those for goods crossing the U.S.-
Canada border and international borders in 
the European Union (EU).13 China’s hukou 
system  of  permanent  household  registra-
tion—linking place of residence with access 
to  consumer  goods,  employment  oppor-
tunities,  and  social  protection—similarly 
reduced internal migration.14

Distance  to  density  affects  spatial 
movements  in  goods,  services,  informa-
tion, knowledge, and people. Commuting, 
migration,  telecommunication,  informa-
tion ﬂ ows, and shipments of goods connect 
originating and receiving areas. Most spa-
tial interactions, such as learning and trade, 
are beneﬁ cial. But some are harmful, such 

as the spread of disease. The main determi-
nant of the strength of these interactions is 
distance. Waldo Tobler’s First Law of Geog-
raphy  states  that  “everything  is  related  to 
everything else, but near things are more 
related than distant things.”15 Areas closer 
to economic density have easier access to 
beneﬁ cial interactions and exchanges.

In  Indonesia  better  road  connections 
shorten travel time and the distance to eco-
nomic  centers,  creating  larger  agglomer-
ated areas. Because of good roads and easier 
access  to  markets,  villages  60  kilometers 
from  the  district  center  generate  as  much 
manufacturing activity as the district cen-
ter itself, and the well-connected periphery 
becomes part of the agglomerated area. But 
in poorly connected peripheries, the density 
of economic activity falls off rapidly beyond 
25 kilometers from the center (ﬁ gure 2.1).

Spillovers from proximity to density show 
up in both developed and developing coun-
tries. In European manufacturing, an area’s 
total factor productivity growth is positively 
and  signiﬁ cantly  related  to  the  density  of 
manufacturing production in neighboring 
areas. And faster demand growth in neigh-
boring areas stimulates, through spillovers,

In  Canada,  North  York  and  Waterloo  are, 
thanks  to  proximity  and  local  research 
universities, becoming an extended part of 
the Toronto information and communica-
tion technology (ICT) hub. Firms closer to 
Toronto do better than those farther away.17
The phenomenon is repeated in emerg-
ing  economies.  When  a  network  of  high-
ways surrounding Jakarta was built in the 
1980s, many ﬁ rms moved out of the center 
to save on land and congestion costs. But 
they  stayed  near  the  metropolitan  region 
to have access to the large market.18 Similar 
but less pronounced is the pattern in other 
Indonesian agglomerations, where growth 
has been strongest in peripheral areas sur-
rounding  megacities.19  In  Brazil  indus-
tries moved out of greater São Paulo to the 
 lower-wage populated periphery. Following 
the  transport  corridors,  these  industries 
moved  through  São  Paulo  state  and  into 
the neighboring state of Minas Gerais. In 
the Republic of Korea the early decentral-
ization of manufacturing from Seoul was to 
peripheral locations within an hour’s drive. 
Only in the 1990s did industries decentral-
ize to towns and rural areas.20 

The natural way to reduce distance is 
for people to migrate
A leading area of dense economic activity, 
through  its  market  opportunities,  creates 
incentives  for  ﬁ rms  and  workers  to  move 

there. Responding to these incentives, ﬁ rms 
and workers enlarge the market opportuni-
ties available in the dense area. The result is 
a circular and cumulative process of dense 
areas continually gaining workers and ﬁ rms 
from less dense areas. In this process, migra-
tion balances the distribution of population 
against  the  spatial  disparity  in  economic 
density. Reducing distance-related costs or 
spatial  frictions  increases  movements  of 
people,  ﬁ rms,  and  ideas—as  well  as  those 
of goods and services—and thus brings less 
developed areas into the national system of 
production. With trade, the mobility of peo-
ple is probably the most potent mechanism 
for integrating areas of low economic density 
with markets of high density. But for inter-
nal migration to bring about a convergence 
in living standards, large population move-
ments may be necessary over generations.

Every  year,  approximately  40  million 
people  in  the  United  States  change  resi-
dences, and 8 million people change states.21 
The reason for this mobility is that economic 
production is concentrated in a few parts of 
the  country,  and  accessing  this  economic 
density generally means moving closer to it. 
People  moving  to  economically  dense 
areas contribute to production and boost 
their incomes. But they also increase com-
petition  among  workers  in  dense  areas, 
reducing it in less dense areas, and contrib-
uting to the convergence of living standards 
between low- and high-productivity areas.

Among  today’s  industrial  countries,  the 
quickest convergence occurred between 1870 
and 1913, largely driven by the largest ﬂ ows of 
people from Europe to emerging markets in 
Asia and the Americas. For Ireland between 
1851 and 1908, mass outmigration contrib-
uted at least a third to the catch-up in Irish 
real wages with those in the United States 
and  Britain—by  reducing  competition  in 
the domestic labor market. The virtual ces-
sation of catch-up or convergence among the 
industrial countries between the two world 
wars was attributed largely to more restric-
tive immigration policies.22,23

Density in leading areas, distance for 
lagging areas
Subnational areas, when compared, should 
ideally  be  deﬁ ned  according  to  economic 

criteria  that  correspond  to  fairly  self-
 contained labor markets and zones of eco-
nomic activity. But data on such functionally 
deﬁ ned  economic  areas  are  hard  to  come 
by.24  So  subnational  areas  are  more  com-
monly deﬁ ned by administrative or political 
boundaries. Such deﬁ nitions can bias econo-
metric analysis (see box 2.1), but they have 
the advantage of corresponding to the areas 
for deﬁ ning and implementing subnational 
policy. This chapter examines administra-
tively or politically deﬁ ned areas based on 
different data sources, ranging from national 
accounts and household surveys to terrestrial 
grid cells of 1° longitude by 1° latitude. 

In this Report, leading areas have a high 
economic density, and lagging areas have a 
long  distance-to-density.  An  area  is  more 
likely  to  be  lagging  the  farther  it  is  from 

BOX 2.1    Deﬁ ning an area: impossible or NUTS?

Subnational policy analysis relies on data 
for areas that range from small primary 
sampling units to districts, and to states 
or provinces. Typically, these areas are 
defi ned administratively or politically, 
refl ecting historical characteristics more 
than current patterns. For instance, the 
existing administrative structure of the 
EU’s member states generally consists 
of two levels, such as länder and kreise 
in Germany, regions and départements in 
France, comunidades autónomas and pro-
vincias in Spain, and regioni and provincie 
in Italy. The Nomenclature of Territorial 
Units for Statistics (NUTS) provides a single 
uniform classifi cation of territorial units 
for producing regional statistics for the 
EU. The fi rst two administrative levels 
in most member states correspond to 
NUTS 2 and NUTS 3. NUTS 1, a larger unit 
representing the major socioeconomic 
regions, often does not correspond to 
existing administrative units within mem-
ber states. 

Which spatial scale to use, or how best 
to defi ne a subnational area, depends on 
the issue and the information available. 
But the choice can dramatically aff ect the 
conclusions drawn from studying social 
and economic conditions across diff erent 
parts of a country—for two reasons. 
•  First, areas are not defi ned keeping in 

mind the policy issues. For instance, 

within-area diff erences in employ-
ment or poverty can be as large as 
between-area diff erences. Any change 
in the boundaries between areas 
could change the results. The potential 
implications are succinctly summa-
rized by the title of a classic paper on 
this topic, “A Million or So Correlation 
Coeffi  cients.”a 

•  Second, analytical fi ndings depend on 

the aggregation or spatial scale, the 
ecological fallacy of inferring charac-
teristics of individuals from aggregate 
data. The classic study by Robinson 
(1950) illustrates this problem.b A broader 
aggregation will yield smaller diff erences 
between units of analysis—and lower 
variances. So, results can diff er signifi -
cantly depending on the size of the units.

The fi gure below shows the density of 
economic activity for Germany’s 16 prov-
inces (länder) and 439 districts (kreise). 
The highly aggregated data indicate that 
30 percent of GDP is produced on 10 per-
cent of the country’s area, and the more 
disaggregated data show that almost 60 
percent of GDP is produced on the same 
10 percent. Aggregate information can be 
useful, but be mindful of these biases.

Distance

leading  areas  because  greater  distance-to-
density implies a lack of integration into the 
economy  of  leading  areas.  It  also  implies 
poorer access to the “thick” markets of capi-
tal, labor, goods, services, and ideas, and the 
spillovers of knowledge and information they 
provide. A lagging area is usually a remote 
part of the country with one or more of the 
following  features:  high  poverty,  low  pro-
ductivity and income, high unemployment, 
and stagnant growth, which are typically the 
criteria  governments  use  to  deﬁ ne  lagging 
areas.

In  developing  countries,  lagging  areas 
tend to be remote places where basic needs, 

such as access to sanitation and electricity, 
are not met. In developed countries, lagging 
areas  are  locations  with  poorer  job  pros-
pects than leading areas, but no differences 
in  basic  welfare.  So  distance  and  market 
access, in this Report, capture a wide range 
of  criteria  that  different  countries  use  to 
deﬁ ne a lagging area (see box 2.2).

It follows that distance-to-density is the 
cause of low income per capita, labor pro-
ductivity, and real wages—and of the high 
rates of poverty and unemployment. In the 
United Kingdom, economic density in the 
leading  London  and  southeast  areas  pro-
duces a wage premium of 18 percent, which 

BOX 2.2    How developed and developing countries deﬁ ne lagging areas: a quick survey

In this Report, a lagging area is defi ned 
as a place distant from density. How does 
this defi nition compare with how policy 
makers in developing and developed 
countries have, today and historically, 
defi ned lagging areas?

Usually, the criteria national govern-

ments use to classify an area as “lagging,” 
“disadvantaged,” or “backward” are linked 
to explicit strategies or policies for spatial 
or regional development. The criteria 
might be vague or precise. They might 
relate to a single indicator of economic per-
formance or to a weighted average of sev-
eral. And they might refl ect the defi nition 
of lagging areas at diff erent spatial scales. 
•  Vague. UK regional policy in the 1980s 
classifi ed a lagging area as being either 
a “development area” or an “intermedi-
ate area.” But the law was vague in the 
criteria it set to designate such areas. 
“In exercising his powers under the 
preceding provisions of this section [in 
the designation of development and 
intermediate areas] the Secretary of 
State shall have regard to all the circum-
stances actual and expected, including 
the state of employment and unemploy-
ment, population changes, migration 
and objectives of regional policies.”a 

•  Precise and simple. EU regional or “cohe-

sion” policy for the period 2007–13 
defi nes lagging areas as those qualify-
ing for assistance under the “conver-
gence objective,” equated with NUTS2 
areas with a GDP per capita of less 
than 75 percent of the EU average.b 
These areas are budgeted to receive 

around 71 percent of funds under the 
convergence objective. But, even in EU 
regional policy, funding is available on 
more favorable (and complicated) terms 
for those areas whose GDP per capita 
is not only less than 75 percent of the 
EU average, but which are in a country 
whose GDP per capita is less than 90 
percent of the EU average. These areas 
are considered to be “more lagging.”c

•  Precise and complicated. Between 1982 

and 1987 Canada’s Department of 
Regional Industrial Expansion used a 
development index to classify areas 
for allocations under its Industrial and 
Regional Development Program. The 
index assigned a 50 percent weight to 
an area’s unemployment, a 40 percent 
weight to its personal income, and a 10 
percent weight to the fi scal capacity of 
the province to identify 15 percent of 
the “least developed.”d

•  Sophisticatedly defi ned and measured. 

To identify areas considered as lag-
ging, Mexico’s microregional strategy 
uses a “marginalization index” based 
on indicators of access to such basic 
services as electricity and drinking 
water, and indicators of the quality of 
dwelling conditions and the proportion 
of the local working population that 
is poorly paid.e It is mainly targeted 
at remote rural communities in the 
south, because the “remoteness of 
rural communities often translates into 
conditions of poverty and a substantial 
lack of access to a wide range of basic 
public services.”f

Mexico is noteworthy not only because 
of the sophistication of the measure used 
to identify lagging areas, but also because 
of the sophisticated manner of defi ning 
areas. Rather than using crude administra-
tive boundaries to defi ne areas, geograph-
ical information system (GIS) techniques 
are used to consider an area’s geographi-
cal proximity, ethnic and cultural identity, 
and geoeconomic characteristics. 

So the criteria that diff erent countries 
use to identify lagging areas depend on 
the level of development and on domes-
tic political considerations. High levels of 
poverty and marginalization defi ne lag-
ging areas in developing countries, and a 
high rate of unemployment often defi nes 
them in developed countries. 

India’s 10th Five-Year Plan (2002–07) 

identifi es the northeastern region as 
“backward” and “disadvantaged” and 
thus deserving special policy attention. 
EU regional policy, under its convergence 
objective, makes special provisions for 
“the outermost regions,” deemed to 
require additional assistance.

This Report’s defi nition of lagging 

areas—as distant from density—captures 
this wide range of criteria.

distant areas in the north and southwest of 
England and in Scotland and Wales do not 
enjoy.25  In  Indonesia  the  potential  proﬁ t-
ability of ﬁ rms in textiles and other sectors 
is negatively related to distance-to-density: 
more distance, less proﬁ t. This is true for 
distance-to-density within the country and 
for  distance  to  an  international  port  and 
thus  to  the  density  in  international  mar-
kets.26 Again, lagging areas unable to attract 
investment and employment are those with 
a high distance-to-density.

As in today’s rich countries, distance-to-
density affects incomes in emerging mar-
ket countries. In China good market access 
produces  higher  individual  wages,  even 
after controlling for individual, sector-, and 
 province-speciﬁ c attributes, living cost dif-
ferences, and human capital externalities.27 
In Brazil lagging areas economically distant 
from  São  Paulo  and  other  large  markets 

have lower wages, and improving an area’s 
growth prospects largely depends on reduc-
ing distance.28 In Brazil’s leading area, eco-
nomic density implies a wage premium of 
13  percent, comparable to that in European 
countries.29,30 In Mexico the southern rural 
areas—distant from the economic density 
in Mexico City and the United States—have 
the lowest wages and highest poverty. 

Lagging  areas  in  many  countries  are 
home to ethnic minorities. Tribal, racial, 
and  religious  differences  in  access  to 
resources show up as spatial disparities. In 
a vicious cycle, disparities between areas 
that coincide with different ethnic groups 
can  deepen  political  divisions  and  fuel 
tensions,  contributing  to  greater  diver-
gence in living standards. They can even 
fuel civil conﬂ ict that is difﬁ cult to extin-
guish,  causing  “development  in  reverse” 
(see box 2.3).31

BOX 2.3    Dangerous disparities: when divisions aggravate distance

The academic literature argues that inter-
nal labor migration is the strongest force 
for convergence in economic and other 
measures of household welfare across 
areas of a country. But diff erences in lan-
guage, religion, ethnicity, and race are 
probably one of the strongest barriers to 
internal migration, a troubling dilemma for 
policy makers. The ethnic, linguistic, and 
religious barriers that may keep house-
holds from taking advantage of many 
opportunities to arbitrage geographic 
diff erences for employment and earnings 
can be the same barriers that cage poor 
people in lagging areas, perpetuate their 
poverty, and sharpen spatial disparities.
Disparities in East Asia. In Thailand 
17 percent of people in the northeast 
are poor, compared with 0.5 percent in 
Bangkok. About half of Thailand’s ethnic 
minority groups live in the Northeast. In 
Indonesia poverty and welfare indicators 
are persistently worse in West Kaliman-
tan—home to such ethnic minorities as 
the Dayak, Bugis, and Sambas—than in 
Java, home to Indonesia’s ethnic majority.

Disparities in South Asia. In India 

the states of Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, 
Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, 

Sikkim, and Tripura make up the lagging 
northeast. Except for the Assamese, 
the population is predominantly tribal, 
speaks Tibeto-Burman and Austro-Asiatic 
languages, and has a strong genetic simi-
larity with the people of East Asia. Hin-
duism is the dominant religion, but the 
proliferation of Christianity has set the 
area apart from the rest of India. By con-
ventional measures of economic welfare 
and development, northeastern states 
rank among the lowest in India.

Disparities in Africa. A study of 11 

Sub-Saharan countries found that ethnic-
ity was on its own a strong predictor of 
diff erences in child mortality, but when 
combined with geography, it continued 
to predict the probability of survival 
among children. For instance, in Côte 
d’Ivoire, mortality among two year olds 
fell much faster from 1970 to 1994 for the 
Baoule than for other ethnic groups. Chil-
dren of Ashanti women in Ghana were 
about 20 percent less likely to die than 
other children. In Uganda, Baganda chil-
dren under fi ve were a third less likely to 
die than children of other ethnic groups.

A 2005 study on spatial inequalities 

by the World Institute for Development 

Economics Research at the United Nations 
University in Helsinki (UNU-WIDER) conjec-
tured that “Spatial inequality is a dimen-
sion of inequality overall, but it has added 
signifi cance when spatial and regional 
divisions align with political and ethnic 
tensions to undermine social and political 
stability.”a These somewhat abstract words 
chillingly foreshadowed the violence in 
Kenya in early 2008, which left 1,500 peo-
ple dead and another 250,000 displaced. 
Violence began over the disputed outcome 
of a presidential election in late December 
2007, quickly exposing deep ethnic cleav-
ages that demarcate Kenya’s economic and 
political geography. Communal fi ghting 
was most pronounced around the town 
of El Doret in the Rift Valley, and on the 
outskirts of Kisumu in the Western district 
of the country. The Rift Valley and Western 
districts are among Kenya’s economically 
lagging areas and are the traditional home 
places of the minority Kalenjin, Luo, Kisi, 
and Luhya tribes, who along with other 
ethnic minorities in these areas harbor 
resentments related to economic depriva-
tion and neglect.

Lagging areas have higher poverty rates, 
leading areas have more poor people
The  rate  of  poverty  (the  poverty  head-
count) is related to distance, and the mass 
of  poverty  is  related  to  density.  Lagging 
areas tend to have a higher proportion of 
poor residents, and the leading areas tend 
to contain a higher share of the country’s 
poor people, because of the dense popu-
lation in leading areas. Vietnam’s lagging 
inland areas have the highest poverty rate, 
but  its  prosperous  leading  areas  contain 
the  mass  of  poor  people  (see  map  2.3). 
And  in  Honduras  the  country’s  poverty 
mass  is  concentrated  in  its  two  leading 
areas of Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula, 
while distant eastern areas generally have 
a high poverty rate (map 2.4).

Economic concentration in leading 
areas
As economies develop, economic activity gen-
erally becomes more concentrated, not less. 
In about a quarter of the world’s nations—
such as Botswana, Brazil, Norway, Russia, and 
Thailand—more than half of national income 
is generated on less than 5 percent of the land 
area. In half of all nations—such as Argen-
tina, Saudi Arabia, Slovenia, and Zambia—a 
third or more of national income is generated 
on less than 5 percent of land. Only one coun-
try in 10 has a dispersed economic mass, with 
less than a tenth of national income generated 
on 5 percent of its land. Among the few coun-
tries with this high spatial dispersion: Bangla-
desh, the Democratic Republic of Korea, the 
Netherlands, and Poland. 32

This section presents the historical expe-
rience of selected industrialized countries. 
Spanning more than a century, this section 
shows  how  these  countries  experienced 
rapidly  rising  spatial  concentrations,  fol-
lowed by a leveling off. It then turns to a 
large sample of developed and developing 
countries to document how the concentra-
tion of economic mass rises with a coun-
try’s development.

Rapidly rising concentration in the early 
stages of development, then a leveling
It is difﬁ cult to come by data that track the 
evolution  of  spatial  concentrations  of  eco-
nomic activity.33 The information available 
reveals  that  economic  development,  in  its 
early stages, is accompanied by a rapidly rising 
spatial concentration in a country. Not only 
does the volume of economic activity grow, 
but its generation becomes more compressed 
into a smaller land area. Leading areas beneﬁ t 
most from this compression and growth. 

Economic  concentration  in  the  Ile  de 
France—the  leading  area  of  France,  with 
about 2 percent of the country’s land—in-
creased rapidly from a value of around two 
times the hypothetical share in 1801 to three 
times in 1851 and to six times by 1910.34 It 
continued to rise, but less rapidly, to nine 
times that share in 1960. French GDP per 
capita grew from less than $1,000 in 1801 
to $7,000 in 1960. From 1960 on, however, 
its economic concentration stabilized, even 
though its GDP per capita tripled. In Can-
ada and the Netherlands the increases were 

not as dramatic, but both countries expe-
rienced the same pattern of rapidly rising 
concentrations at low levels of development, 
followed by a leveling off as GDP per capita 
rose past $10,000 (see ﬁ gure 2.2).35

Patterns are similar in today’s developing 
countries.  As  Thailand  industrialized  and 
grew rapidly, the concentration in the leading 
Bangkok metropolitan area increased from 
1.8 in 1975 to 3.1 in 2004, while GDP per cap-
ita increased fourfold. In Brazil too, the con-
centration in the leading São Paulo area edged 
upward from 7.3 in 1960 to 8.4 in 2004, as the 
country’s GDP per capita almost tripled.

For Japan during its post–World War II 
industrialization,  the  concentration  in  its 
leading area of greater Tokyo increased from a 
high of 7.1 in 1955 to about 8 in 1970 as its GDP 
per capita more than doubled. This increasing 
spatial concentration eventually levels off, as 
the spatial distribution of economic activity 
in a country stabilizes. After 1970, the con-
centration in greater Tokyo stabilized. 

In  the  United  States  as  GDP  per  capita 
rapidly  increased  from  $1,806  in  1850  to 
$4,091  in  1900,36  concentration  came  in 
the  manufacturing  belt  of  Green  Bay– St. 
 Louis–Baltimore–Portland  ME,  which 
accounted for three-quarters of U.S. manu-
facturing  employment.  Over  the  next  60 
years,  the  belt’s  share  of  manufacturing 
employment remained stable at two-thirds 
to  three- quarters.37  Despite  structural 
changes  in  the  U.S.  economy  and  shifting 
patterns  of  economic  concentration,  that 
concentration  remained  stable  after  1960.

Sources: WDR team estimates based on national accounts—statistical yearbooks of various years in respective countries. 1890 data for Canada come from Green (1969). Data 
on France are based on population numbers from Catin and Van Huffel (2003); Barro and Sala-I-Martin (2004). Data on Japan, the Netherlands, and Spain came from the Staff City 
Population Database, Human Settlements Group, International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED).

Another corroborative piece of evidence of 
rising concentration comes from the falling 
share of land area occupied by 80 percent of 
the U.S. population in the densest counties 
from  25  percent  of  the  U.S.  land  areas  in 
1900 to 17 percent in 2000.38

As countries grow beyond $10,000 GDP 
per capita, concentration tends to stabilize, 
with the details differing. The concentra-
tion in the leading area is greater in Canada, 
France, and Japan than it is in the Nether-
lands and the United States. For develop-
ing  countries  too,  Brazil,  Indonesia,  and 
the Philippines seem to be on paths toward 
greater  spatial  concentration  than  either 
Chile or Thailand.

International comparisons of 
concentration today support 
historical trends 
The relationship between a country’s devel-
opment and its spatial concentration holds 
for countries at different levels of develop-
ment. It holds for countries based on admin-
istrative areas (Canadian provinces, Japanese 
prefectures, Russian oblasts, and U.S. states), 
statistical areas (the nine census regions of 
the United States, the three regions in Ecua-
dor), and land areas (terrestrial grid cells of 
1° longitude by 1° latitude). And it holds for 
different measures of concentration.

Administrative  areas.  Different 
countries  have  different  numbers  of 

administrative areas, which may be of dif-
ferent geographic sizes. But controlling for 
these factors, a comparison of 24 develop-
ing countries—ranging from Mozambique 
with  a  GDP  per  capita  of  $211  to  Greece 
with more than $12,000—reveals the same 
pattern  as  the  historical  experiences  of 
Canada and France. The share of national 
GDP produced in the leading administra-
tive area tends to increase with the level of 
development (see ﬁ gure 2.3, panel a). 

Statistical areas. Statistical areas, broad 
census regions, can differ from administra-
tive areas. The United States has nine sta-
tistical areas but 50 states; Canada has ﬁ ve 
statistical areas but 10 provinces and three 
territories. A country’s statistical ofﬁ ce gen-
erally uses these areas to stratify its sam-
pling frame for household surveys, with the 
areas corresponding to the geographic par-
titions of a country such as east and west.39 
Despite the difference in aggregation, the 
data for statistical areas suggest the same 
relationship between concentration, mea-
sured  by  consumption  rather  than  GDP, 
and development (see ﬁ gure 2.3, panel b). 
Land  areas.  Terrestrial  grid  cells  of  1° 
longitude  by  1°  latitude,  each  correspond-
ing to a land area of 100 square kilometers 
can provide purer geographic resolution.40 
Spatial concentration within a country can 
then be measured as the share of national 
GDP generated on the densest 5 percent of

less than $10,000. But this relationship starts 
to level off when higher-income countries are 
included in the sample (ﬁ gure 2.3, panel c).

The  rising  concentration  of  production 
with economic development is not an artifact 
of  the  number  of  subnational  areas  across 
countries or of the different sizes of land area 
in the countries (see table 2.1). Consider Tan-
zania, Italy, France, and Sweden, with similar 
numbers of administrative areas (21 or 22). 
Tanzania’s  leading  area  of  Dar-es-Salaam 
generates 15 percent of national GDP, Italy’s 
leading area of Lombardia, 21 percent. France 
and Sweden, each with a higher GDP per cap-
ita than Italy, also have higher concentrations 
in their leading areas. 

For  a  set  of  countries  partitioned  into 
ﬁ ve statistical areas—ranging from Argen-
tina  to  Tajikistan—the  concentration  of 
consumption in the leading area increases 
with  development.  Among  medium-size 
countries with about 300,000 square kilo-
meters of land area, Ghana and Lao People’s 
Democratic  Republic  (both  low-income 
countries)  have  markedly  lower  spatial 
GDP  concentrations  measured  by  spatial 
Gini  coefﬁ cients42  than  Poland  (a  lower-

middle-income country) and New Zealand 
(a high-income country). Poland and New 
Zealand have lower spatial Gini coefﬁ cients 
than richer Norway and the United States. 
The pattern also holds for small and large 
countries. 

Divergence, then convergence—
between leading and lagging areas
When  production  is  primarily  agrarian, 
economic activity tends to be evenly distrib-
uted across space. Productivity differences 
are also moderate, varying naturally with 
soil quality and climate. But as an economy 
develops and production expands in manu-
facturing and services, some areas become 
more attractive to ﬁ rms and workers. Some 
are endowed with natural or “ﬁ rst nature” 
geographic  advantages.43  For  example,  a 
strategic coastal location makes an area a 
natural choice for a port (as with New York 
and Philadelphia in the United States). For 
others areas not so blessed by nature, their 
economic pull might be linked to a “second 
nature” historical accident. An example is 
Boston, saved from economic decline by an 
inﬂ ux of immigrant labor ﬂ eeing the Irish 
potato famine. For Irish immigrants it was 
cheaper to travel from Liverpool to Boston 
than to New York.

Economic  development  brings  with  it 
greater market integration, which facilitates 
the mobility of people and capital and allows 
for greater trade, forces beneﬁ ting the leading

areas. And by attracting people and ﬁ rms, 
leading areas fuel agglomeration economies, 
becoming centers for innovation and growth 
and driving the national economy. But the 
process does not go on forever. Agglomera-
tion economies start to be offset by conges-
tion  and  pollution,  the  diseconomies  of 
agglomeration. So the spatial concentration 
in leading areas starts to level off.

What, then, of the income and welfare 
disparities that accompany this pattern of 
ﬁ rst rising and then stable economic con-
centration? Is there a tendency for lagging 
areas to catch up with leading ones as eco-
nomic development progresses? What is the 
role of government policies in facilitating 
this convergence?

For today’s developed countries, spatial 
inequalities in income and welfare rose 
early, followed by slow convergence 
In today’s developed countries, per capita 
incomes  initially  diverged  between  sub-
national areas, and convergence began to set 
in as GDPs per capita approached $10,000, 
following  an  inverted-U  relationship  (see 
ﬁ gures 2.4 and 2.5 and table 2.2).44

Across areas of the United Kingdom, the 
coefﬁ cient  of  variation  of  GDP  per  capita 
increased by almost 40 percent between 1871 
and 1911.45 During this period, Britain went 
from a modern-day Namibia to a  Jordan or 
the former Yugoslavia.46 After World War II, 
GDP per capita across areas of the United 
Kingdom  displayed  a  slow  convergence, 
continuing until the late 1970s, when spatial 
inequalities stabilized.47

In the United States, the dispersion of per 
capita income across states increased between 
1840 and 1880, coinciding with the rise of the 
manufacturing belt in the North, and the Civil 
War and its aftermath. The end of the Civil 
War  marked  the  beginning  of  integration 
between states in the North and the South, 
and spatial dispersion in per capita income 
began to narrow. Because the southern states 
remained more dependent on agriculture, lag-
ging areas of the United States suffered a set-
back in the 1920s because of a sharp drop in 
the relative prices of agricultural goods. Once 
this  shock  dissipated,  the  slow  convergence 
between lagging and leading areas resumed 
with few interruptions until the 1990s, when 
disparities among states stabilized.48

Canada  and  France  also  exhibit  the 
same  inverted-U-shaped  pattern  of  ris-
ing  spatial  disparities  in  the  early  stages 
of  development—spanning  two  genera-
tions—followed by slow convergence (see 
ﬁ gure 2.5). In France the spatial dispersion 
of  wages  across  départements  increased 
between 1855 and 1900, when convergence 
set in. In Canada the spatial dispersion of 
average  gross  value  added  between  areas 
increased between 1890 and 1910, carrying 

over to 1929 and starting to fall by 1956.49 In 
Italy, Germany, and Spain, the convergence 
in per capita income gradually set in many 
years  after  these  economies  reached  high 
income—after World War II—followed by 
stable income disparities (see ﬁ gure 2.6).

Government policies can facilitate this 
convergence. In Japan, for example, invest-
ments  in  social  services  in  lagging  areas 
were  increased  as  concentration  of  eco-
nomic production accelerated. By making

BOX 2.4    Correcting geographic disparities in postwar Japan
In 1970, Prime Minister Eisaku Sato and 
the Cabinet initiated the New Economic 
and Social Development Plan and the 
New Integrated Spatial Development Plan 
(Shin-Zenso). The objective was to address 
disparities in living standards, as a result 
of accelerated growth in industrial areas 
around Tokyo, Nagoya, and Osaka along 
the Pacifi c Coast during the early postwar 
years. An excerpt in the Shin-Zenso sum-
marized the government’s vision:

instrumental in mobilizing fi nancial 
resources. The general account budget 
of the central government provided 
earmarked budget transfers to local gov-
ernments in addition to nonearmarked 
transfers. Among the earmarked budget 
transfers, a substantial amount was allo-
cated for investments in basic services 
(for example, rural roads) and social insti-
tutions under cost-sharing arrangements 
with the local government. 

The Fiscal Investment and Loan Pro-
gram pooled public funds from such 
sources as postal savings and public 
pension insurance premiums and then 
channeled them for investments in hous-
ing and social institutions to improve 

welfare in less developed areas. These 
policies were eff ective in corralling large 
investments toward achieving universal 
attainment of basic living standards. Per 
capita income converged between lead-
ing and other areas during the 1970s (see 
the fi gure on the right, below). Labor 
migration from rural to large urban areas 
was pronounced throughout the 1950s 
and 1960s, but it tapered off  after the 
mid-1970s.

Sources: Cabinet Council 1972; Hayashi 2003; 
Kamada, Okuno, and Futagami 1998; Minis-
try of Finance 2008; Nakajima 1982; Okuma 
1980; Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund 
1995; Policy Research Institute for Land 
2001; Sakamaki 2006.

Among many problems concerning spatial 
disparities, disparities in living standards are 
more serious than those in per capita income. 
From this standpoint, the construction of the 
basic services and social institutions must be 
accelerated in rural towns, and new policies 
must be adopted to improve the living condi-
tions of their surrounding areas above a certain 
minimum level.

These plans continued to provide pub-
lic investment in basic services and social 
institutions (for example, public utilities, 
medical facilities, and school buildings) 
to industrialized areas. But additional 
investments were made in the less devel-
oped areas, to achieve at least a minimal 
level of living standards for all places. The 
result was a rapid catch-up in investment 
in basic services and social institutions in 
less developed areas relative to the more 
industrialized areas (see the fi gure imme-
diately to the right).

Both the general account budget of 
the central government and the Fiscal 
Investment and Loan Program were 

the  labor  force  more  mobile,  this  led  to 
falling  geographic  disparities  in  incomes 
(box 2.4). 

For developing countries, spatial 
disparities in living standards between 
subnational areas ﬁ rst rise and then fall 
with development 
Comparing a large number of countries at 
different levels of development reveals that 
spatial  disparities  in  per  capita  product 
and welfare diminish with level of devel-
opment (see ﬁ gure 2.7). This is consistent 
with most developing countries being clus-
tered on the upward-sloping section of the 
inverted-U-shaped  relationship  between 
development  and  spatial  inequality—
and with the developed countries on the

second  source  is  based  on  the  geophysi-
cally  scaled  economic  data  of  terrestrial 
grid-cells of 1° longitude by 1° latitude for 
90 countries that span the full spectrum of 
development, from Ethiopia with a GDP 
per capita of less than $200, to Japan with 
a GDP of more than $30,000.50

The  household  survey  data  offer  an 
added advantage because individual house-
hold  consumption  is  a  better  measure  of 
welfare than income. Similar households in 
different areas of a developing country can 
have an average gap in household consump-
tion of 70 percent simply as a result of loca-
tion.51 In Nicaragua, a six-person household 
headed by a primary-educated 40-year-old 
male  in  the  lagging  area  of  Matagalpa-
 Jinotega consumes half of what an equiva-
lent  household  consumes  in  the  leading 
area of Managua. In Canada and the United 
States a household in the lowest GDP per 
capita area consumes 20 percent less than 
an equivalent household in the highest. In 
Japan the area of residence means even less 
for the gap in consumption. 

As  countries  become  more  developed, 
the disparities in welfare purely attributable 
to  location  diminish.52  This  pattern  holds 
after controlling for the land area of a coun-
try and its number of administrative areas. 
Among countries partitioned into ﬁ ve areas,

Bangladesh and Cambodia, both with GDP 
per capita less than $300,53 had spatial gaps 
in consumption between their leading and 
lagging areas of 89 percent and 73 percent, 
respectively.  For  Colombia  and  Thailand 
(with  GDPs  per  capita  of  approximately 
$2,000)  the  equivalent  gaps  are  about  50 
percent. For Canada (with a GDP per capita 
of $20,000) the gap is less than 25 percent. 
Among the medium-size countries, spatial 
disparities  in  welfare  follow  the  same  pat-
tern, falling across the spectrum from devel-
oping to industrialized countries. The same 
is true for larger and smaller countries (see 
table 2.3). 

Fast-growing countries see spatial 
disparities in income widen
East Asian growth has outstripped both the 
world  economy  and  the  growth  of  other 
developing  regions.  As  they  moved  from 
plan  to  market,  Eastern  European  and 
Central  Asian  countries  have  also  grown 
faster than the world (see ﬁ gure 2.8). As in 
the early stages of development in today’s 
industrialized  countries,  development  in 
East Asia, Central Asia, and Eastern Europe 
has  brought  widening  gaps.  In  Southeast 
Asia  the  disparities  in  incomes  per  capita 
between  leading  and  lagging  areas  has 
grown wider (see ﬁ gure 2.9). In China too, 
the  spatial  dispersion  in  GDP  per  capita 
increased  over  the  last  decade  (see  ﬁ gure 
2.10). All this is consistent with the ﬁ ndings 
of the UNU-WIDER research program.

In  Eastern  Europe  and  Central  Asia, 
too,  disparities  among  subnational  areas 
in  labor  productivity  and  income  wid-
ened.  In  Russia  income  per  capita  in  the 
lagging subnational area in 1985 was half 
the national average, and that in the lead-
ing area, twice the national average. Since 
then, income per capita in the lagging area 
has fallen to a quarter of the national aver-
age, while that in the leading area increased 
to  ﬁ ve  times  the  national  average.54  This 
divergence  occurred  during  a  reshaping 
of  Russia’s  economic  geography  as  state 
industries  in  remote  areas  collapsed,  and 
economic  activity started to respond to spa-
tial variations in market potential (see box 
2.5). Similarly, the Czech Republic, Hun-
gary, Poland, and the Slovak Republic have

and energy (see the table below). 

The eff ort to develop Russia’s eastern 
areas was substantially increased under 
Stalin’s rule. A forced industrialization 
attempted to shift production to the east 
and create new economic bases in the 
country’s geographic heart. Equalization 
of economic (especially industrial) mass 
across Russia was seen as the way to 
make development uniform across space. 
“Balanced industrial growth” remained 
a slogan for a long time. In the 1930s the 
new areas received more than 50 per-
cent of the central investment, fi nanced 
mainly by expropriating wealth from 
agriculture. The new areas absorbed only 
capital at fi rst. Visible eff ects appeared 
during World War II, although the most 
productive zones were close to the front, 
like the Ural-Volga, where 58 percent of 
factories evacuated from the west of the 
USSR were placed. 

An accounting of this centralized, direc-

tive eff ort to spread out economic mass 
is depressing. Alexei Mints, the Soviet 
geographer, dismissed as propaganda the 
claims that directed investment boosted 
backward areas and created cities “from 
zero” under the fi ve-year plans. The real-
ity was more prosaic: the “opening up” of 
eastern raw material fi elds coincided with 
the growth of manufacturing in the west. 
The shift eastward, Mints wrote, occurred 
mostly in the European part.a In reality, 
Russia’s demographic and economic 
geocenter had moved only as far east 
as the river Belaya in Bashkiria by 1990; 
eight of Russia’s 11 time zones lay to the 

The Soviet social infrastructure over-

lapped with industrial development. 
Health centers, schools, recreational, 
cultural, sports, and communal-housing 
facilities—called sotscultbyt—generally 
belonged to enterprises. This overlap 
was especially evident in large com-
panies in remote areas, such as the 
transpolar city of Noril’sk. This tradition 
was combined, somewhat paradoxi-
cally, with a vigorous redistribution of 
funds between sectoral and regional 
departments. Profi ts were seized and 
then given back—not necessarily to the 
same place—in capital goods and assets. 
The share of enterprises under the all-
Union jurisdiction reached 70 percent 
in the reigns of Stalin and Brezhnev. The 
central government (Sovmin) controlled 
less than 20 percent of industrial profi ts 
obtained on Russian soil. 

Industrial deconcentration, together 

with price system distortions and an 
expensive arms race, would bring the 
Soviet system down. In the late 1980s 
both the elite and the masses in almost 
every area or republic claimed that it bore 
the burdensome duty of a land that “fed 
the others.” The slogan of regional khoz-
raschet (self-repayment and economic 
accounting) soon grew into political sepa-
ratism and contributed to the demise of 
the Soviet Union. 

After the Soviet Union collapsed, the 
Russian Federation became more inte-
grated with the world market. Russia 

found itself more resource abundant, 
but also less populated. The market 
revaluation of resources and assets 
shrank the economic mass of distant 
zones and poles, but deteriorating infra-
structure did not reduce, and in some 
cases, increased economic distance. 
Industry-tied public services also col-
lapsed in the 1990s, as fi rms were priva-
tized or transferred to their sotscultbyt 
to municipal authorities. For some time 
under Yeltsin, the revenues of federal 
and regional/local budgets were offi  -
cially equal (50:50). In the 2000s, though, 
the rules were changed in favor of the 
Federation (60:40 when the external 
debt payments were made, reduced 
later to 55:45). But expenditures stayed 
at 50:50 because of growing transfers. 

Today, center-region fi nancial rela-

tions are again based on the principle of 
redistribution, though less so than in the 
Soviet Union. But industry is now more 
fuel and material based. After decades 
of equalization plans, the economy sees 
widening disparities in regional per capita 
product. 

The fi gures on the next page show this 

for 1990 and 2005, using old Soviet net 
material and new gross regional product 
(GRP) methods and prices. The two lead-
ers, Tyumen oblast in Western Siberia 
and Moscow in the center, remained the 
same. But the gap between leading and 
lagging areas skyrocketed from 5 to 43. 
With redistribution, the leading-lagging 
gap in each area’s average personal 
income in 2005 was 11. Only 20 of 88 
regions exceed the Russian average in per 
capita GRP, and only 22 in income. Most 
poor areas reduced the gap in living stan-
dards with the help of transfers.

Welfare in remote areas has become 

less dependent on economic mass in con-
temporary Russia. The trend is not seen 
as satisfactory by some Russian observ-
ers and policy makers, but what should 
be done about it is not clear. The policy 
debate ranges between two polar visions: 
reinforcing the redistributive system 

across space based on a wider sharing of 
oil and gas profi ts, or a forced diversifi ca-
tion of regional economies based on mili-
tary-industrial activities and research and 
development initiatives. While the debate 
continues, Russia’s experience under the 
Soviet government off ers policy lessons. 
Particularly for a country with the world’s 

largest land area, spatial policy choices 
and their effi  ciency could mean the dif-
ference between economic progress and 
stagnation.

The  East  Asian  and  Eastern  European 
countries  appear  to  be  on  the  rising  part 
of the inverted-U curve. Economic activity 
is still concentrating in a small number of 
favored leading areas, with agglomeration 
economies  increasing  their  productivity, 
wages, and income per capita. The lagging 
areas,  insufficiently  integrated  into  the 
national  economy,  have  not  yet  captured 
spillovers from the leading areas.

The dynamics of geographic divergence 
in East Asia, Eastern Europe, and Central 
Asia have generally been a “race to the top.” 
All  subnational  areas  experienced  gains 
in  average  wages  and  household  incomes, 
though the biggest gains have gone to the

leading  areas.55  Among  the  poorest  prov-
inces  in  China,  the  southwest  region  had 
GDP per capita growth of 7.7 percent over 
1979–98, the central region 7.8 percent, and 
the  northwest  region  8.4  percent.56  East 
Asian countries saw phenomenal declines in 
poverty from more than 450 million poor 
living on less than $1 a day in 1990 to about 
120 million in 2007.57 For Eastern Europe 
and  Central  Asia,  the  divergence  between 
1998 and 2003 was associated with a fall of 
40 million in the region’s poor living on less 
than $2 a day, mainly because the mass of 
poverty is in leading areas.58

Some relatively closed or middle-
income countries had incomes converge
In  upper-middle-income  Brazil,  the  dis-
persion of state per capita income around 
the national mean fell from a coefﬁ cient of 
variation of 0.65 in 1970 to 0.49 in 1995.59 
Chile  witnessed  spatial  convergence  in 
GDP  per  capita  across  subnational  areas 
between 1960 and 2001, when its GDP per 
capita more than doubled from $4,270 to 
$10,538.60  Upper-middle-income  South 
Africa  also  had  per  capita  incomes  con-
verge  between  its  towns  and  cities  from 
1990 to 2000.61 For Colombia, a relatively 
closed economy, the ratio of GDP per cap-
ita in the leading departamento of Santafé 
de Bogotá to the lagging departamento of 
Choco  fell  from  10  to  6  during  1950–60 
and to 3.1 in 1990.62 

As incomes diverge, health and 
education converge 
Many developing countries have had subna-
tional Millennium Development Indicators 
across areas converge, so even though dis-
parities in income and material well-being 
widened,  basic  welfare  has  become  more 
equal. In Indonesia the coefﬁ cient of varia-
tion  across  provinces  for  average  years  of 
schooling fell from 0.43 in 1971 to 0.15 in 
2000, and that for the poverty rate fell from 
0.42 to 0.35.63 In Thailand infant mortality 
rates narrowed from a minimum-maximum 
gap of 6 percentage points between the lead-
ing and lagging areas in 1980 to 0.7 percent-
age  points  in  2000,64  around  a  national 
mean  of  six  deaths  per  1,000  live  births. 
In  Vietnam  the  gap  in  malnutrition  rates 
between leading and lagging areas fell from 
20 percentage points in 1998 to 15 percent-
age points in 2004, accompanying an overall 
improvement for all areas.65 In China terri-
torial disparities in the human development 
index declined between 1995 and 2003. The 
disparity  between  the  best-performing 
province (Beijing) and the worst-perform-
ing province (Tibet) declined from 0.26 in 
1995 to 0.19 in 2003 for life expectancy, and 
from 0.50 to 0.32 for the human develop-
ment index. The gap for literacy rates also 
declined between 1990 and 2003, from 58 to 
51 percentage points.66 The convergence of 
basic welfare in rapidly growing East Asian 
countries is epitomized by Malaysia (see ﬁ g-
ure 2.12).

For Mexican states, rates of adult literacy 
and infant mortality converged from 1940 
to 2002, as did life expectancy and enroll-
ment rates from 1990 to 2002.67 In Egypt 
the  gap  in  female  primary  school  enroll-
ment  rates  between  the  best-  and  worst-
performing  governorates  narrowed  from 
41 percentage points in 1995 to 25 in 2004, 
as did the literacy rate and the gender gap in 
literacy between 1986 and 2001.68 

Not all countries have experienced spa-
tial convergence in the Millennium Devel-
opment Indicators. Countries in South Asia 
and Africa still have wide internal dispari-
ties.  In  India  and  Sri  Lanka  the  dispari-
ties  across  states  remained  large  between 
1981 and 1991,69,70 though there have been 
absolute  improvements  both  nationwide 
and  in  the  country’s  lagging  areas.  In  Sri 
Lanka poverty was reduced in all provinces 
between  1991  and  2007,  with  the  fastest 
reduction in its leading western province.71 
In  Kenya  provincial  gaps  in  primary 
and  secondary  school  enrollment  rates 
remained large between 1999 and 2004, but 
more important, all areas made progress, 
including the lagging Northeast.72 

What’s different for today’s 
developers?
In  The  Wealth  of  Nations,  published  in 
1776,  Adam  Smith  wrote,  “It  is  upon  the 
sea coast, and along the banks of navigable 
rivers, that industry of every kind naturally 
begins to sub-divide and improve itself, and 
it is frequently not till a long time after that 
those improvements extend themselves to 
the  inland  parts  of  the  country.”73  What 
Smith wrote in 1776 could apply equally to 
the spatial processes in China’s modern eco-
nomic development. What, if anything, is 
different for today’s developing countries?

In  some  fundamental  respects,  very 
little.  Smith’s  key  point  was  that  a  coun-
try’s  economic  development,  in  its  early 
stages, tends to be led by subnational areas 
that  provide  the  greatest  potential  access 
to  markets  and  thus  to  density.  But  sub-
national areas distant from density, inland 
areas  in  Smith’s  example,  tend  to  be  left 
behind. Only later in the development pro-
cess do these lagging areas share more of 

the beneﬁ ts of development as a slow sub-
national  convergence  in  living  standards 
sets in. This basic thesis holds true today. 

But there are some important differences 

for modern-day developing countries:

(cid:129)  Given  the  phenomenal  size  of  today’s 
global market, development relies more 
on pursuing an outward-oriented strat-
egy in which leading areas compete and 
trade globally.

(cid:129)  The  rapid  transformation  of  internal 
economic  geography—and  the  spatial 
disparities in today’s developing coun-
tries—will  likely  be  greater  than  in 
industrial  countries  during  their  early 
stages of development.

(cid:129)  Because redistributive mechanisms take 
time to build and mature, labor mobility 
and market connectivity are more potent 
mechanisms  to  integrate  lagging  areas 
into national economies. Globalization 
and technological progress in transpor-
tation  and  communication  potentially 
provide a wider range of means to bridge 
the economic distance between leading 
and lagging areas.

Global  markets  are  more  important. 
Because of greater integration today, global 
markets  are  more  important  than  domes-
tic markets than at any time in history. The 
market potential of leading areas is higher in 
today’s developing countries than it was in 
today’s developed countries during the nine-
teenth and early twentieth centuries, thanks 
to the rapid growth of trade since the end of

World War II. Indeed, the growth of trade 
has been about twice that of world income 
in  recent  decades.74  Trade  as  a  proportion 
of  world  GDP  is  now  more  than  25  times 
its level in 1820 (see ﬁ gure 2.13). So devel-
opment under protectionist policies might 
have been a viable (if not optimal) strategy 
in the nineteenth and early twentieth cen-
turies.75 But a protectionist strategy is much 
less  likely  to  be  viable  today,  especially  in 
the light of recent failures of such policies in 
Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa. 

When  a  country  is  relatively  closed,  an 
area’s market potential is determined mainly 
by its distance to density within the country. 
But once it is open, distance or access to inter-
national  markets  also  becomes  important, 
and  border  and  coastal  areas  tend  to  gain 
in their shares of economic activity. Struc-
tural shifts in patterns of trade can alter the 
topography of market potential in a country: 
previously leading areas, perhaps favored by 
policy, lose out and decline as their distance 
to new leading areas increases. This is illus-
trated by Britain, China, and Mexico. 

Openness  matters  for  distance.  Before 
Mexico  liberalized  trade  in  1985,  the  dis-
tance to Mexico City was the primary deter-
minant  of  an  area’s  market  potential.  But 
with  liberalization,  distance  to  density  in 

the  United  States  also  became  important, 
and  border  areas  such  as  Ciudad  Juarez, 
Mexicali- Calexico,  Nogales,  and  Tijuana 
had large increases in market potential and 
growth,  whereas  Mexico  City  had  some 
depopulation  and  dispersion  of  its  manu-
facturing activity.76

In  China,  during  Mao’s  era  of  self-
 sufﬁ ciency, heavy industries were promoted 
in  interior  provinces,  which  received  71 
percent of state investment between 1966 
and  1970.  Many  companies  in  Shanghai 
and  other  coastal  cities  were  relocated  to 
the interior and mountainous provinces of 
Guizhou, Hubei, and Sichuan.77 But since 
China  has  become  more  open  to  foreign 
trade and investment, coastal areas ﬂ our-
ished as gateways to overseas markets, but 
many  interior  areas  ﬂ oundered.  Export-
oriented  industries  (garments,  electron-
ics,  leather)  are  concentrated  in  coastal 
provinces, while domestic market-oriented 
industries  (metals,  nonferrous  smelting) 
are dispersed (see map 2.5).78 

The costs of transport and telecommu-
nications matter more. Sea coasts and navi-
gable rivers are natural locations for leading 
areas because, in Smith’s day, shipping was 
the  most  cost-effective  way  of  transport-
ing  goods  to  domestic  and  international

markets. But technological progress has led 
to large reductions in the cost of transport-
ing goods and in telecommunications (see 
chapter 6). New (non-water-based) modes 
of transport and the information technol-
ogy revolution have reshaped the landscape 
of economic density.

Access to knowledge is easier. So today’s 
developing countries can take advantage of 
world markets  of unprecedented size and 
can access these markets with greater ease. 
At the same time, greater ﬂ ows of foreign 
direct investment, expanding twice as fast 
as world trade, increase access to knowledge 
at the world’s technological frontier.79 For 
the  most  successful  developing  countries 
(mainly in East Asia) of recent decades, the 
result  has  been  national  growth—driven 
by  leading  areas—far  faster  than  that  of 
today’s  developed  countries  in  the  early 
stages of their development.

With  such  rapid  growth  in  leading 
areas, the geographic disparities in today’s 
developing  countries  are  far  larger.  Take 
China, for example, whose GDP per capita 
is roughly equivalent to that of Britain in 
1911. London then had a GDP per capita 
around  1.7  times  the  national  average, 
whereas East Anglia had a GDP per capita 
two-thirds that average.80 In China today, 
the comparable ﬁ gures are 3.3 for the lead-
ing area of Shanghai and one-third for the 
lagging area of Guizhou.81 Shanghai has a 
GDP per capita ($16,044), roughly equiva-
lent to the British average in 1988, while 

Guizhou has a level ($1,653) close to the 
British average in 1830.82

Although comparisons between China 
and Britain need to be made with caution 
because of the different geographic scales of 
the two countries, the basic point remains. 
When today’s rich countries were develop-
ing during the nineteenth and early twen-
tieth centuries, the growth of their leading 
areas was constrained to the rate of growth 
of  their  domestic  markets  and  the  world 
technological  frontier.  These  constraints 
limited the extent to which spatial dispari-
ties could increase in their early stages of 
development. In sharp contrast, for today’s 
developing countries, these constraints no 
longer exist. Although the absence of these 
constraints helps developing countries, the 
potential disparities that can arise between 
leading and lagging areas in the early stages 
of development are much larger.

Although the spatial inequality between 
leading and lagging areas in today’s devel-
oping  countries  will  follow  the  same 
 inverted-U  shaped  path,  the  features  of 
this path will differ. The ascent is likely to 
be steeper in the initial stages of develop-
ment. Set against this faster rise in dispari-
ties, however, is the opportunity for faster 
convergence between lagging and leading 
areas as development progresses—because 
modern information and communications 
technologies offer a wider range of methods 
to  bridge  the  economic  distance  between 
leading and lagging areas.

CHAPTER 3

Division

Density and distance, the dimensions 

of economic geography examined 
in the two previous chapters, mat-
ter  for  the  development  of  countries  and 
regions. Over the past two centuries, global 
gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  has  grown 
about 2.3 percent a year, an almost 50-fold 
increase in constant dollars.1 But growth has 
not been uniform. Half of global GDP today 
is produced on just 1.5 percent of the world’s 
land, which would ﬁ t comfortably into Alge-
ria.  This  dense  economic  mass  is  home  to 
about a sixth of the world’s people.2 

High density reﬂ ects the self-reinforcing 
beneﬁ ts  of  proximity  between  economic 
agents across spatial scales—local, regional, 
and international. Distance also matters for 
countries and world regions. For the past 
50 years, by far the largest share of global 
economic  activity  has  been  concentrated 
in  North  America,  Western  Europe,  and 
Northeast  Asia  (see  map  3.1).  Being  near 
these largest markets for products and sup-
plies opens great opportunities. Indeed, the 
correlation between access to markets and 
economic growth is strong.

But  it  is  the  persistence  of  divisions 
between nation-states that sets the processes 
of economic geography apart for countries 
and regions. The latest wave of globaliza-
tion, which began after World War II, has 
been associated with a borderless world. In 
1990 Kenichi Ohmae famously pronounced 
that “borders have effectively disappeared.”3
For some world regions and some transac-
tions across borders, this reﬂ ects reality. But 
borders, rather than disappear, have tripled 
in the past 50 years. There are now about 

600 land borders between nations (see ﬁ g-
ure 3.1).4 And their number may continue 
to  increase  if  federated  states  split  apart, 
if  minorities  within  nations  achieve  self-
 determination, and if some of the remain-
ing 70 dependencies seek independence.5 

This chapter shows how divisions affect 
economic  development,  how  geography 
and  cultural  history  contribute  to  persis-
tent divisions, and how countries impose 
barriers  to  productive  interaction  with 
their neighbors and the rest of the world. 
Economies beneﬁ t from gradually lowering 
barriers, and rich countries tend to have the 
lowest barriers to trade and factor mobil-
ity. Countries that have integrated region-
ally beneﬁ t from growth spillovers, larger 
home markets, and scale economies in pro-
duction and some types of public services. 
Some  countries  within  a  region  may  ini-
tially prosper more than others, but living 
standards  eventually  converge  in  regions 
that have integrated. And in a world with 
economic  activity  and  purchasing  power 
concentrated in a few regions, countries that 
have integrated globally beneﬁ t from access 
to those markets and sources of investment. 
This chapter makes the case for countries to 
promote such integration. 

The main ﬁ ndings:

(cid:129)  Divisions  between  countries  make  for 
thicker borders in the developing world.
Borders restrict the ﬂ ow of goods, capi-
tal,  people,  and  ideas  everywhere.  But 
larger  countries  with  big  markets  may 
get  by  with  more  restrictive  borders. 
Small  countries  have  to  worry  more.

Division 

97

Some types of divisions, like being land-
locked, are beyond the control of individ-
ual  countries.  Others  are  self-imposed. 
And as countries develop, they gradually 
lower almost all types of barriers.

(cid:129)  Economic mass is concentrated in North 
America, Western Europe, and North-
east Asia. And only East Asia has signiﬁ -
cantly increased its share of global GDP 
in recent decades. This global concen-
tration matters greatly for the develop-
ment prospects of today’s lagging world 
regions,  and  increasing  their  access  to 
these large world markets must be a pri-
ority for global development policy.

(cid:129)  Within world regions, economic devel-
opment tends to be accompanied by an 
initial  divergence  in  living  standards 
between countries, followed by conver-
gence. Basic health and education indi-
cators show improvements in almost all 
world  regions,  but  there  is  some  diver-
gence in incomes between the richest and 
poorest countries. The increasing inequal-
ity  between  countries  within  a  region 
reverses as lagging countries beneﬁ t from 
growth spillovers from leading countries. 
(cid:129)  Overcoming  divisions  between  coun-
tries regionally and globally is essential 
for  sustained  progress.  This  points  to 
the importance of facilitating access to 
global markets and promoting regional 
integration  in  all  its  many  forms  (see 
chapters 6 and 9).

Defining division
Borders  and  divisions  are  not  synonyms. 
National borders enclose people with shared 
characteristics,  providing  a  sense  of  place 
and belonging that contributes to social wel-
fare.  They  also  generate  manageable  units 
for governing society. And well deﬁ ned and 
settled, they provide security and stability, 
yielding  considerable  economic  benefits. 
Divisions, by contrast, arise when borders 
are poorly managed. They range from mod-
erate restrictions on the ﬂ ow of goods, capi-
tal, people, and ideas to more severe divisions 
triggered by territorial disputes, civil wars, 
and conﬂ icts between countries. Borders are 
not a problem in themselves. But the conse-
quences for economic development are quite 
different  when  the  countries  separated  by

those borders are integrated in a functional 
economic community (the Czech Republic 
and the Slovak Republic) or divided by con-
ﬂ ict, reducing the scope for further integra-
tion (Eritrea and Ethiopia).

Viewed through an economic lens, some 
borders  are  much  wider  than  others  (see 
map  3.2).  The  width  or  thickness  of  each 
country’s borders is proportional to restric-
tions that each country imposes on the ﬂ ow 
of goods, capital, people, and ideas with all 
other countries.6 The wider the border, the 
more the country limits trade, travel, and the 
ﬂ ow of factors of production. 
(cid:129)  Economic borders are narrow in North 
America, Western Europe, Japan, Austra-
lia, and New Zealand; are wide in Asia, 
Africa,  and  Eastern  Europe;  and  are  in 
between  in  Latin  America.  Countries 
with  wide  borders  include  emerging 
economies in East Asia and countries in 
 Sub-Saharan  Africa,  which  for  decades 
have had low growth.

Note: The width of borders is proportional to a summary measure of each country’s restrictions to the flow of goods, capital, people, and ideas with all other countries. Gray 
areas = insufficient data.

(cid:129)  Borders of the same width appear nar-
rower  around  larger  countries.  This 
reﬂ ects  the  reality  that  large  countries 
can often get away with more restrictive 
policies.  Small  countries  depend  more 
on openness to overcome small markets 
and production scales.

(cid:129)  Some countries with narrow borders are 
surrounded  by  countries  with  restric-
tive policies, making it more difﬁ cult for 
them to beneﬁ t from openness than for 
countries in more open neighborhoods.
(cid:129)  This is true more for countries that are 
open but landlocked, such as Armenia, 
Uganda,  and  Zambia,  than  for  those 
that are open and coastal, such as Chile 
or Georgia. Some coastal countries, by 
contrast, have such high restrictions that 
they might as well be landlocked.

Comparing  border  widths  with  eco-
nomic status conﬁ rms that wealthier coun-
tries typically have lower border restrictions 
(see  ﬁ gure  3.2).7  As  a  country  develops,  it 
strengthens the institutions that manage its 
borders and regulate the ﬂ ow of goods and 
factors of production. It also becomes more 
integrated  into  the  global  economy  and 

opens its borders to beneﬁ t from interactions 
with  other  countries,  promoting  further 
development. But there are exceptions. Some 
upper-middle-income  countries  maintain 
high restrictions—all of them oil exporters: 
Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Libya, and Saudi 
Arabia (upper right of ﬁ gure 3.2). And some 
poorer countries have greatly reduced bor-
der restrictions, among them the landlocked 
countries of Armenia, Uganda, and Zambia, 
as well as the coastal countries of The Gam-
bia, Georgia, Haiti, Kenya, Madagascar, and 
Nicaragua (lower left). 

How countries maintain divisions
Countries  choose  how  permeable  their 
borders  are,  affecting  the  ﬂ ows  of  goods, 
capital, people, and ideas. And the effects of 
division change as countries become more 
open to some ﬂ ows and restrict others.

Goods and services. Borders reduce trade. 
A study in the mid-1990s found that trade 
between  Canadian  provinces  is,  on  aver-
age, more than 20 times greater than trade 
between those provinces and equally distant 
places in the United States. That implies a 
“border-width” equivalent to increasing the 
trade distance by 10,500 miles.8 More recent

estimates suggest that international borders 
reduce trade between industrial countries by 
a still signiﬁ cant 20–50 percent.9 The reduc-
tions are even larger for developing countries, 
which tend to have higher trade barriers. 

Countries that encourage exports and are 
open to imports of goods and services grow 
faster and reduce poverty more than coun-
tries that do not encourage exports. When 
exports are concentrated in labor-intensive 
manufacturing, trade increases the wages for 
unskilled  workers,  beneﬁ ting  poor  people. 
It also encourages macroeconomic stability, 
again beneﬁ ting the poor, who are more likely 
to be hurt by inﬂ ation. And through innova-
tion  and  factor  accumulation,  it  enhances 
productivity and thus growth.10 There may 
be  some  empirical  uncertainty  about  the 
strength of trade’s relationship with growth.11 
But essentially all rich and emerging econo-
mies have a strong trade orientation.

A  country’s  openness  to  trade  is  often 
measured  by  a  country’s  sum  of  exports 
and imports as a share of GDP. But a more 
direct  measure  is  the  average  tariff  rate, 
which  fell  globally  from  close  to  30  per-
cent in the early 1980s to about 10 percent 
in  2005.12  Tariffs  are  highest  in  Africa, 
South Asia, and Western Asia and lowest in 
member countries of the Organisation for 
Economic Co-operation and Development 

(OECD) (see ﬁ gure 3.3). Quotas, subsidies, 
antidumping duties, licensing, and idiosyn-
cratic or confusing regulations affect trade 
as well.13 Using tariff and nontariff barriers, 
poor countries restrict trade more than rich 
countries. They also face higher barriers to 
their exports. Nontariff barriers, on aver-
age, represent more than two-thirds of total 
trade barriers, with higher proportions in 
rich countries than in poor.

Capital. Restrictions on capital ﬂ ows in 
200514 are lower in industrial than in devel-
oping countries (see ﬁ gure 3.4) and are great-
est in Africa, Central Asia, and South Asia. 
Recent empirical work—much prompted by 
the ﬁ nancial crises of the 1990s—provides 
qualiﬁ ed evidence that ﬁ nancial globaliza-
tion beneﬁ ts developing countries and that 
greater ﬁ nancial openness does not by itself 
contribute to more severe economic crises.15 
By reducing the cost of capital in receiving 
countries, freeing capital account transac-
tions increases the availability of resources 
for productive investment. It can also pro-
mote portfolio diversiﬁ cation, thus mitigat-
ing  risk,  and  encourage  sound  monetary 
management.  From  1955  to  2004,  freeing 
capital accounts had a positive association 
with growth in both developed and emerg-
ing economies.16 Liberalizing equity markets

added  1  percentage  point  to  annual  GDP 
growth.17 But short-term debt ﬂ ows, which 
include  portfolio  bond  flows  and  com-
mercial bank loans, can be highly volatile. 
In  countries  where  the  ﬁ nancial  sector  is 
underdeveloped, governments and ﬁ nancial 
institutions may increase their exposure to 
short-term debt and thus their vulnerability 
to sudden outﬂ ows.

The indirect beneﬁ ts of global integration 
and free capital ﬂ ows may be greater than 
the  direct  effect  of  capital  accumulation 
and portfolio diversiﬁ cation. Open markets 
can  enforce  monetary  discipline,  macro-
economic  stability,  and  ﬁ nancial  develop-
ment. They can also strengthen institutions 
and  governance  structures.  And  they  can 
increase integration with the global econo-
my.18  Where  markets  and  governance  are 
well developed, ﬁ nancial globalization con-
tributes  to  GDP  and  productivity  growth 
and reduces ﬁ nancial vulnerability. Where 
they  are  not,  the  impacts  on  growth  are 
ambiguous, and the risk of a ﬁ nancial crisis 
is high. 

People. Migration ﬂ ows have increased 
with globalization, but much less than trade 
or capital ﬂ ows. Global estimates suggest that 
11 million people move annually for longer-
term  employment  or  to  settle  in  another 
country. About 3.5 million of them are low-
skilled workers, many migrating to the Gulf 

States or other middle-income countries.19 
Migrants  move  for  higher  wages,  greater 
education opportunities, or a better quality 
life (see chapter 5). Sending countries receive 
remittances, shed surplus agricultural labor, 
and beneﬁ t from return migration by those 
who have acquired skills or capital abroad. 
Receiving countries, many with aging popu-
lations or chronic labor shortages, increase 
their  labor  pool  by  admitting  unskilled 
workers and their productivity by attracting 
highly qualiﬁ ed migrants.

The  economic  benefits  from  more 
migration  could  be  great.20  The  pool  of 
potential  migrants  is  likely  to  remain 
large  given  prevailing  wage  differentials 
between poor and rich countries, three to 
four times those triggering the mass migra-
tion of Europeans to North America in the 
late-nineteenth century.21 Yet, despite the 
potential beneﬁ ts and the ready supply of 
migrants, most countries restrict in-migra-
tion, largely because of perceived negative 
effects on domestic labor markets.

Comparable information on migration 
restrictions is not available. But countries 
also  regulate  admission  of  short-term 
visitors.  Each country faces a tradeoff in 
allowing people from some nations to visit 
for  business  or  pleasure,  while  deterring 
residents  of  other  nations  for  economic, 
political,  or  security  reasons.  This  pro-
duces a complex system of “unequal access 
to  foreign  spaces”22  that  reﬂ ects  similar 
restrictions for people seeking to migrate. 
Residents of richer countries face fewer visa 
requirements than those from poorer coun-
tries (see ﬁ gure 3.5). But poorer countries 
also  restrict  entry  by  visitors  from  other 
nations. Exit can be regulated as well. Many 
countries make it difﬁ cult for their citizens 
to leave.23 Passport costs across countries 
are as high as 125 percent of per capita gross 
national  income  (GNI),  and  higher  costs 
are associated with lower migration rates.

Ideas.  Basic  labor-intensive  manufac-
turing  is  a  stepping  stone  for  countries  to 
improve  their  economic  fortunes.  But  to 
maintain  growth  that  outpaces  population 
and  reduces  poverty,  an  economy  needs  to 
move from low-margin activities to the devel-
opment and production of new or improved 
products, a process associated with moving 
from low- income to middle-income status.

Endogenous growth theory stresses that new 
ideas support this transition, generating eco-
nomic rents that enable the accumulation of 
private and public capital. China—for the past 
two decades a producer of low-margin, stan-
dardized manufactured goods—now exports 
more than $300 billion worth of information 
and communication technology (ICT) goods 
a year. So far, most of these exports have been 
assembled from imported components, with 
the  largest  rents  captured  by  foreign  ﬁ rms 
that  develop  innovative  technologies  and 
control  marketing  and  sales.  Of  the  retail 
proceeds from an iPod® music player assem-
bled in China, more than half goes to Apple’s 
proﬁ ts and the retail and distribution costs.24 
Assembly and testing account for only about 
2 percent of the ﬁ nal sale value. 

Freedom of access to all types of infor-
mation is necessary for an atmosphere that 
induces innovation and productivity. Ideas 
and knowledge spread through the research 
and  development  (R&D)  investments  by 
ﬁ rms  and  governments  and  through  the 
global  stock  of  existing  knowledge  acces-
sible through publications, patents, and so 
on.25 Governments do not restrict the ﬂ ow 
of purely technical information, although 
poorer  countries  have  limited  access  to 
such  information  because  of  cost  or  lan-
guage barriers. 

The link between the free ﬂ ow of ideas 
and  economic  development  is  somewhat 
ambiguous and not well researched. A free 
press  generally  reduces  corruption  and 
increases public accountability.26 An indica-
tor of press freedom reported annually since 
2002  by  Reporters  without  Borders  covers 
freedom and security in reporting, govern-
ment control of media, restrictions on Inter-
net providers, and censorship of content.27 
Western industrial countries generally have 
a high degree of freedom. Many low-income 
countries have high restrictions on the media 
and Internet trafﬁ c. Signiﬁ cant restrictions 
persist in parts of Africa, East Asia, the Mid-
dle East, and the former Soviet Union. 

Some divisions are beyond the control 
of individual countries
Countries  for  the  most  part  are  free  to 
determine  their  openness  to  the  outside 
world. But geography and history produce 
divisions over which countries have little or

no control. These include being landlocked, 
being  in  a  remote  location  (especially  if 
combined  with  small  size),  and  having  a 
high degree of ethnic or cultural heteroge-
neity within and across borders.

Landlocked.  There  are  43  landlocked 
countries  in  the  world.  Being  landlocked 
reduces growth by at least half a percentage 
point.28 Boxes 3.1 and 3.2 illustrate further 
the costs of being landlocked. Small surprise 
then,  that  many  landlocked  countries  are 
among the world’s poorest. But being land-
locked in itself is not a cause of  poverty—look 
at Botswana, Luxembourg, and Switzerland. 
The problem is being landlocked with poor 
neighbors  or  being  landlocked  far  from 
markets.29 Often the two go together. Africa 
has the most landlocked countries (15), and 
Eastern Europe and Central Asia the high-
est  proportion—about  half  (see  map  3.3). 
Bhutan, Lao People’s Democratic Republic, 
and Nepal in Asia, and Bolivia and Paraguay 
in South America are other poor landlocked 
countries.

BOX 3.1    A country’s neighborhood matters: regional integration and growth spillovers 

Spillovers of growth from across borders 
are among the main benefi ts of regional 
integration.a In a more integrated economic 
space, the long-run growth prospects of 
countries become interlinked as markets 
of neighboring countries become more 
accessible. Growth in neighboring countries 
enhances domestic growth, which benefi ts 
neighbors. This spatial multiplier enhances 
the rewards to good policy and contributes 
to convergence in living standards.
Quantifying the benefi ts of growth 
spillovers
From 1970 to 2000, membership in a 
common regional trade agreement (RTA) 
among neighbors was associated with a 
growth spillover of 13.6 to 15.3 percent, 
so every percentage point increase in 
the average growth rate of RTA partners 
brought a “growth bonus” of 0.14 percent 
to supplement domestic growth. Associ-
ated with this is a spatial multiplier of 1.14 
to 1.18, with regional integration increas-
ing the eff ectiveness of growth-promot-
ing domestic policies by 14 to 18 percent.
In Europe and East Asia, where regional 

integration has been strongest, the 
benefi ts over the past few decades have 
been even larger. For these countries the 

average growth spillover between 1970 
and 2000 was 15.3 to 17.0 percent. This 
contributed to a slow, but steady, conver-
gence in living standards, with the gap in 
prosperity between the poorest and rich-
est OECD countries closing at an average 
rate of 1.59 to 1.85 percent a year. Along 
with this, the eff ectiveness of growth-
promoting domestic policies has been 
supplemented by 18.1 to 20 percent.
In Sub-Saharan Africa the average 
growth spillover has been far weaker, 
signaling the relative lack of regional inte-
gration despite a plethora of RTAs. The 
growth spillover is estimated at only 2.9 to 
3.9 percent, implying a spatial multiplier of 
only 1.01 to 1.04. This fi nding of virtually no 
growth spillovers holds when neighbors 
are defi ned by contiguity rather than RTA 
membership. A typical Sub-Saharan coun-
try’s growth rate was basically indepen-
dent of the growth rates of its neighbors.
Implications for landlocked and 
resource-poor countries in Sub-
Saharan Africa
Under current conditions, if the Sub-
 Saharan countries whose natural endow-
ments are most favorable sustained 
a growth takeoff , the landlocked and 

resource-poor countries of Central Africa 
would be left further behind. 

If Switzerland had been subject to the 
same low spillovers experienced by the 
Central African Republic between 1970 
and 2000, its GDP per capita in 2000 
would have been 9.3 percent lower, with 
a cumulative GDP loss of $334 billion 
(2000 constant U.S. dollars), or 162 per-
cent of Swiss GDP (see the fi gure below).

BOX 3.2    Bolivia and Chile’s border—from wide to narrow? 

Bolivia illustrates the economic 
dependence of a landlocked country 
on its neighbors and how economic 
integration could help overcome 
these divisions. After a war with Chile 
in the late-nineteenth century, Bolivia 
lost its access to the Pacifi c, and Peru, 
Bolivia’s ally, also lost territory to 
Chile. 

Chile and Bolivia have not had 

diplomatic relations since 1978, but 
they are now talking. A motive for 
Chile is natural gas. Since 1995 it 
has relied almost exclusively on gas 
from Argentina, but supplies have 
been limited by high demand in 
Argentina. 

Bolivia has South America’s 

second-largest natural gas reserves. 
So economic integration could be an 
incentive for resolving regional dis-
putes. Chile would gain from energy 
imports from Bolivia; Bolivia would 
benefi t from better access to ports, 
which would make it easier to export. 
Peru would likely be involved in any 
agreement because it provides an 
alternative, though less economic, 
route to the coast for Bolivia and

provides a ready market and large labor force. 
 Conversely, small countries lack the scale, 
capacity,  and  stock  of  production  factors 
to achieve high economic growth by them-
selves.  But  as  with  being  landlocked,  size 
by itself is not a determining factor. What 
determines economic prosperity is a coun-
try’s economic integration with the rest of 
the  world.30  Luxembourg  ranks  167th  in 
population but has the world’s highest GDP 
per capita. Fully integrated in the European 
Union (EU), its highly specialized ﬁ nancial 
sector  operates  globally.  Small  countries 
should  thus  favor  economic  integration, 
because  they  will  gain  most  from  freer 
trade and openness.

In  world  regions  that  are  more  highly 
integrated, parts of a country therefore have 
less incentive to remain within a nation dom-
inated by another cultural or ethnic group. 
Devolution in the United Kingdom and sepa-
ratist movements in Spain conﬁ rm this. Sim-

Europe with the disintegration of the former 
Yugoslavia was in part facilitated by the pros-
pect of EU accession for the newly indepen-
dent countries. Noneconomic considerations

Sea-locked countries. Being landlocked 
can generate an island effect, preventing a 
country  from  beneﬁ ting  from  neighbor-
ing suppliers and markets. Small islands in 
remote  locations  suffer  similar  isolation; 
they are essentially “sea-locked.” They face 
high transport costs for exports and imports, 
higher  costs  for  energy  and  intermediate 
inputs, and typically higher wage costs and 
rents. The problems are acute for the small 
island nations of the Paciﬁ c.31 Trade prefer-
ences  to  support  them  until  they  become 
competitive in world markets have gener-
ated large and unsustainable inefﬁ ciencies 
in  production.  And  large  per  capita  aid 
ﬂ ows have had only limited impact on their 
competitiveness.  Closely  linking  up  with 
wealthier “patron” countries and increasing 
labor mobility may be the only strategies.32 
Small  island  states  in  the  Caribbean,  by 

contrast, have more diversiﬁ ed economies 
and,  being  closer  to  rich  markets,  beneﬁ t 
more from tourism and trade. 

Mauritius  shows  that  good  policy  can 
overcome small size and remote location. It

India allows it to capture offshoring activi-

Five benefi ts of being a large country: 
•  Smaller per capita cost of providing 

many public goods, such as a judi-
cial system or embassies. 

•  Larger home market, which can 
increase productivity and thus 
benefi t economic growth. 

•  Stronger buff er to regional economic 

shocks—if a region that specializes 
in, say, agriculture suff ers a recession, 
the impacts can be reduced through 
transfers from other regions, and 
workers can seek employment else-
where in the country. 

•  More eff ective redistributive schemes 

to reduce gaps in after-tax incomes 
between rich and poor regions.

•  Better ability to provide security, 
as the per capita cost of defense 
declines. 
A possible disadvantage is the 

greater heterogeneity of preferences 
and thus the larger coordination 
costs in large democracies. Diversity 
also makes it harder to overcome col-
lective action problems.

Ethnic  and  cultural  divisions.  Ethno-
linguistic  heterogeneity  imposes  a  coor-
dination  cost  on  countries,  because  it 
often  reﬂ ects  differences  in  attitudes  or 
interests  that  need  to  be  reconciled  by 
national   governments.  Consider  the  dif-
ferences  in  opinion  about  joining  the  EU 
among the French- and German-speaking 
parts  of  Switzerland.  This  heterogene-
ity also has implications for labor mobil-
ity. For instance, the Euro zone may be a 
less resilient common currency area than 
the  United  States,  because  its  higher  cul-
tural heterogeneity hinders adjustments to 
shocks through internal migration. Ethnic 
heterogeneity is often associated with civil 
conﬂ ict and with high costs for economic 
growth.

Empirical evidence for the impact of cul-
tural diversity is mixed (see also box 3.4). 
Ethnic fragmentation is negatively associ-
ated  with  the  quality  of  government  and 
with economic growth.33 The relationship 
between ethnic heterogeneity and conﬂ ict 

Map 3.4    Language diversity is very high in Africa

is statistically signiﬁ cant only in countries 
where one group is in the majority but the 
minority  groups  are  still  powerful—for 
example, Burundi and Iraq.34 In most cases 
ethnic or cultural differences are unlikely 
to be the cause of conﬂ ict. But ethnic dif-
ferences  are  exploited  to  achieve  other 
objectives, such as gaining political power 
or  control  over  resources.  Ethnicity  also 
interacts in complex ways with other facets 
of society. Autocracy, for example, reduces 
growth in ethnically diverse countries more 
than in ethnically homogenous ones.

Linguistic  diversity  varies  greatly 
between  world  regions.  The  Ethnologue 
database  includes  information  on  almost 
7,000 languages, including their  location. 
The  heterogeneity  of  language  groups  is 
very high in Africa and generally increases 
with proximity to the Equator (see map 3.4 
and ﬁ gure 3.6). Although empirical cross-
country studies suggest that linguistic frac-
tionalization hurts economic performance, 
a regional trading language has tradition-
ally helped overcome the divisions: Hindi 
and  Urdu  in  a  large  part  of  South  Asia,

Economic costs of conﬂ ict 
and territorial disputes
Impermeable borders tend to reduce eco-
nomic growth. But full political uniﬁ cation 
between  countries  would  not  necessar-
ily  improve  economic  performance.35  A 
full merger of two countries has a positive 
country  size  effect  but  an  overall  slightly 
negative impact on growth due to reduced 
trade  with  the  rest  of  the  world.  Only  in 
a few instances would both partners ben-
eﬁ t from full political and economic inte-
gration.  But  integration  of  neighboring 
markets  without  political  integration,  on 
average,  would  increase  growth  across 
countries signiﬁ cantly. 

Borders  further  reduce  economic  ben-
efits  where  divisions  are  aggravated  by 
conﬂ ict within or between countries. Even 
when  conﬂ ict  does  not  involve  military 
action, the cost can be signiﬁ cant. Territo-
rial disputes impose high international eco-
nomic transaction costs because of insecure 
property rights and jurisdictional and pol-
icy uncertainty. Economic models suggest 
that the territorial dispute between Argen-
tina and Chile reduced trade between the 
two countries by $33 billion between 1950 
and 1995.36 The competing claims between 
Japan  and  Russia  over  the  Kurile  Islands 
lowered trade by $535 billion between 1952 
and  1995.  And  those  between  Indonesia 
and  Malaysia  cost  $11.5  billion  between 
1980 and 1995. Similar disputes exist over 
maritime boundaries, only about one-third 
of which are settled by treaty.37 

When disputes turn to military confron-
tation, the costs are considerably higher—
not only in loss of life, but also in economic 
terms. The cost of a “typical” civil war is 
about $64 billion, and an average annual 
worldwide  cost  of  about  $100  billion  far 
exceeds global aid ﬂ ows.38 A civil war in a 
neighboring country is estimated to reduce 
a country’s annual growth by about half a 

BOX 3.4    Artiﬁ cial states?

Gathered in Berlin in 1884–85, the 
colonial powers determined Africa’s 
borders with little concern for social 
or economic divisions. Many borders 
in the Middle East were similarly 
drawn at the end of World War I.a 
 Alesina, Easterly, and Matuszeski 
identify “artifi cial states” with a 
measure of how straight a country’s 
border is and whether these borders 
partition ethnic groups into two or 
more countries.b Northern Africa, 
Northeast Asia, and South Africa have 
the most artifi cial (straight) borders, 
while South Asia and Western Africa 
are the most partitioned. Eastern and 
Central Africa are among the top four 
regions in both categories. 

Empirical analysis suggests that 

artifi cial borders hurt economic and 
social outcomes. But this link is less 
signifi cant after controlling for colo-

nial origin or location in Africa. Artifi -
cial borders are not associated with a 
higher probability of war, refl ecting 
similar results on ethnic diversity and 
confl ict found by Paul Collier.c 

So, avoiding economic and political 
problems associated with ethnic diver-
sity would require cultural homogene-
ity within countries. In Africa this would 
imply a far larger number of countries. 
Yet the already small size of many Afri-
can countries is perhaps a more severe 
problem—it prevents countries from 
reaching sustainable economic scale. 
As argued in this Report, the appropri-
ate response to small size and ethnic 
diversity is closer integration and more 
permeable boundaries.

increase their military spending by 2 per-

and  disruption  of  preferred  trade  routes. 
The civil war in the Democratic Republic 
of Congo closed river access to the sea for

Economic concentration
Economic output is spatially  concentrated—
by  any  measure  and  across  geographic 
scales. Looking at grid cells, a quarter of the 
world’s GDP is produced on just 0.3 percent 
of the land area (about the size of Camer-
oon), half on 1.5 percent, and nine-tenths 
on  16  percent.39  China,  Japan,  and  the 
United States produced about half of global 
GDP in 2006, and the 15 largest economies 
produced about 80 percent.

Early in the Industrial Revolution, at the 
beginning of the nineteenth century, GDP 
per capita in today’s industrialized coun-
tries was about twice that of today’s devel-
oping  and  emerging  countries  (see  table 
3.1).  But  total  GDP  in  China  and  India, 
which had far larger populations, was more 
than twice that in today’s G7 countries. By

the middle of the twentieth century, the G7 
countries accounted for more than half of 
global output (about 60 percent if the other 
western industrial countries are included). 
North  America  and  Japan  grew  the  fast-
est  at  3.5  and  2.8  percent  a  year  between 
1820  and  1998.40  The  four  largest  Euro-
pean economies grew at an annual average 
of about 2 percent, not very different from 
growth rates in Africa, Eastern Europe, and 
the smaller Asian developing countries. But 
while  GDP  growth  exceeded  population 
growth by 1.7 points in the G7, it did so by 
only 0.8 points in China and India and by 
0.7 points in Africa. Over the 180 years to 
the end of the twentieth century, these dif-
ferent growth rates moved the concentra-
tion of economic production more toward 
the northern industrialized countries.

How did this concentration come about?
The  concentration  of  economic  mass  in 
today’s western industrialized countries and 
Japan  has  its  roots  in  eighteenth-century 
economic  and  technological  innovation. 
Europe’s economic growth accelerated greatly 
during the Industrial Revolution, with mod-
ern manufacturing starting in Great Britain 
in the mid-eighteenth century and gradually 
spreading across the continent. At the begin-
ning of this process, Western Europe had less 
than 20 percent of global GDP.41 By the end of 
the nineteenth century, it had more than 30 
percent, three-quarters of it in the four larg-
est economies—France, Germany, Italy, and 
the United Kingdom (see also ﬁ gure 3.7). 

This growth occurred against a backdrop 
of  frequent  conﬂ ict  between   neighboring 
countries,  constant  changes  of  alliances, 
and  mergers  and  disintegrations  of  coun-
tries.  At  the  beginning  of  the  nineteenth 
century, Germany included about 300 indi-
vidual states. It had 1,800 customs borders, 
with  Prussia  alone  having  67  local  tariff 
zones.42  Only  in  the  1870s  did  Germany 
fully  integrate  domestically.  Even  with  a 
patchwork of economic regions in Europe, 
trade ﬂ ows had always been large, thanks to 
local or regional agreements. These expand-
ing trade links inspired the work of David 
Ricardo,  who  in  1817  famously  described 
the  exchange  of  textiles  and  port  wine 
between Great Britain and Portugal in his 
theory of comparative advantage. Ricardo’s 
work motivated further trade liberalization 
by governments, most of all Britain’s.

Formal  economic  integration  did  not 
begin  until  the  middle  of  the  twentieth

century. Motivated by political as much as 
economic  objectives,  six  European  coun-
tries,  accounting  for  about  a  quarter  of 
world GDP, joined in a treaty liberalizing 
trade in coal and steel. Annual GDP growth 
accelerated in subsequent years to around 
4.5 percent, up from only around 1 percent 
in the 35 years after World War I. Although 
the relative shares of European countries in 
world GDP dropped somewhat, the com-
bined EU economy maintains a share of 25 
percent, largely through enlargement to its 
current 27 member countries. 

Europe’s economic progress was exported 
to English-speaking “offshoots” in Australia, 
New Zealand, and North America. Between 
1820  and  the  late-twentieth  century,  their 
economies grew by about 3.6 percent, almost 
twice the population growth of 1.9 percent, 
driven  by  massive  migration  mostly  from 
Europe and Asia. Their share of global GDP 
increased from 2 percent to 25 percent during 
that time, the lion’s share by the United States 
(22  percent).  Cultural  proximity  and  close 
trade ties meant that innovations crossed the 
Atlantic quickly in both directions.

Japan started to industrialize fairly late. 
In 1820 its GDP per capita was half that in 
North America and Western Europe, a ratio 
that did not change until the twentieth cen-
tury. GDP growth between 1820 and 1870 
was  0.4  percent  a  year.  Industrialization 
began to accelerate after the Meiji Restora-
tion in the 1860s. The fastest growth rates 
were in the second half of the twentieth cen-
tury. Between 1950 and 1973, as the coun-
try  opened  to  the  world  economy,  Japan’s 
economy grew at a rate of almost 9 percent 
a year. By the late 1980s, its GDP per capita 
was higher than Western Europe’s.

How did the rest of the world do?
The share of the largest industrial economies 
in world GDP has fallen slightly, from 51 per-
cent in 1950 to 46 percent in 1998.43 Among 
emerging  economies,  Eastern  Europe  and 
Russia  reduced  their  share  from  almost  5 
percent to 2.4 percent in the late 1980s and 
early 1990s. The smaller shares of industrial 
countries and Eastern Europe are largely due 
to increases in Asia (see ﬁ gure 3.8). South-
east Asia and the Paciﬁ c doubled its share

to about 1.8 percent, and South Asia’s share 
of global GDP rose from 1.4 to 2.4 percent. 
The largest increase has occurred in North-
east Asia since the mid-1980s, essentially in 
China, where the share of global GDP rose 
from less than 1 percent to about 5.5 percent. 
Shares in the remaining World Development 
Report  2009  regions  remained  essentially 
unchanged despite considerably higher pop-
ulation growth.44 

Why does this matter? The importance 
of market access
The  distribution  of  economic  production 
globally matters greatly for the development 
prospects of countries because of the interac-
tion of density and distance at a global scale. 
This  is  demonstrated  by  the  close  empiri-
cal  relationship  between  trade  as  a  driver 
of growth and two variables that deﬁ ne the 
well-known gravity model of trade: (1) the 
distance between trading partners, and (2) 
their  economic  size  as  measured  by  GDP 

(see box 3.5). Trade decreases with distance 
and increases with GDP, so any country will 
trade more with nearby countries and with 
countries  that  have  a  larger  GDP.  Despite 
reductions in transport and communication 
costs, the trade-reducing impact of distance 
increased  until  about  a  half  century  ago, 
remaining “puzzlingly” high since then (see, 
for example, for Brazil in ﬁ gure 3.9).45

This empirical evidence may be at odds 
with  the  rapidly  increasing  long-distance 
trade between, say, China and the United 
States  or  between  Japan  and  Europe.  But 
this increase in trade may not be so much 
due  to  trade  cost  reductions.  It  is  largely 
driven  by  the  other  factor  in  the  grav-
ity trade relationship: economic output.46 
China’s GDP has increased, providing the 
economic  mass  to  export  goods  to  inter-
national markets and to import consumer 
goods, capital equipment, and intermediate 
inputs. Increasing trade, in a self-reinforc-
ing  process,  generates  scale  economies  in 

BOX 3.5    Market access and per capita incomes 

Quantifying market access (sometimes 
called “market potential”) is not just of 
theoretical interest. Empirical studies have 
shown that market and supplier access 
have a signifi cant impact on growth and 
income. For instance, halving a country’s 
distance from its trading partners is associ-
ated with a 25 percent increase in per capita 
income—more than the combined eff ect of 
a coastal location and open trade policies.a 
Trade benefi ts a country by raising factor 
incomes (wages) through expenditures by 
trading partners for goods produced in that 
country. The level of expenditures is in large 
part determined by the size of the trading 
partner’s economy (density) and by physical 
market access, largely determined by prox-
imity to trading partners (distance) and the 
eff ect of borders (division).b 

Between 1970 and 2003, the distribution 
of per capita income spread out, refl ecting 
greater global inequality among coun-
tries—the poorest countries now have 
smaller incomes relative to the United 
States (see the fi gures at the right). The dis-
tribution also moves to the right, implying 
that market potential is increasing almost 
everywhere as a result of global GDP 
growth. And its slope is getting steeper, so 

the returns to market potential are increas-
ing—the same amount of market poten-
tial buys more per capita income—at least 
for some countries.

There continues to be a large variance of 
GDP per capita at any given market poten-
tial. Haiti’s market potential is higher than 
New Zealand’s. Its proximity to the United 
States raises its market potential, refl ecting 
the interaction between economic size 

and distance from markets. For any given 
level, the size of the economy determines 
how well a country can take advantage of 
market access. Rich countries like Australia 
and New Zealand can compensate for a 
remote location by off ering a fairly large 
market and supply capacity.

the trade infrastructure and services, such 
as  efﬁ cient  ports  and  frequent  container 
shipping links (see chapter 6). Larger econ-
omies and richer countries can thus over-
come  the  friction  of  long  trade  distances 
with higher economic density.

Divergence, then convergence
The  changing  geographic  distribution  of 
world economic output reﬂ ects the concen-
tration of economic mass initially in West-
ern  Europe  and  later  in  North  America. 
More  recently,  some  deconcentration  has 
occurred as ﬁ rst Japan and then other econ-
omies in the East Asia region have grown. 
China and India are reclaiming their posi-
tion among the countries and regions with 
the highest shares of global GDP. Country 
access to input and output markets inﬂ uence 
the geographic distribution of absolute levels 

of economic output. As these distributions 
change, so too do the prospects of national 
economies. These, in turn, inﬂ uence devel-
opment outcomes at the regional and coun-
try levels, reﬂ ected in levels and changes in 
income,  health,  and  human  capital.  This 
human  capital,  most  often  considered  an 
input contributing to human development, 
is also a development outcome that raises the 
quality of life for individuals. 

Three broad trends:

(cid:129)  A general increase in income and basic 
living standards globally, but with some 
big exceptions. 

(cid:129)  Considerable  divergence  of  incomes 
between  the  richest  and  the  poorest 
countries, but some global convergence 
in health and education.

(cid:129)  Some  convergence  within  the  faster 

growing regions.

General improvements
Today’s  generation,  by  almost  any  global 
summary measure of income and welfare, 
is  better  off  than  any  previous  generation 
in human history. GDP per capita in 1990 
international dollars increased tenfold from 
$565 to $5,700 over the last 500 years, while 
population grew from 400 million to more 
than 6 billion (table 3.2). Since 1820 output 
growth has been about 2.2 percent a year, 
bringing with it a considerable rise in living 
standards. Life expectancy at birth rose from

26.5 years in 1820 to 32.8 years in 1910 to 
about 68 years in 2005.47 In the last 35 years 
alone,  average  global  life  expectancy  grew 
by about 10 years. And a much larger share 
of the world’s population now has access to 
basic education. In 1870 the mean years of 
schooling  was  1.1  years,  and  the  adult  lit-
eracy rate 25.5 percent.48 By 1929, schooling 
had increased to 2.5 years, and by 2000, to 
6.7 years, and literacy to 43.8 percent and 
then to 78.3 percent (see ﬁ gure 3.10). 

Considerable income divergence between 
the richest and poorest countries, but 
improvements in health and education
Over the past 500 years, per capita output 
increased 40-fold in Japan and 65-fold in 
Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the 
United  States  (see  table  3.2).49  In  Africa 
it  increased  only  threefold,  and  in  Asia 
(not  including  Japan),  ﬁ vefold.  Spreads 
between the poorest and the richest regions 
increased from a factor of 2 in 1500 and 5 in 
1870 to almost 20 by the end of the twenti-
eth century. During the past two centuries, 
the Gini coefﬁ cient of inequality increased 
by 30 percent. Per capita income inequality 
among world citizens increased by 60 per-
cent, as measured by the Theil index, largely 
because  of  income  divergence  between 
countries rather than within countries.50

The  main  story  is  one  of  an  enormous 
increase  in  per  capita  incomes  in  Europe 
and  its  offshoots.  More  recently  this  has 
happened  in  East  Asia,  with  Japan,  whose 
GDP per capita has increased tenfold since 
1950, and was followed by the Republic of 
Korea; Taiwan, China; China; and countries 
in  South  Asia.  GDP  per  capita  in  China, 
though still low in absolute terms, grew at 
8.4 percent a year between 1990 and 2005. At 
the low end of the income distribution, total 
GDP in the Central Africa region increased 
threefold between 1960 and 2006, compared 
with Northeast Asia’s 30-fold increase (see 
ﬁ gure  3.11).  With  population  growth  out-
pacing economic growth, per capita incomes 
in Central Africa fell by 8 percent in constant 
prices. Incomes in the poorest countries in 
the world—mostly landlocked and many in 
Africa, home to the “bottom billion” of the 
world’s population—declined by 5 percent 
during the 1990s.51

Between 1960 and the late 1980s, almost 
every country in the world showed contin-
ual increases in life expectancy at birth.52 In 
South Asia it increased from 42 years to 60, 
and in Northern Africa from 47 years to 65. 
The  exception  was  in  Sub-Saharan  Africa. 
Until the late 1980s, life expectancy increased 
slowly  in  Western,  Central,  and  Eastern 
Africa and slightly faster in Southern Africa, 
where it rose from 46 years to about 60. Since 
then, however, the HIV/AIDS epidemic has 
caused a large increase in mortality, bringing 
life expectancy in Southern Africa below its 
level in 1960. In Central and Eastern Africa, 
life  expectancy  is  down  less  dramatically, 
and Western Africa contained the epidemic 
and saw only a slight decline in the rate of 
improvement.  Nine  of  the  10  countries 
showing the worst trends are in Sub-Saharan 
Africa, and most of these are in Southern or 
Southeastern Africa (see ﬁ gure 3.12). 

Similar to life expectancy, global inequal-
ity in access to education fell sharply from 
a  Gini  coefﬁ cient  for  years  of  schooling  of 
0.79 in 1870 to 0.39 in 2000.53 The high Gini 
coefﬁ cient  in  the  nineteenth  century  was 
largely due to near-universal primary edu-
cation in Western Europe and its offshoots. 
Other world regions started expanding edu-
cation  much  later,  and  inequality  dropped

to lowest population-weighted average educa-
tion dropped from 9.7 years to 3.1.56 These 
improvements  have  been  fairly  uniform 
across regions, so the difference between the 
highest and lowest region has remained essen-
tially constant. Because poorer countries start 
from a far lower level, however, their percent-
age improvements are much higher, suggest-
ing eventual convergence. 

Some income convergence within 
faster-growing regions
Neighboring countries can provide mutually 
beneﬁ cial economic linkages, spillovers, and 
complementarities that allow whole groups 
of countries to increase their incomes. If this 
increases growth rates in poorer countries,

Figure 3.15    Divergence, then convergence in East Asia, 1950–2006 
Countries with populations greater than 1 million, coefficient of variation and GDP per capita growth

economies should converge over time. Will 
poor countries eventually catch up with the 
rich?  The  question  received  considerable 
attention among growth economists in the 
late 1980s and 1990s.57 They produced tools 
and  techniques  to  analyze  convergence, 
relating growth to initial income, with the 
expectation that lower initial status is asso-
ciated with higher growth rates. But there 
has been little, if any, convergence between 
countries globally over the past ﬁ ve decades 
(see ﬁ gure 3.14). There is even some indica-
tion of divergence, though the trend is weak. 
Within world regions, the evidence is much 
more differentiated.

Regional integration and temporal dynam-
ics make the study of convergence important. 
First, economic fortunes are shaped by what 
neighboring countries do, and successful eco-
nomic integration—overcoming divisions—
can pull weaker countries toward incomes 
that they cannot achieve in isolation. Higher 
convergence  would  be  expected  in  regions 
that have integrated. Second, in fast-growing 
regions,  there  initially  is  divergence  as  the 
leading  regional  economies  pull  away,  but 
later there is convergence as poor countries 
beneﬁ t from growth spillovers and begin to 
catch up over time.

In  East  Asia,  the  fastest-growing  world 
region  in  recent  years,  convergence  fol-
lowed initial divergence. From 1950 to 1970, 
incomes diverged sharply as ﬁ rst Japan; and 
later Hong Kong, China; and then Singapore 
grew at very high rates (see ﬁ gures 3.15 and 
3.16a). In the 1970s other countries joined 
the fast-growth club, notably the Republic of

Korea and Taiwan, China. Between 1976 and 
1992, what looked like moderate divergence 
(see ﬁ gure 3.16b) actually represented two 
groups of countries on separate but closely 
linked convergence paths (see ﬁ gure 3.16c). 
Overall, this led to a strong regional conver-
gence as the variation among country GDPs 
per  capita—while  still  large—dropped  to 

levels last seen in 1960. This convergence has 
much to do with market policies in China 
and Vietnam as well as with a special blend 
of regional economic integration against a 
backdrop of globalization. 

There are few signs of convergence where 
growth has been sluggish and regional inte-
gration limited, as in Western Asia and East-
ern Europe (see ﬁ gure 3.17). Western Asia 
includes resource-rich countries, with low 
and high populations, as well as resource-
poor countries, such as Jordan. Low levels 
of intraregional trade indicate low levels of 
integration. Eastern Europe shows low varia-
tion in per capita income until about 1990.58 
After the disintegration of the Soviet Union 
and  the  fall  of  the  Berlin  Wall,  per  capita 
incomes dropped drastically in some coun-
tries and moderately in others. This diver-
gence  was  reinforced  as  the  western-most 
countries reoriented their economic linkages 
toward Western Europe, eventually joining 
the  EU.  Belarus  and  initially  Ukraine,  by 
contrast, maintained close links to the Rus-
sian Federation, which only recently began 
beneﬁ ting  from  natural  resource–driven 
economic growth. 

The  southernmost  economies  in  the 
Latin America and Caribbean region expe-
rienced relatively low growth and limited 
convergence (see box 3.6). At the northern 
end of the region, in 1994, Mexico entered 
the ﬁ rst major regional free trade pact that 
includes  both  industrial  and  developing 
countries. The North American Free Trade 
Agreement (NAFTA) eliminated tariffs on 
most products traded between the United 
States, Canada, and Mexico. The evidence 
since then illustrates three points about for-
mal regional integration processes:59
(cid:129)  Formal integration followed many years 
of  preparation,  gradual  informal  inte-
gration,  and  domestic  policy  changes. 
Mexico unilaterally reduced trade barri-
ers and implemented regulatory changes 
long before the agreement took effect.

(cid:129)  The agreement led to large increases in 
trade and foreign direct investment (FDI) 
ﬂ ows.  Economic  analysis  suggests  that 
without NAFTA, Mexico’s global exports 
would have been about 50 percent lower 
and its FDI 40 percent lower. This likely 
contributed to signiﬁ cant poverty reduc-

tion and income growth. GDP per capita 
in 2002 may have been as much as 4 per-
cent lower without NAFTA.

(cid:129)  Despite  these  positive  impacts  on  the 
Mexican economy, the agreement has not 
produced rapid convergence in incomes 
(see  ﬁ gure  3.18).  Mexico  has  avoided 
major economic crises, suggesting greater 
stability that can have signiﬁ cant welfare 
effects.60 But its performance relative to 
the U.S. economy has not differed much 
from that of several other Latin Ameri-
can economies.

The large differences in economic output 
will likely remain signiﬁ cant for some time. 
In fact, steady-state convergence estimates 
suggest  that  Mexican  incomes  will  reach 
only  about  half  of  U.S.  incomes.  Among 
the main reasons are signiﬁ cant differences 
in the quality of domestic institutions, in 
the innovation dynamics of ﬁ rms, and in 
the skills of the labor force. These will all

BOX 3.6    Neighborhoods matter: Southern Cone versus Southern Europe

Half a century ago the countries in the 
southern cone of South America— 
Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Uruguay—
had per capita incomes similar to or 
higher than the three Southern European 
countries with which they had strong cul-
tural bonds—Italy, Portugal, and Spain. 
The two groups have since followed dif-
ferent growth trajectories. For most of 
this period, the Southern Cone countries, 
except Chile, followed similar protection-
ist policies. Between 1950 and 2006 the 

four countries’ GDP per capita grew by an 
average 1.7 percent a year. 

Economic dynamics in Southern 

Europe unfolded diff erently. Italy was one 
of the founding members of the Euro-
pean Community, and Portugal and Spain 
joined in 1986 after emerging from a long 
period under authoritarian regimes. From 
lower levels, they grew at more than 3 
percent a year, far outpacing Latin Amer-
ica. While incomes converged in both 
regions, they did so faster in Western 

Europe at around 1 percent a year than in 
South America at 0.3 percent. Italy, Por-
tugal, and Spain benefi ted from regional 
growth spillovers, proximity to large mar-
kets, and cohesion policies within a single 
integrated Western European market. In 
the Southern Cone, regional integration 
was slow, and integration with wealthy 
markets in the Western Hemisphere was 
neglected for long periods.

Geography, globalization, 
and development
Four  main  aspects  explain  the  persis-
tent  regional  concentration  of  economic 
wealth  over  the  past  few  centuries,  with 

new countries or regions only occasionally 
breaking into the ranks of the rich. First, 
physical geography has helped some coun-
tries  become  rich  initially  but  continues 
to hold back others. Second, the forces of 
economic  geography—starting  from  an 
initial advantage, such as technical inno-
vation during the Industrial Revolution—
facilitated  agglomeration  economies  and

reinforced the concentration of economic 
activity. Third, regional spillovers increased 
economic activity in other countries within 
a region, further increasing the scale and 
scope  of  economic  production.  Fourth, 
entirely new regions of economic concen-
tration emerged—as a response to conges-
tion and a shift in established regions from 
manufacturing  to  services,  “freeing  up” 
manufacturing  opportunities  elsewhere. 
What does this imply for the prospects in 
today’s lagging world regions?

How much does geography matter 
today?
First-nature geography. Physical endow-
ments inﬂ uence the development prospects 
of  countries.  For  instance,  agricultural 
intensiﬁ cation in areas of good agroecolog-
ical endowments generates surpluses that 
can be shifted to more productive uses. But 
these assets are not distributed uniformly. 
As Landes (1998) puts it: “Nature like life 
is unfair, unequal in its favors.” Research-
ers  have  found  a  strong  correlation 
between economic output and geographic 
characteristics. A simple regression of out-
put  density  (GDP  per  square  kilometer) 
on  geographic  variables—mean  annual 
temperature, mean annual precipitation, 
mean elevation, terrain “roughness,” soil 
categories, and distance from coastline—
captures  91  percent  of  the  variability  in 
the  density  of  economic  production.61  A 
similar analysis explains 20 percent of the 
difference  in  per  capita  output  between 
tropical Africa and industrial regions, and 
12 percent of the difference between tropi-
cal Africa and other tropical regions. Cli-
mate also interacts with other factors, such 
as  disease.  Vector-borne  diseases  strike 
disproportionately  in  tropical  countries, 
reducing  productivity.  Malaria  is  esti-
mated  to  cause  approximately  1  million 
deaths and more than 200 million clinical 
events among Africans each year.62 Other 
purely geographic factors—such as being 
landlocked, which shaves half a percentage 
point off annual GDP growth, or a remote 
location—were discussed earlier.

Does  this  mean  that  geography  dic-
tates the destiny of countries? No. Physi-
cal geography helps explain initial growth 

differences  and  some  of  the  variation  in 
economic  outcomes.  But  most  of  these 
constraints can be overcome with enough 
resources. They are thus a proximate rather 
than an ultimate cause of underdevelop-
ment. High levels of malaria, for instance, 
may be as much a symptom of persistent 
poverty as a cause (see box 3.7). They are 
a grave concern for development interven-
tions  but  insufﬁ cient  to  explain  global 
patterns of economic wealth or to predict 
future growth potential by themselves.

Second-nature geography. An alterna-
tive  but  complementary  explanation  for 
global  development  patterns  shows  how 
small initial differences between countries 
and regions (for instance, natural endow-
ments) can, over time, generate large dis-
parities.  A  central  question  in  economic 
development is how much growth is due 
to  differences  in  human  and  physical 
capital  accumulation,  and  how  much  to 
the efﬁ ciency of using these factors.63 Evi-
dence from a growing number of studies 
conﬁ rms that levels of capital accumula-
tion alone are insufﬁ cient to explain cross-
country differences in growth and income. 
Instead, total factor productivity (TFP)—
how  efﬁ ciently  factors  of  production  are 
combined—tends  to  better  explain  dif-
ferences  in  growth  and  income  between 
countries.64 

TFP  is,  however,  a  vague  concept  that 
subsumes several aspects of economic pro-
duction. Most generally, it relates to better 
technology for combining inputs to gener-
ate products or services. This leads to cost 
reductions and thus increased competitive-
ness.  Complementarities,  spillovers,  and 
economies of scale also explain differences 
in TFP. Geographically, these externalities 
imply beneﬁ ts for producers to locate close 
to each other. Combined with scale econo-
mies  that  favor  larger  production  units, 
the  concentration  of  economic  activities 
increases  across  geographic  scales.  Euro-
pean economic growth during the modern 
era  was  initiated  by  the  industrial  revolu-
tion, which generated major technological 
advances. Improved technology and popu-
lation  growth  reinforced  scale  economies 
leading to concentrated centers of industri-
alization.  These  centers  attracted  workers

BOX 3.7    The inﬂ uence of ﬁ rst-nature geography: is it possible to eradicate malaria?

The species of Plasmodia that cause 
human malaria most likely reached their 
maximum global extent in 1900. Since 
that time the aff ected area has been pro-
gressively reduced by a regionally variable 
mixture of improving human conditions 
and deliberate control. The map below 
shows the diff erence between the widest 
hypothesized extent of the distribution 
of all types of human malaria around 
1900a and the contemporary limits of Plas-
modium falciparum,b the most clinically 
severe and epidemiologically important 
form of human malaria, in 2007. The for-
merly malarious areas are concentrated in 
the temperature latitude extremes of the 
parasite’s ancestral distribution, in both 
the Northern and Southern Hemispheres.

Researchers have documented the 

strong inverse correlation between the 
economic prosperity of nations and their 
contemporary malaria burden.c Richer 
countries have less malaria, poorer coun-
tries more. This work also documents the 
many mechanisms, from individual to 
macroeconomic, for malaria to contrib-
ute to poverty. What if the constraint of 
malaria were lifted? Is it possible to eradi-

cate malaria? The question has never been 
satisfactorily answered at the global scale.d

But it is possible to start addressing 
the problem. In the map below, risk is 
classifi ed as stable if more than 0.1 case is 
recorded per 1,000 population each year, 
unstable if below this fi gure, and zero if 
no cases have been recorded within the 
three most recent years of records. When 
overlaid on a population map for 2007,e 
2.37 billion people were found to live in 
areas with any risk of P. falciparum trans-
mission. Globally, almost 1 billion people 
lived under unstable, or extremely low, 
malaria risk. Conditions of low risk are 
typical in the Americas and in South and 
East Asia but are also common in Africa. 
For 1 billion people at risk of unstable 
malaria transmission, malaria elimination 
is epidemiologically feasible. Epidemio-
logical feasibility was determined by 
reference to historical experience during 
the global malaria eradication program 
and by inferring, through modeling, that 
transmission could be interrupted by tak-
ing  insecticide-treated bednets to scale.f 
There are many reasons in many regions 
why elimination may not be a simple mat-

ter of epidemiological feasibility. Political 
instability and geographic accessibility 
are obvious examples, but these are oper-
ational and not technical obstacles.

What can be achieved with the 1.37 
billion people suff ering stable risk? Ini-
tial evidence suggests that a substantial 
fraction of those aff ected will be living in 
areas of very low prevalence.g A detailed 
investigation with mathematical models 
could estimate the impact from the exist-
ing toolkit of interventions. When this esti-
mate combined with a detailed analysis 
of the data on the effi  ciency of historical 
interventions, considerable insight could 
follow. These approaches will help deter-
mine whether malaria is eradicable and, if 
so, under what time frame and with what 
resources.

and new ﬁ rms, instigating a virtuous, self-
reinforcing process that led to even greater 
concentration. 

Development is contagious, tending to 
spread  across  regions.  Although  growth 
centers may start within speciﬁ c areas in a 
country—the industrial belt in the north-
west of England or the mill towns in New 
England—dynamic centers tend to spread 
out.  At  the  international  level,  growth 
spreads to neighboring states, giving rise to 
regional growth centers. With enough open-
ness and interaction between countries, the 
mechanisms for spreading growth are tech-
nological spillovers and increasing special-
ization, breaking up production processes. 
This makes it more likely that some of the 
demand for intermediate products will be 
satisﬁ ed from neighboring countries. This 
can greatly expand trade, which produces 
scale economies and steep increases in eco-
nomic  productivity.  The  larger  labor  and 
capital  pools  and  the  greater  market  size 
that emerge due to gradual improvement of 
transport links can lead to the rapid takeoff 
of a regional economy.65

New  regions  of  growth  and  wealth  can 
emerge. This happens when growth in a core 
region has reached a point at which congestion 
and rising wages encourage entrepreneurs to 
seek new locations for production in nearby 
regions. This happened in Western Europe, 
when ﬁ rms relocated manufacturing capac-
ity to Central and Eastern European coun-
tries, and in North America, when Mexico 
attracted investment in manufacturing capac-
ity for the U.S. and Canadian markets. This 
contagion  model  of  region  building  would 
suggest  that  all  economic  activity  remains 
within an expanding contiguous zone—but 
it does not.

Under  some  conditions,  economic 
growth may leap to an entirely new region.66 
The  location  of  this  new  center  of  global 
manufacturing  depends  on  many  factors, 
including market size, trade and transaction 
costs,  initial  human  and  physical  capital 
endowments, and competition from other 
potential growth regions. This leapfrogging 
model matches the emergence of East Asia 
as a global hub initially for labor-intensive 
production  and  later  for  technologically 
more advanced production. Half a century 

ago, Japan would have seemed an unlikely 
source of inexpensive electronics and con-
sumer goods for the U.S. market given the 
distance  between  the  two  countries.  But 
the  emergence  of  containerized  shipping 
allowed Japanese producers to be competi-
tive in North American markets and later 
in  the  European  markets.67  The  Republic 
of  Korea  and  Taiwan,  China,  followed  in 
Japan’s  footsteps.  Manufacturing  invest-
ments spread from there to South Asia, par-
ticularly Malaysia and Thailand, and then, 
after economic liberalization, to China. 

What do we learn from this?

Size  matters  a  lot.  To  generate  scale 
economies, a certain population and an eco-
nomic mass need to be in place. In Europe 
during the Industrial Revolution, a relatively 
large and concentrated population provided 
both  the  labor  that  produced  manufac-
tures and the market that consumed them. 
North America, when it shifted from natu-
ral resources to industry, had a large popula-
tion along its eastern seaboard, which grew 
quickly with immigration from Europe and 
elsewhere. East Asia has a vast population, 
with ﬁ rst Japan and later China serving as 
engines  of  manufacturing  growth  in  the 
region. Each region beneﬁ ted from a large 
home market, but much of the production 
was soon destined for export both within the 
region and to the rest of the world.

Few  countries  have  lifted  their  eco-
nomic  fortunes  based  only  on  exports 
of  primary  commodities.  Botswana,  a 
sparsely populated country with large min-
eral wealth and good policies, is one excep-
tion. Well-managed mineral resources can 
help generate capital that can be invested in 
other sectors, but few countries have done 
this successfully. Agriculture—important 
for  subsistence,  for  rural  income  genera-
tion,  and  for  speciﬁ c  regions  in  a  coun-
try—cannot  by  itself  lift  poor  countries 
to  middle-  or  high-income  status.  Rural 
activities  are  either  too  small  in  scale  to 
provide sufﬁ cient surplus for export—or, 
in cases in which agricultural production 
has  sufﬁ cient  scale,  it  often  beneﬁ ts  only 
a few large landowners or agribusinesses. 
The verdict on services is still out. But it is 
unlikely that poor countries have enough

skilled  white-collar  workers  to  generate 
broad-based  growth  spillovers.  India  has 
a large export-oriented service sector, but 
it employs only about 560,000 of its more 
than  1  billion  inhabitants,  most  in  jobs 
in  constant-return  customer  support  and 
back-ofﬁ ce tasks.68 

Manufacturing  remains  important. 
Each  successful  world  region  has,  at  some 
point,  made  signiﬁ cant  and  broad-based 
gains with basic labor-intensive manufactur-
ing. This process initially led to a diversiﬁ ca-
tion of production as countries grew richer 
and  consumers  demanded  more  varieties. 
As  economies  in  these  regions  expanded, 
production and employment in individual 
countries started to specialize in what they 
were best at, giving rise to interlinked net-
works  of  production  trading  intermediate 
goods among countries within the region. 
This is the point at which China and some 
of  the  other  “second-wave”  economies  in 
East Asia have arrived. In Europe and other 
regions that industrialized earlier, the share 
of manufacturing in the economy has fallen 
quite rapidly, with only highly specialized 
manufacturing remaining, such as machine 
tools or information technology (IT) equip-
ment. In these countries, the service sector, 
including the research and design of prod-
ucts  that  will  be  manufactured  elsewhere, 
now accounts for the largest share, by far, of 
employment and economic output.

Openness helps a lot—but it has to be 
introduced with care. Each of today’s suc-
cessful regions initially developed its manu-
facturing sector behind a fairly substantive 
wall of tariffs and other protections. Only as 
their economies matured and became more 
dependent on foreign inputs and markets 
for their products did they gradually open 
their borders and integrate regionally and 
globally. The rise of interlinked production 
networks that cross international borders 
within each region required more coordi-
nation and cooperation among countries, 
not just for trade in goods and services, but 
also  to  settle  on  common  standards  and 
regulations. 

The process proceeded somewhat differ-
ently in each region, most formally within 
Europe,  where  the  EU’s  political  and  eco-
nomic integration superseded a patchwork 

BOX 3.8     Integration takes a long time, and its beneﬁ ts do 

not come overnight

In Europe, after the diff usion of mod-
ern industrial technology and the 
expansion of trade links in the early 
nineteenth century, it took more than 
100 years before formal integration 
processes began in the 1950s. Even 
then, the eff orts were limited to agree-
ments on narrowly focused economic 
issues between six countries. Gradually 
they expanded into additional areas 
of cooperation such as customs and 
nuclear energy. It took 16 years before 
these agreements were consolidated 
in the European Community in 1967. 
Membership expanded slowly, with 
three countries joining each decade 
between 1970 and 2000, and fi nally 
the addition of 12 Eastern and Central 
European countries by 2007. Just as 
the initial Coal and Steel Community 
formalized long-established economic 
and cultural ties between the member 
countries, each subsequent expansion 
followed a long period of ever-closer 
interaction between members and 
accession countries. 

Formal, de jure, integration thus fol-
lowed de facto integration, providing 
a framework and structure for deep-
ening already close relations. This 
gradual process allowed institutions 
to develop and gave labor, fi nancial, 
and product markets time to prepare 
for possibly harsh adjustments, par-
ticularly for recently joining countries 
with much smaller economies. Bul-
garia and Romania, which joined in 
2007, added 8.6 percent to the EU’s 
land area and 6.3 percent to its popu-
lation but only 1 percent to its GDP.a 
So the convergence of social and 
economic outcomes across member 
countries will also take longer. Assess-
ing the benefi ts from integration 
thus requires a long time horizon, as 
increased labor mobility, investment 
in private and public capital, and 
other structural changes accelerate 
growth in lagging member countries.

of bilateral agreements among a fairly large 
number  of  countries  (see  box  3.8).  East 
Asia, by contrast, has created tightly linked 
entrepreneurial production networks with 
relatively little formal protocol. Initial inte-
gration in North America was facilitated by 
a shared language and cultural background 
between Canada and the United States. The 
relatively  recent  addition  of  Mexico  has 
removed some divisions between economies 
of greatly different per capita incomes. 

Openness and integration are most ben-
eﬁ cial for smaller or landlocked countries 
whose access to world markets depends on 
neighboring countries. Luxembourg’s small 
size  does  not  matter,  because  it  is  tightly 
integrated  in  the  European  economy  and 
thus operates more like a specialized city in 
a  large  country.  Switzerland’s  being  land-
locked has not constrained the development 
of highly specialized manufacturing and ser-
vice sectors. It can connect to world markets 
by air or through neighboring countries, and 
its neighbors are signiﬁ cant destinations for

its outputs. Integration has enabled the two 
countries to beneﬁ t from specialization and 
scale  economies  that  would  otherwise  be 
achievable only in far larger countries.

To  facilitate  integration,  industrial 
regions invested heavily in physical infra-
structure that promotes intraregional trade. 
Initially, sea and river transport was most 
important  for  exporting  manufactured 
products, requiring good coastal and river 
ports. More recently, interrelated produc-
tion  processes  require  more  timely  avail-
ability of intermediate products, which has 
moved a larger proportion of trade to road, 
rail, and air links. 

What’s different for today’s 
developers?
Are the conditions today different, or is this 
just a continuing or recurring phase of glo-
balization similar to that of a hundred years 
ago? In fact, goods and factor markets may 
be no more closely linked today than they 
were  a  century  ago.  They  may  be  some-
what  more  integrated  for  trade,  no  more 
integrated  for  capital,  and  less  integrated 
for labor.69 So how can lagging regions and 
countries join the group of leading world 
regions? Do they need to wait their turn, 
or are there ways for them to break out of a 
geographic determinism?

Some clear differences in the current phase 
of globalization and economic development 
relate  to  the  dynamics  of  economic  geog-
raphy and the persisting divisions between 
countries. First, the scale and speed of eco-
nomic  integration  in  recent  decades  have 
been unprecedented. The economic liberal-
ization in China and India, as well as in Rus-
sia and South America, adds huge numbers 
of  unskilled  workers  to  global  production 
capacity.70  In  many  ways  this  is  a  reemer-
gence of those regions (Asia accounted for 
almost 60 percent of world GDP as recently 
as the early nineteenth century). 

China  and  India,  because  of  the  enor-
mous size of their home markets, are essen-
tially world regions of their own. With no 
formal internal divisions, they beneﬁ t from 
scale  economies  and  provide  the  incen-
tive  for  investors  and  trading  partners  to 

overcome  their  signiﬁ cant  external  bar-
riers—the  thick  borders  in  the  map  that 
opened this chapter (see map 3.2). Smaller 
countries  do  not  have  this  luxury.  They 
must learn to manage their borders more 
rapidly  to  achieve  economic  integration 
with their neighbors to attain competitive 
production scale and to access world mar-
kets.  Countries  and  regions  that  do  this 
faster will have an advantage, but it will not 
be easy. By providing a vast unskilled labor 
pool—and relatively little human or physi-
cal capital—countries like China and India 
can absorb new manufacturing capacity for 
a long time. These are precisely the types 
of  activities  that  might  provide  a  path  to 
middle  income  for  the  poorest  countries. 
China also demonstrates the beneﬁ ts of its 
economic rise for its neighbors. Almost all 
East Asian countries have sometimes sig-
niﬁ cant trade surpluses with China in most 
manufacturing sectors.71

Second,  there  has  been  an  unprec-
edented fragmentation of production pro-
cesses. This includes not only the intraﬁ rm 
division  of  manufacturing  steps  across 
several  places,  but  more  important  the 
intraindustry trade of increasingly special-
ized components and services, sometimes 
over long distances. Advances in communi-
cations technology facilitate these complex 
buyer-supplier  networks.  Although  inte-
grated in global markets, production tends 
to be regionally concentrated. For smaller 
countries,  this  may  be  both  a  threat  and 
an opportunity. The threat is that smaller 
countries with poor infrastructure and low 
skills  will  remain  outside  global  trading 
networks.  The  opportunity  is  that,  while 
spatial  concentration  remains  beneﬁ cial 
for  production,  increasing  specialization 
allows concentration and scale economies 
within subsectors in which even small play-
ers can carve out a niche. 

In 1999 India’s then-prime minister, Atal 
Behari Vajpayee, remarked on some of the 
same issues that have been discussed in this 
chapter:  “We  can  change  history  but  not 
geography. We can change our friends but 
not our neighbors.”72 Is he correct? On one 
level, certainly. Countries cannot just pack

way  individuals  can.  But  in  an  economic 
and  political  sense,  countries  can  change 
their neighborhoods. Japan and the United 
States overcame deep divisions of history 
and geography to become close neighbors 
by  developing  extensive  transport  links 
and increasing economic interdependence. 
Mexico and Turkey may be changing neigh-
borhoods by reorienting economic ties from 
their traditional cultural backyards to more 
prosperous  countries  in  another  part  of 
their neighborhood. European integration 
ended centuries of division and war. Since 
December 2007, travel from the Portuguese 
Algarve to Estonia is possible without once 
showing identiﬁ cation.

Many  world  regions  continue  to  face 
the impacts of signiﬁ cant division. But this 
Report shows that countries can improve 
their economic fortunes by changing their 
neighborhoods  virtually  and  practically. 
For  this,  they  must  do  two  things.  First, 
they  must  overcome  the  limitations  and 
barriers of geography by developing close 
trade and transport links with markets and 
sources of investment in rich and emerging 
regions of the world (see chapter 6). And 
second, they need to seek strength in num-
bers by “thinning” their borders and inte-
grating their economies with their physical 
neighborhood (see chapter 9).

Overcoming Division in Western Europe

The day will come when you France, you Russia, you Germany, all you nations of the continent, without losing your distinct quali-
ties and your glorious individuality, you will merge into a superior unit, and you will constitute European fraternity. 

—Victor Hugo, from a speech at the 1849 International Peace Congress

Victor Hugo was laughed at when 

he  said  this,  as  were  several  of 
his  predecessors  who  proposed 
European integration. It took the catas-
trophe of two world wars to get people 
to  take  the  idea  seriously  and  make 
policy makers ready for radical change. 
The scale of devastation and misery is 
the key to understanding the drive for 
integration:  on  top  of  the  horrifying 
death  toll,  the  war  caused  enormous 
economic  damage.  The  war  cost  Ger-
many  and  Italy  four  or  more  decades 
of growth and put Austrian and French 
gross  domestic  products  (GDPs)  back 
to levels of the nineteenth century.1

Overcoming  division  and  its  dra-
matic consequences was the objective 
of European leaders after World War 

II.  Destructive  nationalism—and  its 
economic  dimension,  protection-
ism—were  indeed  partly  blamed  for 
the disaster. Economic integration was 
thus  viewed  as  the  best  way  to  avoid 
another  war.  That  it  should  come 
through  peaceful  means  and  with 
the  main  objective  of  maintaining 
peace  was—and  remains—a  unique 
endeavor.  In  this  respect,  European 
integration  is  a  clear  success.  But  it 
was not clear in the 1940s and 1950s 
that this vision of “Peace through Inte-
gration”  would  succeed,  particularly 
because it came at the same time as the 
Cold War’s division between the East 
and the West.

Under  American  pressure,  13 
European  countries  created  the 

Organization  for  European  Eco-
nomic  Cooperation  (OEEC)  in  1948 
to  implement  the  Marshall  Plan.  Its 
mandate was to reduce trade barriers, 
particularly quota restrictions. Europe 
in the early postwar years was a tariff- 
and  quota-ridden  economy.  Remov-
ing  trade  barriers  fostered  the  rapid 
growth  of  trade.  Between  1950  and 
1958, manufacturing exports grew by 
almost 20 percent a year in West Ger-
many, 9.2 percent in Italy, and 3.8 per-
cent  in  France.  Additionally,  average 
annual GDP growth was 7.8 percent in 
West Germany, 5 percent in Italy, and 
4.4  percent  in  France.  Correlation  is 
not causality, and reconstruction was 
a  strong  engine  of  growth.  But  the 
rapid  growth  as  European  trade  was

liberalized  was  changing  the  minds 
of European policy makers. European 
integration  was  not  just  a  political 
project—it also made economic sense.
The European Coal and Steel Com-
munity  (ECSC)  was  launched  by 
France and Germany, who invited other 
nations to place these two sectors under 
its  supranational  authority.  The  proj-
ect  was  both  political  and  economic 
because  it  applied  a  supranationality 
onto two sectors that were considered 
strategic  for  economic  and  military 

reasons.  Belgium,  Italy,  Luxembourg, 
and the Netherlands joined the project 
in  1951,  and  these  six  would  become 
the  driving  force  behind  European 
integration (see map G2.1). The ECSC 
showed that economic cooperation was 
more feasible than political or military 
integration. 

The Treaty of Rome in 1957 created 
the  six  nations  of  the  European  Eco-
nomic  Community  (EEC).  The  move 
committed  the  six  to  unprecedented 
economic integration. Not only would

a  custom  union  remove  all  tariffs  for 
intra-EEC  trade  and  establish  a  com-
mon external tariff, but also a uniﬁ ed 
economic  area  would  promote  free 
labor mobility, integrated capital mar-
kets, free trade in services, and several 
common policies. This degree of eco-
nomic  integration  was  not  feasible 
without deep political integration. So, 
in  retrospect,  “using  economics  as  a 
Trojan  horse  for  political  integration 
worked like a charm.”2 As “guardians of 
the Treaty,” the Court and the European 
Commission would control those coun-
tries (especially France when de Gaulle 
returned to power) that came to reject 
the level of supranationality implied by 
the Treaty. From 1966 to 1986, however, 
the  deep  integration  promised  by  the 
Rome Treaty stalled (see ﬁ gure G2.1). 
Europeans began to erect barriers that 
took the form of technical regulations 
and standards, fragmenting markets—a 
classic reaction by lobbying industries 
to defend their rents.

The  Single  European  Act  (1986) 
relaunched the process of deepening eco-
nomic  integration—all  the  more  stun-
ning given the slow disintegration during 
the  1970s.  Emphasizing  the  mobility 
of capital, the Single Act was also partly 
responsible  for  the  birth  of  the  Euro-
pean  Monetary  Union  (EMU).  Indeed, 
the ﬁ xed exchange rate of the European 
Monetary  System  implied,  with  free 
capital  mobility,  the  loss  of  monetary 
sovereignty.  This  made  the  EMU  more 
politically  palatable  for  countries  com-
mitted to ﬁ xed exchange rates.

Overcoming  division  means  reduc-
ing  the  impact  of  borders  on  trade 
ﬂ ows. Has this been so in the European 
Union  (EU)?  One  way  to  answer  the 
question  is  to  compare  the  volume  of 
trade  within  borders  with  the  volume 
of bilateral trade between countries. The 
ratio  of  the  two  is  the “border  effect.” 
Fontagné,  Mayer,  and  Zignago  (2005) 
do  this  for  the  EU-9,  the  six  founders 
plus Denmark, Ireland, and the United 
Kingdom. The border effect for reported 
intra-EU  trade  fell  from  around  24  in 
the late 1970s to 13 in the late 1990s—a

substantial increase in integration (see 
ﬁ gure  G2.2)  unmatched  in  the  world. 
The border effect between the EU-9 and 
the United States, while decreasing fast 
during the period, remains more than 
twice that within the EU. Borders in the 
EU have become thinner, but they have 
not disappeared.

The  European  regional  integration 
process has spread. As the EU deepened 
and  enlarged,  the  cost  of  discrimina-
tory treatment (the natural implication 
of any regional integration process) for 
outsiders increased, creating a “domino 
dynamic  of  regionalism.”3  Even  Euro-
pean  countries  that  most  valued  their 

sovereignty  applied  for  membership. 
That the EU with its unmatched supra-
nationality  remains  so  attractive  for 
outsiders  is  evidence  of  an  enduring 
success.
