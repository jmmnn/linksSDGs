Preface

v

Since its creation in 1919, the ILO has been supporting countries to develop and im-

plement social security systems for all. There has been tremendous progress since 
then. At the outset, some 40 countries were starting to build such schemes; today, all 
countries in the world have a social security system. 

What is more, social protection coverage and benefits continue to expand, as re-
flected in the groundbreaking ILO Recommendation concerning National Floors of 
Social Protection (No. 202), adopted in 2012. The Recommendation bears witness to 
the joint commitment of governments, employers and workers to building nationally 
defined social protection floors which guarantee at least a basic level of social security 
to all, encompassing access to health care and income security throughout people’s lives 
and ensuring their dignity and rights. While social protection floors are essential, the 
Recommendation does not stop there: it also sets out detailed guidance on building 
comprehensive social protection systems.

Two years after the adoption of the Recommendation, this World Social Protection 
Report offers a comprehensive body of evidence both on the impressive progress made 
over the last few years and on the remaining gaps that need to be filled. Based on a life-
cycle approach, the report provides an overview of the current organization of social 
protection systems, coverage, benefits and expenditures. With its global scope and 
valuable statistical annexes, it is an essential reference for anyone interested in social 
protection.

In recent years, the ILO has provided technical assistance on social protection to no 
fewer than 136 countries. And we are proud to continue our support all over the world, 
as more and more evidence shows that social protection systems play a key role in the 
functioning of modern societies and are an essential ingredient of integrated strategies 
for economic and social development. Furthermore, experience since 2008 shows that 
countries with adequate social protection systems were able to respond more quickly 
and effectively to the global crisis. 

Yet some 73 per cent of the world’s population continues to live without adequate 
social protection coverage. In other words, for the large majority of people the fun-
damental human right to social security is only partially realized or not at all. In 
2014, it is clear that the global community needs to make greater efforts in realiz-
ing this right. With this in view, it is opportune to recall the many countries that 

historically have built sound economies at the same time as decent societies with 
social protection. 

Still grappling with the economic repercussions of the global financial crisis, the 
world is faced with a deep social crisis which is also a crisis of social justice. Fiscal con-
solidation and adjustment measures threaten household living standards in a signifi-
cant number of countries. Despite progress made in reducing levels of extreme poverty 
in some parts of the world, high levels of poverty and vulnerability persist; what is 
more, poverty is actually increasing in many high-income countries. In addition, high 
and still rising levels of inequality in both advanced and developing economies are 
widely acknowledged as cause for great concern. 

Social protection measures are essential elements of a policy response that can ad-
dress those challenges. They not only support the realization of the universal human 
right to social security, but are both a social and an economic necessity. Well-designed 
social protection systems support incomes and domestic consumption, build human 
capital and increase productivity. The bold efforts in extending social protection in 
many developing countries, from Brazil to China, from Ecuador to Mozambique, have 
underlined its key role in reducing poverty and vulnerability, redressing inequality and 
boosting inclusive growth.

This is an issue that the international community should embrace as a priority in 
the post-2015 development agenda. Social protection can ensure that all people have 
the security of knowing that if they lose their job or fall ill, and also when they grow 
old, they will not face the risk of poverty and insecurity. Our modern society can afford 
to provide universal social protection everywhere.

I hope that this report will be a useful tool for practitioners, and provide the basis 

for better informed policy-making.

World Social Protection Report 2014/15 
Executive summary

Social protection policies play a critical role in real-

izing the human right to social security for all, re-
ducing poverty and inequality, and supporting inclusive 
growth – by boosting human capital and productivity, 
supporting domestic demand and facilitating structural 
transformation of national economies. This ILO flag-
ship report: (i) provides a global overview of the or-
ganization of social protection systems, their coverage 
and benefits, as well as public expenditures on social 
security; (ii) following a life-cycle approach, presents 
social protection for children, for women and men of 
working age, and for older persons; (iii) analyses trends 
and recent policies, e.g. negative impacts of fiscal con-
solidation and adjustment measures; and (iv) calls for 
the expansion of social protection in pursuit of crisis re-
covery, inclusive development and social justice. 

While the need for social protection is widely recog-
nized, the fundamental human right to social security 
remains unfulfilled for the large majority of the world’s 
population. Only 27 per cent of the global population 
enjoy access to comprehensive social security systems, 
whereas 73 per cent are covered partially or not at all. 

The lack of access to social protection constitutes 
a major obstacle to economic and social development. 
Inadequate or absent social protection coverage is as-
sociated with high and persistent levels of poverty and 
economic insecurity, growing levels of inequality, in-
sufficient investments in human capital and human 
capabilities, and weak aggregate demand in a time of 
recession and slow growth. 

The strong positive impacts of social protection 
have brought social protection to the forefront of the 

xxi

development agenda. Social protection is a key element 
of national strategies to promote human development, 
political stability and inclusive growth. The ILO Social 
Protection Floors Recommendation, 2012 (No. 202), 
reflects a consensus on the extension of social security 
reached  among  governments  and  employers’  and 
workers’ organizations from 185 countries at all levels of 
development. Further, the roll-out of social protection 
floors is endorsed by the G20 and the United Nations. 
However, while there has been a global trend to-
wards the extension of social protection, particularly 
in middle-income countries, the effectiveness of social 
security systems in a number of countries is at risk as a 
result of fiscal consolidation and adjustment measures. 
These trends are presented in the different chapters of 
the report, following a life-cycle approach.

Social protection for children  
and families: A right unfulfilled 

Social protection policies are an essential element of 
realizing children’s rights, ensuring their well-being, 
breaking the vicious cycle of poverty and vulnerabil-
ity, and helping all children realize their full potential. 
 Despite a large expansion of schemes, existing social 
protection policies do not sufficiently address the 
income security needs of children and families, particu-
larly in low- and middle-income countries with large 
child populations. About 18,000 children die every day, 
mainly from preventable causes: many of these deaths 
could be averted through adequate social protection. 

xxii

Social protection also has a key role in preventing 
child labour by reducing economic vulnerability of 
families, enabling children to go to school and protect-
ing them from exploitation.

More efforts are needed to step up measures to ensure 
income security for children and families. Many chil-
dren do not receive the essential cash transfers that could 
make a real difference, in terms of nutrition, health, edu-
cation and care services, to their chances of realizing 
their full potential. Specific child and family benefit 
programmes rooted in legislation exist in 108 countries, 
yet often cover only small groups of the population. In 
75 countries, no such programmes are available at all. 

On average, governments allocate 0.4 per cent of 
GDP to child and family benefits, ranging from 2.2 per 
cent in Western Europe to 0.2 per cent in Africa, 
and in Asia and the Pacific. Underinvestment in chil-
dren jeopardizes their rights and their future, as well 
as the economic and social development prospects of 
the countries in which they live.

Fiscal consolidation and adjustment measures in 
higher-income economies threaten progress on income 
security for children and their families. Child poverty 
increased in 19 of the 28 countries of the European 
Union between 2007 and 2012.

Social protection in working age:  
The quest for income security

Social protection plays a key role for women and men 
of working age by stabilizing their incomes in the event 
of unemployment, employment injury, disability, sick-
ness and maternity, and by ensuring that they have at 
least a basic level of income security. While the labour 
market serves as the primary source of income security 
during working life, social protection plays a major role 
in smoothing incomes and aggregate demand, thereby 
facilitating structural change within economies.

Worldwide, 2.3 per cent of GDP is allocated to 
social protection expenditure for women and men in 
ensuring income security during working age; region-
ally, levels vary widely, ranging from 0.5 per cent in 
Africa to 5.9 per cent in Western Europe.

Unemployment protection

Where they exist, unemployment benefit schemes play 
a key role in providing income security to workers and 
their families in the event of temporary unemployment, 

contributing thereby to preventing poverty; supporting 
structural change in the economy; providing safeguards 
against informalization; and, in the event of a crisis, 
stabilizing aggregate demand, helping the economy to 
recover more quickly. 

However, only 28 per cent of the labour force world-
wide is potentially eligible for benefits (contributory 
or non-contributory) under existing legislation should 
they become unemployed. Within this overall figure, 
regional differences are considerable: 80 per cent of the 
labour force is so covered in Europe, 38 per cent in Latin 
 America, 21 per cent in the Middle East, 17 per cent in 
the Asia and Pacific region, and 8 per cent in Africa. 
Only 12 per cent of unemployed workers worldwide 
 actually receive unemployment benefits, and again re-
gional differences are large, with effective coverage ran-
ging from 64 per cent of unemployed workers in Western 
Europe to just over 7 per cent in the Asia and Pacific 
region, 5 per cent in Latin America and the Caribbean, 
and less than 3 per cent in the Middle East and Africa. 
A number of emerging economies have introduced 
unemployment benefit schemes, such as Bahrain or 
Viet Nam, as a means to ensure income security for 
unemployed workers and facilitate their search for jobs 
matching their skills in the formal economy. India’s 
employment guarantee scheme (Mahatma Gandhi Na-
tional Employment Guarantee Scheme) also provides a 
form of unemployment protection by guaranteeing 100 
days of public employment to poor rural households. 

Employment injury protection

In 2013, shaken by the Rana Plaza tragedy in Bangla-
desh, the world became aware that social protection in 
case of employment injury is essential to protect workers 
and their families from the financial consequences of ac-
cidents at work and to facilitate their rehabilitation. At 
present, however, only 33.9 per cent of the global labour 
force is covered by law for employment injury through 
mandatory social insurance. Even if voluntary social in-
surance coverage and employer liability provisions are 
included, only 39.4 per cent of the labour force is cov-
ered by law. In practice, actual access to employment 
injury protection is even lower, largely owing to incom-
plete enforcement of the legislation in many countries.
The low coverage of employment injury compensa-
tion in many low- and middle-income countries points to 
an urgent need to enhance working conditions in respect 
of occupational safety and health, as well as improving 
employment injury coverage for all workers, including 

World Social Protection Report 2014/15Executive summary

improve income security and access to maternal and 
child health care for pregnant women and new moth-
ers, particularly for women living in poverty. However, 
significant gaps remain.

Ensuring effective access to quality maternal health 
care is of particular importance, especially in countries 
where the informal economy accounts for a large pro-
portion of employment.

Old-age pensions: A state responsibility 

The right to income security in old age, as grounded 
in human rights instruments and international labour 
standards, includes the right to an adequate pension. 
However, nearly half (48 per cent) of all people over 
pensionable age do not receive a pension. For many of 
those who do receive a pension, pension levels are not 
adequate. As a result, the majority of the world’s older 
women and men have no income security, have no right 
to retire and have to continue working as long as they 
can – often badly paid and in precarious conditions. 
Under existing laws and regulations, only 42 per cent of 
people of working age today can expect to receive social 
security pensions in the future, and effective coverage is 
expected to be even lower. This gap will have to be filled 
also by an expansion of non-contributory provisions. 

In recent years, many middle- and low-income coun-
tries  have  made  efforts  to  expand  the  coverage  of 
contributory pension schemes and to establish non-
contributory pensions so as to guarantee at least basic 
income security in old age to all. 

At the same time, countries undertaking fiscal con-
solidation are reforming their pension systems to make 
cost savings, by such means as raising the retirement 
age, reducing benefits and increasing contribution rates. 
These adjustments are reducing state responsibility for 
guaranteeing income security in old age and shifting 
large parts of the economic risks associated with pen-
sion provision on to individuals, thereby undermining 
the adequacy of pension systems and reducing their abil-
ity to prevent poverty in old age. Future pensioners will 
receive lower pensions in at least 14 countries of Europe.
It is important to note that a number of countries 
are reversing the earlier privatizations of pension sys-
tems, implemented in the 1980s and 1990s. Argen-
tina, the Plurinational State of Bolivia, Chile, Hungary, 
 Kazakhstan and Poland either have renationalized or 
are renationalizing their pension systems to improve 
old-age income security.

those in the informal economy. As more countries move 
from employer liability as the basis for employment 
injury protection to a mechanism based on social insur-
ance, levels of protection for workers are likely to im-
prove – but only if new laws are effectively enforced. 

Disability benefits

Social protection plays a key role in meeting the spe-
cific needs of persons with disabilities with regard to 
income security, access to health care and social inclu-
sion. Effective measures to support persons with dis-
abilities in finding and retaining quality employment 
are a key element of non-discriminatory and inclusive 
policies that help to realize their rights and aspirations 
as productive members of society. 

Complementing contributory schemes, non-con-
tributory disability benefits play a key role in protecting 
those persons with disabilities who have not (yet) earned 
entitlements to contributory schemes. Only 87 coun-
tries offer such non-contributory benefits anchored in 
national legislation, which would provide at least a min-
imum level of income security for those disabled from 
birth or before working age, and those who for any reason 
have not had the opportunity to contribute to social 
insurance for long enough to be eligible for benefits. 

Maternity protection

Effective maternity protection ensures income security 
for pregnant women and mothers of newborn children 
and their families, and also effective access to qual-
ity maternal health care. It also promotes equality in 
employment and occupation.

Worldwide, less than 40 per cent of women in 
employment are covered by law under mandatory ma-
ternity cash benefit schemes; 57 per cent if voluntary 
coverage (mainly for women in self-employment) is 
included. Due to the ineffective enforcement and im-
plementation of the law in some regions (Asia and 
the Pacific, Latin America and Africa in particular), 
effective  coverage  is  even  lower:  only  28  per  cent 
of women in employment worldwide are protected 
through maternity cash benefits which provide some 
income security in during the final stages of pregnancy 
and after childbirth; the absence of income security 
forces many women to return to work prematurely.

An increasing number of countries are using non-
contributory maternity cash benefits as a means to 

Towards universal coverage in health

Expanding social protection: Key to crisis 
recovery and inclusive development

xxiv

The urgency of striving for universal coverage in health 
is illustrated by the fact more than 90 per cent of the 
population living in low-income countries remains 
without any right to coverage in health. Globally, 
39 per cent of the population is lacking such coverage. 
As a result, about 40 per cent of all global health ex-
penditure is shouldered directly by the sick. However, 
even people who are legally covered experience limited 
health benefits, high out-of-pocket payments and a lack 
of the health workers needed to deliver services. In 
such circumstances, despite coverage, health care is fre-
quently neither available nor affordable, and the cost of 
accessing needed services can lead to poverty.

The ILO estimates that there is a global shortfall 
of 10.3 million health workers required to ensure that 
all in need receive quality health services. This gap, and 
the often close-to-poverty wages of health workers, are 
blocking progress towards universal health coverage.

Globally, 88 countries in several regions of the world 
have proved that it is possible to close the gaps in health 
coverage. Many of them began the process of reform at 
lower levels of national income and invested in times of 
economic crisis. Further, they have shown that coun-
tries can achieve high coverage rates and even univer-
sal coverage using either tax- or contribution-funded 
systems and schemes or a mix of both. However, coun-
tries undergoing fiscal consolidation have often initi-
ated health reforms to make cost savings, through such 
means as rationalizing the costs of public health facil-
ities, introducing patient co-payments and cutting wage 
bills for medical staff. These adjustment measures have 
sharpened inequities in access to health care and in-
creased exclusion by shifting the burden from the public 
purse to private households.

Investing  in  health  protection,  including  paid 
sick leave, yields returns. However, public expendi-
ture on health is at present too low to be sufficiently 
effective: the potential economic returns from in-
creased productivity and employment cannot be real-
ized while gaps in coverage persist. Closing these gaps 
would lead to the highest rates of return in the world’s 
poorest countries.

Greater joint efforts are necessary to work towards 
universal health coverage, and towards the associated 
goal of establishing social protection floors, as recently 
called for by the UN General Assembly.

The global financial and economic crisis has force-
fully underlined the importance of social security as a 
human right, and as an economic and social necessity, 
as set out in the ILO Social Protection Floors Recom-
mendation, 2012 (No. 202).

In the first phase of the crisis (2008–09), social 
protection played a strong role in the expansionary 
response. At least 48 high- and middle-income coun-
tries announced fiscal stimulus packages totalling 
US$2.4 trillion, of which approximately a quarter was 
invested in counter-cyclical social protection measures. 
In the second phase of the crisis (2010 onwards), 
governments embarked on fiscal consolidation and pre-
mature contraction of expenditure, despite an urgent 
need of public support among vulnerable populations. 
In 2014, the scope of public expenditure adjustment is 
expected to intensify significantly: according to IMF 
projections, 122 countries – of which 82 are develop-
ing countries – will be contracting expenditures in 
terms of GDP. Further, a fifth of countries are under-
going excessive fiscal contraction, defined as cutting 
public expenditures below pre-crisis levels. 

Contrary to public perception, fiscal consolida-
tion measures are not limited to Europe; many devel-
oping countries have adopted adjustment measures, 
including the elimination or reduction of food and 
fuel subsidies; cuts or caps on wages, including for 
health and social care workers; rationalizing and more 
narrowly targeting social protection benefits; and re-
forms of pension and health-care systems. Many gov-
ernments are also considering revenue-side measures, 
for example increasing consumption taxes such as 
VAT on basic products that are consumed by poor 
households. 

In developing countries, some of the proceeds of 
these adjustments, e.g. from the elimination of sub-
sidies, have been used to design narrowly targeted 
safety nets, as a compensatory mechanism to the poor-
est. However, given the large number of vulnerable 
low-income households in developing countries, more 
efforts are necessary to increase the fiscal space to meet 
the social protection needs of populations.

Of particular significance are the divergent trends 
in  richer  and  poorer  countries:  while  many  high-
income countries are contracting their social security 
systems, many developing countries are expanding them. 
High-income countries have reduced a range of 
social protection benefits and limited access to quality

public services. Together with persistent unemploy-
ment, lower wages and higher taxes, these measures 
have contributed to increases in poverty or social 
exclusion now affecting 123 million people in the 
 European Union, 24 per cent of its population, many 
of them children, women, older persons and persons 
with disabilities. Several European courts have found 
cuts unconstitutional. The cost of adjustment has been 
passed on to populations, who have been coping with 
fewer jobs and lower income for more than five years. 
Depressed household income levels are leading to 
lower domestic consumption and lower demand, slow-
ing down recovery. The achievements of the  European 
social model, which dramatically reduced poverty 
and promoted prosperity in the period following the 
Second World War, have been eroded by short-term 
adjustment reforms. 

Many middle-income countries are boldly expand-
ing their social protection systems, thereby contribut-
ing to their domestic demand-led growth strategies: this 
presents a powerful developmental lesson. China, for 
instance, has achieved nearly universal coverage of pen-
sions and increased wages; Brazil accelerated the expan-
sion of social protection coverage and minimum wages 

since 2009. Continued commitment is necessary to ad-
dress persistent inequalities. 

Some lower-income countries have extended social 
protection mainly through temporary safety nets with 
very low benefit levels. However, in many of these coun-
tries debates are under way on building social protec-
tion floors as part of comprehensive social protection 
systems. 

The case for social protection is compelling in our 
times. Social protection realizes the human right to 
social security and is a key element of sound economic 
policy. Social protection powerfully contributes to re-
ducing poverty, exclusion and inequality – while en-
hancing political stability and social cohesion. It also 
contributes to economic growth by supporting house-
hold income and thus domestic consumption; this is 
particularly important during this time of slow re-
covery and low global demand. Further, social pro-
tection enhances human capital and productivity, so 
it has become a critical policy for transformative na-
tional development. Social protection, specifically social 
protection floors, are essential for recovery, inclusive 
development and social justice, and must be part of the 
post-2015 development agenda.

KEY MESSAGES
 n While the need for social protection is widely recognized, the fundamental human 
right to social security remains unfulfilled for the large majority of the world’s 
population. Only 27 per cent of the global population enjoy access to comprehen-
sive social security systems, whereas 73 per cent are covered partially or not at all. 
 n The lack of access to social protection constitutes a major obstacle to economic 
and social development. Inadequate or absent social protection coverage is asso-
ciated with high and persistent levels of poverty and economic insecurity in some 
parts of the world, high and growing levels of inequality, insufficient investments 
in human capital and human capabilities, and weak automatic stabilizers of 
aggregate demand in the event of economic shocks.

 n Social protection policies contribute to fostering both economic and social devel-
opment in the short and the long term, by ensuring that people enjoy income 
security, have effective access to health care and other social services, and are 
empowered to take advantage of economic opportunities. Such policies play a 
key role in boosting domestic demand, supporting structural transformation of 
national economies, promoting decent work, and fostering inclusive and sustain-
able growth. 

 n National social protection floors and broader social security systems provide an 
enabling framework within which to reduce and prevent poverty, as well as to 
redress inequalities. They are key elements of national policies to promote human 
development, political stability and inclusive growth.

 n The ILO Social Protection Floors Recommendation, 2012 (No. 202), provides 
practical guidance for setting national social protection floors and building com-
prehensive social security systems. It reflects a consensus on the extension of 
social security reached among governments and employers’ and workers’ organ-
izations from 185 countries at all levels of development. 

 n While there has been a global trend towards the extension of social protection, 
particularly in middle-income countries, the effectiveness of social security sys-
tems in a number of high-income countries is at risk as a result of fiscal con-
solidation measures. These trends are presented in the different chapters of the 
report, following a life-cycle approach.

1.1   A right unfulfilled

While the need for social protection is widely rec-
ognized, the fundamental human right to social se-
curity remains unfulfilled for the large majority of the 
world’s population.1 Despite the impressive extension 
of social protection coverage over the past century, es-
pecially over the past decade, only a minority of the 
world’s population is effectively protected. According 
to ILO estimates, in 2012 only 27 per cent of the work-
ing-age population and their families across the globe 
had access to comprehensive social security systems. In 
other words, almost three-quarters, or 73 per cent, of 
the world’s population, about 5.2 billion people, do not 
enjoy access to comprehensive social protection. Many 
of those not sufficiently protected live in poverty, which 
is the case for half the population of middle- and low-
income countries (World Bank, 2014).2 Many of them, 
about 800 million people, are working poor (ILO, 
2014a), and many work in the informal economy.3

The lack of access to social protection constitutes 
a major obstacle to economic and social development 
(ILO, 2010a; ILO, 2011a; ILO, 2012a; UN, 2008; UN, 
2012b). In fact, the widespread lack of social protection 
coverage is associated with high and persistent levels of 
poverty and economic insecurity in some parts of the 
world (e.g. World Bank, 2014), high and growing levels 
of inequality (UNDP, 2014; UN, 2013d; UNRISD, 
2010), insufficient investments in human capital and 
human capabilities, and weak automatic stabilizers 
of aggregate demand in the event of economic shocks 
(e.g. ADB, 2014).

Social protection policies contribute to fostering both 
economic and social development in the short and the 
long term, by ensuring that people enjoy income security, 

have effective access to health care and other social ser-
vices, and are empowered to take advantage of economic 
opportunities. They play a key role in boosting domestic 
demand, supporting structural transformation of na-
tional economies, promoting decent work, and fostering 
inclusive and sustainable growth (e.g. G20, 2011; G20, 
2012; ILO, 2012a; OECD, 2009a; World Bank, 2012). 
Social protection policies also accelerate progress to-
wards the Millennium Development Goals (UN, 2010a; 
UNICEF, 2010). Sustainable and equitable growth 
cannot be achieved in the absence of strong social pro-
tection policies which guarantee at least a basic level of 
social protection to all in need and progressively extend 
the scope and level of social security coverage.4 Such basic 
levels of social security should be guaranteed as part of 
national social protection floors, which constitute the 
fundamental elements of national social security systems.
Many countries have significantly extended their 
social security coverage during recent years and have 
stepped up their efforts to ensure that all in need 
benefit from at least basic protection, while continuing 
to develop their social security systems. In Brazil, Cabo 
Verde, China, Ghana, India, Mexico, Mozambique, 
South Africa and Thailand, for example, the gradual 
extension of social security coverage has had a signifi-
cant impact on the well-being of the population, and 
has contributed, in conjunction with economic, labour 
market and employment policies, to fostering economic 
and social development and inclusive growth.

On the other hand, in the aftermath of the global 
financial and economic crisis a number of govern-
ments have reduced public spending in areas including 
social security systems, resulting in limits on the cov-
erage or level of benefits. Fiscal consolidation5 meas-
ures have slowed progress towards the realization of the

1  There are varying definitions of the terms “social protection” and “social security”. In many contexts, as in this report, the two terms are 
used interchangeably. The ILO usually uses the term “social security”, with reference to the human right to social security set out in the 
Universal Declaration on Human Rights, 1948 (Art. 22), the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, 1966 
(Art. 9) and other UN human rights instruments. This term encompasses a broad variety of policy instruments, including social insurance, 
social assistance, universal benefits and other forms of cash transfers, as well as measures to ensure effective access to health care and other 
benefits in kind aiming at securing social protection. For more detail, see the glossary at the end of this report (Annex I), as well as ILO, 
2010a, pp. 13–17.
2  These World Bank estimates are based on a poverty line of US$2.50 PPP for 2010.
3  The informal economy is understood as the set of all economic activities by workers and economic units that are – in law or in 
practice – not covered or insufficiently covered by formal arrangements. Workers in the informal economy are usually covered insufficiently 
or not at all by social protection; indeed, the lack of social protection coverage is sometimes used as a criterion by which to identify informal 
employment. At the same time, extending social protection coverage to workers in the informal economy helps to address some of the risks 
that trap workers in informality (such as the lack of health coverage) and support transitions to formalization (ILO, 2013g; ILO, 2013h).
4  This recognition reflects an important policy paradigm shift in international development (Cichon and Hagemejer, 2007; Cichon, 2013). 
This can be seen in policy documents and academic studies, but also in the wide range of recent policy reforms in a growing number of 
developing countries.
5  In this report, fiscal consolidation refers to the wide array of adjustment measures adopted to reduce government deficits and debt 
accumulation. Fiscal consolidation policies are often referred to as austerity policies.

1.2   Building social protection systems: 

A historical overview, 1900–2012

Since the beginning of the twentieth century, sig-
nificant progress has been made in extending social 
security coverage and building comprehensive social 
security systems. From early steps taken in a number of 
pioneer countries, the scope of legal coverage,6 as meas-
ured by the number of areas covered by social protec-
tion programmes anchored in national legislation, was 
extended at an impressive pace to more countries and 
more areas (see figure 1.1).7 By 2012, the majority of 
countries had social security schemes established by 
law covering all or most areas, albeit in many cases only 
for a minority of their populations. This was the case 
in most European countries, large parts of the Amer-
icas, and increasingly also in Asia and the Pacific and in 
North Africa. Significant progress has also been made 
in the Middle East and sub-Saharan Africa.

Countries tend to extend their national social se-
curity systems in a sequence of steps, depending on 

their national circumstances and priorities. In many 
cases, when building social security systems, countries 
first addressed the area of employment injury, then in-
troduced old-age pensions, disability and survivors’ 
benefits, followed by sickness, health and maternity 
coverage. Benefits for children and families, and un-
employment benefits, typically came last (see figure 1.2). 
However, the extension of legal coverage does not in 
itself ensure either the effective coverage of the popu-
lation or improvements in the quality and level of bene-
fits. In fact, the extension of effective coverage has 
significantly lagged behind that of legal coverage, due 
to problems in implementation and enforcement, a lack 
of policy coordination and weak institutional capacities 
for the effective delivery of benefits and services. It is 
therefore essential to monitor legal and effective cover-
age in parallel, as will be done throughout this report, 
as far as the available data allow.

In many countries, a number of programmes have 
emerged in recent years that provide some degree of 
protection but lack a legal foundation. These cannot be 
considered as offering the same quantity and extent of 
protection as programmes grounded in law, as they do 
not establish legal entitlements or enforceable rights. 
Still, they play an important role in improving the situ-
ation of those benefiting from them. Many govern-
ments recognize the importance of anchoring social

security programmes in a sound framework of national 
legislation, thereby clarifying individuals’ rights and 
obligations, enhancing the predictability and adequacy 
of benefits, strengthening institutional capacities pro-
moting transparency and accountability, providing 
safeguards against corruption and establishing a more 
stable and regular funding base. 

1.3   Fiscal consolidation:  

Setbacks 2010–15

The report also focuses on the setbacks resulting from 
fiscal adjustment processes initiated from 2010 on-
wards. In 2014, 122 countries are limiting their public 
expenditures in terms of GDP, at a time when popula-
tions are most in need. Fiscal consolidation measures 
have contributed to increases in poverty and social ex-
clusion in several high-income countries, adding to 
the effects of persistent unemployment, lower wages 
and higher taxes. The resulting depressed household 
income levels are jeopardizing domestic consumption 
and demand, and slowing down recovery. 

Contrary to public perception, fiscal consolidation 
policies have been applied not only in European coun-
tries, but also in some middle- and low-income countries, 
which are currently grappling with dwindling economic 
growth rates (IMF, 2013a). The combination of food 
and fuel price increases, followed by the global economic 
slowdown, jobless recovery and now cutbacks in public 
expenditure, have taken a toll on families in developing 
countries. The crucial importance of governments’ com-
mitment to continuing investments in social protection, 
in order to ensure inclusive growth and limit the harm-
ful effects of persistent poverty and growing inequality, 
is highlighted in the different chapters of the report.

1.4   The way forward: Building  

national social protection floors  
and social security systems

With the adoption of the ILO’s Social Protection 
Floors Recommendation, 2012 (No. 202), the world 
has taken a significant step forward in the realization 

of the human right to social security.8 This Recommen-
dation is the first international legal instrument that 
explicitly recognizes the triple role of social security as 
a universal human right and an economic and social ne-
cessity. It recognizes the importance of national social 
protection floors, which provide basic social security 
guarantees to all with the aim of ensuring effective 
access to at least essential health care and a basic level of 
income security as a matter of priority, as the indispens-
able foundation for more comprehensive national social 
security systems (ILO, 2012a). The ILO’s two-dimen-
sional extension strategy provides clear guidance on the 
future development of social security in the ILO’s 185 
member States towards the achievement of universal 
protection of the population by ensuring at least basic 
levels of income security and access to essential health 
care (national social protection floors: horizontal di-
mension) and progressively ensuring wider scope and 
higher levels of protection, guided by ILO social se-
curity standards (vertical dimension).9

The importance of building national social pro-
tection floors has also been recognized by the United 
Nations and the wider international development com-
munity. Following the call for the establishment of 
social protection floors by the UN Chief Executives 
Board in 2009 (UN, 2009a; Social Protection Floor 
Advisory Group, 2011), the role of social protection in 
general, and social protection floors in particular, for 
economic and social development has been acknow-
ledged in a number of international, regional and multi-
national forums, including the United Nations (e.g. 
UN, 2010b; UN, 2012a) and the G20 (G20, 2009; 
G20, 2011; G20, 2012).

The emerging global consensus on social protection 
floors has been accompanied by a stronger emphasis 
on coherent and effective social protection systems in 
the strategic frameworks of other major international 
and multilateral organizations (FAO, 2012; OECD, 
2009a; UNICEF, 2012; WHO, 2010; World Bank, 
2012; European Commission, 2011a; European Com-
mission, 2012a). Along with the ILO, they emphasize 
the need for a systemic approach to social protection, 
aiming at building inclusive and sustainable social pro-
tection systems that are closely coordinated with other 
social and economic policies. Together with other 

8  Recommendation No. 202 was adopted almost unanimously (one abstention) by governments and employers’ and workers’ representatives 
of the ILO’s member States at the 101st Session of the International Labour Conference. The core elements of this Recommendation, 
and wider perspectives, were reflected in the Resolution and conclusions concerning the recurrent discussion on social protection (social 
security), adopted at the previous session of the International Labour Conference in 2011. Both documents are included in ILO, 2012a.
9  This strategy was adopted by the International Labour Conference in 2011 (ILO, 2012a).

Box 1.1  The ILO’s normative framework for the extension of social security

Since its establishment in 1919, the ILO has played a major role developing an internationally defined 
normative framework guiding the establishment, development and maintenance of social security systems 
across the world, and has become the world’s leading point of reference for efforts to this end. Elaborated 
and adopted by the Organization’s tripartite constituents, governments, employers’ and workers’ represen-
tatives of all ILO member States, and stemming from the Organization’s mandate, the Conventions and 
Recommendations that compose this framework are unique: they establish standards that States set for 
themselves, building on good practices and innovative ways of providing enhanced and extended social 
protection in countries from all regions of the world. At the same time, they are built on the notion that 
there is no single perfect model for social security; on the contrary, it is for each society to develop the best 
means of guaranteeing the protection required. Accordingly, they offer a range of options and flexible routes 
for their application, which can be achieved through a combination of contributory and non-contributory 
benefits, general and occupational schemes, compulsory and voluntary insurance, and different methods 
for the administration of benefits, all directed at ensuring an overall level of protection which best responds 
to each country’s needs. 

Complementing and giving specific form to the provisions regarding the right to social security in inter-
national human rights instruments, the ILO’s normative social security framework consists of eight up-
to-date Conventions and Recommendations. The most prominent instruments are the Social Security 
(Minimum Standards) Convention, 1952 (No. 102), and the Social Protection Floors Recommendation, 2012 
(No. 202).1

The long-standing Convention No. 102 regroups the nine classical social security contingencies (medical 
care, sickness, unemployment, old age, employment injury, family responsibilities, maternity, invalidity, 
survivorship) into a single comprehensive and legally binding instrument. 

The recent Recommendation No. 202 provides guidance on closing social security gaps and achieving 
universal coverage through the establishment and maintenance of comprehensive social security systems. 
It calls upon States to achieve universal coverage with at least minimum levels of protection through the 
implementation of social protection floors as a matter of priority; and to progressively ensure higher levels 
of protection. National social protection floors should comprise basic social security guarantees that ensure 
effective access to essential health care and basic income security at a level that allows people to live in 
dignity throughout the life cycle These should include at least: 
•  access to essential health care, including maternity care;
•  basic income security for children;
•  basic income security for persons of working age who are unable to earn sufficient income, in particular 

in cases of sickness, unemployment, maternity and disability; 

•  basic income security for older persons.

Complementing existing standards, Recommendation No. 202 sets forth an integrated and coherent ap-
proach to social protection across the life cycle, underscores the principle of universality of protection 
through nationally defined social protection floors, and embodies a commitment to their progressive re-
alization in terms of benefits and people covered. It thereby aims at ensuring that all members of society 
enjoy at least a basic level of social security throughout their lives, ensuring their health and dignity. Poverty, 
vulnerability and social exclusion are established as priority areas of attention, with the clear objective of re-
ducing poverty as soon as possible. The Recommendation calls for systems that are country-led, are aligned 
to national circumstances, are reviewed in the light of population needs, and include the participation of all 
stakeholders. In an innovative way, it contains guidance on monitoring to help countries assess their progress 
in moving towards enhanced protection and improve the performance of national social security systems.

1  Convention No. 102 has been ratified to date by 50 countries, most recently by Brazil (2009), Bulgaria (2008), Honduras 
(2012), Jordan (2014), Romania (2009) and Uruguay (2010), and provides guidance for all 185 ILO member States. ILO 
Recommendations are not open for ratification.

opment and continuous evolution of national social

1.5   Objective and structure of the report

Two years after the adoption of Recommendation 
No. 202, this report takes stock of the state of social 
security coverage around the world, particularly with 
regard to the building of national social protection 
floors and comprehensive social security systems. This 
report is the second in a series of reports10 that pro-
vide an assessment of social security coverage around 
the world, highlight progress made in enhancing pro-
tection, identify remaining coverage gaps, and discuss 
major challenges for further progress in realizing the 
right to social security for all. 

Reflecting the approach set out in Recommenda-
tion No. 202, this report is structured in a sequence 
of chapters following the life cycle, so that relevant 
clusters of contributory or non-contributory social 
security schemes and programmes are addressed to-
gether.11 Chapters 2–4 focus on social protection bene-
fits that enhance income security throughout the life 
cycle, gathered into three major clusters: Chapter 2 
focuses on social protection benefits for children and 
families, including child and family benefits; Chap-
ter 3 addresses various elements of income security for 
people of working age, addressing specifically benefits 
in case of unemployment (section 3.2), employment 
injury (section 3.3), disability (section 3.4) and ma-
ternity (section 3.5). Chapter 4 addresses income se-
curity in old age, with a particular focus on old-age 
pensions.12 Chapter 5 is devoted to achieving universal 
coverage in health throughout the life cycle, including 
medical care and sickness benefits. Chapter 6 is devoted 
to issues of social security financing and expenditure, 

and reflects specifically on the divergent trends of ex-
pansion and contraction, and their implications for 
future policy-making in social security and the post-
2015 development agenda. Throughout the report, ref-
erence is repeatedly made to the rights underpinning 
social security systems, which remain as valid and as 
important as ever.

Annex I includes a short glossary of key terms used 
in this report, and Annex II summarizes the concepts 
and measurement of social security coverage applied. 
Annex III includes summary tables regarding some of 
the main minimum requirements set out in ILO social 
security standards. Annex IV includes the statistical 
tables.

1.6   Building the knowledge base  
on social protection statistics

Conceived as a tool to facilitate monitoring of the state 
of social protection in the world, the World Social Pro-
tection Report offers in its successive editions an exten-
sive statistical resource in relation to social protection, 
including a set of detailed tables in the Statistical 
Annex (Annex IV) of this report, and more on a dedi-
cated website.13 This database draws to a large extent 
on the ILO Social Security Inquiry database, which 
provides in-depth country-level statistics on various 
dimensions of social security systems, including key 
indicators.14

Having published such data since the 1950s in 
various forms, the ILO maintains its databases in col-
laboration, as far as possible on a consistent basis, with 
a number of other international and regional actors, 
notably the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the Stat-
istical Office of the European Commission (Eurostat), 
the Economic Commission for Latin America and the 
Caribbean (ECLAC) and other regional commissions 
of the United Nations, the International Social Security 
Association (ISSA), the Organisation for Economic

10  The first report in the series was published as the World Social Security Report in 2010 (ILO, 2010a). This report is published as the 
World Social Protection Report in order to reflect the greater interest in social protection issues in many parts of the world, and at the 
international level.
11  In doing so, both the horizontal and vertical dimensions of the extension of social security (ILO, 2012a) are addressed in an integrated 
way in each chapter.
12  General social assistance is not treated under a separate heading but is referred to throughout the report.
13  The Statistical Annex (Annex IV) of this report includes two sets of tables. Tables AIV.A1–AIV.A12 provide key demographic, 
economic and social indicators and are available online; tables AIV.B1–AIV.B13, which are more specifically concerned with social 
protection, are included also in the printed version. All material is available at http://www.social-protection.org/gimi/gess/ShowTheme.

Co-operation and Development (OECD), the World 
Bank and the World Health Organization (WHO). 
The ILO Social Security Inquiry database is linked to 
various other databases on social protection, includ-
ing the Eurostat European System of Integrated Social 
Protection Statistics database (ESPROSS), the OECD 
Social Expenditure database (SOCX), the World Bank 
pensions and ASPIRE databases, the ISSA’s Social Se-
curity Observatory, the ADB Social Protection Index 
database (SPI), the WHO’s Global Health Observatory 
and National Health Accounts, and ECLAC’s data-
bases.15 The ILO Social Security Inquiry database also 
draws on national official reports and other sources, 

which usually are largely based on administrative data; 
and on survey data from a range of sources including 
national household income and expenditure surveys, 
labour force surveys, and demographic and health sur-
veys, to the extent that these include variables on social 
protection. This report is also intended as a contribu-
tion to the joint efforts at national and international 
level16 to ensure the availability of high-quality social 
security statistics, not least to support ILO member 
States in monitoring and reviewing their social protec-
tion floors and social security systems, and to ensure 
their effectiveness and efficiency in meeting the social 
protection needs of their populations.

15  A list of databases used for the production of this report is provided at the end of the bibliography.
16  Efforts are under way in the framework of the Social Protection Inter-Agency Coordination Board (SPIAC-B) to strengthen 
collaboration between international agencies in the field of social protection statistics and to develop integrated guidance material for 
national actors (ILO et al., 2013; Bonnet and Tessier, 2013). This work aims at carrying further the international community’s earlier efforts 
to agree on a set of core indicators in the field of social security statistics, as set out in the “Resolution concerning the development of social 
security statistics”, adopted by the International Conference of Labour Statisticians in 1957, which continues to provide relevant guidance 
for the further development of social security statistics at the national level.

KEY MESSAGES
 n Social protection policies are an essential element of realizing chil-
dren’s rights, ensuring their well-being, breaking the vicious cycle 
of poverty and vulnerability, and helping all children realize their 
full potential. 

 n Despite a large expansion of schemes, existing social protection 
policies do not sufficiently address the income security needs of 
children and families, particularly in low- and middle-income coun-
tries with large child populations. About 18,000 children die every 
day, mainly from preventable causes. Many of these deaths could 
be prevented through adequate social protection.

 n More efforts are needed to step up measures to ensure income se-
curity for children and families, including child and family benefits. 
Specific child and family benefit programmes rooted in legislation 
exist in 108 countries, yet often cover only small groups of the popu-
lation. In 75 countries, no such programmes are available at all. 

 n On average, governments allocate 0.4 per cent of GDP to child and 
family benefits, ranging from 2.2 per cent in Western Europe to 
0.2 per cent in Africa, and in Asia and the Pacific. Underinvest-
ment in children jeopardizes their rights and their future, as well as 
the economic and social development prospects of the countries in 
which they live.

 n Fiscal  consolidation  and  adjustment  measures  in  higher-income 
economies threaten progress on income security for children and 
their families. Child poverty increased in 19 of the 28 countries of 
the European Union between 2007 and 2012.

 n Social protection is a human right, further supported by the UN Con-
vention on the Rights of the Child, 1989, and yet many children do 
not receive the essential cash transfers that could make a real dif-
ference, in terms of nutrition, health, education and care services, 
to their chances of realizing their full potential. Social protection also 
has a key – yet often neglected – role in preventing child labour.

10

2.1   The role of social protection in ensuring 

children’s well-being

Social protection is essential in preventing and redu-
cing poverty for children and families, in addressing in-
equalities and in realizing children’s rights. 

Despite recent progress in many parts of the world, 
too many children live in poverty and are deprived 
of  their  most  elementary  rights  (UNICEF,  2012; 
UNICEF, 2014). In, fact, in most parts of the world, 
children and families with children are at greater risk 
of poverty than other groups of the population, with 
respect to both monetary and other forms of poverty. 

The consequences of poverty are very significant 
for children. Children experience poverty differently 
from adults; they have specific and different needs. 
While an adult may fall into poverty temporarily, a 
child who falls into poverty may be poor for a life-
time – rarely does a child get a second chance at an 
education or a healthy start in life. Even short periods 
of food deprivation can be detrimental to children’s 
long-term development. If children do not receive ad-
equate nutrition, they lag behind their peers in size 
and intellectual capacity, are more vulnerable to life-
threatening diseases, perform less well in school, and 
ultimately are less likely to be productive adults. Child 
poverty threatens not only the individual child, but is 
likely to be passed on to future generations, entrench-
ing and even exacerbating inequality in society (see, 
e.g. UNICEF, 2012; UNICEF, 2014; Minujin and 
Nandy, 2012; Ortiz, Moreira Daniels and Engilberts-
dóttir, 2012). Many of the 18,000 children under the 
age of five who die every day, mainly from prevent-
able causes, could be saved through adequate social 
protection  (UNICEF,  2014).  Where  children  are 
 deprived of a decent standard of living, access to qual-
ity health care (see Chapter 5), education and care, and 
where they suffer from social exclusion, their future is 
compromised. Where children are forced to engage in 
child labour, such exploitation takes a heavy toll on 
their physical and cognitive development, and on their 
future life chances (ILO, 2013a). Child poverty affects 
not only the well-being and aspirations of individual 
children, but also the wider communities, societies and 
economies in which they live. 

Child and family benefits, in cash and in kind, play 
a particularly important role in realizing children’s 
rights and addressing their needs, particularly for the 
most vulnerable members of society (see, e.g. UNICEF, 
2012; Sanfilippo, de Neubourg and Martorano, 2012; 
UNESCO, 2014). Evidence from many parts of the 

world demonstrates that social protection benefits have 
led to a marked improvement in the nutritional status 
of children (see ILO, 2010a; UNICEF, 2012; Save the 
Children, 2012a). Cash transfer programmes have also 
contributed to a significant increase in the utilization 
of pre- and post-natal health visits and in a reduction in 
the proportion of home-based births, thus enhancing 
maternal and child health. More generally, such pro-
grammes have been shown to increase the utilization 
of health services, again contributing to improvements 
in children’s health (e.g. Attanasio et al., 2005). Cash 
transfers for children and families, both conditional and 
non-conditional, have also contributed to significant in-
creases in children’s enrolment and attendance at school 
in different parts of the world, as well as, although with 
less conclusive evidence, improvements in education 
outcomes (e.g. additional years of schooling, impact on 
wages) (Fiszbein and Schady, 2009; Baird et al., 2013; 
UNICEF, 2012; ILO, 2010b; ILO, 2013a). Through 
these various channels, social protection benefits con-
tribute to enhancing children’s current and future well-
being, and their ability to seize economic and social 
opportunities in later life. Child and family benefits, to-
gether with other forms of benefits and services, are also 
an important means of responding to the special needs 
of children with disabilities (UNICEF, 2013), orphans 
and vulnerable children, children affected by violence 
and abuse, and other disadvantaged children (Save the 
Children, 2012b; Barrientos et al., 2013).

This chapter focuses in particular on the income se-
curity of children and families, which constitutes a key 
dimension of their well-being. Strengthening income 
security is therefore a key element of policies that aim 
at reducing and preventing child poverty, at breaking 
the intergenerational transmission of poverty, and at 
facilitating children’s access to nutrition, care, edu-
cation and health care. The ILO’s Social Protection 
Floors Recommendation, 2012 (No. 202), explicitly 
recognizes income security for children as one of the 
basic social security guarantees constituting a national 
social protection floor, based on an integrated approach 
that addresses the multiple dimensions of child well- 
being. This basic social security guarantee provides an 
effective framework for national policies (see box 2.1). 
The notion of income security is not limited to a suf-
ficient level of cash income, but encompasses income in 
kind, such as nutrition and access to services – indeed, 
the broad range of resources that is necessary to secure 
a decent standard of living and life in dignity for all 
children. Social services (e.g. care, education, health 
care) are essential in ensuring income security, as these 

World Social Protection Report 2014/152. Social protection for children and families

Box 2.1  International standards for child and family benefits

The UN legal framework on human rights contains a number of provisions spelling out various rights of chil-
dren that form part of their right to social protection. These comprise the right to social security, taking into 
consideration the resources and the circumstances of the child and persons having responsibility for their 
maintenance;1 the right to a standard of living adequate for their health and their well-being; and the right to 
special care and assistance.2 The ICESCR further requires States to give the widest possible protection and 
assistance to the family, particularly for the care and education of dependent children.3

ILO social security standards complement this framework and provide guidance to countries on how to 
give effect to the various rights that form part of the right of children to social protection. The ILO Social Se-
curity (Minimum Standards) Convention, 1952 (No. 102), Part VII, sets minimum standards for the provision 
of family (or child) benefits in the form of either a periodic cash benefit or benefits in kind (food, clothing, 
housing, holidays or domestic help) or a combination of both, allocated for the maintenance of children. The 
fundamental objective of family benefits should thus be to ensure the welfare of children and the economic 
stability of their families. 

As specified by the ILO’s Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommenda-
tions, these standards require that family benefits be granted in respect of each child in the family and to 
all children, for so long as the child is receiving education or vocational training on a full-time basis and is 
not in receipt of an adequate income determined by national legislation. They should be set at a level which 
relates directly to the actual cost of providing for a child and should represent a substantial contribution to 
this cost. Family allowances at the minimum rate should be granted regardless of means. Benefits above 
the minimum rate may be subject to a means test. Furthermore, all benefits should be adjusted in order to 
take into account changes in the cost of providing for children or in the general cost of living (ILO, 2011c, 
paras 184–86).

ILO Recommendation No. 202 further refines and extends the normative framework, aiming at universal 
protection. Income security for children is one of the basic social security guarantees constituting a national 
social protection floor, and should ensure “access to nutrition, education, care and any other necessary 
goods and services” (para. 5(b)). Although the guarantee should be nationally defined, the Recommenda-
tion provides clear guidance on its appropriate level: the minimum level of income security should allow for 
life in dignity and should be sufficient to provide for effective access to a set of necessary goods and ser-
vices, such as may be set out through national poverty lines and other comparable thresholds (para. 8(b)). 
Providing for universality of protection, the Recommendation sets out that the basic social security guar-
antee should apply to at least all residents, and all children, as defined in national laws and regulations and 
subject to existing international obligations (para. 6), that is, to the respective provisions of the CRC, the 
ICESCR and other relevant instruments. Representing an approach strongly focused on outcomes, Recom-
mendation No. 202 allows for a broad range of policy instruments to achieve income security for children, 
including child and family benefits (the focus of this chapter).

reduce families’ spending needs and can facilitate par-
ents’ availability to engage in paid employment know-
ing that their children are well cared for (e.g. UNICEF 
and ILO, 2013). Measures to facilitate access to health, 
education and care services, combined with measures to 
improve the availability and quality of those services, 
are necessary to ensure that children may realize their 
full potential.

Obviously,  income  security  for  children  is  im-
possible to achieve in isolation from the family and 
household context. Income security for children there-
fore mirrors the income security of their parents, 

grandparents and/or other carers. As a result, the range 
of policies and policy instruments available to achieve 
this goal is very broad, and reaches well beyond child 
and family benefits in a narrow sense: it also includes 
other social protection programmes as part of the na-
tional social security system, as well as broader pol-
icies that address decent and productive employment, 
wages and incomes, access to health care, education and 
other social services, as well as gender equality and care 
arrangements.1 

The broad range of policies that are necessary to 
achieve income security for children is reflected in the 

1  In this respect, the Joint Statement on Advancing Child-sensitive Social Protection (DfID et al., 2009) provides important guidelines for 
the design, implementation and monitoring of social security schemes and programmes (see box 2.2).

Box 2.2  Child-sensitive social protection

The Joint Statement on Advancing Child-sensitive Social Protection sets out that the design, implementation 
and evaluation of child-sensitive social protection programmes should aim to:
•  avoid adverse impacts on children, and reduce or mitigate social and economic risks that directly affect 

children’s lives; 

•  intervene as early as possible where children are at risk, in order to prevent irreversible impairment or 

harm;

•  consider the age and gender-specific risks and vulnerabilities of children throughout the life cycle;
•  mitigate the effects of shocks, exclusion and poverty on families, recognizing that families raising children 

need support to ensure equal opportunity;

•  make special provision to reach children who are particularly vulnerable and excluded, including children 
without parental care, and those who are marginalized within their families or communities due to their 
gender, disability, ethnicity, HIV and AIDS, or other factors;

•  consider the mechanisms and intra-household dynamics that may affect how children are reached, 
paying particular attention to the balance of power between men and women within the household and 
broader community; 

•  include the voices and opinions of children, their care-givers and youth in the understanding and design 

of social protection systems and programmes.

12

The joint statement (DfID et al., 2009) was issued by the DfID,  HelpAge International, Hope & Homes for 
Children, Institute of Development Studies, ILO, Overseas Development Institute, Save the Children UK, 
UNDP, UNICEF and the World Bank.

Joint Statement on Advancing Child-sensitive Social 
Protection issued in 2009 by a coalition of agencies, 
bilateral donor agencies and international NGOs (see 
box 2.2). This statement sets out important guide-
lines for the design, implementation and monitoring 
of social security schemes and programmes in order 
to ensure that the needs of children are addressed in a 
broad range of policies, including in national social pro-
tection systems and particularly national social protec-
tion floors. 

The need for a broad social protection approach 
to realizing children’s rights is also reflected in the 
recent World Report on Child Labour (ILO, 2013a; 
see box 2.3), which has highlighted the need to take a 
comprehensive and systemic view, considering the full 
range of social protection instruments, including those 
which ensure income security for working-age adults 
(e.g. unemployment protection, maternity benefits, 
disability benefits) and older persons (e.g. old-age pen-
sions). Social health protection occupies a key role in 
protecting households from health-related poverty risks 
which are closely associated with the incidence of child 
labour. Child-sensitive measures aimed at reducing and 
preventing child labour should therefore form part of 

an approach that sets out not only to strengthen na-
tional social security systems but also to ensure effective 
coordination with other related policy areas, including 
employment, wages and broader social policies. 

2.2   Expenditure on social protection  

for children and families

Public expenditure on social protection benefits aimed 
specifically at meeting the needs of children amounts 
to 0.4 per cent of total GDP worldwide, or 7.4 per cent 
of total social protection expenditure (excluding health 
expenditure) (see figures 2.1 and 2.2). These figures in-
clude child benefits and benefits targeting families with 
children, such as cash transfer programmes for children 
and families,2 whether provided in cash or in kind, but 
exclude provisions for health and education,3 two im-
portant related policy areas. 

There is wide variation across regions. Whereas 
countries in Western Europe spend on average 2.2 per 
cent of their GDP on child and family benefits, repre-
senting about one-tenth of their public social protec-
tion expenditure (excluding health expenditure), in all 

2  General social assistance and other benefits which may indirectly benefit children (e.g. maternity benefits) are not included.
3  The figures do, however, take into account some provisions designed to facilitate children’s participation in education, such as textbooks, 
uniforms and school meals, where these are provided as part of social protection programmes.

World Social Protection Report 2014/152. Social protection for children and families

Box 2.3  Social security systems and the prevention of child labour

Social protection is highly relevant to the prevention and reduction of child labour. Economic vulnerabilities 
associated with poverty and shocks are important drivers of child labour. Social protection instruments 
can play an important role in reducing child labour by mitigating these vulnerabilities and enhancing poor 
families’ resilience. These links are explored in detail in the World Report on Child Labour (ILO, 2013a). 

The links between social protection and child labour have received more attention with the emergence of 
conditional cash transfer programmes that explicitly link the receipt of cash benefits to school attendance 
or similar conditions. Many programmes have been found to have a significant effect in promoting school 
enrolment and attendance, yet it is not fully clear whether these effects result directly from the behavioural 
conditions, or indirectly through the income effect and a stronger emphasis on supply-side factors, that is, 
in ensuring that schools are actually available and accessible for poor children (ILO, 2013a; Barrientos et al., 
2013). From the few evaluations that have systematically assessed the impact on children’s work, it can be 
deduced that, while cash benefits tend to have a strong impact on school attendance, they may not reduce 
child labour to the same extent: many children combine school and work. Reductions in child labour are 
more evident where cash benefits are integrated with additional programme elements, such as after-school 
programmes, as in Brazil.1

Economic vulnerability is not the only cause of child labour, and social protection is not by itself a com-
plete answer to it. Nonetheless, social protection is a critical pillar of a broader policy response to child 
labour. Efforts against child labour are unlikely to be successful in the absence of a social protection floor 
to safeguard vulnerable households and to enable them to seize opportunities and to break the intergenera-
tional transmission of poverty. 

Although other elements of social security systems have not been systematically assessed with regard 
to their impact on child labour, it can be assumed that they also have a positive effect in so far as they 
reduce the vulnerability of poor households and address poverty risks that may otherwise promote child 
labour. This is, for example, the case for social health protection, reflecting the fact that ill health consti-
tutes a major poverty risk for vulnerable households. Measures to reduce the income insecurity of adults, 
including unemployment protection, employment guarantee schemes, disability benefits, maternity benefits 
and social pensions, also contribute to mitigating vulnerability for poor households, and can contribute to 
preventing and reducing child labour.

Within any broader social security system, building a national social protection floor is particularly relevant 
to addressing vulnerabilities associated with child labour. Social protection floors provide a set of basic 
social security guarantees, including a basic level of income security throughout the life cycle and access 
to essential health care. These basic guarantees, in turn, are essential in addressing the multifaceted eco-
nomic and social vulnerabilities which promote and sustain child labour. Where children and their families 
enjoy basic income security and access to essential health care, and where the necessary education and 
other services are in place, child labour can be effectively prevented. Indeed, evidence presented in this 
report suggests that an approach linking cash and in-kind benefits with access to education and health 
services can be particularly effective in addressing child labour. 

1  Such elements were successfully implemented in the Brazilian PETI programme, which was integrated into the Bolsa 
Família programme in 2006.

other regions, less than 1 per cent of GDP is allocated 
to child and family benefits, even though in most of 
them children form a significantly higher proportion 
of the total population than in Europe. Despite the 
recent extension of cash transfer programmes, public 
expenditure on child benefits in Latin America and the 
Caribbean reaches only 0.7 per cent of GDP, or 6.5 per 
cent of public social protection expenditure (exclud-
ing health expenditure), a level similar to that prevail-
ing in North America, the Middle East, and Central 
and Eastern Europe. In Asia and the Pacific, and in 
Africa, on average 0.2 per cent of GDP is allocated to 
child and family benefits. In the case of Africa, in par-
ticular, the low proportion of public expenditure on 

child and family benefits is particularly striking, con-
sidering the high proportion of children in the total 
population (children under 15 make up 42 per cent of 
Africa’s population).

It is clear that the level of resources allocated is not 
sufficient to respond adequately to the income security 
needs of children and families, even when taking into 
account that these needs are also addressed through 
other means, including public health, education and 
care services. Underinvestment in the social protection 
needs of children is particularly critical in low-income 
countries, which on average allocate less than 0.1 per 
cent of their GDP to child and family benefits. This 
points to a significant underinvestment in children,

which is likely to have negative effects on the future 
productivity of these countries’ workforce, and their 
future economic and social development prospects.

The overall level of resources allocated to children 
and families depends, among other factors, on the 
composition of the set of benefits and services avail-
able. These reach beyond social protection in a narrow 
sense, and are only partly included in measures of social 
protection expenditure. While in some countries cash 
benefits play a major role in the overall package of bene-
fits and services available to families, in others the pro-
vision of benefits in kind (e.g. school meals and other 
nutrition interventions, affordable housing) or the pro-
vision of services (e.g. childcare) plays a more dominant 
role, and obviously also affects the income security of 
families with children. The provision of quality public 
education, childcare and health services (see Chapter 5) 
also has implications for ensuring income security 
for families with children by reducing their need to 
allocate scarce resources to school fees and the costs 
of health and other care; yet these services also suffer 
from considerable underinvestment in some parts of the 
world. The availability of childcare services, along with 
the presence of public policies and measures adopted by 

employers to facilitate sharing work and family respon-
sibilities for parents with children, will also affect the 
income security of children.

Child and family benefit programmes 
anchored in national legislation

Taking account of the wide range of social protection 
benefits and services needed to ensure children’s well-
being and the realization of their rights, this chap-
ter  focuses in particular on child and family benefits 
aiming at enhancing income security, and considers 
them in relation to the social security benefits discussed 
in other chapters of this report.4

Child and family benefits include various types 
of social protection benefits or combinations thereof 
(see figure 2.3). Some countries provide universal 
child benefits that cover all children, independently 
of the employment or income status of their parents, 
and are usually financed out of general taxation. Bene-
fits are usually flat, but benefit rates may be differenti-
ated by the age of the child or by taking into account 

4  In this respect, it is also useful to consider the labour market and employment implications of child and family benefits. These can 
also influence labour markets and wage-setting, and in terms of policy-making this may be seen as an important function in its own 
right. If the costs of bringing up children are at least partially met through collectively financed benefits (from general taxation or social 
insurance contributions), the differential needs of workers with children, as compared to workers without children, will not have to be met 
(exclusively) through wages. This may be seen as providing a more “level playing field” between workers with and without family obligations, 
and thus minimizing one possible source of distortion in the general wage structure. This outcome is seen in many high-income countries, 
where child benefits are available on an equal basis for all children, usually without means testing.

the total number of children in the family. In some 
countries, benefits are fully or partially organized 
through the tax system, by providing tax rebates or a 
negative income tax to families with children.5 Em-
ployment-related child or family benefits, usually fi-
nanced through contributions and organized through 
social insurance schemes, cover mostly employees in 
the formal economy. Means-tested child and family 
benefits (specific social assistance benefits for children 
and families) are usually targeted towards poor families 
and children. They include a wide range of cash trans-
fer programmes for children and families introduced 
in recent years, including conditional and non-condi-
tional benefits.6 These programmes have had a major 
impact on extending coverage and providing at least 
a minimum level of income security to children and 
families. Figure 2.3 summarizes the different types of 

programmes, and combinations thereof, through which 
cash benefits for children and families are provided. 
It focuses on programmes anchored in national legis-
lation, as these are usually more stable in terms of fund-
ing and institutional frameworks, guarantee coverage as 
a matter of right, and provide legal entitlements to eli-
gible individuals and households. In addition to these 
programmes, in some countries other programmes exist 
which are not yet anchored in national legislation, in-
cluding pilot or temporary programmes, often limited 
to certain regions or districts. 

In 108 countries out of the 183 for which sufficient 
data are available, periodic child or family benefits in 
cash are provided to eligible families and/or children. 
Many of the remaining 75 countries do, however, have 
more general social assistance programmes, which may 
provide benefits contributing to income security for 

5  In fact, the tax system plays a strong – and often neglected – role in redistributive policies for children and families (e.g. Adema, Fron and 
Ladaique, 2014).
6  Some of these programmes include benefits for categories of the population other than children, and would therefore, strictly speaking, 
be classified as general social assistance programmes rather than child and family benefits. Indeed, some tend to be perceived as focusing 
exclusively on children and families, although in fact they have a broader remit.

children and families, in the absence of specific child or 
family benefits. In addition to these cash benefits, many 
countries provide benefits in kind of various types, in-
cluding access to free or subsidized goods (e.g. school 
meals). 

Figure 2.4 illustrates the global distribution of child 
or family benefit programmes anchored in legislation. 
Some countries, particularly in Western Europe, pro-
vide such benefits to all children on a universal basis, 
financed out of general taxation, sometimes supple-
mented by specific social assistance benefits. Other 
countries, particularly in Africa and Latin America, 
have traditionally provided family allowances as part 
of their social insurance system or rely on a system of 
employer liability, requiring employers to pay family 
benefits to their workers. Where the provision of child 
benefits is directly or indirectly linked to an employ-
ment relationship, coverage rates tend to be lower than 
for universal provision, especially in countries with a 
large informal economy. In some of these countries, 

however, means-tested benefits complement employ-
ment-related family benefits and provide an important 
support for workers in the informal economy. In an-
other group of countries, means-tested benefits consti-
tute the dominant form of provision, either focusing 
on a relatively small group of vulnerable children and 
families, or providing a much wider coverage.7

While many countries in Latin America and the 
Caribbean combine employment-related benefits with 
non-contributory benefits anchored in legislation, 
thereby covering a substantial proportion of chil-
dren and families, this is not the case in large parts of 
Africa and of Asia and the Pacific. Here, non-contrib-
utory programmes are not yet well enough developed 
to cover substantial numbers of children and families; 
many programmes still remain at a “pilot” stage with 
limited geographical coverage. More efforts are needed 
to anchor programmes in legislation in order to estab-
lish a clear definition of eligibility criteria and benefits, 
and a more stable basis for the implementation of these 

7  While most of these countries target child and family benefits to the poor in the form of specific social assistance benefits for families with 
children, there is a small group of countries which use a relatively light income or asset test to exclude affluent population groups from the 
provision of child benefits but maintain provision for the broad majority of the population (e.g. Cyprus, following a recent reform).

programmes, especially with regard to financial sustain-
ability and institutional capacities.

An important aspect of the observed trends around 
the world is the extent to which countries are able to 
make provision for all residents, or at least those in 
need. Figure 2.5 shows that the achievement of this 
objective is linked to different priorities and traditions, 

and to some extent also to economic capacities avail-
able in the different parts of the world. While universal 
provision of child benefits is prevalent particularly in 
Europe and North America, in other parts of the world 
coverage tends to be more limited, usually to children 
of those employed in the formal economy and/or those 
in poor families.

As with other areas of social security, the level of 
legal coverage of cash child and family benefits is cor-
related with the mode of provision and financing (see 
figure 2.6). Where child benefits are financed mainly 
through employers, particularly in countries where in-
formality of employment prevails, coverage levels tend 
to be rather low. High levels of coverage usually require 
that the government take responsibility for financing 
the benefits by complementing coverage through ex-
isting contributory programmes for those groups of 
the population not or not sufficiently covered, whether 
through the provision of non-contributory benefits (as 
e.g. in Argentina or France) or through a large-scale non-
contributory universal programme (as e.g. in Canada, 
Germany or Mongolia), in either case financed from 
either general taxation or other government revenue.

2.4   Closing coverage gaps and strengthening 
income security for children and families

Closing gaps in the coverage of child and family bene-
fits is essential for ensuring income security for children 
and families. While universal or near-universal coverage 
is a reality in many OECD countries, and in many low- 
and middle-income countries the introduction of new 
child and family benefit programmes and the reform of 
existing ones have improved coverage to some extent, 
large gaps nevertheless remain. 

The most prominent new development is the emer-
gence of non-contributory cash transfer programmes 
in many low- and middle-income countries.8 These pro-
grammes provide regular cash benefits to all families, or 
to poor families in particular, and have been found to 
have a strong impact on various dimensions of human 
development, whether they are explicitly linked to 
health- and education-related conditions (conditional 
cash transfer programmes) or not (unconditional cash 
transfer programmes). Conditional cash transfer pro-
grammes make the payment of cash benefits conditional 
upon compliance with specific “behavioural” condi-
tions. Typically, the programmes require that families 
ensure their children’s enrolment and attendance at 
school, and participate in specified health programmes, 
for example making regular visits to a clinic, or present-
ing children for vaccinations – stipulations that make 

demands on the availability, accessibility and quality of 
such services. If beneficiaries do not meet the specified 
conditions, sanctions may be applied, typically through 
the suspension or termination of benefits. Given that the 
beneficiaries are likely to be poor or very poor, the very 
potential for sanctions may itself be controversial, and 
the human rights implications of behavioural conditions 
in cash transfer programmes have been subject of intense 
debate (see e.g. ILO, 2011a, pp. 118–120; de Brauw and 
Hoddinott, 2008; Dornan and Porter, 2013).9

The considerable variety of cash transfer programmes 
that have emerged in recent years is only insufficiently 
described by the usual dichotomy of conditional and 
non-conditional programmes. Following the establish-
ment of the Progresa/Oportunidades programme in 
Mexico, the first wave of conditional cash transfer pro-
grammes was concentrated in Latin America (Fiszbein 
and Schady, 2009; Barrientos, 2013), where conditional 
cash transfer programmes are now firmly established as 
an integral element of many national social security sys-
tems (see figure 2.7). By now, the largest programme in 
absolute terms is Bolsa Família in Brazil, which reaches 
around  11.3  million  families  comprising  46  mil-
lion people, corresponding to about a quarter of Bra-
zil’s population – at an annual cost of US$3.9 billion 
(0.4 per cent of GDP). Similar programmes were im-
plemented in 16 other Latin American and Caribbean 
countries, covering around 70 million people or 12 per 
cent of the population in the region (figure 2.7). Some 
programmes have developed distinctive features, such as 
the individualized support and transformational nature 
of the Chilean Chile Solidario programme (replaced 
by the Ingreso Ético Familiar programme in 2012; see 
UNICEF, 2012). Several cash transfer programmes for 
children and families also exist in Africa (e.g. in Ghana, 
Kenya, Malawi and South Africa) and in Asia (e.g. in 
Indonesia, the Philippines and Pakistan). 

Some programmes combine conditional and non-
conditional elements, such as the universal child al-
lowance in Argentina (see box 2.4 below). In other 
countries, many of them in Africa, behavioural condi-
tions are nominally part of the design of cash transfer 
programmes, yet are not fully implemented and moni-
tored in practice. Some of these programmes have been 
introduced with “soft” conditions, under which the 
extent to which sanctions (usually the suspension or 

8  Because of their strong focus on children, cash transfer programmes are often considered as child or family benefit programmes, although 
it may also be argued that they share many features with generalized social assistance schemes.
9  Moreover, as the responsibility for meeting these conditions mostly falls on mothers, these programmes have further-reaching 
implications for women’s social and economic rights (e.g. Molyneux, 2007).

termination of benefits) are applied in cases of non-
compliance takes into account the influence of factors 
beyond the beneficiaries’ control, especially in respect 
of the poorest and most vulnerable. In some cases, con-
ditions are applied, if at all, with considerable discre-
tion, particularly in contexts where there is a significant 
lack of infrastructure and qualified staff. Where in-
stitutional capacities are limited, a strict adherence to 
behavioural conditions would be neither feasible nor 
equitable, given the often insufficient supply of educa-
tion and health services, in terms of both quantity and 
quality, especially in remote areas. 

The extension of cash transfer programmes for chil-
dren and families has continued during recent years, and 
in some countries has even accelerated, whether in order 
to cushion the impact of the global crisis on children and 
families or with a more general objective of reducing pov-
erty. In Haiti, a new conditional cash transfer scheme 
(Ti Manman Cheri) was introduced in 2012, with an 
initial annual budget estimated at US$13 million. In 
Honduras, the Bono 10,000 conditional cash transfer 
programme now provides cash benefits to poor families 
with children under 18 or pregnant women on condition 

that they commit to obligations with regard to school at-
tendance and health care. In Mexico, the nutrition sup-
port programme Programa de Apoyo Alimentario (PAL) 
was expanded within the framework of the Oportuni-
dades programme in 2010. Brazil extended coverage of 
the Bolsa Família programme by including more benefi-
ciary categories, implementing an “active search” strat-
egy to register extremely poor families not yet covered 
and increasing the amount of benefit paid. The budget 
has increased from 11.9 billion real (BRL) in 2009 to 
BRL23 billion in 2013, constituting approximately 
0.5 per cent of GDP (Hermeto and Caetano, forthcom-
ing). Thailand extended its education policy from 12 years 
of free basic education to 15 years in 2009 as part of its 
first stimulus package, allocating 18 billion baht to this 
programme in the first year with a view to drawing all 
children, including stateless and ethnic minority children, 
and children of migrants, into education from pre-school 
through high school and vocational education. Germany 
increased the level of child benefits in 2009 and 2010. 
Japan established a new universal allowance for children 
“of junior high school age” in 2010, and in 2012 made fur-
ther changes to the law to allow for higher benefit levels,

Box 2.4  The universal child allowance in Argentina 

Argentina closed a gap in the coverage of child benefits through the introduction of the universal child al-
lowance (Asignación universal por hijo) for up to five children per family in 2009. This benefit complements 
the existing contributory family benefits for formal sector workers in the low and middle wage brackets and 
income tax rebates for workers in the highest income group. The scheme covers children of Argentinian 
nationality or children who have been resident in the country for at least three years whose parents fall 
into one of the following categories and do not already receive any other type of social assistance pay-
ments: those subject to the social monotributo (simplified social security regime for workers with very low 
incomes); the unemployed; those working in the informal economy; and domestic workers earning less than 
the adjustable minimum living wage. In addition to the 4.3 million children already covered through the 
other schemes (contributory family allowance and income tax rebate), the scheme now provides benefits to 
3.3 million more children, representing 29 per cent of all children under the age of 18. 

Families receive 460 pesos (ARS), equivalent to about US$69, for each child under 18, or ARS1,500 (about 
US$224) for a child with an assessed disability (without age limit). Of the total benefit, 80 per cent is paid 
monthly to benefit recipients through the social insurance institution. The remaining 20 per cent is depos-
ited in a savings account in the name of the beneficiary with the National Bank. This sum can be recovered 
(on behalf of children in their care up to the age of six) when the beneficiary provides evidence of the chil-
dren having undergone medical check-ups and necessary vaccinations or (for children aged 5–18) being 
enrolled in public education. 

The cost of the scheme is estimated at approximately 0.5 per cent of GDP, financed out of earnings-
related contributions and taxes and the annual interest on the Sustainability Guarantee Fund of the state 
pension system, created in 2007.

It is estimated that the scheme reaches 70 per cent of children living in poverty (between 80 and 90 per 
cent of very poor children) and that it reduces the proportion of poor and very poor children by 18 per cent 
and 65 per cent, respectively. Some 40 per cent of those who receive this benefit are not poor, most of 
them belonging to households with total incomes only slightly above the value of the poverty line. The Gini 
index shows a drop of approximately one percentage point as a result of the scheme. The combined impact 
of the contributory and non-contributory schemes is to reduce inequality by approximately 5 per cent. The 
total income of the poorest 10 per cent is increased by approximately 30 per cent as a result of the benefit.

depending on age and number of children in a house-
hold, while also reintroducing an income ceiling above 
which a household was not eligible for the allowance.
While universal or quasi-universal coverage of all 
children is achieved predominantly in high-income 
countries, some middle-income countries have made 
great strides towards universal coverage: for example, in 
Argentina (see box 2.4), the universal child allowance 
introduced in 2009 extended coverage to families of un-
employed people and those in the informal economy 
who were previously uncovered (Bertranou and Maur-
izio, 2012a). Mongolia also reintroduced its child allow-
ance with virtually universal coverage, covering close to 
900,000 children (99.6 per cent of all children) in 2012; 
the programme is funded from a mineral resource tax ac-
cumulated in the country’s Human Development Fund. 
Some initiatives represent notable progress towards 
more nearly universal coverage anchored in national 
legislation. The South African Child Support Grant, 
for example (see box 2.5), although means tested, covers 
more than half of all children under the age of 18, 

and has had significant impacts on children’s nutri-
tion, physical development and education (e.g. Patel 
et al., 2012; Patel, Hochfeld and Moodley, 2013; DSD, 
SASSA and UNICEF South Africa, 2012; Eyal and 
Woolard, 2013). In Colombia, a law was passed in 2011 
that rendered access to the Más Familias en Acción pro-
gramme a right, and raised benefit levels; as a result, the 
number of beneficiaries increased from 2.1 million to 
2.6 million (Alviar García, 2013).

In many low- and middle-income countries, only a 
small minority of children and families receive child 
benefits. Where specific child or family benefit pro-
grammes do exist, they tend to be largely focused on 
workers in the formal economy and/or selected cat-
egories of disadvantaged children, such as orphans and 
vulnerable children. For example, the Kesejahteraan 
Sosial Anak programme (PKSA) in Indonesia provides 
conditional cash benefits for several categories of vul-
nerable children, including abandoned children, street 
children, young offenders and children with disabil-
ities.10 Many general social assistance programmes also 

10  Due to challenges in identifying eligible children, many vulnerable children remain outside the reach of this programme (ILO, 2012c).

22

Box 2.5  The Child Support Grant in South Africa 

The Child Support Grant (CSG) in South Africa plays an important role in providing income security to poor 
children. Although the grant is means tested, the scheme reached 10.8 million children in 2012, that is, 
more than half of all children under the age of 18.1 Coverage has been significantly extended by gradually 
increasing the maximum age threshold from seven years before 2003 to 18 years in 2008, and by adjusting 
the income threshold to inflation. 

A monthly benefit of 300 rand (ZAR), equivalent to about US$28, per child is provided to caregivers who 
are South African nationals or permanent residents, and whose annual earnings are below ZAR34,800 for 
a single adult and ZAR69,600 for a couple. Applicants need to provide proof of income or of their status 
as unemployed, as appropriate. However, in order to facilitate access to the benefit for eligible families, 
particularly the poorest, the Government made efforts to disseminate information about eligibility criteria, 
simplify the procedure and reduce the number of documents applicants needed.

By and large, the grant is considered to have been successful in targeting poor households and to have 
had a marked impact on children’s lives. In addition to poverty alleviation, studies also demonstrated 
positive effects on early childhood development, school attendance and educational attainments, including 
narrowing the schooling gap between children whose mothers have less education and those with more, 
improvements in overall health status, and reductions in risky behaviours by adolescents. Early enrolment 
in the programme was found to produce stronger impacts. Beyond the children themselves, the grant also 
facilitated access to the labour market for unemployed caregivers, especially for women.

Box 2.6  Providing benefits for orphans and vulnerable children:  

The Livelihood Empowerment Against Poverty (LEAP) programme in Ghana

The Livelihood Empowerment Against Poverty programme (LEAP) is a conditional cash transfer programme, 
currently implemented in about half of Ghana’s districts, which targets extremely poor households that 
include one or more orphans and vulnerable children, people over the age of 65 or people with a severe 
disability. Orphans and vulnerable children are defined as children under 18 years of age who have lost one 
or both parents, who are chronically ill or living in a household headed by a child or a chronically ill person, 
or whose parents’ whereabouts are unknown.

Of the 246,115 beneficiaries, 48.2 per cent are children up to 17 years of age. Depending on the number 
of eligible individuals in the household, the monthly benefit amounts to 24–45 cedi (about US$9–17), 
paid every two months. A recent UNICEF study (Cooke et al., 2014) showed that scaling up the LEAP pro-
gramme to 500,000 beneficiaries could alleviate the impact on the poorest groups in the population of the 
removal of the fuel subsidy; even so, further measures will be necessary to have a broader impact on the 
reduction and prevention of poverty. 

Beneficiary households with children under the age of 15 commit themselves to certain co-responsibilities 
when they sign up for LEAP. These include school attendance (with a maximum absenteeism of 20 per 
cent) and vaccinations and health check-ups for children under the age of five. Households in communities 
that are not covered by education or health facilities or where the capacity of existing facilities is insufficient 
are exempted from these conditions. Monitoring of compliance should take place every three months, 
and households not complying should receive warnings, house visits and, in the case of repeated non-
compliance, penalties; but for the time being these are soft conditions, as no reliable mechanism to monitor 
compliance is currently in place.

In order to ensure they have access to health care, LEAP beneficiaries are automatically registered in the 
National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS). As a result, beneficiaries are more likely to be covered under the 
NHIS than non-recipient households, although those also benefit from contribution exemptions for children, 
pregnant women, older people and the very poor (Handa et al., 2013).

benefit children living in vulnerable households, such 
as the Programa Subsidio de Alimentos cash transfer 
programme in Mozambique, whose total budget allo-
cation more than doubled from 0.16 to 0.35 per cent 
of GDP between 2008 and 2013 (Cunha et al., 2013). 
Many of the newer programmes in African countries, 

though they may be of significant size, operate as pilot 
programmes covering only certain districts, such as the 
LEAP programme in Ghana (see box 2.6) and similar 
schemes in Kenya and Malawi (García and Moore, 
2012; Monchuk, 2014).

World Social Protection Report 2014/152. Social protection for children and families

Recent developments have also demonstrated that 
cash transfers alone cannot offer income security for 
all children and families. More attention is needed 
to the formulation and application of integrated ap-
proaches that ensure effective coordination between 
different policy areas addressing children’s needs, in-
cluding health, education, care and child protection. 
In addition, connection with employment policies is of 
critical importance. A particular policy concern is es-
tablishing the optimal mix in provision of allowances 
in cash, on the one hand, and the availability and ac-
cessibility of quality childcare services and early child-
hood education, on the other – the latter playing a key 
role in protecting children from poverty by allowing 
their parents to work knowing that their children are 
well cared for (e.g. OECD, 2011a; UNICEF and ILO, 
2013; ILO and UNDP, 2009; UNESCO, 2014). Such 
measures can have a significant impact on the income 
security of families with children, in particular for sin-
gle-parent families. 

Rich evidence of the impact of social protection 
policies, combined with other social policies, on the 
income security of children can be found in many 
 European  and  some  other  OECD  countries.  The 
OECD  has  developed  a  sophisticated  monitoring 
system, using a set of indicators and focused research 

studies, to analyse the availability of child and family 
benefits and other family-oriented policies and their 
outcomes (OECD, 2009c; OECD, 2011a; OECD, 
2014b). Such a monitoring system can also facilitate na-
tional monitoring of the implementation of ILO Rec-
ommendation No. 202. Strengthening such national 
monitoring capacities should be a priority in many low- 
and middle-income countries. 

2.5   How fiscal consolidation and adjustment 

measures threaten income security for 
children and families 

While many countries have in recent years taken deci-
sive steps to extend coverage of child and family protec-
tion measures and increase benefit levels, others have 
cut back provision in this area as part of fiscal consoli-
dation measures implemented in the wake of the global 
crisis (see box 2.7). Some countries (e.g. Denmark, Ire-
land, Israel) have reduced the level of child benefits for 
all children, or for children in larger families; others 
(e.g. Denmark, Latvia) have introduced an effective 
ceiling on the total amount of child benefits or low-
ered the maximum age up to which children are eligible 
for child benefits (e.g. Ireland, Latvia). Some countries 

23

Box 2.7  The effects of fiscal consolidation and adjustment measures on child and family benefits 
Several countries, in particular in the developed world, have in recent years adopted contraction measures 
that have affected child and family benefits, a few in the early stages of the crisis (e.g. Ireland, Estonia) and 
more since 2010. Examples of such measures include the following:
•  In Denmark, child benefits were successively reduced by 5 per cent each year in 2011, 2012 and 2013, 

and a ceiling on total child benefits was set at 35,000 kroner per year.

•  In Ireland’s 2013 budget, the child benefit payment level was reduced for the third time since 2010, in 
addition to other measures. Overall, a family with two children will have lost €864 in annual support since 
2010. Back-to-school allowances were also cut in the 2012 and 2013 budgets. 

•  Israel announced the reduction of child allowances for children born after 1 June 2003 to a flat amount 
of 140 shekels (ILS), about US$39, for each child, replacing the earlier system of benefit rates in-
creasing with the number of children. The cuts in child allowances are expected to save the Government 
ILS2.9 billion in 2014. 

•  In Latvia, family benefits were reduced to a flat amount per child, replacing the higher benefit rates for 
subsequent children in a household, thereby effectively reducing the total amount of child benefits for 
larger families. In addition, the maximum eligible age was reduced from 20 to 19 years for children in 
education.

•  In Mongolia, the Child Money Programme was terminated at the end of 2009. However, in 2012 it was 

reintroduced as a universal programme.

•  The United Kingdom’s 2012 budget introduced a progressive income tax charge on child benefit in order 
to offset the value of the benefit for people earning over £60,000. Individuals earning between £50,000 
and £60,000 will be charged with a portion of the amount of the benefit. The charge applies to the 
higher-earning partner in households receiving child benefit. Changes to the rules on child benefit are 
expected to reduce the entitlement of about 1.2 million families. 

Sources: Jackson et al., 2011; Gauthier, 2010; national sources.

effectively excluded more affluent families by introduc-
ing an asset test (e.g. Cyprus) or a tax for those earning 
above a certain threshold which claws back the child 
benefit (United Kingdom), thus restricting the univer-
sal scope of such benefits. 

Unless other compensatory measures are taken, 
these developments are likely to threaten the income 
security of families with children, particularly that of 
larger families, many of which are already at higher 
risk of poverty than others. There is a risk that in some 
countries such measures may jeopardize the progress 
achieved in reducing child poverty in recent years. 

Indeed, child poverty has increased in 19 of the 
28 Member States of the European Union between 
2007 and 2012; by the latter year, more than one-quarter 

of children in Bulgaria, Greece, Italy,  Romania and 
Spain were living at risk of poverty.11 This increase in 
child poverty has given rise to concern about negative 
long-term effects with regard to the future employ-
ment prospects of today’s children, and about the 
future productivity and competitiveness of European 
 economies (European Commission, 2014a). 

The increasing pressure on public budgets in many 
emerging economies may slow down further progress 
with respect to the income security of children and fam-
ilies, or even reverse the improvements already achieved. 
It is therefore essential to ensure that fiscal consolida-
tion measures do not compromise the successes achieved 
to date in many countries through a broad and inte-
grated range of social protection policies for children.

3.1   Introduction: The quest for income security 

Social protection for women and men of working age1 
includes a range of aspects. This chapter will focus in 
particular on income security, which is an essential 
component of the well-being of individuals and fam-
ilies. An overall majority of people of working age are 
economically active, and generally gain their livelihoods 
through income-generating activity, whether in formal 
or informal employment, and whether such activity 
can be categorized as decent work2 or not. The social 
security needs of people of working age generally fall 
into three broad categories: first, the need to replace 
income lost temporarily or permanently as a result of 

1  Working age is broadly defined here as the age range during which 
most people are, or seek to be, economically active, reflecting the 
life-cycle approach of the Social Protection Floors Recommendation, 
2012 (No. 202), and being aware that in many contexts women and 
men continue to be economically active, out of choice or necessity, until 
well into old age (see Chapter 4). The upper and lower boundaries of 
“working age” are highly dependent on national contexts, as defined by 
national legislation and practice, and often depend on the length of time 
that people spend in education and statutory pensionable ages. For the 
purpose of the comparability of statistical indicators, this report follows 
established international practice in using an age range of 15–64 years, 
but this is not to imply that all individuals within this age range can or 
should conform to a specific notion of “work” or “activity”.
2  Decent work has been defined by the ILO and endorsed by the 
international community as productive work for women and men in 
conditions of freedom, equity, security and human dignity. Decent 
work involves opportunities for work that is productive and delivers a 
fair income; provides security in the workplace and social protection 
for workers and their families; offers better prospects for personal 
development and encourages social integration; gives people the 
freedom to express their concerns, to organize and to participate in 
decisions that affect their lives; and guarantees equal opportunities and 
equal treatment for all.

KEY MESSAGES

 n Social protection supports women and men 
of working age by stabilizing their incomes 
in the event of unemployment, employment 
injury,  disability,  sickness  and  maternity, 
and by ensuring that they have at least a 
basic level of income security.

 n While the labour market serves as the pri-
mary  source  of  income  security  during 
working life, social security plays a major 
role in smoothing incomes and aggregate 
demand,  thereby  facilitating  structural 
change within economies.

 n Worldwide, 2.3 per cent of GDP is allocated 
to  public  social  protection  expenditure 
ensuring  income  security  during  working 
age; regionally, levels vary widely, ranging 
from 0.5 per cent in Africa to 5.9 per cent 
in Western Europe.

 n Better social protection, including support 
in coping with the financial consequences 
of life events and improved access to health 
care, will help workers to find and sustain 
decent and productive employment. 

 n Policy coherence between social protection 
policies on the one hand, and employment, 
labour  market  and  wage  policies  on  the 
other, is essential in order to ensure that 
social  security  systems  are  efficient, 
effective and sustainable.

unemployment, employment injury, disability, sickness 
or maternity; second, the need for income support or 
other social protection measures where income is in-
sufficient to avoid poverty and/or social exclusion; and 
third, the need for support to restore earning capacity 
after any of the contingencies listed above and to facili-
tate participation in employment. 

According to the Social Protection Floors Recom-
mendation, 2012 (No. 202), the objective of national 
social protection floors is to guarantee, at a minimum, 
“basic income security, at least at a nationally defined 
minimum level, for persons in active age who are unable 
to earn sufficient income, in particular in cases of sick-
ness, unemployment, maternity and disability”. Other 
ILO social security standards provide more detailed 
guidance for specific policy areas. The following sec-
tions of this chapter will focus on four policy areas most 
relevant to people of working age, namely, unemploy-
ment protection (section 3.2), employment injury pro-
tection (section 3.3), disability benefits (section 3.4) 
and maternity protection (section 3.5). Access to health 
and sickness benefits, which also have important impli-
cations for income security during working age, is dis-
cussed in Chapter 5.

Most people seek income security during working 
life in the first instance through participation in the 
labour market. Income security is strongly dependent 
on the level, distribution and stability of earnings and 
other income from work, and is therefore significantly 
influenced by policy choices and the adoption and en-
forcement of legislation in a number of areas. Policy 
areas particularly relevant to income security include 
employment, employment protection, wages (includ-
ing minimum wages) and collective bargaining, and 
active labour market policies, as well as policies to sup-
port workers with family and care responsibilities and to 
promote gender equality in employment. Recent labour 
market and employment trends have increased the pres-
sure on social security systems to ensure income security 
for persons of working age. These trends include in par-
ticular higher risks of unemployment, underemployment 
and informality (e.g. ILO, 2014a; ILO, 2014b); increas-
ing prevalence of precarious forms of work; and declin-
ing wage shares, dwindling real wages and inadequate 
wages (e.g. ILO, 2013b; ILO, 2014c), leading to persis-
tently high proportions of working poor (ILO, 2014a). 
In the light of these observations, it is very clear that 
income security cannot be achieved by social security 
alone. Social protection policies need to be coordinated 
with well-designed policies to address these challenges 
in the fields of employment, labour market and wage 

policies, with a view to alleviating excessive burdens on 
national social security systems and allowing them to 
work more efficiently and more effectively. 

Most employment-related, contributory social se-
curity programmes cover those people (and their de-
pendants) who have been economically active in the 
past, but have lost their income from work either per-
manently or temporarily owing to loss of their current 
job (unemployment benefits), sickness, longer-term dis-
ability or death resulting from a work-related accident 
or disease (employment injury benefits), circumstances 
not directly related to work (general sickness, disability 
and survivors’ benefits) or pregnancy, childbirth and 
family responsibilities (maternity, paternity or parental 
benefits, child or family benefits).

However, these types of programme often do not 
cover the situations and needs of people (and their 
dependants) who are economically active but not in 
formal employment, whose income from employment 
is too low to prevent them and their families from fall-
ing into poverty, or who simply have no income at all, 
having been unemployed or underemployed for too 
long to qualify for benefits, with no prospect of such 
a situation coming to an end, even in the long term. 
These three groups – those in the informal economy, 
the working poor in formal employment and the long-
term unemployed – usually fall outside the coverage of 
contributory social security programmes. 

People in these groups may be covered by non-con-
tributory programmes providing benefits in cash and in 
kind, such as social assistance or universal schemes. In 
countries where a large majority of the labour force is 
covered by contributory social insurance programmes, 
non-contributory programmes are most frequently 
addressed to those who are not covered by social in-
surance, namely, the long-term unemployed and the 
working poor. In economies where informality and 
large-scale poverty prevails, for many decades social as-
sistance programmes, if they existed at all, were typically 
small and fragmented. However, in many such countries 
the last two decades have seen the development of large-
scale non-contributory programmes targeted mainly at 
poor households. These sometimes link entitlements to 
benefits to beneficiaries’ participation in public service 
programmes such as health care or education (usually 
referred to as conditional cash transfers or CCTs), or to 
participation in public employment programmes (often 
referred to as cash-for-work programmes), vocational 
training or entrepreneurship support programmes.

While this chapter will focus mainly on cash bene-
fits, it is important to note that benefits in kind, in

particular health care and other social services, play an 
important role in ensuring income security for people 
of working age. The role of health-care provision (see 
Chapter 5 for more detail) is particularly important in 
this respect: people who enjoy effective access to qual-
ity public health services or are financially protected 
through affordable (social) health insurance will have 
higher income security than those at risk of having to 
pay high out-of-pocket costs for health care in times of 
need. The provision of other social services and related 
benefits in kind that have a monetary value, includ-
ing education and care services, can also significantly 
reduce people’s income needs. The provision of services 
such as employment services, skills development pro-
grammes, childcare facilities and long-term care services 
may also have an impact on people’s ability to engage 
in paid employment, with important implications for 
income security, particularly for women (e.g. Martínez 
Franzoni and Sanchéz-Ancochea, 2014).

Worldwide, about one-third of total non-health 
public social protection expenditure, amounting to 
2.3 per cent of GDP, is spent on benefits for people of 
working age (see figures 3.1 and 3.2).3 These include 
unemployment benefits, employment injury benefits, 
disability benefits, maternity benefits and general social 
assistance. Within this overall figure, regional variations 
are significant, ranging from less than 0.5 per cent in 
Africa and 1.5 per cent in Asia and the Pacific to 5.9 per 
cent in Western European countries. While non-health 

public social protection expenditure for people of work-
ing age accounts for close to one-third of overall non-
health social protection expenditure in Western Europe, 
it accounts for roughly half of this category of expend-
iture in Latin America and in the Middle East. In 
Africa, such expenditure accounts for about one- quarter 
of non-health social protection expenditure, a lower pro-
portion which can partly be explained by a lower share 
of working-age population in total population and a 
relatively high proportion of expenditure on pensions 
in total public non-health social protection expenditure. 
The remainder of this chapter is divided into four 
sections, dealing respectively with the areas of social se-
curity that are most relevant to people of working age, 
namely:
•  unemployment benefits;
•  employment injury benefits;
•  disability benefits;
•  maternity protection.

Many countries have already put in place or are de-
signing new schemes that are broader in scope and less 
closely focused on the occurrence of specific contin-
gencies. In many cases, national social security systems 
combine contributory schemes with non-contributory 
schemes in order to extend social protection to those 
with no or weak contributory capacities. Together, 
these schemes contribute to building national social 
protection floors and national social security systems.

3  This also includes expenditure on general social assistance programmes, which accounts for 0.8 per cent of GDP worldwide (2.7 per cent 
in Latin America).

3.2   Unemployment protection

KEY MESSAGES
 n Where they exist, unemployment benefit schemes play a key role in providing income security to 
workers and their families in the event of temporary unemployment, thereby contributing to preventing 
poverty; supporting structural change in the economy; providing safeguards against informalization; 
and, in the event of a crisis, stabilizing aggregate demand, helping the economy to recover more quickly. 
 n Only 28 per cent of the global labour force is potentially eligible for benefits (contributory or non-
contributory) under existing legislation in case of unemployment. Within this overall figure, regional 
differences are considerable: 80 per cent of the labour force is so covered in Europe, 38 per cent 
in Latin America, 21 per cent in the Middle East, 17 per cent in the Asia and Pacific region, and 
8 per cent in Africa.

 n Only 12 per cent of unemployed workers worldwide actually receive unemployment benefits, and 
again regional differences are large, with effective coverage ranging from 64 per cent of unemployed 
workers in Western Europe to just over 7 per cent in the Asia and Pacific region, 5 per cent in Latin 
America and the Caribbean and less than 3 per cent in the Middle East and Africa. 

 n A growing number of countries are extending the scope of protection offered under unemployment 
benefit schemes by including employment promotion measures such as skills development and 
employment services as part of the package, in combination with unemployment cash benefits.

 n Linking employment and social protection policies, by combining cash transfers with public employment 
programmes (employment guarantee schemes), vocational training and/or support for entrepreneurship, 
offers new possibilities for providing income security to unemployed and underemployed workers in 
countries with high levels of informality.

3.2.1   Protecting incomes, cushioning 
demand shocks and facilitating 
structural change in the economy

Unemployment protection schemes provide income sup-
port over a determined period of time to unemployed 
people who are capable of working. Their objective is to 
provide at least partial income replacement for the loss 
of earnings resulting from temporary unemployment, 
enabling the beneficiary to maintain a certain standard 
of living during the transition period until he or she ob-
tains suitable employment (see ILO, 2010a, pp. 57–58) 
and, increasingly, also to provide support in finding 
employment through a range of promotional measures 
and services. Under most schemes, cash benefits are avail-
able only in cases of involuntary unemployment,4 and are 
restricted in duration (see box 3.1); under many schemes, 
they are combined with services such as support, coun-
selling and advice in looking for employment, and fa-
cilities for enhancing, updating and developing skills.
In “normal” times, such schemes aim to meet the 
needs of individuals whose job losses reflect basic levels 
of turnover in the labour market, and thus to play a 

key role in supporting job mobility and facilitating 
structural change in the economy. In addition to guar-
anteeing income security for unemployed workers, un-
employment protection schemes can also help protect 
them from slipping into informality, and support their 
search for new jobs in which they can apply existing or 
new skills in a productive way. 

The repercussions for employment of the global 
crisis of 2008–09 have highlighted the wider role of 
unemployment benefits in helping both people and 
economies to adjust to shocks and to structural changes 
in the economy. Indeed, following sharp increases in 
unemployment rates in many parts of the world in the 
wake of the global crisis (ILO, 2013c), unemployment 
protection schemes have proved more important than 
ever both in providing income security to individuals 
and households and, by stabilizing aggregate demand, 
in fostering rapid recovery from the crisis. 

Whether temporary unemployment is the result of 
covariant shocks, as in the event of the global crisis, or 
of the constant structural change undergone by econ-
omies and labour markets, unemployment benefits rep-
resent an effective tool to guarantee income security to 

4  Involuntary unemployment excludes cases where an employee leaves a job of her or his own volition, without just cause (e.g. harassment, 
resignation under threat), or where the employee has deliberately contributed to her or his own dismissal.

30

Box 3.1  International standards on unemployment protection 

Giving effect to the right to social security enshrined in various international human rights instruments 
requires that effective social protection be guaranteed in the event of unemployment. Unemployment is 
recognized in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 1948 (UDHR) as one of the contingencies to be 
covered by national social security systems (Art. 25(1)). The right to access and maintain benefits, in cash 
or in kind, without discrimination, to secure protection from, among other things, unemployment, is consid-
ered as forming part of the right to social security as laid down in the International Covenant on Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights, 1966 (Art. 9) (see also UN, 2008, paras 2 and 16). 

ILO Conventions and Recommendations take a broad approach to unemployment protection by setting 
standards for the provision of cash benefits and services during periods of unemployment involving a suspen-
sion of earnings, thereby giving practical guidance for the implementation of the right to social security. Their 
objective is twofold: to ensure that individuals enjoy income security despite the loss of earnings suffered as 
a result of unemployment, and to support beneficiaries in finding productive and freely chosen employment. 
The Social Security (Minimum Standards) Convention, 1952 (No. 102), requires the provision of cash 
benefits to unemployed persons capable of and available for work but unable to obtain suitable employment. 
It sets qualitative and quantitative benchmarks that must be met, at a minimum, (1) to ensure the coverage 
of a substantial amount of the population, (2) to ensure that the level of cash benefits represents at least 
a certain percentage of beneficiaries’ former earnings and are thus deemed sufficient to serve as income 
replacement, or that they are sufficient to allow beneficiaries and their families to enjoy decent standards of 
living and health (see Annex III), and (3) to ensure that cash benefits are provided for a period of time that 
is long enough for them to serve their purpose.

The Employment Promotion and Protection against Unemployment Convention, 1988 (No. 168), in-
creases the level and scope of protection that should be provided to the unemployed. In addition to full un-
employment, it covers partial unemployment (i.e. temporary reduction in the number of working hours) and 
temporary suspension of work, as well as part-time work for those who are seeking full-time work. It also re-
quires the provision of social benefits to certain categories of persons who have never been, or have ceased 
to be, recognized as unemployed or covered by unemployment protection schemes (e.g. new entrants to 
the labour market, those previously self-employed, etc.). Convention No. 168 further expands the scope of 
support that should be provided to the unemployed by calling upon the combination of cash benefits with 
measures that promote job opportunities and employment assistance (e.g. employment services, vocational 
training and guidance), prioritizing support to disadvantaged persons. Its accompanying Recommendation, 
No. 176, provides guidance on how to assess the suitability of employment for those seeking it, taking into 
account the age of unemployed persons, their length of service in their former occupation, their acquired 
experience, the length of their unemployment and the state of the labour market. 

The Social Protection Floors Recommendation, 2012 (No. 202), guides countries in defining and guaran-
teeing basic income security, at least at a nationally defined minimum level, to all persons of working age 
who are unable to earn sufficient income, for reasons including unemployment, as part of a national social 
protection floor. Such guarantee should be provided at least to all residents, and may be furnished through 
a variety of means including universal schemes, social insurance, social assistance, negative income tax, 
and/or public employment and employment support programmes. In a spirit similar to that of Convention 
No. 168, it recommends that the design and implementation of social protection floor guarantees combine 
preventive, promotional and active measures; that they promote productive economic activity and formal 
employment through labour market policies and policies that promote education, vocational training, pro-
ductive skills and employability; and that they are well coordinated with other policies that enhance formal 
employment, income generation, education, literacy, vocational training, skills and employability, that reduce 
precariousness, and that promote secure work, entrepreneurship and sustainable enterprises within a de-
cent work framework.

individuals, smooth economic changes and stabilize ag-
gregate consumption. 

Most unemployment benefit programmes are de-
signed to cover workers in formal employment who 
lose their jobs and find themselves temporarily unable 
to obtain suitable new employment. Most such pro-
grammes do not protect unemployed people who have 
had no formal employment in the recent past, the long-
term unemployed, the underemployed or the working 
poor. 

In countries with high levels of informality, wider 
non-contributory social assistance programmes com-
bining employment and social protection policies have 
been developed to provide some income security for 
unemployed and underemployed workers. These in-
clude employment guarantee schemes and other public 
employment programmes, as well as programmes that 
combine cash transfers with support for skills develop-
ment and creation of employment and entrepreneurship 
opportunities. 

World Social Protection Report 2014/153.2.2   Types of unemployment 

protection schemes

Countries use different contributory or non-contribu-
tory mechanisms of unemployment protection, or com-
binations thereof (figure 3.3). The main types may be 
summarized as follows.

Contributory unemployment benefit schemes.  These 
most commonly take the form of social insurance (un-
employment insurance), financed by contributions paid 
by employers, or shared between employers and employ-
ees, and usually cover workers in formal employment, 
on whose behalf regular contributions can be collected.5 
Unemployment insurance schemes have strong merits 
in terms of solidarity-based risk-sharing, their capacity 
to provide benefits in the form of periodical payments, 
and their potential to act across national economies as 
automatic stabilizers. 

Non-contributory unemployment benefit schemes. 
These are often referred to as unemployment assistance, 

3. Social protection for women and men of working age 

are usually funded at least partially through general tax-
ation, and tend to provide a lower level of benefits than 
insurance schemes to unemployed workers who either 
do not qualify for contributory benefits (e.g. because of 
a short contribution period) or have exhausted their en-
titlement to unemployment insurance benefit.

Social security systems providing both contribu-
tory and non-contributory unemployment benefits 
are closely aligned with the fundamental framework 
of ILO standards, which stipulates that risk should 
be shared on a collective basis and contribution pay-
ments organized accordingly. These benefits are also 
in nearly all cases combined with measures to facili-
tate a rapid return to employment and/or upgrading of 
skills, thereby embodying the combination of income 
replacement and employment promotion that lies at 
the core of Convention No. 168 and Recommendations 
Nos 176 and 202 (see box 3.1).

ingly called unemployment insurance savings accounts

5  While in most countries unemployment insurance is mandatory, voluntary unemployment protection schemes exist in several 
Scandinavian countries, where unemployment protection has traditionally been provided by trade unions and is supplemented by 
non-contributory schemes.

or UISA) require workers to accumulate savings in 
individual accounts, which provide for a stream of 
income in case of unemployment. Schemes of this type 
lack the key design element of risk-pooling; as a result, 
when an individual’s savings run out, so does her or 
his income protection – and this may happen quickly. 
In addition, those workers who will be able to save 
most in their individual accounts tend to be the ones 
least prone to the risk of unemployment, while those at 
highest risk tend to have difficulties in building up suf-
ficiently high savings to generate a significant income. 
So it cannot be said that such schemes either provide 
the same level of individual protection offered by social 
insurance schemes or are capable of acting as automatic 
stabilizers of aggregate demand in the same way. In 
addition, where such schemes allow borrowing from 
pension accounts, the result may be seriously reduced 
income security in old age. 

Employment guarantee schemes.  These provide a 
legal entitlement to employment in public works and 
cash transfers to poor workers in rural settings, and 

constitute one of the policy options that can be used 
to enhance income security for the working poor and 
employability. The largest and most closely studied 
scheme of this type is the Mahatma Gandhi National 
Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) 
in India (see box 3.3). Ethiopia, too, has implemented a 
large-scale programme which, although not providing a 
legally guaranteed income, combines public works with 
food and cash benefits: the Productive Safety Nets Pro-
gramme (PSNP).

Severance pay.  In many countries, this is the only 
form of income protection available to workers dis-
missed from certain forms of formal employment. This 
type of compensation, however, should be seen as rep-
resenting a form of deferred pay or enforced savings by 
workers, rather than a form of social risk- sharing. It 
offers little help to the unemployed in terms of help-
ing them back to work, or to employers who may need 
to make structural changes to their businesses, and 
may indeed have negative effects.6 For this reason, 
unemployment benefits – generally in the form of 

6  In imposing an obligation to pay laid-off workers a lump sum proportionate to their prior job tenure, severance pay may pose a high 
burden on employers, especially those in economic difficulties, and is therefore prone to evasion and poor enforcement. Many employers that 
go bankrupt face difficulties in finding the severance payments due to their dismissed workers. Thus, severance pay cannot be considered as a 
substitute for periodic unemployment benefits (see ILO, 2010a; Holzmann et al., 2011; Sarra, 2008).

World Social Protection Report 2014/15periodic payments – are considered more supportive of 
structural transformation in the economy than sever-
ance pay.

Not all of these different mechanisms of unemploy-
ment protection provide a clearly defined legal entitle-
ment to a periodic unemployment benefit, setting out 
eligibility conditions, the nature and level of the benefit, 
the duration of payment, and obligations with regard to 
jobseeking and the acceptance of a suitable job. 

At present, the majority (112 countries; 56 per cent) 
of the 201 countries reviewed in this report have no 
unemployment benefit scheme anchored in national 
legislation. However, 31 of these countries provide sev-
erance payment for workers covered by the labour code, 
which provides a limited level of protection to some 
workers.

Of the 89 countries (44 per cent) that have legis-
lative provision for some sort of social security bene-
fits in case of unemployment, more than 95 per cent 
(85 countries) provide periodic cash benefits to un-
employed persons meeting the prescribed qualifying 
conditions. Public social insurance is by far the most 
common mechanism used to provide such regular 
income replacement. Social insurance, subsidized vol-
untary insurance or mandatory private insurance are

complemented in one-third of these 89 countries by 
social assistance when rights to insurance payments 
have been exhausted or are not met. A few countries, 
including Australia, New Zealand and the Seychelles, 
provide only non-contributory benefits.

Contributory or non-contributory unemployment 
benefit schemes are predominantly to be found in ad-
vanced economies, but schemes providing for some 
form of unemployment benefits have also been intro-
duced in middle-income countries (see figure 3.4). 

3.2.3   Legal coverage for  

unemployment benefits 

Figure 3.5 sets out the overall picture as to the propor-
tion of the labour force protected by unemployment 
protection schemes according to national legislation 
(legal coverage ratio).

At  the  global  level,  only  28.1  per  cent  of  the 
labour force is potentially eligible for unemployment 
benefit under existing national legislation, providing 
the fact that the laws are properly implemented and 
enforced. This proportion is based on a broad defin-
ition including mandatory unemployment insurance,

and 3.4). The variation between regions is consider-
able (see figures 3.5 and 3.6): while 80–90 per cent of 
the labour force in North America and Europe is cov-
ered by law by an unemployment benefit scheme, only 
37.6 per cent of the labour force in Latin America is so 
protected, along with 20.6 per cent of the labour force 
in the Middle East, 16.6 per cent in the Asia and Pa-
cific region,7 and just 8.4 per cent of the labour force in 
Africa. Where coverage is low, this is usually because 
unemployment benefit schemes do not exist and, where 
they do exist, usually cover only those working in the 
formal economy. There are marked gender differences 
in unemployment protection coverage in some regions, 
especially the Middle East, where only 17.7 per cent of 
the female labour force is protected by law, compared 
to 20.6 per cent of the total labour force, and in North 
Africa, where 20.9 per cent of the female labour force is 
protected, compared to 27 per cent of the overall labour 
force.

3.2.4   Effective coverage  

by unemployment benefits 

Unemployment benefits play a key role in ensuring 
income security for unemployed workers and in fa-
cilitating their transition to new jobs, particularly if 
properly linked to employment services. However, the 
proportion of jobseekers receiving unemployment bene-
fits varies widely across and within regions. The extent 
and level of effective coverage of unemployment benefit 
schemes can be measured by relating the number of 
actual recipients of such benefits to the number of un-
employed workers at a given point in time.

What is observed, not surprisingly, is that effective 
coverage by unemployment benefits is lower than legal 
coverage,8 and that this varies widely across regions and 
countries (see figures 3.7 and 3.8). While 63.8 per cent 
of the unemployed in Western Europe (in some coun-
tries, more than 90 per cent) receive unemployment 
benefits, including non-contributory benefits, only 
21.6 per cent of unemployed workers in Central and 
Eastern Europe and 28 per cent of the unemployed in 

7  This includes an estimate of legal coverage for India’s employment guarantee scheme, which is based on an estimate of the proportion of 
working or unemployed adults in the total rural labour force.
8  It should be noted that indicators for legal and effective coverage are not strictly comparable, as they refer to two different dimensions 
of coverage and different reference populations (denominators). The legal coverage indicator refers to people eligible under legislation for 
unemployment benefits as a proportion of the total labour force. The effective coverage indicator refers to the proportion of those receiving 
unemployment benefits as a proportion of those currently unemployed.

North America do so. Only a small minority of un-
employed workers in many developing countries can 
expect to receive any kind of cash unemployment pro-
tection benefits: 7.2 per cent of unemployed workers in 
Asia and the Pacific, 4.6 per cent in Latin America and 
the Caribbean, and less than 3 per cent in the Middle 
East, North Africa and sub-Saharan Africa. Across the 
world, only 11.7 per cent of the unemployed receive un-
employment benefits, while the remaining 88.3 per cent 
are left without income support. 

While the lack of an unemployment protection 
scheme is certainly the major reason for the low cov-
erage in global terms, other factors include long con-
tribution periods,9 and a short maximum duration of 
payment.10 

In most regions – with the notable exception of 
Latin America – effective coverage rates have fallen 
since 2007 (see figure 3.7). This decrease may be due 
to changes in the structure of the unemployed popu-
lation (for example, more first-time jobseekers or long-
term unemployed) or changes in entitlement rules in 
unemployment benefit schemes. In Europe and North 
America, factors contributing to the steep rise in cov-
erage rates between 2007 and 2009 are likely to have 
included more generous rules with regard to eligibility 
for unemployment benefits and a higher proportion 
of new beneficiaries. The subsequent dramatic fall in 
effective coverage ratios in these regions by 2012 may 
be attributed to a higher share of long-term unemploy-
ment and a consequently higher share of unemployed 
having exhausted their entitlement to unemployment 
benefit.

Figures 3.7–3.9 indicate that in many countries with 
unemployment benefit schemes in place, only a relatively 
small proportion of the unemployed actually receive pe-
riodic unemployment cash benefits.11 Coverage ratios of 
more than two-thirds of the unemployed are reached 
in only nine out of the 89 countries that have schemes 
of some type in place. Several factors may contribute 
to low effective coverage rates. A high proportion of 

9  Conventions Nos 102 and 168 both require that the qualifying period 
be no longer than necessary to preclude abuse. Countries usually require 
either six or 12 months of contributions to qualify. Mongolia has the 
highest requirement, at 24 months of contributions, the last nine of 
which must be continuous, thereby excluding those with seasonal or 
temporary work contracts (Carter, Bédard and Peyron Bista, 2013).
10  While the duration of protection varies widely, on average the 
maximum duration for benefit is 45 weeks (55 weeks in advanced 
economies; 17 weeks in Latin American countries).
11  Some of those not covered by unemployment benefit schemes may, 
however, receive other benefits, such as general social assistance benefits.

unemployed workers may belong to categories often 
excluded from legal coverage, such as domestic workers 
or part-time workers. A high share of long-term un-
employed who have exhausted their benefit entitlement 
can also lower the coverage ratio. Other groups may be 
excluded from effective coverage because they do not 
meet the entitlement conditions, such as unemployed 
people (often young people or other workers with short 
and/or interrupted employment careers) who have not 
accumulated a sufficient contribution or employment 
record to be eligible for contributory unemployment 
benefits, or, in the case of means-tested benefits, whose 
own means are above the threshold set for eligibility for 
benefits. 

High coverage rates of unemployment benefits are 
associated with higher income security for beneficiaries, 
provided that benefit levels are adequate. Unemploy-
ment benefits play a major role in preventing poverty 
for the unemployed, as shown by figure 3.10 for the 
Member States of the European Union. In countries 
where effective coverage rates of unemployment bene-
fits are lower, the unemployed are more likely to live in 
poverty. 

Evidence from the European Union also demon-
strates that unemployed workers receiving unemploy-
ment benefits are more likely to return to work than 
those who do not receive any benefits (European Com-
mission, 2014b, p. 163). Unemployment protection 
thus plays a key role in facilitating transitions back into 
employment and preventing poverty.

3.2.5   Unemployment protection for young people

Unemployment protection for young people constitutes 
a particular challenge, exacerbated by the high, and 
often growing, unemployment rates of young people 
in many countries (ILO, 2013d). The fact that very 
large numbers of young people around the world are 
unable to gain access to labour markets constitutes an 
important problem in itself (ILO, 2012b). Many as-
pects of this problem, moreover, bring into sharp focus 
specific issues in relation to the objectives, design and 
implementation of unemployment protection schemes 
more generally. 

Only a small number of countries (20 out of the 
201 reviewed for this report) provide unemployment 
benefits for first-time jobseekers, a category of the active 
population by definition excluded from the protection 
conferred by unemployment protection schemes based 
on contributory coverage. In some countries, first-time 
jobseekers may be eligible for some form of unemploy-
ment assistance; in others, they may have access to non-
contributory benefits provided through, for example, a 
general social assistance programme. In most countries, 
however, first-time jobseekers do not fall within the 
remit of any social security schemes.

Even in systems where young unemployed women 
and men who have already acquired some work ex-
perience may be eligible for some contributory un-
employment insurance benefits, they remain less likely 
to be eligible for such benefits than older adults, for

two reasons. First, minimum contribution periods in 
contributory unemployment insurance programmes 
effectively exclude young adults who are made redun-
dant before meeting these minimum contribution pe-
riods. Second, young people are more likely to work in 
conditions which are not covered by unemployment 
insurance, including employment on temporary and 
part-time contracts, or in other forms of precarious or 
informal employment (see figure 3.11). 

Many countries have strengthened their efforts 
to combine income support benefits with assistance 
in finding new employment, training, retraining and 
other measures aimed at increasing employability. 
These include specific programmes addressing youth 
unemployment, including increasing the quality of ap-
prenticeship systems and other school-to-work tran-
sition programmes, providing career guidance and 
introducing measures to support the acquisition of 
work experience.

One of the most remarkable policy developments in 
recent years is the strengthening of unemployment pro-
tection policies in emerging economies, in response to 
the need both to provide income security for individual 
unemployed workers and protect them from slipping 
into the informal economy, and to safeguard the na-
tion’s human capital (see e.g. Berg and Salerno, 2008). 
Several distinct forms of protection have emerged, in-
cluding various types of unemployment insurance and 
assistance, and employment guarantee schemes. These 
different forms respond to different needs and contexts, 
and provide different levels of protection. 

In some middle-income countries with high level of 
informal employment and weak employment services, 
unemployment savings schemes (see section 3.2.2 above) 
have been promoted, following the example of Chile.12 
It has been argued that in such contexts individual ac-
counts are less prone to moral hazard than collectively fi-
nanced unemployment insurance schemes.13 The Chilean 
scheme partially addresses the inability of many workers 
to build up sufficiently high savings – one of the major 
shortcomings of this type of programme – through a 
tax-subsidized solidarity component, which effectively 
makes it a hybrid scheme. Some similar programmes, 
however (for example in Jordan), lack this component, 
instead allowing account-holders to tap into their pen-
sion entitlements, which effectively perpetuates income 
insecurity into old age. Experience from Chile shows 
that coverage remains low and is of greatest benefit to 
those at lowest risk of becoming unemployed while not 
sufficiently protecting those at greatest need; moreover, 
replacement rates tend to be insufficient to provide even 
a minimum level of income security (OECD, 2010a). 
These difficulties raise fundamental questions as to the 
viability of such programmes, unless supported by a large 
tax-funded solidarity component.14

A growing number of emerging economies have 
chosen instead in recent years to introduce or signifi-
cantly expand contributory or non-contributory un-
employment benefit schemes. These include Bahrain,15 

12  Chile’s Seguro de Cesantía scheme was introduced in 2002 (see Sehnbruch, 2006; Chile Superintendencia de Pensiones, 2010).
13  Proponents of unemployment savings accounts (e.g. Vodopivec, 2009; Robalino, Vodopivec and Bodor, 2010) argue that the fact that 
they require the unemployed to draw on their own savings, rather than offering access to a collectively financed unemployment fund, limits 
moral hazard in contexts where government authorities do not have the capacity to prevent abuse.
14  Such a solidarity component would introduce through the back door the very risk of moral hazard that these schemes are supposed to 
minimize, thereby severely detracting from their purported advantages.
15  Bahrain introduced a contributory unemployment benefit scheme in 2006, providing earnings-related benefits to the insured and flat-
rate benefits to first-time jobseekers and those lacking a sufficient contribution record.

World Social Protection Report 2014/153. Social protection for women and men of working age 

Box 3.2  Public employment programmes and their contribution to social protection

Public  employment  programmes  (PEPs),  a  term  used  to  describe  any  programme  involving  direct 
employment creation by government, are often used as one component of national social protection strat-
egies. Among a broad variety of PEPs, two specific forms stand out:
•  Public works programmes (PWPs), which may offer cash payments or food for work. This more common 
and traditional form is often adopted as a temporary response to specific shocks and crises, but may also 
have a longer-term horizon. 

•  Employment guarantee schemes (EGSs) refer to long-term rights-based programmes in which some level 

of entitlement to work is provided. 

While PEPs can contribute to several development objectives, they are not able to serve all objectives to the 
same extent at the same time. In practice, the policy design and implementation requires the prioritization 
of one function over others, along the following lines:
•  Employment function: emphasis on job creation in programmes that focus on the State as the employer 

of last resort.

•  Social protection function: emphasis on income security and transfers in cash or in kind.
•  Labour-based investment function: emphasis on the quality and nature of infrastructure constructed or 

services provided.

Where the main priority is not clearly defined, the monitoring and evaluation of a programme against its ob-
jectives will be hampered. It is therefore necessary to clearly define, separate and articulate the objectives 
of a programme, and to link it effectively to other employment and social protection policies. 

Employment guarantee schemes can contribute to building national social protection floors in several 
respects. They can enhance income security for people of working age with no or insufficient earnings, by 
providing income that is regular and predictable and is provided as an entitlement. They can also be used to 
construct or improve infrastructure that enhances the supply of health, education and other public services. 
However, these schemes do not address all needs, given that the central element of employment excludes 
those who are not able to work, for whatever reason. Some PEPs (e.g. in Ethiopia and India) therefore 
combine employment guarantee schemes with cash transfers for those who are permanently or temporarily 
unable to work, or for whom work is not available.

Mauritius,16 Saudi Arabia17 and Viet Nam.18 While 
these had been planned before the global crisis, their 
timely implementation was very helpful in coping with 
its repercussions. In each of these countries, the dis-
bursement of unemployment benefits is closely linked 
to the provision of employment services that support 
jobseekers in finding a new job or acquiring new skills. 
Other emerging economies have expanded cover-
age of their unemployment insurance schemes to cover 
workers at the margins of the formal economy. The Bra-
zilian unemployment insurance scheme now covers not 
only waged workers, including domestic workers, but 
also small-scale fishermen, workers rescued from forced 
labour and workers in the Bolsa Qualificação (train-
ing scholarship) programme. In South Africa, domestic 

workers were brought under the umbrella of unemploy-
ment insurance in 2003. 

Employment guarantee schemes and other forms 
of public employment programmes (see box 3.2) have 
emerged as a further policy option to provide temporary 
employment and a certain level of income security to 
rural populations during lean seasons when many rural 
workers are unemployed or underemployed. India’s 
MGNREGS, introduced in 2005, provides a legally 
guaranteed right to a maximum of 100 days of employ-
ment a year to rural households (see box 3.3). Many 
other countries have been using public employment 
programmes to provide poor people with some level of 
income security at least for a limited period of time, al-
though this is usually not based on a legal entitlement. 

16  Mauritius complemented its unemployment assistance scheme with a social insurance scheme in 2009.
17  Saudi Arabia’s Hafiz programme, implemented in December 2011, provides financial assistance of up to 2,000 riyal (SAR) a month to 
jobseekers and offers a broad range of placement and upskilling services.
18  Viet Nam introduced an employment insurance scheme in 2009, following the adoption of the Law on Social Insurance in 2006. The 
scheme is now being converted into an Employment Insurance scheme, expanding the scope of employment promotion measures provided 
in combination with cash benefits.

Box 3.3  India’s Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) 

The MGNREGS was established under the corresponding Act (the National Rural Employment Guarantee 
Act: NREGA), adopted in 2005. Reflecting the constitutional right to work, the scheme confers legal rights 
on beneficiaries, which distinguishes it from programmes that are not anchored in national legislation and 
are therefore prone to discretionary changes. There are, however, some concerns that poor, often illiterate, 
households cannot realize their rights in practice. 

Under the MGNREGS, a rural household is entitled to demand up to 100 days of employment per year, 
which is made available on agreed public works sites. A share of places in this programme is reserved for 
women. The programme undertakes projects facilitating land and water resource management, together with 
infrastructure development projects such as road construction. The programme is designed to be self-targeting, 
with wages equal to the prevailing, officially declared, minimum wage for agricultural labourers in the area. If 
work is not provided within the stipulated time, the applicant is entitled to receive an unemployment allowance. 
The allocation for the programme from the national budget for the financial year 2012/13 was equivalent to 
0.3 per cent of GDP. The programme is acknowledged as one of the largest rights-based integrated employment 
and social protection initiatives in the world, reaching close to 50 million rural households –  approximately 
30 per cent of rural households – in 2012.

While the possibility of using public employment 
programmes to pursue simultaneously a multiplicity 
of objectives (investment, employment and social pro-
tection) renders them an attractive tool, the concomi-
tant lack of a clearly defined primary objective can limit 
their effectiveness in fulfilling social protection objec-
tives (e.g. ILO, 2014b; Lieuw-Kie-Song et al., 2011; 
McCord, 2012; Subbarao et al., 2013). Nevertheless, 
several countries (including Ethiopia and South Africa) 
have taken deliberate steps to emphasize social protec-
tion objectives in their public employment programmes 
(McCord, 2012). Public employment programmes will 
only help to alleviate poverty in the long term if they 
are designed to provide decent work, including an ad-
equate level of wages, an integral skills development 
component and full respect for the occupational safety 
and health of workers, while also ensuring beneficiaries 
are covered by existing social security schemes and pro-
vided with access to health care.

3.2.7   Unemployment benefits as a key  

element of crisis response  
and fiscal consolidation measures

During the recent global crisis, many countries ben-
efited from the capacity of unemployment benefit 
schemes to stabilize aggregate demand, and thus foster 
quick recovery (ILO 2011a; IILS, 2011c), in line with 
the Global Jobs Pact (ILO, 2009a; ECOSOC, 2009). 

Countries that had unemployment benefit schemes in 
place before the crisis were able to scale them up quickly 
to enhance their power as automatic stabilizers. Where 
partial unemployment benefits were available to com-
pensate for crisis-induced reductions in working hours, 
they helped workers to keep their jobs, and employers to 
retain their workforces, during troughs in demand, and 
supported a rapid response to the first signs of recovery 
(ILO, 2011a; IILS, 2011c). A number of countries im-
plemented these and other expansionary measures at a 
relatively early stage of the financial crisis. As the crisis 
continued and pressures on public budgets increased, 
some of these expansionary measures gave way to fiscal 
consolidation measures.19 

Expansionary measures: Using unemployment 
benefits to ensure income security  
for the unemployed and to preserve  
jobs for the employed 

Extension of coverage and increase in the level and dur-
ation of benefit.  Several countries facilitated or ex-
tended access to existing or new unemployment benefits 
in response to the global crisis (ILO and World Bank, 
2012; Bonnet, Saget and Weber, 2012). Some countries, 
such as Australia, reduced the waiting period for un-
employment benefits; others, such as Latvia, reduced 
the length of the period of contributions required to 
be eligible for benefits. Most countries extended cover-
age to workers previously excluded, such as non-regular

Box 3.4  Keeping people in employment through part-time unemployment benefits: 

The example of Germany

Germany’s part-time unemployment benefit (Kurzarbeitergeld or short-time work compensation), was one of 
the country’s main policy instruments during the global financial and economic crisis. This benefit allowed 
companies faced with a drop in demand to retain workers on shorter working hours while guaranteeing 
them at least a degree of income security. Partial compensation for their loss in direct earnings was made 
through a cash benefit paid for a maximum period of six months. At the peak of the crisis, in May 2009, 
these benefits were being paid to around 1.5 million workers (5.4 per cent of the workforce). 

As a result, the sudden downturn of the economy led to only a moderate increase in the number of un-
employed and the number of recipients of unemployment insurance benefits, the employment impact of the 
downturn being largely cushioned by the remarkable expansion of partial unemployment benefits.

This policy is considered to be one of the factors explaining the relatively quick recovery of the German 
economy, because it ensured that employers were in a position to retain their workers throughout the crisis, 
thus avoiding firing and rehiring costs, and were able to respond quickly as the markets picked up again. The 
average reduction in working time was 30.5 per cent, the equivalent of about 432,000 full-time jobs. A loss of 
jobs of this magnitude would have resulted in an increase in the unemployment rate of about 1 percentage point.

workers in Germany and Japan, the self-employed in 
Austria, and young people in Argentina (Bonnet, Saget 
and Weber, 2012). Other countries extended the dur-
ation of coverage to ensure inclusion of those who 
would otherwise be deemed to have exhausted their 
rights (these included Argentina, Brazil,20 Japan,21 
Latvia,22 Spain23 and, in the case of older workers, Uru-
guay24), or provided emergency benefits to this group 
(for example, the United States25). Another strategy fol-
lowed by some countries (for example, India and South 
Africa)was to use public employment programmes as 
a means to ensure a predictable income stream for un-
employed and underemployed workers. Finally, some 
countries (for example, France and the United King-
dom) increased the level of benefits or provided one-
off benefit payments to some categories of unemployed 
workers.

Keeping people in employment.  Several countries 
(including Canada,26 France, Germany (see box 3.4), 

the Netherlands and Poland) used partial unemploy-
ment benefits to allow employers to retain workers 
during the trough in demand. Various social dialogue 
instruments, especially tripartite cooperation and col-
lective bargaining, were used to shape these policies. 
Partial unemployment benefits helped not only to con-
tain the rise in unemployment and the number of re-
cipients of (full) unemployment benefits, but also to 
keep experienced workers in place so that their employ-
ers could take prompt advantage of the eventual upturn 
(see  Bonnet,  Saget  and  Weber,  2012;  ILO,  2010a 
(pp. 106–111); ILO, 2011a; Arpaia et al., 2010). Such 
measures are widely considered to have been successful 
in fostering quick economic recovery and preventing 
the  “dequalification” and discouragement of workers. 
Other countries (for example, China) introduced or ex-
tended programmes that aimed at upgrading the skills 
of employed workers and workers in vulnerable situ-
ations (Aleksynska et al., 2013). 

20  In 2009, a temporary increase was implemented in the maximum duration of unemployment benefits for sectors hit particularly badly by 
the recession. This extension reached around 103,000 people, or 20 per cent of those receiving unemployment benefits. Also, those lacking 
formal income-earning opportunities have been targeted through extended access to the Bolsa Família programme. The stabilization of 
aggregate consumption through this measure, together with other social security programmes and the minimum wage policy, is observed to 
have contributed substantially to accelerating recovery in Brazil (IILS, 2011b.)
21  At the end of 2008, Japan adopted a 60-day extension of the period during which unemployment benefits were payable to those who 
faced difficulty in finding re-employment (taking into consideration place of residence and age).
22  The duration of unemployment benefit payment in Latvia was temporarily increased (from 1 July 2009 to 31 December 2011) to nine 
months across the board.
23  This provision, introduced in Spain at the end of 2009 and extended in 2010, was complemented by measures to promote employability 
of the long-term unemployed involving their active participation.
24  Introduced in 2009: see Amarante, Arim and Dean, 2013.
25  The extension of Emergency Unemployment Compensation (EUC) in the United States began in June 2008 and expired on 1 January 2014.
26  Canada’s Work Sharing programme aimed at avoiding lay-offs by offering benefits from employment insurance to qualifying workers 
willing to work reduced hours while their employer recovers from adverse economic conditions.

Contraction measures: Tightening entitlement 
conditions for jobseekers’ access to benefits

While many countries took bold measures to expand 
unemployment benefit coverage in order to mitigate the 
effect of the crisis, others adopted fiscal consolidation 
measures even in the early stages of the global crisis. 
These included the tightening of entitlement conditions 
for unemployment benefits (for example, in Ireland, 
Ukraine and the United Kingdom), increases in the 
number of contribution payments required to qualify 
for the receipt of unemployment benefits (in Ireland 
and Switzerland), the introduction of a higher earnings 
threshold for eligibility (in Ireland), reductions in the 
maximum period for which benefits could be paid (in 
the Czech Republic, Portugal, Serbia and Switzerland), 
and reductions in the level of benefits (in Romania and 
Serbia) (see Bonnet, Saget and Weber, 2012). While 
such measures may have helped to contain the rising 
cost of unemployment benefits, they may have led con-
versely to an increase in expenditure on social assistance 
benefits. Reductions in the maximum duration of en-
titlements (as in the Czech Republic and Ireland) or 
in the level of benefits (in Hungary and Latvia) had a 
strong impact on both current recipients of unemploy-
ment benefits and the newly unemployed. 

Inevitably, the rise in unemployment rates led to a 
steep increase in the number of recipients of unemploy-
ment benefits, which rose on average by some 50 per 
cent between January 2008 and early 2009. In several 

42

countries, including Australia, New Zealand and the 
United States, the number of beneficiaries had roughly 
doubled by 2009 compared to pre-crisis levels. Since 
then, the number of beneficiaries has decreased, yet 
in most countries it still remains well above the levels 
of 2008. Considering the dim prospects for a global 
employment recovery (IMF, 2013a; ILO, 2014a), this 
situation is likely to continue. The expansion of un-
employment benefits in some countries, together with 
the rising numbers of beneficiaries, have led inevitably 
to an increase in expenditure on such schemes. In some 
countries the existing reserves in unemployment insur-
ance funds have been exhausted, necessitating budget 
allocations for tax-financed benefits. 

As a consequence, from 2010–11 more countries 
started implementing fiscal consolidation measures 
with the objective of redressing the financial situation 
of both unemployment insurance funds and public 
budgets. This included some countries (such as  Slovenia 
and Spain) which had taken bold measures to expand 
unemployment benefits at the onset of the crisis, but 
now felt the need to withdraw some of these expan-
sionary measures and curtail unemployment benefits 
(see box 3.5).

Several countries implemented measures which 
changed the rights and obligations of jobseekers with 
regard to accessing benefits. For example, Canada, 
Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States 
all strengthened the requirements of unemployment 
benefit recipients in respect of searching for work. 

Box 3.5  From expansion to fiscal consolidation: 

The examples of Slovenia and Spain 

In several countries, an initial expansion of unemployment benefits in response to the global crisis was later 
reversed with the objective of consolidating public finances.

In January 2011, the Slovenian government introduced the new Labour Market Regulation Act (LMRA) 
as a response to the economic crisis, aiming thereby “to increase the security of jobseekers, especially 
the security of unemployed persons and persons whose employment is at risk, through the government’s 
quicker response in the labour market”. However, measures adopted in 2013 as part of a Bill on Emer-
gency Measures, temporarily reduced the levels of unemployment cash benefits and maternity benefits for 
budgetary reasons. Unemployment cash benefits were reduced by 3 per cent to a monthly level no lower 
than €350 but no higher than €890 (the previous ceiling was €1,050). In addition, instead of unemployment 
benefits the long-term unemployed would receive wages and reimbursement of employment-related costs in 
exchange for their participation in public employment programmes.

In the early phase of the crisis, the Spanish government decided to extend unemployment protection tem-
porarily to those who had exhausted their eligibility to benefits and subsidies and were in need, due to lack 
of other income, with an allowance of €420 per month for a maximum period of six months in combination 
with measures to promote employability. More recently, various measures have been taken with a view to 
reducing expenditure, including lowering the level of contributory unemployment benefits after six months, 
increasing the minimum age of qualification for non-contributory unemployment benefits for the older 
unemployed, and introducing new requirements for the long-term unemployed and persons with disabilities 
with regard to the acceptance of offers of employment or training.

Measures to this end included a broader definition of 
suitable employment and stricter obligations for job-
seekers with regard to their efforts in actively looking 
for a new job (e.g. in Canada27), compulsory partici-
pation in training and other active labour market pro-
grammes for certain categories of the unemployed (e.g. 
in Brazil,28 Saudi Arabia,29 Spain, the United Kingdom, 
the United States and Uruguay30) and stricter sanctions 
for recipients who refuse an offer of suitable employ-
ment (e.g. Ireland31 and New Zealand32), as well as 
measures to enhance the effectiveness of employment 
services in getting people into employment and short-
ening the duration of unemployment claims (e.g. the 
United States33). 

The role of unemployment benefits during the 
global crisis has highlighted two major policy lessons. 
First, it has underscored the importance of having well-
designed unemployment benefit schemes in place which 
not only support the structural transformation of the 
economy in “normal” times, but can also be quickly 
scaled up in the event of major economic shocks in 
order to realize their full potential as automatic sta-
bilizers of aggregate demand. Second, unemployment 
benefit schemes can achieve their potential only if they 
are financed appropriately from contributions and gen-
eral taxation. Where financing is insufficient, ill-timed 
and ill-designed curtailments of benefits may have 
pro-cyclical effects, which may thwart economic re-
covery and lead to substantial increases in poverty and 
vulnerability. 

3.2.8   Renewed emphasis on (re-)integrating 

unemployed workers into the labour market

Some of the measures recently implemented aimed at 
(re-)integrating unemployed workers into the labour 
market, accelerating a trend that started well before 
the global crisis (e.g. Lødemel and Trickey, 2001; Eich-
horst, Kaufmann and Konle-Seidl, 2008). Some have 
been adopted as part of the crisis response, while others 
are not directly related to it. Aiming at better link-
ing “active” and “passive” labour market policies, some 
measures focus on encouraging unemployed workers 
to participate in training, job matching and subsidized 
employment programmes, while others are more coer-
cive in character. 

Many of the recent reforms have been aimed at pro-
moting and facilitating (re-)entry into employment 
for various specific groups, including the long-term 
unemployed, youth, single parents and persons with 
disabilities. Since 2010, most measures adopted in de-
veloped countries in particular have aimed at reducing 
unemployment by providing better support to the un-
employed to enter or re-enter employment and by stim-
ulating job creation. This is the case, for example, of 
measures introduced in pursuit of the objectives of the 
European Commission’s “Social Investment Package” 
(SIP) (European Commission, 2013a). In recent years, 
too, wage and job subsidies and credit provision have 
been initiated to encourage job creation in many coun-
tries, e.g. Argentina, Brazil, Canada, France, Russian 
Federation, Saudi Arabia, South Africa and the United 
States.

43

27  Changes introduced in the Canadian legal framework governing the employment insurance scheme included a clarification of the 
definition of “suitable employment” and of what constitutes a “reasonable job search” by those claiming unemployment benefits. The new 
definition of suitable employment widened the range of jobs that some beneficiaries (those with frequent unemployment spells) are required to 
accept, including jobs unrelated to previous fields of work, jobs paying 70 per cent of their former earnings and jobs entailing long commutes.
28  In Brazil, additional vocational training opportunities were created for beneficiaries of income transfer programmes, including those 
receiving unemployment benefits and transfers under the Bolsa Família programme.
29  In Saudi Arabia, a series of measures targeted the recipients of Hafiz: these included referral of hard-to-place beneficiaries to job 
placement centres, compulsory training, establishment of partnerships with private sector enterprises to provide training and employment 
opportunities for beneficiaries, and strengthened employment services (ILO and World Bank, 2012).
30  In Uruguay, increases in the amounts of benefit and the extension of duration of payment from six to eight months were accompanied by 
a new obligation to take training courses.
31  In Ireland, the conditionality of benefits was changed in the extended social welfare legislation that took effect from January 2011, 
stipulating disqualification for receipt of certain benefits (or reductions in payments) when a person refuses an offer of suitable employment 
or refuses to participate in an appropriate course of training or other support programme. Prior to this, the legislation required only that 
a recipient be seeking a job and be available for work, a provision that was applied in a somewhat benign manner (European Commission, 
2012b).
32  From July 2013, unemployed people in New Zealand have to comply with new conditions for the payment of benefits. If a suitable job 
is turned down without good reason, benefits may be reduced by half for unemployed with dependent children and for others stopped 
for 13 weeks. Other conditions include accepting (and passing) drug tests when applying for a job in certain sectors such as truck driving, 
construction and forestry; giving advance notice if leaving the country; and, for unemployed with children, meeting conditions with regard 
to children’s school attendance and parents’ childcare obligations.
33  A reform of the Re-employment Services (RES) and Re-employment and Eligibility Assessments (REA) programmes aimed at ensuring 
more rapid re-employment, shorter claim durations and fewer erroneous payments of unemployment compensation.

Box 3.6  Measures facilitating return to work for parents with young children

Several countries have taken measures to help parents (particularly mothers) with young children return to work. 
In Australia, a set of policy measures aimed at facilitating the (re-)entry into the labour market of single 
parents include more generous earnings disregards under various income support benefits, career counsel-
ling and enhanced childcare provision. 

In Japan, a programme which supports women looking for work while raising their children, for instance 
through offering childcare services and information services, was re-invigorated. In 2011, 69,000 women 
used the programme and successfully found jobs.

In Pakistan, in 2009, the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) was introduced. The programme 
supports women in poor households with a combined package of cash benefits (1,000 Pakistan rupees 
(PKR) per month: approximately US$12) and in-kind social services. In addition to extending health insur-
ance coverage to its beneficiaries (Waseela-e-Sehat), the programme provides vocational training opportun-
ities (Waseela-e-Rozgar) to every beneficiary and access to interest-free financial support (Waseela-e-Haq) 
for certain women receiving the monthly benefit. The BISP is now being implemented across the whole 
country, with special attention to remote areas.

In the Russian Federation, access to training programmes designed for jobseekers was extended to women 
on leave to care for a child under the age of three. In 2011, 26,200 women on leave benefited from these 
programmes, of whom 15,700 found jobs. Additional measures included the introduction of flexible forms of 
work, self-employment programmes for women, and pre-school education for children aged three to seven.

44

Many of these measures focus on linking the dis-
bursement of cash benefits to active labour market pol-
icies, such as programmes for the provision of training, 
skills development, better job-matching, or career guid-
ance and mentorship. These include efforts to provide 
jobseekers and recipients of unemployment benefits 
with better access to training, retraining, certification 
and job-matching (e.g. in the Russian Federation34 and 
Saudi Arabia), personalized support (e.g. in the United 
Kingdom35), training and subsidized employment op-
portunities (e.g. Saudi Arabia36), and support in comply-
ing with job-search and activity requirements (Spain), 

as well as specific measures to support young people 
(e.g. in Argentina), older workers (e.g. in Canada37) and 
other specific groups (e.g. in the United States38). In 
some countries (including Japan, Pakistan, and the Rus-
sian Federation), measures to facilitate the employment 
of parents, particularly women, with young children 
have been introduced (see box 3.6). 

Such policies have often been linked to broader 
efforts to provide an integrated package of “active” 
and “passive” labour market policies, or, more broadly, 
to offer integrated employment and social protection 
services (e.g. in Argentina,39 Brazil and Germany40). 

34  A programme was initiated in the Russian Federation in 2010 to provide jobseekers with professional training, retraining, advanced 
training and certification.
35  The United Kingdom’s Work Programme offers personalized support to jobseekers through public, private or voluntary sector providers, 
who are paid on the basis of employment and job retention results.
36  In Saudi Arabia, vocational training opportunities, specialized training and on-the-job training are provided through partnerships with 
private employers.
37  Canada’s Targeted Initiative for Older Workers helps unemployed older workers from small and vulnerable communities to upgrade their 
skills in order to go back to work.
38  The Veterans Retraining Assistance Program (VRAP) supports military veterans in getting back to work by supplying up to 12 months 
of training programmes.
39  The Argentinian Ministry of Employment and Labour implements several income transfers and support programmes to address the 
risks and consequences associated with unemployment and underemployment. The overall set of policies provides responses targeted at the 
specific needs of different groups. The contributory unemployment insurance programme (Seguro de Desempleo) provides some income 
compensation for formal employees who lose their jobs. As a complement, for formal employment, the programme for productive recovery 
(Programa de Recuperación Productiva) supports enterprises finding it difficult to retain jobs. In addition, for those not covered by the 
unemployment insurance programme and those who have exhausted their entitlement to benefits, the training and employment insurance 
scheme (Seguro de Capacitación y Empleo) provides vocational training and counselling through municipal employment offices. Also, the 
Interzafra programme facilitates transition between temporary or seasonal contracts by supporting workers with a cash allowance. Finally, 
the programme for more and better work for young people (Programa Jóvenes Más y Mejor Trabajo) aims at promoting social and labour 
market inclusion for young people through cash transfers, job counselling and educational support.
40  The so-called “Hartz reforms” in Germany, particularly the unifying of unemployment assistance with social assistance in 2005 for 
those beneficiaries who are deemed employable, aimed at providing an integrated set of benefits and services for jobseekers and enhancing 
employability for recipients of social assistance (see, e.g., Alber and Heisig, 2011; Clasen and Goerne, 2011).

World Social Protection Report 2014/15These integrated packages are aimed not only at re-
cipients of unemployment benefits, but also at bring-
ing recipients of other types of social assistance benefits 
under a common umbrella of activation policies (Clasen 
and Clegg, 2011). For example, Germany and France 
have implemented measures to combine unemployment 
benefits with social assistance for employable beneficiar-
ies, and to merge their administration with employment 
services into “one-stop shops”, with a stronger emphasis 
on decentralized services based on individualized “inclu-
sion contracts”.41 Such policies are particularly relevant 
in the context of high levels of long-term unemploy-
ment, taking into account that discouraged workers may 
cease to be registered with employment services. 

While such measures are intended to provide an in-
tegrated package of support to individuals, combining 
cash benefits with employment services, skills develop-
ment and psycho-social support where necessary, some 
concerns have been expressed that individualized inclu-
sion contracts may weaken social rights, if they lead to 
legal frameworks not being applied in a homogeneous 
manner (Künzel, 2011). 

Also, while participation in training, retraining and 
other similar measures is intended to facilitate a quicker 
return to employment, an expectation or requirement 
to participate can also mean stricter control in the pro-
vision of benefits and additional obligations for jobseek-
ers with regard to their entitlements to benefits. These 
measures may lead to the exclusion of, or discrimin-
ation against, certain groups of beneficiaries and the 
restriction of effective access to benefits. Careful design 
and implementation of activation measures is there-
fore necessary to ensure that these do not lead to un-
intended effects. 

3.2.9   Challenges

As highlighted in this section, unemployment protec-
tion plays a multiple role in guaranteeing income se-
curity for unemployed workers while also supporting 
the structural transformation of national economies and 
mitigating demand shocks. One of the lessons learned 
from the global crisis is the importance of having 
effective unemployment benefit systems in place prior to 
a crisis in order to ensure that these are fully functional 
as automatic stabilizers of aggregate demand in the event 

3. Social protection for women and men of working age 

of an economic downturn. However, a large number of 
countries lack effective unemployment benefit schemes 
and many others have schemes that provide only limited 
coverage. Consequently, the potential of such schemes 
to address employment shocks, as well as to support eco-
nomic change, remains largely unfulfilled. In view of 
this, it is all the more encouraging that unemployment 
protection schemes have been recently introduced in 
several emerging economies, and that other countries are 
considering similar reforms. At the same time, increased 
efforts are needed to introduce measures, where possible, 
to enhance the effectiveness of existing schemes and to 
strengthen their links with programmes that support 
entry or re-entry into employment, skills upgrading and 
other active labour market policies.

In order to improve protection in countries with 
a high proportion of informal employment, which is 
usually accompanied by large-scale structural under-
employment, it may be necessary to combine a variety of 
measures. These may include unemployment insurance 
alongside employment guarantee schemes and social 
assistance or other cash transfer programmes, depend-
ing on national context, which together can form an 
effective social protection floor for unemployed workers 
and their families, in accordance with Recommenda-
tion No. 202.

Unemployment  benefits  have  not  functioned 
alone in protecting incomes, promoting employment 
and enabling a quick recovery during the global crisis. 
Measures taken to strengthen other social security 
benefits, such as pensions, sickness benefits, social as-
sistance benefits and access to health care, also play an 
important role in softening the impact of the crisis on 
private households and economies alike. 

Coordination of unemployment protection with 
other social security policy areas is thus essential, as is 
coordination with employment and employment-re-
lated services. In order to be fully effective in supporting 
economic change and responses to shocks, unemploy-
ment benefits need to be complemented by training, re-
training and other active labour market policies. These 
opportunities should be available to recipients of un-
employment benefits as well as to non-recipients, and to 
all workers, whether in formal employment or operating 
in the informal economy. Effective coordination with 
such employment policies will enable unemployment 
benefits to fulfil their role in the most efficient way.

45

41  In Germany, since the reforms of 2005 (see note 40), the administration of these cash benefits is combined with employment services in job 
centres. Social assistance is now limited to those who are not employable, and is administered separately. In France, an active inclusion policy is 
followed through the Revenu de Solidarité Active (2009), whose administration and linkage with employment services is highly decentralized.

3.3   Employment injury protection

KEY MESSAGES
 n Worldwide, only 33.9 per cent of the labour 
force  is  covered  by  law  for  employment 
injury through mandatory social insurance. 
If voluntary social insurance coverage and 
employer liability provisions are included, 
39.4 per cent of the labour force is covered 
by law.

 n In practice, actual access to employment 
injury protection is even lower, largely owing 
to incomplete enforcement of the legislation 
in many countries.

 n The  low  coverage  of  employment  injury 
compensation  in  many  low-  and  middle-
income countries points to an urgent need 
to enhance working conditions in respect of 
occupational safety and health, as well as 
improving employment injury coverage for 
all workers, including those in the informal 
economy. 

 n As  more  countries  move  from  employer 
liability as the basis for employment injury 
protection to a mechanism based on social 
insurance, levels of protection for workers 
are likely to improve – but only if new laws 
are effectively enforced.

46

3.3.1   Protecting workers affected  

by employment injury

Employment injury benefit schemes, providing benefits 
in cash and in kind in cases of work-related accidents 
and occupational disease, constitute in many coun-
tries the oldest branch of social security. These schemes 
were established to address one of the key challenges in 
modern workplaces. As a corollary of their responsibil-
ity to ensure working conditions which secure the oc-
cupational safety and health of their workers, employers 
are responsible for ensuring fair, equitable and effective 
compensation of workers (and, in the event of death, of 
their survivors) for the loss of income suffered as a con-
sequence of an accident or occupational disease and for 
their access to the necessary health care (covering medi-
cal and allied care services and goods, including rehabil-
itation). Where such mechanisms are not in place, the 
only hope of redress for a person injured at work, or for 
her or his survivors, lies in action against the employer 

in the ordinary courts. Lawsuits of this type are gen-
erally lengthy, expensive and stressful for victims, and 
thus are rarely efficient in providing effective compensa-
tion to injured workers and the family or other depend-
ants of deceased workers.

Non-adversarial schemes were thus introduced in 
a number of countries at an early stage, with a view 
to ensuring the timely provision of benefits to injured 
workers and their dependants, the establishment of pre-
dictable and sustainable financing mechanisms, and 
the efficient administration of funds. The first gener-
ation of such schemes consisted in “workmen’s com-
pensation schemes”, under which the compensation of a 
worker or his/her surviving family dependants is a legal 
liability placed upon the employer. Underpinning this 
approach is the principle that employers must provide 
their workers with a safe and healthy working envir-
onment, and that failure to do so renders them liable for 
the consequent losses suffered by workers or their family 
members. Given that the financial burden of meeting 
this obligation rests solely on employers, these schemes 
often require them to take out private insurance. Ex-
perience has shown, however, that even where such an 
obligation exists in law, the outcomes of these schemes 
are often sub-optimal. The need to process an insur-
ance claim, involving the need to obtain relevant infor-
mation and undergo rigorous medical assessments, can 
cause serious delays in obtaining treatment and benefits. 
In addition, an employer may be reluctant to make a 
claim for fear of other legal implications. In recognition 
of these drawbacks, many countries have replaced em-
ployer liability provisions with social insurance, which 
in effect extends the no-fault principle to share the costs 
of employment injury across society (or at least that part 
represented in the formal labour market) as a whole.

This shift in approach to employment injury protec-
tion has been reflected in the standards adopted by the 
ILO from its early days (see box 3.7). 

The effectiveness of programmes in addressing the 
specific contingency of employment injury relies on a 
specific set of principles:
1.  “no  fault”:  a  worker  who  is  injured,  or  his/her 
survivor(s) in case of death, should qualify for bene-
fits without any necessity to prove “fault” on behalf 
of the employer;

2.  collective sharing of liability; and 
3.  neutral governance at some specified level of admin-
istration of the scheme, meaning that the right to 
benefit can be established outside the contractual re-
lationship between a worker and her or his employer.

World Social Protection Report 2014/153. Social protection for women and men of working age 

Box 3.7  International standards relevant for employment injury protection

The right to protection against employment injury is enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 
(UDHR), 1948, and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), 1966. 
The realization of this right requires the application of safe and healthy working conditions, the prevention, 
treatment and control of occupational diseases, and the provision of adequate benefits, in cash or in kind, 
that ensure access to adequate health care and income security to victims of employment injury and their 
dependent family members.1

Protection from employment injury has been the object of a number of Conventions and Recommenda-
tions adopted by the ILO from its early days. According to Convention No. 102 (Part VI), any condition that 
impacts negatively on health and which is due to a work accident or an occupational disease, and the 
incapacity to work and earn that results from it, whether temporary or permanent, total or partial, must be 
covered. The protection also includes, where a worker dies as a consequence of an employment injury or 
occupational disease, the loss of support suffered by her or his dependants. Accordingly, the provision must 
include medical and allied care, with a view to maintaining, restoring or improving the health of the injured 
person and her or his ability to work and attend to personal needs. A cash benefit must also be paid to the 
injured person or his/her dependants, as the case may be, at a guaranteed level and on a periodic basis, 
serving an income replacement or support function. Where the disability is slight, the benefit can, under 
certain conditions, be paid as a lump sum. 

The Employment Injury Benefits Convention, 1964 (No. 121), and its accompanying Recommendation, 
No. 121, set higher standards, mainly in terms of population coverage and level of benefits to be provided 
(see Annex III). Convention No. 121 also recognizes the importance of an integrated approach for improving 
working conditions, limiting the impact of employment injuries and facilitating the reintegration of persons 
with disabilities in the labour market and in society; for such purposes this Convention requires the State 
to take measures to prevent employment injuries, provide rehabilitation services and ensure that displaced 
workers find suitable re-employment.

The approach taken by Recommendation No. 202 is different, reflecting its focus on preventing or allevi-
ating poverty, vulnerability and social exclusion through income security guarantees, rather than on specific 
life risks; as such, it recognizes sickness and disability, in whatever cause or degree, as a potential source of 
financial insecurity which should be addressed, in so far as it prevents people of working age from earning 
sufficient income. In the same way, Recommendation No. 202 calls for guaranteed access to at least es-
sential health care for all in need, over the life cycle, irrespective of the origin of the disability or ill health 
for which such care is required. Basic income security and access to essential health care can be ensured 
through a variety of approaches, combining contributory and non-contributory schemes and different types 
of benefits, such as disability and employment injury benefits, as well as other social benefits, in cash or 
in kind. Particularly relevant to employment injury protection is the Recommendation’s further call for the 
combination of preventative, promotional and active measures with benefits and social services, and the 
coordination of social protection policies with policies that promote, among other things, secure work within 
a decent work framework. 

1 UDHR, Article 25(1), ICESCR, Art. 7 (b), 12 (b) and (c). See also ICESCR, General Comment No. 19, “The right to social 
security” (Art. 9), paras 2 and 16(e).

Within this framework, the aim of employment 
injury provisions in most countries is to meet the needs 
of workers who are incapacitated by injury at work 
or occupational disease, or of their dependent family 
members, by way of:
•  appropriate and relevant medical and allied care, 
• 

income replacement, by way of periodic cash bene-
fits, in case of disablement, which may be assessed as
–  temporary or permanent, 
–  partial or total, and

•  contingent benefits (periodic cash payments and 
funeral grants) payable to survivors (widow/er, chil-
dren or other dependent relatives, as the case may 
be) in case of death. 

Many national employment injury schemes have a 
set of wider aims, such as the re-employment of injured 
or sick workers, and the promotion and maintenance 
of decent levels of safety and health in the workplace. 
These objectives can only be achieved effectively if there 
is a high level of policy integration, not only between 
the various branches of social security schemes, but also 
between those and policies relating to labour markets, 
labour inspection and occupational safety and health 
(OSH).

The provision of adequate compensation in case 
of permanent partial disability represents one of the 
greatest challenges in the employment injury branch 
of social protection. An approach which focuses on the 
loss of bodily function tends to compensate essentially 

for the physiological loss and may result in either over- 
or  under-compensation from the economic point of 
view, even if the degree of disability is not assessed ex-
clusively on the basis of medical factors. An approach 
based on earning capacity attempts to relate the level 
of benefit to the economic loss arising from the injury; 
this imposes demanding administrative requirements 
for the management of claims, and needs to be com-
plemented by well-developed rehabilitation services 
in order to develop the residual capacities of injured 
workers. This in turn requires the full engagement of 
employers in the rehabilitation programme if it is to 
succeed. To achieve it, a rating system considering the 
past performance of employers in respect of occupa-
tional injury and disease can be used as an incentive to 
encourage employers’ participation in facilitating the 
return to work of injured workers, but this is possible 
only in medium and large firms. 

When it comes to implementation, another im-
portant criterion for measuring the effectiveness of 
employment injury schemes is the ability of the system 
to ensure that injured workers have access to the health-
care facilities, goods and services they need, and that 

cash benefits reach injured workers or their survivors 
without delay. The timely delivery of benefits requires 
the setting-up of effective reporting systems and accom-
panying measures to assist victims and their survivors 
in accessing employment injury insurance through 
simple and efficient claims procedures. Online report-
ing systems of occupational accidents and diseases are 
among the tools that can be used to facilitate access.

3.3.2   Types of employment injury  

protection schemes 

The majority of countries have adopted a social insur-
ance approach to employment injury, though some 
countries have retained some elements of the employer 
liability approach. This may facilitate the coverage of 
workers who are not compulsorily included in such 
schemes, but who may wish to participate on a volun-
tary basis. In a very few countries, most notably the 
Netherlands, employment injury coverage has been 
fully integrated with schemes providing coverage for 
non-work-related disabilities.

World Social Protection Report 2014/153. Social protection for women and men of working age 

Figure 3.12 illustrates the patterns of coverage 
worldwide. It can be seen that the emphasis on social 
insurance, as opposed to first-generation schemes oper-
ating under employer’s liability, is strongest in Europe, 
Central Asia and the Middle East, and lower in the 
Americas, Africa, and Asia and the Pacific. In the latter 
regions, employer liability provisions are still in place in 
a number of countries. 

3.3.3   Extent of legal coverage 

Gender differences in legal coverage for employ-
ment injury are particularly high in the Middle East 
and Africa, where the coverage rates for women are re-
spectively 18 and 13 percentage points lower than the 
overall coverage rates. In Latin American countries, 
the major gender difference is in access to social insur-
ance, which reflects to a large degree the over-represen-
tation of women in various types of occupation that 
are usually excluded from legal coverage, ranging from 
unpaid family work to self-employment.

Legal coverage for employment injury protects mostly 
those in formal employment, whereas workers in infor-
mal employment are rarely covered. Figure 3.13 sum-
marizes worldwide coverage and regional variations. At 
the global level, only 33.4 per cent of the total labour 
force, and only 31.7 per cent of the female labour force, 
is mandatorily covered by law through social insurance. 
When voluntary social insurance coverage and employer 
liability provisions are included, 39.6 per cent of the 
labour force is covered by law (36.7 per cent of the female 
labour force); effective coverage rates, however, may be 
significantly lower (see below). Not surprisingly, legal 
coverage rates reflect the general pattern of social protec-
tion coverage, with high levels in Europe (both West-
ern and Eastern) and North America, more moderate 
but still substantial levels in Latin America, and much 
lower levels in sub-Saharan Africa and most of Asia. 

3.3.4   Extent of effective coverage 

Legal  coverage  does  not  necessarily  translate  into 
effective coverage, for a variety of reasons; indeed, as 
figure 3.14 shows, the two diverge widely in many coun-
tries. In most countries for which data are available, the 
number of contributors (in most cases employers con-
tribute on behalf of their employees) lags behind the 
number of those covered by law. The figure highlights 
in particular a small group of countries which, on a the-
oretical basis, reach high levels of coverage, but on the 
basis of voluntary participation (a principle adopted in 
particular to promote scheme access for self-employed 
workers). This is most striking in the cases of Indonesia 
and the United Republic of Tanzania, where legal cov-
erage ratios, including voluntary coverage, stand at well 
above 70 per cent of the labour force, but where less than

10 per cent of the labour force is effectively covered in 
practice. It is in fact not uncommon for voluntary cov-
erage to be taken up by a fraction of those eligible under 
the law. Possible reasons for this low take-up include low 
contributory capacities in the population covered, a lack 
of understanding of the importance of coverage, a mis-
match between benefits offered and needs experienced, 
or overly complex procedures that deter participation. 

3.3.5   Adequacy of benefits  

to cover workers’ needs

Employment injury benefits for permanent disability 
are usually provided in the form of pensions. Schemes 
vary  widely  in  the  proportion  of  pre-disablement 
income provided (the replacement rate), as shown in 
figure 3.15. The same applies to temporary incapacity, 
as shown in figure 3.16, with further variation in the 
duration of the benefit.

The provision of suitable employment opportunities 
for workers disabled as the result of an employment 
injury is important.42 China provides an interesting ex-
ample. For certain degrees of disability, the employer 
must provide suitable employment or pay a pension 
equal to 60 per cent or more of the monthly net income 
of the injured worker.

3.3.6   Recent developments

From a global perspective, it is striking that while 
employment injury systems of some kind have been put 
in place in most countries, many low-income countries 
continue to rely on the principle of employer’s liability 
rather than social insurance. It is, moreover, question-
able whether countries with weak systems of enforce-
ment and supervision have the capacity to monitor and 
ensure compliance with the law. In addition, workers’ 
needs for effective protection in the event of employ-
ment injury are inadequately addressed in contexts 
where informality of employment prevails.

In this context, it is germane to note the implica-
tions of the accident which occurred at Rana Plaza in 
Dhaka, Bangladesh, in April 2013. Over 1,000 workers 
in industrial units located in the building lost their lives 
when it collapsed, and some 2,500 were injured (for 
more details, see box 3.8). It has been all too clear in 
the aftermath of this event that – among a host of in-
terlinked issues of concern in respect of occupational 
health and safety, social protection and labour market 
conditions – the toll of human suffering is being com-
pounded as a result of the lack of an effective scheme of 
employment injury protection. Recently, many coun-
tries have been developing and implementing national 
occupational safety and health programmes in line with 

42  This observation has similar aspects to the discussion of employment opportunities for older workers at the International Labour 
Conference in 2013 (ILO, 2013i).

the ILO’s Promotional Framework for Occupational 
Safety and Health Convention, 2006 (No. 187). These 
programmes can include employment injury insurance, 
strengthened reporting systems for occupational acci-
dents and diseases, and mechanisms for timely compen-
sation, and preventive measures. 

The transition from employer’s liability provisions 
to social insurance-based employment injury schemes, 
and the establishment of such schemes in countries 
which previously had no protection mechanism, consti-
tutes a significant improvement in the social security of 
workers. In Cambodia, the employment injury scheme 
introduced in 2009 as the first branch of the social in-
surance scheme covered 1,800 enterprises and more 
than 500,000 workers (representing close to 20 per cent 
of employees, most of them women) by the end of 2010 
(GIZ, ILO and P4H, 2012). 

Another trend in recent years has been a stronger 
focus on enabling a faster return to work for beneficiar-
ies. In a number of countries reforms were introduced 
to strengthen provisions for rehabilitation, among other 
measures (ISSA, 2012; OECD, 2010b; OECD, 2012a). 
While in some countries such measures were adopted 
with the objective of promoting rapid re-integration 
into working life, often requiring substantial additional 
upfront investments, in others such measures were 
taken with a clear cost-saving motive, often with am-
bivalent effects on the situation of beneficiaries. 

3.3.7   Challenges

Employment injury coverage interacts with coverage 
in other areas of social security, such as health care. 
Nevertheless, the health-care needs of victims of occu-
pational injury or disease may go beyond or differ from 
those of the majority of the people protected under 
general health-care schemes: for instance, the treat-
ment of certain occupational diseases may require spe-
cific types of specialist care. It is therefore important to 
ensure that possible gaps are addressed. In this light, it 
is a matter of concern that, even within Europe, there 
are a number of countries where fiscal consolidation 
measures have entailed severe cutbacks in health care 
(see Chapter 5). 

The financial needs addressed by employment injury 
schemes are similar to those of persons with disabil-
ities incurred outside work. Contributory disability 
schemes which cover loss of earning capacity due to 
non-work-related disablements usually require the com-
pletion of a qualifying period before the person covered 
becomes entitled to a benefit. This requirement serves 
as a safeguard against abuse, and allows the proper fi-
nancing of schemes to ensure the due payment of dis-
ability benefits on a long-term basis. By contrast, the 
qualifying conditions of employment injury benefit 
schemes should be designed in such a way that workers 
are protected against the consequences of employment 

52

Box 3.8  The Rana Plaza disaster and its implications  

for social security in cases of employment injury

On 24 April 2013, the Rana Plaza building in Dhaka, Bangladesh, which housed five garment factories, 
collapsed, killing at least 1,132 people and injuring more than 2,500. Only five months earlier, at least 
112 workers had lost their lives in another tragic accident, trapped inside the burning Tazreen Fashions fac-
tory on the outskirts of Dhaka. These disasters, among the worst industrial accidents on record, awoke the 
world to the poor labour conditions faced by workers in the ready-made garment sector in Bangladesh. For 
some of the lowest wages of the world, millions of people, most of them girls and women, are exposed every 
day to an unsafe work environment with a high incidence of work-related accidents and deaths, as well as 
occupational diseases. Most of the factories do not meet standards required by building and construction 
legislation. As a result, deaths from fire incidents and building collapses are frequent. In the absence of 
a well-functioning labour inspection system and of appropriate enforcement mechanisms, decent work 
and life in dignity are still far from reality for the vast majority of workers in the garment industry and their 
families. 

Given the hazardous working conditions and the high risk of exposure to employment injury in this sector, 
the provision of adequate benefits is of critical importance to compensate injured workers for the loss of 
earnings they are likely to suffer, and to ensure that they have access to the medical and associated care 
required by their condition. Access to some form of financial compensation or support for dependent family 
members who lose their breadwinner can also make the difference between life in dire poverty, where chil-
dren and older people are forced to work to survive, and life at or just above subsistence level. At present, 
the only form of financial protection available to workers and their dependants is set out in the labour code, 
which requires employers, when liable, to provide specified payments to injured workers or survivors.

A recent amendment to the labour code requires employers to insure themselves against liability, but no 
such obligation was in force at the time Tazreen caught fire, or when Rana Plaza collapsed. The amounts of 
compensation envisaged are also very low and take the form of lump sums, offering inadequate protection 
to beneficiaries against ill health and poverty in the medium and long term. The system is also plagued with 
major practical application issues (e.g. evasion, lack of proper enforcement, absence of effective recourse), 
with the result that legal entitlements very rarely materialize. 

Despite the magnitude of the losses suffered by victims of the Tazreen and Rana Plaza accidents and 
their survivors, no compensation was paid in application of the labour code provisions on employer liability. 
A small number of global buyers and local players made some payments to victims in the months following 
the disasters, albeit on a voluntary basis. To redress the situation more substantively and ensure that injured 
workers and dependants of the deceased were effectively compensated, both financially and in respect of 
medical and other relevant care, global and local stakeholders got together and agreed to an unprecedented 
coordinated framework. With the ILO acting as a neutral chair, an “Arrangement” was adopted, providing a 
single approach to compensation consistent with ILO standards, and more specifically with the Employment 
Injury Benefits Convention, 1964 (No. 121).1

The Tazreen fire and the Rana Plaza accident prompted local authorities and other stakeholders to take 
major steps to strengthen occupational safety and health, labour inspection services, and skills training 
and rehabilitation services in the long term, with the support, notably, of the ILO and of global buyers. No 
concrete action has been taken, however, to develop a sound and effective framework for the provision of 
employment injury benefits, in line with ILO standards and Convention No. 121, that would apply beyond 
these specific incidents. There is, nevertheless, hope for the future, as such a measure is included in the 
National Tripartite Action Plan on Fire Safety for the Ready-Made Garment Sector adopted in May 2013.

injury from their first day at work, and do not bear the 
health and financial risks of an unsafe or unhealthy 
work environment.

Employment injury benefits in case of permanent 
disability are long-term periodic payments, similar to 
other pensions, hence the need for an integrated ap-
proach within national systems. Integration prevents 
the duplication of benefits and enables the standardiza-
tion of adjustment mechanisms to ensure that the pur-
chasing power of benefits is maintained. 

The global trend towards coverage under social in-
surance is encouraging. Such a framework helps to pro-
mote the rights- and solidarity-based perspective which 
is essential to the long-term health of social protection 
systems. 

Complex issues may arise in the treatment of oc-
cupational diseases with long latency periods. While 
determining the time of occurrence of a work accident 
may not be problematic, determining the onset of an oc-
cupational disease may be more difficult. Many workers 

World Social Protection Report 2014/153. Social protection for women and men of working age 

are currently exposed to working conditions that may 
or may not lead to the development of an occupational 
disease over a long period of time. Such problems can be 
even more difficult to manage in the circumstances of 
developing countries where relevant regulations, relat-
ing for example to protective clothing and other safe-
guarding measures, may be poorly enforced. 

In those countries which have put in place employ-
ment injury insurance and workers’ compensation 
schemes to address these needs, it is important that the 
schemes be administered on a fair and consistent basis. 
Medical examinations, diagnostics and assessments must 
be rigorous, and based on a national list of occupational 
diseases. Such lists, however, may not always be seen as 
sympathetic to claimants, and tend to reflect a particular 
set of national or local conditions and perceptions.43 

Providing protection in cases of employment injury 
is an area of social security in which effective admin-
istration, and equitable treatment of claimants, plays a 
particularly crucial role. The role of administrators may 
be very wide, and closely interrelated with that of labour 
inspectors responsible for checking workplace safety as 
well as the whole range of measures to help prevent ac-
cidents at work, occupational injury and work-related 
diseases. An integrated framework comprising compre-
hensive occupational safety and health measures, strong 
inspection services and enforcement measures, as well 
as adequate cash and health-care benefits in the event 
of employment injury, accompanied by appropriate re-
habilitation services, remains the best way to ensure 
that workers and their family dependants are effectively 
protected against the risks of employment injury.

KEY MESSAGES
 n Effective measures to support persons with disabilities in finding and retaining quality employment 
are a key element of non-discriminatory and inclusive policies that help to realize their rights and 
aspirations as productive members of society. 

 n Complementing contributory schemes, non-contributory disability benefits play a key role in protecting 
those persons with disabilities who have not (yet) earned entitlements to contributory schemes, in 
particular those disabled from birth or before working age, and those who for any reason have not 
had the opportunity to contribute to social insurance for long enough to be eligible for benefits. 

 n Activation policies can play an important role in supporting persons with disabilities in finding suit-
able employment. They should be designed in such a way that they protect the rights of those who, 
for various reasons, are not able to find suitable employment, and for whom the introduction of such 
policies may result in a reduction of income security and potentially higher risk of poverty.

 n Policy reforms should therefore pay special attention to finding the right balance between supporting 
engagement in employment and providing an adequate level of income security for persons with disabilities.

3.4.1   Protecting and enabling persons  

with disabilities

According to global estimates, persons with disabilities 
constitute some 15 per cent of the world’s population; 
many of them live in developing countries. Around 
785 million persons with disabilities are of working 
age (15 years or over) (WHO and World Bank, 2011). 
Many of them are engaged in the labour market, and 

many of them face greater disadvantage than others 
in accessing decent work that matches their skills and 
qualifications. Compared to others, persons with dis-
abilities are less likely to be in full-time employment, 
more likely to find themselves in the informal economy 
and among the ranks of the working poor, and more 
likely to be unemployed and economically inactive 
(OHCHR, 2012; UN, 2013a; ILO, 2013d). Some per-
sons with disabilities may also find it difficult to obtain 

43  As a result, statistics on employment injury benefits may reflect a considerably lower degree of cross-national comparability than is the 
case for other areas covered in this report.
44  This section focuses on disability which arises outside employment and that is not the result of an employment injury. For an overview of 
the state of the world’s social security coverage of disability resulting from employment injury, see section 3.3 above.

Box 3.9  Disability benefits for income protection: Relevant international standards

The international human rights legal framework contains many explicit references to the right to social pro-
tection of persons with disabilities. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 1948, and the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, 1966, contain a general recognition of this right, while 
the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) goes into more detail.1 Together, they 
recognize the right of persons with disabilities to an adequate standard of living for themselves and their 
families, including adequate food, clothing and housing, to the continuous improvement of living condi-
tions, to social security and to the highest attainable standard of health. More specifically, according to 
the CRPD, States must safeguard and promote the realization of their right to social protection without 
discrimination on the basis of disability, providing equal access to appropriate and affordable services and 
devices and other assistance with disability-related needs; social protection and poverty reduction pro-
grammes; assistance with disability-related expenses; public housing programmes; and retirement benefits 
and programmes. The Convention also lays down the right of persons with disabilities to the enjoyment of 
the highest attainable standard of health without discrimination on the basis of disability. To this end, States 
must take all appropriate measures to ensure access for persons with disabilities to health services that are 
gender-sensitive, including health-related rehabilitation.

In a complementary way, successive standards adopted by the ILO set both basic minimum and higher 
standards of income protection which should be guaranteed to persons with disabilities in replacement 
of the income they were earning before disablement, or would have been earning from employment had 
they been able to work. More specifically, Convention No. 102 (Part IX – Invalidity Benefit) deals with the 
contingency of total disablement (not due to an employment injury) which results in a person’s inability to 
engage in any gainful activity and which is likely to be permanent. In these circumstances, protection is 
to be provided through periodic cash benefits, subject to certain conditions. The Invalidity, Old-Age and 
Survivors’ Benefits Convention, 1967 (No. 128), in its Part II, deals with the same subject matter but sets 
higher standards for disability benefits schemes. Its accompanying Recommendation, No. 131,2 broadens 
the definition of the contingencies that should be covered under national schemes by including partial 
disability, which should give rise to a reduced benefit, and by introducing the incapacity to engage in an 
activity involving substantial gain among the criteria for disability assessments. Convention No. 128 also 
requires the provision of rehabilitation services designed to enable persons with disabilities to either resume 
their employment or perform another activity suited to their aptitudes. 

Although medical care, including medical rehabilitation, is dealt with in separate provisions in Convention 
No. 102 (Part II) and the Medical Care and Sickness Benefits, Convention, 1969 (No. 130) – discussed 
at greater length in Chapter 5 – a comprehensive, coherent and integrated approach to disability benefits, 
such as the one set forth in the ILO’s normative framework, requires that equal attention be given to the in-
come support and medical needs of persons with disabilities. Hence, the standards set as regards the pro-
vision of medical care, including medical rehabilitation,3 are highly relevant; such care should be “afforded 
with a view to maintaining, restoring or improving [their] health … and [their] ability to work and to attend 
to [their] personal needs”.4 Convention No. 102 further requires the institution or government department 
administering medical care to cooperate with the general vocational rehabilitation services “with a view to 
the re-establishment of handicapped persons in suitable work” (Art. 35).

Recommendation No. 202 also puts forward an integrated and comprehensive approach to social protec-
tion and disability benefits, according to which persons with disabilities should enjoy the same guarantees 
of basic income security and access to essential health care as other members of society through national 
social protection floors. These guarantees can be provided through a variety of schemes (contributory and 
non-contributory) and benefits (in cash or kind), as is most effective and efficient in meeting the needs and 
circumstances of persons with disabilities to allow them to live in dignity. Some of the principles set out 
in the Recommendation are of particular relevance for persons with disabilities, including the principles of 
non-discrimination, gender equality and responsiveness to special needs, as well as respect for the rights 
and dignity of people covered by the social security guarantees.

or hold down employment due to their impairments or 
a non-supportive environment, or may be able to work 
only to a limited extent because of their impairments, 
and therefore have specific social protection needs.

Social protection systems play a key role in meet-
ing the specific needs of persons with disabilities with 
regard to income security, social health protection and 

social inclusion. Elements of social security systems 
that explicitly address disability-related needs include 
schemes or programmes that provide income support 
to persons with disabilities and their families (such as 
contributory or non-contributory disability pensions, 
other disability-related benefits and general social assist-
ance), social health protection and other mechanisms 

World Social Protection Report 2014/15to ensure universal health coverage.45 Schemes and pro-
grammes that support the (re-)integration of persons 
with disabilities into the labour market and facilitate 
their participation in employment also play a key role. 
In this respect, financial support to cover the disability-
related costs associated with having a job can help per-
sons with disabilities to avoid falling into poverty traps 
and facilitate their participation in productive employ-
ment (OHCHR, 2012; UN, 2013a). 

Almost all countries offer at least a basic level of pro-
tection for persons with disabilities, but do so within a 
variety of frameworks. In general, schemes tend to dis-
tinguish between permanent and temporary disability, 
and between different types and degrees of disability, 
in recognition of the fact that people with different 
kinds and duration of disability can have very differ-
ent needs.46 This is so not only in terms of benefits to 
provide for income and livelihoods, and of appropri-
ate health care, but also in terms of rehabilitation, re-
training and re-employment services. In respect of all of 
these factors, and also in the very definitions adopted, 
schemes designed in individual countries vary widely.

Employment injury benefits (see section 3.3 above) 
are highly relevant for persons with employment-re-
lated disabilities who benefit from coverage (mainly 
workers in the formal economy). For those who are not 
covered by such provisions, or where these do not exist, 
income security is largely dependent on general disabil-
ity benefits. In line with international standards (see 
box 3.9), such benefits should meet a number of crite-
ria in order to produce the desired outcomes: schemes 
should be designed to meet specific disability-related 
needs; they should not prevent access to other social se-
curity benefits, unless serving the same function; bene-
fits should be provided on a non-discriminatory basis; 
and benefits should not act as a disincentive to seeking 
employment.

3.4.2   Types of disability benefit schemes

Disability benefits may take various forms, depending 
on the type and objectives of the scheme(s) in place in a 
given country. In many countries, disability cash bene-
fits are accompanied by benefits in kind, such as free and 
adapted public transport, access to other public services 
free of charge, free or subsidized ergonomic equipment, 

3. Social protection for women and men of working age 

etc. While these benefits in kind have a monetary value 
and therefore contribute to guaranteeing income se-
curity, this section of the chapter focuses on cash bene-
fits, which account for the majority of disability benefits. 
Almost all countries have a scheme anchored in law 
that provides cash benefits to persons with disabilities 
(see figure 3.17). In a majority of countries (155) this is 
done at least partly through social insurance schemes. 
These mainly cover employees in the formal economy, 
and generally provide earnings-related disability bene-
fits that serve as income replacement in case of full or 
partial disability. In 27 countries (20 of which also have 
social insurance schemes), disability benefits are pro-
vided through a non-contributory universal scheme to 
all persons with assessed disabilities without regard to 
their income status. In 54 countries, social insurance is 
combined with means-tested benefits. In a further six 
countries, disability benefits are limited to means-tested 
benefits only. In 11 countries, the law provides for lump 
sums to be paid; four countries have no such scheme an-
chored in national legislation. 

As figure 3.17 shows, in a significant number of 
countries (81) the only form of income protection avail-
able to persons with disabilities consists of benefits paid 
through employment-related social insurance. Although 
in some countries disability-related needs may be cov-
ered through general social assistance benefits, the lack 
of specific non-contributory disability benefits raises 
concerns about the lack of protection of children with 
disabilities (UNICEF, 2013), and of adults with disabil-
ities who have never been able to work (whether because 
their disability existed at birth, or they became disabled 
before working age, or they had no access to education 
and, consequently, no access to employment) and so have 
never been able to contribute to social insurance. With-
out access either to employment with social security 
coverage, or to non-contributory benefits, persons with 
disabilities and their families are more at risk of poverty. 
Some important regional differences can be ob-
served regarding the scope of coverage (see figure 3.18). 
A first group of countries ensure the provision of dis-
ability cash benefits to eligible persons through social 
insurance mechanisms. These may be combined with 
non-contributory universal (or categorical) benefits, as 
in several countries in northern Europe (Finland, Den-
mark, Iceland), Eastern Europe and the CIS (Arme-
nia, Azerbaijan, Russian Federation, Hungary), together 

55

45  For discussion of universal health coverage, see Chapter 5 below.
46  It is also necessary to recognize that disability is a result of the interaction between a person with impairments and barriers in society, 
in line with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.

World Social Protection Report 2014/153. Social protection for women and men of working age 

with a few from other regions (notably the Plurinational 
State of Bolivia, Namibia and Mauritius); some other 
countries (Brunei, Hong Kong (China), New Zealand, 
Timor-Leste) rely simply on non-contributory provision. 
In 54 countries, mainly in Western Europe and 
Latin America, social insurance is complemented by 
poverty-targeted schemes, either specific to persons with 
disabilities or within more widely integrated social assis-
tance programmes (as for instance Bono de Desarrollo 
Humano in Ecuador). A third group of countries, in-
cluding Australia, South Africa and Nepal, have schemes 
which simply target poor persons with disabilities. 
A fourth group of 81 countries, mainly in Africa, the 
Middle East as well as Asia and the Pacific, provide social 
insurance benefits but exclude from that protection 
people outside formal employment. In these countries, 
it can be assumed that more limited coverage is likely to 
be achieved in the absence of a specific disability scheme 
to respond to the needs of persons with disabilities who 
are not in formal employment. In many of these cases, 
such people can gain access to benefits only through 
general social assistance programmes which cater par-
tially for their specific needs. In addition, the extent to 
which national schemes provide for persons with dis-
abilities may be curtailed by “capped” budgetary allo-
cations: this has been the case for the scheme in Nepal, 
which has notionally wide outreach, and seems likely to 
happen as a result of recent reforms taken in the light of 
moves towards fiscal consolidation even in the better-off 

European countries, including the United Kingdom. 
Similarly, Indonesia’s Jaminan Sosial Penyandang Cacat 
programme, while in principle providing cash transfers 
to people with severe disabilities in the poorest 40 per 
cent of the population, is subject to a limitation on funds 
resulting in very low coverage, estimated at 1.8 per cent 
of the target group (ILO, 2012e). On the other hand, the 
integrated Bono de Desarrollo Humano programme in 
Ecuador offers an encouraging illustration of extension 
of coverage to a significant proportion of persons with 
disabilities, who made up 1.7 per cent of beneficiaries 
in 2012, as compared with just 0.1 per cent before 2007 
(Cecchini and Madariaga, 2011).

3.4.3   Effective coverage for disability benefits

From the above review of the types of programmes in 
existence, it is possible to draw some inferences about 
levels of coverage, although the extent of available data 
does not allow for a fully detailed statistical assessment 
on the global scale. In order to calculate effective cover-
age ratios, it would be necessary to relate the number of 
beneficiaries of disability benefits to the number of per-
sons with disabilities affecting their earning capacity in 
each country. 

In countries of the European Union, on average 
27.9 per cent of persons with disabilities receive a dis-
ability benefit (see figure 3.19).47 This coverage ratio

Box 3.10  Income security for persons with disabilities: Illustrations from Europe

Income security for persons with disabilities is a critical issue, in view of functional limitations and difficul-
ties in accessing quality employment. At the EU level, the employment rate of persons with disabilities is 
much lower (45.5 per cent in 2010) than that of those without disabilities (71.7 per cent), and for those with 
severe disabilities it is lower still (26.2 per cent). 

Disability benefits and other social security benefits can partially correct for some labour market inequal-
ities, but only to a certain extent. In 2010, 19.1 per cent (19.9 per cent in 2009) of persons with disabilities 
compared with 14.7 per cent (14.3 per cent in 2009) of persons without disabilities lived in households 
classified as being at risk of poverty. The differential varies sharply between countries: it is relatively low 
in Hungary, Lithuania, Slovakia and the Netherlands but significantly greater in, for example, the United 
Kingdom, Slovenia and Portugal.

may appear low, but it should be noted that not all per-
sons with a disability either need or are entitled to a 
benefit; benefits are normally provided to persons with 
disabilities that are severe enough to significantly affect 
their functional capacities, and thereby their earning 
capacity. 

Nonetheless, persons with disabilities remain at 

higher risk of poverty than others (see box 3.10).

3.4.4   Recent developments and challenges

In recent years some countries have taken decisive steps 
to extend the coverage of disability benefits and en-
hance the adequacy of benefits (see box 3.11). Measures 
to extend the coverage of pension insurance to more 
groups of the population (e.g. self-employed, domestic 

workers) often include coverage for disability. The emer-
gence of cash transfer programmes covering poor and 
vulnerable categories of the population is also of par-
ticular relevance, as the presence in the household of 
a person with a disability at a degree that affects his or 
her earning capacity is often one of the eligibility crite-
ria of these programmes. Other existing non-contribu-
tory programmes have extended coverage by raising the 
means-testing threshold.

At the same time, disability benefits were not spared 
from fiscal consolidation measures introduced in the 
wake of the global crisis, some of which – adding to the 
more difficult labour market situation – significantly 
reduced income security for persons with disabilities 
(for examples, see box 3.11). 

Some of the recent policy reforms continue a longer-
standing  trend  to  bring  beneficiaries of disability

Box 3.11  Recent developments: Country examples

Some recent reforms in the area of disability benefits have aimed at extending coverage and better meeting 
the needs of persons with disabilities:
•  In Paraguay, coverage was extended in 2013 to allow self-employed, female heads of household, and 

domestic workers, to enrol voluntarily in the disability insurance scheme (OASDI).

•  South Africa extended the coverage for the disability grant in 2011 by applying a higher threshold for the 

means-test.

•  In Ghana, the presence of a person with a severe impairment in a poor household is one of the eligibility 

criteria under the LEAP programme introduced in 2008.

Other recent reforms in the area of social protection for persons with disabilities include some fiscal con-
solidation measures:
•  In Hungary, the disability pension was replaced in 2012 with a combination of a rehabilitation benefit 
(three years for retraining and re-entry in the labour force where feasible) and a significantly restricted 
disability benefit. The Government envisaged savings of around €800 million as a result.

•  In Lithuania, between 2010 and 2012 both the Special Compensation for Care Expenses and the Special

Box 3.12  How social protection can help persons 

with disabilities gain access to employment

Measures to facilitate the transition from receiving benefits to performing work have been introduced in 
several countries. Examples include a requirement that employers provide occupational health services and 
support for reintegration and employment; and so-called “bridging arrangements”, transitional arrangements 
which allow persons with disabilities who take up work to retain benefits until a certain wage threshold is 
reached, to resume receipt of benefits without delay should they lose their jobs, and to retain their right 
to benefits in kind – such as health care – for a specified period. This is the case in Australia, where, in 
order to encourage their greater participation in work, Disability Support Pension (DSP) recipients can now 
work for 30 hours per week before their benefit entitlements are affected. This change was combined with 
extra support for people with disability, including more employment services and financial incentives for 
employers to take on more persons with disabilities.

The Government in Ireland is committed to helping persons with disabilities to participate more fully in 
society, and to become more self-sufficient, by providing support to address financial and other barriers, 
as outlined in Department for Social Protection’s disability sectoral plan. The Reasonable Accommodation 
Fund for the Employment of Disabled People functions as an umbrella covering a series of private sector 
employment support programmes to help persons with disabilities to access and progress in employment. 
The Work Choice programme introduced in the United Kingdom in 2010 targets persons with disabilities 
facing complex barriers to employment to help them prepare to enter work, find a job, stay in work and 
progress into open, unsupported employment. 

In Saudi Arabia, the Tawafuq programme was dedicated to the extension of jobseeking support to persons 
with disabilities, through an encompassing framework including six areas: regulations and frameworks; ac-
cessibility; stakeholder awareness; employment programmes; skills and training; and disability data.

The Government of the United States provides funding and technical support for states to develop 
their strategies for disability employment policy, and grants funds to states that improve education and 
employment outcomes of persons with disabilities.

In the Russian Federation, the introduction in 2013 of amendments to the Federal Law on the Social 
Protection of Persons with Disabilities was intended to fill a gap in the legal regulation of employment of 
persons with disabilities. Also in 2013, public organizations for persons with disabilities planned to offer 
assistance in finding employment and to create 692 jobs for persons with disabilities. The total amount 
of subsidies from the federal budget to support public organizations for persons with disabilities was set 
at 124.36 million roubles. Since 2010, more than 7,800 unemployed persons with disabilities have found 
employment at workplaces where employers have equipped their work spaces to meet their physical needs.

benefits into employment through measures that sup-
port the return to work and strengthen the employ-
ability of persons with disabilities (ILO and OECD, 
2013; see also box 3.12). In OECD countries, most of 
the policy reforms prior to 2010 focused on contribu-
tory disability pensions, reducing levels of compensa-
tion and strengthening measures to bring beneficiaries 
(back) into employment (OECD, 2010b; ISSA, 2012). 
Some of these measures aimed to reverse the earlier 
trend of moving beneficiaries of unemployment bene-
fits to disability benefit schemes: in several countries 
(e.g. Australia, Denmark, Luxembourg, the Nether-
lands and, more recently, Hungary), people with signifi-
cant capacity for work are no longer eligible for partial 
disability benefits, but are supported in seeking part-
time work through wage subsidies and other in-work 
benefits, or receive unemployment or other benefits. 
While in some countries such reforms have had a sig-
nificant impact on eligibility conditions and benefit 
levels, they have had only limited success in increasing 
the proportion of persons with disabilities in employ-
ment. The reasons for this include an often unfavoura-
ble labour market situation and uneven implementation 
of effective rehabilitation, insertion and other measures 
intended to facilitate their (re-)integration into employ-
ment (OECD, 2010b). 

This assessment highlights an ambiguity often 
found in activation policies. Effective measures that 
support persons with disabilities in finding and retain-
ing quality employment are a key element of non-dis-
criminatory and inclusive policies that help to realize 
their rights and aspirations as productive members of 
society. There is, however, a risk that such policies may 
restrict the rights of those who, for various reasons, are 
not able to find suitable employment, and for whom 
such reforms may result in a reduction of income se-
curity and potentially higher risk of poverty. Policy re-
forms should therefore pay special attention to finding 
the right balance between supporting engagement in 
employment and providing an adequate level of income 
security for persons with disabilities, and promoting 
their individual autonomy and independence, and their 
full and effective participation in society.

3.5   Maternity protection 

KEY MESSAGES
 n Effective maternity protection ensures income 
security for pregnant women and mothers of 
newborn children and their families, and also 
effective access to quality maternal health 
care. It also promotes equality in employment 
and occupation.

 n Worldwide, less than 40 per cent of women 
in  employment  are  covered  by  law  under 
mandatory maternity cash benefit schemes; 
57 per cent if voluntary coverage (mainly for 
women in self-employment) is included.

 n Due to the ineffective enforcement and imple-
mentation of the law in some regions (Asia 
and the Pacific, Latin America and Africa in 
particular), effective coverage is even lower: 
only 28 per cent of women in employment 
worldwide are protected through contributory 
or non-contributory maternity cash benefits.
 n An increasing number of countries are using 
non-contributory maternity cash benefits as 
a  means  to  improve  income  security  and 
access to maternal and child health care for 
pregnant women and new mothers, particu-
larly for women living in poverty. However, 
significant gaps remain.

 n Ensuring effective access to quality maternal 
health  care  is  of  particular  importance, 
especially  in  countries  where  the  informal 
economy accounts for a large proportion of 
employment.

3.5.1   Maternity protection: Ensuring income 

security, maternal health care and 
women’s rights at work

Maternity protection is multidimensional. From a social 
security perspective, it includes protection against sus-
pension or loss of income during maternity leave, and 
access to maternal health care (see ILO, 2010c). Mater-
nity leave supported with cash benefits to fully or par-
tially replace women’s earnings during the final stages of 
pregnancy and after childbirth is of critical importance 
for the well-being of pregnant women, new mothers and 
their families. The absence of income security during 
the final stages of pregnancy and after childbirth forces 
many women, especially those in the informal economy, 
to return to work prematurely, thereby putting at risk 
their own and their children’s health.

Box 3.13  International standards relevant to maternity protection

Maternity protection has long been regarded by the international community as an essential prerequisite for 
the achievement of women’s rights and gender equality. Women’s right to maternity protection is enshrined 
in a number of major human rights instruments. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 1948, notably 
states that motherhood and childhood are entitled to special care and assistance, as well as to social se-
curity. The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, 1966, establishes the right of 
mothers to special protection during a reasonable period before and after childbirth, including paid leave or 
leave with adequate social security benefits. The Convention for the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimin-
ation Against Women, 1979, recommends that special measures be taken to ensure maternity protection, 
proclaimed as an essential right permeating all areas of the Convention. 

The ILO has led the establishment of international standards on maternity protection, adopting the first 
international standard on this subject in the very year of its foundation: the Maternity Protection Convention, 
1919 (No. 3). Since then, a number of more progressive instruments have been adopted in line with the 
steady increase in women’s participation in the labour market in most countries worldwide. The current ILO 
maternity protection standards provide detailed guidance for national policy-making and action to enable 
women to successfully combine their reproductive and productive roles. To this end, the standards aim to 
ensure that women benefit from adequate maternity leave, income and health protection measures, that 
they do not suffer discrimination on maternity-related grounds, that they enjoy the right to nursing breaks 
and that they are not required to perform work prejudicial to their health or that of their child. In order to 
protect the situation of women in the labour market, ILO maternity protection standards specifically require 
that cash benefits be provided through schemes based on solidarity and risk-pooling, such as compulsory 
social insurance or public funds, while strictly circumscribing the potential liability of employers for the 
direct cost of benefits. At the same time, the relevant standards aim at ensuring that women have access to 
adequate maternal health care and services during pregnancy and childbirth, and beyond. 

Convention No. 102 (Part VIII) sets minimum standards as to the population coverage of maternity protec-
tion schemes and for the provision of cash benefits during maternity leave, to address the suspension of 
earnings during this time (see Annex III, table AIII.7). The Convention also defines the medical care that 
must be provided free of charge at all stages of maternity, as required to maintain, restore or improve the 
health of the women protected and their ability to work, and to attend their personal needs. Maternal health 
care must be available not only to the women participating in a maternity protection scheme, but also to the 
wives of men covered by such schemes, at no cost to either.

The Maternity Protection Convention, 2000 (No. 183), and its accompanying Recommendation (No. 191), 
are the most up-to-date ILO standards on maternity protection. They set higher and more comprehensive 
standards on population coverage, health protection, maternity leave and leave in case of illness or compli-
cations, cash benefits, employment protection and non-discrimination, as well as breastfeeding. 

Recommendation No. 202 calls for such benefits to be provided as part of the basic social security 
guarantees that make up social protection floors. These include access to essential health care, including 
maternity care, comprising a set of necessary goods and services, and basic income security for persons 
of active age who are unable to earn sufficient income due, inter alia, to maternity. Maternity medical care 
should meet criteria of availability, accessibility, acceptability and quality (United Nations, 2000); it should 
be free for the most vulnerable; and conditions of access should not be such as to create hardship or 
increase the risk of poverty for people in need of health care. Cash benefits should be sufficient to allow 
women and their children a life in dignity, out of poverty. Maternity benefits should be granted at least to all 
residents, with the objective of achieving universal protection; a variety of schemes can be used to achieve 
such coverage, including universal schemes, social insurance, social assistance and other social transfers, 
providing benefits in cash or in kind.

61

Another fundamental component of maternity pro-
tection is maternal health care, namely effective access 
to adequate medical care and services during pregnancy 
and childbirth, and beyond, to ensure the health of 
both mothers and children. As with health care in gen-
eral (see Chapter 5), a lack of effective access to ma-
ternal health care coverage not only puts the health of 
women and children at risk, but also exposes families to 
significantly increased risk of poverty. 

According to ILO standards (see box 3.13), mater-
nity protection also includes the protection of women’s 

rights at work during maternity and beyond, through 
measures that safeguard employment, protect women 
against discrimination and dismissals, and allow them 
to return to their jobs after maternity leave under con-
ditions that take into account their specific circum-
stances (ILO, 2010c; ILO, 2013e; ILO, 2014e). It also 
includes occupational safety and health components 
that are essential to protect the health of pregnant 
and breastfeeding women and their babies, as well as 
 women’s  reproductive capacity. 

Box 3.14  Maternity protection: Collectively financed schemes  

vs employer’s liability provisions

Maternity cash benefits can be provided by different types of schemes: contributory (e.g. social insurance), 
non-contributory, usually tax-financed (e.g. social assistance and universal schemes) and employer’s li-
ability provisions. Collectively financed schemes, funded from insurance contributions, taxation or both, 
are based on the principles of solidarity and risk-pooling, and therefore ensure a fairer distribution of the 
costs and responsibility of reproduction. Employer’s liability provisions, on the other hand, oblige employers 
to bear the economic costs of maternity directly, which often results in a double burden (payment of both 
women’s wages during maternity leave and costs of their replacement), although employers may be able to 
obtain commercial insurance to cover their liabilities. While some individual workers may obtain appropriate 
compensation under such provisions, employers may be tempted to adopt practices that deny women the 
income security to which they should be entitled in order to avoid the related costs and the financial hard-
ship that they may entail for small businesses or in times of instability. Discrimination against women of 
childbearing age in hiring and in employment, and non-payment of due compensation by the employer, are 
more commonly evident in the absence of collective mechanisms to finance maternity protection. Pressure 
on women to resume work to the detriment of their health or that of their child may also be more prevalent 
where employers have to bear the costs of maternity leave. 

In order to protect the situation of women in the labour market, Convention No. 183 states a prefer-
ence for compulsory social insurance or publicly funded programmes as the vehicles for provision of cash 
benefits to women during maternity leave, confining individual employers’ liability for the direct costs of 
benefits to a limited range of cases.a Where women do not meet qualifying conditions for entitlement to 
maternity cash benefits, Convention No. 183 requires the provision of adequate benefits financed by social 
assistance funds, on a means-tested basis. 

Maternity cash benefits financed collectively have proved the more effective means of securing an 
income to women during maternity leave. In recent years, several countries have shifted from employer’s 
liability provisions to collectively financed maternity benefits, a trend that represents an advance for the 
promotion of equal treatment for men and women in the labour market.

a  According to Art. 6, para. 8, of Convention No. 183: ”An employer shall not be individually liable for the direct cost of 
any such monetary benefit to a woman employed by him or her without that employer’s specific agreement except where: 
(a) such is provided for in national law or practice in a member State prior to the date of adoption of this Convention by the 
International Labour Conference; or (b) it is subsequently agreed at the national level by the government and the repre-
sentative organizations of employers and workers.”

62

3.5.2   Types of maternity protection schemes

Maternity cash benefits are provided through schemes 
anchored in national social security legislation in 136 out 
of the 188 countries reviewed. A further two countries 
allow women to take maternity leave by law, but make no 
legal provision for replacement of their earned income. 
Of those 188, 50 countries – 38 of them in Africa 
or Asia – have provisions in their labour legislation set-
ting out a mandatory period of maternity leave and es-
tablishing the employer’s liability for the payment of the 
woman’s salary (or a percentage thereof) during that 
period (see box 3.14). 

Most maternity cash benefit schemes and employer’s 
liability provisions cover only women in formal employ-
ment. Consequently, in many low- and middle-income 
countries, where levels of formal employment are lower, 

maternity benefits are available only to a minority of 
women. Figure 3.21 shows the types of programmes 
existing in the 188 countries for which information is 
available. Social insurance schemes form the vast major-
ity of these programmes, prevailing in 134 countries, of 
which 11 also operate social assistance schemes.48

3.5.3   Extent of legal coverage

Worldwide, the vast majority of women in employ-
ment are still not protected against loss of income 
in the event of maternity. Only 35.3 per cent of em-
ployed women benefit from mandatory coverage by 
law and thus are legally entitled to periodic cash bene-
fits as income replacement during their maternity  
leave.49 In 55 countries (67 countries when voluntary 

48  For more detailed characteristics of the schemes in place in different countries, see Annex IV, table B.5.
49  When including voluntary coverage, legal coverage concerns nearly half of all women in employment (56.8 per cent), with the 20 additional 
percentage points concerning mainly the choice left to the self-employed to join (or not) the existing contributory scheme on a voluntary basis. 
In many countries, such voluntary provisions are taken up only sparsely; thus voluntary coverage may not reach the same level of protection as 
compared to mandatory coverage.

Note: In the United States there is no national programme. Under the Family and Medical Leave Act, 1993, maternity leave is unpaid as a general 
rule; however, subject to certain conditions accrued paid leave (such as vacation leave, personal leave, medical or sick leave, or paid medical 
leave) may be used to cover some or all of the leave to which a woman is entitled under the Act. A cash benefit may be provided at the state level. 
Provisions for maternity cash benefits exist in five states (New York, New Jersey, California, Hawaii and Rhode Island), under the class of temporary 
disability insurance for employees. Additionally, employers may offer paid maternity leave as a job benefit.

3.5.5   Adequacy of maternity benefits  

in ensuring income security  
during maternity leave

Irrespective of legal requirements, there may be obs-
tacles that prevent women from receiving the benefits 
to which they are entitled. In fact, just above one-quar-
ter (28.4 per cent) of employed women worldwide are 
effectively protected in maternity through contribu-
tory or non-contributory cash benefits. In much of 
Africa and South Asia, a small minority of women in 
employment (less than 10 per cent) are effectively pro-
tected through contributory or non-contributory forms 
of cash maternity benefits (figure 3.23). It is in many 
of these countries that employer’s liability provisions 
(see figure 3.21) prevail, informal employment plays a 

The adequacy of cash benefits provided during ma-
ternity leave to meet the needs of mothers and their 
babies can be assessed in terms of duration and amount. 
In order to allow women to fully recover after child-
birth, 96 countries out of 188 provide at least 14 weeks’ 
paid maternity leave, meeting the standards of Con-
vention No. 183; of these, 31 countries provide 18–26 
weeks, and ten more than 26 weeks (see figure 3.24). 
In 59 countries, the length of paid maternity leave is 
12–13 weeks, which still meets the minimum standard 
set out in Convention No. 102. In 31 countries, mater-
nity leave with cash benefits is less than 12 weeks.

The level of the maternity cash benefit, calculated as 
a proportion of women’s previous earnings for a min-
imum number of weeks of paid maternity leave, varies 
widely from country to country (figure 3.25). In 77 
out of the 188 countries, women are entitled to paid 
maternity leave of at least two-thirds of their regular 
salary for a minimum period of 14 weeks, meeting the 
benchmark of Convention No. 183. In 28 countries 
(nearly 15 per cent of the total reviewed), women are 
entitled to 100 per cent of their regular salary for at 
least 18 weeks, meeting the highest standard set out in 
Recommendation No. 191. An additional 17 countries 
provide benefit at a fixed level (for instance, the min-
imum wage). This leaves a large number of countries 
(61) in which women are entitled to benefit at a level 
lower than 67 per cent of previous earnings for a period 
of 12–13 weeks, which falls short of the benchmark of 
Convention No. 183 but is still in compliance with the 
minimum requirements of Convention No. 102. In 
31 countries, the cash benefit corresponds to less than 
45 per cent of the previous salary and/or the period of 
paid maternity leave is inferior to 12 weeks. 

3.5.6   Access to maternal health care

Access to free, affordable and appropriate antenatal and 
post-natal health care and services for pregnant women 
and mothers with newborns is an essential component 
of maternity protection. Access to maternal health care 
is closely associated with access to health care in gen-
eral, which is discussed in Chapter 5. 

The importance of guaranteed access to maternal 
health care in safeguarding maternal and infant health 
is highlighted in the Millennium Development Goals, 
particularly MDG5 on improving maternal health and 
MDG3 on reducing child mortality. While remarkable 
progress has been achieved in many countries in redu-
cing maternal and child mortality, some countries are 
still facing major challenges in this regard (UN, 2013b). 
It is widely recognized that one of the key enabling 
factors for maternal and child health is access to ante-
natal care, which is still uneven and far from univer-
sal in many regions (see figure 3.26). According to the 
latest available data, while 84.2 per cent of childbearing 
women receive antenatal care provided by skilled per-
sonnel during at least one visit to a health facility, only 
60.8 per cent of them were monitored during at least 
four visits. In sub-Saharan Africa, more than a quarter 
of childbearing women did not receive any ante natal 
care provided by skilled health personnel; the same is

least once during pregnancy. For health coverage, detailed information by 
country is available in Annex IV, table B.11. Global average weighted by total

World Social Protection Report 2014/153. Social protection for women and men of working age 

true for one in five women in North Africa, and one in 
six women in Asia and the Pacific.

Health coverage is a key factor in facilitating access 
to maternal health care (figure 3.27). Access to ante-
natal care is high where health protection is available to 
the majority of the population, but lower where a large 
proportion of the population is not protected. 

In many parts of the world, access to maternal 
health care is uneven and subject to significant dispari-
ties between urban and rural areas, and between poorer 
and more affluent groups of the population (see, e.g., 
Nawal, Sekher and Goli, 2013). In many developing 
countries, such disparities are closely associated with 
a lack of universal access to available and affordable 
health-care services of adequate quality, but the lack of 
financial protection that would allow women to benefit 
from existing services is also an important factor. 

Inequalities in access to maternal health services 
(both antenatal care and medical care during and after 
childbirth) jeopardize further progress with respect to 
maternal and child health in both middle- and low-
income countries. In most of these countries we ob-
serve significant levels of inequity in access to maternal 
health care across regions, and between residents of 
urban and rural areas, with urban populations tending 
to have better access to maternal health services. While 
inequalities are observed between urban and rural areas 
in countries in all parts of the world, the differential is 

much larger in Africa and in Asia and the Pacific than 
in other regions. These differentials are often associ-
ated with a lower density of health-care services in rural 
areas.

Another significant vector of inequality in access 
to maternity health protection is household wealth. In 
both low- and middle-income countries, only a small 
fraction of women in the lowest wealth quintile have 
access to maternal health protection, as compared to 
women in the highest wealth quintile (see figure 3.28). 
Such inequalities have detrimental effects on both ma-
ternal and child health, with often harmful long-term 
consequences for both individuals and societies.

Figure 3.29 illustrates the importance of providing 
quality maternal care services by showing the inverse 
correlation across countries between the percentage of 
births supervised by skilled birth attendants and the 
maternal mortality ratio.

Moreover,  the  available  evidence  suggests  that 
income security also contributes to the well-being of 
pregnant women, new mothers and their children. 
Countries that have a higher level of coverage for mater-
nity cash benefits also tend to achieve better results with 
respect to maternal mortality ratios. These results call 
for a comprehensive approach to maternity protection, 
combining maternal health care and income security, 
and also occupational safety and health measures, as 
stipulated in ILO maternity protection standards.

Notes: Inequities in access to maternal health services are measured by births attended by skilled health personnel as a percentage of total live 
births in the same period. Antenatal coverage is measured by the percentage of women aged 15–49 with a live birth in a given time period who 
received antenatal care four or more times. Due to data limitations, it is not possible to determine the type of provider for each visit. Detailed 
information and definitions are available in the Excel file (see link below). Global average weighted by total population (UN, World Population

3.5.7   Recent developments

Maternity protection is recognized globally as a cru-
cial component of social protection – effectively, as an 
investment to secure each country’s future human cap-
ital – as shown by the number and range of recent and 
continuing policy initiatives. 

Changes in maternity protection schemes in differ-

ent countries can be broadly classified as follows: 
•  extension of coverage, by enlarging the scope of ex-
isting schemes or introducing new contributory or 
non-contributory schemes;

•  adjustments to the level of (cash) maternity benefits/

allowances; or

•  adjustments to the duration of benefits.

Extending maternity protection coverage

Many countries (for example, Australia, Jordan and 
South Africa) have enacted reforms that extend the 
scope of maternity coverage to categories of women who 
were previously unprotected. This has been achieved 
through a variety of measures (see box 3.15).

A number of countries, including Argentina, Ban-
gladesh, the Plurinational State of Bolivia, India and 

Indonesia, have introduced or extended non-contrib-
utory maternity benefits to women workers in the 
informal economy or poor women in general. Non-
contributory benefits are usually not directly associ-
ated with an interruption of employment in the form 
of maternity leave, but pursue a broader objective of 
providing pregnant women and new mothers with a 
predictable cash benefit during the final stages of their 
pregnancy and after childbirth.

Some of these programmes combine cash transfers 
with conditions relating to the utilization of mater-
nal care services, with the aims of encouraging breast-
feeding and improving nutrition. In some countries, 
pregnant women and new mothers are among the 
target groups in broader conditional cash transfer pro-
grammes. In others, there are specific programmes for 
maternity benefits. Many of these programmes expli-
citly aim at reducing maternal and child mortality in 
accordance with the MDGs and with national pov-
erty reduction or social protection strategies. Some pro-
grammes explicitly aim at increasing the acceptance of 
family planning methods and reducing the incidence 
of child marriage. Benefits are usually provided only to 
women above a certain minimum age, and only for a 
certain number of pregnancies. Dedicated conditional 
cash transfer programmes have recently emerged in 
Bangladesh, Bolivia, India and Indonesia (see box 3.16). 

World Social Protection Report 2014/153. Social protection for women and men of working age 

Box 3.15  Maternity cash benefits: Some examples of recent expansion of coverage

A number of countries have extended coverage of maternity benefits to in recent years. 
•  Jordan established a new maternity benefit in 2011, covering workers in the private sector, financed 
through employer contributions of 0.75 per cent of assessable earnings. The scheme gives insured 
women the right to paid maternity leave at 100 per cent of previous earnings for a maximum of ten 
weeks. This benefit is expected to foster women’s participation in the labour market and remove disin-
centives to the hiring of women. 

•  In Australia, the National Paid Parental Leave scheme, introduced in 2011, established an entitlement to 
18 weeks of government-funded parental leave pay at the rate of the national minimum wage for eligible 
working parents (mothers and fathers). The scheme is subject to a (relatively generous) means test. To-
gether with the “baby bonus” that is also paid to non-working parents and is subject to a stricter means 
test, the parental leave scheme reaches close to universal coverage.

•  In South Africa, in 2003, domestic workers were brought under the Unemployment Insurance Fund, 

which is also responsible for the payment of maternity benefits.

Several countries introduced non-contributory benefits to extend the coverage of maternity benefits to those 
who are usually not covered by contributory schemes.
•  Argentina introduced a universal birth allowance in 2011, which covers women from the 12th week of 
pregnancy to the birth or end of pregnancy. This non-contributory programme complements the birth 
allowance provided by the social insurance scheme. The programme covered 22 per cent of births in 
Argentina in 2011, covering on average more than 66,000 women per month between May 2011 and 
June 2012.

In some countries, the receipt of non-contributory maternity benefits is linked to the fulfilment of certain 
conditions with regard to antenatal and post-natal health care. 
•  In Bangladesh, the Maternity Allowance Programme for Poor Lactating Mothers, introduced in 2008, tar-
gets women aged 20 and over, living on a monthly income of less than 1,500 taka; it also covers mothers 
with a disability and women who are the breadwinners of poor families. If eligible, they one-time support 
during either the first or second pregnancy to the amount of 350 taka per month for a period of two years. 
•  In Bolivia, the Bono Madre Niño and Bono Juana Azurduy de Padilla benefits are targeted on poor 
women and their families without medical insurance or access to the breastfeeding grant. During preg-
nancy and the first two years of the life of the child, beneficiaries receive cash benefits on condition that 
they follow a schedule of regular health checkups for both mother and child.

•  In India, the Indira Gandhi Matritva Sahyog Yojana (IGMSY) programme, introduced in 2010, provides 
cash benefits for pregnant women and lactating mothers in 52 pilot districts, covering approximately 
1.38 million women. A daily benefit for all women aged 19 and over (limited to first two pregnancies; and 
excluding those who are covered through benefits provided to public sector employees) of approximately 
US$1.68 for approximately 40 days aims at providing partial compensation for wage loss to encourage 
women to take adequate rest before and after childbirth. In addition, all eligible women receive a cash 
incentive of 4,000 rupees in three instalments from the end of the second trimester of pregnancy until 
the child reaches six months of age, conditional upon compliance with various conditions pertaining to 
registration, medical check-ups, vaccinations and breastfeeding practice. 

•  In Indonesia, the Keluarga Haparan (PKH) conditional cash transfer programme provided regular cash 
benefits to 1.5 million poor households in 33 provinces in 2012; its conditions include the requirement 
that pregnant women and lactating mothers regularly visit health facilities for check-ups. The programme 
complements the Jampersal programme, introduced in 2011, which provides universal free delivery care, 
including prenatal and post-natal consultations. 

•  In Ghana, the Ghana Social Trust pilot programme, implemented in two districts from 2009, provides 
regular cash transfers every two months to poor women until the child reaches the age of five, on condi-
tion that women register themselves and their families with the National Health Insurance Scheme (under 
which registration fees and annual contributions are partially or fully subsidized), follow a schedule of 
ante- and post-natal care, child health care and vaccinations, have their babies delivered with the assis-
tance of skilled health personnel and register the birth. In addition, women are encouraged to participate 
in health education sessions.

Box 3.16  Measures to facilitate parents’ return to work 

Supply-side measures to facilitate mothers’ return to work after childbirth through help with training and job-
search were implemented in Japan and the Russian Federation. In the latter, access to training programmes 
designed for jobseekers was extended to women on parental leave to care for a child under the age of three. 
In 2011, 26,200 women benefited from these programmes, out of which 15,700 found jobs. Additional 
measures included the introduction of flexible forms of work, self-employment programmes for women, and 
pre-school education for children aged 3–7. A Japanese programme supporting mothers of young children 
in their job search, for instance through nursing services, and information services was re-invigorated. In 
2011, 69,000 women used the programme and successfully found a job.

In Italy, vouchers giving access to childcare services were introduced to promote female employment. 
Through this and other measures, takeup of formal child care was increased significantly, from 1 million 
children in 2011 to a projected 1.4 million in 2016/17, largely through direct financial assistance to families 
for childcare, and also through childcare support for parents receiving income transfers who are training or 
studying in order to find jobs. A one-day paid parental leave was introduced in 2012.

In Australia, Child Care Flexibility Trials and a Child Care Flexibility Fund were created to improve access 
to childcare, particularly outside standard hours, and hence allow women more flexible participation in the 
labour market. In addition to these supply-side measures, Australia also introduced parental leave pay at the 
national minimum wage and two weeks’ payment for working fathers or partners. Since its implementation 
in January 2011, 240,000 individuals have benefited from this measure. Flexible childcare arrangements 
targeting families who require care outside standard working hours were also offered.

Box 3.17  Recent contraction measures 

Some recent reforms have resulted in a significant reduction of benefit levels for certain categories of 
beneficiaries. 
•  In the Czech Republic, the level of maternity benefit was temporarily reduced from 69 per cent to 60 per 

cent of the daily basis of assessment per calendar day in 2010, but has since been raised again. 

•  Germany reduced maternity benefits from 67 per cent to 65 per cent of previous salary for those with net 

earnings of more than €1,200 per month. 

•  Ireland reduced the maximum maternity benefit for new claimants from €262 to €230 per month as 
of January 2014 with the objective of saving €30 million. From 2013/14, maternity benefit is treated as 
taxable income. Consequently, around 48,000 women per year will be paying an average of €833 extra 
each in taxation, yielding savings of €40 million.

•  In Latvia, the replacement rate of maternity benefit was reduced from 100 per cent to 80 per cent of 
insurable earnings in 2011. The Government also decided to extend the cap on the amount of sickness, 
maternity, paternity, parental and unemployed benefits paid until 31 December 2014. These measures 
are expected to save 25.83 million lat (LVL) in 2013 and LVL26.42 million in 2014. 

•  In Lithuania, the Law on Sickness and Maternity was amended in 2010 to temporarily reduce replace-

ment rates of maternity/ paternity benefit from 100 per cent to 90 per cent of previous earnings. 

•  In Romania, a 15 per cent cut in maternity benefits was implemented as an emergency measure in 
2010. The law enacting this reduction also changed the maternity benefits policy: benefits now amount to 
75 per cent of previous earnings subject to a ceiling of 3,400 lei (RON) per month for a one-year period 
of leave, and of RON1,200 for a two-year leave. A bonus of RON500 per month is available to workers 
earning taxable income before the end of their one-year leave.

•  In the United Kingdom, the conditional Health in Pregnancy grant of £190 for each expectant mother was 
abolished in 2011 in order to reduce the government deficit. It has been replaced with a £500 grant for 
first-time parents claiming other types of social benefits such as Income Support or Working Tax Credit.

Enhancing the duration and scope  
of maternity benefits

Contraction measures

Several countries have extended the duration of paid 
maternity leave in law, following the adoption of Con-
vention No. 183 in 2000. Although they have not yet 
ratified it, China, Colombia and Malta now meet the 
minimum benefit level requirements set by this Con-
vention, and several countries, including Chile and the 
Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, have gone further. 
A number of other countries (including Finland and 
Ireland) have increased the minimum rate of benefit 
levels and indexation mechanisms. 

In addition, a number of countries have strength-
ened complementary provisions relating to assistance 
for mothers wishing to return to work (including Japan 
and the Russian Federation) and those relating to 
childcare facilities (including Australia and Italy; see 
box 3.16).

In the context of the financial and economic crisis, sev-
eral countries have taken measures that have reduced 
the level of maternity protection (see box 3.17). In 
countries including the Czech Republic, Germany, Ire-
land and the United Kingdom, the level of maternity 
benefits has been reduced. In addition, maternity bene-
fits are now treated as taxable income in Ireland. 

Some of these fiscal consolidation measures have 
significantly reduced the level of maternity protection 
available to certain groups of pregnant women and new 
mothers. Although in some countries measures have 
been taken to protect the levels of protection available 
to those on lower incomes, other groups may still have 
suffered marked reductions in the benefits they receive, 
jeopardizing their income security during this critical 
period of their lives. In addition, access to maternal 
health care may also have suffered from cuts within 
the health-care system (see Chapter 5). At a time when 
many European governments are considering or im-
plementing measures to encourage higher birth rates, 
ill-designed fiscal consolidation measures may have un-
intended negative effects. It is thus necessary to care-
fully consider the short- and long-term impacts of 
policy reforms in this area.

KEY MESSAGES 
 n The right to income security in old age, as grounded in human rights 
instruments and international labour standards, includes the right to an 
adequate social security pension. In many countries with high shares of 
informal employment, pensions are accessible only to a minority, and 
many older persons can rely only on family support. 

 n Nearly half (48 per cent) of all people over pensionable age do not 
receive a pension. For many of those who do receive a pension, pension 
levels are not adequate. As a result, the majority of the world’s older 
women and men have no income security, have no right to retire and 
have to continue working as long as they can – often badly paid and in 
precarious conditions. 

 n Under  existing  laws  and  regulations,  only  42  per  cent  of  people  of 
working age today can expect to receive contributory or non-contributory 
social security pensions from contributory schemes in the future, and 
effective coverage is likely to be even lower. This gap will have to be 
filled to a large extent by an expansion of non-contributory provisions.

 n Many countries have recently made efforts to expand the coverage of 
contributory pension schemes and to establish non-contributory pensions 
to guarantee at least basic income security guarantee in old age to all. 
 n At the same time, there is a continuous global pressure which – under 
the guise of ensuring the sustainability of pensions in ageing societies 
and consolidating public finances – aims at reducing state responsibility 
for guaranteeing income security in old age and shifting large parts of 
the economic risks associated with pension provision on to individuals, 
thereby undermining the adequacy of pension systems and reducing 
their ability to prevent poverty in old age. In some countries, recent 
reversals of earlier reforms, including earlier privatizations of pension 
systems, have addressed these challenges, including the erosion of pen-
sion adequacy.

 n The income security of older women and men depends also on their 

access to social services, including health care and long-term care.

74

4.1   The crucial role of pensions  
in ensuring income security  
and well-being of older persons

It is essential that persons are provided with reliable 
sources of income security throughout their old age. As 
people grow older, they can rely less and less on income 
from employment for a number of reasons: while highly 
educated professionals may often continue well-remu-
nerated occupations until late in their life, the major-
ity of the population is usually excluded from access to 
well-paid jobs at older ages. Private savings and assets 
(including housing ownership) make a difference, but 
for most people are usually not sufficient to guarantee 
an adequate level of income security until the end of 
their lives. Private, intra-family transfers may be im-
portant as an additional source of income security but 
are very often far from sufficient and not always reliable, 
in particular for families already struggling to live on a 
low income.

For all these reasons, in many countries public pen-
sion systems became a foundation on which at least 
basic income security has been built. Income security 
in old age depends also on the availability of and access 
to publicly provided social services – provided free or at 
low charge – including health care and long-term care. 
If secure and affordable access to such services is not 
provided, older persons and their families are pushed 
into extreme poverty.

4.2   Types of pension schemes

Public social security pensions have become important 
institutional solutions to guarantee income security in 
old age. Public pensions are usually supplemented in 
that task by publicly regulated private provision. In 
OECD countries, 59 per cent of household incomes of 
men and women aged 65 and over comes from public 
pension transfers (another 24 per cent comes from 
income from employment and self-employment, and 
17 per cent from capital income – mainly private pen-
sions) (OECD, 2013a; see figure 4.1).1 This overall 
picture, however, hides large variations between and 
within countries. While in the majority of European 
countries public pensions are the source of more than 

60 per cent of older person’s incomes, in other re-
gions – often due to limited public pension coverage – 
this share is much smaller. In many countries of the 
world, the pattern is similar to that evident in OECD 
countries such as the Republic of Korea, Mexico and 
Chile, where the majority of older persons’ income 
comes from work.

In many OECD countries public pensions are the 
main source of income for older persons, particularly 
among the poorer part of the population: on average, 
public pensions account for more than 80 per cent 
of income for those in the lowest four deciles of the 
income distribution, while income from employment 
ranges between 5 and 9 per cent of the total income 
of these groups. On the other hand, in the top four 
deciles income from employment brings in between 20 
and 40 per cent of all income of older persons. High 
earners in high-quality jobs are also usually in good 
health, fit and eager to continue their occupations, at 
least part time; those in low-quality and badly paid jobs 
often have to stop employment relatively early due to ill 
health or because they have been made redundant. Also, 
when older, they are excluded from earning opportun-
ities which would supplement their low pensions.

Income from private pensions and other capital 
income constitutes less than 10 per cent of the total 
income of those in the lowest three deciles, after which 
this share grows with income to reach one-quarter in 
the top decile.

In some parts of the world outside the OECD, 
coverage by public pensions is low and pensions play 
a less prominent role as a source of income for less af-
fluent groups of the population. The majority of older 
women and men in these countries work as long as they 
physically can – but this does not necessarily prevent 
them from being in poverty. In OECD countries, as 
figure 4.2 indicates, the greater the coverage by public 
pensions and – as a result – the greater the share of 
public pensions in older persons’ incomes, the less pov-
erty there is. In other countries, where the informal 
economy is large, the same pattern applies only where 
coverage by non-contributory pensions is at a high level 
(e.g. South Africa).

Housing wealth also has a significant impact on 
standards of living and the extent of poverty among 
older persons. Home ownership is usually much lower 

1  Income from work includes both earnings and income from self-employment. Capital income includes private pensions as well as income 
from returns on non-pension savings. Figure 4.1 shows the composition of incomes among individuals over 65 from work, capital and 
public transfers, focusing on those in the first decile of income (lowest), the fifth decile (middle) and the tenth decile (highest). For more 
information, see OECD, 2013a, p. 72.

among lower-income households, and thus has only 
limited impact on the risk of poverty: in EU countries, 
for example, inclusion of estimates of so-called “im-
puted rent” (rent that the owners do not pay because 
they own their house) decrease the relative risk-of- 
poverty  incidence  by  only  3.5  percentage  points 
(OECD, 2013a, p. 104).

Whether cash income from pensions or other trans-
fers is sufficient to ensure income security depends on 
many other factors, such as the need to pay for health-
care services, housing, long-term care, and other goods 
and services if needed. How provision of these services 
is secured and how are they financed also determine 
levels of income security in old age. An OECD study 

(OECD, 2013a, Chapter 2), shows, for example, that 
publicly provided in-kind services (including health 
care and long-term care) add on average 40 per cent 
to the value of monetary incomes of people aged 65 
and over in OECD countries (compared to only 24 per 
cent for people of working age). In countries with wider 
access to quality public services, poverty in old age is 
also significantly lower. In most non-OECD countries, 
however, availability of and access to public services is 
often very limited and thus they do not play a similar 
role in the enhancing incomes of older persons and re-
ducing poverty among them.

There exist a wide range of schemes providing differ-
ent types of cash and in-kind benefits to older persons. In 

types of benefits provided by mandatory or quasi-man-
datory (voluntary but with very wide coverage) schemes 
established by legislation, regulations or collective 
agreements. The indicators for the scope and extent of 
coverage take into account only coverage by any kind 
of cash periodic benefits (pensions); schemes providing 
lump-sum payments alone do not qualify. 

The  broad  majority  of  countries  (166  out  of 
178 countries for which information is available) pro-
vide pensions through at least one scheme, and often 
through a combination of different types of contribu-
tory and non-contributory schemes (see figure 4.3). The 
remaining 12 countries provide only lump-sum benefits 
through provident funds or similar programmes.

However, in 77 countries (over 43 per cent of the 
total number of countries but nearly 70 per cent of 
low-income countries) there exist schemes covering, 
on a contributory basis, only employees in the formal 
economy and exceptionally also certain groups of self-
employed. In an equal number of countries, such em-
ployment-related contributory pension schemes are 
complemented by non-contributory schemes, either 
aimed at all older persons (27 countries) or at only 
those below a certain income threshold (50 coun-
tries). In only a small number are pensions provided 
on a non-contributory basis to all older people (nine 
countries) or to all those who pass a means test (three 
countries).

76

addition to the public social services mentioned above, 
in-kind benefits may include housing and energy sub-
sidies, home help and care services, and residential care. 
Cash benefits can be periodic payments awarded at 
reaching a specified age (and also often meeting other 
prescribed entitlement conditions) which are then paid 
throughout the remainder of the beneficiary’s life. Such 
periodic payments are called pensions (or life annuities), 
and can be classified into two main types: 
•  Old-age pensions from contributory schemes of 
mandatory public social insurance and/or voluntary 
occupational or other private pension schemes. 

•  Old-age pensions from public non-contributory 
schemes, which can be (a) universal, covering all 
people above the eligible age who meet either a citi-
zenship or minimum duration of residency condi-
tion; (b) pension tested;2 or (c) means tested.3 Most 
non-contributory schemes are national, but some are 
limited to certain geographical areas.4

Only pensions (that is, periodic payments: mainly life 
annuities but also means-tested benefits) are recognized 
by ILO standards such as Convention No. 102, or the 
Invalidity, Old-Age and Survivors’ Benefits Convention, 
1967 (No. 128), as benefits potentially able to protect 
individuals properly against the risk of outliving their 
own savings or assets. However, sometimes contributory 
pension schemes pay part of the benefit as a lump sum. 
In such situations it is important to make sure that the 
annuity part of the overall benefit is adequate. In many 
countries only a lump sum is available, or (as for exam-
ple in Chile) people can opt at retirement for so-called 
“scheduled withdrawal” (under which their pensions are 
paid not as a life annuity but only for a limited number 
of years): such arrangements do not guarantee the level 
of security required by international standards.

The benefit expenditure data presented in this chap-
ter attempt to cover, as far as evidence is available, all 

Globally, more than half of total public non-health 
social security expenditure, amounting to 3.3 per cent 
of global GDP, is allocated to income security for older 
persons (see figures 4.4 and 4.5).5 Variations among 
regions are obviously influenced by differences in the 
demographic structure of the population, but also by 
variations in the policy mix between public and pri-
vate provision for pensions and social services. Public 
non-health social protection expenditure for older per-
sons takes the highest proportion of GDP in Western 
Europe, at 11.1 per cent, followed by 8.3 per cent of 

2  Non-contributory pensions of this type are provided to those older persons who do not receive a contributory pension at all, or whose 
contributory pension is below a certain minimum threshold; other types of incomes are not taken into account (as would be the case for 
means-tested pensions). Examples of this type of scheme include the Old Age Social Pension in Armenia and similar pensions in most 
CIS countries, as well as the “100 a los 70” scheme in Panama, the Old Age Allowance in Nepal, and the Allowance for Older People in 
Thailand.
3  Means-tested pensions are provided only to those older persons whose pension and other income remains below a certain threshold. 
Means-tested pensions are not, strictly speaking, life annuities if designed and implemented in a way which includes all in need and at 
a level “sufficient to maintain the family of the beneficiary in health and decency” according to the requirements of ILO standards. The 
Older Persons’ Grant in South Africa, for example, although means tested, effectively covers the majority of older people in the country and 
effectively prevents the recipients and their families from falling into poverty.
4  For example, the Programa Colombia Mayor.
5  While the data include not only pensions but, so far as possible, other cash and in-kind benefits for older persons, they do not usually 
include expenditure on long-term care, the cost of which in many countries is already significant and is likely to increase further in the 
future due to demographic change.

gests a disproportionately low (in relation to the size of 
the older population) allocation of resources to income 
security in old age, as one element of a wider need to 
invest more in social protection (UN, 2013e).

World Social Protection Report 2014/154. Social protection for older women and men: Pensions and other non-health benefits

Box 4.1  International standards on old-age pensions 

The rights of older persons to social security and to an adequate standard of living to support their health 
and well-being, including medical care and necessary social services, are laid down in the major inter-
national human rights instruments, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), 1948, and (in more 
general terms) the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), 1966.1 The 
content of these rights is further specified in the normative body of standards developed by the ILO, which 
provide concrete guidance to countries for giving effect to the right of older persons to social security, from 
basic levels to full realization.2

The Social Security (Minimum Standards) Convention, 1952 (No. 102), the Old-Age, Invalidity and Sur-
vivors’ Benefits Convention, 1967 (No. 128), and its accompanying Recommendation No. 131, and the 
Social Protection Floors Recommendation, 2012 (No. 202), provide an international reference framework 
setting out the range and levels of social security benefits that are necessary and adequate for ensuring 
income maintenance and income security, as well as access to health care, in old age. The extension of 
coverage to all older persons is an underlying objective of these standards, with the aim of achieving univer-
sality of protection, as explicitly stated in Recommendation No. 202.

Conventions Nos 102 and 128 and Recommendation No. 131 make provision for the payment of pen-
sions in old age, at guaranteed levels, upon completion of a qualifying period, and their regular adjustment 
to maintain pensioners’ purchasing power. More particularly, Conventions Nos 102 and 128 envisage the 
provision of income security to people who have reached pensionable age through earnings-related contrib-
utory pensions (guaranteeing minimum benefit levels, or replacement rates, corresponding to a prescribed 
proportion of an individual’s past earnings – in particular to those with lower earnings) and/or by flat-rate 
non-contributory pensions which can be either universal or means-tested. The guaranteed minimum levels 
for the latter should be a prescribed proportion of the average earnings of a typical unskilled worker, but the 
“total of the benefit and other available means … shall be sufficient to maintain the family of the beneficiary 
in health and decency” (Convention No. 102, Art. 67(a)). 

Recommendation No. 202 completes this framework by calling for the guarantee of basic income security 
to all persons in old age, prioritizing those in need and those not covered by existing arrangements. Such a 
guarantee would act as a safeguard against poverty, vulnerability and social exclusion in old age, for people 
not covered by contributory pension schemes. It is also of high relevance to pensioners whose benefits 
are affected by the financial losses suffered by pension funds, whose pensions are not regularly adjusted 
to changes in the costs of living, or whose pensions are simply inadequate to secure effective access to 
necessary goods and services and allow life in dignity. ILO social security standards thus provide a compre-
hensive set of references and a framework for the establishment, development and maintenance of old-age 
pension systems at national level.

An important social policy challenge facing ageing societies is to secure an adequate level of income for 
all people in old age without overstretching the capacities of younger generations. In view of the financing 
and sustainability challenge faced by social security systems in the context of demographic change, the 
State has a vital role to play in forecasting the long-term balance between resources and expenditure in 
order to guarantee that institutions will meet their obligations towards older persons. The principle in ILO 
social security standards, strongly reaffirmed recently by Recommendation No. 202, of the overall and 
primary responsibility of the State in this respect will undoubtedly play an important role in how future 
governments are held accountable for the sustainability of national social security systems in view of, among 
other factors, demographic change. 

1  UDHR, Arts 22 and 25(1), and ICESCR, Art. 9. 

2  See UN, 2008.

79

These regional variations in expenditure levels re-
flect the prevailing situation in actuality, in which most 
older persons in higher-income countries enjoy their 
rights to retirement and to income security in old age 
(see box 4.1), while in lower-income countries these 
rights are given only to a minority. 

As clearly stated in Recommendation No. 202, 
national social protection floors should guarantee, in 
addition to income security, at a minimum “access to 
a nationally defined set of goods and services, consti-
tuting essential health care” (Part II, Para. 5(a)). This 
is particularly important for older persons, not just 

to ensure good health, but also because it has a role 
in protecting against health-related poverty, given 
that older persons generally have greater and specific 
health-care needs and may have to rely on long-term 
care. This concerns particularly older women, who in 
many countries tend to live alone in the later stages of 
their lives (Scheil-Adlung and Bonan, 2012). Thus, old-
age pensions must be closely coordinated with other 
social protection provisions, especially in the areas of 
social health protection, long-term care (see box 4.2) 
and disability, in order to address the particular needs 
of older persons. 

80

Box 4.2  The crisis of the care economy: Risks associated with inattention  

to long-term care needs in times of fiscal consolidation 1

The need for long-term care is constantly growing as numbers of older persons everywhere increase. 
Across the world, at present such care is predominantly provided by relatives, mainly women. However, 
this work is often not sufficiently valued and not remunerated adequately, if at all. Over recent years the 
situation has become even worse, not only because of demographic ageing, leading to a growing number of 
older persons with chronic illnesses, but also because younger women are now more likely to participate in 
the labour market and thus less likely to be available for family care. 

In the face of these changes in the health profile and lifestyle patterns of families, social protection provi-
sions for long-term care are in many cases inadequate. However, the problem goes far beyond families 
and national policies; indeed, it amounts to a global crisis of the care economy. The lack of nurses and 
other care professionals to meet the growing need has resulted in an ever-increasing pull of labour from 
developing countries into developed countries. It is based on international “labour supply chains” involving 
mostly female migrant workers from poor families who provide care services to meet the physical and 
emotional needs of older persons. Often the wages, conditions of work and social security coverage of 
caregivers in recipient countries are insufficient, with a negative impact on the quality of care, resulting in 
discontent on the part of both caregivers and beneficiaries. 

Debates are taking place in Thailand, Viet Nam and other countries on how to improve institutional and 
home care, often in the hope that volunteer caregivers and self-help groups can play a bigger role and that 
demands on public expenditure can be minimized by shifting the financial impact to the private sector (see 
e.g. HelpAge International, 2014). Similar approaches are being pursued in India and Singapore, and in 
China, where legislation has been implemented that imposes on adult children the responsibility to provide 
the care their parents need, under threat of jail or fines if they do not. In other regions of the world, such 
as Africa and Latin America, policies are also built on the assumption that private networks – communities 
or families – can shoulder the burden of care for older persons, sometimes overlooking limitations in the 
capacities of family carers (most of whom are women) and the impacts of such unpaid work on the quality 
of care, the income of care families, and the health and future employability of carers. The global inatten-
tion to the care needs of older persons reflects broader attitudes towards older persons and can also be 
observed in other social protection systems that should both prevent and meet long-term care needs. In 
health care, for example, the number of geriatricians is often insufficient to meet the need. 

Only few countries have implemented specific schemes providing benefits for long-term care. Most 
of these are using tax-based financing, as is the case in Denmark, Norway and Sweden. Only a small 
number of countries, including Germany, Japan, the Netherlands and Taiwan (China), are using social 
insurance schemes to cover related costs. Given the complexity of both needs and the schemes in place, 
significant “long-term care literacy” is required from older persons when applying for the benefits they 
need. These benefits might be in cash – including those for financial support of family carers – or in kind, 
such as institutional care and home care. Eligibility criteria vary widely and are frequently means-, age- 
and needs-tested.

Generally, although public expenditure on long-term care remains very low compared to expenditure 
on health and old-age pensions, European Union projections – while admitting uncertainty regarding the 
magnitudes of fiscal consequences and considering a number of alternative scenarios – foresee at least a 
doubling of current expenditure levels by 2060 (figure 4.6).

Given the limited availability of public resources, all the existing schemes and systems are character-
ized by a strong reliance on co-payments from both public and private sources. As a result, out-of-pocket 
 payments (OOP) for long-term care have a significant impact on the disposable income of older persons: 
recent ILO research (Scheil-Adlung and Bonan, 2012) has found that even in European countries OOP on 
long-term care amounts on average to 9.6 per cent of older persons’ household income and can be as 
much as 25 per cent. The poor, women and the very old are particularly affected. In fact, the very old, aged 
80 and over, face OOP up to seven times as high as those of beneficiaries aged between 65 and 79 years. 
In this context, given the variable availability of carers and affordability of services, it should be noted that 
statistics on OOP include only those who have effective access to such services, and excludes those who 
are too poor to purchase such services or cannot obtain them due to the lack of care workers. 

1  In this report, “fiscal consolidation” refers to the wide array of adjustment measures adopted to reduce government 
deficits and debt accumulation. Fiscal consolidation policies are often referred to as austerity policies.

The twin objectives of protection are to reach all 
older persons in need and to do so at an appropriate 
monetary level of benefit provision. The available stat-
istics allow much more detailed analysis of the former 
aspect (extent of coverage) than the latter (level of 
benefit), even though the assessment of income security 
in old age requires at the least consideration of these two 
dimensions. In simple terms, the available information 
provides some quantitative data by country as well as at 
the level of region (or other global grouping) on both 
coverage by social security laws and their effective imple-
mentation. Effective implementation can be translated 
into two distinct measures (and the complementary re-
alities), namely the number of people of working age 
actually contributing to a pension scheme (focus on the 
contributory side of pension systems) and the proportion 
of older persons receiving a pension – either contribu-
tory or not – every month, or at least on a regular basis.

4.3   Extent of legal coverage

For most of the world’s population, the right to income 
security in old age is unfulfilled, and considerable in-
equalities persist. Globally, 42.2 per cent of the work-
ing-age population is currently potentially covered by 
existing laws,6 and will therefore receive an old-age pen-
sion once reaching the prescribed age, if these laws are 
properly implemented and enforced (see figure 4.7). 
Coverage for women is lower than for men: only one 
out of three women of working age has some form of 
legal coverage. Women’s lower coverage rates for con-
tributory schemes largely reflect their lower labour 
market participation rates, their over-representation 
among those working as self-employed or unpaid family 
workers, or in agriculture or other sectors frequently 
not covered by existing legislation, and their higher 
likelihood of having shorter and more often interrupted 

6  The extent of legal coverage for old age is defined as the proportion of the working-age population (or alternatively the labour force) 
covered by law with schemes providing periodic cash benefits once statutory pensionable age or other eligible age is reached. The population 
covered is estimated by using the available demographic, employment and other statistics to quantify the size of the groups covered as 
specified in the national legislation. Actual, effective coverage is often significantly lower than legal coverage where laws are not implemented 
fully or enforced. For additional details, see the glossary in Annex I, as well as Annex II.

4.4   Extent of effective coverage

Indicators of the extent of effective coverage attempt 
to measure the extent to which the existing statutory 
framework is actually implemented. Figure 4.8 presents 
global results for two (or rather three) parallel measures 
of effective coverage. The first measure (“beneficiary 
coverage ratio”) shows the percentage of older persons 
above statutory pensionable age receiving contribu-
tory or non-contributory pensions. Focusing on con-
tributory pensions, the second measure (“contributor 
coverage ratio”), in its two variants, provides some in-
dication of future pension coverage: it shows the per-
centages of, respectively, those who are economically 
active (“contributor/labour force coverage ratio”) and 
those of working age (“contributor/population coverage 
ratio”) who contribute to existing contributory pension 
schemes.

careers in formal employment, which constrains their 
ability to contribute to social insurance (or other forms 
of pension insurance). Women whose husbands were 
covered by contributory schemes are in many coun-
tries entitled to survivors’ pensions which often become 
their only source of income.

Overall, levels of legal coverage (mandatory and 
voluntary coverage taken together) range from about 
30 per cent in Asia and the Pacific and 32.8 per cent 
in Africa – where informality and “unorganized sec-
tors” predominate – to 76.4 per cent in North America 
and over 80 per cent in both Western and Central and 
Eastern Europe. Globally, 31.5 per cent of the working-
age population is mandatorily covered by law and may 
receive in future old-age pensions from contributory 
schemes, and just over 4 per cent may become eligi-
ble to receive a non-contributory pension.7 The corres-
ponding rates of legal coverage for women are lower 
(26.4 per cent being covered by mandatory contribu-
tory schemes, and an additional 5 per cent potentially 
covered by universal or pension-tested non-contribu-
tory schemes). In addition, national laws may provide 
for voluntary coverage complementing the mandatory 
provisions.

7  The estimation method adopted tends to underestimate potential legal coverage by non-contributory pension schemes.

4.4.1   Income security in old age:  

A right still unfulfilled for many 

On a global scale, only slightly more than half of older 
persons above statutory pensionable age (51.5 per cent) 
receive an old-age pension (i.e. periodic cash benefits),8 
and if China is excluded the proportion falls to 45.6 per 
cent (see box 4.3).9 Despite an impressive extension of 
pension coverage in many countries (see below), sig-
nificant inequalities persist. In sub-Saharan Africa, less 
than one in five older persons (16.9 per cent) receives an 
old-age pension which would provide him or her with 
a certain level of income security during old age. In 
the Middle East, 29.5 per cent of older persons receive 
a pension; the figure is 36.7 per cent in North Africa, 
47.0 per cent in Asia and the Pacific (32.4 per cent ex-
cluding China), and 56.1 per cent in Latin America and 
the Caribbean. Regional coverage ratios of more than 
90 per cent of older persons are achieved only in North 
America and Europe. 

The contributor coverage ratio gives an indication 
of the proportion of the population – or the labour 
force – which will have access to contributory pen-
sions in the future. Although this measure does not 
reflect access to non-contributory pensions, it still gives 
an important signal regarding future levels of cover-
age, taking into account that benefit levels in contrib-
utory pension schemes tend to be higher than those 
from non-contributory pension schemes. At the global 
level, less than one-third of the working-age population 
(30.9 per cent), just more than a quarter (25.4 per cent) 
excluding China, is contributing to a pension scheme 
(see figure 4.8). Effective coverage ratios range from 
5.9 per cent of the working-age population in sub- 
Saharan Africa to 77.5 per cent of the working-age 
population in North America. 

Focusing on those persons who are economically 
active, 41.4 per cent of the global labour force con-
tribute to a pension insurance scheme, and can there-
fore expect to receive a contributory pension upon

9  As the available data for many countries do not allow for a detailed age breakdown of old-age pensioners, the indicator is calculated as the 
total number of beneficiaries of old-age pensions as a proportion of the population above statutory pensionable age.

Box 4.3  Extension of social protection of older persons in China

Before 2009, only two institutional mechanisms for income security in old age existed in China: one for 
urban workers, based on social insurance principles, and one for civil servants and others of similar status, 
based on the employer’s liability approach. Together, they covered under 250 million people (including 
pensioners), about 23 per cent of the population aged 15 and above in 2008.

In 2009 and 2011, two new old-age pension schemes were introduced for the rural population and 
urban residents otherwise not covered respectively. Participation is voluntary. To encourage people to join, 
the Government employed a number of measures, including contribution subsidies and immediate pen-
sion payments to the elderly parents of adults registered with a rural pension scheme. Pensions consist 
of two components: a social pension paid by the Government, and an individual savings account pension 
financed jointly by contributions from the insured persons, collective entities (if any) and the Government. 
A minimum level is set for the social pension, which can be higher if local governments so wish and are able 
to fund it: this provision partially explains the differences in the levels of pension payments across different 
regions. For contributions to the individual savings account, a minimum level of subsidy from the Govern-
ment is fixed, and personal contribution scales are established to allow each of the insured to choose the 
level of contribution he or she wants to make. 

At the end of 2013, 850 million people, nearly 75 per cent of the population aged 15 and above, were 
covered under the four pension schemes, of which 498 million were covered under the two new schemes, 
accounting for 59 per cent of the total number covered. 

Essential expansion has also been made within the pension system for urban workers, in particular to 

cover rural-to-urban migrant workers, the overall number of whom exceeded 260 million in 2012. 

To consolidate the progress achieved so far and to address issues of adequacy, equality, portability 
and sustainability in a more coherent, effective and efficient manner, in 2013 China began the process of 
overhauling the entire old-age pension system, now comprising the four components outlined above. The 
first outcomes of this review include the policies announced in early 2014 on the merging of the two new 
pension schemes to equalize their rights and opportunities; the portability of pension entitlements between 
the merged scheme and others; and the conversion of employers’ liability for civil servants into a social 
insurance pension scheme.

retirement. Owing to the high proportion of informal 
employment in sub-Saharan Africa, only 8.4 per cent of 
the labour force contributes to pension insurance and 
earns rights to a contributory pension. In Asia and the 
Pacific, about one-third of the labour force (34.0 per 
cent) contributes; coverage ratios are slightly higher in 
the Middle East (37.1 per cent), Latin America and the 
Caribbean (38 per cent), and North Africa (47.4 per 
cent). Western Europe and North America reach cover-
age rates of 89.2 and 98.5 per cent respectively, followed 
by Central and Eastern Europe with 69.7 per cent of 
the labour force. 

In lower-income countries, usually only a very small 
proportion of those employed are wage and salary 
earners with formal employment contracts, and are 
thus relatively easily covered by contributory pensions. 
Informality, evasion and inadequate enforcement of 
laws are also more prevalent in lower-income coun-
tries. That is why effective pension coverage seems to 
be strongly associated with a country’s income level 
(see figure 4.9), although it is in fact labour market 
structures and law enforcement and governance that 

actually exert the crucial influence. While in high-
income economies, 90.8 per cent of the labour force 
contribute to a pension scheme, this is the case for 
only 50.7 per cent in upper-middle-income economies, 
15.2 per cent in lower-middle-income economies, and 
only 5.7 per cent in low-income economies. These low 
coverage ratios tend to be associated with a low degree 
of formality in the labour market. Unless effective 
non-contributory pensions are available, coverage gaps 
also show in the proportion of older persons effectively 
benefiting from a pension: beneficiary coverage ratios 
range from 18.1 per cent in low-income economies 
and 24.1 per cent in lower-middle-income economies 
to 71.0 per cent in upper-middle-income economies 
and 89.1 per cent in high-income economies. 

With efforts to extend contributory schemes to all 
with some contributory capacity, and with the introduc-
tion of non-contributory pensions in a larger number of 
countries, coverage has been extended significantly to 
workers in informal employment, providing at least a 
minimum of income security in old age. These trends 
will be assessed in more detail in the following section.

4.4.2   Changes in pension coverage across 

the world: Progress and regression 

Although effective pension coverage ratios are still 
insufficient, significant progress has been achieved 
in recent years. Whereas in 2000, only 34 countries 
reached high coverage of more than 90 per cent of the 
population above statutory pensionable age, 45 coun-
tries fell into this category in 2010–12 (see figures 4.10 
and 4.11). At the opposite end of the scale, those coun-
tries where pension provision reaches less than 20 per 
cent of older persons numbered 57, according to the 
more recent data, as compared with 73 countries in 
2000. Overall, the data indicate visible improvement 
in coverage.

Many countries experienced a significant increase in 
coverage between 2000 and 2010. Bolivia increased the 
proportion of older persons receiving a pension from 
80.7 to 90.5 per cent between 2000 and 2009, largely 
due to the reform of its Renta Dignidad programme, 
which replaced the Bonosol scheme in 2008. Lesotho’s 
pension-tested old-age pension scheme, launched in 
2004, now provides a pension to all people above the 
age of 70, a benefit available to only 8.4 per cent of 
older persons in 2000. Timor-Leste’s universal Support 
Allowance for the Elderly, introduced in 2008, steeply 
increased coverage rates from 0.5 per cent to 100 per 
cent of people aged 60 and older between 2000 and 
2011. The introduction of the pension-tested Old Age 
Grant in Swaziland in 2005 expanded coverage among 

people aged 60 and older from 1.8 per cent in 2000 to 
96.3 per cent in 2010. By expanding the old-age allow-
ance (introduced in 1993) to all those not in receipt 
of other pensions in 2009, Thailand increased cover-
age ratios from 5 per cent in 2000 to 81.7 per cent of 
people aged 60 and above in 2011. By lowering the 
age threshold of its Old Age Allowance (introduced in 
1995) in 2008, Nepal increased its coverage ratio from 
33 per cent to 62.5 per cent of people aged 58 and over 
between 2000 and 2010. China, after increasing po-
tential future pension coverage from 24.4 per cent to 
74.4 per cent of the population over statutory pension-
able age between 2000 and 2011, planned to extend 
its pension system further towards universal coverage 
with the decision in 2012 to expand the “new” rural 
pension scheme piloted in 2009 and the pilot social 
pension insurance for urban residents launched in 
2011 to all counties, aiming at nearly doubling statu-
tory pension insurance coverage by the end of 2015 
(see box 4.3). Tunisia improved pension coverage for 
the self-employed, domestic workers, farmers, fishers 
and other low-income groups in 2002, helping to in-
crease the proportion of pension beneficiaries among 
people aged 60 and over from 33.9 per cent in 2000 
to 68.8 per cent in 2006. In many countries, the ex-
tension of coverage was made possible mainly through 
the establishment or extension of non-contributory 
pension schemes which provide at least a basic level of 
protection for many older persons, while others have 
combined the expansion of contributory schemes to 

88

previously uncovered groups of the population with 
other measures.10

The impressive extension of pension coverage in 
some parts of the world contrasts with a contraction 
in others between 2000 and 2010 (see figure 4.11). 
The latter include several countries, including Albania, 
Azerbaijan and Greece, which had previously achieved 
coverage rates close to 90 per cent or higher in 2000, 
and which suffered a significant decrease thereafter. 

4.4.3   Persistent inequalities in access  

to income security in old age

Access to income security in old age is closely associ-
ated with existing inequalities in the labour market 
and in employment. Such inequalities become evident 
from examination of a disaggregation of coverage rates 
by gender and by area of residence (rural/urban), which 
are the focus of this section (see figures 4.12 and 4.13).11
Older women tend to face higher risk of poverty 
than men. There are many underlying reasons for this, 
not least the fact that the greater longevity of women re-
sults in predominance at the oldest ages of women with 
poor levels of support and livelihood (UNFPA and 
HelpAge International, 2012; UNRISD, 2010). This is 
because pension systems in many countries fail to meet 
the needs of men and women equitably: contributory 
pension coverage of women tends to be significantly 
lower than men’s, and the amounts received by women 
on average tend to be lower (Razavi et al., 2012). While 
these inequities may be partly due to the gender-biased 
design of pension schemes (e.g. lower pensionable age 
for women, or the application of sex-specific mortality 
tables to calculate benefit levels which result in women 
receiving lower pensions than men with the same con-
tribution record and retirement age), in many cases a 
more significant driver of gender inequality is found in 
the interaction between the results of discrimination 
against women in the labour market and the design 
of pension schemes, which does not compensate for 
differences deriving from labour market conditions 
and sometimes even magnifies them (Behrendt and 
Woodall, forthcoming). The fundamental problem is 

that for many women it is not possible to accrue pen-
sion rights on an equal basis with their male counter-
parts. Women’s share in wage employment, particularly 
in formal wage employment, has historically been lower 
than men’s and continues to be so in many part of the 
world (ILO, 2012d). Also, women who work in wage 
employment systematically earn less than men (ILO, 
2014c), which also affects the level of their contribu-
tions to contributory pension schemes. As women tend 
to take on a greater share of family responsibilities, they 
are more likely to shorten or interrupt their employ-
ment careers, and face a higher risk of working in pre-
carious and informal employment, which also affects 
their ability to build up pension entitlements. These 
factors lead to relatively low pension benefits where 
these are calculated on an earnings-related basis, unless 
effective measures are put in place to compensate for 
gender inequalities. Non-contributory pensions can 
play a key role in ensuring women’s access to at least a 
basic pension, yet benefit levels are often not sufficient 
to fully meet their needs.

It is clear, too, that closing the gap in pension pro-
vision between women and men is closely linked to 
the issue of providing equitably for rural and urban 
residents (see figures 4.12 and 4.13). In many parts of 
the world, women are disproportionately represented 
among the rural population, where paid work, even if 
available, is likely to be relatively poorly paid, informal 
and insecure – reflecting, in part at least, the movement 
of men to cities in search of better-paid work at the 
more formalized end of the labour market spectrum. 
At the same time, the growing importance of non-con-
tributory pensions in the provision of old-age income 
is clearly helping to bridge the coverage gap between 
men and women to some extent. For instance, in Cabo 
Verde, 41.4 per cent of women above retirement age 
are receiving the non-contributory pension (31.6 per 
cent of men); the proportions in rural areas are respec-
tively 53.6 and 42.1 per cent. At the same time, women 
are less likely than men to receive a contributory pen-
sion (11.4 per cent compared to 28.2 per cent), espe-
cially in rural areas (8 per cent of women and 22.2 per 
cent of men).12 In the case of the Plurinational State of 
Bolivia, the proportion of older women receiving the 

10  While the extension of coverage constitutes significant progress towards guaranteeing at least a basic level of income security for older 
persons, a remaining challenge is ensuring the adequacy of pension levels (see below).
11  As part of the research undertaken to prepare this report, the Social Protection Department of the ILO produced a separate study on 
social protection for rural women, which includes more detailed discussion of their pension coverage and will be published separately.

non-contributory Renta Dignidad only (as opposed to 
receiving a reduced level of Renta Dignidad in add-
ition to a contributory pension) is significantly higher 
than that of men, both at a national level (83.3 per cent 

compared to 66.3 per cent of men), and in rural areas 
(90.6 per cent of women and 78.4 per cent of men).13

More optimistic prospects may nevertheless be seen 
in a number of nascent trends that address inequality

in pension coverage. There are efforts everywhere to 
expand the effective coverage of contributory schemes 
to at least some categories of self-employed and other 
workers with contributory capacity.14 Measures to 
extend the coverage of contributory schemes to agricul-
tural and rural workers in some countries (e.g. Brazil) 
have contributed to a further narrowing of the rural–
urban gap in pension coverage, although significant 
inequalities persist. In addition, the establishment of 
large-scale non-contributory pension schemes in many 
countries has expanded the effective coverage and re-
duced inequalities, both between the genders and 
between rural and urban populations. 

Gender equality considerations are gaining some 
ground in the public debate on pensions. Proactive 
policy measures have been implemented in some coun-
tries to reduce the effect of differentiated career pat-
terns on old-age income security. The most obvious 
discriminatory elements and parameters of national 
pension schemes, such as the differential pension ages 
which were common until recently, are rapidly being 
eliminated, albeit in the context of general increases in 
pension ages for both women and men.

Other steps in the same direction include credit-
ing pension accounts during maternity, paternity and 
parental leave, and a better recognition of care work 
undertaken by both women and men. Measures to fa-
cilitate a more equal sharing of care responsibilities 
between women and men contribute to addressing 
some of the inequalities in the labour market and in 
social protection more broadly, and may be reflected 
in a reduction of gender inequalities in labour markets 
and pension systems in the long run.15

As with so many other aspects of social protection, 
those relating to the promotion of equitable treatment 
of women and men must, if they are to be addressed 
effectively and in a spirit of social justice, be dealt with 
on a basis which fully integrates labour market and 
social protection policy-making.

4.5   The adequacy of pensions to provide 

genuine income security to older persons

In any society, what kind of retirement provisions are 
considered adequate depends on the prevailing atti-
tudes on such matters as the distribution of responsi-
bility between individuals and the State, redistribution 
and the support to be provided to the poor and vulner-
able, and intergenerational solidarity. At what age re-
tirement happens, what level of income security should 
be guaranteed and to whom, what degree of intergener-
ational solidarity should be expected in financing pen-
sions – these are the issues which are usually agreed as 
underpinning partially implicit and partially explicit 
social contracts. These social contracts, and the atti-
tudes behind them, evolve over time as social, cultural, 
demographic and economic conditions change. They 
are also reflected in international labour standards or 
human rights instruments. 

4.5.1   Guaranteeing income replacement 

Any attempt to make a comparative assessment of the 
performance of national pension systems in meeting 
their relevant objectives today is beset by many compli-
cations. The first is that it is very hard to find a compa-
rable benchmark. One possible solution is to compare 
the average level of pensions received to the average level 
of earnings in the economy, as a national snapshot at a 
given point in time of the relative income situation of 
pensioners compared to the situation of the employed 
population. Unfortunately, while the data necessary for 
such a comparison are available and widely presented 
in various OECD and EU reports, it is still practically 
impossible to replicate the exercise on a wider scale for 
countries outside these groups, mainly due to lack of 
comparable earnings statistics as well as the limited 
availability of the household survey data that would 
enable such comparisons.16

Such estimates of income replacement rates pro-
vided by pension schemes after retirement are, how-
ever, important measures of the degree to which those 

14  Opening up the legal opportunity to contribute on a voluntary basis (as, for example, has been done in Indonesia, Mongolia, Thailand 
and Viet Nam, and in some countries in other regions of the world) does not in itself necessarily secure an effective increase in coverage. To 
ensure this, additional measures are necessary, including subsidizing the contributions of those with low incomes.
15  For example, in the case of parental leave, measures to encourage a greater engagement of fathers (e.g. in Sweden or Germany) in sharing 
care responsibilities can help to reduce discrimination against women in the labour market, which may have a long-term effect on gender 
inequalities in access to adequate pensions.
16  Also, such an indicator has a very narrow interpretation in countries where wage earners in the formal economy form only a minority of 
the population, and thus average wage levels have a very weak relationship with the much lower average household income.

World Social Protection Report 2014/154. Social protection for older women and men: Pensions and other non-health benefits

schemes provide adequate benefits for those covered by 
them (see box 4.4). Other indicators may relate pension 
amounts to average household incomes, to GDP per 
capita or to poverty lines. The problem is that, while 
they may be useful in analysing the adequacy of pen-
sion systems within the respective countries, and in 
comparing the quality of coverage of different groups 
provided by different schemes, they are not comparable 
between countries with different extents and patterns 
of coverage. For this reason, and owing to the limita-
tions in data availability, this report does not include 
global or regional estimates of the replacement rates 
and other aspects of quality of pension coverage beyond 
the OECD.17

4.5.2   Preventing erosion of the value of pensions 

over time: Ensuring regular adjustments

As old-age pensions are drawn for many years after they 
are initially calculated and awarded, the questions of 
what happens over the years to their purchasing power 
and real value, how much those retired have to reduce 
their standards of living the longer they live after the 
moment of retirement, what their income position is 
relative to other groups of the society, and what are the 
risks of their falling into poverty, are extremely im-
portant. Mechanisms to protect the value of pensions in 
payment through more or less regular pension increases 
are sometimes referred to as “cost-of-living” adjustments 
or indexation, and how this is done effects greatly the 
standard of living of long-term pensioners.

Conventions Nos 102 and 128 both call for levels of 
benefits in payment to be reviewed following substan-
tial changes in levels of earnings or of costs of living, 
while Recommendation No. 131 explicitly stipulates 
that benefit levels should be periodically adjusted taking 
into account changes in the general level of earnings 
or costs of living. Recommendation No. 202 requires 
social protection floor guarantee levels to be reviewed 
regularly through a transparent procedure that is estab-
lished by national laws, regulations or practice.

The practice of indexation varies across countries 

and schemes, as shown in table 4.1.

While wage indexation was more popular in the 
past, nowadays more and more schemes guarantee at 
the best only increases in line with cost of living in-
creases. The choice of an indexation method may 
appear to be a technical detail, but can have a signifi-
cant impact on the level of pensions, and as a conse-
quence, expenditure on pensions. Where wages increase 
faster than prices, the change from wage-based index-
ation to price-based indexation offers significant re-
ductions in pension expenditure, but also leads to the 
decoupling of pensioners’ living standards from those of 
the working population. The evolution of indexation in 
Hungary can be taken as an example of a more general 
trend: in the 1990s indexation of pensions moved from 
wage indexation to a 50:50 mix of price and wage indi-
ces, and recently during the crisis was shifted further to 
pure wage indexation. Other countries have changed 
their indexation policy for pensions in payment in a 
less generous direction: Finland (from 50:50 between 
earnings and prices to 80 per cent prices and 20 per 
cent earnings), France (wages to prices), Poland (various 
changes, most recently from 20:80 earnings:prices to 
100 per cent prices) and Slovakia (100 per cent wages to 
50:50 wages and prices) (OECD, 2012a, p. 58). Spain 
decided in 2013 to delink pension adjustment from any 
standard of living indices and will not allow benefit 
 adjustments higher than 0.25 per cent per annum for a 
certain time.

17  The OECD in collaboration with the World Bank has made some attempts to calculate replacement indicators beyond EU and OECD 
countries, specifically regarding replacement rates provided by pension systems in different countries for hypothetical individuals with 
different levels of earnings and contributory past service (see Whitehouse, 2012); however, these are not yet included in the World Bank 
Pension Database. HelpAge’s Global AgeWatch Index (HelpAge International, 2013) looks at the overall income situation of older people, 
not specifically at the levels of protection provided by existing pension systems. Within the AgeWatch Index, income security of older 
persons is measured by three indicators: percentage of older persons receiving pensions, relative poverty rates of the elderly, and relative 
income position of the elderly (average incomes of those over 60 as a proportion of average incomes of the rest of the population).

Other schemes, including many in Africa, have pro-
vided at the best only occasional, ad hoc increases. This 
results, particularly in inflationary environments, in a 
majority of pensioners eventually receiving only a min-
imal pension, and many of them falling into poverty 
even though before retirement they were high-earning 
professionals. 

Figure 4.14 shows how pensions in payment lose 
their relative purchasing power if not increased at 
the same rate as wages under conditions of real wage 
growth (assuming moderate real wage growth of 2 per 
cent and inflation of only 2 per cent18).

Reducing the frequency of adjustments, or suspend-
ing them totally, severely and immediately affects the 
standard of living of pensioners and their families. 
Unless pensions are adjusted in line with increases 
in real wages or some other measure of overall living 
standards, the further men and women are beyond the 
moment of retirement, the larger the gap between their 
living standards and those of people who are still eco-
nomically active. This widening gap may exacerbate 
the economic and social exclusion of older persons as it 
may mean, among other things, that they cannot afford 

18  In many countries, rates of inflation are much higher 
than this and, as a result, the erosion of pensions’ absolute 
purchasing power progresses much faster in the absence of 
regular and adequate indexation. In some countries, the 
majority of beneficiaries receive pensions at the minimum 
pension level a few years after retirement.

Box 4.4  Trends in replacement rates 
and adequacy of pension payments

One of the great achievements of pension policies in 
many European countries and in some other parts 
of the world in the years following the Second World 
War was to dramatically reduce poverty in old age. 
However, recent developments in the labour market, 
as well as some policy reforms, increase the risk of a 
resurgence of old-age poverty.

While most countries protected the income of 
older persons relatively well during the recent crisis, 
there are exceptions. Countries that either continu-
ously adjust pensions (including the lowest ones) at 
a significantly lower rate than the increase in wages 
or average incomes (e.g. Poland, where pensions are 
adjusted at only 20 per cent of real wage growth) or 
suspend pension adjustments (as Sweden did during 
the crisis as a result of its automatic balancing mech-
anism) experienced an increase in relative poverty of 
their older populations. Between 2005 and 2012, 
poverty rates among retired people increased from 
10 to 18 per cent in Sweden and from 7 to 14 per 
cent in Poland. 

This trend may spread in the future to other coun-
tries as well. Many pension reforms undertaken to 
stabilize future costs of pension systems will re-
sult in much lower benefits. Figure 4.15 presents 
changes in future replacement rates of public pen-
sion schemes in EU countries. In some countries 
the expected decrease in replacement rate is very 
significant. In addition, as many reforms removed re-
distributive mechanisms from contributory schemes, 
these lower replacement rates will apply also to those 
with low earnings throughout their working lives.

According to Eurostat, in 2010 17 per cent of em-
ployees in the EU (over 21 per cent of women and 
over 13 per cent of men) had earnings below the 
“low-earnings” threshold (defined as two-thirds of 
median earnings). The highest proportions of low-
wage-earners were in Latvia (27.8 per cent), Lithu-
ania (27.2 per cent), Romania (25.6 per cent), Poland 
(24.2 per cent) and Estonia (23.8 per cent), while the 
lowest were in Sweden (2.5 per cent, Finland (5.9 per 
cent), France (6.1 per cent), Belgium (6.4 per cent) 
and Denmark (7.7 per cent).1

What minimum replacement rates would guar-
antee those low-wage-earners a future pension in-
come above the poverty line? As figure 4.16 shows, 
countries would need to provide replacement rates 
of between 50 and 90 per cent of previous earn-
ings to prevent poverty in old age for those on low-
incomes.

In  what  are  often  considered  “old-fashioned” 
defined-benefit social security pension schemes, re-
distributive benefit formulas (usually with a flat rate 
component or equivalent) used to guarantee such 
higher replacement rates for low-wage-earners.  "

World Social Protection Report 2014/154. Social protection for older women and men: Pensions and other non-health benefits

Today, many countries have removed those redistributive formulas when introducing either defined-con-
tribution or notional defined contribution (NDC) components or converting defined-benefit schemes into 
purely earnings-related schemes. In this situation, securing a sufficient level of benefits for low-paid workers 
would require strengthening minimum benefit provisions, by means including various forms of non-contrib-
utory minimum income guarantees.

to access new, modern technologies and new goods 
and services changing the lives of more affluent groups 
in society. In cases where pensions are not even fully 
adjusted to inflation – which is quite common glob-
ally – the absolute purchasing power of older persons 
deteriorates and they are pushed into poverty. 

The effects of incomplete adjustments of pensions 
that prevent older persons from keeping up with rising 
overall living standards are rendered more dramatic by 
the technological advances in health care that every-
where are pushing up its costs, and the costs of related 
goods and services, at a faster pace than average infla-
tion – while at the same time, with increasing age the 
need for more (and more sophisticated) health care and 
related services increases dramatically. As older persons 
in many countries have to pay a substantial propor-
tion of the costs of health care and other care services 
out of their own pockets, many of them are at grave 
risk of either exclusion from access to the health care 
they need or financial ruin for themselves and their 
families.

Nonetheless, as suspending or delaying indexation 
of benefits brings immediate and significant reductions 
in public spending, in particular in demographically 
“old” countries with matured pension systems and large 
numbers of pensioners, it is often seen and used by gov-
ernments as one of the instruments to contain public 
spending. The OECD noted that “governments fre-
quently override indexation rules … in a pro-cyclical 
way: pension increases are larger than the rules require 
when the public finances are healthy while increases 
are postponed or reduced in times of fiscal constraint” 
(OECD, 2012a, pp. 59–60). Several countries (includ-
ing Canada, Germany, Japan, Portugal and Sweden) 
have explicitly linked indexation to certain indicators 
of sustainability. The problem is that – as became clear 
during the recent economic and financial crisis – such 
mechanisms may result even in absolute benefit cuts in 
times of crisis.

4.6   Reforming and re-reforming  

pension systems

ILO social security standards provide guidelines re-
specting different dimensions of benefit adequacy (age 
of eligibility and other entitlement conditions, benefit 
levels and protection of purchasing power) and at the 
same time require careful monitoring of the long-
term financial situation of pension schemes through 
actuarial valuations undertaken both regularly and 

whenever any important parameters of the scheme 
change. Policy decisions to adjust and reform schemes 
and systems are, however, left to governments and 
their social partners.

Unfortunately, practice in many countries shows 
that even if actuarial valuations are undertaken on a 
regular basis and lead to recommendations for reform, 
actual reforms are often significantly delayed or do 
not happen at all. One of the main reasons for this 
is that while decisions on pension systems have a very 
long-term character and affect not only living but also 
future generations, politicians taking these decisions 
have much shorter time horizons within the electoral 
cycle. In addition, there is always the temptation to use 
pension fund reserves – both public and private – as a 
kind of “piggy bank”, which can be raided – as experi-
ence in many countries over recent years shows – to 
repair the public finances or bail out the private sector 
(Casey, 2014). Use of pension fund reserves for pur-
poses other than financing current and future pensions 
is proof of bad governance and should not be taking 
place.

There are, however, many countries where effective 
solutions were found which allow the adequacy and 
sustainability of pension systems to be held in balance 
through democratic policy dialogues well informed 
by independent expertise, and where reforms are im-
plemented with a broad consensus across the political 
spectrum and spanning different interests, guarantee-
ing long-lasting effects. There is no recipe to be identi-
fied which would work in every country; each country 
has to find a solution which fits its specific social and 
political environment. There are many studies by the 
ILO and others analysing different solutions and pro-
cesses and identifying good practice as well as prob-
lems and challenges (e.g. Eurofound, 2013; Sarfati and 
 Ghellab, 2012; Ghellab, Varela and Woodall, 2011; 
Reynaud, 2000).

Conversely, in many countries in Europe and else-
where over recent decades the balance between ad-
equacy and sustainability concerns was endangered. 
Assertions of a “social security crisis” or “old-age crisis” 
have been used as a justification to introduce reforms 
which substantially reduce the future adequacy of 
benefits and significantly increase the risk of poverty 
in old age for future generations of retirees (see Euro-
pean Commission, 2012d; OECD, 2013a). Pressures 
of tax competition and global financial markets limit 
governments’ ostensibly sovereign power to introduce 
increases in social security contributions and taxes 
where necessary to prevent benefit cuts. Lobbying by 

World Social Protection Report 2014/154. Social protection for older women and men: Pensions and other non-health benefits

the international financial services sector was success-
ful in pushing for large-scale privatizations of social 
security pensions (Hagemejer and Scholz, 2004; Hage-
mejer, 2005) – though these were reversed in a number 
of countries in the wake of the financial and economic 
crisis (see box 4.5). Social dialogue mechanisms failed in 
a number of cases to reach a consensus with the social 
partners on how and to what extent to bring about in-
creases in the (effective average) age at which individuals 
start to draw pension benefits, and on how labour mar-
kets should be reorganized and regulated so as to better 
meet the needs of increasing numbers of those older 
persons who wish to, or indeed need to, continue in 
employment to significantly greater ages than previ-
ously considered appropriate.

These failures to agree on necessary reforms through 
social dialogue and implement them through well-in-
formed and deliberate policy-making has led many 
countries to adopt too readily a “hands-off” approach 
to their governance of the pension system (Woodall 
and Hagemejer, 2009), through partial privatization 
but also through various “automatic balancing mech-
anisms”. These include linking accrual rates used to 
calculate pensions in social security schemes automat-
ically to life expectancy at retirement (as in countries 
which introduced NDC schemes, but also in Brazil in 
the case of early-retirement pensions, as well as in many 
other countries), or automatically linking the age of 
pension eligibility to life expectancy (as in Denmark, 
France, Greece and Italy). This took most extreme form 
in Sweden, where changes in value of one indicator 
(“balance ratio”) deemed to reflect the long-term finan-
cial position of the pension scheme not only affect the 
future pension entitlements of contributors, but may 
also lead to reductions in the amounts of pension paid 
to current pensioners (as happened in the middle of the 
financial and economic crisis). 

“Solutions” of this kind would automatically, with-
out intervention of policy-makers and without discus-
sions among the social partners, adjust benefit levels, 
indexation formulas, retirement ages and numbers of 
years of contributions required to receive a full pen-
sion, according to certain selected statistical indicators 
(linked to life expectancy at retirement or to certain 
ratios between revenue or assets of a scheme and its ex-
penditure or liability). One of the ways to achieve such 
automatic (downward) adjustments of benefit levels to 
the changing demographic and economic conditions is 
to expand the defined contribution components of pen-
sion systems, as has happened in many countries across 
the world. Such “automatic pilots” are however also 

95

built in into “notional” defined-contribution schemes 
in countries including Italy, Latvia, Norway, Poland 
and in particular Sweden, where the “automatic bal-
ancing mechanism” in addition regulates the pace of 
indexation of benefits and the valorization of past con-
tributions. They are also present in the form of various 
“sustainability factors” in different “point” schemes 
(such as those in Germany and France, and outside 
Europe in Canada or Japan). Some countries, including 
Denmark, France, Greece and Italy, have linked future 
increases in the pensionable age to future changes in life 
expectancy. 

Most of these automatic mechanisms lead ultimately 
to downward adjustments of benefit levels to ensure fi-
nancial sustainability. In only two OECD countries 
(Canada and Germany) are there mechanisms that may 
result in an increase of the effective contribution rate 
(Di Addio and Whitehouse, 2012). Apart from min-
imum pension guarantees – where they exist – there are 
no similar automatic mechanisms which would adjust 
the system to ensure that benefits are adequate. Even 
automatic adjustments of benefits in payment to price 
changes are reduced or totally eliminated.

These automatic mechanisms focus solely on the 
objective of ensuring the long-term financial sustain-
ability of pension systems, while at the same time 
trying to sidestep open policy debates and social dia-
logue, which are seen as obstacles preventing timely 
adoption of necessary policy changes. The conse-
quences of this approach are very severe, as the absence 
of any corresponding automatic mechanisms to secure 
desired levels of adequacy undermines the necessary 
balance between adequacy and sustainability concerns. 
In addition, in the short term some of these mech-
anisms cause pro-cyclical change in the amounts of 
benefits paid. Joseph Stiglitz drew attention to this 
phenomenon in 2009: 

When the economy gets weaker, spending on 
social protection and unemployment schemes 
should automatically go up, helping to stabilize 
the economy. However, … one of the sad facts of 
the so-called reforms in recent decades is that we 
have been weakening these important automatic 
stabilizers. The extent of progressivity in tax sys-
tems has been lowered, and we have moved from 
defined benefit systems to defined contribution 
retirement systems, again weakening the auto-
matic stabilizers of the economy and in some 
cases converting them into automatic destabilizers  
(Stiglitz, 2009, pp. 4–5).

Box 4.5  Re-reforms and “un-privatizations” of pension systems  

in Latin America and Central and Eastern Europe

Between 1981 and 2008, 11 Latin American countries completely or partially privatized their public pay-as-
you-go pension systems. Such reforms also spread at the end of the 1990s and the beginning of the new 
millennium in most of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, where a proportion of social security 
contributions (in some countries, such as Hungary, Poland and Slovakia, up to one-third) were channelled 
out of public social security pensions into mandatory, privately managed individual accounts. However, 
during the past few years these privatizations have come to a halt, and in some countries have been re-
versed, while public provision was reintroduced or strengthened.

In Chile, where the “new paradigm” was introduced as early as 1981, enough time elapsed to show that 
the new system not only did not enhance coverage and compliance as expected but was also unable to 
provide adequate income security in old age, especially to those with low earnings and shorter, broken 
careers (and in particular to women). Chile was thus also the first country to initiate a re-reform. In 2008 
the existing mandatory, privately managed fully funded scheme was complemented by two new public 
schemes: a basic universal pension for the 60 per cent of the population on lower incomes without pension 
provision (Pensión Básica Solidaria, PBS) and, alternatively, a government-funded supplement to those with 
very low pensions (Aporte Previsional Solidario, APS). Moreover, President Bachelet is creating a Public 
AFP (pension fund). To reduce the administration costs of the private pension tier, public supervision was 
strengthened and greater competition among pension fund administrators was encouraged. 

Other countries in the region have also implemented substantial re-reforms of their pension systems: 
Argentina in 2008, the Plurinational State of Bolivia in 2010 and Uruguay in 2013. While the first two 
countries completely eliminated the private pillar, Uruguay, like Chile, retained it, but improved supervision 
and strengthened the public pillar. The main objectives of all these reforms are to improve coverage and 
adequacy by expanding (Argentina), universalizing (Plurinational State of Bolivia) or introducing (Chile) non-
contributory schemes. 

One of the aspects of the re-reforms was to scale down the size of mandatory individual account schemes. 
This scaling down has two main objectives: first, to make pensions more secure again, and, second, to ease 
the pressure on the public finances from the need to fill the gap in funding for public provision after a 
proportion of contributions was channelled into private funds.

Full or partial renationalizations of assets accumulated in mandatory private pension schemes took place 
in Argentina and the Plurinational State of Bolivia in Latin America, and elsewhere in Hungary, Kazakhstan 
and Poland. A number of countries (including Lithuania, Poland, the Russian Federation, Slovakia and, for 
some categories of workers, Uruguay) made the privately managed sector voluntary, allowing people to opt 
out and go back to public provision. During the years of the crisis, most countries with mandatory private 
pension schemes in Europe either temporarily or permanently reduced or froze the stream of contribu-
tions allocated to private pension funds, keeping them for the public system, which was in most cases in 
significant deficit.

While the Chilean re-reform was clearly done with the objective of building a floor of protection so that 
everybody on reaching old age will have a guarantee of at least minimum income security (an objective that 
also played a strong role in the Plurinational State of Bolivia), other countries, in particular those of Central 
and Eastern Europe, were to a large extent motivated by public finance concerns, with a view to reducing 
budgetary deficits and public debt. In countries such as Poland, Hungary and Slovakia, privatization of 
social security pensions has been adding about 1.5 per cent of GDP every year to national deficits. As 
private pension funds invested most of their assets in bonds issued by governments to cover – among other 
things – deficits caused by channelling contributions to private pension funds, one can understand the 
radical decisions taken by some governments to stop this circular flow of money which seemed to benefit 
only the incomes of private pension administrators. The Polish Government, for example, not only cut con-
tributions to the funded tier from 7.3 per cent to 2.9 per cent of wages and made participation voluntary 
(and required current members to reconfirm they want to continue rather than be transferred, with their as-
sets, to the public tier), but in 2014 is transferring all assets kept in government bonds to a social insurance 
institution and banning any further investments by the remaining funded tier.

4.7   Ensuring income security for older 
persons: The continuing challenge

Today, the majority of the world’s older persons live in 
developing countries, where retirement is a privilege 
of public and private sector workers who are fortunate 
to work in the formal economy. Globally, the broad 
majority of older persons do not benefit from publicly 
provided minimum income guarantees, have to work 
as long as they are physically able to for their survival, 
and have to rely on kinship and charity which are often 
insufficient to provide even basic income security. This 
situation stands in sharp contrast with the global social 
contract embodied in human rights instruments and 
international labour standards, under which every-
body has a right to at least minimum income security 
in old age.

Fortunately, attitudes are changing and are followed 
by policy actions: more and more countries across the 
world are seeking to expand their contributory pensions 
to those who are not currently covered but potentially 
have sufficient contributory capacity to participate. 
Many countries are also expanding non-contributory 
provisions in the form of so-called “social pensions”, 
available either universally to all who reach a certain age 
threshold or to those who have no or insufficient pen-
sion or other income, which provide at least a modest 
regular income to older persons. 

There are of course questions to be addressed relat-
ing to the balance between the adequacy of benefits 
and their affordability, and to the long-term financial 
and fiscal sustainability of pension schemes. Establish-
ing a pension system is a long-term commitment, and 
long-term balances between future benefit costs and 
available means of financing have to be regularly moni-
tored (as, indeed, has been explicitly required from the 
outset by international labour standards). If people 
live longer but pensionable age is not proportionally 

adjusted (that is, if the duration of retirement and 
of the period during which pensions are received in-
creases relative to the duration of economic activity 
and of contributory period), the costs of pensions will 
unavoidably increase unless benefit levels are cut. 

Affordability depends on the existence of policy 
space for the objective of guaranteeing income se-
curity in old age: if such space exists (that is, if there is 
a political willingness to implement such guarantees), 
the way is usually open to create the necessary fiscal 
space as well (after assessing the opportunity costs of 
allocating resources to this and not to other ends). 
However, support for pension financing, the ensuing 
policy choices, and the corresponding fiscal space may 
erode over time if coverage and benefits cease to be 
perceived as adequate and just, or if governance and 
delivery fail.

As noted above, the sustainability of pension sys-
tems seems to be quite well guarded in many coun-
tries. However, what is missing is an equally careful 
monitoring of benefit adequacy, and of the social and 
economic impacts of ongoing benefit reductions. The 
conclusions and recommendations that arise from such 
monitoring should feed into policy dialogue involving 
all stakeholders, and should also lead to changes in the 
application of “automatic pilots” if they put the system 
on the wrong track.

Adequacy and sustainability are two sides of the 
same coin: promises of generous pensions not balanced 
by sustainable financing will never materialize, while, 
on the other hand, if a low-cost pension system is not 
accepted as adequate, the willingness to pay the taxes 
and contributions necessary to finance it will erode. 
What is needed vmeasures that ensure a genuine bal-
ance between adequacy and sustainability – a balance 
which can only be achieved through real and demo-
cratic social dialogue resulting in a renewed and reinvig-
orated social contract on pensions.

Towards universal 
coverage in health 

5

9999

KEY MESSAGES
 n The ILO’s pioneering role in the foundation of universal coverage in health protection dates 
back to 1944, when the Declaration of Philadelphia and the Medical Care Recommendation, 
1944 (No. 69), were adopted. Most recently, the ILO was requested, along with the WHO and 
other UN agencies, to give high priority to working jointly towards universal health coverage, 
and towards the associated goal of establishing social protection floors, by the UN General 
Assembly.

 n The urgency of striving for universal coverage in health is illustrated by the fact that more 
than 90 per cent of the population living in low-income countries remains without any right 
to coverage in health. Globally, about 39 per cent of the population is lacking such coverage. 
As a result, about 40 per cent of global health expenditure is shouldered directly by the sick. 
 n Despite coverage, health care is frequently neither available nor affordable, and access to 
needed services can lead to poverty. As a result, much of the coverage that exists is illusory. 
Often, even people who are legally covered experience limited health benefits, high out-of-
pocket payments and a lack of the health workers needed to deliver services.

 n The ILO estimates that there is a global shortfall of 10.3 million health workers required to 
ensure that all in need receive quality health services. This gap, and the often close-to-poverty 
wages of health workers, are blocking progress towards universal health coverage.

 n Globally, 88 countries in all regions have proved that it is possible to close the gaps in health 
coverage. Many of them began the process of reform at lower levels of national income and 
invested in times of economic crisis. Further, they have shown that countries can achieve high 
coverage rates and even universal coverage irrespective of the financing mechanisms chosen. 
 n Investing  in  health  protection,  including  paid  sick  leave,  yields  returns.  However,  public 
expenditure on health protection is at present too low to be sufficiently effective: the poten-
tial economic returns from increased productivity and employment cannot be realized while 
gaps in coverage persist. Closing these gaps would lead to the highest rates of return in the 
world’s poorest countries.

 n Fiscal consolidation measures have sharpened inequities in access to health care and increased 
exclusion by shifting the burden from the public purse to private households. Further, fiscal 
consolidation measures have blocked economic recovery by reducing the effectiveness and 
efficiency of health protection.

 n Significant investments in health protection and coherent policy approaches across the health, 
social and economic sectors are needed to address inequities in access to health care and 
realize the potential of health protection as an economic stabilizer.

5.1   The crucial role of universal health 

coverage for individuals and the economy 

(working) population and the economy are beneficiar-
ies of investments in social health protection.

Health coverage, and particularly access to health care 
when it is needed, is crucial for human well-being. In 
addition, of all the elements of social protection, health 
care is most essential to the economy as a whole and to 
economic recovery in particular. In developing coun-
tries the economic returns on investing in health are 
estimated at 24 per cent of economic growth between 
2000 and 2011, taking into account increases in both 
national income and life years gained (The Lancet 
Commission, 2013). The economic impacts of invest-
ments in health care may be summarized as follows: 
•  development and economic growth, through in-
creased labour productivity; a growing labour force 
due to reductions in disability, mortality and life 
expectancy; the contribution of the health sector 
itself to economic activity; increased household con-
sumption opportunities as a result of reduced out-
of-pocket expenditure;

100

•  productivity increases through reduced absenteeism;
•  employment effects and job growth arising from the 
improved physical capacities of workers and from 
both direct employment in the health sector and 
multiplier effects in industry, local businesses and 
other sectors;
stabilization of the economy in times of crises, by 
cushioning the impacts of economic crises on indi-
vidual health and ensuring continued employment 
for those in the health sector and related sectors;
income generation, based on increased ability to 
work;

• 

• 

•  poverty alleviation, through minimizing the private 
health expenditure of those who are poor or near to 
poverty.

• 

In the longer term, growing tax bases arising from the 
indirect economic effects of investments in health will 
generate more public funds at national level, particu-
larly in low- and middle-income countries. 

Against this background, health protection schemes 
and systems that are well designed and implemented, 
and are embedded in appropriate economic and labour 
market policies, have the potential to recover large 
parts of their costs at the national level. Thus, both the 

1  These criteria have been set out in UN, 2000.

5.2   The foundation of universal  

coverage in health in international  
labour standards

Given the critical importance of human health both to 
individuals and to social and economic development, it 
is important that countries and development partners 
across the world be aligned in support of the objective of 
establishing universal coverage. In recognition of this im-
perative, health coverage has been at the core of the ILO 
mandate since its foundation in 1919 (see box 5.1). The ex-
tension of such coverage to all in need has been a priority 
since 1944, as stated in the Declaration of  Philadelphia. 
The first formulation of guidance to achieve universal 
coverage dates back to the same year, when ILO constitu-
ents adopted the Medical Care  Recommendation, 1944 
(No. 69), which states: “The medical care service should 
cover all members of the community, whether or not 
they are gainfully occupied” (Para. 8). 

Since then, this objective and the specific means for 
its realization have been spelled out in numerous ILO 
Conventions and Recommendations, most recently in 
the Social Protection Floors Recommendation, 2012 
(No. 202), which emphasizes that in each country, all 
residents and children should be guaranteed access to 
health care, and that this should include at least essen-
tial health care, prevention and maternal care, financed 
through social protection systems and schemes so as to 
avoid financial access barriers, e.g. through excessive 
out-of-pocket payments. 

Recommendation No. 202 specifies the need for:
legal health coverage by a health protection system 
or scheme, e.g. through entitlements to benefits pre-
scribed by national law; that is, rights-based pro-
tection (in contrast to charitable provision, for 
instance) through national health services and/or 
national, social or private health insurance schemes 
operated in line with certain conditions; and

•  guaranteed access to at least essential health care that 
meets the criteria of availability, accessibility, accept-
ability and quality (AAAQ),1 without risk of hard-
ship or increased risk of poverty due to the financial 
consequences of gaining such access. 

World Social Protection Report 2014/155. Towards universal coverage in health 

Box 5.1  Approaching universal coverage in health: Anchored in ILO Conventions and 

Recommendations and further international standards

The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR, 1948) and the International Covenant on Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR, 1966) set out:
•  the right to the “highest attainable standard of physical and mental health” (ICESCR, Art. 12(1)) and to “a 
standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and his family, including … medical 
care” (UDHR, Art. 25(1));

•  the right to “social security, including social insurance” (ICESCR, Art. 9), “in the event of … sickness, 

disability … or other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control” (UDHR, Art. 25(1)); and

•  the right to “conditions which would assure to all medical service and medical attention in the event of 

sickness” (ICESCR, Art. 12(2d)).

The ILO Medical Care Recommendation, 1944 (No. 69), emphasizes that “medical care service should 
cover all members of the community, whether or not they are gainfully occupied” (Para. 8) and provides 
comprehensive guidelines for the provision and delivery of medical care, particularly the essential features 
of a medical care service, the entitlement of persons covered, as well as the scope, organization, quality, 
funding and administration of medical care.

The Social Security (Minimum Standards) Convention, 1952 (No. 102), states that medical care needs to 
be provided “in respect of a condition requiring medical care of a preventive or curative nature” (Art. 7), 
in cases of “morbid condition”, that is, ill health (Art. 8), and in maternity (Art. 8). Medical care benefits 
should include:
•  general practitioner care, including domiciliary visiting;
•  specialist care at hospitals for inpatients and outpatients, and such specialist care as may be available 

outside hospitals;

•  essential pharmaceutical supplies, as prescribed by medical or other qualified practitioners; 
•  hospitalization where necessary; and,
•  pre- and post-natal care for pregnancy and childbirth and their consequences, either by medical practi-

tioners or by qualified midwives, and hospitalization where necessary.

The Medical Care and Sickness Benefits Convention, 1969 (No. 130), and its accompanying Recommen-
dation (No. 134), outline a more advanced set of standards for medical care than Convention No. 102, 
extending the benefit package to include dental care, medical rehabilitation (prosthetics), medical aids such 
as eyeglasses, and services for convalescents. Convention No. 130 also mandates those member States 
that have ratified the Convention to increase the number of persons protected, extend the range of medical 
care provided and extend the duration of sickness benefit.

The Social Protection Floors Recommendation, 2012 (No. 202), stipulates that national social protection 
floors should be established consisting of basic guarantees ensuring at a minimum that, over the life cycle, 
all in need have access to essential health care and to basic income security (Paras 4 and 5), including 
sickness benefits. According to the Recommendation:
•  the principles of universality and entitlement to benefits prescribed by national law should apply (Para. 3);
•  all residents and children should be entitled to “access to a nationally defined set of goods and services, 
constituting essential health care, including maternity care, that meets the criteria of availability, acces-
sibility, acceptability and quality”, without risk of “hardship and an increased risk of poverty due to the 
financial consequences of accessing essential health care” (Paras 5, 6 and 8);

•  social protection floors should be established by member States with a view to “building comprehensive 
social security systems” incorporating “the range and levels of benefits set out in the Social Security 
(Minimum Standards) Convention, 1952 (No. 102), or in other ILO social security Conventions and Rec-
ommendations setting out more advanced standards” (Para. 17).

Universality of health coverage implies that in 
all countries, rights-based approaches, anchored and 
framed in legislation, should exist to cover the whole 
population, including workers in the formal and infor-
mal economy and their families. The implementation 
and enforcement of these approaches is a prerequisite 
for access to health care when needed. 

According to Recommendation No. 202, univer-
sal health coverage further requires effective access to 
at least essential health care as defined at national level 
and also income replacement during periods of sick-
ness, provided equally to all in need. This necessitates 
the availability of acceptable quality care, which entails 
a sufficient number of skilled health workers for service 
delivery and adequate funds e.g. for drugs and infra-
structure. In addition, it is necessary that co-payments, 
user fees and other costs involved in taking up care are 
affordable and that financial protection is provided in 
order to avoid hardship or impoverishment. Finally, 
effective access requires good governance of schemes 
and systems, which should be based on accountability, 
including participatory processes such as social and na-
tional dialogue. 

Thus, the Recommendation defines a concept of 
universal coverage in health that entails taking into ac-
count both legal coverage and access to health care: only 
the combination of both will lead to meaningful pro-
tection for the population and ensure equitable access 
as a matter of right to services that meet the AAAQ 
criteria. The ILO has developed tools and indicators for 
measuring the status quo and progress towards univer-
sal health coverage on both dimensions. 

The notion of universal health coverage was also de-
veloped over the years in other UN agencies, particu-
larly the World Health Organization (WHO), which 
referred to it in, for example, a resolution of the World 
Health Assembly (WHO, 2011b) encouraging coun-
tries to aim for universal coverage. Today, the principle 
of universal health coverage has gained momentum and 
the UN General Assembly has asked the WHO and 
other UN agencies, including the ILO, to give high 
priority to working jointly towards universal health 
coverage in the context of wider approaches to social 
protection, in consultation with UN member States 
(UN, 2012c). 

5.3   Coverage deficits, especially  

in low-income countries 

The ILO’s work towards establishing universal coverage 
in health is supported by specific databases that reveal 
health coverage and access deficits. In line with Rec-
ommendation No. 202, data have been gathered and 
analysed on both key aspects of coverage: legal health 
coverage, defined as affiliation to a health system or 
scheme and access to health care that meets specific cri-
teria which are measured by proxy indicators.2 While 
these data are subject to limitations including reliance 
on published secondary data and gaps in availability, 
the ILO considers the aggregate data to be reliable. 

These data reveal that nearly four-tenths (38.9 per 
cent) of the world’s population are without any form of 
legal health coverage. The largest coverage gaps are in 
Africa, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, where some 
80 per cent of the population is excluded from legal cover-
age, and in Asia: for example, in India, more than 80 per 
cent of the population is not legally covered (figure 5.1).
In 44 countries across the world more than 80 per 
cent of the inhabitants remain without coverage as 
they are not affiliated to any health system or scheme 
(figure 5.2). These countries include Azerbaijan, Ban-
gladesh, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Haiti, Honduras, 
India and Nepal.

Further analyses disclose that the most significant 
gaps in legal health coverage are found in those coun-
tries with the highest poverty levels among the popu-
lation, whereas the highest coverage rates are achieved in 
countries with low poverty levels, such as those of West-
ern Europe (figure 5.3). A close relationship between 
coverage rates and income levels of countries is also ap-
parent: the lower a country’s income, the more likely it is 
to experience coverage gaps in social health protection. 
The global deficit in legal health coverage is com-
pounded by gaps in effective access to health care, as 
revealed by the access deficit indicators chosen to assess 
performance against the AAAQ criteria, namely the 
deficits in the number of health workers needed to de-
liver services, per capita health spending, OOP and as 
indicator for quality and overall health-system outputs 
the maternal mortality rate. Related thresholds used 
to identify the deficits are based on data from coun-
tries that are considered low vulnerability.3 Figure 5.4 
provides a comprehensive overview of the situation at 
the global level, revealing deficits in effective access to 
health care in countries grouped by income level.

The figure shows that across low-income countries: 
•  more than 90 per cent of the population remains 
without any legal health coverage to provide access 
to the most essential health care; 

•  more than 80 per cent of the population lacks access 
to health care due to the absence of health workers 
needed to provide such services;4 

•  with OOP accounting for more than 45 per cent of 
total health expenditure, the affordability of health 
services and financial protection is a grave problem 
and financial hardship as a result of private health 
expenditure is assumed to be very prevalent. 

Significant gaps in the funding of health care are also 
apparent in this group of countries. The threshold re-
quired to provide quality health care is estimated by 
the ILO at US$239 per person per year.5 The current 
financial deficit in low-income countries exceeds 90 per 
cent of necessary expenditure to cover the costs of at 
least essential health care. The global average annual per 
capita spending on health is US$948; the country with

the lowest total spending per year on health, Eritrea, 
spends just US$12 (WHO, 2012). 

The maternal mortality ratio is estimated to be 
as high as 37.5 deaths per 10,000 live births in low-
income countries, and is often directly related to gaps 
in the availability of skilled health workers, particularly 
midwives. 

In addition to these deficits in effective access to 
health care, it should be noted that in most countries 
certain groups, such as the rural population, women, 
the elderly, minorities and people with special needs 
such as those affected by HIV/AIDS, are even more 
likely to face barriers to access than the general popu-
lation (Scheil-Adlung and Kuhl, 2012). 

World Social Protection Report 2014/155. Towards universal coverage in health 

Further, when comparing different groups of coun-
tries, or different schemes within countries, it is im-
portant to be aware that the scope of benefits provided 
by the various systems and schemes may vary signifi-
cantly. Depending on economic, financial, epidemiolog-
ical and social conditions, the scope of benefits might 
range from providing a limited number of public health 
and clinical interventions in primary care facilities to 
comprehensive benefit packages limited only by the ex-
clusion of some services. Thus figure 5.4 does not re-
flect the wide disparities in effective access to care both 
within and across countries.

In countries characterized by significant coverage and 
access deficits, social health protection cannot play the 
roles mentioned above in terms of enhancing product-
ivity, employment, income generation and poverty allevi-
ation. Frequently, workers and their families will not be 
protected during periods of sickness, jobs and incomes 
may be lost due to sickness, and economic downturns 
will not be counterbalanced by the positive productivity 
and employment impacts of social health protection but 
will, on the contrary, be aggravated by its absence.

5.4   Affordability and risk of impoverishment

In nearly all countries throughout the world, OOP 
is involved when seeking health care. Such payments 
of course are frequent where legal health coverage is 

absent, but are also common in countries that have not 
fully implemented and enforced existing legislation or 
have failed to link eligibility and affordability of health 
care when designing health systems and schemes – for 
example, if the scope of the benefits provided is too 
limited or co-payments, user fees and others costs asso-
ciated with taking up health care are high. Where OOP 
is significant, even to the extent of being impoverishing, 
it creates financial barriers preventing access to health 
care when needed. In these cases legal health coverage is 
an illusion, masking a lack of effective access. 

An overview of the extent of legal health coverage, 
and OOP, in selected African countries is presented in 
figure 5.5. It reveals that in some countries with rela-
tively high legal coverage rates, such as Mauritius and 
Egypt, OOP still exceeds 50 per cent of total health 
expenditure.

Often, even the most basic care involves OOP. 
This includes facility-based maternity care in countries 
where most of the population earns less than US$1 a 
day: for example, in Kenya, where nearly 100 per cent of 
women had to pay fees amounting to more than US$18, 
and in Burkina Faso, where 92.5 per cent of women re-
ported paying fees.

Also,  when  evaluating  the  impacts  of  OOP,  it 
should be kept in mind that those living in poverty 
are more often affected by sicknesses incurring higher 
OOP than other groups of the population. This is the 
case for many non-communicable diseases, such as

chronic conditions often prevalent among older per-
sons, and lifestyle-related diseases such as obesity, which 
is often due to the unavailability of healthy food at low 
prices (FAO, 2004) and the difficulty of taking exer-
cise in the absence of public recreational facilities. As 
a result, the poor often suffer from both worse health 
and higher OOP than the rich, a combination that fre-
quently results in increased levels of poverty.

In many countries, women are affected more se-
verely than men by OOP; this applies particularly 
to poor women, whose health-care needs tend to be 
greater than those of men, including those related to 
HIV/AIDS, which is more prevalent among women 
than men (Scheil-Adlung and Kuhl, 2012). 

5.5   Protection from income loss:  
The benefits of paid sick leave 

In addition to protecting against OOP, financial health 
protection involves the provision of sickness benefits 
that aim to replace loss of income and of sick leave 
during periods of ill health. Sickness benefits and sick 
leave are crucial to addressing deteriorating health, 
health-related poverty and loss of productivity. The 
financing mechanisms for paid sick leave are usually 
similar to those for health care, involving some form 
of taxes, including tax subsidies and contributions/pay-
roll taxes and premiums. In a few countries, specific 
employer funds apply. Provisions include both time off 
work and wage replacement during sickness.

While  paid  sick  leave  legislation  exists  for 
formal sector workers in 145 of about 190 countries 

Table 5.1   Global variations in sickness and sick leave benefits

Aspect of benefit

Variations in provision/eligibility

106

globally, the benefits provided differ widely with regard 
to definition of work, wages covered, level of income 
replacement, duration of payments and other specific 
conditions (table 5.1).

Income replacement rates vary between lump sums 
(in 14 per cent of all countries) and 100 per cent of 
wages (in 21 per cent of all countries). More than half of 
countries provide for replacement rates of between 50 
and 75 per cent of wages. The wage replaced also varies, 
and may be limited, for example by a ceiling or the ex-
clusion of supplements. The wage replacement might 
further be subject to means testing and waiting times. 
The period of leave also varies widely: out of a total of 
145 countries reviewed, 102 countries provide for one 
month or more, while seven provide under seven days 
(Scheil-Adlung and Bonnet, 2011).

Where legislation exists, coverage is usually strongly 
skewed to formal sector workers. In most countries, 
workers in the informal economy are totally excluded 
from income replacement during sickness. Even those 
who are covered frequently face barriers to accessing 
paid sick leave, given the fear of losing their jobs, par-
ticularly in times of economic crisis and/or high un-
employment (Scheil-Adlung and Sandner, 2010).

In fact, paid sick leave offers ample returns in the 
form of gains in health and economic productivity 
for employers, workers and the economy at large. Paid 
sick leave allows workers to recuperate rapidly, pre-
vents more serious illness and disability developing, 
and reduces the spreading of diseases to co-workers 
and beyond, whereas working while sick incurs high 
economic costs, due to higher number of people to be 
treated for more severe signs of ill health (Economist

Intelligence Unit, 2014). Also, the lower productivity of 
sick workers has been found to slow down growth and 
development; thus the absence of sick leave creates eco-
nomic costs and avoidable health expenditure (Scheil-
Adlung and Sandner, 2010).

5.6   Financing mechanisms  

for universal coverage in health 

Generally, countries that have achieved high health cov-
erage rates have used revenue-collection and risk-pooling 
mechanisms, mainly taking the form of state-financed 
national health services or contribution-financed na-
tional, social or private health insurance schemes. 

A schematic overview of financing mechanisms cur-
rently in place, showing the various sources and fund-
ing flows used for financing health coverage, is provided 
in figure 5.6. It distinguishes between the use of gov-
ernment revenues to fund national health services, such 
as that in Canada, and other tax-funded programmes, 
e.g. maternity vouchers in Kenya or conditional cash 

transfers in Nicaragua. In other countries, government 
revenues are used to subsidize schemes funded through 
income-related contributions, particularly social health 
insurance schemes where contributions are made by 
both employers and employees (as in Germany and Aus-
tria) and national health insurance schemes where the 
contributions of those without formal employment are 
supported by state subsidies (as in Ghana). 

The  figure  also  includes  private  direct  fund-
ing – OOP – as it is found to various extents in all 
countries, despite the fact that it should not be consid-
ered as a health financing mechanism given its regres-
sive and potentially impoverishing impacts, and the 
absence of burden-sharing it implies. Resort to OOP 
should be restricted to the provision of cost control in-
centives only. 

Countries that have achieved universal coverage in 
health for many decades using tax and contribution-
based financing mechanisms include the United King-
dom, with its National Health Service, and Germany,

Key aspects of performance

National health systems
Pro
•  Risks are pooled for the whole population on a national or sometimes subnational level in fiscally de-

centralized settings

•  Good potential for administrative efficiency and cost control
•  Redistributes between high- and low-risk and high- and low-income groups in the population covered
Con
•  Risks of unstable funding and underfunding due to competing claims on public expenditure
•  Inefficient if no incentives and no effective supervision established
•  Often perceived low quality of services
Social and national health insurance
Pro
•  Generates stable revenues
•  Often strong support from the population given perceived high quality of services
•  Usually involves tax subsidies – particularly in national health insurance schemes – to cover the poor 

and/or other vulnerable groups 

•  Involvement of social partners and voice representation
•  Redistributes between high- and low-risk and high- and low-income groups in the population covered
Con
•  Limited to formal sector workers and their families if no subsidies for informal sector workers and 

other parts of the population are provided

•  Payroll contributions can reduce competitiveness and lead to higher unemployment 
•  Complex to manage; governance and accountability may be problematic 
•  Can lead to cost escalation unless effective contracting mechanisms are in place

Community-based health insurance 
Pro
•  Can reach out to workers in the informal economy and poorer segments of the population
Con
•  Coverage usually only extended to a small percentage of the population 
•  Poor may be excluded unless subsidized
•  May be financially vulnerable if not supported by national subsidies
•  Strong incentive to adverse selection 
•  May be associated with lack of professionalism in governance and administration

Private commercial health insurance
Pro
•  Preferable to out-of-pocket expenditure
•  Increases financial protection and access to health services for those able to pay 
•  Encourages better quality and cost efficiency
Con
•  High administrative costs
•  Ineffective in reducing cost pressures on public health systems
•  Inequitable without subsidized premiums or regulated insurance content and price 
•  Requires administrative and financial infrastructure and capacity
Pro
Potential to cover the whole population
Generate more domestic funds than a single health-financing mechanism
Con
Risk of fragmentation if not well designed and coordinated

of risk-pooling and cross-subsidization. Thus, mixed 
mechanisms require close coordination of all schemes 
and systems in a country with an overall view to achiev-
ing universal coverage. 

Countries that have recently made efforts to reduce 
coverage gaps and fragmentation include Cambodia, 
where some 50 health equity funds now provide access 
to free health-care services to more than half of the 
country’s poor people; Indonesia, where the Govern-
ment committed itself to achieving universal coverage 
by 2019 through a coordinated approach of contrib-
utory and non-contributory schemes; and the Lao 
People’s Democratic Republic, which is currently imple-
menting a national health insurance merging the exist-
ing four fragmented schemes with a view to increasing 
risk-pooling and efficiency. 

Across all regions, 88 countries have currently 
achieved high legal coverage rates of at least 80 per cent 
of the population. Some countries achieved universal 
coverage in a relatively short period (about ten years in 
the case of Thailand) and started reforms at low levels 
of national income and during times of economic crisis 
(Evans et al., 2012). 

As shown in figure 5.7, the majority of countries (45) 
that have achieved high legal coverage rates of 80 per 
cent or more of the population did so using mainly 
state coverage mechanisms, whereas 28 countries used 
mainly insurance mechanisms and the remaining 15 
countries applied both mechanisms in unspecified 
combinations. Analysis of the available information 
by region indicates a preference for state mechanisms 
among countries with high coverage rates in Asia and

financing mechanisms have been implemented suc-
cessfully: for example, in Thailand various systems and 
schemes exist alongside one another, and are well co-
ordinated to avoid fragmentation. 

For other countries, achieving universal coverage 
required that existing gaps be closed by removing bar-
riers within the health-care system and tackling the 
root causes of inequities in access to health care, many 
of which reside outside health systems themselves. Key 
issues to be addressed within the health sector fre-
quently include gaps in legislation and/or implemen-
tation, resulting in fragmentation, inequitable access 
due to deficits in financial protection, affordability 
of services, and absence of paid sick leave; inadequate 
availability of services due to a lack of trained health 
personnel, and related low quality of services; and the 
underfunding of social health protection. Causes that 
lie beyond the health sector often relate to poverty; 
the structure of employment and the labour market 
(e.g. the prominence of the informal economy); ineq-
uities relating to e.g. gender, age, minority status; gaps 
in income support through social protection; and indi-
vidual life circumstances (e.g. migration). If sustainable 
progress is to be made in extending health coverage, 
both types of issue need to be addressed simultaneously, 
with particular attention paid to poverty alleviation 
and labour market policies in order to cut the recipro-
cal relationship of poor health and poverty across the 
social, economic and health sectors. 

There are positive and negative aspects to each of 
the different financing mechanisms outlined here, and 
there is no one model that serves all social and eco-
nomic contexts. Many countries have developed mixed 
mechanisms, either within a single scheme – e.g. state 
subsidization of contributions for the poor in insur-
ance-based schemes, or introduction of insurance fea-
tures in a national health service – or by maintaining 
State and insurance schemes alongside one another. 
The reasons for mixed solutions are often linked to the 
desire to generate sufficient funds from different sources 
and to make best use of the respective advantages of the 
different mechanisms, such as large risk pools, gener-
ation of stable revenues, and reaching out to popula-
tions in remote areas. An overview of observations on 
some key aspects of performance of these coverage and 
financing mechanisms is provided in table 5.2.

When developing mixed mechanisms, it is of par-
ticular importance to avoid a large number of uncoord-
inated schemes and systems using different financing 
mechanisms for various population groups and provid-
ers. Such fragmentation reduces the positive impacts 

the Pacific, whereas in Europe, Africa and the Americas 
there is approximately equal inclination towards state 
and insurance mechanisms. 

These data suggest that, given a strong role and 
commitment on the part of the Government, coun-
tries can achieve high or even universal health cover-
age irrespective of the coverage mechanism(s) chosen 
if the systems and schemes are well designed and the 
pros and cons of different mechanisms are balanced 
with a view to avoiding fragmentation. More important 
than which mechanism is chosen is for the decision to 
be taken on the basis of what is most appropriate to 
the social, economic, historical and cultural context of 
the particular country concerned. Further, it is most 
important that the overall and primary responsibil-
ity for health coverage lies with the State and is based 
on certain key principles, such as solidarity and bur-
den-sharing in financing. Achieving progress in both 
legal health coverage and access to health care requires 
strong government commitment to regulation to maxi-
mize the efficiency and effectiveness of health protec-
tion schemes and systems. Guidance to governments 
in tackling this task is available through various inter-
national legal instruments, ranging from the UDHR to 
ILO Conventions and Recommendations in the area of 
health protection, especially Convention No. 102 and 
Recommendation No. 202 (see box 5.1 above).

5.7   Levels of public and private  

health expenditure 

Globally, public expenditure on health protection as 
a share of GDP more or less equals private health ex-
penditure. A similar picture can be observed at regional 
level, where we find equal public and private shares in 
Asia and the Pacific and in Africa, Latin America and 
the Caribbean, and the Middle East (figure 5.8). Thus 
more than 40 per cent of the global burden of health 
expenditure is borne by private households in the form 
of OOP. This is an alarming statistic, given that OOP 
has the potential to create access barriers, inequities and 
impoverishment, and, being regressive in character and 
lacking any element of risk-pooling, runs counter to the 
key principle of solidarity in financing.

Generally, private OOP is a particularly dominant 
source of health-care funding in the poorest countries 
of the world, despite its regressive impact on income: In 
Africa, private expenditure even exceeds public expend-
iture and amounts to nearly 3 per cent of GDP. 

In fact, there exists a positive correlation between 
poverty rates and shares of OOP in total health expend-
iture: the extent of impoverishing OOP in a country in-
creases with the level of the population living below the 
poverty line. In countries where less than 2 per cent of 
the population are living on US$2 day, about 20 per 
cent of total health expenditure derives from OOP; in 
countries where more than 50 per cent of the popu-
lation are living on US$2 a day, it amounts to around

50 per cent. Thus it is the poorest, who are also the most 
in need, who suffer most from OOP and related inequi-
ties (figure 5.9).

5.8   The global shortage of health workers 

The low level of public health financing is also reflected 
in the low number of health workers. Skilled health 
workers are the backbone of any health system (Global 
Health Workforce Alliance and WHO, 2014): indeed, 
professional health staff – physicians, nurses and mid-
wifery personnel as defined by the WHO – are a pre-
requisite for the delivery of quality care services to those 
in need. However, the health workforce is experiencing 
a global crisis: it is much too small in numbers to deliver 
the services needed, unequally distributed and often 
lacking decent working conditions. According to the 
latest available data, in numerous countries – including, 
for example, Haiti, Niger, Senegal and Sierra Leone – as 
many as 10,000 people have to rely on services provided 
by five or fewer health workers. By contrast, in a high-
income country such as Finland there are 269 health 
workers for 10,000 people (table 5.3).

As a result, in many countries health workers are 
stretched to their limits and seek jobs elsewhere; this

in turn often further reduces the availability of health 
services, especially in rural areas, and contributes to 
a “brain drain” of skills and experience. At the global 
level, health-worker migration from poorer to richer 
countries is constantly increasing: for example, between 
2007 and 2012 more than 230,000 migrant health 
workers took up job opportunities in health-care ser-
vices in the United States (OECD, 2013c). 

At the same time, pay cuts for civil servants, includ-
ing health workers, are under consideration in many 
countries, both at lower-middle-income level (for exam-
ple, Mongolia) and also at higher-income level, mainly 
to achieve cost savings (Ortiz and Cummins, 2013). 

Only a few countries have indicated that they plan 
to increase the number of their health workers, ensure 
training of existing health workers or improve the im-
portant coordination between education, the labour 
market and the health sector. However, according to a 
recent review of IMF country reports, general increases 
in the number of civil servants including health workers 
are under consideration in some countries, including 
the Central African Republic, Gambia and Mozam-
bique (Ortiz and Cummins, 2013). Timor-Leste aims 
to increase its number of medical staff by retaining 
trained doctors from Cuba (Asante et al., 2014). 

The ILO estimates that 41.1 health workers per 
10,000 population are necessary to provide at least essen-
tial services to all in need.6 This target is met or exceeded 

6  This figure is based on calculations of median value of the density of health workers in countries where socio-economic conditions 
and health financing characteristics are conducive to universal coverage. Statistical details of the ILO Access Deficit Indicator and the 
assessment of deficits are presented in Annex IV, table B.11.

not only by high-income countries but also by some low- 
and lower-middle-income countries, including Armenia, 
Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia and Swaziland. However, across 
the globe 10.3 million additional health workers are re-
quired to close the current gaps and ensure the delivery 
of health services to all in need. The majority of these are 
needed in developing countries, mainly in Asia (7.1 mil-
lion) and Africa (2.8 million) (figure 5.10). 

Investment in the development of the health work-
force is an essential condition of progress towards uni-
versal health coverage and addressing the global health 
access deficit. Such investment is now timely, given 

that the share of total health expenditure devoted to 
remuneration of the health workforce has fallen over 
the past ten years while other elements of health ex-
penditure have increased significantly (Hernandez-
Pena et al., 2013). Furthermore, and most importantly, 
such investment has the potential to boost the global 
economy, promote equitable economic recovery at na-
tional level and generate much-needed decent work at 
fair incomes.

5.9   Inadequate levels of pay  

for health workers 

In the quest for progress in health coverage, the increase 
in numbers of health workers must go hand in hand 
with the creation of decent working conditions, includ-
ing adequate wages. 

In recent years, the wage bills of health workers 
have fallen, sometimes dramatically: in the Democratic 
Republic of Congo and Myanmar, for example, they 
declined by about 40 per cent during economic crises 
between 2007 and 2009 (UNICEF, 2010). In fact, the 
wages are often so poor that the workers in the lowest-
paid categories are faced with the risk of impoverish-
ment: In countries such as Sudan, Egypt and Myanmar, 
health-sector wages are only 1 per cent above the pov-
erty line of US$2 a day.7 In other countries, while the 
wage bills of health workers were stable in nominal 
terms, they declined in real terms as a result of falling 
purchasing power.

113

Over the first decade of this century, the remunera-
tion of salaried health workers as a proportion of GDP 
remained nearly unchanged globally and decreased in 
terms of total health expenditure (figure 5.11). In add-
ition, delays in payment are frequent in many countries. 
The consequences include absenteeism, requests for in-
formal payments and a brain drain of workers seeking 
better wages outside their home countries. 

5.10   Fiscal consolidation measures:  

Drivers of economic recovery  
or part of the problem? 

During the recent crisis, only a few countries managed 
to increase legal health coverage. Universal health in-
surance schemes were introduced in Benin and Gabon 
(ISSA, 2013b); legal coverage was expanded in the 
United States (for young people and those with pre-ex-
isting conditions) under the 2010 Affordable Care and 
Patient Protection Act, in the Philippines under the 
Aquino Health Agenda for Achieving Universal Cov-
erage in 2010, and in China for both urban and rural 
residents (SSA and ISSA, 2012; SSA and ISSA, 2013a). 
Other countries, such as Uruguay, aimed at both ex-
panding coverage and also reducing fragmentation and 
segmentation (EsSalud and ILO, 2013).

At the same time, many countries implemented 
fiscal consolidation measures,8 with the aim of achiev-
ing economic recovery primarily through the reduction 
of fiscal deficits. Among these measures were structural 
reforms and quantitative adjustments in the public 
sector. In the health sector, these frequently take the 
form of budget cuts with negative effects on the avail-
ability and affordability of health services and of es-
sential drugs such as antibiotics, and the creation and 
maintenance of infrastructure. Thus per capita health 
spending fell significantly between 2009 and 2011 in 
11 OECD countries, notably in Greece and Ireland 
(11.1 and 6.6 per cent respectively) (OECD, 2013c). 

Table 5.4 provides an overview of some recent an-
nouncements of fiscal consolidation policies in the area 
of health protection, along with the actual or projected 
fiscal savings arising.

These announcements reveal both general budget 
cuts for government health ministries and severe cut-
backs in public health expenditure on a per capita basis. 

Such cuts have resulted in reduced supply of health care 
in a range of areas, from preventive care to non-emer-
gency care for undocumented migrants in Spain. Re-
ductions in public expenditure also affected the wages 
of the health workforce (table 5.5); caused the post-
ponement of important reforms improving and ex-
tending legal health coverage, e.g. the national health 
insurance system in Cyprus; imposed volume limits on 
some services; and led to reduced benefits and the re-
moval of preventive care. Meanwhile, OOP increased 
markedly in several countries, while public health ex-
penditure contracted or remained more or less constant 
(table 5.6). 

The shift of the burden for paying health care from 
the public purse to individuals and households is having 
a particularly severe effect on lower income groups, 
given the regressive impact of OOP. As a result, gaps in 
coverage and access between rich and poor are widen-
ing. Thus fiscal consolidation policies combined with 
growing poverty due to the recession are likely to in-
crease inequities within countries. 

In addition, job and wage cuts for health workers 
significantly reduced access to health services. Table 5.5 
outlines the most recently announced cuts in wages 
of public sector workers, including health workers, in 
European countries that were particularly badly hit by 
the financial crises: in Greece, cuts have reduced public 
wages since 2010 by some 30 percentage points, while 
in Portugal and Spain reductions of 5 percentage points 
have occurred.

At just the same time as fiscal consolidation meas-
ures were resulting in reductions in the numbers and 
wages of health workers, an increased demand for 
public health services was apparent in countries such 
as Greece and Cyprus. Even though public hospital 
admissions were rising and private hospital admissions 
falling (Kentikelenis et al., 2011), the Government of 
Cyprus decided to postpone the implementation of 
the planned national health insurance scheme (WHO, 
2012), which led to further inequities and gaps in 
access.

Overall, the impact of fiscal consolidation measures 
taken in response to the crisis has been to stall or even 
reverse progress towards universal health coverage by 
sharpening inequities in access to health care, increas-
ing the financial burden on private households, redu-
cing benefits and thus increasing exclusion. 

8  In this report, fiscal consolidation refers to the wide array of adjustment measures adopted to reduce government deficits and debt 
accumulation. Fiscal consolidation policies are often referred to as austerity policies.

As for their impact on the economy, it can be con-
cluded that, rather than curing the symptoms of debts 
and deficits, fiscal consolidation measures in the area of 
health protection have acted as barriers to economic re-
covery and worsened the effects of the economic crisis 
by weakening the productivity of the workforce and re-
ducing employment of much-needed health workers. In 
addition, these measures have had a negative impact on 
the right to work and on adequate standards of living, 
particularly those of the most vulnerable segments of 
the population that have been hit hardest by budget 
cuts and increased OOP. 

5.11   Addressing the challenges:  

Achieving sustainable progress  
in access to health care

The recent economic and financial crisis strained house-
holds’ and governments’ budgets in many countries. It 
led to preventable negative impacts on health through 
the reduced availability and affordability of quality 
health care, and contributed to increased inequities in 
access to health care. Furthermore, the economic recov-
ery was hampered by the fiscal consolidation measures 

taken to address it. There is now an urgent need to act 
in pursuit of sustainable progress. 

Scaling up global and national health coverage rates 
and providing access to necessary health benefits, par-
ticularly in low- and middle-income countries, will end 
the downward spiral of ill health and poverty and con-
tribute to economic recovery. However, to achieve sus-
tainable progress it will be necessary to rethink policies 
and consider lessons learnt.

In recent decades, the importance of health coverage 
to the economy has often been insufficiently taken into 
account by policy-makers, who accepted the existence 
of huge access deficits that in some countries have left 
up to 80 per cent of the population – often those most 
in need – without any legal health coverage. In add-
ition, the erroneously assumed trade-off between costs 
of universal coverage in health and economic growth 
led to potential gains in productivity, employment and 
development more generally being overlooked. As a 
result, ill health was frequently understood as a private 
matter, ignoring the complex social and economic re-
lationships that link poverty, employment, gender and 
socio-economic stratification in excluding people from 
effective access to health care.

A contemporary concept of providing access to 
health care through social protection places health 
within a framework based on human rights. ILO Rec-
ommendation No. 202 connects the right to health 
with the underlying social and economic determinants 
and addresses these links at the systemic level, both 
within and beyond the health sector, rather than point-
ing to the individual level and advising short-term 
 remedies without seeing the big picture. 

Such  an  approach  aims  at  sustainable  progress 
through investments in social health protection struc-
tures and institutions, backed up by political commit-
ment and technical knowledge. It requires an explicit 
acknowledgement of the need for both legal health cov-
erage and accessibility of at least essential health care 
that is available, of acceptable quality, and affordable 
without financial hardship. Such provision contributes 
to equity, reducing exclusion as well as poverty. Fur-
ther, a contemporary concept of universal health cov-
erage involves fair financing based on burden-sharing, 
using taxes (e.g. for national health services), contribu-
tions/payroll taxes and/or premium-based financing 
(for various forms of social, national or private insur-
ances). OOP does not feature as a means of health fi-
nancing but may be used in a minimal capacity for 
other purposes, such as incentives. The obligation to 
meet the core content of the right to health through

ILO Recommendation No. 202 offers guidance on 
related policies that are necessary to fully realize the 
positive impacts and sustainability of investments in 
health and achieve universal health coverage (table 5.7). 
According to this Recommendation, access to needed 
health care should be enshrined in legislation that pro-
tects the affordability of services and ensures access to 
care in terms of the availability of services and facilities 
that are of adequate quality and delivered by skilled 
staff. The aim should be universal coverage based on 
the provision of, at a minimum, essential health care 
benefits. Such benefits are to be defined at national level 
with a view to meeting vital medical needs and demand 
for maternal and preventive care, and providing finan-
cial protection. The progressive development of essen-
tial health care towards more comprehensive benefit 
packages is recommended. 

The availability of quality services necessitates that 
a sufficient number of health workers be trained, re-
cruited, provided with decent working conditions and 
distributed in an equitable way within countries, par-
ticularly in rural and urban slum areas. In this con-
text, it is essential that governments balance supply and 
demand within national labour markets through im-
proved working conditions, including wages. Further, 
it is important to address wage disparities across re-
gions, and between general practitioners and specialists. 

Improving working conditions and wages for health-
care workers is crucial for overcoming the lack of 
labour supply in all branches of the sector. This requires 
the right to organize and bargain for all health-care 
workers. Collective bargaining is the best way to nego-
tiate workplace arrangements that attract the necessary 
number and quality of health-care workers. Further, 
public authorities need to be exemplary employers and 
procurers. Thus, expenditure of public funds and any 
contract for health-care provision must include clauses 
ensuring decent wages.9 Key instruments to achieve 
the necessary conditions include laws and regulations, 
collective agreements and other mechanisms for negoti-
ation between employers’ and workers’ representatives, 
and arbitration awards. Finally, as regards migration of 
health workers, bilateral and multilateral arrangements 
are needed with a view to compensate for training costs 
and avoiding brain drain. 

Generating sufficient funds for universal health pro-
tection involves exploring the pros and cons of all exist-
ing financing mechanisms and efficiently coordinating 
various approaches in a way that is perceived as fair, 
avoids fragmentation and tax evasion, and combats cor-
ruption. Most important for allocating sufficient funds 
is political will, as shown most recently in Thailand, 
where universal health coverage was achieved within a 
decade and reform efforts started in conditions of rela-
tively low per capita income and a large informal econ-
omy (Evans et al., 2012). Further, fiscal policies should

World Social Protection Report 2014/155. Towards universal coverage in health 

be systematically used with a view to closing funding 
gaps and addressing the reciprocal relationship between 
ill health and poverty through various social protec-
tion measures. In this context, returns on investments 
in health in terms of productivity, employment and de-
velopment should be taken into account when assessing 
the cost of extending social health protection. 

Many of the problems outlined in this chapter may 
be diagnosed as resulting at least in part from ineffi-
cient and ineffective governance and administration 
of national systems of health protection. This raises 
broad issues such as the absence of political and in-
stitutional commitment as well as the importance of 
regular monitoring, feedback and support through tripar-
tite national and social dialogue. Monitoring advances 
in equitable access against thresholds is a prerequisite 
of sustainable progress. Thresholds should be set with 
a view to measuring both affordability and availability 
of quality care and financial protection for all in need, 
and should include universal population coverage in 
terms of legislation, limitations on OOP to rule out 
impoverishment or rise above 40 per cent of house-
hold income (net of subsistence), and a threshold of 
41.1 health workers, enjoying decent working condi-
tions, per 10,000 population. 

Further,  social  dialogue,  fundamentally  on  a 
tripartite  basis,  is  essential  in  addressing  ineffi-
ciencies – whether they are of an administrative or man-
agerial nature within a scheme or system, or result from 
incoherent policies at the national, regional or commu-
nity level. The need for social dialogue has been rein-
forced in Recommendation No. 202, which mandates 
“tripartite participation with representative organiza-
tions of employers and workers, as well as consultation 
with other relevant and representative organizations of 
persons concerned” (Para. 3(r)). In facilitating progress 
in health protection it is of paramount importance 
to establish regular tripartite social dialogue between 
relevant stakeholders under the leadership of national 

governing bodies, and to ensure proper governance and 
administration of health systems and policies.

In addressing equally the needs for essential health 
care and income support, the policies suggested in 
table 5.7 provide ample scope for tackling the root 
causes of inequities in access to health care and con-
tributing to universal coverage of social protection in 
health. When implementing coherent policies across 
the social, economic and health sectors, governments 
should emphasize poverty alleviation and labour market 
policies in order to avoid unintended increases in in-
equality and to realize the economic spillover effects. 

These policies have the potential to achieve both 
universal health coverage and economic returns – in 
all countries, and at all levels of national income. They 
entail:
•  a political vision of universality based on an inclu-
sive framework that is supported by a committed 
government, social partners and civil society and in-
corporates an evidence-based system and/or scheme 
design applying technical expertise and global best 
practices;

•  objectives that match expectations of the population 
in terms of availability, affordability and quality of 
services;

• 

•  realizing the potential of social protection floor pol-
icies, created, implemented and monitored on the 
basis of solid assessment and impact analyses, to 
create fiscal space and generate domestic funds for 
health protection; 
institutions characterized by good governance that 
have the capacity and means to implement necessary 
reforms based on efficient and effective strategies 
aimed at coordinating existing schemes and systems, 
addressing gaps in the health workforce and striving 
to ensure that people receive the care they expect 
wherever they live.

Expanding social protection
Key to crisis recovery, inclusive  
development and social justice

119119

KEY MESSAGES 
 n The global financial and economic crisis has forcefully underlined the im-
portance of social security as a human right, and as an economic and social 
necessity, as set out in the ILO Social Protection Floors Recommendation 
(2012), No. 202.

 n In the first phase of the crisis (2008–09), social protection played a strong role 
in the expansionary response. About 50 high- and middle-income countries 
announced fiscal stimulus packages totalling US$2.4 trillion, of which approxi-
mately a quarter was invested in counter-cyclical social protection measures. 
 n In the second phase of the crisis (2010 onwards), many governments embarked 
on fiscal consolidation and premature contraction of expenditure, despite an 
urgent need of public support among vulnerable populations. In 2014, the 
scope of public expenditure adjustment is expected to intensify significantly; 
according to IMF projections, 122 countries will be contracting expenditures in 
terms of GDP, of which 82 are developing countries. Further, a fifth of countries 
are undergoing fiscal consolidation, defined as cutting public expenditures 
below pre-crisis levels.

 n Contrary to public perception, fiscal consolidation measures are not limited 
to Europe; many developing countries have adopted adjustment measures, 
including the elimination or reduction of food and fuel subsidies; cuts or caps 
on wages, including for health and social care workers; more narrow targeting 
of social protection benefits; and reforms of pension and health care systems. 
Many governments are also considering revenue-side measures, for example 
increasing consumption taxes such as value added tax (VAT) on basic products 
that are consumed by poor households. 

 n In developing countries, some of the proceeds of these adjustments, e.g. from 
the elimination of subsidies, have been used to design narrowly targeted safety 
nets, as a compensatory mechanism to the poorest. However, given the large 
number of vulnerable low-income households in developing countries, more 
efforts are necessary to meet the social protection needs of the population.

 n Of particular significance are the divergent trends in richer and poorer coun-
tries: while many high-income countries are contracting their social security 
systems, many developing countries are expanding them. 
"

 n High-income countries have reduced a range of social protection benefits and 
limited access to quality public services. Together with persistent unemployment, 
lower wages and higher taxes, these measures have contributed to increases in 
poverty or social exclusion, now affecting 123 million people in the European 
Union, 24 per cent of the population, many of them children, women and per-
sons with disabilities. Future old-age pensioners will receive lower pensions in at 
least 14 European countries. Several European courts have found cuts unconsti-
tutional. The cost of adjustment has been passed on to populations, who have 
been coping with fewer jobs and lower income for more than five years. Depressed 
household income levels are leading to lower domestic consumption and lower 
demand, slowing down recovery. The achievements of the European social model, 
which dramatically reduced poverty and promoted prosperity and social cohesion 
in the period following the Second World War, have been eroded by short-term 
adjustment reforms. 

 n Most middle-income countries are boldly expanding their social protection sys-
tems, thereby contributing to their domestic demand-led growth strategies: this 
presents a powerful development lesson. China, for instance, has achieved nearly 
universal coverage of pensions and increased wages; Brazil accelerated the expan-
sion of social protection coverage and minimum wages since 2009. Continued 
commitment is necessary to address persistent inequalities. 

 n Some lower-income countries have extended social protection mainly through 
narrowly targeted temporary safety nets with very low benefit levels. However, in 
many of these countries debates are under way on building social protection floors 
as part of comprehensive social protection systems. There are options available 
to governments to expand fiscal space for social protection even in the poorest 
countries.

 n The case for social protection is compelling in our times. Social protection is both 
a human right and sound economic policy. Social protection powerfully contributes 
to reducing poverty, exclusion, and inequality – while enhancing political stability 
and social cohesion. Social protection also contributes to economic growth by 
supporting household income and thus domestic consumption; this is particularly 
important during this time of slow recovery and low global demand. Further, social 
protection enhances human capital and productivity, so it has become a critical 
policy for transformative national development. Social protection and specifically 
social protection floors are essential for recovery, inclusive development and social 
justice, and must be part of the post-2015 development agenda.

120

Social protection systems have undergone profound 

changes in recent years. While many emerging 
economies have taken bold measures to expand social 
protection to promote economic and social develop-
ment, other parts of the world, including many high-
income countries, have been grappling with fiscal 
consolidation1 and adjusting their social protection sys-
tems to make for cost savings. These divergent policy 
trends and their implications are the focus of this chap-
ter. In particular, the chapter identifies the rationale 

and impact of, respectively, fiscal consolidation meas-
ures and expansionary policies on recovery efforts in 
high-, middle- and low-income countries. The chapter 
concludes by setting out the positive developmental im-
pacts of social protection in the drive to promote sus-
tainable and inclusive growth, to build human capital, 
and to achieve political stability, together constituting 
a set of powerful reasons why social protection must be 
part of the post-2015 development agenda. 

1  In this report, “fiscal consolidation” refers to the wide array of adjustment measures adopted to reduce government deficits and 
accumulated debt. Fiscal consolidation policies are often referred to as austerity policies.

6.1   Grappling with recession and slow growth: 

Social protection and the global crisis

6.1.1   Social protection in the first phase  

of the global crisis: Expansion  
and fiscal stimulus (2008–09) 

As the crisis bit in 2008–09, the vast majority of gov-
ernments in countries immediately affected scaled up 
public social expenditure in order to sustain growth and 
protect their populations from the adverse effects of the 
food, fuel and financial shocks. A total of 145 countries 
ramped up public expenditure during this first phase of 
the crisis. At least 48 countries announced fiscal stim-
ulus packages totalling US$2.4 trillion, of which ap-
proximately a quarter was invested in social protection 
measures (figure 6.1). An ILO survey of fiscal stimulus 
plans in 54 developing and developed countries (ILO, 
2009b) indicated that 54 per cent of governments 
boosted cash transfers, 44 per cent supported old-age 
pensions and 37 per cent increased access to health 
benefits. Additionally, 16 per cent of governments in-
troduced food subsidies.

Social protection played a key role in attenuating 
the immediate negative effects of the crisis on house-
holds in this first phase. One of the key lessons from 
these initial crisis responses is that social protection can 
function as an automatic stabilizer most effectively if 

the relevant schemes and programmes are implemented 
before crisis conditions take hold (ILO, 2010c; ILO and 
World Bank, 2012; Bonnet, Saget and Weber, 2012; 
Behrendt et al., 2011). In the absence of such social pro-
tection measures, the effect of the crisis on unemploy-
ment, households’ disposable income and poverty rates 
in 2009–10 would have been much higher (ILO, 2011a).

6.1.2   Social protection in the second phase 

of the global crisis: Fiscal consolidation 
(2010 and after)

These Keynesian counter-cyclical measures were short-
lived. As the crisis moved into a second phase from 2010 
onwards, rising concerns over sovereign debt levels and 
fiscal deficits led governments to abandon fiscal stimuli 
and introduce fiscal consolidation measures. According 
to the IMF’s projections of government expenditure in 
the World Economic Outlook database (October 2013), 
106 of the 181 countries for which data were available 
moved to contract public spending in 2010. 

In 2014, the scope of public expenditure contrac-
tion is expected to intensify significantly, with impacts 
in 122 countries, and then steadily increase to affect 
125 countries in 2015. The latest IMF forecast suggests 
that governments will continue on this contractionary 
trend at least through 2016 (figure 6.2, panel (a)).2 It is

2  IMF expenditure projections change significantly; this section is an update of earlier work (Ortiz and Cummins, 2012; Ortiz and 
Cummins, 2013) in which the authors applied the same methodology to understand the scope of austerity, using the same data source –  
the expenditure projections contained in the IMF’s World Economic Outlook, updated every six months. Any divergence in results is due to 
changes in IMF forecasts.

important to note that this trend is observed across 
countries with different levels of income. Specifically, 
during 2010 public expenditure contraction affected 13 
low-income, 28 lower-middle-income, 33 upper-middle-
income and 32 high-income countries. In 2014, accord-
ing to IMF fiscal projections, as many as 82 developing 
and 40 high-income countries are expected to contract 
public expenditures.3

In terms of real spending growth, a more conserva-
tive measure, IMF fiscal data reveal a peak contraction 
in 2011, with more than 60 countries contracting, but 
thereafter an easing from 2012 onwards (figure 6.2, 
panel (b)). Again, the incidence is larger in developing 
countries than in high-income economies. 

Compared with the pre-crisis period, an alarming 
number of countries in 2013–15 appear to be under-
going excessive fiscal contraction, defined as cutting 
public expenditures below pre-crisis levels.4 In terms of 
GDP, analysis of expenditure projections reveals that in 
37 countries (one-fifth of the total), governments may 
be cutting their budgets excessively during 2013–15 
(figure 6.3, panel (a)). These include countries with sig-
nificant development challenges, such as Eritrea, Sudan, 
Iraq, Guinea-Bissau, Yemen, Sri Lanka, Ethiopia, Mada-
gascar, Jamaica, Kazakhstan, Botswana, Cabo Verde, 
Turkmenistan, Burundi, Lebanon and the Philippines, 
among others. Nearly half (18) of these countries are 
expected to reduce spending by more than 3.0 per cent 

of GDP, on average, during this latest phase of the crisis 
when compared to expenditure levels during the pre-
crisis period. In real terms, 17 governments are forecast 
to have fiscal envelopes in 2013–15 that are smaller, on 
average, than those of 2005–07 (figure 6.3, panel (b)). 
This is a dramatic situation, especially for developing 
countries where social spending is already very limited 
to start with.

How have governments been adjusting public ex-
penditures since 2010? A review of 314 IMF country 
reports in 174 countries published between January 
2010 and February 2013 (Ortiz and Cummins, 2013) 
indicates that governments are considering a combin-
ation of six main policy options (table 6.1), which relate 
strongly to the social protection of populations (see also 
box 6.1): phasing out or eliminating subsidies; cutting 
or capping wage bills; increasing taxes on consump-
tion; undertaking pension reforms aimed at reducing 
the costs of pension systems; rationalizing and more 
narrowly targeting social assistance and other social 
protection benefits; and introducing reforms to health-
care systems aimed at cost containment. These fiscal 
consolidation strategies are not limited to Europe, and, 
in fact, are prevalent in developing countries. Many 
governments are also considering revenue-side meas-
ures  that  can  have  adverse  impacts  on  vulnerable 
populations, mainly the introduction or extension of 
consumption taxes such as VAT, on basic products that

4  For the purposes of this report, excessive fiscal contraction is defined as reducing government expenditure below pre-crisis levels (average 
spending values during 2005–07). The analysis does not make a judgement about the adequacy or not of pre-crisis spending levels, it merely 
uses expenditures in 2005–07 to establish a baseline.

Box 6.1  From fiscal stimulus to fiscal 

consolidation – Implications for social protection
In  2008–09  there  was  a  global  counter-cyclical 
policy consensus, whereby countries coordinated 
policies to combat the negative social and economic 
impacts of the crisis with the aim of maintaining de-
mand and growth. The IMF spelled out the need for 
global fiscal stimulus: “In normal times, the Fund 
would indeed be recommending to many countries 
that they reduce their budget deficit and their public 
debt. But these are not normal times … if no fiscal 
stimulus is implemented, then demand may con-
tinue to fall … what is needed is … a commitment 
by governments that they will follow whatever pol-
icies it takes to avoid a repeat of a Great Depression 
scenario” (Blanchard, 2008). 

Early  in  2010,  IMF  advice  underwent  a  major 
change (later to be supported by the OECD), and ul-
timately also by the G20. Two IMF Board papers ap-
proved in February 2010 – Exiting from crisis interven-
tion policies and Strategies for fiscal consolidation in 
the post-crisis world – called for large-scale fiscal ad-
justment “when the recovery is securely underway” 
and for structural reforms in public finance to be 
initiated immediately “even in countries where the 
recovery is not yet securely underway” (IMF, 2010a; 
IMF, 2010b). Reforms of pension and health entitle-
ments were called for, accompanied by strengthened 
“safety nets” for the poorest (IMF, 2010a, pp. 15–
32). On the composition of fiscal adjustment, it was 
advised that most of it could come from: 
1.  unwinding the previously adopted fiscal stimulus 

packages;

2.  reforming  pension  and  health  entitlements  to 
reduce the long-term financial obligations of the 
state by way of avoiding “a rise in spending as a 
share of GDP” (IMF, 2010a, p. 16);

3.  containing other spending, by means such as 

eliminating subsidies; 

4.  increasing tax revenues. 

All these suggested reforms became mainstream 
policy advice in a majority of countries around the 
world after 2010 and shaped the direction embraced 
by the economic adjustment programmes agreed 
with countries facing a sovereign debt crisis. The 
OECD 2010 Economic Outlook (OECD, 2010d) also 
focused on the urgent need for fiscal consolidation 
and structural reforms (in, for example, labour and 
product markets), pointing out that in both OECD and 
non-OECD countries the economic slack was dis-
appearing rapidly. While these documents generally 
focused on higher-income countries, they also urged 
fiscal adjustment in developing countries, given that 
the risk of debt distress was increasing there too. 
These documents thus represented the first signs of 
a worldwide policy reversal. However, it turned out 
that economic slack did not disappear and instead 
a slow growth pattern risks becoming entrenched, 
partly due to fiscal consolidation itself.

are disproportionately consumed by poor households. 
All of the different adjustment approaches pose poten-
tially serious consequences for vulnerable populations, 
as summarized below.

Eliminating or reducing subsidies

Overall,  100  governments  in  78  developing  and 
22 high-income countries appear to be reducing or re-
moving subsidies, predominately on fuel, but also on 
electricity, food and agriculture. While energy subsi-
dies are being scaled back across all regions, this policy 
choice appears to be especially dominant in the Middle 
East and North Africa, South Asia and sub-Saharan 
Africa. The removal of public support for food and agri-
culture is also most frequently observed in the Middle 
East and North Africa, and in sub-Saharan Africa. 
These adjustment measures are being implemented at 
a time when food and energy prices are hovering near 
record highs; if basic subsidies are withdrawn without 
compensation being provided through adequate social 
protection mechanisms, food and energy may become 
unaffordable for many households, in particular, but 
not only, the poorest ones. The lack of proper compen-
sation has led to a significant number of public demon-
strations, reported in 60 countries (Ortiz et al., 2013; 
Zaid et al., 2014).

Wage bill cuts/caps

As recurrent expenditures such as the salaries of civil 
servants (particularly of social sector workers) tend to 

be the largest component of national budgets, an esti-
mated 98 governments in 75 developing and 23 high-
income countries have considered reducing their public 
wage bills, often as a part of civil service reforms. This 
policy stance may translate into salaries being reduced 
or eroded in real value, payments being made in arrears, 
hiring freezes and/or employment retrenchment, all of 
which have adverse impacts on the delivery of public 
services to the population. Health authorities have 
warned of the health hazards caused by such fiscal con-
solidation in Europe and other regions. 

Increasing consumption taxes  
on goods and services

Some 94 governments in 63 developing and 31 high-
income countries have been considering options to 
boost revenue by raising rates of VAT or sales tax, or 
removing exemptions. The consequent increases in the 
costs of basic goods and services are usually regressive, 
as they tend to affect more significantly the costs of 
living of lower-income households, including those al-
ready in poverty, unless compensatory measures are in 
place, for example through the provision of cash and 
near-cash (e.g. food stamps) benefits, or the distribu-
tion of basic goods and services at subsidized prices to 
lower income groups. Some other countries are consid-
ering alternative tax approaches, involving for example 
the expansion of usually more progressive taxes, such 
as those on income, inheritance, property and corpor-
ations, including taxes on the financial sector.

Reforming pension and health systems

Approximately 86 governments in 47 developing and 
39 high-income countries have been considering a var-
iety of changes to their contributory pension systems, 
by means such as making eligibility conditions stricter 
or raising the statutory pensionable age, so that people 
have to work longer to receive a full benefit, lowering 
benefit replacement rates, or eliminating minimum 
pension guarantees for less fortunate workers. An-
other 37 countries are also discussing reforming their 
health-care systems with a focus on cost containment, 
generally by increasing fees and co-payments made 
by patients along with cost-saving measures in public 
health centres. These adjustment measures have imme-
diate negative effects on the poor, increase poverty risks 
for others, and may lead to the effective exclusion of 
many from the receipt of benefits or critical assistance 
at a time when their incomes are decreasing and their 
social needs are greatest.

Rationalizing and more narrowly targeting social 
assistance and other social protection benefits

Overall, 80 governments in 55 developing and 25 high-
income countries have been considering rationalizing 
their social spending, often by revising eligibility cri-
teria and targeting benefits more narrowly on the very 
poorest, which implies a de facto reduction of social 
protection coverage and a more limited role for social 
protection  systems  in  preventing  poverty.  A  more 
narrow targeting on the poorest has been discussed 
by governments in 25 high-income and 55 developing 
countries, including low-income countries such as the 
Gambia, Haiti, Mali, Mauritania, Nicaragua, Sene-
gal, Sudan, Timor-Leste, Togo and Zambia, where on 
average about half of the population is below the na-
tional poverty line. In such places, the rationale for tar-
geting assistance on the poorest of the poor is weak. This 
policy approach runs a high risk of excluding large seg-
ments of vulnerable populations at a time of economic 
crisis and hardship. Rather than targeting and scaling 
down social protection programmes to achieve cost sav-
ings over the short term, there is a strong case for scal-
ing them up in times of crisis and building rights-based 
social protection floors.

Contrary to public perception, fiscal consolida-
tion measures are not limited to Europe; in fact, most 
of the adjustment measures summarized here feature 
most prominently in developing countries, particu-
larly subsidy reduction, wage bill cuts/caps, and more 
and more “rationalization” of existing social protec-
tion programmes. The main risk of these expenditure-
contracting measures is that, when taken without due 
recognition of their negative consequences, they result 
in often large vulnerable groups being excluded from 
receiving benefits or critical assistance. 

Ill-designed fiscal consolidation measures threaten 
not only the human right to social security, but also the 
rights to food, health, education, and other essential 
goods and services (Sepúlveda, 2012; UN, 2012b). In 
many contexts, fiscal consolidation policies are driven 
by a cost-saving logic, and their negative social impacts 
on women, children, older persons, the unemployed, 
immigrants or persons with disabilities, are viewed as 
unavoidable collateral damage in the quest for fiscal bal-
ances and debt service (CESR, 2012). The UN High 
Commissioner for Human Rights has warned that “aus-
terity measures endanger social protection schemes, in-
cluding pensions, thereby dramatically affecting the 
enjoyment of the rights to social security and to an ad-
equate standard of living” (OHCHR, 2013, para. 36), 
particularly for vulnerable and marginalized groups, 
pointing to States’ positive obligation to ensure adequate 
financial regulation, as necessary to safeguard human 
rights, as well as the obligation to ensure the satisfaction, 
at the very least, of minimum essential levels of all eco-
nomic, social and cultural rights, including the right to 
social security (OHCHR, 2013, esp. paras 36–71). 

6.1.3   Divergent trends across countries 

Generally, the latest available complete data (2011) 
show a worldwide decline in social protection expendi-
ture in terms of GDP, particularly for middle-income 
and high-income countries (figure 6.4).5 Only low-
income countries have increased public social protec-
tion expenditure as a percentage of GDP. The level of 
social expenditure has not risen sufficiently to keep up 
with the increases in unemployment and poverty.

The four panels of figure 6.4 show trends in per 
capita real government social protection expenditure in 

5  At the time of writing of this report, comparable worldwide data on social security expenditure trends for 2012–14, and measurements of 
their more recent effects on inequalities and poverty, are limited.

the two phases of the crisis. It is clear that, despite the 
significant contraction in 2011, a large number of coun-
tries (mostly in the developing world) were at that point 
still expanding social security. It must be noted that 
in many of these developing countries such expansion 
is being partly financed using the cost savings result-
ing from fiscal consolidation and adjustment measures 
such as reducing or eliminating subsidies (including 
food and fuel subsidies). The net social outcome effects 
remain to be studied and will inevitably vary from 
country to country. 

While a significant number of governments have 
adjusted their social protection systems since 2010, 
many developing countries have taken bold measures to 
extend social protection coverage and enhance at least 
the social assistance provided to the poorest segments 
of their populations (see figures 6.5 and 6.6). The strong 
push for the expansion of social protection started well 
before the onset of the global crisis, but has accelerated 
since 2009, sometimes as part of short-term fiscal stim-
ulus measures, often as part of longer-term structural 
policies aiming at promoting human and economic de-
velopment, as well as political stability.

6.2   High-income countries: Fiscal 

consolidation and its effects

The majority of high-income countries (HICs)6 have 
been engaged in long-term reforms of social protec-
tion pension systems since long before the crisis, under 
pressure from demographic change and the search for 
long-term sustainability. The recent fiscal consolidation 
policies have accelerated such changes, however, affect-
ing all areas of social protection.

6.2.1   Overview: Prioritizing financial sector 

recovery over social protection

The significant increases in social protection spending in 
the early phase of the crisis were broadly aimed at coun-
tervailing the exceptional severity of the economic down-
turn. There were, however, significant differences across 
countries: in late 2008 and 2009, while among European 
HICs such increases amounted to around 7 per cent in 
real terms, they exceeded 10 per cent in the entire OECD 
and reached 15 per cent in the United States, with their 
effect continuing through 2010 (OECD, 2012b). These 
increases crucially contributed to minimizing the social 
costs and limiting the economic impact of the crisis by 
avoiding a collapse of consumption and maintaining eco-
nomic activity (see section 6.2.2 below). 

The second phase of the crisis, beginning in 2010, 
saw a total policy reversal: annual spending growth 
slowed significantly, followed by a contraction in social 
expenditure in 2011 for many HICs. This reflected not 
a reduction in social protection needs, but rather a 180-
degree shift in governments’ public expenditure policy 
from 2010 onwards. The sovereign debt crisis in Europe 
turned public attention to government spending, as if 
it were this that had caused the crisis. However, gov-
ernment debt and deficits were symptoms of the crisis, 
not its cause. Rising debts and deficits at this point re-
sulted from bank bailouts to rescue the financial sector 
from bankruptcy, stimulus packages, and lower gov-
ernment revenues due to the slowdown in economic 

activity (figure 6.7). Yet fiscal consolidation focused on 
deep cutbacks to public policies and shrinking the State 
as the main way to fix the deficit, calm the markets and 
revitalize the economy; following this logic, the Euro-
pean social model was depicted as unaffordable and 
burdensome, which ultimately reduced competitiveness 
and discouraged growth.

When government policies shifted highest priority 
to servicing debt and achieving fiscal balances in 2010, 
employment and social protection became secondary 
priorities. Decisions were taken to reduce public ex-
penditures in most HICs, despite rising unemploy-
ment and poverty (see table 6.1 above). Public social 
expenditure in HICs has not kept pace with popula-
tions’ needs for income security and access to health 
and other social services. 

Overall, unemployment rose by more than 45 per 
cent, with more than 44 million unemployed in OECD 
HICs in 2013 compared to 2008, while expenditure 
on unemployment benefits and tax-funded social as-
sistance was initially increased but later reduced, with 
around half of those unemployed not receiving un-
employment benefits (ILO, 2014a; Annex IV, table B.3 
in this report). At the time of writing this report, there 
are large groups of people, many of them formerly in the 
middle class, living in conditions of poverty or near-pov-
erty in HICs; this situation is most evident in the crisis-
affected countries of Europe, where in 2012 there were 
9.5 million more poor people than in 2008, and child 
poverty was reported to be increasing at an alarming 
rate7 (figure 6.8). Rising unemployment and increased 
poverty on such a scale in so many European countries 
should have prompted measures to further strengthen 
social protection expenditure rather than curtailments 
informed by fiscal consolidation objectives.

Reductions in social protection were most severe 
in those HICs with the highest budget deficits, which 
were also those with the most limited social assistance 
programmes in place (Greece, Portugal and Ireland) 
(Vaughan-Whitehead, 2014).8 According to a recent 
OECD survey across more than 30 OECD countries, 
around half have been considering fiscal consolidation 

6  This section focuses mostly on HICs which are members of the OECD. The situation of other HICs is not discussed here as it mostly 
relates to countries where social protection developments resemble those of middle-income countries: for example, Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi 
Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, where aggregate social protection expenditure is less than 5 per cent of GDP (with the exception of 
Kuwait, where it amounts to 12 per cent of GDP), in comparison to an average of 22 per cent of GDP in OECD countries.
7  Eurostat data for 2012, except Ireland (2011); based on fixed poverty line as of 2008.
8  Greece reduced public spending by more than €30 billion or the equivalent of 10 per cent of GDP between 2009 and 2011, and an 
additional 8 per cent is expected to be saved by 2015 (Hermann, 2013; OECD, 2012c).The Irish austerity programme is also intended to 
save approximately 18 per cent of GDP by 2015, while Spain, Portugal, the United Kingdom and Hungary aim at 7–8 per cent of savings at 
least (Vaughan-Whitehead, 2014).

plans requiring adjustments of more than 5 per cent of 
GDP from 2009 to 2015, with a high predominance of 
direct spending cuts as opposed to revenue-side measures 
(figure 6.9). The survey indicates that the current fiscal 
consolidation plans are leading to a decline in social trans-
fers in cyclically adjusted terms in about half of OECD 
countries, while adjusted household taxes are expected 
at the same time to increase in most OECD countries.9

Social protection has frequently been targeted for 
expenditure reductions or freezes, in particular in the 
areas of unemployment benefits, health care, pensions 
and social assistance (see table 6.2). On the revenue side, 
measures have often aimed at increasing indirect taxes, 
such as VAT, which is reported to have increased on 
average by 1.8 percentage points in European Union 
member countries.10 Such increases in indirect taxes 

9  This result is based on an OECD survey of the consolidation strategies of over 30 governments between 2009 and 2015. Most governments 
reported plans to improve their public budgets primarily via spending restraints (Rawdanowicz, Wurzel and Christensen, 2013).
10  According to Eurostat, the average VAT rate in the EU was 19.4 per cent in 2008; by 2012, it had increased to 21.0 per cent.

World Social Protection Report 2014/156. Expanding social protection: Key to crisis recovery, inclusive development and social justice

Box 6.2  Using sovereign pension reserve funds to fund bailouts 

Sovereign pension reserve funds, normally established to support governments in funding future pension 
liabilities by complementing the accumulated funds from employers’ and workers’ contributions, have been 
tapped to a substantial extent during the course of the global crisis to help ease the strain on national public 
finances. In some cases they have been used them to finance interventions directly; in others, to support 
specific economic sectors facing difficulties or to guarantee loans. 

For example, the Irish National Pension Reserve Fund was used to recapitalize the Irish banking system as 
one of the solicited national contributions under the economic adjustment programme for Ireland. Another 
example is the Australian Future Fund, which received its last financial allocation from the government in 
2008, as a result of which its asset level is now considered to fall below its target level as determined by Aus-
tralia’s Government Actuary. The New Zealand Superannuation Fund, meanwhile, has increased its exposure 
to New Zealand’s domestic economy in response to the government’s advice to consider attractive invest-
ment opportunities in New Zealand. Here too, the government reduced the transfer of funds from the govern-
ment budget to the Fund in 2009/10 and suspended it in 2010/11; it is scheduled to resume in 2020/21.

disproportionately affect low income groups (Thomas 
and Picos-Sánchez, 2012).

In addition to these measures, some governments 
have had to look at available sources of funding to fi-
nance bailouts of financial institutions in trouble. The 
use of national pension funds, either through explicit 
loans and investment decisions or through non-ex-
plicit loan guarantees (see box 6.2), is cause for concern, 
as such funds are subject to rigorous performance 

objectives and targets as well as strict governance rules 
which now appear to be being sidestepped. Such pen-
sion assets usually represent the accumulated contribu-
tions of workers and employers towards guaranteeing 
their social security in old age, a demand ever more 
pressing as these societies age.

Overall, the deployment of vast public resources 
to rescue private institutions considered “too big to 
fail” and, to a lesser degree, to fund fiscal stimulus 

plans, caused sovereign debt to increase, forced taxpay-
ers to absorb the losses and, ultimately, hindered eco-
nomic growth (figure 6.10). Many governments have 
curtailed government consumption and investment 
and also reduced social benefits, thus creating a vicious 
circle: reductions in infrastructure investment and 
public sector wages, as well as cuts in social security, 
further depressed aggregate demand in the economy, 
in consequence reducing the demand for labour, and 
thus in turn increasing unemployment, reducing rev-
enues from income taxation and narrowing the avail-
able fiscal envelope, thereby adding pressure to further 
reduce social transfers. The cost of adjustment has been 
passed on to populations, who have now been attempt-
ing to cope with fewer jobs, lower income and reduced 
access to public goods and services for more than five 
years.

6.2.2   First phase of the crisis: Scaling up social 

protection to sustain households’ disposable 
income and domestic demand (2008–09) 

The automatic provision of unemployment insurance 
benefits in the early phase of the crisis demonstrated 
the counter-cyclical role of such schemes, where funded 
from accumulated contributions with a view to meeting 
increased benefit expenditures during economic down-
turns. In a number of countries, these schemes were 
scaled up to facilitate access to benefits in the face of 
massive unemployment. For example, the United States 
extended the maximum duration for paying benefits 
as job opportunities were too few to accommodate the 
increased numbers of unemployed. Other countries, 
such as Germany, adjusted their legal frameworks to 
allow companies in certain sectors to introduce a tem-
porary reduction in working time, compensated for by 
social protection benefits, in order to avoid job cuts.

Other examples of good practice include special stimu-
lus packages incorporating urgently needed social assis-
tance benefits for the growing number of poor. These 
and other such short-term adjustments limited the fall 
in citizens’ purchasing power and thus also the decline 
in global aggregate demand. 

Data from the United States, Japan, France and 
Germany from 2009 to early 2010 provide evidence of 
the counter-cyclical automatic economic and social sta-
bilizer function of social protection expenditure, espe-
cially of the role played by special fiscal stimuli to scale 
up short-term benefits for the unemployed and the poor 
in reversing the downward trend of private consump-
tion expenditure (figure 6.11).11

Further evidence of the counter-cyclical effect of 
social protection is provided by analysis of different 
components of growth in private disposable income 
over time. Before the crisis, labour income, net social 
benefits, taxes and property income varied across eco-
nomic cycles such that gross disposable real income in-
creased by around 4 per cent annually in the European 
Area up to 2008 (figure 6.12). Then, in 2009 and early 
2010, populations in a majority of countries experienced 

significant declines in their incomes from earnings and 
other sources of market income, due to increased un-
employment, reductions in working time and earnings, 
and declining profits and other capital incomes. 

On average, incomes from earnings and capital 
(market incomes) dwindled by 1.9 per cent per year in 
real terms across the OECD over this period; however, 
in some countries, such as Greece, Iceland and New 
Zealand, market incomes dropped by more than 7 per 
cent per year (figure 6.13). Increased social transfers 
and other elements of the special fiscal stimuli played a 
particularly strong role in cushioning the effects of a re-
duction of market incomes in countries such as Estonia, 
Ireland, New Zealand and Spain. In other countries, 
where regular and adequate social protection benefits 
were not available, no such cushioning effect against 
the drastic falls in households’ disposable income could 
be observed. From 2010 up to early 2012, the earnings 
component added on average 2 percentage points to 
growth of disposable incomes, while changes in reduced 
social benefits clearly worked in the opposite direction. 
However, the evidence of the counter-cyclical au-
tomatic economic and social stabilizer function of 

11  In Germany, where 26 per cent of GDP was spent on public social protection in 2012, four stimulus packages were introduced from 
2008, with the main aim of preserving jobs. Their cost as of 2011 amounted to about 4 per cent of 2008 GDP (compared to 19.8 per cent 
spent on the rescue of the financial sector). In France, where 32 per cent of GDP in 2012 was spent on social protection, extraordinary fiscal 
rescue efforts were more modest, representing (as of 2011) 1.6 per cent of 2008 GDP (compared to 19.0 per cent spent on the rescue of the 
financial sector). In the United States, where 20 per cent of GDP in 2012 was spent on social protection, there was one main extraordinary 
stimulus package in 2008 and some lesser ones afterwards. As of 2011, their cost amounted to about 5.6 per cent of the 2008 GDP 
(compared to 5.1 per cent spent on the rescue of the financial sector).

social protection expenditure observed in 2009 and 
early 2010 was not enough to contain the pressure from 
financial markets, ratings agencies and orthodox ap-
proaches to adopt adjustment measures in social pro-
tection programmes from 2010. Instead of joining with 
social partners in looking for alternative responses to 
the crisis that could have enabled them to accommo-
date structural reform without undermining social 
rights or exacerbating the hardship experienced by en-
terprises, the governments of most HICs adopted fiscal 
consolidation policies, including reductions in benefit 
entitlements and durations. Negative outcomes during 
this deep and protracted economic downturn are seen 
not only in increased poverty but also in the gradual 
economic effects of reduced aggregate private consump-
tion (see section 6.2.3). 

Despite the cushioning and consumption-stabiliz-
ing effects of taxes and transfers, the crisis effectively 
depressed disposable incomes in many OECD coun-
tries, with in many cases negative knock-on effects on 
private consumption and aggregate demand. Overall, 
between 2007 and 2010 private households suffered an 
annual decline in their disposable incomes of as much 
as 8.4 per cent in Iceland and between 2 and 4 per cent 
in Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Mexico, New 
Zealand and Spain (figure 6.13). This effect was further 
sharpened by the internal devaluations pursued in some 
countries of the eurozone.

6.2.3   Second phase of the global crisis:  
Fiscal consolidation, 2010 onwards

The turn towards fiscal consolidation measures in the 
second phase of the crisis, from 2010 onwards, reversed 
the expansionary stance typical of responses to the first 
phase and included various measures to reduce bene-
fits. This coincided with the policy reversal adopted by 
the IMF Board and endorsed by the OECD and the 
G20 (box 6.1). More recently, IMF Chief Economist 
Olivier Blanchard has admitted serious underestima-
tion of fiscal multipliers with respect to the depth of 
the economic contraction in the design of fiscal con-
solidation policies (Blanchard and Leigh, 2013); also, 
IMF research has acknowledged that fiscal consolida-
tion has adverse effects on both short- and long-term 
unemployment, private demand and GDP growth, 
with wage earners hurt disproportionately more than 
profit- and rent-earners (Guajardo, Leigh and Pescatori, 
2011; Ball, Leigh and Loungani, 2011), and that pol-
icies that sustain aggregate demand are still critically 
important (Blanchard, Jaumotte and Loungani, 2013). 
Nevertheless, at the time fiscal consolidation policies 
were adopted across HICs, with spending cuts targeted 
in particular on short-term benefits, such as unemploy-
ment benefits, family benefits and family support pro-
grammes, thus making it more difficult for households 
to maintain a life in dignity with at least a minimum

income security, especially for many families with 
children. Following recent reforms, some European 
countries may no longer be compliant with the require-
ments of the ILO’s Social Security (Minimum Stand-
ards) Convention, 1952 (No. 102), which most of them 
have ratified. Table 6.2 provides an overview of some 
of the main measures adopted during the global crisis.

Unemployment benefits

Access to unemployment benefits, and the levels and 
maximum duration of payments, were reduced starting 
in 2010 (see also Chapter 3, section 3.2). Increases in 
poverty have been attributed in part to such reductions 
in protection: one recent study, for example, argues that 
increases in poverty in the United States stem directly 
from cuts to unemployment benefits (CBPP, 2014). 

In countries with advance-funding approaches, un-
employment benefits from 2008 to early 2010 were fi-
nanced from current contributions and reserve funds 
accumulated under unemployment insurance (UI) 
schemes. However, as high unemployment rates per-
sisted beyond 2010, UI reserve funds started to run out. 
Increases to UI contribution rates were then considered, 
although there was reluctance from employers, who 
argued on the contrary for pro-cyclical support in the 
form of lower social security contributions. This high-
lights the importance of promoting counter-cyclical UI 
funding in countries without advance-funding policies 
to ensure the availability of reasonable UI funds during 
future economic downturns. The advance funding of 
unemployment benefits in reasonable proportions and 
within a well-governed framework could help to ease 
the pressure on public budgets during downturns, when 
needs are high and revenues are falling, and when the 
business sector is less receptive to possible contribution 
increases. 

Health

Most governments have initiated reforms in health 
protection systems, such as rationalizing the costs 
of public health facilities, introducing patient co-
payments and cutting wage bills for medical staff. 

Increased out-of-pocket expenditures for health add 
further pressure on governments to increase pensions 
and other social protection benefits to cover the add-
itional cost for households of seeking necessary health 
care. Meanwhile, a lower quality of health service 
provision leads to worse health outcomes (e.g. Kara-
nikolos et al., 2013; Mladovsky et al., 2012). Weak-
ened mental health, increased substance abuse and 
higher suicide rates have all been linked with fiscal 
consolidation measures (WHO, 2011a; Stuckler and 
Basu, 2013). The European Centre for Disease Con-
trol warned that serious health hazards are emerging 
because of the fiscal consolidation measures introduced 
since 2008.12 More specifically, in Greece, Spain and 
Portugal citizens’ access to public health care services 
has been seriously constrained, to the extent that there 
are reported increases in mortality and morbidity. The 
Lancet speaks of “a Greek public health tragedy” in 
which citizens are subject to one of the most radical 
programmes of welfare state retrenchment in recent 
times (Kentikelinis et al., 2014). 

Social benefits

The vast array of tax-financed allowances such as child 
allowances, disability benefits and housing support 
have been rationalized during the crisis in the search 
for cost savings. The negative effects of fiscal consolida-
tion on poverty have been most noticeable in countries 
where the basic system of social assistance is weak or 
has been recently weakened, as in some of the crisis-hit 
Baltic States and the European countries under ratified 
economic adjustment programmes. The Government 
in Greece, for instance, is planning drastic structural 
changes to replace a large number of existing social 
benefits, such as disability and family benefits, as well 
as the minimum pension provided under social insur-
ance schemes, with a safety net for the poorest, a single 
targeted guaranteed minimum income scheme provid-
ing a relatively low benefit. Ireland is also replacing a 
universal child benefit by a means-tested allowance to 
low-income families. The introduction of means testing 
for previously universal benefits, and the more narrow 
targeting of benefits on people living in poverty, erodes 
the principles of universal protection which used to be 

12  In January 2013, doctors from Portugal, Spain, Ireland and Greece sent an open letter to European political leaders and health 
authorities in which they deplored the effects that financial and economic decisions adopted as a response to the economic crisis were having 
on the health of the populations of their countries and called for immediate action to reverse this situation: http://www.epha.org/spip.

part of the social contract in many European countries, 
based on legal rights. For instance, fiscal consolidation 
measures have restricted the access of persons with dis-
abilities to community living, education, primary care 
and assistance. Cuts in gender equality programmes, 
child-care services, parental and child benefits, services 
to victims of violence and legal aid affect women in par-
ticular (EU Commissioner for Human Rights, 2013). 

Pensions

Common pension reforms include raising the retire-
ment age, reducing benefits, increasing contribution 
rates and reducing pension tax exemptions, as well as 
the structural reforms introduced in some countries. 
Most countries were introducing changes to their pen-
sion systems prior to the crisis, in view of the demo-
graphic ageing of populations, but fiscal consolidation 
precipitated drastic cost-saving measures adopted with-
out adequate consideration of their social impacts. 
Some of these reforms have been contested in national 
constitutional courts. A good measure by which to 
grasp the effect of reforms is the gross theoretical re-
placement rate for public (statutory) pensions. Simula-
tions show future pensioners receiving lower pensions 
in at least 14 European countries, with a projected de-
cline by more than 10 percentage points in eight coun-
tries (figure 6.14).13 

Most structural pension reforms in HICs that have 
introduced the principle of individual savings have re-
moved the de facto minimum pension guarantees that 
used to be explicitly provided under traditional “de-
fined benefit” pension systems (some of which are still 
in existence). In addition, numerous reforms have fur-
ther eroded the purchasing power of pensions through 
indexation measures limiting their adjustment to a level 
below changes in prices and wages: Spain, for instance, 
stopped indexing pensions to price inflation in 2013.14 
These changes result in more older persons not having 
sufficient income security: pensioners become poorer 
and poorer as they grow older and the real value of their 
pension dwindles in the absence of adequate indexation 
mechanisms. In Sweden and Poland, for instance, pov-
erty rates for older persons have nearly doubled, from 
10 to 18 per cent and from 7 to 14 per cent respectively

between 2005 and 2012 (see Chapter 4). There is a need 
to revisit pension provisions to ensure that explicit pro-
vision is made for minimum benefit guarantees through 
contributory pension systems or via coordinated pol-
icies with non-contributory social assistance benefits.

Overall,  the  ILO  expects  that  more  and  more 
workers will have to resort to tax-financed social as-
sistance or guaranteed minimum income schemes 
in their old age as a result of the pension reforms of 
the past decade or so. Some national pension systems 
will no longer meet the adequacy requirements they 
are required to fulfil in countries that have ratified the 
European Code of Social Security and the ILO’s Con-
vention No. 102 – which is the case for a majority of 
European countries. 

Erosion of the European social model 

In 2012, 123 million people in the then 27 Member 
States of the European Union, representing 24 per cent 
of the population, were at risk of poverty or social exclu-
sion, compared to 116 million in 2008, and as many as 

13  Since these projections were made, Portugal, Spain, Greece and Italy have adopted further austerity measures to reduce future pension 
entitlements under their public systems (EU Social Protection Committee, 2009; European Commission, 2012c).

800,000 more children than in 2008 were living in pov-
erty.15 These figures raised alarm across Europe. Some 
estimates foresee an additional 15–25 million people 
facing the prospect of living in poverty by 2025 if fiscal 
consolidation continues (Oxfam, 2013). Higher poverty 
and inequality are the results not only of the severity 
of the global recession, but also of specific policy deci-
sions curtailing social transfers and limiting access to 
quality public services. The achievements of the Euro-
pean social model,16 which dramatically reduced poverty 
and promoted prosperity in the period following the 
Second World War, have been eroded during and since 
the crisis by a series of adjustment reforms that have led 
to a resurgence of poverty in Europe and a loss of pros-
perity for the middle classes. The long-accepted concept 
of universal access to decent living conditions for all citi-
zens has been threatened by a widening gulf between 
more narrowly targeted programmes for those at the 
lower levels of the income distribution and a stronger 
emphasis on individual savings for the middle and upper 
income groups. This fragmentation of social security sys-
tems limits the potential for a collective pooling of risk, 
erodes social solidarity, limits the responsibility of the 
State to the care of only the extremely poor, and changes 
the terms of the social contract that has been at the very 
basis of the European social model. The weakening of 
collective bargaining and social dialogue, along with the 
deregulation and “flexibilization” of labour markets, has 
further compounded this erosion (ILO, 2013b; IILS, 
2012; Vaughan-Whitehead, 2013).

Furthermore, while cost savings from fiscal consoli-
dation measures may have assisted in servicing debt, 
they have not supported economic growth. In Ireland, 
Greece, Portugal and Cyprus, where some of the bold-
est structural reforms have taken place as part of the 
terms agreed under the different economic adjustment 
programmes adopted by these countries since 2008, 
disposable household incomes have declined in conse-
quence, as a result of high unemployment, lower wages 
and social protection expenditure cuts, and this in 
turn has led to lower consumption (figure 6.15). For 
example, in Greece the reform of the social protec-
tion system limits the responsibility of the State to a 

guaranteed minimum income benefit targeted on the 
poor, which is provisionally set at a low level equiva-
lent to 75 per cent of the current average minimum 
pension guarantee. The reform foresees that supple-
mentary pensions will likely become the responsibil-
ity of individuals and employers (through a system of 
individual accounts); this replaces a system, albeit a 
very fragmented one, of dubious sustainability, under 
which in the past nearly every person could count on 
having at least a minimum old-age pension. As salaries 
decreased by nearly 35 per cent and unemployment 
increased to 28 per cent between 2008 and the end of 
2013, the revenues from contributions to the social se-
curity system have dwindled. Continuing to pay social 
security benefits would have required deficit financing, 
but this was not prioritized. Instead, curtailments in-
formed by fiscal consolidation objectives have reduced 
social protection expenditure by more than 12 per cent 
in real terms since 2008, and private consumption fol-
lowed the same downward path (figure 6.15, panel (b)). 
Inevitably, poverty in Greece rose to a historically high 
level, exceeding 35 per cent of the population in 2013, 
inflicting intense human suffering as many families 
found themselves unable to access any longer the basic 
necessities for a life in dignity. Trade union activ-
ists speak of “a programmed impoverishment of the 
population”.17 

Other countries under severe pressure from fi-
nancial markets, such as Italy and Spain, also intro-
duced reforms that were more far-reaching than in 
countries where the debt crisis was less acute, such 
as France or Belgium, or marginal, as in Germany. 
While some reforms were aimed at making necessary 
improvements in administrative efficiency, others rep-
resented a shift away from an approach focusing on 
the prevention of poverty and of income insecurity for 
the entire population towards an approach limited to 
poverty alleviation (“safety nets”). Such reforms have 
disproportionately emphasized the fiscal objective of 
balan cing public budgets without due consideration 
to the objective of adequate benefits to all people, as 
promulgated in various international instruments  
– including, among others, ILO Convention No. 102, 

15  According to Eurostat, “at risk of poverty or social exclusion” means that they were at risk of poverty (set at 60 per cent of the national 
median equivalized disposable income, after social transfers), severely materially deprived and/or living in households with very low work 
intensity (Eurostat, 2013).
16  Recent ILO research identifies the following key features of the European social model: (1) increased minimum rights on working 
conditions, (2) universal and sustainable social protection systems, (3) inclusive labour markets, (4) strong and well-functioning social 
dialogue, (5) public services and services of general interest, and (6) social inclusion and social cohesion (Vaughan-Whitehead, 2013).

the Invalidity, Old-Age and Survivors’ Benefits Con-
vention, 1967 (No. 128), and the Social Protection 
Floors Recommendation, 2012 (No. 202). Such dis-
equilibrium constitutes a significant danger for social 
cohesion and social justice, and contributes to the ero-
sion of the  European social model.

In some European countries, courts have reviewed 
the constitutional validity of fiscal consolidation meas-
ures. In 2013, the Portuguese constitutional court 
ruled that four fiscal consolidation measures in the 
budget, mainly affecting civil servants and pension-
ers, were unlawful and in breach of the country’s con-
stitution. In Latvia, the 2010 budget proposed new 
spending cuts and tax increases, including a 10 per cent 
cut in pensions and a 70 per cent decrease for work-
ing pensioners; the constitutional court ruled that the 

pension cuts were unconstitutional on the grounds 
that they violated the right to social security, and the 
cuts had to be reversed. In Romania, 15 per cent pen-
sion cuts proposed in May 2010 were also declared un-
constitutional; although pensions partly funded by 
worker contributions are constitutionally protected, 
the Government had circumvented this protection on 
the grounds of a separate constitutional article allow-
ing the temporary limitation of certain rights in order 
to defend national security (UNDP and RCPAR, 
2011; OHCHR, 2013). More recently, the European 
Parliament has launched an inquiry into the demo-
cratic legitimacy of adjustment reforms and their social 
impacts in Ireland, Cyprus, Spain, Slovenia, Greece, 
Portugal and Italy (European Parliament, 2014a; Euro-
pean Parliament, 2014b).

World Social Protection Report 2014/156. Expanding social protection: Key to crisis recovery, inclusive development and social justice

6.2.4   Adequate transfers, taxes and social 
dialogue: Key elements of a socially 
responsive recovery

Social protection plays a role in preventing as well as re-
ducing poverty in all societies, although the potential of 
different social protection systems to prevent and reduce 
poverty varies. For example, without social protection 
transfers and tax measures, 32.2 per cent of the people 
of Finland would have found themselves in poverty in 
2010, as opposed to the 7.3 per cent of the population 
who actually were in poverty that year. Figure 6.16 sets 
out the effective poverty prevention and reduction cap-
acity of national transfers and tax systems in OECD 
countries. It shows quite significant differences between 
countries, even for those at a similar level of economic 
development and potential fiscal resources, illustrating 
the point that it is the political will of each society that 
sets the framework for its social protection system. 

Social protection supports growth and structural 
change in the labour market. It also supports household 
income, essential to sustain consumption and domestic 
demand. Adequate levels of social protection are an im-
portant element of an inclusive growth strategy, as out-
lined in the various sections of this report. 

Integrating social protection, employment and tax-
ation policies is key to a socially responsive recovery. 
The increase in poverty and inequalities reflects to a 
large extent not just the recent crisis, but a longer-term 
trend weakening the State’s developmental role and re-
distributive capacity (e.g. OECD, 2008; OECD, 2011a; 
UNRISD, 2010). Global imbalances may be further 
exacerbated as households increase their precaution-
ary savings because they have lost trust in the capacity 
and/or willingness of the public system to provide for 
their long-term income security. This situation calls 
for effective coordination of social protection, employ-
ment and fiscal policies to better address emerging cir-
cumstances in the labour market and to avert lasting 
damage to their knock-on effects on current and future 
levels of social protection for all, including not only the 
poorer segments of society but also the middle class. 
Countries are encouraged to make better use of their 
social protection systems in order to avoid a rupture in 
solidarity across generations and income groups, and to 
achieve social peace.

National dialogue and consultations on alternative 
policy options can achieve an optimal balance between 
adequacy and sustainability. ILO country surveys in 
Europe have indicated that most reforms adopted 
during the crisis have been introduced without due 

regard to consultations with social partners and key 
stakeholders in civil society (e.g. Guardiancich, 2012). 
As a result, those reforms tend to be unbalanced, over-
emphasizing the cost-effectiveness dimension with a 
view to restoring public finances, while overlooking 
the social outcomes in terms of poverty and inequality. 
National dialogue is essential to secure adequate social 
protection measures, particularly with regard to pro-
tecting children and older persons from poverty and 
vulnerability, and to ensure that necessary adjustments 
are based on a fair and viable balance between adequacy 
and sustainability, as part of the core social contract on 
which modern societies are based.

The Social Protection Committee of the European 
Commission stressed in late 2013 that lessons must be 
learnt from recent reform experiences, that policy cor-
rections must be considered on the basis of robust social 
impact assessments of both short- and long-term effects

Box 6.3  Iceland: A socially responsive recovery from the crisis

Iceland repudiated private debt to foreign banks and did not bail out its financial sector, pushing losses on 
to bondholders instead of taxpayers. This was not a sovereign debt issue; according to the IMF, this debt 
was a result of privatization and deregulation of the banking sector, facilitated by easy access to foreign 
funding; the growing imbalances were not detected by Iceland’s financial sector supervision. Two national 
referendums, held in 2010 and 2011, allowed citizens to vote on whether and how the country should repay 
a nationalized private debt; Icelandic voters delivered a resounding “no” to the orthodox policies that would 
have accompanied such a debt repayment plan. Despite the pressures and threats elicited by Iceland’s 
heterodox policies – debt repudiation, capital controls and currency depreciation – the country is recov-
ering well from the crisis (Krugman, 2012). It has regained access to international capital markets while 
preserving the welfare of its citizens, with support from the IMF. In 2012, Iceland’s credit rating was much 
higher than Greece’s. As Iceland’s IMF Article IV Consultation stated:

A key post crisis objective of the Icelandic authorities was to preserve the social welfare system in the 
face of the fiscal consolidation needed. Wage increases, agreed among the social partners in May 2011, led 
to a rise in nominal wages of 6 per cent and the unemployment rate fell to about 7 per cent in 2012. …

… In designing fiscal adjustment, the authorities introduced a more progressive income tax and created 
fiscal space to preserve social benefits. Consequently, when expenditure compression began in 2010, 
social protection spending continued to rise as a per cent of GDP, and the number of households receiving 
income support from the public sector increased. These policies led to a sharp reduction in inequality. 
Iceland’s Gini coefficient – which had risen during the boom – fell in 2010 to levels consistent with its 
Nordic peers (IMF, 2012, pp. 5–6).

and, above all, that such analysis should be available 
before policies are adopted.18 The ILO encourages all 
countries to re-establish national policy dialogue with 
the social partners and all other parts of civil society to 
explore the optimal policy options that effectively ad-
dress poverty and inequalities. 

There are examples of good approaches. The Nordic 
social model is not only resilient but has been actively 
used in crises. Finland, for example, ring-fenced its 
health and social protection system during the major 
economic crisis it faced in the 1990s after the down-
fall of the former Soviet Union, at a time when the 
Nordic social model was heavily criticized for impeding 
growth. More recently, Nordic countries have reformed 
while preserving the fundamental values of their social 
model, and are now well placed to face the aftermath 
of the global crisis, both economically and socially (see 
box 6.3). Other good examples include measures taken 
during the early phase of the crisis to scale up targeted 
assistance: in the United States, for example, the food 
subsidies for the poor which cut the number of house-
holds living in extreme poverty by half, and the Afford-
able Health Care Act of 2013 which introduced health 
coverage for all citizens (CBPP, 2014).

Other significant examples include social protection 
measures that were already in place before the crisis and 

could be easily scaled up when conditions dramatically 
worsened, such as the unemployment insurance scheme 
in Germany, which could provide adapted benefits to 
help limit lay-offs, or the French reforms to provide 
firms with incentives for retaining older workers while 
also hiring younger workers.

6.3   Middle-income countries: Inclusive 

growth through social protection

6.3.1   Significant extension  

of social protection coverage

In many middle-income countries, the dominant trend 
of recent years, starting well before the global crisis of 
2008, has been that of an expansion of social protection 
coverage, yet with wide cross-national variation. Many 
social protection policy reforms explicitly acknowledged 
the importance of investments in health, education and 
social protection, in order to foster inclusive growth 
and poverty reduction in the short term, and to build 
human capital and human capacities in the longer term. 
In many ways, these policies mark a clear break with 
some of the policies of the 1980s and 1990s, which em-
phasized cutbacks to the public sector, the introduction 

18  The EU Social Protection Committee concluded in September 2013 that “social impact assessments must become part of the Economic 
Adjustment Programmes in order to choose the most appropriate path of reforms and adjust the resulting distribution impact across income 
and age groups” (EU Social Protection Committee, 2013, p. 26).

World Social Protection Report 2014/156. Expanding social protection: Key to crisis recovery, inclusive development and social justice

of user fees for health, education and other public ser-
vices, and the privatization of pensions. The experience 
of the fiscal and economic crises of the late 1990s in 
Asia and Latin America prompted many countries to 
reconsider their economic models. The new policies rec-
ognize a more active role of the State in fostering social 
and economic development and strengthening domes-
tic demand. The strong emphasis on social protection 
policies in many middle-income countries is a powerful 
testimony to the premise that sustainable and equit-
able growth cannot be achieved in the absence of strong 
social protection policies and the progressive extension 
of social security coverage to much larger groups of the 
population (ILO, 2010b; ILO, 2011a; ILO, 2012a). 

Several middle-income countries, including Argen-
tina, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Namibia, 
South Africa and Thailand, have significantly extended 
various elements of their social protection systems, 
particularly since the early 2000s, with remark able 
outcomes (see, e.g. Fiszbein and Schady, 2009; ILO, 
2010b; ISSA, 2013). These efforts were temporarily dis-
rupted in some parts of the world by the global crisis, 
the effects of which compounded those the food and 
fuel crises in various ways. Some countries rebounded 
after 2010 in terms of economic growth, but still saw an 
increase in vulnerable and informal employment, and 
their economic positions remain exposed to the uncer-
tain recovery of global demand.

Several countries, which recently joined the ranks 
of middle-income countries or graduated from least 
developed country status, such as Cabo Verde, Ghana, 
Lesotho and Zambia, have implemented distinct social 
protection policies aiming at gradually extending social 

protection to larger groups of the population, in so far 
as available national and external resources allow, as 
part of their development strategies.

Many reforms have focused on non-contributory 
schemes and programmes, such as conditional or un-
conditional cash transfers for children and families, 
social pensions, and/or employment guarantee schemes. 
Many countries have also rendered their social insur-
ance programmes more equitable, more effective and 
more sustainable, although many are also still strug-
gling to bring the majority of informal workers, espe-
cially in rural areas into the formal economy. These 
reforms contributed to further extension of national 
social protection systems, while ensuring that at least 
a minimum level of social security is guaranteed in the 
form of a national social protection floor. 

Table 6.3 and the map in figure 6.6 above illustrate 
the wide range of recent efforts to extend social pro-
tection in middle-income countries, both through the 
introduction of new schemes and programmes and the 
significant expansion of existing ones. 

The large number of middle-income countries that 
have extended social protection demonstrates a signifi-
cant prioritization of social protection policies in this 
group of countries in recent years, highlighted by the 
fact that many middle-income countries have also sig-
nificantly expanded the envelope of resources allocated 
to social protection. 

Good rates of economic development have con-
tributed to the observed significant increases in social 
protection expenditure ratios in many middle-income 
countries, although a wide variation in expenditure 
levels persists. Since 2000, 14 out of the 32 countries

included in figure 6.17 have increased the proportion 
of GDP invested in public social protection (including 
health) by more than 3 per cent of GDP. 

6.3.2   Towards more inclusive growth 

Many middle-income countries have enjoyed relatively 
high rates of economic growth since 2000. This growth 
has helped to enlarge fiscal space, broaden the revenue 
base of the State and facilitated the strengthening of 
public administrations, all of which are conducive to 
the extension of social protection. Taking advantage 
of this opportunity, some Latin American and Asian 
economies, having learnt from the financial crises they 
faced in the 1980s, late 1990s and again in the early 
2000s, have been expanding social protection mech-
anisms to better protect the most vulnerable groups of 
their population, and to enable the population to better 
cope with social risks and contingencies. 

Most importantly, the crisis has triggered a shift 
in the way developing countries see the relationship 
between growth and social protection. When emerging 
economies found demand for their exports falling, pol-
icy-makers started questioning unsustainable export-led 
growth models and moving instead towards recovery 
strategies centred on building up domestic consump-
tion and internal markets. One way to raise household 
income and thereby domestic consumption is through 
improved social protection systems. 

With the aim of moving economies on to a more 
sustainable development path, the extension of social 
protection has been seen as an investment to foster 
a healthier, better educated and more highly skilled 
workforce capable of responding to new demands 
and to support the transition to the higher levels of 
productivity necessary to sustain economic growth 
(ILO, 2011a; ILO, 2014b; see also figures 6.23 and 
6.24 below). Such measures can contribute to overcom-
ing a “middle income trap” of stagnating growth due 
to unbalanced growth trajectories (IMF, 2013c; Aiyar 
et al., 2013). The expansion of effective social protection 
mechanisms for the whole population, particularly for 
the middle classes, is also considered to be an effective 
way to counter disproportionately high precautionary 
savings rates, which can hold back aggregate domestic 
demand and contribute to global imbalances (Padoan, 
2010; Social Protection Floor Advisory Group, 2011). 
In fact, many middle-income countries have pur-
sued the expansion of their social protection systems ex-
plicitly with the objective of investing in human capital 
and human capabilities, with a view to achieving more 
sustainable and inclusive growth. 

The expansion of social protection coverage in 
Brazil (see box 6.4), China (see box 6.5) and Thailand 
are particularly instructive examples, as in these cases 
the extension of social security coverage was embedded 
in a broader approach aimed at moving the economy 
to a more inclusive and more sustainable growth pat-
tern, which included also measures to reform minimum

Box 6.4  The role of social protection in the Brazilian model of domestic demand-led growth 

When the financial crisis hit Brazil in 2008, the Brazilian economy, which had hitherto benefited greatly 
from favourable terms of trade and growing exports of commodities, suffered severely from a sharp decline 
in exports and a credit crunch among private Brazilian banks. This resulted in a loss of 695,000 formal jobs 
in November and December 2008 (see CAGED/IPEADATA) and a fall in GDP of 4.4 per cent in the fourth 
quarter of 2008 (Berg and Tobin, 2011, p. 5). To counterbalance the decline in exports, the government 
responded with a strategy of domestic demand-led growth. This strategy had two pillars: boosting domestic 
consumption by increasing family incomes and stimulating domestic investments. To the latter end, a 
fiscal stimulus package of US$20 billion (1.2 per cent of GDP) was launched, focusing on investments in 
infrastructure and the establishment of credit lines for sectors experiencing difficulties. To support domestic 
demand, tax cuts for middle-income households and social policies focusing on the poorest were financed 
through the stimulus package. Besides guaranteeing the maintenance of the existing social protection 
programmes and compliance with previous commitments, the Government extended the conditional cash 
transfer programme Bolsa Família to 1.3 million additional extremely poor families; in addition, the duration 
of unemployment insurance payments was extended by two months for people who had been working in 
sectors strongly hit by the crisis, benefiting some 310,000 people. Although quantitatively the investments 
in social protection seem comparably small, accounting for only 2.4 per cent of the stimulus package, the 
existing comprehensive network of social policies allowed for a quick reaction at low cost by means of 
scaling up relevant programmes; this had a very significant impact, reaching over 1.6 million of the most 
vulnerable people. Outside the stimulus package, the Government also maintained the real increases in the 
official minimum wage scheduled for February 2009 and January 2010. It is estimated that in 2009 this 
affected more than 20 per cent of the population, principally those on lower incomes.

Social policies and increases in the minimum wage thus helped to maintain or even increase the incomes 
of the poorest, and this in turn contributed to domestic demand growth. Despite a decrease in GDP in 
2009 of 0.6 per cent, private consumption remained stable and in the second half of 2009 was already 
beginning to grow again (Berg and Tobin, 2011, p. 7). This had multiplier effects on the economy, boosting 
employment and incomes and contributing substantially to its recovery. By 2010, GDP had grown again by 
an impressive 7.5 per cent (IMF, 2013a). The stronger accent on domestic-led growth has not broken the 
prevailing trend in reducing inequality, as shown by the continued drop of the Gini index from 0.54 in 2008 
to 0.526 in 2012 (IPEA, 2013, p. 11). Thus, by boosting the incomes of the lower and middle classes, social 
protection helped mitigate the impact of the crisis on the most vulnerable and functioned as an important 
element of the domestic demand-led growth policy implemented by the Brazilian Government as a response 
to the crisis. The case of Brazil also proves that income policies can promote economic growth while re-
ducing poverty and inequality.

wages. These countries have implemented a package of 
economic and social policies combining contributory 
and non-contributory programmes to reinforce their 
national social protection floors and strengthen their 
social security systems. These have been coordinated 
with employment policies, and particular emphasis has 
been placed on making the benefits and services ac-
cessible to the population through an integrated ap-
proach. These governments have not focused exclusively 
on reducing poverty by targeting social protection 
measures on the poorest, but have pursued a broader 
strategy, which also helped low income earners and the 
middle classes to improve their living standards sustain-
ably. These cases highlight the importance of coherent 
strategies that embed social policies in a wider range 
of coordinated employment, labour market, fiscal and 
macroeconomic policies. 

While some middle-income countries have man-
aged to reduce inequalities significantly, more efforts 

are necessary in this area (UNDP, 2014; UN, 2013b). 
Here the social protection system plays a particularly 
important role as one of the channels through which 
the benefits of growth can be shared in a more equit-
able way: not only in its direct impact on redistribution 
through social transfers and contributions, but also in 
more indirect ways by facilitating access to health and 
education. Investing in the extension of social protec-
tion, as many middle-income countries have done, helps 
to contain inequality and its negative effects on growth, 
and allow countries to follow a more equitable and more 
sustainable growth path (e.g. Berg and Ostry, 2011; 
Ostry et al., 2014). Such an approach is, indeed, par-
ticularly relevant for middle-income countries, which 
now are the home of the majority of the world’s poor 
(Sumner, 2010). In this context, social protection mech-
anisms play a particularly important role in reducing 
and preventing poverty, containing inequality, ensuring 
equitable life chances and fostering social inclusion.

Box 6.5  Strengthening domestic demand-led growth in China through increased wages  

and an expansion of social protection benefits

Since the middle of the century’s first decade, China’s five-year plans have recognized the need to address 
rapidly growing income inequalities and to provide income security to all the people of China, who place 
great trust in the public social security system. 

Income disparities between the rural and urban populations, between its more developed and less de-
veloped regions, among various groups of the population and among different sectors of the economy have 
been a recurrent concern of the national authorities. The other key social challenges in China are providing 
for income security, ensuring equal and affordable access to health, education and housing, and generating 
enough employment for both urban and rural populations. From the economic perspective, strengthening 
aggregate domestic demand and consumption has become one of the national priorities since the start of 
the global economic crisis, given the consequent lower demand for Chinese exports. 

The Government has clearly seen the links between these economic and social challenges and decided 
to address them as closely as possible. The rapid economic growth China has experienced since the late 
1970s has built up the country’s economic and fiscal capacity for the expansion of its social security 
system. Accordingly, alongside the economic expansion strategy, priority has been given to the following 
initiatives, among others:
•  In 2003 and 2007, two new social health insurance schemes were established for, respectively, the 
rural population and the previously uninsured part of the urban population. These, together with other 
existing health insurance schemes, now cover a total of 1.34 billion people, more than 96 per cent of the 
population. 

•  The adequacy of health insurance benefits was improved to ensure equal and effective access to health 
care. This took several forms, such as increasing reimbursement rates, extending the range of reimburs-
able items, raising the cap for reimbursement, introducing insurance for high out-of-pocket payments, 
reforming the public health sector, and investing more in rural health facilities and urban community-
based health centres.

•  In 2009 and 2011, two new old-age pension schemes were introduced, again for the rural population and 
uninsured urban residents. The goal was to achieve universal coverage by 2020; in fact, this was already 
reached in 2012. The total number of those insured under these two new schemes was 498 million at the 
end of 2013, including 138 million pensioners. Together with those covered under the existing schemes, 
the overall number of insured (including beneficiaries) amounted to 820 million, more than 80 per cent 
of the population over 18 years old. 

•  Both the new health and the new pension schemes are highly subsidized by the Government. For in-
stance, the annual fiscal contribution to health insurance for uninsured urban residents was raised from 
40 yuan renminbi (CNY) per person in 2007 (as against CNY60 for the insured) to CNY280 in 2013, and 
is planned to rise again to CNY320 for 2014. 

•  The level of pension paid under the urban workers’ pension system has been increased consecutively for 

ten years (2005–14) at an annual rate of 10 per cent to secure its purchasing power. 

•  The overall amount of social insurance benefits paid out in 2013 amounted to CNY2.8 trillion –a nearly 

threefold increase from its 2007 level – representing a major contribution to domestic-led growth. 

•  The minimum living standard guarantee programme has achieved the goal of universal coverage since 

2007, making an essential contribution to the reduction of poverty and inequality.

As a result of these and other initiatives, social security expenditure has grown constantly, contributing to 
increases in disposable income for millions of households and supporting China’s sustainable economic 
development.

Given the slowing rates of economic growth in 
many middle-income countries (IMF, 2013a) and the 
potentially detrimental effects of ill-designed fiscal con-
solidation policies, continued efforts are essential to 
strengthen social security systems and expand them 
in two dimensions: guaranteeing at least basic levels of 
social security to all through national social protection 
floors, and progressively reaching higher levels of social 

security that effectively prevent vulnerability and re-
spond to the social security needs of the middle classes, 
which are often neglected by conventional poverty re-
duction policies (e.g. Birdsall, 2010).

6.4.1   Against the odds: Extending social 
protection coverage in low-income 
countries

Low-income countries face stronger constraints in ex-
tending social protection coverage than middle- and 
high-income countries. Typically, they face higher 
levels of poverty and destitution that have to be ad-
dressed with fewer financial resources, through weaker 
institutional capacities and within often fragile con-
texts. Nonetheless, a number of low-income countries 
have also taken decisive steps towards the extension of 
social protection in various areas (see figure 6.6 above 
and table 6.4). Rwanda, for example, thoroughly re-
formed its health system in order to ensure effective 
access for more than 90 per cent of the population 
to health services and improved the quality of health 
services provided; this has contributed to a rapid de-
crease in maternal and child mortality (Sekabaraga 
et al., 2011). Bangladesh, Kenya and Malawi are among 
the countries that have introduced conditional cash 
transfer programmes, which contributed to enhancing 
income security and access to education for the tar-
geted vulnerable households in difficult contexts where 
public services and delivery capacities were sometimes 
too limited even to meet food security emergencies 
(García and Moore, 2012; Monchuk, 2014). In Nepal, 
the extension of social pension coverage has enhanced 
income security for older women and men. In Mozam-
bique, a large cash transfer programme has improved 
income security for vulnerable households, many of 
which include older persons and children (Cunha

et al., 2013). In Ethiopia, Malawi and Niger, among 
other countries, public employment programmes con-
tribute to enhancing income security for workers in 
rural areas during the lean season (McCord, 2012; 
Lieuw-Kie-Song, 2011). Although the coverage of 
some of these programmes is limited to certain geo-
graphic areas or narrowly defined groups of the popu-
lation, they constitute an important investment in the 
health, nutrition, education and productive capaci-
ties of the population, and have generated significant 
effects in reducing poverty and vulnerability and im-
proving living standards.

As a result of these efforts, many low-income coun-
tries have significantly increased the share of GDP that 
they invest in social protection (including health) (see 
figure 6.18). This reflects an important shift in develop-
ment priorities towards a stronger emphasis on human 
development. 

Poor households, including the working poor, face 
insecurity in countries that provide no basic guaran-
tee of income security and health care through social 
protection mechanisms. Many poor people work in 
the rural informal economy, where they depend largely 
on the income they can earn from selling their crops. 
From an economic perspective, the lack of social pro-
tection coverage leads to inefficient use of resources, 
forcing poor rural households to opt for low-risk, low-
return crops, to hold liquid but less productive assets, 
and/or to withdraw children from school in response 
to crises.19 The absence of insurance or other forms of 
protection can thus lead to chronic poverty, or to a situ-
ation in which people can easily fall back into poverty 
in the event of shocks and thus are not in a position 
to improve their situation in a sustainable manner. 
Social transfers can contribute to improving household 
income security by stabilizing and protecting consump-
tion, which in turn can facilitate investment (ILO, 
2010b).

In recent years, social protection policies have been 
actively promoted in low-income countries, in recog-
nition of their role in reducing chronic poverty and 
vulnerability, and in contributing to the attainment of 
economic and social development objectives. Empha-
sis has been placed on the role of social protection in 
enhancing nutrition, health and education outcomes, 
particularly for children, and in strengthening human 
resources and capabilities (see figures 6.23 and 6.24 
below). More recently, stress has also been placed on the 
economic role of social protection in stabilizing house-
hold consumption, boosting aggregate demand and 
stimulating local markets, particularly in remote areas. 
Simulations of cash transfers in Ethiopia and Kenya 
demonstrate that the aggregate real benefit to the local 
economy is significantly higher than the actual amount 
of the transfer itself (FAO, 2014; Taylor, Thome and 
Davis, 2013). For many low-income countries, a par-
ticular challenge remains in shifting spending from 
security to social protection: a recent IMF study on Af-
ghanistan found that there is a balance to be achieved 

between security and social spending in order to opti-
mize the chances of establishing and maintaining social 
peace (Aslam, Berkes and Fukač, 2013).

These developments have shifted perceptions of 
social protection policies in low-income countries away 
from the assumption that they represent a cost (often 
assumed to be unaffordable) to an understanding that 
they constitute an “investment in people” that is in fact 
indispensable for future development (Cichon et al., 
2006; ILO, 2008a; Monchuk, 2014). As a result of this 
shift, recent policies have placed a stronger emphasis on 
social and human development, with a focus on redu-
cing extreme poverty and promoting “pro-poor growth” 
(e.g. OECD, 2009a); some concentrated attention on 
targeted safety-net approaches, while others have gone 
further to promote inclusive growth (e.g. ILO, 2011a).
Integrated development policies are crucial to foster 
synergies between the provision of cash transfers, access 
to health and other social services, and public invest-
ment. For example, a number of French-speaking Af-
rican countries have implemented measures to ensure 
universal effective access to health care for children and 
young mothers. While these have had a notable impact, 
they could have been even more successful if they had 
been coupled with more effective measures to improve 
and scale up the supply, and improve the accessibility 
and quality, of health services. Such measures could in-
clude the strengthening of public health infrastructure 
through public employment programmes that also pro-
vide employment opportunities and strengthen income 
security for vulnerable populations.

6.4.2   Expanding social protection using 
proceeds from fiscal consolidation 
and adjustment measures 

The expansion of social protection in developing 
countries began well before the global financial and 
economic crisis, and then gathered pace as the crisis 
led to an acceleration of investments in social protec-
tion. This was possible in part because some countries 
had benefited from the recent boom in commodity 
prices; however, many developing countries financed 
expansion of social protection from the proceeds of ad-
justment measures such as the reduction of subsidies, 
increased taxes on consumption taxes, such as VAT, and 

19  See e.g. Barrientos, 2007; Barrientos, 2013; Morduch, 1995; Dercon, 2003; ILO, 2010b; ILO, 2013b; Social Protection Floor Advisory 
Group, 2011.

World Social Protection Report 2014/156. Expanding social protection: Key to crisis recovery, inclusive development and social justice

cost savings from reforms in the pension and social pro-
tection systems, as set out in section 6.2.2 above. The 
net welfare effects vary from country to country and 
have not yet been adequately studied.

During the food and fuel crisis, many developing 
countries increased subsidies or cut taxes on food and/
or fuel (IMF, 2008); however, more recently 78 develop-
ing countries started to reverse food and energy subsi-
dies, despite the lack of any clear indication that local 
food and energy prices had fallen or that any compen-
satory social protection floor had been successfully put 
in place. This trend was largely driven by the ortho-
dox logic that generalized subsidies can be ineffective 
and costly, and that replacing them with targeted safety 
nets can remove market distortions and support vulner-
able groups more cost-effectively (Coady et al., 2010). 
Thus the IMF standard strategy recommended reducing 
energy subsidies (IMF, 2013b), a policy which in prin-
ciple can have positive environmental impacts – one 
reason why UN agencies have supported this policy in 
countries such as Mozambique (see box 6.6).

There are, however, some important policy implica-
tions that must be taken into account when considering 
a focus on subsidy removal and benefits targeted on the 
poorest. 
•  While subsidies can be removed overnight, develop-
ing a social protection system takes a long time, par-
ticularly in countries where institutional capacity is 
limited. Thus there is a high risk that subsidies may 
be withdrawn and populations left unprotected, 
without compensation through adequate social 
protection mechanisms, so that food and energy 
become unaffordable for many households, in par-
ticular, but not only, the poorest ones. 

Box 6.6  Mozambique: Using a fuel subsidy 

to extend social protection 

In Mozambique, the Government has worked to-
gether  with  the  ILO,  the  IMF,  UNICEF,  other  UN 
agencies and the World Bank to reprioritize expendi-
ture and to ensure sufficient resources are available 
for the building of a national social protection floor. 
A joint ILO–IMF study (Cunha et al., 2013) concluded 
that progressively expanding a social protection floor 
did not present a threat to fiscal sustainability. The 
study recommended that the ill-targeted fuel sub-
sidy be replaced by a more effective social protection 
system. Revenues from the booming natural resource 
sector have the potential to widen the available fiscal 
space for such provision. The Government envisages 
making a budget allocation of around 0.8 per cent 
of GDP for the social protection floor over 2014–16.

147

•  Targeting the poor excludes other vulnerable house-
holds and may lead to poor developmental out-
comes. Designing a safety net for the poor alone 
may leave unprotected many non-wealthy house-
holds that benefited from subsidies. The removal of 
fuel subsidies and consequent increases in energy 
prices to unaffordable levels have sparked pro-
tests in many countries, e.g. Algeria, Cameroon, 
Chile, India, Indonesia, Kyrgyzstan, Mexico, Mo-
zambique, Nicaragua, Niger, Nigeria, Peru, Sudan 
and Uganda (Ortiz et al., 2013; Zaid et al., 2014). 
Recent studies, including some by the IMF, point 
out that income inequality is a gross obstacle to de-
velopment, especially while global recovery remains 
fragile and many developing countries are trying to 
develop their internal markets to encourage national 
demand. A safety net for the poorest is by no means 
a sufficient response to these challenges.

•  The large cost savings resulting from reductions in 
energy subsidies should allow countries to develop 
comprehensive social protection systems: fuel sub-
sidies are large, but new safety nets tend to be small 
in scope and cost. For example, in Ghana, the elimi-
nated fuel subsidy would have cost over US$1 bil-
lion  in  2013,  whereas  the  well-targeted  LEAP 
programme costs about US$20 million per year. 

•  Subsidy reforms are complex and their social im-
pacts need to be properly assessed, and discussed 
within the framework of national dialogue, so that 
the net welfare effects are understood and reforms 
are agreed before any subsidies are removed. 

6.4.3   Beyond safety nets: Towards national 

social protection floors

The extension of social protection programmes in low-
income countries has contributed greatly to accelerat-
ing social and economic development, and to progress 
towards the achievement of the MDGs (UN, 2013b). 
In addition, greater recognition is now given to the 
wider functions of social protection with regard to the 
realization of human rights, the containment of in-
equality and income insecurity, and the promotion of 
social cohesion. At the same time, low-income coun-
tries face certain specific constraints, including limited 
fiscal space, the unpredictability of external aid and 
weak institutional capacity, including with regard to 
tax systems. Economists often counsel governments 
in these countries to target social protection more 

148

narrowly as a way to reconcile poverty reduction with 
fiscal consolidation (Ravallion, 1999), a line of advice 
that has been particularly prevalent in the current re-
cession and slow growth period. As a result, social pro-
tection programmes are often implemented in the form 
of temporary, small-scale safety net programmes, often 
narrowly targeted and/or limited to certain geograph-
ical areas. Allocating scarce resources to respond to the 
social protection needs of the population in a context 
of widespread poverty is a challenge, particularly with 
regard to establishing eligibility criteria that are equit-
able and transparent, and protect the dignity of the 
intended beneficiaries. It is important to bear in mind 
that people who manage to climb out of poverty are at 
high risk of falling back into poverty. In rural Ethio-
pia, between 1999 and 2009, less than 40 per cent of 
those who escaped poverty managed to remain above 
the poverty line (Chronic Poverty Advisory Network, 
2014, p. 77). 

While programmes of the safety-net type initially 
offer social protection to those targeted, their effect-
iveness is often hampered by their lack of foundations 
in national legislation and of stable, reliable sources 
of funding. Few low-income countries provide rights-
based entitlements with clear definitions of eligibility 
criteria and type and level of benefits. Targeting social 
programmes on the extreme poor, excluding most of 
the poor and vulnerable households who are also in 
need of public assistance, is a politically difficult and 
administratively complicated enterprise. 

In  many  countries,  there  is  a  marked  cleavage 
between contributory and non-contributory schemes. 
Whereas social insurance schemes are often perceived 
as catering to the interests of the (often small) number 
of employees in the formal economy, non-contributory 
schemes (means tested or not) tend to be considered 
as part of poverty reduction policies. By better coord-
inating and combining contributory and non-contrib-
utory programmes, countries can find more effective 
ways not only to reduce poverty, but also to prevent 
impoverishment, keep those who escape poverty from 
falling back into it, and enhance economic security for 
the entire population. Comprehensive and well-coor-
dinated social protection systems are therefore a major 
component of an integrated policy package to address 
chronic and recurrent poverty.

Some low-income countries have made great strides 
in improving coordination of existing social protec-
tion programmes, bringing them under a common 
strategic framework owned by the Government and 
developed with the participation of key stakeholders, 

and strengthening national legal, institutional and 
fiscal frameworks, so as to render national social se-
curity systems more effective, efficient, equitable and 
sustainable. Such efforts reach beyond a narrow focus 
on (often fragmented) safety nets, and aim at building 
national social protection floors and social security sys-
tems (ILO, 2012a).

During times of crisis, it is important to scale up, 
rather than scale down, social investments, and narrowly 
targeted safety nets tend to represent a de facto reduc-
tion in coverage. Given the critical importance of sup-
porting households in times of hardship, and of raising 
people’s incomes in order to encourage socio-economic 
recovery, a strong case can be made for the progressive 
extension of universal transfers to (for example) families 
with children, older persons, persons with disabilities 
and other groups. Targeting social protection on the 
poorest and excluding vulnerable populations as a con-
scious decision in policy design is inconsistent with the 
United Nations Charter, the Millennium Declaration 
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (according 
to which everyone is entitled to minimum standards of 
living, including food, clothing, education and social se-
curity), and conventions that have been signed by virtu-
ally every government across the world (e.g. UN, 2008; 
Sepúlveda, 2014; Sepúlveda and Nyst, 2012). 

A progressive expansion of social security provi-
sion requires, among other things, a strengthening of 
legal frameworks and institutional capacities, as well 
as a sustainable resource base, which in many cases will 
be based on a combination of domestic and external 
sources. Robust tax policies and tax administration are 
essential for ensuring that governments can rely on a 
sustainable and equitable resource base for their eco-
nomic and social development policies. This is particu-
larly important in resource-rich countries, in order to 
ensure that the benefits of growth are equitably shared 
and serve the needs of their populations (OECD, 
2014a; Hujo and McClanahan, 2009; Hujo, 2012). 

An approach that focuses on nationally owned and 
rights-based solutions emphasizes the importance of 
effective national social protection policies that can 
support inclusive growth and sustainable social and 
economic development, and contribute to the real-
ization of human rights. In doing so, this approach 
reaches beyond external development aid and short-
term safety-net policies, and contributes to ensuring 
coherence between economic, employment and social 
policies within a strong and sustainable legal and insti-
tutional framework (Townsend, 2009; Behrendt et al., 
2009). Such dedicated and nationally owned efforts 

World Social Protection Report 2014/156. Expanding social protection: Key to crisis recovery, inclusive development and social justice

to strengthen institutional capacities have contributed 
to enhancing development outcomes, for example in 
Ethiopia and Rwanda. In other countries, particularly 
those considered as fragile States, these challenges may 
be even greater; however, social protection is among the 
policy areas that can potentially contribute to strength-
ening the “social contract”, fostering national dialogue 
and enhancing trust in the government and public in-
stitutions in general (e.g. Hickey, 2010). 

If governments and other national actors pursue 
these policies with commitment and in good faith, the 
establishment and strengthening of national social pro-
tection floors will not only have an immediate impact 
on people’s lives, but will also contribute to building 
more inclusive societies and economies in the longer 
term. 

6.5   Fiscal space for social protection floors

It is often argued that social protection is not af-
fordable  or  that  government  expenditure  cuts  are 
inevitable during adjustment periods. But there are al-
ternatives, even in the poorest countries. Finding fiscal 
space for critical economic and social investments is es-
sential if sustained and equitable development is to be 
achieved, particularly during a recession and periods of 
slow growth.

It is important to understand at the outset that gov-
ernments’ options in respect of revenue and spending 

vary widely across the globe. It is a matter of political 
choice (ILO, 2008a; Hall, 2010). Some countries opt 
to spend more or less, as part of their social contract, as 
shown in figure 6.19. As in spending decisions, there is 
a similar disparity in how governments raise resources 
for social and economic development. By utilizing all 
possible options to expand fiscal space and invest in 
their people, countries can achieve a virtuous circle of 
sustained growth and social development, and avoid 
the risk of a slow growth and weak human development 
trap (Ryder, 2013; ILO, 2012e). 

Today, the need to create and maintain fiscal space 
for socio-economic investments has never been greater. 
Given the significance of public investment in enhanc-
ing the prospects for equitable, inclusive economic 
growth and social development, it is critical that gov-
ernments explore options to increase social spending 
and employment-generating economic investments. 
Even the IMF Managing Director, recognizing the risk 
that fiscal consolidation may jeopardize global recov-
ery efforts, has called for “aggressive exploration of all 
possible measures that could be effective in supporting 
short-term growth” (Lagarde, 2011). 

There are options available to governments to expand 
fiscal space for a socially responsive recovery even in 
the poorest countries – options that are all supported 
by policy statements of the United Nations and inter-
national financial institutions (IMF and World Bank, 
2006; ILO, 2009a; ILO, 2011a; ILO, 2012a; OECD, 
2014a; UNDP, 2007; UN, 2009b; UN, 2013c). These

include: (1) reallocating public expenditures, (2) increas-
ing tax revenues, (3) extending social security contri-
butions, (4) borrowing or restructuring existing debt, 
(5) curtailing illicit financial flows, (6) drawing on in-
creased aid and transfers, (7) tapping into fiscal and 
foreign exchange reserves and/or (8) adopting a more 
accommodating macroeconomic framework (Hujo 
and McClanahan, 2009; Durán-Valverde and Pacheco, 
2012; Ortiz and Cummins, 2012). Normally a govern-
ment would carve out its own fiscal space from a few of 
these options. The uniqueness of each country requires 
that the range of options be carefully examined at the 
national level and the selection based on effective social 
dialogue and a sound approach to political economy 
(ILO, 2012a).

6.5.1   Option 1: Reallocating current  

public expenditures

This is the most orthodox option, which includes as-
sessing ongoing budget allocations, replacing high-cost, 
low-impact investments with those that can generate 
larger socio-economic impacts, eliminating spending 
inefficiencies and/or tackling corruption. Reprioritiza-
tion requires that governments be prepared to recon-
sider what areas of public policy require most support. 
For example, governments in Cambodia, Costa Rica, 
Mauritius and Sri Lanka have reduced expenditures in 
the defence and security sectors in favour of increased 
spending in social sectors. One area of expenditure 
with great potential in creating fiscal space is subsidies. 
Removing subsidies has allowed expansion of social 

150

Box 6.7  Financing social protection from subsidy removal 

Since 2010, 100 governments have been considering removing food and fuel subsidies and replacing them 
with safety nets targeted on the poor, including 31 countries in sub-Saharan Africa, 22 in HICs, 12 in East 
Asia and the Pacific, 11 in Latin America, nine in the Middle East and North Africa, and six in South Asia. 
The IMF’s standard policy advice is to phase out energy subsidies (IMF, 2013b), a course of action that in 
principle has positive environmental externalities. However, the quick removal of subsidies – a main element 
of fiscal consolidation in developing countries – has led to significant protests against the resulting in higher 
food and fuel prices (Ortiz et al., 2013). For example, in Nigeria, where the majority of the population lives 
on less than US$2 per day, cheap petrol is viewed by many as the only tangible benefit they receive from 
the State: hence the massive protests in 2012 when the Government removed a fuel subsidy that kept food 
and transportation costs low. 

There are three key lessons that Governments contemplating subsidy removal need to consider: (1) sub-
sidy reforms are complex; there is no “one-size-fits-all” option, and the net welfare effect of any reform it its 
national context must be properly understood and discussed in national dialogue. (2) designing a meagre 
safety net for the poorest alone is an insufficient compensation mechanism if other households were also 
benefiting from subsidies; the huge public savings reaped from cancelling energy subsidies should allow 
governments to consider adequate universal social protection systems and other necessary development 
policies that work for all citizens, not just for a few. (3) As food and energy prices hover near record highs, 
scaling back subsidies should be avoided unless a well-functioning social protection system is already in 
place that can protect households; such a system takes time to be developed, and if subsidies are with-
drawn overnight, populations will be left unprotected during a period of exceptional vulnerability, as shown 
by recent claims by civil society (Zaid et al., 2014).

Box 6.8  Taxing mineral and natural resource extraction to generate fiscal space for social protection
Taxing natural resource extraction offers great potential for many developing countries. While Norway’s ap-
proach of taxing oil profits and storing the revenues in the Government Pension Fund Global is perhaps the 
best-known case, developing countries offer several innovative examples of channelling natural resource 
revenue streams for social protection (Hujo, 2012; OECD, 2014a). For instance, Mongolia is financing a uni-
versal rights-based child benefit from taxation on copper exports. When copper prices dropped with falling 
demand in 2009, Mongolia was advised to target its universal child benefit; this it refused to do, when in 
2010/11 copper prices rise again. Given the volatile nature of primary commodity prices, many governments 
have created “stabilization funds” based on windfall taxes. Such funds allow governments to smooth their 
income and expenditure, saving the proceeds bonanza years for “rainy days” when prices of commodity 
exports may be low, and hence ensuring that investments in social and economic development remain 
constant. Examples include Chile’s Copper Stabilization Fund, Iran’s Oil Stabilization Fund and Papua New 
Guinea’s Mineral Resources Stabilization Fund. During the recent economic downturn, a number of countries 
have drawn on these funds to finance stimulus measures for national growth and increase social protection.

protection schemes in a number of countries, including 
Mozambique and Ghana, though the net welfare effect 
of any reform must be properly understood prior to re-
moving subsidies (box 6.7). 

6.5.2   Option 2: Increasing tax revenues

This may be achieved by altering various types of tax 
rates, by strengthening the efficiency of tax-collection 
methods, and by improving overall compliance. As 
noted above, 94 countries are already increasing con-
sumption taxes such as VAT, which are generally regres-
sive as they cover products that the poor consume. The 
focus should be shifted instead to other taxes, such as 
those on corporate profits, financial activities, personal 
income, property, imports or exports, which tend to be 
progressive. Progressive taxation – the principal redis-
tribution tool available to policy-makers – should be 
prioritized on grounds of both fiscal space and equity 
in order to enlist the political support of citizens and 
promote socio-economic recovery (IMF, 2010c; Ostry 
et al., 2014). 

6.5.3   Option 3: Extending social security 

contributions

Generating funding through social contributions is by 
its nature associated with the extension of contributory 
social security schemes. Many countries in recent years 
have increased social protection financing significantly 

by this means, including Brazil, China, Costa Rica, 
Lesotho, Namibia, South Africa and Thailand. In 
most countries, these initiatives are closely associated 
with the introduction of new measures to bring more 
workers into formal employment and to expand the 
coverage of contributory social security schemes. 

6.5.4   Option 4: Borrowing or restructuring 

existing debt

Some countries have potential capacity to borrow 
(through loans or bond issues); other already have large 
debts and need better debt management. Debt restruc-
turing is the process of reducing existing levels of debt 
or debt service charges. For those countries suffering 
from high levels of debt, restructuring existing debt 
may be possible and justifiable if the legitimacy of the 
debt is questionable (e.g. nationalized private sector 
debts) and/or the opportunity cost in terms of worsen-
ing growth and living standards is high (box 6.9). Five 
main options are available to governments seeking to 
restructure sovereign debt: (1) renegotiating debt (as 
more than 60 countries have done since the 1990s), 
(2) achieving debt relief/cancellation (e.g. under the 
Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative or HIPC, 
introduced in 1996), (3) entering into debt swaps/
conversions (as done by more than 50 countries since 
1980s), (4) repudiating debt (as Iraq and Iceland have 
done), or (5) defaulting (done by more than 20 coun-
tries since 1999, including Argentina and the Russian 
Federation). There is ample experience of governments 

151

Box 6.9  Ecuador: Using resources freed up  
by debt restructuring for social protection

Some developing countries have re-examined accumulated debts dating back to the 1970s in order to 
decrease their outstanding obligations. In 2008, Ecuador became the first country to hold an official audit 
to assess the legitimacy of its sovereign debt. The government-commissioned, two-year-long investigation 
concluded that some of its foreign debts (mostly private sector debts nationalized by former governments) 
had broken multiple principles of international and domestic law and were therefore “illegitimate”. While 
Ecuador respected all of the debt that had contributed to the country’s development – the so-called “legiti-
mate” debt – it defaulted on its alleged illegitimate debt in November 2008 and bought it back at 35 cents 
to the dollar just a few weeks later.

On the basis of the Ecuadorean (and also the Norwegian) experience, a special United Nations Com-
mission of Experts on Reforms of the International Monetary and Financial System came out in support 
of public debt audits as a mechanism for transparent and fair restructuring of debts (UN, 2009b). The 
public resources freed up in Ecuador by this method were invested in human development, which included 
doubling education spending between 2006 and 2009, nearly doubling housing assistance programmes for 
low-income families and expanding its main social protection programme, the cash transfer Bono de Desar-
rollo Humano (human development bond). The results are impressive: poverty fell from a recession peak 
of 36.0 per cent to 28.6 per cent, unemployment dropped from 9.1 per cent to 4.9 per cent and school 
enrolment rates rose significantly (Ray and Kozameh, 2012).

restructuring debt or reducing debt service payments, 
often against opposition from creditors. The IMF has 
proposed a Sovereign Debt Restructuring Mechanism 
(Kruger, 2002; IMF, 2003), and the United Nations 
has also called for a mechanism for the reduction of sov-
ereign debt that deals fairly with lenders and borrowers 
alike (UN, 2009b; UN, 2010b). 

6.5.5   Option 5: Curtailing illicit financial flows

Curtailing illicit financial flows (IFFs) also has the po-
tential to generate large amounts of additional resources 
for socio-economic investments, including social pro-
tection. IFFs involve capital that is illegally earned, 
transferred or used and include, inter alia, traded goods 
that are mispriced to avoid higher tariffs, wealth fun-
nelled to offshore accounts to evade income taxes and 
unreported movements of cash (UNDP, 2011). It is 
estimated that in 2009 US$1.3 trillion in IFFs moved 
out of developing countries, mostly through trade mis-
pricing, of which nearly two-thirds ended up in high-
income countries; this amounts to more than ten times 
the total amount of aid received by developing coun-
tries (figure 6.20).

6.5.6   Option 6: Drawing on increased aid  

and transfers

This requires either engaging with different donor gov-
ernments in order to increase North–South or South–
South transfers, or reducing South–North transfers, 
such as IFFs, which are significantly larger (see above). 
As a result of the fiscal consolidation policies adopted 
in most donor countries, development aid fell by 4 per 
cent in real terms in 2012, following a 2 per cent fall 
in 2011 (OECD, 2013e). In 2012, the United Nations 
Special Rapporteurs for the Right to Food, and for Ex-
treme Poverty and Human Rights, called for a global 
fund for social protection to redress the balance (De 
Schutter and Sepúlveda, 2012). 

6.5.7   Option 7: Using fiscal and central bank 

foreign exchange reserves

This includes drawing down fiscal savings and other 
state revenues stored in special funds, such as sovereign 
wealth funds, and/or using excess foreign exchange re-
serves in the central bank for domestic and regional 
development. A more detailed discussion of this option 
can be found in Ortiz and Cummins, 2012; here there 
is space only to highlight the case of sovereign wealth 
funds (SWFs), which can potentially be used for na-
tional socio-economic development and social protec-
tion. The logic behind SWFs – such as the Abu Dhabi 
Investment Authority, Norway’s Government Pension 
Fund Global, and Singapore’s Temasek Holdings and 
Government of Singapore Investment Corporation – is 
to maximize financial returns on investment, usually in 
international capital markets. While creating an SWF 
is an option available to most governments, many have 
questioned the logic of investing earned public income 
for capital market growth when those resources could 
be invested in social and economic goods and services 
urgently needed at home. The Bolivarian Republic of 
Venezuela, for example, has used its fiscal reserves to fi-
nance a number of development objectives both domes-
tically and regionally. On the other hand, Timor-Leste, 
a country with very low scores on human indicators of 
development and a high proportion of people living in 
poverty (50 per cent in 2007, up from 36 per cent in 
2001), has an estimated US$6.3 billion stored in an 
SWF investing overseas. The key point is that govern-
ments have multiple options in how to use their reserves 
for socio-economic development, and the alternatives 
should be carefully evaluated (see box 6.8). 

World Social Protection Report 2014/156. Expanding social protection: Key to crisis recovery, inclusive development and social justice

6.5.8   Option 8: Adopting a more accommodating 

macroeconomic framework

This entails allowing for higher budget deficits and 
higher levels of inflation without jeopardizing macro-
economic stability (e.g. through quantitative easing 
in the United States). The goals of macroeconomic 
policy are multiple, from supporting growth, price 
stabilization or inflation control to smoothing eco-
nomic cycles, reducing unemployment and poverty, 
and promoting equity. In recent decades, macroeco-
nomic frameworks have placed strong emphasis on 
short-term stabilization measures, such as controlling 
inflation and fiscal deficits, as part of broader efforts 
aimed at liberalizing economies, integrating them 
into global markets and attracting investment. While 
these macroeconomic objectives are not necessarily 
unsound, there is an increasing risk in many develop-
ing countries that other important objectives, such as 
employment-generating growth and social protection, 
lose priority and come to be underemphasized. It is 
important to underscore that there are diverse views 
on what constitutes an “acceptable” level of inflation 
or fiscal deficits, and that, as part of the crisis response, 
there has been a growing recognition of the need to 
ease budget constraints and allow for an increasing 
degree of deficit spending, especially to support so-
cially relevant investments and employment-generating 
economic growth (IMF, 2009; Epstein, 2009; Pollin, 
Epstein and Heintz, 2008; Islam and Chowdhury, 

2010a; Islam and Chowdhury, 2010b; UNCTAD, 
2011; UNCTAD, 2012; UNCTAD, 2013).

In summary, there are ample opportunities for 
countries to increase fiscal space for social protection 
through a combination of tailored strategies. Usually 
it is appropriate for governments to consider a mix of 
the different strategies, as in the examples presented in 
table 6.5. Each country is unique, and the full range of 
available fiscal space options should be carefully exam-
ined – with close attention to the potential risks and 
trade-offs associated with each opportunity – at the 
national level through an inclusive dialogue to ensure 
a socially responsive recovery. All of the fiscal space op-
tions described in this report are supported by policy 
statements of the United Nations and international 
financial institutions. ILO Recommendation No. 202 
emphasizes the responsibility of national governments 
in financing national social protection floors, and in 
mobilizing the necessary resources to ensure the finan-
cial, fiscal and economic sustainability of these arrange-
ments. The Recommendation also notes explicitly that 
national resource mobilization strategies may include 
the effective enforcement of tax and contribution ob-
ligations, reprioritizing expenditure, and/or a broader 
and sufficiently progressive revenue base. The Recom-
mendation further states that countries whose eco-
nomic and fiscal capacities are insufficient to implement 
the guarantees may seek international cooperation and 
support to complement their own efforts (Paras 11–12; 
see also ILO, 2012a).

6.6   Why social protection floors are key 

to recovery and must be part of  
the post-2015 development agenda 

As the global community struggles to emerge from re-
cession and slow growth, and assesses the current de-
velopment agenda and the progress made towards the 
achievement of the Millennium Development Goals, it 
is high time to recall the three main reasons why social 
protection is one of the necessary conditions for sus-
tainable development. First, it is a human right and a 
core element of labour rights. It is also a social and polit-
ical necessity, as States need a capacity to intervene where 
markets have failed; effective national social protection 
systems are powerful tools to provide income security, 
to prevent and reduce poverty and inequality and to 
build inclusive society; thus they strengthen social co-
hesion and contribute to establishing and maintaining 
social peace. Social protection is also an economic ne-
cessity to sustain domestic consumption and demand 
by raising household income. Adequate social protec-
tion enhances productivity and human development, 
 enables workers to adapt to change, and facilitates 
equitable and inclusive structural change. Investing in 
social protection is investing in a healthy, productive 
and equitable society. 

6.6.1   Social protection floors reduce  

poverty and inequalities

Social protection reduces poverty  
and social exclusion

Social protection is a crucial instrument in addressing 
all forms of poverty. Cash transfer schemes have suc-
cessfully reduced poverty in Africa, Asia, Central and 
Eastern Europe, and Latin America, potentially deliv-
ering much faster results than those expected from the 
“trickle-down” effects of economic policies. Although in 
practice benefits have tended to be lower than needed, 
a cash transfer at an adequate level can bring people out 
of poverty overnight. Equally importantly, cash trans-
fers have had even larger effects on reducing the depth 
of poverty. For example, South Africa’s non-contribu-
tory grants have reduced the poverty gap by more than 
one-third (Woolard, Harttgen and Klasen, 2010), the 
Oportunidades programme in Mexico has reduced the 
numbers living in poverty by 10 per cent and the pov-
erty gap by 30 per cent (Skoufias and Parker, 2001), 
and Kyrgyzstan’s Social Protection Programme has re-
duced the number of people living in extreme poverty 
by 24 per cent and the poverty gap among beneficiar-
ies by 42 per cent (World Bank, 2003). The expansion 
of food assistance in the United States is reported to 
have reduced the number of households in extreme pov-
erty by half (CBPP, 2014). Overall, social transfers and

Public social protection expenditure as % of GDP

Notes: R2 = 0.5326. The relationship between public social protection expenditure and poverty outcomes is complex, involving a variety of factors. 
It should be noted in particular that US$2 PPP per day does not represent a meaningful absolute poverty line in high-income countries; this cut-off 
point was selected for the purpose of the graph to ensure international comparability.

Public social protection expenditure as % of GDP

Notes:R2 = 0.3893. Again, the relationship between social protection policies (measured here by expenditure) and inequality (here measured by 
Gini coefficient) is much more complex than can be captured here. Well-designed social protection policies address not only income inequality, 
but also various other dimensions of inequality (see e.g. UNRISD, 2010; OECD, 2011b; UNDP, 2014).

taxation have reduced poverty by more than 50 per cent 
in most European countries (see figure 6.16 above). 

Social protection expenditure has a prominent role 
in reducing and preventing poverty, containing in-
equality and addressing social exclusion. Particularly 
crucial is its capacity to ensure that people can escape 
poverty for good: the risk of falling back into poverty is 
very high where effective social protection mechanisms 
do not exist (Chronic Poverty Advisory Network, 2014). 
Social protection is essential in addressing not only 
monetary poverty but also social exclusion (Babajanian 
and Hagen-Zanker, 2012). Indeed, social protection 
constitutes one of the essential channels through which 
governments can distribute and redistribute income and 
resources, and share the benefits of growth, reinforcing 
the democratic mandates granted them on election to 
fulfil societal expectations. The key role of social pro-
tection in inclusive growth is now widely recognized 
(e.g. OECD, 2009a). It is therefore not surprising that 
higher levels of social protection expenditure are associ-
ated with lower levels of poverty (see figure 6.21).

Social protection reduces income inequality

The role of social protection reaches far beyond a mere 
reduction of income poverty. While debate has for 
some time focused narrowly on poverty reduction and 

the efficiency of targeting, it is increasingly acknow-
ledged that the reduction of poverty is not sufficient to 
promote inclusive growth (UNDP, 2013; UN, 2013d; 
UN, 2013e). Broader social protection policies encom-
passing approaches such as extending social insurance 
are needed to help prevent poverty and insecurity and 
to contain inequality (figure 6.22). The correlation 
between public social protection expenditure and in-
equality (as expressed by the Gini coefficient) is less 
strong than for poverty, but there is still a distinct re-
lationship, suggesting that higher levels of social pro-
tection expenditure are associated with lower levels of 
inequality. 

Social protection contributes to human capital 
development, reduces hunger and contributes 
to food security

There is strong evidence of the positive impacts of 
social protection on hunger and nutrition. In Africa, 
Asia and Latin America, cash transfers have been 
shown to improve both the quantity and the diversity 
of food consumption, and to protect food consump-
tion during shocks or lean periods. Better nutrition 
also contributes to better physical development: pro-
grammes in Mexico, Malawi, and Colombia all dem-
onstrate reductions in the numbers of children with 

156

stunted growth (Yablonski and O’Donnell, 2009; 
Tirivayi, Knowles and Davis, 2013), while children in 
South African households receiving a pension grow on 
average 5 centimetres taller than those in households 
without a pension (Case, 2001). 

on the usefulness of broader social protection interven-
tions in HIV and AIDS prevention, treatment, and 
care and support (ILO, 2008b; Temin, 2010). Cash 
transfers, for example, were found effective in support-
ing families to care for people living with HIV/AIDS 
and in improving access to treatment and adherence.

Social protection supports positive 
education outcomes

Social protection programmes, including cash trans-
fers, the supply of free tuition and materials, and school 
feeding programmes, have all been shown to lead to 
higher school enrolment rates, fewer school dropouts 
and less child labour by removing demand-side barri-
ers to education, including the need for poor families 
to rely on children for income-earning and care work. 
Transfer programmes in Bangladesh, Brazil, Cambo-
dia, Ecuador, Ethiopia, Malawi, Mexico, Nicaragua, 
Pakistan, South Africa, and Turkey have all demon-
strated significant increases in children’s school enrol-
ment and/or attendance (Adato and Bassett, 2008). 

Social protection supports positive 
health outcomes

Social protection can contribute to better and more 
equal health outcomes in various ways. Investments in 
health infrastructure, staff and drugs are most urgently 
needed where the burden of illness is heaviest. Finan-
cial support is also needed to prevent families falling 
into poverty because of heavy out-of-pocket health ex-
penditures. A WHO cross-country study showed this 
can be done by reducing the health system’s reliance 
on OOP and providing more financial risk protection 
(Xu, Evans and Kawabata, 2003). Thailand’s commit-
ment to achieving universal access to health care led 
to significant improvements in health outcomes on a 
number of measures, including take-up of services and 
the rate of health-related impoverishment (Evans et al., 
2012; Tangcharoensathien et al., 2009). The Oportu-
nidades programme in Mexico combined cash trans-
fers and free health services with improvements in the 
supply of health services, leading to a 17 per cent de-
cline in rural infant mortality over a three-year period 
and an 11 per cent reduction in maternal mortality 
rates (Barham, 2010; Adato and Bassett, 2008). In 
Ghana, user fee exemptions for pregnant women led to 
a significant reduction in the maternal mortality rate 
(Witter et al., 2007). More recently, there is evidence 

6.6.2   Social protection floors promote decent 

employment and inclusive growth

Social protection promotes employment

Social protection plays a major role in creating access 
to full and productive employment and decent work 
for all, including women and young people, through 
cash transfers, active labour market measures, health 
insurance and family support policies. These have 
been shown to encourage labour market participation 
in low- and middle-income countries by guaranteeing 
public work opportunities, covering the costs of job-
seeking and supporting those with childcare responsi-
bilities – with particularly strong effects for women. In 
South Africa, labour market participation among those 
receiving cash transfers was 13–17 per cent higher than 
in similar non-recipient households, with the greatest 
difference among women (Economic Policy Research 
Institute, 2004). For young people who are structur-
ally unemployed or at high social risk, the Joven pro-
gramme in Chile combines work experience, training 
and apprenticeships; this model has been replicated in 
other South American countries (World Bank, 2003). 
In other countries, such as India and Uganda, cash 
transfers have been used to provide employment for 
local youth and poor people. Cash transfers can also 
provide critical resources for funding job search, sup-
porting quality training and skills development, in-
creasing access to credit and bolstering the resilience of 
agricultural smallholders in maintaining production. 
Public employment programmes can also be linked to 
green jobs and environmental improvements, as for 
example in Brazil and the Philippines. A recent study 
from the United States indicates that giving food as-
sistance to the children of poor families increases their 
average annual earnings in the long run by as much as 
US$3,000, and their average number of hours of work 
by 150 annually (CBPP, 2014).

Many countries in Asia, Africa and Latin Amer-
ica have developed ways of coordinating social pro-
tection mechanisms with labour market policies and 
services, thereby strengthening opportunities for the 

World Social Protection Report 2014/156. Expanding social protection: Key to crisis recovery, inclusive development and social justice

unemployed to return to the market. One particu-
larly interesting finding is that adult participants in 
a number of the Latin American cash transfer pro-
grammes mentioned above, as well as beneficiaries of 
similar schemes in South Africa, were able to increase 
their rate of economic activity, finding their employ-
ability boosted through simple investments in and 
access to training and employment services, and to 
look for work more effectively with the costs of job 
searching boosted through the modest cash transfers 
received by families.

Social protection promotes economic growth

Social protection schemes contribute to sustainable eco-
nomic growth by raising labour productivity and em-
powering people to find decent jobs. Injecting money 
into rural communities can have important multi-
plier effects on the local economy, stimulating trade 
in goods and services and encouraging more dynamic 
local development based on both agricultural and off-
farm activities (Tirivayi, Knowles and Davis, 2013; 
Alderman and Yemtsov, 2012). Social protection rep-
resents an investment in a country’s “human infrastruc-
ture” no less important than investments in its physical 

infrastructure. Only a population that is healthy, well 
nourished and well educated can realize its potential 
for productive employment. The positive impacts of 
cash transfers on children’s nutrition, and on access to 
health and education, have been well recorded around 
the world. Well-designed social protection systems thus 
enable a country to unlock its full productive potential 
and to promote inclusive growth (ILO, 2014d).

There are multiple channels through which social 
protection systems can support such investments in 
people (see ILO, 2010b; Social Protection Floor Ad-
visory Group, 2011; Behrendt, 2013), with beneficial 
effects in both the short and the longer term. In the 
short term, social protection can help to improve the 
health of the population, stabilize aggregate consump-
tion, enable people to take more risky decisions and to 
engage in more productive economic activities, preserve 
and promote human capital and enhance the function-
ing of the labour market (see figure 6.23). It thereby 
contributes to supporting structural changes in the 
labour market and the economy, and also exercises its 
much-needed counter-cyclical function in economic 
downturns, such as that caused by the recent global 
crisis.

In the longer term, the effects of better access to 
food, better nutritional status and better health will

contribute to the better physical and mental develop-
ment of the population. The effects of enhancing access 
to education and improving educational performance 
also contribute to fostering a more productive and 
more readily employable workforce, which is one of the 
preconditions of sustained and inclusive growth (see 
figure 6.24).

The crisis has triggered a shift in the way the inter-
national community sees the relationship between 
growth, public intervention and social protection. In 
Asia and the Pacific, for example, policy-makers are 
increasingly moving away from export-led growth ap-
proaches alone towards more inclusive employment-
intensive recovery strategies which emphasize the need 
to reduce high domestic savings rates and improve the 
region’s underdeveloped social protection programmes 
(Ortiz and Cummins, 2013). China is a good example, 
having massively expanded social protection schemes in 
recent years to raise national living standards and pro-
mote national demand. 

In Africa and elsewhere, the food price crisis high-
lighted the limitations of family- and community-based 
traditional support systems in responding to aggregate 
shocks and spurred efforts to strengthen local agri-
culture. At the global level, there is now an awareness 
of the need to raise household incomes, expand internal 

markets and prepare better for future shocks by build-
ing up stronger systems during the current crisis recov-
ery period.

Social protection supports social peace, 
political stability and state-building

Social protection is not only a human right; it is also 
a social and political necessity. There can be no inclu-
sive and cohesive society where the poor and rich drift 
further and further apart. While the sources of polit-
ical conflict vary from one country to another, con-
flict generally originates in severe social grievances, 
often rooted in the perception of inequality among 
social, ethnic, religious or other groups. Social protec-
tion measures have a central role to play in easing and 
preventing such sources of conflict. Governments that 
have introduced and maintained strong social security 
systems have not only significantly reduced inequality, 
but also earned the trust of their citizens by providing 
them with reliable benefits and quality services, de-
livered by efficient and trustworthy institutions (e.g. 
GIZ, 2012). Social protection thus plays a key role in 
state building, institution building and fostering social 
peace and social justice. 

World Social Protection Report 2014/156. Expanding social protection: Key to crisis recovery, inclusive development and social justice

6.6.3   Leaving no one behind: Social protection 

floors to change people’s lives by 2030 

Social protection works. This is a key conclusion 
from this World Social Protection Report. The exten-
sion of social protection in many developing coun-
tries in recent years has successfully realized the right 
to social security for larger proportions of the popu-
lation. More children and families receive cash bene-
fits to enhance their income security, and these greatly 
facilitate access to nutrition, health and education. 
More older women and men can now rely on a regular 
source of income from a pension, even if levels are still 
modest. More people, especially those in rural areas, 
are benefiting from having the right to guaranteed 
employment for a certain number of days during lean 
seasons, and thus enhanced income security round the 
year. More children and adults have access to health 
services because governments have extended health 
insurance coverage and subsidized contributions for 
those who would not be able to afford them other-
wise, and have improved the quality and accessibility 
of public health services. These significant investments 
in social protection also enable workers to engage 
in  more  productive  employment,  and  strengthen 

aggregate consumption. A social protection benefit 
can make an enormous difference in the life of a single 
person, and of an entire country.

Despite these positive efforts, 73 per cent of the 
global working-age population, and their families, are 
still not sufficiently covered in comprehensive social 
security systems. More efforts are needed to acceler-
ate the extension of social security to adequate levels. 
Governments, with the participation of social partners 
and other stakeholders, have a responsibility to fill the 
remaining gaps in social protection and to progres-
sively ensure adequate levels of social security for their 
populations. Social protection floors address the daily 
concerns of families and households, and are linked to 
the realization of all people’s rights – those of children, 
of women and men of working age, of persons with 
disabilities, of older persons. Rio+20’s The Future We 
Want recognized “the need to provide social protection 
to all members of society, fostering growth, resilience, 
social justice and cohesion” and encouraged “initiatives 
aimed at providing social protection floors for all citi-
zens” (UN, 2012a, p. 29). Looking beyond 2015, it 
is essential that social protection floors and social se-
curity systems be included among the new  Sustainable 
Development Goals.

Annex I
Glossary

161161

This glossary focuses on the basic concepts, defin-

itions and methodology guiding the analytical work 
of the ILO on social security or social protection.1 It 
does not set out to assert any universal definitions; its 
purpose is rather simply to clarify terms and concepts as 
they are used in this report and in the ILO. 

Cash  transfer  programme.  Non-contributory 
scheme or programme providing cash benefits to indi-
viduals or households, usually financed out of taxation, 
other government revenue, or external grants or loans. 
Cash transfer programmes2 may or may not include a 
means test.

Cash transfer programmes that provide cash to fam-
ilies subject to the condition that they fulfil specific 
behavioural requirements are referred to as conditional 
cash transfer programmes (CCTs). This may mean, for 
example, that beneficiaries must ensure their children 
attend school regularly, or that they utilize basic preven-
tative nutrition and health-care services. 

Contributory scheme.  Scheme in which contribu-
tions made by protected persons directly determine 
entitlement to benefits (acquired rights). The most 
common form of contributory social security schemes 
is a statutory social insurance scheme, usually cover-
ing workers in formal wage employment and, in some 

countries, the self-employed. Other common types of 
contributory schemes, providing – in the absence of 
social insurance – a certain level of protection include 
national provident funds, which usually pay a lump sum 
to beneficiaries when particular contingencies occur 
(typically old age, invalidity or death). In the case of 
social insurance schemes for those in waged or salaried 
employment, contributions are usually paid by both 
employees and employers (though in general, employ-
ment injury schemes are fully financed by employers). 
Contributory schemes can be wholly financed through 
contributions, but often are partly financed from tax-
ation or other sources; this may be done through a sub-
sidy to cover the deficit, or through a general subsidy 
supplanting contributions altogether, or by subsidiz-
ing only specific groups of contributors or beneficiaries 
(e.g. those not contributing because they are caring for 
children, studying, in military service or unemployed, 
or have too low a level of income to fully contribute, or 
receive benefits below a certain threshold because of low 
contributions in the past).

Employment guarantee scheme.  Public employ-
ment programme which provides a guaranteed number 
of workdays a year to poor households, generally pro-
viding wages at a relatively low level (typically at the 
minimum wage level if this is adequately defined). 

1  The glossary largely draws on the definitions, concepts and methods provided in the first edition of the World Social Security Report (ILO, 
2010a), with a number of important updates to reflect the provisions of the Social Protection Floors Recommendation, 2012 (No. 202), and 
other recent developments.
2  Strictly speaking, this term would encompass all social transfers provided in cash, including fully or partially contributory transfers, yet it 
is usually understood as limited to non-contributory transfers.

162

Means-tested scheme.  A scheme that provides bene-
fits upon proof of need and targets certain categories of 
persons or households whose means fall below a certain 
threshold, often referred to as social assistance schemes. 
A means test is used to assess whether the individual’s 
or household’s own resources (income and/or assets) 
are below a defined threshold and determine whether 
the applicants are eligible for a benefit at all, and if so at 
what level benefit will be provided. In some countries, 
proxy means tests are used: that is, eligibility is deter-
mined without actually assessing income or assets, on 
the basis of other household characteristics (proxies) 
that are deemed more easily observable. Means-tested 
schemes may also include entitlement conditions and 
obligations, such as work requirements, participation 
in health checkups or (for children) school attendance. 
Some means-tested schemes also include other inter-
ventions that are delivered on top of the actual income 
transfer itself. 

Non-contributory  schemes.  Non-contributory 
schemes, including non-means-tested and means-tested 
schemes, normally require no direct contribution from 
beneficiaries or their employers as a condition of en-
titlement to receive relevant benefits. The term covers 
a broad range of schemes, including universal schemes 
for all residents (such as a national health services), cat-
egorical schemes for certain broad groups of the popu-
lation (e.g. for children below a certain age or older 
persons above a certain age), and means-tested schemes 
(such as social assistance schemes). Non-contributory 
schemes are usually financed through taxes or other 
state revenues, or, in certain cases, through external 
grants or loans. 

Public employment programme.  Government pro-
gramme offering employment opportunities to cer-
tain categories of persons who are unable to find other 
employment. Public employment programmes include 
employment guarantee schemes and “cash for work” 
and “food for work” programmes (see box 3.2). 

Social assistance scheme/programme.  A scheme 
that provides benefits to vulnerable groups of the 
 population, especially households living in poverty. 
Most social assistance schemes are means-tested. 

Social insurance scheme.  Contributory social pro-
tection scheme that guarantees protection through 
an insurance mechanism, based on: (1) the prior pay-
ment of contributions, i.e. before the occurrence of the 

insured contingency; (2) risk- sharing or “pooling”; and 
(3) the notion of a guarantee. The contributions paid 
by (or for) insured persons are pooled together and the 
resulting fund is used to cover the expenses incurred ex-
clusively by those persons affected by the occurrence of 
the relevant (clearly defined) contingency or contingen-
cies. Contrary to commercial insurance, risk-pooling in 
social insurance is based on the principle of solidarity as 
opposed to individually calculated risk premiums. 

Many  contributory  social  security  schemes  are 
presented and described as “insurance” schemes (usu-
ally “social insurance schemes”), despite being in actual 
fact of mixed character, with some non-contributory 
elements in entitlements to benefits; this allows for a 
more equitable distribution of benefits, particularly for 
those with low incomes and short or broken work car-
eers, among others. These non-contributory elements 
take various forms, being financed either by other con-
tributors (redistribution within the scheme) or by the 
State. 

Social protection.  The term “social protection” is 
used in institutions across the world with a wider var-
iety of meanings than “social security”. It is often in-
terpreted as having a broader character than social 
security (including, in particular, protection provided 
between members of the family or members of a local 
community), but it is also used in some contexts with 
a narrower meaning (understood as comprising only 
measures addressed to the poorest, most vulnerable or 
excluded members of society). Thus, in many contexts 
the two terms, “social security” and “social protection”, 
may be largely interchangeable, and the ILO certainly 
uses both in discourse with its constituents and in the 
provision of relevant advice to them. In this report, ref-
erence is made to “social protection” both as an alterna-
tive expression for “social security” and to denote the 
protection provided by social security in case of social 
risks and needs.

Social  protection  floor.  ILO Recommendation 
No. 202 sets out that member States should establish 
and maintain national social protection floors as a na-
tionally defined set of basic social security guarantees 
which secure protection aimed at preventing or allevi-
ating poverty, vulnerability and social exclusion (ILO, 
2012a). These guarantees should ensure at a minimum 
that, over the life cycle, all in need have access to at least 
essential health care and basic income security. These 
together ensure effective access to essential goods and 
services defined as necessary at the national level. More 

World Social Protection Report 2014/15specifically, national social protection floors should 
comprise at least the following four social security guar-
antees, as defined at the national level:

(a)  access to essential health care, including mater-

nity care;

(b) basic income security for children, providing 
access to nutrition, education, care and any 
other necessary goods and services;

(c)  basic income security for persons in active age 
who are unable to earn sufficient income, in 
particular in cases of sickness, unemployment, 
maternity and disability; and

(d) basic income security for older persons.3

Such guarantees should be provided to all residents and 
all children, as defined in national laws and regulations, 
and subject to existing international obligations.

Recommendation No. 202 also states that basic 
social security guarantees should be established by law. 
National laws and regulations should specify the range, 
qualifying conditions and levels of the benefits giving 
effect to these guarantees, and provide for effective and 
accessible complaint and appeal procedures. 

Social protection floors correspond in many ways 
to the existing notion of “core obligations”, to ensure 
the realization of, at the very least, minimum essen-
tial levels of rights embodied in human rights treaties 
(OHCHR, 2013). 

Social  protection  programme/scheme  (social 
 security programme/scheme).  Distinct framework 
of rules to provide social protection benefits to entitled 
beneficiaries. Such rules would specify the geographical 
and personal scope of the programme (target group), 
entitlement conditions, the type of benefits, benefit 
amounts (cash transfers), periodicity and other benefit 
characteristics, as well as the financing (contributions, 
general taxation, other sources), governance and admin-
istration of the programme. 

While “programme” may refer to a wide range of 
programmes, the term “scheme” is usually used in a 
more specific sense referring to a programme that is 

Annex I. Glossary

anchored in national legislation and characterized by at 
least a certain degree of “formality”.

A programme/scheme can be supported by one or 
more social security institutions governing the provi-
sion of benefits and their financing. It should, in gen-
eral, be possible to draw up a separate account of receipts 
and expenditure for each social protection programme. 
It is often the case that a social protection programme 
provides protection against a single risk or need, and 
covers a single specific group of beneficiaries. Typically, 
however, one institution will administer more than one 
benefit programme.

Social  security.  The fundamental right to social 
security is set out in the Universal Declaration on 
Human Rights (1948) and other international legal in-
struments. The notion of social security adopted here 
covers all measures providing benefits, whether in cash 
or in kind, to secure protection, inter alia, from 
• 

lack of work-related income (or insufficient income) 
caused by sickness, disability, maternity, employ-
ment injury, unemployment, old age, or death of a 
family member; 
lack of (affordable) access to health care;
insufficient family support, particularly for children 
and adult dependants;

• 
• 

•  general poverty and social exclusion.

Social security thus has two main (functional) dimen-
sions, namely “income security” and “availability of 
medical care”, reflected in the Declaration of Philadel-
phia (1944), which forms part of the ILO’s Constitu-
tion: “social security measures to provide a basic income 
to all in need of such protection and comprehensive 
medical care” (III(f)).4 Recommendation No. 202 sets 
out that, at least, access to essential health care and 
basic income security over the life cycle should be guar-
anteed as part of nationally defined social protection 
floors, and that higher levels of protection should be 
progressively achieved by national social security sys-
tems in line with Convention No. 102 and other ILO 
instruments.

4  These two main dimensions are also identified in the ILO Income Security Recommendation, 1944 (No. 67), and the Medical Care 
Recommendation, 1944 (No. 69), respectively, as “essential element[s] of social security”. These Recommendations envisage that, first, 
“income security schemes should relieve want and prevent destitution by restoring, up to a reasonable level, income which is lost by reason 
of inability to work (including old age) or to obtain remunerative work or by reason of the death of a breadwinner” (Recommendation 
No. 67, Guiding principles, Para. 1); and, second, that “a medical care service should meet the need of the individual for care by members of 
the medical and allied professions” and “the medical care service should cover all members of the community” (Recommendation No. 69, 
Paras 1 and 8). Recommendation No. 202 also reflects these two elements in the basic social protection guarantees that should form part of 
national social protection floors (for more detail, see box 1.1).

Access to social security is essentially a public respon-
sibility, and is typically provided through public insti-
tutions, financed from either contributions or taxes or 
both. However, the delivery of social security can be and 
often is mandated to private entities. Moreover, there 
exist many privately run institutions (of an insurance, 
self-help, community-based or mutual character) which 
can partially assume selected roles usually played by social 
security, such as the operation of occupational pension 
schemes, that complement and may largely substitute for 
elements of public social security schemes. Entitlements 
to social security are conditional either on the payment 
of social security contributions for prescribed periods 
(contributory schemes, most often structured as social 
insurance arrangements) or on a requirement, some-
times described as “residency plus”, under which bene-
fits are provided to all residents of the country who also 
meet certain other criteria (non-contributory schemes). 
Such criteria may make benefit entitlements conditional 
on age, health, labour market participation, income or 
other determinants of social or economic status and/or 
even conformity with certain behavioural requirements. 
Two main features distinguish social security from 
other social arrangements. First, benefits are provided 
to beneficiaries without any simultaneous reciprocal ob-
ligation (thus it does not, for example, represent remu-
neration for work or other services delivered). Second, 
it is not based on an individual agreement between the 
protected person and the provider (as is, for example, 
a life insurance contract); the agreement applies to a 
wider group of people and so has a collective character. 
Depending on the category of applicable conditions, 
a distinction is also made between non-means-tested 
schemes (where the conditions of benefit entitlement 
are not related to the total level of income or wealth of 
the beneficiary and her or his family) and means-tested 
schemes (where entitlement is granted only to those 
with income or wealth below a prescribed threshold). 
A special category of “conditional” schemes includes 
those which, in addition to other conditions, require 
beneficiaries (and/or their relatives or families) to par-
ticipate in prescribed public programmes (for example, 
specified health or educational programmes). 

Social security system/social protection system. 
 Totality of social security/protection schemes and pro-
grammes in a country, taking into account that the latter 
term is often used in a broader sense than the former. 

All the social security schemes and institutions in a 
country are inevitably interlinked and complementary 

in their objectives, functions and financing, and thus 
form a national social security system. For reasons of 
effectiveness and efficiency, it is essential that there is 
close coordination within the system, and that – not 
least for coordination and planning purposes – the 
receipts and expenditure accounts of all the schemes 
are compiled into one social security budget for the 
country so that its future expenditure and financing of 
the schemes comprising the social security system are 
planned in an integrated way. 

Social transfer.  All social security benefits comprise 
transfers, either in cash or in kind: i.e. they represent 
a transfer of income, goods or services (e.g. health-
care services). This transfer may be from the active to 
the old, the healthy to the sick, or the affluent to the 
poor, among others. The recipients of such transfers 
may be in a position to receive them from a specific 
social security scheme because they have contributed 
to such a scheme (contributory scheme), or because 
they are residents (universal schemes for all residents), 
or because they fulfil specific age criteria (categorical 
schemes), or specific resource conditions (social assis-
tance schemes), or because they fulfil several of these 
conditions at the same time. In addition, it is a require-
ment in some schemes (employment guarantee schemes, 
public employment programmes) that beneficiaries ac-
complish specific tasks or (conditional cash transfer 
programmes) adopt specific behaviours. In any given 
country, several schemes of different types generally co-
exist and may provide benefits for similar contingencies 
to different population groups. 

Targeted scheme/programme.  See social assistance 
scheme.

Universal scheme/categorical scheme.  Strictly 
speaking, universal schemes provide benefits under the 
single condition of residence. However, the term is also 
often used to describe categorical schemes that provide 
benefits to certain broad categories of the population 
without a means-test. The most frequent forms of those 
schemes are those that transfer income to older per-
sons above a certain age or children below a certain age. 
Some categorical schemes also target households with 
specific structures (one-parent households, for example) 
or occupational groups (such as rural workers). In some 
schemes, entitlement to benefits may be conditional on 
performing or accomplishing certain tasks. Most cat-
egorical schemes are tax-financed.

Measuring social  
security coverage 

Measuring social security coverage is a complex task. 

Several dimensions need to be considered in order 
to arrive at a complete assessment. In practice, few 
countries have available the full range of statistical data 
necessary for a complete assessment of social security 
coverage; nevertheless, partial information is available 
for a large number of countries. Many countries have 
acknowledged the need to undertake better regular 
monitoring of social security coverage and are stepping 
up their efforts to improve data collection and analysis.
Social security coverage is a multidimensional con-

cept with at least three dimensions: 
•  Scope.  This is measured here by the range (number) 
and type of social security areas (branches) to which 
the population of the country has access. Population 
groups with differing status in the labour market 
may enjoy different scopes of coverage, and this 
factor must be taken into account in assessing scope.
•  Extent.  This usually refers to the percentage of per-
sons covered within the whole population or the 
target group (as defined by e.g. gender, age or labour 
market status) by social security measures in each 
specific area.

•  Level.  This refers to the adequacy of coverage by a 
specific branch of social security. It may be meas-
ured by the level of cash benefits provided, where 
measurements of benefit levels can be either abso-
lute or relative to selected benchmark values such as 

previous incomes, average incomes, the poverty line, 
and so on. Measures of quality are usually relative 
and may be objective or subjective – for example, 
the satisfaction of beneficiaries measured against 
their expectations.

165165

In measuring coverage, a distinction is made between 
legal coverage1 and effective coverage in each of the 
above three dimensions, and for each social security 
area. Effective coverage is usually different from legal 
coverage; it is often lower, largely due to various govern-
ance problems in implementing the legal provisions and 
also to gaps in funding. Table AII.1 summarizes these 
various dimensions of coverage.

Legal coverage

Estimates of the scope of legal coverage usually meas-
ure the number of social security areas (branches) by 
which – according to existing national legislation – a 
population or its specific groups is covered. The list of 
the nine branches covered by ILO Convention No. 102 
is used as guidance.

Estimates of the extent of legal coverage use both in-
formation on the groups covered by statutory schemes 
for a given social security area (branch) in national 
legislation, and available statistical information quanti-
fying the number of persons concerned at the national 

1  Legal coverage is sometimes referred to as “statutory coverage”, taking into account that provisions may be rooted in statutory provisions 
other than laws.

contributory benefits.

level. A population group can be identified as legally 
covered in a specific social security area (e.g. old age, 
unemployment protection, maternity protection) if the 
existing legislation sets out that this group is mandato-
rily covered by social insurance; or that this group will 
be entitled to specified non-contributory benefits under 
certain circumstances – for instance, to an old-age state 
pension on reaching the age of 65, or to income support 
if income falls below a specified threshold. A legal cover-
age ratio for a given branch of social security is the ratio 
between the estimated number of people legally covered 
and – as appropriate – the total population or labour 
force in the relevant age bracket, the total number of 
employees (that is, waged and salaried workers) or the 
total number of employed persons (including employees 
and the self-employed). For example, since Convention 
No. 102 allows a ratifying country to provide coverage 
through social insurance, through universal or means-
tested benefits, or a combination of both, it also for-
mulates alternatives to minimum requirements for the 
extent of coverage, as follows: (a) prescribed classes of 
employees, constituting not less than 50 per cent of all 
employees; or (b) prescribed classes of the economically 
active population, constituting not less than 20 per cent 

of all residents; or (c) all residents whose means during 
the contingency do not exceed prescribed limits.

The level of legal coverage for specific branches of 
social security is usually measured (for cash benefits) by 
benefit ratios or replacement ratios calculated for speci-
fied categories of beneficiaries, using benefit formulas 
or benefit amounts specified in the legislation. For ex-
ample, Convention No. 102 sets minimum replacement 
rates for cash benefits in seven of its nine branches (see 
tables in Annex III below). It specifies that such min-
imum rates should apply to a defined “standard” benefi-
ciary meeting qualifying conditions, and be guaranteed 
at least to those with earnings up to a certain prescribed 
selected level.

Effective coverage

Measurements of effective coverage should reflect how 
in reality the legal provisions are implemented. Effective 
coverage is usually different from legal coverage (and 
usually lower) because of non-compliance, problems 
with enforcement of legal provisions or other deviations 
of actual policies from the text of the legislation. In 

World Social Protection Report 2014/15Annex II. Measuring social security coverage 

167

order to arrive at a full coverage assessment, measures of 
legal and effective coverage need to be used in parallel.
Measurements of the scope of effective coverage in 
a country reveal the number of social security areas 
(branches) for which there is relevant legislation that is 
actually enforced: that is, whether in all such areas the 
majority of the population legally covered is also effect-
ively covered (as measured by the extent of effective cov-
erage; see below).

When measuring the extent of effective coverage a 
distinction has to be made between coverage measured 
in terms of protected persons and in terms of actual bene-
ficiaries. Protected persons are those who have benefits 
guaranteed but are not necessarily currently receiving 
them – for example, people who actively contribute to 
social insurance and are thus guaranteed benefits for a 
specified contingency, e.g. an old-age pension on reach-
ing retirement age or people entitled to non-contribu-
tory benefits if needed.

In respect of protected persons, the contributor cover-
age ratio reflects, in the case of contributory schemes, 
the number of those protected should they be affected 
by the contingency covered now or in the future. That 
is, the share of the employed population (or alterna-
tively the population of working age or in the labour 
force) which contributes directly or indirectly to social 
insurance in a given social security area and is thus 
likely to receive benefits when needed. An example is 
the percentage of employed persons contributing to a 
pension scheme. By extension, the protected person cov-
erage ratio includes people entitled to non-contributory 
benefits.

In respect of actual beneficiaries, the beneficiary 
coverage ratio describes the proportion of the popu-
lation affected by a certain contingency (e.g. older 
persons, unemployed) who actually benefit from the 
appropriate social security benefits (e.g. old-age pen-
sions, unemployment benefits). This ratio reflects the 
number of those actually receiving benefits, such as the 
number of beneficiaries of any pension benefits among 
all residents over the statutory pensionable age, or the 
number of beneficiaries of some kind of income sup-
port among all those unemployed or all below the pov-
erty line.

Measurements of the level of effective coverage would 
identify the levels of benefits (usually related to certain 

benchmark amounts) actually received by beneficiar-
ies, such as unemployment benefits or pensions paid, 
compared to average earnings or to the minimum wage 
or the poverty line. In the case of contributory pension 
schemes, the effective level of coverage may also relate to 
future benefit levels.

When assessing coverage and gaps in coverage, 
distinctions need to be made between coverage by 
(1) contributory social insurance, (2) universal schemes 
covering all residents (or all residents in a given cat-
egory2), and (3) means-tested schemes potentially cov-
ering all those who pass the required test of income 
and/or assets. In the case of social insurance it makes 
sense to look at the numbers of those who are actually 
members of and contributors to such schemes and who 
thus potentially enjoy – sometimes with their depend-
ants – coverage in the event of any of the contingen-
cies covered by their social insurance. These people fall 
into a category of persons “protected” in the event of 
a given contingency. The concept of protected persons 
may also apply where people are covered by universal or 
categor ical programmes: if there is legislation specify-
ing that all residents, or all residents in a given (e.g. age) 
category, are entitled to certain benefits or to free access 
to social services, it can be said that all those specified 
by law are “protected” in the event of the given contin-
gency. It is, however, rather difficult to specify who is 
in fact “potentially protected” in the case of income or 
means-tested benefits or conditional cash transfers. 

The above measures of extent and level of cover-
age are specifically applied to certain areas (branches) 
of social security (and sometimes even only to specific 
schemes or types of scheme), not to attempt to provide 
a generic measure of social security coverage. Ensuring 
the specificity of coverage indicators by area is essential 
to arrive at a meaningful analysis and ensure its rel-
evance for policy development. 

As an aggregate measure of coverage, the report 
uses the estimated proportion of the population enjoy-
ing comprehensive social security protection.3 Those 
enjoying only a basic level of income security (income 
security at the level of a nationally defined threshold, 
such as the poverty line) at all stages of the life cycle 
as well as access to essential health care (as nationally 
defined) are considered to benefit from basic social 
protection (the social protection floor, as defined in 

2  Such schemes are also referred to as categorical schemes.
3  This estimate is based on the number of persons of working age who enjoy comprehensive social security coverage, i.e. are covered by law in 
all eight areas (sickness, unemployment, old-age, employment injury, family responsibilities, maternity, invalidity, survivorship) in line with 
Convention No. 102. Health is not included for methodological reasons.

168

Recommendation No. 202). Those benefiting from cov-
erage (basic or comprehensive) in some of the areas are 
considered to enjoy only partial basic or partial com-
prehensive coverage. The ultimate objective of all ILO 
standards is to provide as many people as possible with 
comprehensive protection; the intermediate objective 
is to provide all people with at least a basic level of 
protection.

Coverage in health

As regards coverage in health, dimensions similar 
to those used for other branches apply; however, ap-
proaches and indicators need to be adjusted, particu-
larly with regard to the provision of medical benefits in 
kind. For example, the provision of quality medical care 
requires considering the availability of skilled health 
workers. Another difference from other branches re-
lates to the fact that taking up health-care benefits 
often requires private expenditure, even if affiliation to 
a health system or scheme exists. Thus, implementing 
social protection rights to health care requires ensuring 
access to health care if needed and avoiding impoverish-
ment arising from ill health.

Coverage in health has several dimensions:

•  Legal health coverage: identification of the propor-
tion of the population that is protected by legislation 
or otherwise affiliated to a health system or scheme. 
It is measured by one indicator, as explained below. 
•  Affordability, availability and financial protec-
tion of quality benefits: the scope of quality med-
ical benefits that is available, given e.g. the existence 
of a sufficient number of skilled health workers that 
can be accessed when in need without involving fi-
nancial hardship or impoverishment. It is measured 
by four proxy indicators, as explained below.

Against this background, assessing coverage in health 
requires all dimensions to be taken into account simul-
taneously, using five proxy indicators. They should meas-
ure deficits regarding specific thresholds. Only when 
data are considered from all five indicators  together are 
insights provided into the status quo and/or progress to-
wards universal coverage in health. 

The indicator for legal health coverage meas-
ures the share of a population (percentage of total 
population) or its specific groups effectively affiliated 
to or registered in a public or private health system 
or scheme: mainly national health services, or social, 

national, private or micro/community-based schemes. 
It is usually measured as a deficit compared to 100 per 
cent of the population in a given country and provides 
information on the current status and progress of popu-
lation coverage in terms of affiliation for each country 
and region, and at the global level.

The indicators for affordability, availability and 

financial protection of quality benefits are: 

1.  Extent of out-of-pocket payments (OOP) as a percent-
age of total health expenditure: The direct outlays of 
households, including gratuities and payments in kind, 
made to health practitioners and suppliers of pharma-
ceuticals, therapeutic appliances and other goods and 
services, whose primary intent is to contribute to the 
restoration or to the enhancement of the health status 
of individuals or population groups. It includes house-
hold payments to public services, non-profit institutions 
and non-governmental organizations, and non-reim-
bursable cost-sharing, deductibles, co-payments and 
fees-for-service, but excludes payments made by com-
panies that deliver medical and paramedical benefits, 
whether required by law or not, to their employees. It 
excludes payments for overseas treatment.

2.  Coverage gap due to health professional staff deficit. 
This indicator reflects both the supply side of access in 
terms of availability of health care and the proportion 
of the population not having access to health care due 
to the absence of a sufficient health workforce. 

The element first focuses on the availability of 
human resources at a level that guarantees at least basic, 
but universal, effective access for everybody. To esti-
mate access to the services of skilled medical profession-
als (physicians and nursing and midwifery personnel), 
it uses as a proxy the relative difference between the 
density of health professionals in a given country and 
its median value in countries with a low level of vulner-
ability (population access to services of medical profes-
sionals in countries with low vulnerability is thus used 
as a threshold for other countries).

The relative ILO threshold corresponds to the 
median value in the group of countries assessed as “low 
vulnerability”. Countries have been classified in four 
groups according to their level of vulnerability: very low, 
low, high and very high vulnerability (see table AII.1). 
The classification is based on three criteria: level of 
poverty, extent of informal economy and fairness of 
health-financing mechanisms. Proxies used are (1) the 
incidence of poverty, based on the international poverty 
line of income or consumption at or below US$2 PPP

a day; (2) non-waged employment as a proxy indicator 
of informal employment; and (3) with regard to coun-
tries with low vulnerability, health expenditure not fi-
nanced by OOP to a level above 40 per cent of total 
health expenditure. The population-weighted median 
number of skilled health workers (physicians and nurs-
ing and midwifery personnel) in countries considered 
to be at low vulnerability serves as the threshold. Given 
the socio-economic characteristics of these countries 
and the health-financing mechanisms applied, these 
countries are considered to be in a position to provide 
universal access through a sufficient number of health 
workers enjoying decent working conditions. In 2014, 
the threshold stands at 41.1 physicians, nursing and 
midwifery personnel per 10,000 population. Individual 
countries’ deficits are calculated using this threshold 
and the actual number of health workers.

Another way to look at the indicator is to refer to 
population not covered due to a deficit from the supply 
side. In this context, the ILO staff access deficit indica-
tor estimates the dimension of the overall performance 
of health-care delivery as a percentage of the population 
that has no access to health care if needed.

Further considerations

169

The main sources of this information are: country legis-
lation; data on protected persons, beneficiaries, benefits 
provided, costs and financing from the registers and 
accounts of the institutions administering the various 
social security schemes; and household survey data 
from regular labour force surveys, household income 
and expenditure surveys, household budget surveys or 
surveys of similar type, or from surveys specially de-
signed to monitor the coverage and impacts of social 
security.

To summarize, a number of issues have to be taken 

into account when measuring coverage:
•  Social security coverage can be directly measured 
only separately for each of the specific branches such 
as health care, old age or unemployment, or even for 
a group of specific schemes within each branch. Ag-
gregate coverage measures such as the ADB Social 
Protection Index can be built only by aggregating 
the separate coverage indicators for all social se-
curity branches.

•  Coverage by social security schemes against spe-
cific social risks and contingencies can be under-
stood in two ways: potential coverage, measured by 
the number of persons protected if a given contin-
gency occurs (for example, those covered by social 
insurance schemes, or contributors to such schemes), 
and actual coverage, measured by the number of 
beneficiaries actually receiving benefits or utilizing 

170

services. These two concepts are complementary to 
each other and should be assessed separately.

•  Legal and effective coverage are distinct and must be 
measured separately. Though people may be legally 
covered, enforcement of the legal provisions may be 
incomplete, so that effective coverage is usually lower 
than legal coverage.

•  In measuring the extent of coverage it is important 
to choose the right numerator and denominator. 
Ideally, the absolute number of persons covered for a 
specific risk is divided by the size of the population 
group targeted by the specific policy or benefit. For 
example, to measure the extent of actual coverage by 
old-age pensions, the number of pensioners should 
be related to the total number of older persons, 
where both numerator and denominator can be re-
stricted to a given age bracket, such as those over 65 
(or above any other statutory pensionable age).

•  There is a trade-off between specificity of national 
circumstances (and relevance of the indicator at the 
national level regarding, for example, the retirement 
age) and international comparability.

•  Both administrative and survey data are necessary 
to arrive at a full assessment of coverage. Adminis-
trative data are needed to assess potential and actual 
effective coverage rates. However, the availability 
and quality of such data vary across countries, and 
across schemes within countries. Very often, admin-
istrative data trace certain administratively regis-
tered events (such as payment of contributions or 
benefits) rather than the people behind such events. 
This leads to double counting, in particular when 
aggregating administrative data, as one individual 
can be contributing to the same scheme from more 
than one job, or to more than one scheme covering 
the same contingency, or be receiving similar types 
of benefit from more than one source.

•  Household survey data are particularly important 
in assessing the level and quality of coverage and 
its impacts. Also, only household survey data can 
help to assess the nature of coverage gaps, the char-
acteristics of population groups not covered, and in 
particular the consequences of their lack of coverage 
and their need for specific types of coverage. Unfor-
tunately, many regular household surveys still either 
lack information relevant to assessing coverage, or 
pose questions that are so various that international 
comparisons are not possible. Special surveys, too, 
are rare and also not internationally standardized.

This annex has presented a recommended approach to 
measuring coverage. Unfortunately, as the data actu-
ally available are still limited, it has proved difficult to 
follow the recommended approach fully in compiling 
the present report. In consequence, the report is limited 
to a detailed assessment of coverage in selected social 
security areas, and does not fully measure all dimen-
sions of coverage; moreover, data are available for too 
few countries for an assessment of the level and quality 
of coverage in most of the social security branches to be 
made. This report therefore presents regional estimates 
for selected indicators of coverage on the basis of avail-
able data. These regional estimates are calculated when 
data availability ensures that countries included repre-
sent at least three quarters of the total population for a 
given region. Regional averages are weighted, depending 
on the indicator, by total population, the working-age 
population, persons in the labour force or in employ-
ment. Owing to the limitations in data availability, most 
of these regional estimates are calculated for the latest 
available year, which is not necessarily the same for all 
the countries included. While data availability has al-
ready improved since the first edition of this report, it is 
hoped that further progress in improving national and 
subnational statistics on social security will further en-
hance the accuracy of global and regional estimates.

World Social Protection Report 2014/15Annex III
Minimum requirements in 
ILO social security standards: 
Overview tables

ILO social security standards serve as key references, 

guiding all ILO policy and technical advice in the 
field of social security. They also give meaning and 
definition to the content of the right to social security 
as laid down in international human rights instruments 
(notably the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 
1948, and the International Covenant on Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights, 1966), thereby constituting 
essential tools for the realization of this right and the 
effective implementation of a rights-based approach to 
social protection.

The ILO’s normative social security framework con-
sists of eight up-to-date Conventions and Recommen-
dations. The most prominent of these are the Social 
Security (Minimum Standards) Convention, 1952 
(No. 102), and the Social Protection Floors Recommen-
dation, 2012 (No. 202).1 Convention No. 102 is unique 
among international standards in regrouping the nine 
classical social security contingencies (medical care, 
sickness, unemployment, old age, employment injury, 
family responsibilities, maternity, invalidity, survivor-
ship) into a single comprehensive and legally binding 
instrument. It sets qualitative and quantitative bench-
marks for each of these contingencies, which together 
determine the minimum standards of social security 
protection to be provided by social security schemes 
with regard, inter alia, to:

171171

•  definition of the contingency (what must be covered?)
•  persons protected (who must be covered?)
• 
type and rate of benefits (what should be provided?)
•  entitlement conditions, including qualifying period 
(what  should  a  person  do  to  get  the  right  to  a 
benefit?)

•  duration of benefit and waiting period (how long 

must the benefit be paid/provided for?) 

In addition, it establishes common rules of collective or-
ganization, financing and management, and lays down 
principles for good governance, including the general 
responsibility of the State for the due provision of bene-
fits and proper administration of social security sys-
tems, participatory management, guarantee of defined 
benefits, adjustment of pensions, right of appeal and 
complaint, collective financing and risk-pooling, and 
periodical actuarial valuations. Convention No. 102 
continues to serve as a yardstick and reference in the 
gradual development of comprehensive social security 
coverage at the national level and as a means to prevent 
the levelling down of social security systems worldwide, 
as confirmed by the International Labour Conference 
in 2011 (ILO, 2012a). 

Tables AIII.1–AIII.9 below provide a summary 
overview of some of the key requirements set out in 
ILO standards. 

1  Convention No. 102 has been ratified to date by 50 countries, most recently by Brazil (2009), Bulgaria (2008), Honduras (2012), Jordan 
(2014), Romania (2009) and Uruguay (2010), and provides guidance for all 185 ILO member States. ILO Recommendations are not open 
for ratification.

5  Myanmar enacted its social security law in 2012. The laws includes provisions for most social security branches including old age, survivors, disability, family benefits and unemployment insurance benefit (section 37), but 

the country is at the stage of drafting the regulations and provisions are not yet being implemented. 

6  Cuba. Family/child benefits: Dependants of young workers conscripted into military service are eligible for assistance from social security. Cash benefits are available for families whose head of household is unemployed due 

to health, disability or other justifiable causes, and has insufficient income for food and medicine or basic household needs.

7  Dominica. Family/child benefits: Benefits are paid to unemployed single mothers with unmarried children younger than age 18 (age 21 if a full-time student, no limit if disabled) who lack sufficient resources to meet basic 

needs. (Social assistance benefits are provided under the Old Age, Disability, and Survivors programme.)

8  Ecuador. Family/child benefits: No statutory benefits are provided. Mothers assessed as needy with at least one child (younger than age 18) and low-income families receive a monthly allowance under the Bono de 

Desarrollo Humano programme.

Definitions
The scope of coverage is measured by the number of social security policy areas (branches) provided for by law. This indicator can take the value 0 to 8 according to the total number of social security policy areas (or 
branches) with a programme anchored in national legislation.  
The eight following branches are taken into consideration: sickness, maternity, old age, survivors, invalidity, child/family allowances, employment injury and unemployment.
The number of branches covered by at least one programme provides an overview of the scope of legal social security provision.

a   Severance payment: in the national law (e.g. labour code) and directly paid by employers but no unemployment benefit programme anchored in national legislation.
b  Unemployed beneficiaries of general social assistance schemes are not included due to unavailability of data. Including them would increase coverage rates but only in countries where such schemes exist on a larger scale 

(high-income and some middle-income countries).

2  In the absence of social security benefit in case of unemployment, workers covered by the labour law may 

be entitled to severance payment (as a lump-sum payment) on the basis usually of a minimum length 
of service and/or the reason for the termination of the employment relation, sometimes depending on 
professional categories, size of enterprise or other criteria. Severance payment is a lump sum. 31 countries 
without unemployment benefit programme anchored in legislation provide such labour protection 
(information available in the ILO Employment Protection Legislation database (EPLex) and in SSA and 
ISSA, Social security programs throughout the world, Washington, DC and Geneva).

3  Cameroon. No programme anchored in legislation. Arts 1 and 2 of the Order No. 016 of 26 May 1993: a 
worker is entitled to severance pay provided he has been employed for at least two years and he has not 
committed any serious misconduct. Severance pay corresponds to a percentage of the monthly overall 
wages per year of service and is set according to the length of service. 

4  Comoros: No programme anchored in legislation. Article 48 of the Labour Code (former art. 50): severance 

pay and redundancy pay are to be defined by decree after consultation of the Advisory Council of Labour 
and Employment (former Supreme Labour Council) and must take into account, in particular, worker’s 
tenure and professional categories. No decree has been adopted as of October 2012.

5  Côte d’Ivoire. No programme anchored in legislation. Art. 3 Decree No. 96-200: a worker is entitled to 

severance pay provided he has been employed continuously for a period of at least one year and he has 
not committed any serious misconduct. Severance pay corresponds to a percentage of the monthly overall 
wages for each year of service. 

6  Ethiopia. No programme anchored in legislation. Art. 40 (1) &(2) LP: severance pay amounts to 30 times 

the average daily pay of the last week of service for the first year of service. 

7  Gabon. No programme anchored in legislation. Arts 70 and 73 LC: a worker is entitled to severance pay 

provided he has been employed for at least two years and he has not committed any serious misconduct. 
Severance pay corresponds, as a minimum, to 20% of the monthly overall wages per year of service. 

8  Lesotho. No programme anchored in legislation. Art. 79 LC: A worker is entitled to severance pay 

provided he has not been dismissed for misconduct and has completed more than one year of service. 
Severance pay shall amount to two weeks’ wages for each year of service. However, the 1997 Labour Code 
Amendment Act provides for exemptions from statutory severance pay. 

9  Libya: The 1980 Social Security Law requires employers to pay a severance benefit to laid-off employees 

equal to 100 per cent of earnings for up to six months. 

10  Morocco. No programme anchored in legislation. According to art. 53 LC, severance pay is due after 6 months 

of service. It corresponds to a number of hours per year that varies according to the length of service.

11  Namibia. No programme anchored in legislation. An employer must pay severance pay to an employee 

who has completed 12 months of continuous service (sec. 35 LA), if the employee is dismissed, dies while 
employed or resigns after reaching the age of 65 years. The amount of severance pay must be equal to at 
least one week’s remuneration for each year of continuous service with the employer (sec. 35 (3)).

12  Nigeria. The Pension Reform Act of 2004 provides enabling legislation for the National Social Insurance 
Trust Fund to introduce a social insurance programme for unemployment benefits. No scheme has been 
implemented to date. The Provident Fund Act of 1961 permits limited cash drawdown payments after one 
year of unemployment for insured persons who contributed under the previous provident fund system.
13  Rwanda. No programme anchored in legislation. According to art. 35 LL, upon dismissal, workers are 
entitled to severance pay (“dismissal compensation”) provided that they have completed a period of at 
least twelve (12) consecutive months of work. 

14  Seychelles. Under the 1980 Unemployment Fund Act, the social security fund provides subsistence 

income for unemployed persons. Data available refer to the unemployment relief scheme. National Bureau 
of Statistics: Seychelles in figures, 2008 and 2012 (available at: http://www.nbs.gov.sc/wp-content/
uploads/2011/08/Seychelles-In-Figures-2011-Edition1.pdf, accessed May 2014).

15  Tanzania, United Republic of. No programme anchored in legislation. Severance pay is defined in the 

ELRA as an amount equal to seven days basic wage for each completed year of continuous service with 
that employer up to a maximum of ten years (art. 42(1) ELRA). An employer is required to pay severance 
on termination of employment if the employee has completed 12 months of continuous service with an 
employer and the employer terminates the employment (art. 42(2) ELRA). 

16  Uganda. No programme anchored in legislation. The amount of severance pay is subject to negotiation 

between the employer and the workers or the trade union that represents them (art. 89 EA). The law also 
lists circumstances where severance pay is not due (i.e summary dismissal) (art. 88 EA). It seems that, in 
the event of ordinary fair dismissal (including collective dismissals for economic reasons), the dismissed 
employee is not entitled to severance pay.

17  Bangladesh. No programme anchored in legislation. The 2008 labour law requires employers to provide 
a termination benefit, a retrenchment and lay-off benefit, and a benefit for discharge from service on the 
grounds of ill health to workers in shops and commercial and industrial establishments. Monthly paid 
permanent employees receive half the average basic wage for 120 days (plus a lump-sum payment of one 
month’s salary for each year of service); casual workers for 60 days (plus a lump-sum payment of 14 days’ 
wages for each year of service); and temporary workers for 30 days. 

18  Cambodia. No programme anchored in legislation. Art. 89 LC: if the worker is dismissed for a reason other 
than serious misconduct, the employer must pay an indemnity for dismissal. The amount of the indemnity 
depends upon the employee’s length of continuous service. This only applies to contracts of an unspecified 
duration. Art. 73 LC provides that at the expiration of a fixed-term contract (the end of the term or completion 
of the task), the employer must pay the employee severance pay which may be fixed by collective agreement 
but should not in any case be less than 5% of the total wages paid during the length of the contract.

19  Georgia. For years 2000 and 2005: Interstate Statistical Committee of the Commonwealth of independent 
States (CIS) (available at: http://www.cisstat.com/0base/index-en.htm, accessed May 2014). From 2006: 
the 2006 (labour code) regulates severance pay for employed persons. In the case of termination by 
the employer, the employer pays one month of average monthly earnings (unless otherwise stated in the 
employment contract). 

20 India. Numerator: ILO Social security inquiry. “Unemployment allowance” was added in 2005 to the 

existing Employees’ State Insurance Corporation scheme, which covers sickness and maternity, and covers 
24% of all formal-sector workers, or 2% of the entire workforce. Does not include beneficiaries from the 
National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme. The target group for this programme is broader than 
unemployed.

21  Indonesia. No programme anchored in legislation. Under art. 156 of the Manpower Act, termination of 
the employment relationship gives rise to termination payments that include severance pay and /or long 
service pay. The amounts provided here correspond to severance pay: one month’s wages for each year 
of service, up to a maximum of nine months’ pay. The extent of the termination package depends on the 

World Social Protection Report 2014/15circumstances of termination. In the event of termination on the grounds of grave wrongdoing, or absence 
for five consecutive workdays without explanation, the worker is not entitled to any severance pay or long 
service pay (art. 160 MA). However, if a worker is terminated on the grounds of violation of the terms of 
employment, he will be nonetheless entitled to severance pay and reward pay (arts 158 (1) and 168 (1) MA).

22 Jordan. The recent social security reform includes unemployment Insurance but statistics are not yet 

available.

23  Malaysia. No programme anchored in legislation. The Employment (Termination and Lay-off Benefits) 

Regulations 1980 provide for statutory severance pay in the event of termination: ten days’ wages for each 
completed year of service of less than two years; 15 days’ wages for each year of two to five years’ service; 
20 days’ wages for each year of service exceeding five years. These regulations apply to employees with more 
than one year’s service (sec. 3(1)) and do not apply to dismissals for misconduct, after due inquiry (sec. 4). 

24  Myanmar. Myanmar enacted its social security law in 2012. The law includes unemployment insurance 

benefit (sec. 37), but the country is at the stage of drafting the regulations and provisions are not yet being 
implemented. 

25  Nepal. No programme anchored in legislation. The 1992 Labour Act requires employers to pay lump-

sum severance benefits to laid-off employees equal to one month of wages for each year of service 
in all establishments employing ten or more workers. The 1993 Labour Rules require employers in 
establishments with ten or more workers to pay a cash benefit to workers with at least three years of 
employment when they retire or resign, as follows: 50% of monthly wages for each of the first seven years 
of service, 66% of monthly wages for each year between seven and 15 years, and 100% of monthly wages 
for each year of service exceeding 15 years. The employee may choose between a cash benefit and a 
lump sum.

26 Pakistan. No programme anchored in legislation. The labour code requires employers with 20 employees 

or more to pay a severance payment equal to the last 30 days of wages for each year of employment. 

27  Philippines. No programme anchored in legislation. 
28 Sri Lanka. No programme anchored in legislation. Under the Payment of Gratuity Act (PGA), upon any 

termination of employment, every employer who employs 15 or more shall pay to any monthly paid 
employee who has worked for at least five years a gratuity payment which amounts to half a month’s salary 
for each completed year of service, or 14 days’ wages per year of service for non-monthly paid workers.  
This indemnity is payable regardless of the reason for termination (resignation, dismissal, retirement, death 
of the worker, by operation of law, or otherwise). See secs 5(1) and 6 PGA.

29 Syrian Arab Republic. No programme anchored in legislation. Termination by notice does not automatically 

entail severance pay. Under the LL, workers are entitled to severance pay only when the contract

…: Not available.

*  Labour Act (or labour code) which places the obligation within the employer’s liability.
1  Botswana. No statutory benefits are provided. The amended 2010 Employment Order requires employers 
in designated areas to pay maternity benefits to female employees. The maternity benefit is at least 50% 
of the basic pay and other benefits she would otherwise be entitled to receive, and is paid for six weeks 

before and six weeks after the expected date of childbirth; may be extended by two weeks if there are 
complications arising from pregnancy or childbirth.

2  Burkina Faso. The benefit provided by the Social Security Fund is equivalent to the percentage of the 

woman’s previous earnings on which social security contributions have been paid. The employer is 
mandated to cover the difference between this amount and the woman’s earnings gained just before 
maternity leave.

3  Burundi. The labour code (1993) requires employers to pay 50% of wages for maternity leave of up to 12 

weeks (14 weeks in the event of complications arising from pregnancy or childbirth), including at least 6 
weeks after childbirth, if the woman has at least 6 months of service during the year before the expected 
date of birth. 
The 1984 provision established a medical assistance programme to provide medical, surgical, maternity, 
hospitalization, dental and pharmaceutical services to the low-income population.

4  Cabo Verde. The employer pays the difference between 90% of the worker’s “normal” salary and cash 

benefits paid by social security. If none is paid, then the employer must pay the full amount of the benefits 
during the maternity leave period.

5  Congo, Democratic Republic. No statutory social security benefits are provided. The labour code requires 
employers to provide 14 weeks of paid maternity leave, and to provide medical care for workers and their 
dependants.

6  Eritrea. Paid, amount not specified or unidentified.

7  Ethiopia. No statutory social security benefits are provided. The public service amendment proclamation 

(2002) and the labour proclamation (2003) require employers to provide paid maternity leave for up to 45 
days after childbirth; thereafter, sick leave may be paid if there are complications arising from childbirth.

8  Guinea Bissau. The employer is mandated to pay the difference between social security benefits and 

previous earnings.

9  Kenya. No statutory social security benefits are provided. The 1976 Employment Act requires employers 
to pay 100% of earnings for up to two months of maternity leave. Employers also provide some obstetric 
benefits. Accredited government and certain private and faith-based hospitals provide comprehensive 
maternity care to members of the National Health Insurance Fund and their dependants.

10  Lesotho. According to art. 134 of the labour code (Order No. 24 of 1992, as amended in 2006), there is 
no legal obligation for employers to pay wages during maternity leave. However, the Labour Code Wages 
(Amendment) Order 2011 (LN No. 147 of 2011) sets out that workers in the textile, clothing, leather 
clothing and leather manufacturing industries are entitled to two weeks’ paid maternity leave, and workers 
in the private security sector to six weeks’ paid maternity leave and six weeks’ unpaid maternity leave. Any 
other employee in neither of these named sectors shall be entitled to receive six weeks’ paid maternity 
leave before confinement and six weeks’ paid maternity leave after confinement.

11  Libya. Maternity leave cash benefits are 50% of wages for employees, and 100% of presumptive income 

for self-employed women, paid by social insurance for 13 weeks (three months).

12  Malawi. Every three years.
13  Mauritius. No statutory social security benefits are provided. The 2008 Employment Rights Act requires 

employers to provide 12 weeks of paid maternity leave (at least six weeks after the expected date of 
childbirth) or five days of paid paternity leave to employees who have been in their continuous employment 
for at least 12 months. Government clinics and hospitals provide free medical services. Some mother and

b  As defined in United Nations Security Council resolution 1244 of 1999.

This table is complementary to table B.7. Non-contributory pension schemes: Main features and 
indicators (available at: http://www.social-protection.org/gimi/gess/RessourceDownload.action?ressource.
ressourceId=43197). 

1  Beneficiaries from the contributory pension can cumulate the basic benefits from the non-contributory 
pension and the top-up benefit from the contributory pension. Percentages indicated as an estimate of 
legal coverage correspond to the legal coverage from the non-contributory pension.

2  Malawi. In March 2011, a pension law established a mandatory old-age pension system based on 

individual accounts for private-sector workers earning above a minimum salary threshold. The law has yet 
to be implemented.

2  Seychelles. Social security fund: the Government contributes as an employer and guarantees the pension 
benefits. Makes contributions out of the general budget. Seychelles pension fund: 1% of monthly earnings 
for each insured person.

4  Sierra Leone. 2.5% of monthly income; 10% for civil servants and teachers; 12% for military and police 

personnel. 

5  Azerbaijan. 57 years old for a woman with three children or with a disabled child under 8.
6  China: (1) Basic pension insurance: Central and local governments provide subsidies as needed.  

(2) Pension schemes for rural and non salaried urban residents: 
– The basic pension of 55 yuan (CNY) (US$8.83 or PPP$35.17) per month is payable to older people 
aged 60 and over whose children participate in the scheme – “family-binding” eligibility criteria. 
– Mandatory individual account: Central and local governments provide subsidies as needed. Rural 
residents who are aged 16 and over, not in education and not enrolled in an urban pension scheme are 
eligible for an individual pension account. Participation is voluntary.  
* Individual contributions range from CNY100 to CNY500 annually (equivalent to between US$1.28 and 
US$6.24 per month). Local governments are to provide a partial matched contribution of at least CNY30 
(US$4.81 or PPP$19.50) per year regardless of individual contribution. 

* Participants aged 45 and over are encouraged to contribute higher amounts to meet the shortfall in 
contributions over their working lives. 
* Pensioners who have contributed for 15 years will be eligible for a basic flat-rate pension calculated by 
dividing accumulated contributions at 60 years by 139.

7  China. Estimates of legal coverage: legal coverage in rural areas: in June 2011, the Chinese Government 

decided to accelerate the pace of extension to cover 60% of the rural areas by the end of 2011, and all rural 
areas by the end of 2012. By law, 100% coverage is provided (on a voluntary basis) in rural areas.  
The same applied to the voluntary non-salaried urban pension scheme. On 1 June 2011 the Chinese 
Premier announced a new pilot pension insurance programme for non-employed urban residents, to be 
implemented as of 1 July 2011. Modelled on the new type of rural pension scheme, it was expected to 
cover 60% of China by the end of that year and to benefit all uninsured urban residents (around 50 million) 
by the end of 2012, in parallel with the new voluntary Rural Pension Scheme. The scheme covers, by law, 
all urban residents aged 16 and over (excluding school students) who are not engaged in employment and 
hence do not qualify for enrolment under the basic pension scheme for urban employees. All such residents 
can join the urban resident pension insurance programme on a voluntary basis at the place where their 
households have been registered. Enrolled residents can elect one of the ten scales ranging from CNY100 
to CNY1 000 as an annual contribution to their individual accounts, for which the Government will provide a 
subsidy of no less than CNY30 to each person every year. The scales may differ in different regions. 

8  China. Individual accounts (under contributory) also corresponds to legal coverage for the non-contributory 

component of rural and urban non-salaried pension schemes.

9  Israel: Through a contribution of 0.25% of insured persons’ earnings (old-age and survivor pensions), 

0.10% of insured persons’ earnings (disability benefits), and 0.02% of insured and self-employed persons’ 
earnings (long-term care), the Government subsidizes the following: 17.1% of total insured person and 
employer contributions; the total cost of special old-age and survivor benefits and long-term care benefits 
for new immigrants; and the total cost of social assistance income support programmes and the mobility 
allowance.

10  Japan: The social insurance system consists of a flat-rate benefit under the national pension program (NP) 

and an earnings-related benefit under the employees’ pension insurance program (EPI). Employers with 
more than 1 000 employees may contract out a portion of the EPI if they provide more generous benefits.

11  Kuwait: Basic system: Government: 10% of covered earnings (public employees), 32.5% of payroll (military 

personnel), and 25% of monthly income minus the self-employed person’s contributions (self-employed 
persons).

12  Taiwan (China): National pension programme: 2.8% of the monthly minimum wage. For disabled and low-
income insured persons, 7%, 4.9% or 3.85% of the monthly minimum wage, depending on the degree of 
disability or total family income. The monthly minimum wage is 18,780 Taiwan new dollars (TWD).  
Labour insurance programme (social insurance): 0.75% of employee earnings (0.8% in 2013, gradually 
rising to 1.2% by 2030); 3% of income for self-employed persons (3.2% in 2013, gradually rising to 4.8% 
by 2030); the cost of administration. The maximum monthly earnings used to calculate contributions are 
TWD$43,900. (The monthly earnings used to calculate contributions are adjusted according to changes in 
the minimum wage.) 
The Government’s contributions also finance cash sickness and maternity benefits.  
Labour pension fund (individual account): None.

13  Thailand: A new voluntary social security system for informal sector workers was initiated in 2011. The 

scheme is based on contributions from workers and Government to finance old-age, disability, survivors’, 
sickness and maternity benefits.

14  Thailand: Formal-sector system: 1% of gross monthly earnings (old-age benefits). 

The Government’s contributions also finance family benefits. Disability and survivor benefits are financed 
under sickness and maternity. 
The minimum monthly earnings used to calculate contributions are 1 650 baht (THB). 
The maximum monthly earnings used to calculate contributions are THB15 000. 
Informal-sector system: THB30 a month (sickness, disability, and survivor benefits) or THB50 a month 
(old-age, sickness, disability, and survivor benefits).

15  Viet Nam. Subsidies as necessary and the total cost of old-age pensions for workers who retired before 

1995; contributions for those employed in the public sector before January 1995.

16  Finland. Universal pension: total cost of universal pensions, housing allowances, disability allowances, 

26 Turkey: In May 2006, the separate systems for public and private-sector employees and the self-employed 

pensioner care allowances and war veterans’ benefits. 
Earnings-related pension: The total cost of covered study periods for students and unpaid periods of child

programme (unless an account holder opted out). Since 2009, participation in the individual account 
programme is voluntary.

18  Latvia: Municipalities provide social assistance benefits (means-tested and conditional) to the needy.
19  Norway: A new pension system introduced in 2011 replaces the universal pension with a guaranteed 

minimum benefit and the earnings-related pension with an NDC scheme. The new system covers persons 
born since 1963. Persons born before 1954 remain under the old system. A transitional (mixed) system, a 
combination of the old and new systems, covers persons born between 1954 and 1962.

20 Poland: The total cost of the guaranteed minimum pension; pays pension contributions for insured persons 

taking child-care leave or receiving maternity allowances, for persons receiving unemployment benefits 
and for unemployed graduates.

21  San Marino: A system of mandatory individual accounts was introduced in 2012 as a supplement to the 

social insurance system. Both the insured person and the employer are required to contribute.

22 Slovakia: Since 1 April 2012, individual accounts are mandatory for new entrants to the labour force. They 

may opt out of the system within two years.

and former military personnel; pays employer contributions for farmers; covers any deficit in the event of 
an unforeseen decline in contributions; finances social assistance benefits; contributes as an employer.
25  Spain: Non-contributory pensions and in-kind complementary benefits are provided for elderly persons 

were merged into one under the newly created Social Security Institution.

27  Argentina: From 1994 until the end of 2008, there was a mixed system where all insured workers were 

in the first-pillar public pay-as-you-go (PAYG) system; for the second pillar, workers chose between 
contributing to an individual account and to the PAYG defined benefit system. A 2008 law closed the 
second-pillar individual accounts and transferred all workers and their account balances to the new one-
pillar PAYG system.

28 Bolivia: In 1997, all active members of the social insurance system transferred to a system of privately 

managed mandatory individual accounts.

29 Costa Rica: The minimum monthly pension is 113,181 colones; if the calculated pension amount is lower, 

a lump sum is paid.

30 Mexico: social insurance old-age benefits, 0.225% of covered earnings plus an average flat-rate amount of 
3.55 pesos (depending on the salary range) for each day the insured contributes; for disability and survivor

31  Peru: When public- and private-sector employees enter the workforce, they may choose between the 

individual account system (SPP) and the public social insurance system (SNP). Insured persons who do 
not make a choice become SPP members. SNP members may switch to the SPP but may not switch 
back, except under certain circumstances.

32  Uruguay: The mixed social insurance and individual account system is mandatory for employed and self-
employed persons born after 1 April 1956, with monthly earnings greater than 24,709 pesos (UYU) and 
voluntary for those with monthly earnings of UYU24,709 or less. All others are covered only by the social 
insurance system.

33 Australia: Social security: the total cost from general revenue. Mandatory occupational pension 

(superannuation): matches voluntary contributions by the insured, up to 1 000 Australian dollars (AUD) a 
year for those with annual incomes up to AUD31 920 (co-contribution gradually decreases to 0 for annual 
incomes between AUD31 920 and AUD61  920). Contributions are calculated based on after-tax income 
and are not tax deductible.

34 Micronesia: Contribution from employer is 7.5% of twice the salary of the highest-paid employee per

Notes
…: not available
a  Exceeds 100%.
Year introduced: the first scheme that is the legal predecessor of any current scheme is indicated. Most schemes 
have been reformed since and the current legislation is rarely that of the founding year.
Legal requirements: categories of criteria applicants have to fulfil, e.g. holding citizenship of the country in question, 
having a legal residence, having income below a set level or passing an income test, having assets below a set level, 
not receiving any other pension or receiving only a low pension. Other criteria includes all other legal requirements. 
Geographical targeting means that the pension is available only in specific areas in the country. Non-working 
means that the potential beneficiary cannot either be formally employed or practise any gainful activity. Not in state 
institution means that elderly who are at home are excluded in the given country. It is also in this column that it is 
indicated if the programme is comprehensive, offering other services such as elderly care or discounts in utilities 
(the two most common). Special amount indicates whether there is a differentiated amount depending on civil status 
or age or any other criterion.
b  As defined in United Nations Security Council resolution 1244 of 1999.

Additional notes by country
Africa
Algeria.  Including old age ‘reversion pension’ but excluding anticipated 
pension. Office national de la statistique (available at: http://www.ons.dz/
IMG/pdf/AQC_R_2011_ED_2012_-_Francais.pdf, accessed May 2014).
Burundi.  Includes old age, survivors pensions for people aged 60 and 
over. 
Cabo Verde. For the contributory pension provided by CNPS, the statutory 
pensionable age is 65 and over for men and 60 and over for women. As 
the non-contributory pension targets people aged 60 and over (either men 
or women), the population of reference for the denominator has been set 
at age 60.
Côte d’Ivoire.  Data from the CNPS (Caisse Nationale de Prévoyance 
Sociale) and CGRAE (Caisse Générale de Retraite des Agents de l’Etat).
Madagascar.  Data refer to the Caisse Nationale de la Prévoyance Sociale 
(CNaPS) and two occupational schemes for civil servants: the Caisse 
de Retraites Civiles et Militaires (CRCM), which covers civil servants, 
government workers and the military; and the Caisse de Prévoyance et de 
Retraites (CPR), which covers auxiliary agents employed by the Government, 
who have not yet been granted full government employee status.
Malawi.  There is no national social insurance scheme in Malawi. The 
Government Public Pension Scheme is a non-contributory, defined benefit, 
PAYG system. There are around 600 private pension funds in Malawi not 
included here.

Asia, Oceania and the Middle East
Bangladesh.  The Government of Bangladesh provides its own employees 
with a non-contributory, defined benefit pension with survivor benefits, 
funded through tax revenues. Civil servants are eligible to receive a 
pension at the age of 57. 
China.  The indicator for China includes contributors to the new rural social 
pension plan introduced nationwide in 2009. This new pension has two 
components: a basic pension component financed by local and central 
Government and a personal account component based on contributions 
from enrolled individuals. In relatively poor regions the central Government 
pays approximately 80% of the cost of the basic pension component and 
the local Government bears the rest. The first basic pension component 
justifies inclusion in this indicator, focusing on periodic cash benefits for 
the elderly to ensure basic income security.
Iran, Islamic Rep. of.  Corresponds to total number of insured as principal 
contributors and refers to the social security organization and State 
retirement fund.
Lebanon.  There is currently no income security for the elderly through

Table B.9  Old-age effective coverage: Old-age pension beneficiaries

Notes
1  Differences from proportions indicated in table B.7 may result from: 
differences in reference years; differences in population of reference 
between the non-contributory pension and the statutory pensionable age 
considered here as the main criterion to define the population of reference 
applied to all pensions.

National sources (see below).

Additional notes by country
Africa
Algeria.  Including old-age reversion pension but excluding anticipated 
pension. Non-contributory pension (data for 2009): Evolution de la 
catégorie des personnes âgées bénéficiaires de l’AFS (périodes: 2004-
2009). Reference population: eligible age 60 years.
Angola.  Total number of pensioners. There is no general social assistance 
programme aimed at the elderly.
Burundi.  Includes old age, survivors and ascendent pensions for people 
aged 60 and over.
Cameroon.  Data for the public pension schemes are estimated based on 
data available for previous years.
Cabo Verde.  Regarding the contributory pension provided by CNPS, 
the statutory retirement age is 65 and over for men and 60 and over 
for women. However, as the age of eligibility for the non-contributory 
pension is 60 for both men and women, the reference population for the 
denominator has been set at 60. Survey data (provided in this Statistical 
Annex) provide lower numbers than administrative sources.
Congo.  Includes disability and survivors’ pensioners above statutory 
pensionable age of 60.
Côte d’Ivoire.  Data from the CNPS (Caisse Nationale de Prévoyance 
Sociale) and CGRAE (Caisse Générale de Retraite des Agents de l’Etat).
Gabon.  The number refers to all pensions, resulting in a possible 
overestimation of old-age pensioners.

Middle East, Asia and the Pacific
Azerbaijan.  Eligible age for non-contributory pension: 67 years old and over 
for men and 62 for women. For the calculation of the coverage, the lower 
eligible age (statutory pensionable age) is taken for consistency reasons.

China.  The indicator for China includes old-age pension recipients from 
the new rural social pension plan introduced nationwide in 2009. This 
new pension has two components: a basic pension component financed 
by local and central Government, and a personal account component 
based on contributions from enrolled individuals. In relatively poor regions 
the central Government pays approximately 80% of the cost of the basic 
pension component and the local Government bears the rest. The first 
basic pension component justifies inclusion in this indicator, focusing on 
periodic cash benefits for elderly to ensure basic income security.
Iran, Islamic Rep. of.  Refers to the social security organization and State 
retirement fund.
Lebanon.  There is currently no income security for elderly through regular 
old-age pension benefits, only a lump sum. 
Malaysia.  Includes government pension scheme, which is the only one 
providing cash periodic benefits, and a social assistance programme 
targeting poor elderly with no family support.
New Zealand.  Percentage by sex estimated based on distribution from 
2011.
Philippines.  The old-age grant, launched in 2011, and the retirement 
programme for veterans, are considered non-contributory schemes.
Samoa.  The Samoa National Provident Fund provides the option for a 
retirement pension or full withdrawal. Since the majority of SNPF members 
take the option of full withdrawal, there were only 445 pensioners and 
276 beneficiaries (i.e. 3.7% of persons age 55 and over) in 2011. 
Sri Lanka.  This indicator refers to contributory mandatory schemes 
providing pensions for people above statutory retirement age (i.e. it 
excludes PSPS, which is a non-contributory schemes; EPF and ETF, 
providing lump sums; and the three voluntary social security schemes, 
Farmers’ Pension and Social Security Benefit Scheme, Fishermen’s 
Pension and Social Security Benefit Scheme, and Social Pension and 
Social Security Benefit Scheme (initially for self-employed only), which 
are voluntary and provide either lump-sum or periodic benefits (available 
at: http://www.statistics.gov.lk/abstract2010/Pages/index.htm, accessed 
December 2013).
Thailand.  These proportions refer only to beneficiaries of the old-age 
or disability social pensions. As a result the reference taken is not the 
statutory pensionable age of 55 but the age of eligibility for the old-age 
social pension (60 and over). 
Tonga.  Only a minority of members opt for a regular pension once 
reaching pensionable age. In September 2010, the National Retirement 
Benefits Scheme (NRBS) Bill 2010 was passed by the Legislative 
Assembly, Providing a similar mandatory superannuation plan for the 
private sector and other organizations. No statistics available yet. 
Vanuatu.  Mainly withdrawals.

Europe
Albania.  Includes old-age pensions including war veteran, special merit 
and supplementary pensions. Ratio above statutory retirement age.

Latin America and the Caribbean
Brazil.  Age range used for the indicators: 65 and over for both men and 
woment despite a statutory retirement age of 60 for women.
Colombia.  Age range used for the indicator: 65 and over.
Costa Rica.  The normal retirement age is 65 years with at least 300 
months of contributions. Age 65 years is used as a basis to define the 
reference population for this indicator.
Dominican Republic.  Age range used for the indicator: 65 and over. 
Nicaragua.  The normal retirement age of 60 years is used as a basis to 
define the reference population for this indicator.
Panama.  The normal retirement age of 62 (men) or 57 (women) is used as 
a basis to define the reference population for this indicator. 
Uruguay.  Proportion calculated for people aged 60 and over. For people 
aged 65 and over, this proportion reaches 85.9%,

North America
United States.  Retirement (includes OASI), all beneficiaries aged 65 and 
over. Includes beneficiaries in foreign countries.

Sources
This indicator is calculated using the national health accounts estimates 
available in: WHO (World Health Organization): National Health Accounts 
(Global Health Expenditure database). Available at:  
http://apps.who.int/nha/database [6 June 2014].
For further information on estimating out-of-pocket (OOP) expenditures, see

Definitions
Out-of-pocket spending by private households (OOPs) is the direct outlay 
of households, including gratuities and payments in kind, made to health 
practitioners and suppliers of pharmaceuticals, therapeutic appliances 
and other goods and services, whose primary intent is to contribute to 

the restoration or to the enhancement of the health status of individuals 
or population groups. It includes household payments to public services, 
non-profit institutions and non-governmental organizations. It includes 
non-reimbursable cost-sharing, deductibles, co-payments and fee-for-
service, but excludes payments made by companies that deliver medical 
and paramedical benefits, whether required by law or not, to their 
employees. It excludes payments for overseas treatment.

Total (public and private) health-care expenditure not financed  
by private households’ out-of-pocket payments
The effective level of financial protection provided to the population by 
social health protection systems is measured here by a proxy indicator 
expressed as a percentage of total (public and private) health-care 
expenditure in the country not financed by private households through 
out-of-pocket payments. The proxy is more or less equivalent to the 
percentage of total (public and private) health-care expenditure in the 
country financed either by general Government or by pre-paid private 
insurance, by employers or NGOs.

Notes
n.a: Not applicable.
…: Not available.
6  Estimate of health coverage as a percentage of total population. Coverage includes affiliated members 
of health insurance or estimation of the population having free access to health care services provided 
by the State. Consult detailed data and sources available at: http://www.social-protection.org/gimi/gess/
RessourceDownload.action?ressource.ressourceId=37218.

7  Out-of-pocket expenditure as a percentage of total health expenditure: see table B.10.
8  Percentage of the population not covered due to professional health staff deficit (based on 1. median value 

in low vulnerability group of countries or 2. WHO benchmark). 
The ILO staff access deficit indicator reflects the supply side of access availability – in this case the 
availability of human resources at a level that guarantees at least basic, but universal, effective access to 
everybody. To estimate access to the services of skilled medical professionals (physicians and nursing and 
midwifery personnel), it uses as a proxy the relative difference between the density of health professionals 
in a given country and its median value in countries with a low level of vulnerability (population access 
to services of medical professionals in countries with low vulnerability is thus used as a benchmark for 
other countries). The relative ILO benchmark corresponds to the median value in the group of countries 
assessed as ‘low vulnerable’ (regarding the structure of employment and poverty). Based on 2011 data 
from WHO (number of physicians, nursing and midwifery personnel per 10,000), the estimated median 
value is 41.1 per 10,000 poopulation when weighted by total population.  
Another way to look at it is to refer to population not covered due to a deficit from the supply side (see 
second part of example below). Then, the ILO staff access deficit indicator estimates the dimension of 
the overall performance of health-care delivery as a percentage of the population that has no access to 
health care if needed. This value is above the minimum set by WHO for primary care delivery, which is 23 
per 10,000.  
Professional staff includes physicians and nursing and midwifery personnel as defined by WHO. See 
Indicator definitions and metadata (http://apps.who.int/gho/indicatorregistry/App_Main/view_indicator.
aspx?iid=3105, accessed May 2014).

9  WHO benchmark: It has been estimated, in the World Health Report 2006, that countries with fewer than 

23 physicians, nurses and midwives per 10,000 population generally fail to achieve adequate coverage 
rates for selected primary health-care interventions as prioritized by the Millennium Development Goals 
framework (WHO Health Statistics 2012, pp. 82: http://www.who.int/gho/publications/world_health_
statistics/WHS2012_IndicatorCompendium.pdf, accessed May 2014). 

10  Coverage gap due to financial resources deficit based on median value in low vulnerability group of 

countries. The ILO financial deficit indicator follows the same principle as the access deficit indicator 
regarding total health spending (in US$ per capita and per year) except out-of-pocket payments. The 
relative median value in 2011 in group of countries assessed as ‘low vulnerable’ is estimated at 239 US$ 
per capita and per year.

11  According to the World Health Organization, ensuring access to the types of interventions and treatments 

needed to address MDGs 4, 5 and 6 requires on average “little more than US$ 60 per capita [annually] by 
2015”: WHO, The World Health Report: Health systems financing: The path to universal coverage, World 
Health Organization (Geneva, 2010).

12  Aggregate measures are weighted by total population (2012) from United Nations Population Division, UN 

World Population Prospects, 2012 Revision.

13  Example of calculation of the ILO Coverage gap due to health professional staff deficit using a relative 

benchmark.

Total of health professional staff [A = B + C]

Number of nursing and midwifery personnel [B]

Number of physicians [C]

Total population (in thousands) [D]

Number of health professional per 10 000 persons [F = A ÷ D × 10]

The ILO staff access deficit indicator  
[(benchmark-valuecountry X) ÷ benchmarck × 100]

If referring to population covered:

Total population covered if applying benchmark * (thousands)  
[E = A ÷ benchmark × 10]

Total population not covered due to health professional  
staff deficit (thousands) [F = D – E]

Percentage of total population not covered  
due to health professional staff deficit G = F ÷ D × 100

* Relative ILO benchmark: 41.1 professional health staff per 10,000 persons.

World Social Protection Report 2014/15 ocial protection policies play a critical role in realizing the 

human right to social security for all, reducing poverty and inequality, and 
promoting inclusive growth – by boosting human capital and productivity, 
and by supporting domestic demand and structural transformation of 
national economies. This ILO flagship report provides a global overview of 
the organization of social protection systems, their coverage and benefits, 
as well as public expenditures on social protection. 

The report follows a life-cycle approach, starting with social protection 
for children, followed by schemes for women and men in working age, 
and closing with pensions and other support for older persons. It also 
assesses progress towards universal coverage in health. The report 
further analyses trends and recent policies, such as the negative impacts 
of fiscal consolidation and adjustment measures, and urgently calls to 
expand social protection for crisis recovery, inclusive development and 
social justice. 

The World Social Protection Report 2014/15 includes valuable and 
comprehensive statistical annexes with the latest social protection data.
