I. Introduction

The  past  two  decades  have  witnessed  the 
emergence  of 
the  new  developmental 
phenomenon  of  urbanization.  Cities  are  not 
only  the  engines  of  economic  growth  but 
also  increasingly  spaces  of  shared  social, 
cultural  and  economic  experiences  (United 
Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-
Habitat),  2005).  Urbanization  is  synonymous 
to most people in the developing world with 
job creation and poverty reduction. Yet while 
some cities across the world have managed to 
benefit from urbanization as a developmental 
tool  by  applying  the  right  policies,  others 
have merely moved poverty to urban areas. In 
addition,  various  examples  from  around  the 
world  demonstrate  that  being  a  developed 
country 
is  not  a  prerequisite  for  sound 
urbanization  that  contributes  to  economic 
development.

Urbanization  has  accompanied  large-scale 
improvements in some developing countries 
towards the Millennium Development Goals. 
The  most  important  change  has  been  the 
eradication of extreme poverty in rural areas, 
for  instance  in  China.  Such  progress  has 
depended  primarily  on  the  role  of  cities  in 
employment  generation  and  their  ability  to 
provide  basic  services  such  as  water,  health 
and sanitation for the masses at a lower cost 
than in rural areas.

The  next  wave  of  urbanization  represents 
an  opportunity  to  meet  the  Millennium 
Development  Goals  and  raise  people  out 
of  poverty.  Moving  to  cities  may  provide 
employment,  health  and  sanitation  all  at 
once  to  citizens  of  developing  countries. 
Despite  this,  urbanization  is  a  core  concern 
that developing countries struggle with, with 
many common issues. Developing countries 
need to find ways to accommodate growing 
demands  on  their  cities  to  ensure  that  the 
social,  cultural  and  environmental  needs  of 
their citizens are met. Cities need to envisage 
policies  that  bridge  growing  urban  divides 
that  translate  not  only  into  unfair  economic 
opportunities  but  also  unfair  access  to 

services. Cities should aim to become shared 
spheres of prosperity.

issues.  Cities  account 

Urbanization is a key environmental issue as 
well. The rapid pace at which urbanization is 
taking place in the developing world has an 
impact  on  climate  change  and  other  global 
environmental 
for 
more  than  two-thirds  of  the  global  energy 
demand  and  result  in  up  to  80  per  cent 
of  global  greenhouse  gas  emissions.  The 
urban  planning  and 
investment  choices 
that  a  few  large  developing  countries  will 
make  therefore  represent  one  of  the  most 
important  environmental 
the 
twenty-first century. Entire new industries are 
forming  with  the  aim  of  switching  to  clean 
and  renewable  energies  and  managing  the 
world’s resources in a more efficient manner, 
primarily  in  developed  countries  but  also  in 
the developing world. 

issues  of 

In  recent  years,  sustainable  urbanization 
has  become  a  very  popular  topic.  Several 
conferences  at  international,  regional  and 
local 
levels  have  periodically  discussed 
urbanization  issues  in  detail.  Debate  on  the 
topic has already reached a level of maturity 
whereby  tools,  resources  and  applications 
are  abundant  worldwide.

This  report  aims  to  contribute  to  the  sus-

ing the specific role of science, technology 
and innovation. It is based on literature re-
view and an analysis of cities in developed 
and  developing  countries  that  provide  ex-
amples  that  can  be  reapplied  elsewhere. 
The report provides a fresh perspective on 
the  discussion  on  sustainable  urbaniza-

studies  from  around  the  world. The  report 
identifies  key  sectoral  planning  challenges 
posed by rapid urbanization, particularly in

decision makers for addressing these chal-

The  publication  draws  on  lessons  learned 
from panels organized by the United Nations 
Commission  on  Science  and  Technology 
for  Development  on  the  topic  of  science, 
technology  and  innovation  for  sustainable 
cities and peri-urban communities during its 
2012–2013 intersessional panel, held in Lima, 
Peru in January 2013, and its sixteenth session, 
held in Geneva, Switzerland in June 2013.

II. a. Trends of urbanization

to 

According 
the  world  development 
indicators of the World Bank, people living in 
urban areas represented 52.6 per cent of the 
world’s population in 2012. It is estimated that 
by 2050 the number of inhabitants of urban 
areas will increase from the current 3.5 billion 
to  6.2  billion,  which  will  approximately 
constitute more than two-thirds of the global 
population.  The  unprecedented  pace  of 
urbanization  in  developing  countries,  where 
more  than  90  per  cent  of  urban  population 

growth will occur over the next 30 years, is the 
main driver of this trend. Most of this growth 
will be attributed to mid-size towns.

Table  1  shows  urbanization 
trends  by 
development  group.  The  growth  of  urban 
areas  until  2050  will  primarily  take  place  in 
developing  Asia,  Africa  and  Latin  America. 
Rural areas of both developed and developing 
regions will stagnate and urban populations 
of  developed  regions  will  incur  a  very  small 
increase. 
is  expected  that  the  urban 
population of sub-Saharan Africa will double, 
to reach almost 600 million by 2030.

Science, Technology and Innovation for Sustainable Urbanization

Cities generate four-fifths of the global gross 
domestic  product  with  just  over  half  of  the 
world’s population, on 2 per cent of the earth’s 
surface (Department of Economic and Social 
Affairs – Population Division, 2012). Most new 
jobs  are  created  in  cities;  60  per  cent  of  the 
increase in the global gross domestic product 
between 2010 and 2025 is expected to come 
from 600 cities (Gapper, 2012).

in 

Urbanization 
the  developing  world 
has  been  a  major  contributor  to  progress 
towards  attaining  some  of  the  Millennium 
Development Goals, such as those related to 
poverty,  sanitation  and  health.  This  is  to  be 
expected,  given  that  on  average  a  10  per 
cent increase in a country’s urban population 
results  in  a  30  per  cent  increase  in  that 
country’s  per  capita  output.  In  addition,  per 
capita incomes are almost four times higher 
in majority-urban countries in comparison to 
majority-rural countries (Glaeser, 2011). 

In  addition  to  their  role  in  alleviating  poverty 
through  their  economic  dynamism,  cities  also 
make  public  services  more  accessible  (World 
Bank  and  International  Monetary  Fund,  2013). 
Due  to  the  economies  of  scale  achieved 
through  their  higher  density,  it  is  less  costly 
to  provide  piped  water,  sanitation,  education 
and  health  care  services  in  urban  areas.  The 
provision of such services is directly linked to the 
Millennium  Development  Goals.  For  instance, 
in  sub-Saharan  Africa,  urbanization  facilitated 
half of the decline in poverty. In addition, nearly 
30  per  cent  of  improvements  on  target  7.C1 
was achieved by urbanization (World Bank and 
International Monetary Fund, 2013).

Growing urban divides in all spheres 

Urbanization has raised the standard of living for 
many  by  offering  employment  opportunities 
and  better  public  services.  However,  it  also 
comes with important challenges, particularly 
for developing countries. In many parts of the 
world,  urbanization  has  not  taken  place  in  a 
socially  inclusive  manner.  Many  developing 
countries  have  not  been  able  to  predict  and 

requirements 

prepare  for  the  rapid  pace  of  urbanization 
that  is  in  progress.  Even  where  the  trend  is 
predictable,  cities  are  unable  to  address  the 
needs  of  growing  populations  and  cope 
with  surging 
for  housing, 
physical  infrastructure,  including  roads  and 
telecommunications  technologies,  and  social 
services,  such  as  health  and  education.  The 
continuation  of  current  urbanization  patterns 
in  the  developing  world  could  lead  to  urban 
decay  and  a  low  quality  of  life,  adversely 
affecting the economic growth of developing 
countries.

Although urbanization itself is not the cause of 
poverty, unplanned urbanization is resulting in 
the shift of poverty to urban areas in developing 
countries. In 2012, urban poverty was already 
a  serious  issue:  525  million  urban  inhabitants 
lived  on  under  $1  per  day,  while  1.2  billion 
citizens lived on under $2 per day. The growth 
of  slums  has  been  inevitable,  representing 
38  per  cent  of  urban  growth  around  the 
world and three-quarters of urban population 
growth in sub-Saharan Africa. The global slum 
population  has  been  growing  by  more  than 
20 million additional slum dwellers per year and 
will reach a projected total of 1.4 billion in 2020. 
In Africa, more than half of urban citizens live in 
informal settlements, where the water supply 
and sanitation are severely inadequate. Climate 
change is exacerbating the risk of disasters for 
populations living in such inadequate shelters. 

The growth of slums has a direct impact on the 
attainment  of  the  Millennium  Development 
Goals  in  cities.  In  2007–2008,  UN-Habitat, 
the  United  Nations  Human  Settlements 
Programme, measured indicators of progress 
towards 
the  Millennium  Development 
Goals  in  slums  and  other  areas  of  200  cities 
globally.  The  study 
indicated  that  slum 
dwellers die earlier, experience more hunger, 
are  less  educated,  have  fewer  chances  for 
employment  and  suffer  more  ill  health  than 
the rest of the urban population.

New York City: Measuring
sustainability

New York  City  has  launched  PlaNYC,  a  comprehensive 
agenda  that  includes  long-term  targets  for  enhanc-
ing  infrastructure,  the  environment,  quality  of  life  and 
the  economy  to  accommodate  an  additional  1  million 
people  until  2030.  PlaNYC  measures  29  sustainability 
indicators in categories including housing, parks, public 
transport, water supply, energy eﬃciency and air quality 
through  a  dedicated  oﬃce  of  long-term  planning  and 
sustainability.

or  unsustainable  in  the  future  and  how 
to  address  the  issue.  There  is  no  generally 
agreed common definition of sustainability or 
sustainable urbanization. However, there is a 
growing set of areas and actions that together 
constitute  the  benchmarks  for  sustainable 
urbanization.  The  definition  continues  to 
evolve and higher standards are set.

In 

addition, 

The  economic,  social  and  environmental 
effects  of  uncontrolled  rapid  urbanization 
are  increasing  awareness  of  the  need  for 
sustainable practices. Large-scale events such 
as  the  Olympics  are  increasingly  evaluated 
on whether they incorporate legacy projects 
that plan the reuse of facilities following the 
event. New ecological cities are planned and 
constructed  that  rely  fully  on  sustainable 
technologies. 
are 
increasingly setting goals and measuring their 
sustainability by using indicators such as the 
availability of shelter and safe drinking water, 
urban  density,  public  space  as  a  percentage 
of urban area, energy efficiency of buildings, 
share  of  renewable  energy  sources,  access 
and  proximity  to  mass  transit,  wastewater 
treatment,  number  of  road  traffic  fatalities, 
solid waste management and recycling (UN-
Habitat, 2012c). box 1 presents an example of 
measuring sustainability in the United States 
of America.

cities 

The  definition  of  sustainability  in  the  urban 
context can be divided into the subsections 
of smart, environmentally friendly, prosperous 
and socially inclusive cities, as follows:

•  Smart  cities  cover  the  needs  of  their 
citizens adequately. They offer high-quality 

services,  including  mobility,  habitat  and 
public space. 

•  Environmentally friendly cities manage their 
resources efficiently. They minimize waste 
and  promote  environmental  awareness 
among  citizens  and  environmentally 
friendly  buildings 
construction 
materials to reduce energy consumption. 

and 

tapping 

•  Prosperous  cities  maximize  economic 
opportunities  by 
the 
competitive advantages of their locations, 
not  only  at  the  city  level  but  beyond, 
covering  the  region,  in  order  to  attract 
entrepreneurship  and  new  economic 
activity. 

into 

•  Socially  inclusive  cities  strive  to  increase 
quality  of  life  for  all  citizens  regardless  of 
income levels, through increasing safety by 
addressing  crime,  stimulating  economic 
opportunities for the poor and integrating 
informal areas, and practising governance 
that involves the public in decision-making 
structures.

and 

land 

Sustainable  urbanization  can  thus  cover 
all  actions  that  lead  to  a  more  efficient 
management  of 
resources, 
improved  mobility,  economic  dynamism, 
higher environmental quality, safety, security, 
access to urban services and social cohesion. 
Generally,  the  relevant 
literature  accepts 
sustainable  cities  as  those  that  have  sound 
spatial  plans  that  address  the  needs  of  their 
population,  ensure  the  circulation  of  people 
through sound mobility systems and use their 
resources  efficiently,  and  even  manage  to 
build a circular economy through means such 
as recycling. This definition may be seen as the 
narrow definition of sustainable urbanization. 
In the broader sense, sustainable urbanization 
also  addresses  social  policies,  including  for 
reducing  crime  and  ensuring  social  justice, 
funding  models  and  governance  structures. 
Since science, technology and innovation are 
more relevant to and have a stronger impact 
on sectors included in the narrow definition 
of  sustainable  urbanization,  this  report  will 
cover their role accordingly.

Science, Technology and Innovation for Sustainable Urbanization

Sustainable  urbanization  comes  at  a  cost.  In 
the next 10 years, more than $10 trillion will 
need to be invested in urban infrastructure in 
Asia and Latin America (Economic and Social 
Commission  for  Asia  and  the  Pacific  et  al., 
2011). In the period until 2030, twenty times 
the infrastructure capacity added during the 
past  decade  is  needed  for  roads  and  public 
transport  across  the  world.  The  estimated 
rate  of  urbanization  in  China  and  India  until 
2050, outlined in box 2, attests to the scale of 
investments required to address the needs of 
growing urban populations in terms of jobs, 
housing,  basic  services  and  infrastructure. 
Furthermore,  urban  population  growth 
and  steadily  rising  incomes  result  in  higher 
resource  consumption.  Cities  around  the 
world, especially rapidly growing cities in Asia, 
Africa and Latin America, need to find ways to 
delink urban economic growth from resource 
consumption. Urbanization is creating cross-
sectoral  governance  challenges,

Urbanization in the developing world is led by China and India. The urban population of China is expected to increase from 
just above 10 per cent in 1950 to almost 80 per cent in 2050. In India, urbanization has been slower but will accelerate after 
2020 to pass the 50 per cent threshold in 2050. Urbanization will continue to drive increases in national income in both 
countries. For instance, 70 per cent of all new jobs in India will be created in urban areas, with twice the productivity level 
of equivalent jobs in rural areas. Cities will drive social inclusion as well since public infrastructure, such as for water and 
sanitation, is more aﬀordable in urban areas than in sparsely populated areas.

cities, along with other components such as 
leadership, urban governance, regulation and 
financing.

This report, which is part of the UNCTAD series 
on  current  studies  on  science,  technology 
and innovation, focuses on their specific role 
in bringing about sustainable urbanization in 
developing countries and how to strengthen 
this  role.  Therefore,  for  the  purposes  of  this 
report,  sustainability  refers  to  all  practices 
based on science, technology and innovation 
that  lead  to  an  improved  quality  of  life  for 
urban citizens. 

II. c. Role of science,  

 
  technology and innovation  
  in the urban context

 

Science,  technology  and  innovation  are  key 
elements  of  sustainable  urbanization  and 
will  play  a  growing  role  as  such.  Their  use 
may  not  solve  all  urbanization  problems, 
yet  can  provide  a  multitude  of  solutions 
that  can  be  leveraged  by  cities.  The  use 
of  science,  technology  and  innovation  in 
the  urban  context  implies  the  application 
of  both  high  and 
low  technology  and 
innovative  approaches  to  urban  planning 
and 
Science, 
technology  and  innovation  approaches  are 
widely  available  for  cities  to  draw  upon,  yet 
cities  are  complex  structures  that  require 
integrated  responses  to  their  problems  and 
there  are  sometimes  difficulties  related  to 
such integration.

innovation. 

Although  this  report  separately  analyses 
the  various  sectors  that  are  important  for 
sustainable  urbanization,  it  is  necessary  for 
urban  planners  and  managers  to  address 
issues  with  an  intersectoral  mindset.  Urban 
systems  need  to  be  designed  with  multiple 
uses 
in  mind.  Science,  technology  and 
innovation  offer  a  range  of  related  options, 
including  high  technology,  low  technology 
and 
innovative  governance.  Combining 
science, technology and innovation to solve 
urban problems is often contextual, although 
there  are  several  good  practices  to  draw 
upon from cities across the globe.

Science, 
innovation 
contribute  to  sustainable  urbanization  in 
a  variety  of  ways,  including  with  regard 
in  spatial  planning, 
to  new  capabilities

enhancing 
cooperation  between  urban  departments, 
optimizing mobility and enabling sustainable 
resource management. A science, technology 
and innovation-oriented mindset also brings 
about 
in 
urban  governance,  such  as  for  participatory 
budgeting  and  regional  urban  planning. 
Finally,  science,  technology  and  innovation 
contribute  to  social  inclusion  by  improving 
the  tools  available  to  urban  planners  to 
respond  to  the  needs  of  excluded  groups 
and to increase sensitivity to gender equality.

innovative  models  of  thinking 

Each urban setting faces different challenges 
and has different technology needs. In some 
cases, 
inexpensive  and  readily  available 
technologies  may  be  the  best  solution  to 
urban  problems.  For  example,  intermodal 
transport  services  can  be  designed  without 
necessarily 
expensive  high-
technology  means  of  transport.  Promoting 
bicycles,  an  affordable,  healthy,  clean  and 
energy-efficient technology, may be the best 
option to improve mobility in many cities, for 
both younger and older citizens. 

requiring 

Furthermore, innovation, which in the urban 
context  may  refer  to  any  new  method, 
business  model,  policy,  institutional  design 
or regulation, could meet the needs of urban 
populations in a more efficient, effective and 
sustainable way. For instance, improved rules 
or legislation, as well as improved institutions, 
stakeholder  participation  models  and  new 
means of delivering services, can contribute 
to  sustainable  urbanization.  As  a  final  point, 
high technology, low technology and urban 
innovation can also be integrated to address 
a specific urban issue in harmony.

II. d. Cities as systems

technologies  work 

A  sociotechnical  system  is  the  way  humans 
and 
to 
produce  outcomes.  The  answers  to  societal 
challenges  cannot  be  expected  to  come 
from technologies alone but rather from how 

together 

8

Science, Technology and Innovation for Sustainable Urbanization

technologies are developed and used in the 
overall  development  process.  For  example, 
a  transportation  system  is  not  only  vehicles 
and roadways but also how people drive, ride, 
build and maintain them. The city itself can be 
viewed  as  a  complex  sociotechnical  system 
that  addresses  the  needs  of  densely  settled 
communities.  Science, 
technology  and 
innovation approaches may therefore be seen 
not  merely  as  technologies  but  within  the 
context of the urban sociotechnical system. 
Cities  are  ultimately  places  where  humans 
live  and  must  therefore  address  human 
needs  and  aspirations.  When  envisaging 
science,  technology  and 
for 
cities,  it  is  necessary  to  ensure  harmony 
between  engineered  systems  and  design 
and  architectural  concerns.  For  example, 
when  planning  roads  with  a  technocratic 
mindset,  one  might  achieve  perfection  in 
terms of engineering, yet actually destroy the 
fabric of a city as a place where people enjoy 
living, as is often true in the use of elevated 
highways. Cities provide science, technology 
and 
innovation  with  an  opportunity  to 
produce  benefits  for  large  populations,  if 
the related solutions are applied to address 
human needs.

innovation 

Science,  technology  and  innovation  are  key 
ingredients  for  sustainable  urbanization  in 
developing countries, yet not the only ones, 
and have prerequisites to be effective, such as 
institutional and regulatory reform, socially in-
clusive policymaking, the availability of funds 
and the establishment of partnerships. Cities 
need to be viewed as complete sociotechni-
cal  systems  in  order  for  science,  technology 
and innovation-related solutions to be effec-

tive,  and  such  solutions  will  be  ineffective  if 
other policies do not complement them. Sci-
ence,  technology  and  innovation  drive  so-
ciotechnical change, yet city leaders need to 
increase the awareness of citizens to the ur-
gency of sociotechnical change for their own 
well-being and quality of life. Such solutions 
also need to be accompanied by leadership, 
a supportive regulatory environment, educa-
tion and citizen participation. One simple way 
to explain the positioning of science, technol-
ogy and innovation as part of a comprehen-
sive framework of policies leading to sustain-
able urbanization is through the example of 
bicycle-sharing programmes. Such initiatives 
cannot  succeed  without  dedicated  lanes, 
laws that clarify priorities in traffic and, most 
importantly, education and awareness-raising 
so that citizens no longer rely on their auto-
mobiles for all travel.

Within an urban sociotechnical system, more 
positive  outcomes  may  be  achieved  if  cities 
are  designed  with  an  intersectoral  mindset, 
for  instance  when  addressing  energy,  water 
and  public  health  in  an  integrated  manner. 
In  some  cases,  the  best  application  of 
science,  technology  and  innovation  may  be 
a  combination  of  low  and  high  technology 
in  one  package  and 
is  necessary  for 
city  management  to  find  an  appropriate 
balance.  For  example,  building  design, 
energy consumption and mobility are closely 
interlinked;  taller  buildings  may  negatively 
affect  exposure  to  sunlight,  reducing  the 
potential for the use of solar panels, and street 
width  affects  the  capacity  to  accommodate 
multiple  modes  of  transport,  as  well  as  the 
architecture of buildings.

issues such as urban sprawl, traffic congestion

is not an exhaustive list but rather a selection 
of  highly  relevant  uses,  to  draw  attention 
to  the  potential  of  science,  technology 
and  innovation.  Several  cities  around  the

technology  and  governance  models 
in 
sectors such as spatial planning and mobility 
to address these complex challenges.

III. a. Density, land use and  

  spatial planning

 

long-term  spatial  planning  and 

This  report  first  considers  spatial  planning 
in  its  sectoral  analysis  of  sustainable  urban 
development  as  it  is  a  cross-cutting  theme 
that  affects  all  other  sectors.  Urbanization 
in  developing  countries  takes  place  with 
little 
is 
driven  by 
short-term  profitability 
expectations  of  the  real-estate  sector.  Even 
planned development strategies sometimes 
underestimate the pace of urbanization. For 
example, the 1995 plan for Shanghai, China 
estimated a population of 15 million by 2020, 
yet  the  city  had  already  reached  16  million 
inhabitants in 2000. 

the 

Current research in urban planning promotes 
more  compact  and  dense  spatial  planning 
for  cities.  There  are  several  ways  in  which 
increasing density may be beneficial for cities 
with  growing  populations.  The  following 
section  discusses  alternatives  for  how  to 
achieve this.

Urban sprawl and its effects

Unplanned  urbanization  often  results 
in 
urban  sprawl,  which  is  commonly  defined 

transport  and  utilities 

as  single-use  low-density  urbanization  and 
has  several  negative  dimensions.  Whereas 
urban sprawl was previously associated with 
North American cities, it is rapidly extending 
to  cities  across 
the  developing  world 
(Economic  and  Social  Commission  for  Asia 
and  the  Pacific  et  al.,  2011).  The  density  of 
urban areas in terms of number of people per 
hectare  is  decreasing  across  the  world  due 
to uncontrolled urban sprawl. Lower density 
makes  it  more  challenging  and  expensive 
to  provide  adequate  public  services  such 
as 
(UN-Habitat, 
2012c).  Unplanned  urbanization  results  in 
investments  that  dictate  future  urban  land 
and  resource  consumption  patterns.  It  is 
costly to replace such investments with more 
sustainable infrastructure later on since they 
lock  in  the  options  of  urban  planners  (UN-
Habitat, 2012c).
As a result of unplanned urbanization, millions 
of people live in informal settlements on the 
periphery  of  cities  without  access  to  basic 
services, water and sanitation due to the lack 
of funds to carry out important infrastructure 
projects. For example, large shortfalls in water 
supply  have  increasingly  been  experienced 
in  Lagos,  Nigeria,  where  official  supplies 
barely meet half the level of demand due to 
population growth, insufficient infrastructure, 
illegal 
connections,  poor  maintenance 
and  inadequate  access  to  limited  supplies 
(Worldwatch Institute, 2007). 
Urban 
the 
environment  and  affecting  the  livelihood 
of  communities  located  in  the  immediate 
vicinity  of  cities  by  covering  land  that  could 
otherwise be utilized for agriculture, tourism or 
recreational activities. For example, significant 
damage has been caused to environmentally 
sensitive  areas  around  the  following  cities: 
São Paulo, Brazil; San José, Costa Rica; Panama 
City,  Panama;  and  Caracas,  the  Bolivarian 
Republic  of Venezuela  (Economic  and  Social

Science, technology and innovation for 
spatial planning

Cities can accommodate growing populations 
in  accordance  with  their  land  use,  spatial 
design  and  density  plans  by  combining 
several 
instruments.  Table  2 
provides examples of regulatory instruments 
for  land  use  and  spatial  planning  that  can 
contribute to sustainable growth in cities.

regulatory 

Information  and  communications  technolo-
gies play a key role in enabling and enforcing 
regulatory measures such as the above for the 
spatial planning of urban areas. For example, 
city  planners  can  use  simulation,  modelling 
and  visualization  technologies  to  aid  long-
term  planning  and 
investment  decisions 
(Dodgson  and  Gann,  2011).  Geospatial  tools 
can  identify  infill  zones  such  as  abandoned 
land or buildings that are suitable for redevel-

Table 2.  Regulatory instruments for land use and spatial planning

Urban growth boundaries

Establishing clear limits to any form of building development around cities to limit 
urban sprawl; creating green corridors that protect existing ecosystems.

Land-use regulation

Introducing zoning regulation that prioritizes the development of previously 
developed – brownfield – land in the inner city over greenfield development at 
a citywide level.
Closely linked to infill development, which refers to new construction within 
existing urban areas as opposed to urban expansion.

Promotion of mixed-use 
settlements

Designing neighbourhoods that include residential, service and local 
employment elements and are adequately covered in terms of basic services and 
infrastructure.

Density regulation

Density bonus

Providing minimum rather than maximum density standards; establishing clear 
density standards at a citywide level, such as floor area ratios,2 in support of 
compact city development with a hierarchy of higher-density mixed-use clusters 
around public transport nodes.

Providing development bonuses that allow increased development rights, for 
example extra floor area with respect to standard planning regulations, for green 
projects that support citywide and local sustainability.

Special planning powers

Establishing urban development corporations or urban regeneration companies to 
promote and enable green projects.

Vehicle and traffic regulation

Introducing regulation for vehicle types, emission standards, speed limits and road 
space allocation that favours green transport, especially green public transport.

Parking standards

Providing maximum rather than minimum parking standards; reducing 
private automobile parking standards to a minimum, for example less than 
one automobile per household, especially in areas of high public transport 
accessibility.

Car-free developments

Providing planning incentives for car-free developments in higher-density areas 
with high public transport accessibility.

Minimum emission 
standards

Regulating minimum carbon-emission and energy-efficiency standards at the local 
level for buildings and vehicles.

The ﬂoor area ratio is the most common density measure for planning purposes and is calculated by adding all the area of residential 
and business ﬂoor spaces and dividing it by the entire area of the development site (United Nations Environment Programme, 2011).

Box 3.  Oman: Use of information and communications technologies for
 

spatial planning

Information and communications technologies are increasingly being used in the form of geospatial applications in 
urban areas. Oman, in partnership with the International Society of City and Regional Planners, is developing a plan-
ning information system as part of its national spatial strategy. The system will become the central hub for all types 
of  spatial  data  in  the  country,  supplied  by  data  from  multiple  national  institutions.  It  will  be  complemented  by  a 
capacity-building programme in order that the system may be managed locally. Data will be linked to a map and the 
system will help access information on serviced land in Oman, such as with regard to utility networks, by overlaying 
different types of data.

opment and plan for their reallocation. Geo-
spatial data can be used for scenario planning 
to  envision  future  urban  development  that 
is consistent with a city’s historic and current 
development path. Geospatial tools can also 
combine  statistical  information  with  satel-
lite maps to run analyses such as on poverty 
targeting,  urban  infrastructure  and  transport 
planning  and  socioeconomic  analyses  such 
as  crime  statistics  and  the  tracking  of  illegal 
settlements  (UNCTAD,  2012a).  In  Bangkok, 
Thailand spatial data is used to analyse flood 
risks  and  improve  the  security  of  tenure  in 
informal  settlements.  box  3  provides  an  ex-
ample of the use of information and commu-
nications technologies for spatial planning in 
Oman.

Policy considerations

Developing spatial plans in the early phases 
of  urbanization  based  on  the  political 
consensus  of  stakeholders,  support  from 
the  private  sector  and  outside  assistance 
or  investment  can  prevent  the  later  waste 
of  financial  resources.  Spatial  plans  are 
the  strategic  decisions  of  cities  on  spatial 
design  and  density  that  take  into  account 
population  growth  estimates,  topographic 
characteristics and the capacity to implement 
related changes (UN-Habitat, 2012c). 

spatial  design  options 

The  main 
to 
accommodate  population  growth  are  as 
follows:

• 

Increasing density

•  Extending the city

•  Multiplying  nodes  by  building  satellite 

towns 

Spatial  planning  can  optimize  the  density 
of  cities  according  to  urban  development 
goals and enable public services that achieve 
economies of scale. Increasing urban density 
can  save  costs  arising  from  the  provision 
of  basic  services  to  scarcely  inhabited  and 
extended city outskirts. It can also be beneficial 
in terms of encouraging public transport. For 
example, high density in central Hong Kong 
(China)  allows  85  per  cent  of  all  trips  to  be 
made by using public transport (UN-Habitat, 
2012c).

Increasing  density  can  be  a  solution  for 
physical  limitations  on  urban  growth,  as  is 
often  seen  in  city-States  such  as  Singapore 
or  cities  of  small  island  developing  States. 
Academic  research  has  shown  that  higher 
population  density  in  cities  leads  to  more 
face-to-face  interactions  between  citizens, 
which results in a superlinear acceleration of 
innovation, wealth creation and productivity. 
At  the  same  time,  too  much  density  is  also 
not advisable since it can result in the overuse 
of  public  infrastructure  that  will  depreciate 
early.  Research  in  247  large  counties  in  the 
United States identified that public spending 
first  decreases  with  higher  density  but  can 
increase  after  a  tipping  point  (UN-Habitat, 
2012c).

Densification  policies  can  be  coupled  with 
innovative  models  of  urban  development. 
On  high-value  public  land  that  is  covered 
by slums, local governments can implement

Innovative spatial design strategies in practice

Portland,  United  States,  is  a  city  that  experiences  relatively  stable  population  growth  and  its  spatial  design  was 
therefore  based  on  increasing  density. The  city  established  an  urban  growth  boundary  and  prioritized  infill  de-
velopment by regenerating brownfield areas and replacing degraded buildings with new ones that had a higher 
capacity. 

Cape Town, South Africa, adopted a densification policy in February 2012 in order to address challenges of rapid 
low-density development such as long travel distances, loss of agricultural land and operational inefficiencies (City 
of Cape Town, 2012). The policy supports the increase of average gross density through the subdivision or consoli-
dation of plots, in order to make room for redevelopment at higher densities. Objectives include the efficient use 
of infrastructure, development of public transport, protection of the environment, revitalization of city life through 
mixed land uses and the development of attractive and safe urban environments.

If a city grows faster than 1 to 2 per cent per year, infill development may not be sufficient and extending the city at 
its fringes may be required. The Commissioners’ Plan of 1811, the original design plan for the streets of Manhattan, 
was a far-sighted extension plan that foresaw such gradual expansion. 

For cities with even higher growth rates, establishing satellite towns in the vicinity of major cities may be an ap-
propriate solution, as envisaged in the Comprehensive Plan 1999–2010 of Shanghai, which includes nine satellite 
towns that will receive migration from rural areas. Moreover, building strong links between cities within a region, 
as occurs in Seoul, Republic of Korea, can lead to new possibilities for cooperation such as joint financing, sharing 
infrastructure with other towns and joint regional governance mechanisms to manage transport, waste and water 
resources.

slum-upgrading programmes for the benefit 
of  all  stakeholders.  They  can  propose 
improved  housing  for  occupants  of  slums 
in higher modern buildings on parts of the 
same land. The private sector can construct 
these  buildings  free  of  cost  in  return  for 
development 
in  other  zones  of 
the  city.  As  a  result,  the  city  can  upgrade 
infrastructure  at  no  cost,  optimize  land  use 
and create open space on valuable land with 
the  help  of  vertical  resettlement  (Gill  and 
Bhide, 2012).

rights 

Spatial plans can include regional integration 
aspects.  Cities  are  located  in  regions  and 
should  undertake  metropolitan  strategic 
planning  for  integration  with  their  regions 
and  not  only  in  the  jurisdiction  area  of  the 
metropolitan  zone  to  which  they  belong. 
Various  spatial  design  strategies  can  be 
implemented  depending  on  the  needs 
of  the  specific  urban  area.  box  4  provides 
examples  of  cities  that  have  implemented 
innovative spatial design strategies.

dependence 

transport. Cities can be designed by locating 
mixed-use  developments  and 
jobs  near 
intermodal  public  transport  connections, 
thereby  minimizing 
on 
automobiles  and  reducing  the  distance  that 
people need to travel. Spatial design should 
plan for integrating the incoming population 
into the public transport system. Each mode 
of  public  transport  requires  a  minimum 
density  to  be  economical,  and  the  choice 
between  buses,  trams  and  light  rail  may  be 
identified accordingly. For example, a density 
of  20  persons  per  hectare  generally  makes 
urban  zones  dependent  on  automobiles.  As 
of  60  persons  per  hectare  public  transport 
starts to be economical and as of 150 persons 
per  hectare  walking  and  bicycling  may  be 
considered practical transport modes.

in  the  previous  section,  in  low-density  cities 
it  is  more  difficult  to  introduce  cost-efficient 
public  transport  due  to  increased  distances 
and a decreased number of people per trip. It 
takes years to reverse transport strategies that

the cost and scale of underlying investments.

Kenya,  where  only  1  in  7  inhabitants  has  an

transport mode, as they can carry only 2,000 
people per hour on a 3.5 metre-wide lane in 
the city, in comparison with 20,000 people via 
a  single-lane  bus  rapid  transit  system  (Asian 
Development  Bank  and  German  Agency  for 
International Cooperation, 2011).

Traffic congestion causes economic damage 
to  cities.  For  example,  Bangkok  is  losing 
6  per  cent  of  its  gross  domestic  product  to 
congestion,  a  percentage  comparable  to 
the tourism sector of the city, which produces 
7  per  cent  of  the  gross  domestic  product. 
In  Mexico  City,  Mexico  the  average  daily 
commute  time  is  2.5  hours,  creating  a  loss 
of  2.6  per  cent  of  gross  domestic  product 
(Glaeser, 2011). The cost of traffic congestion 
is 10 per cent of the gross domestic product 
of  Lima,  Peru  and  3.4  per  cent  of  the  gross 
domestic product of Buenos Aires, Argentina 
(Economic and Social Commission for Asia and 
the Pacific et al., 2011). Most of this economic 
loss comes from the value of the time lost by 
drivers and passengers. Moreover, congestion 
worsens  carbon  emissions  and  air  pollution, 
resulting in negative effects on health.

Automobile travel requires vast land for roads 
and  parking  areas.  New  sprawling  suburbs 
have high infrastructure costs and cause the 
loss of productive agricultural land as well as 
the loss of urban land to asphalt. Due to their 
hard surfaces, roads also make the absorption 
of storm-water more difficult.

While fossil-fuel powered automobile travel is 
increasingly becoming less sustainable, public 
transport is also facing the challenge of lack of 
interest. In particular, public transport projects 
that are undertaken without sufficient public 
consultation  are  likely  to  misinterpret  local 
demand on transit routes. At the same time, 
despite its drawbacks, automobile ownership 
is continuously increasing. The global private 
automobile  fleet  is  expected  to  grow  from 
1  billion  in  2002  to  2  billion  in  2022,  mainly 
driven by motorization in Asia. In Delhi, India, 
it  is  estimated  that  the  number  of  vehicles 
in 2030 will be five times that of 1990 levels 
(Asian  Development  Bank  and  German 
Agency for International Cooperation, 2011). 
Automobiles are seen as a status symbol that 
ensures  convenience  and  personal  freedom 
of travel and citizens are biased towards using 
this mode of transport.

Science, technology and innovation for 
avoiding congestion and improving 
urban mobility

Mobility  solutions  should  not  only  focus  on 
supplying  infrastructure  but  on  answering 
the  demand  for  infrastructure.  They  should 
be centred on the movement of people and 
goods  instead  of  the  movement  of  vehicles 
and  deal  with  the  causes  of  mobility  issues 
rather  than  merely  the  symptoms.  They  are 
thus  directly  linked  to  spatial  planning,  as 
spatial  plans  dictate  mobility  options  and 
whether  or  not  cities  may  be  walkable. 
Spatial  planning  that  takes  the  needs  of 
urban  transport 
from 
the  beginning  is  a  key  factor  in  helping 
to  prioritize  public  transport.  Cities  can 
make  streets  more  walkable  for  pedestrians 
through the provision of dedicated lanes and 
suitable  street  crossings  and  by  minimizing 
pedestrian  bridges. 
In  addition,  bicycling 
may  be  encouraged  through  the  provision 

into  consideration 

14

Science, Technology and Innovation for Sustainable Urbanization

of  dedicated  lanes  and  low-velocity  streets. 
Ultimately,  mobility  issues  cannot  be  solved 
only  by  science,  technology  and  innovation. 
Social  aspects  and  driver  education  need  to 
be combined with technological solutions. 

Cities can make use of technology to switch to 
cleaner fuels in transport vehicles, implement 
various public transport systems and enable 
regulatory measures that control and improve 
the flow of traffic. Although there are a large 
variety of science, technology and innovation 
solutions  that  can  address  congestion  and 
high levels of fuel consumption, many are not 
feasible  for  implementation  in  developing 
countries  due  to  their  cost.  It  is  therefore 
imperative  for  cities  in  developing  countries 
to  integrate  high  and  low  technology  to 
provide mobility solutions for citizens. 

Bus rapid transit has lately emerged as a popular 
urban transit solution and is being introduced 
across  the  world,  including  in  cities  of  least 
developed countries, with successful results in 
reducing  congestion,  air  pollution  and  travel 
time, as shown by the examples in box 5. Bus 
rapid  transit  is  a  dedicated-lane  bus  system 
with  signal  priority  at  intersections,  prepaid 
fares  and  fast-boarding  platforms.  While  bus 
rapid  transit  is  a  relatively  low-cost  method 
of  providing  public  transport,  it  needs  to  be 

viewed in the larger context of urban mobility, 
ensuring the development of infrastructure for 
bicycles and pedestrians, as well as integration 
with other means of public transport.

80  per  cent  accuracy.  Providing  data  on  the 
impact  of  journeys  to  urban  citizens  allows 
them  to  adjust  their  mobility  choices.  In 
addition,  information  and  communications 
technologies can analyse route patterns in new 
ways  so  that  bottlenecks  can  be  addressed 
through  the  most  efficient  investments  in 
public  transport.  For  example,  information 
and communications technologies are key to 
understanding the reasons behind phantom 
traffic jams, through which a small disturbance 
in  the  flow  of  vehicles  during  heavy  traffic 
leads  to  a  traffic  standstill.  Information  and 
communications  technologies  models  are 
being  developed  to  explain  the  reasons  for 
such traffic jams so that roads can be designed 
to prevent them.

Bus rapid transit in developing countries

The city of Curitiba, Brazil, pioneered public-transport oriented spatial design based on bus rapid transit, with a system 
that uses dedicated lanes, allowing it to function as a low-cost subway. The system also has a special design for stops that 
facilitates quick payments and easy transfers. Starting at 25,000 daily passengers in 1974, the bus rapid transit system grew 
to serve 2.2 million passengers in 2007. Although the city’s population grew from 400,000 to 2 million in 50 years, it did not 
suﬀer from additional pollution or congestion.

Curitiba’s system was the ﬁrst of its kind in the world and similar systems were later introduced in more than 83 cities glob-
ally. The sharing of knowledge between cities has greatly contributed to the increase in the number of such systems. For 
example, a presentation in 2004 by the mayor of Bogota, Colombia, describing the success of the bus rapid transit system 
in the city motivated the conceptualization of a similar project in Ahmedabad, India.

Since its launch in 2009, the system in Ahmedabad has been expanded to cover a distance of 67 kilometres, with 136 buses 
transporting 130,000 passengers per day. An additional 21 kilometres is expected to be completed by 2015 in phase two of the 
project and a further 27 kilometres is planned for phase three. The system in Ahmedabad is India’s most extensive and success-
ful bus rapid transit system. It gives priority to buses at junctions and uses segregated lanes, level passenger boarding, external 
ticketing and real-time arrivals information to reduce traveling times and ensure better service compared with conventional 
bus services. As a result of factors such as higher eﬃciency and increased ridership, it is estimated to have increased the travel 
speeds of buses by 20 to 60 per cent and achieved carbon dioxide emissions savings of 92,000 tons in 2010.

Information and communications technologies tools for mobility

The city of Dublin, Ireland, is cooperating with International Business Machines to identify and solve the root causes of traf-
ﬁc congestion along its public bus network. Information-sharing between partnering local governments and universities 
is resulting in the use of 3,000 data sets to identify new ways for Dublin’s transport, energy and water systems to work in 
an integrated manner. Such data is also being made available to the local community, which is encouraging the develop-
ment of innovative information and communications technologies tools. Data from a citywide network of sensors is being 
integrated with geospatial data so that city oﬃcials can monitor and manage the bus ﬂeet in real time. 

The same business model is being piloted in Abidjan, Côte d’Ivoire, where the analysis of global positioning system data 
to understand mobility patterns has helped identify four new bus routes and optimize several others. As a result, citywide 
travel time has decreased by 10 per cent and there is less need for informal bus services.

Singapore is using geospatial data and information collected from transport tickets to plan future transport services and rec-
ommend routes and to provide additional services such as the location of taxicabs during rain. Singapore also uses mobile 
telephone data to map current traﬃc situations and propose alternate travel routes to drivers, in order to reduce congestion.

In cooperation with the World Bank, the non-proﬁt organization OpenPlans has developed a real-time traﬃc crowdsourc-
ing application for Cebu City, the Philippines. Once deployed, the application will collect real-time traﬃc data from 500 
telephones deployed in taxicabs. This data will provide citizens with up-to-date information about traﬃc conditions and the 
historical archive will help inform planners and transport engineers.

There are various applications for information 
and  communications  technologies,  such  as 
traffic  management  systems,  open  access 
and  multimodal

Several cities including New York City and San 
Francisco  in  the  United  States  and  London, 
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern 
Ireland,  are  providing  open  access  to  core 
city  data  and  enabling  the  development  of 
applications  that  help  citizens  make  more 
informed  travel  decisions,  such  as  finding 
the closest bicycle-share or car-share station 
(Worldwatch 
Information 
and  communications  technologies  may  also 
be  used  by  citizens  to  plan  a  door-to-door 
journey by integrating walking and different 
modes  of  public  transport  such  as  bicycles, 
buses,  trains  and  automobile-sharing. 
If 
citizens are informed that it is less economical 
for them to drive, for example via applications 
they can access from their mobile telephones, 
they  will  be  more  inclined  to  use  public 
transport.  Online  commercial  tools  that 
provide multimodal routing services, such as 
Open Trip Planner (www.opentripplanner.org) 
and  Moovel  (www.moovel.com),  are  already 
available  in  the  United  States.  Finally,  as 
shown in the examples in box 6, information 
and  communications  technologies-related 
tools that combine geospatial mapping with 
crowdsourced  data  from  mobile  telephones 

or transport tickets can play a role in relieving 
traﬃc and optimizing transport eﬃciency.

Policy considerations

Avoid, shift, improve

Mobility  in  cities  can  be  improved  through 
the  combination  of  three  strategies,  namely 
avoid, shift and improve, which can transform 
behaviour and influence technology choices 
(Asian  Development  Bank  and  German 
Agency  for  International  Cooperation,  2011 
and United Nations Environment Programme, 
2011).  The  avoid  strategy  is  for  reducing 
journeys and avoiding the need to travel. Shift 
represents  a  move  to  more  environmentally 
friendly  modes  of  transport.  Improve  refers 
to  the  improvement  of  energy  efficiency  in 
the transport vehicles used. The avoid–shift–
improve  model  is  based  on  a  combination 
of  incentives  and  disincentives  and  the  use 
of  technology.  For  example,  regulators  can 
aim  to  overcome  automobile  dependence 
through a combination of measures such as 
the following (Wheeler, 2008):

Intermodal transport planning

In developing countries, intermodal transport services are contributing to social inclusion. Several cities in Latin America – 
including La Paz, the Plurinational State of Bolivia; Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; and Medellín, Colombia – are implementing cable 
car and escalator projects to integrate poorer outskirts, located on steep landscapes, with city centres. The cable car, also 
known as a gondola lift, is a transport system that travels up and down a mountainside in which cabins are suspended on 
a continuously moving cable driven by a motor at one end of the route. Cable cars dramatically reduce daily commutes for 
citizens living in areas that are diﬃcult and costly to access with traditional public transport services. 

Free cable cars and escalators were installed in Medellín in order to provide access to the city centre from the most isolated 
neighbourhoods. Before, inhabitants in these neighbourhoods had to commute 2.5 hours to reach the city centre. The 
cable cars now provide access to more than half a million citizens. In addition, a network of escalators has reduced the time 
needed to access one of the poorest sections of the city by half an hour.

Traffic-calming techniques include altering road 
layout and design such as by narrowing entries 
to streets, planting trees and employing variable 
street  surfaces,  speed-restricting  devices  and 
visual signs for cautious driving. On busier roads, 
traffic calming may be achieved by reclaiming 
road  space  for  other  uses  and  reducing  the 
speed  of  traffic.  Traffic-calming  measures  can 
reduce congestion, thereby saving fuel wasted 
in traffic jams and preventing the loss of time. 

Intermodal transport

Traffic  calming  should  be  implemented  in 
coordination  with  schemes  that  make  public 
transport more attractive in the same areas by 
combining  land  use  and  intermodal  transport 
strategies.  Cities  can  reclaim  road  space  in 
parallel to improving intermodal public transport 
networks  such  as  rail  links.  Modern  light-rail 
systems  that  accompany  pedestrian  zones  in 
city  centres  reduce  the  need  for  automobiles. 
Intermodal  transport  networks  include  mass 

rapid-transit  systems  surrounded  by  high-
density 
land-use  developments.  Science, 
technology  and  innovation  can  help  in  the 
process  of  planning  the  integration  of  modes 
of  transport  such  as  walking,  public  transport, 
bicycles, taxicabs and automobiles, for example 
through  park-and-ride  systems.  A 
transit-
oriented  development  approach  concentrates 
residential  and  commercial  developments 
within  walking  distance  of  public  transport 
stations to maximize the number of passengers. 
Intermodal  transport  services  can  contribute 
to social inclusion by combining a wide variety 
of  science,  technology  and  innovation-related 
solutions, as shown by the examples in box 7.

Regulatory mechanisms and incentives

Cities  can  accompany  public 
transport 
investments  with 
infrastructure 
innovative 
regulatory  mechanisms 
and 
incentives. 
Optimizing  urban  mobility  entails  achieving 
the  best  balance  between  different  modes 
of  transportation  (Vuchic,  2008).  Regulations 
such  as  incentives  for  public  transport  use 
and  disincentives  for  automobile  use  can  be 
introduced  in  order  to  reach  a  compromise 
between personal freedom to choose transport 
modes, social optimum modes that minimize 
travel  costs  and  the  time  for  travellers  in  the 
urban area and environmental concerns such 
as the need to reduce air pollution. Measures 
can  include  both  soft  incentives  and  hard 
regulation (Banister, 2008 and Vuchic, 2008).

and  increased  fuel  taxes,  road  pricing  and 
parking-zone  charges.  Road  pricing  may  be 
a  solution  for  traffic  calming  in  larger  cities, 
as shown in box 8, but the investment in the 
technical  infrastructure  necessary  to  operate 
it,  such  as  cameras  that  take  photographs  of 
license plates, road signalling and sensors that 
automatically  deduct  tolls  from  units  inside 
vehicles,  may  not  be  worthwhile  in  smaller 
cities  as  the  scheme  may  not  raise  enough 
funds to cover operational infrastructure costs. 
Political  acceptance  by  the  public  may  be  a 
more  significant  issue  and  road  pricing  also 
requires privacy and data protection measures.

Possible  measures  and  incentives  vary  across 
countries  and 
include  traffic  calming,  the 
promotion of walking, bicycling and automobile-
sharing  programmes  and  the  reallocation  of 
open space to public transport. One important 
element of success for such schemes is to gather 
public  support  by  engaging  stakeholders  and 
communicating  and 
information. 

sharing 

When  launching  bicycling  incentives  such  as 
electric-bicycle promotion campaigns, it is just 
as  important  to  establish  a  legal  framework 
on  the  status  of  such  vehicles  within  city 
traffic  as  it  is  to  make  the  vehicles  available 
and  establish  the  physical  infrastructure.  For 
example,  bicycle-sharing  programmes,  already 
available in around 200 cities worldwide, require 
infrastructure such as parking spaces and tracks 
and a legal framework that protects the rights of 
cyclists. Otherwise, users may not feel safe when 
bicycling in the city.

 Regulatory measures to avoid congestion

Road pricing in Singapore and London

Singapore was one of the ﬁrst cities to apply physical, regulatory and pricing measures to coordinate the use of diﬀerent 
modes in a balanced intermodal transport system. The city pioneered road pricing in the city centre to reduce congestion. In 
parallel, it built a state-of-the art subway system and optimized its bus system with many transfer points and major terminals 
at subway stations. The Land Transport Authority comprehensively plans and coordinates all modes of mobility in Singapore.

London has also implemented congestion pricing in the city centre. While the scheme faced resistance at the beginning, it 
gained more public acceptance after reducing traﬃc levels by 15 to 20 per cent and congestion by over 20 per cent in the 
ﬁrst three years of operation. Milan, Italy and Stockholm, Sweden have also implemented similar measures in their city centres.

Regulation and programmes that encourage walking and bicycling 

London has recently introduced a rewards system through which users can accumulate points as they walk or bicycle and 
redeem them to obtain diﬀerent kinds of services such as haircuts and shopping. A mobile telephone application uses the 
telephone’s global positioning system signal to track movement (see www.recyclebank.com). In Switzerland, a bicycle-to-
work initiative encourages participants to commute up to 50 per cent of the time by bicycling and gain the chance to win 
prizes such as holiday weekends. 

Combination of measures

Cheonggyecheon, a river running through downtown Seoul, was used as a sewer in the 1950s and then covered by an el-
evated motorway in the 1970s. The motorway became very congested in the 1980s and at the same time created an urban 
fault line hampering the livelihood of the middle of the city. In 2003, the metropolitan government removed the motorway, 
restored the river and turned the area into a tourist attraction, creating 300,000 jobs and also providing environmental ben-
eﬁts. The project was accompanied by improvements to the city’s public transportation system, which was made possible 
through a consensus-based decision-making model that promoted intermodal transit, incorporating dedicated bus lanes 
and a uniﬁed fare system. The key to success was the formation of a consultative group, the Citizens Collaborative Council, 
which ensured that no party would be disadvantaged by the proposed transport solutions.

hazards. The  effects  of  climate  change  are 
exacerbating the issue by instigating more 
frequent urban climate-related hazards. On 
the  one  hand,  more  and  more  people  are 
moving  into  vibrant  metropolises  that  are 
situated  on  or  close  to  the  coast.  On  the 
other  hand,  such  cities  are  increasingly  at 
risk due to climate-change induced natural 
disasters,  especially  informal  settlements 
on  city  fringes  and  lower-quality  buildings 
that  are  the  products  of  rapid  unplanned 
urbanization  and  represent  a  resilience 
issue  for  developing  countries,  although 
they  play  an  important  role  in  terms  of 
meeting  the  shelter  needs  of  the  urban 
poor. Low construction standards and poor 
drainage  result  in  serious  vulnerability  to 
natural risks.
Hurricane Sandy, which made landfall in the 
United States in October 2012, only one year 
after Hurricane Irene, served as a reminder 
of the dangers that cities face. New York City 
is one of several global cities at risk due to 
the fact that it is surrounded by water, and 
the precautions such cities can take against 
risks  such  as  rising  sea  levels  are  limited. 
In  developing  countries,  urban  areas  with 
large populations situated along coastlines 
and  exposed  to  climate-related  hazards 
include Guangzhou and Shanghai in China, 
Alexandria in Egypt, Kolkata and Mumbai in 
India and Ho Chi Minh City in Viet Nam.
In the past 20 years, floods have become the 
most frequent natural disaster. The average 
annual  number  of  floods  has  increased  at 
a higher rate than any other natural hazard 
(Green  Media,  2012).  The  most  important 
hazards  that  will  become  more  frequent 
and  affect  urban  zones  due  to  increased 
climate  variability  include  rising  sea  levels, 
storm surges, extreme rain, heat waves and 
the heat-island effect, water scarcity and air 
pollution.

income  countries

settlements.  Disaster  and  climate-change 
risk  is  not  a  priority  due  to  the  lack  of 
financial 
institutional 
capacity.  Finally,  few  have  procedures  to 
mainstream  disaster 
risk  management 
and climate change adaptation into urban 
planning  or  monitoring  of  a  city’s  risk 
reduction  performance  (Thapa  et  al.,  2010 
and Dickson et al., 2012).

Science, technology and innovation 
for monitoring and managing natural 
hazards

A  resilient  city  is  one  that  can  predict  and 
react to natural disasters in order to minimize 
the loss of lives and disruption to city utilities 
and services. The use of technology plays an 
important  role  in  improving  city  resilience 
against  natural  hazards.  Several  cities 
in 
developing  countries  are  already  using 
science,  technology  and  innovation  for  this 
purpose  in  various  forms  and  combinations. 
The  most  common  applications  are  hazard 
monitoring  and  surveillance, 
information 
technology-based 
and 
city  operations  centres,  geospatial  tools  and 
large-scale infrastructure such as storm-water 
tunnels and barriers. 

communications 

Some of the benefits of designing cities that 
are compact and dense were noted in chapter 
III.  a.  Higher  density  also  requires  stronger 
infrastructure  that 
is  resilient  to  natural 
disasters.  Otherwise,  increasing  density  will 
only exacerbate the exposure of cities to such 
risks.  Science,  technology  and  innovation 
play a key role in informing urban planners of 
where to build cities to prevent risks brought 
about  by  climate  change  or  proximity  to  a 
coast.

and 

surveillance 
Hazard  monitoring 
techniques  can  be  beneficial 
for  early 
warning and land-use planning. For example, 
Mumbai  has  35  automatic  weather  stations 
that  measure  real-time  rainfall  intensity  and 
flow  gauges  on  the  Mithi  River  to  monitor 
water flow. Chacao, a subdivision of Caracas, 
has  a  wireless  early-warning  system  that 
connects civil protection and environmental 
institutions  with  cameras  that  monitor  four

river channels crossing the city. The city also 
provides online real-time hazard information 
to citizens (United Nations Office for Disaster 
Risk Reduction, 2012).

Information  and  communications  technolo-
gies that combine data from different depart-
ments can enable cities to monitor risks in an 
integrated manner. Rio de Janeiro established 
an  operations  centre  by  partnering  with  In-
ternational  Business  Machines  that  provides 
real-time integrated data from 30 agencies on 
transport,  energy,  weather  and  emergency 
services.  The  centre  has  improved  reaction 
times  and  coordination  between  agencies. 
For  example,  when  a  20-storey  building  col-
lapsed in January 2012, the centre employees 
alerted the fire and civil defence departments, 
asked the gas and electric companies to shut 
down service in the area, closed the subway 
stop,  blocked  the  street,  dispatched  ambu-
lances,  alerted  hospitals,  sent  equipment  to 
clear the rubble and deployed civil guards to 
secure  the  site. The  centre  also  kept  citizens 
informed over the Internet via Twitter (Singer, 
2012).

Information  and  communications  technolo-
gies  in  the  form  of  geospatial  tools  may  be 
beneficial  for  assessing  disaster  risk  and  di-
saster recovery. For example, such tools were 
used by the International Organization for Mi-
gration in Haiti after the January 2010 earth-
quake  to  identify  appropriate  buildings  and 
sites that could be used as shelters (UNCTAD, 
2012b). 

In  Malaysia,  a  multi-use 
tunnel  was 
constructed  for  storm-water  management 
and road traffic in Kuala Lumpur in response 
to a serious problem of flooding and a need 
to  divert  large  quantities  of  water  from  the 
city.  The  high-technology  tunnel  has  two 
layers  that  can  be  used  in  three  modes 
depending on the intensity of water flow, as 
shown in box 9. In the first mode, the tunnel 
is used for road traffic on an everyday basis. In 
the second mode, when there is a moderate 
storm, one layer is used for road traffic, while 
the  other  layer  diverts  storm-water.  In  the 
third mode, in the event of heavy flooding, 
the tunnel is closed to traffic and both layers 
are used to divert water to holding reservoirs. 
In  some  cities,  lower-technology  solutions 
such  as 
insulating  subway  entrances  to 
prevent  storm-water  from  flowing  in  may 
also be useful in improving resilience.

hazards.  As  oceans  grow  warmer  and  sea 
levels  rise  due  to  the  effects  of  climate 
change,  cities  will  have  to  continuously 
revise  their  risk  assessments  and  adapt  their 
infrastructure. Many of the policies mentioned 
in previous sections can help increase resilience. 
For  example,  improved  buildings  can  reduce 
human  losses  and  spatial  plans  can  take  into 
account the risk of natural disasters. In addition to 
the necessity to save lives when disasters occur,

adaptation has a financial dimension. Investing 
into adaptation earlier can reduce the scale of 
economic losses and the financing required to 
repair damage. Considering that the economic 
damage  that  New  York  City  suffered  due  to 
Hurricane Sandy is estimated at $20 billion, the 
human and economic costs of inaction in less-
prepared cities in developing countries can be 
enormous. The cost of repairing damage from 
climate  change-related  flooding  is  estimated 
at  2  to  6  per  cent  of  regional  gross  domestic 
product  in  Bangkok,  Ho  Chi  Minh  City  and 
Manila, the Philippines (UN-Habitat, 2012c).

Cities  can  mainstream  adaptation  into  urban 
planning.  Possible  measures  include  building 
new  developments  outside  of  risk  areas, 
upgrading informal settlements and addressing 
the lack of infrastructure and the degradation of 
the environment (UN-Habitat, 2012c).

Box 10.  Mainstreaming adaptation into
 
 

urban planning and
urban risk assessments

The  eThekwini  Metropolitan  Municipality,  South  Africa, 
integrated  adaptation  planning  into  its  general  urban 
planning  and  development  framework,  including  ad-
aptation  at  both  municipal  and  community  levels.  In 
2006, a climate change-related impact assessment was 
prepared, following which a climate change adaptation 
strategy was put together to identify key interventions 
for such situations as an urban heat-island eﬀect or a rise 
in sea level. The strategy is constantly being extended, to 
include reforestation projects and water, health and dis-
aster management. An assessment tool was also devel-
oped to evaluate and compare policies and mainstream-
ing initiatives were undertaken, such as the creation of a 
climate protection branch within the municipality.

Sorsogon City, the Philippines, is a city with 152,000 in-
habitants that is open to the Paciﬁc Ocean to both the 
east and west. The city faces an average of ﬁve tropical 
storms  each  year.  In  cooperation  with  UN-Habitat,  the 
city  conducted  a  vulnerability  and  adaptation  assess-
ment,  as  a  result  of  which  it  directed  urban  develop-
ment plans to safer inland areas. Settlements in high-risk 
coastal zones will be incrementally relocated through lo-
cal shelter relocation projects or voluntary resettlement. 
Inland  areas  will  be  incentivized  through  infrastructure 
investments  and  the  construction  of  new  residential 
units and new industrial sites for employment.

Integrating spatial planning with infrastruc-
ture  can  also  improve  resilience.  Risk  as-
sessments  are  tools  that  can  mainstream 
resilience  and  preparedness  into  spatial 
planning. The tools map the areas that are 
most vulnerable to hazards and help adjust 
land use and development strategies. Some 
cities or city areas are more vulnerable than 
others  and  risk  assessments  make  it  pos-
sible to demarcate and provide extra safety 
for these areas. Regulatory measures based 
on  risk  assessments  can  help  city  planners 
forecast and guard against future develop-
ments to avoid the risk of disaster. 

For  example,  Dhaka,  Bangladesh,  accom-
panied 
infrastructure  measures  such  as 
reinforcing  river  and  canal  embankments 
with  efforts  to  prevent  the  encroachment 
of  buildings  on  the  vicinity  of  canals  for 
improved  protection  against  major  floods. 
Similarly,  regulatory  measures  based  on 
risk assessments can guide future develop-
ments  to  avoid  disaster  risk.  For  example, 
Singapore  requires  new  land  reclamations 
to be at least 2.25 metres above the highest 
level of recorded tides (UN-Habitat, 2012c).

The  United  Nations  Environment  Pro-
gramme,  UN-Habitat  and  the  World  Bank, 
with the support of Cities Alliance, a global 
partnership  for  urban  poverty  reduction 
and  the  promotion  of  the  role  of  cities  in 
sustainable  development,  have  developed 
a  standardized  risk  assessment  tool  to  as-
sess urban risk and identify areas and popu-
lations  that  are  most  vulnerable,  typically 
those  living  in  informal  settlements.  The 
tool  provides  a  framework  for  both  quali-
tative  and  quantitative  assessments  that 
enhance  a  local  government’s  capacity  to 
identify  hazards  that  may  arise  from  disas-
ter  and  climate  change-related  risks.  The 
tool assesses the exposure and vulnerability 
of specific assets and populations, analyses 
institutional capacities and data availability 
and  quantifies  city  vulnerabilities  through 
the application of a baseline-benchmarking 
approach to assess progress over time and 
space (UN-Habitat, 2012c). box 10 provides 
examples  of  the  use  of  urban  risk  assess-
ments to improve disaster resilience.

IV. Sustainable urban resource management

Energy,  water  and  food  consumption  in 
urban areas in developing countries is rapidly 
rising  in  parallel  with  growing  incomes, 
putting  pressure  on  limited  resources.  At 
the same time, higher consumption leads to 
higher  amounts  of  waste.  Long-term  urban 
sustainability  depends  on 
technologies 
that  conserve 
resources  and  minimize 
waste. Fortunately, science, technology and 
innovation options are abundant to respond 
to the needs of cities, and this chapter looks 
at  ways  in  which  they  can  help  improve 
resource  management  in  an  urban  setting.

IV. a. Energy for cities

Heavy energy consumption in cities

Cities  are  major  consumers  of  energy  and 
therefore  vulnerable  to  energy  scarcity  and 
energy  price 
increases.  Adequate  energy 
supply to growing urban zones is increasingly 
becoming a challenge. It is largely expected 
that in cities of emerging countries, demand 
will continue to exceed capacity in the coming 
years. This raises questions on how to improve 
energy  efficiency,  regulate  the  electricity 
market, involve the private sector and revise 
the mechanism of subsidized energy pricing, 
among  others  (GlobeScan  and  McCormick 
Rankin Corporation McLean Hazel, 2007). 

Large centralized energy production facilities 
require  costly  distribution  systems  that  are 
vulnerable  to  misuse  and  natural  disasters. 
In  rapid-growth  urban  environments,  low-
density  sprawl  leads  to  a  rapid  increase  in 
per capita distribution and line-maintenance 
costs.  In  many  countries,  distribution  lines 
are  also  subject  to  siphoning.  Moreover, 
centralized  energy  production 
follows  a 
supply-driven  approach,  prioritizing  selling 
energy  over  saving  energy,  creating  no 
incentives 
for  energy-efficiency  practices 
that  can  reduce  consumption.  With  rapid 
urbanization,  providing  access  to  electricity 
in a centralized manner for growing cities will 
grow more challenging.

Science, technology and innovation for 
urban energy conservation

Various clean low-carbon energy technologies 
compatible with use in cities are available to 
improve  energy  efficiency  and  enable  the 
transition  to  renewable  energy  sources  in 
cities.  Table  3  gives  examples  of  innovative 
energy technologies that may be considered 
for  densely  populated  urban  areas  (UN-
Habitat, 2012b). Each technology has market-
related, technical, institutional, political, social 
and environmental challenges on the way to 
mainstream  use.  Cost  competitiveness  with 
fossil-fuel  energy  sources  is  a  major  issue. 
The  technical  limitations  of  clean  energy 
technologies such as the battery efficiency of 
solar photovoltaic technology and issues such 
as the lack of infrastructure or trained workers 
and the lack of public acceptance also need 
to  be  overcome  (Organization  for  Economic 
Cooperation and Development, 2012).

Solar thermal 
storage

Solar thermal power plants gather heat from the sun and boil water into 
steam  to  generate  electricity  by  running  a  turbine. The  energy  can  be 
temporarily stored and used when needed during peak hours.

Micro 
hydropower 
systems

Micro  hydropower  systems  can  complement  intermittent  wind  or  solar 
energy by pumping water to an upper reservoir when excess energy is 
produced and letting it down when more energy is needed.

Converting 
kinetic energy 
from walking

Purpose-made  slabs  installed  on  pavements  can  harvest  renewable 
energy from footsteps. The technology, developed by Pavegen, converts 
kinetic energy to electricity that can be stored and used for powering off-
grid  applications  such  as  pedestrian  lighting,  wayfinding  solutions  and 
advertising signage (see www.pavegen.com).

Heating

District 
heating

District heating systems can distribute heat and power from a centralized 
location. The  heat  often  comes  from  combined  heat  and  power  plants 
and can therefore achieve higher efficiencies and lower emissions than 
separated heat and power production.

Electric grids

Smart grids

Smart  grids  are  intelligent  electric  systems  that  have  the  following 
three  major  components:  demand  management;  distributed  energy 
generation; and transmission and distribution grid management. 

Lighting

Vehicle-to-
grid

Light-
emitting 
diodes

Once the number of electric vehicles in urban traffic reaches a critical mass, 
it will be possible to benefit from bidirectional connections between the 
batteries of such vehicles and smart electricity grids. At peak times for the 
grid, if a vehicle is not in use, it can feed energy from its battery back into 
the grid.

Partnerships  between  information  and  communications  technologies 
networking  and  lighting  companies  are  making  smart,  networked 
information  and  communications  technologies-based  lighting  with 
light-emitting  diodes  possible.  Light-emitting  diode  technologies  can 
generate relatively effortless and immediate savings in electricity.

Information and 
communications 
technologies

Carbon-
footprint 
applications

Information  and  communications  technologies-related  applications 
can  help  encourage  more  sustainable  energy  consumption  patterns 
by  individuals,  for  example  by  proactively  tracking  and  distributing 
information on personal carbon footprints and consumption patterns.

UN-Habitat, 2012b; and Villa and Mitchell, 2010.

Information  and  communications  technolo-
gies play a critical role in many of the options 
listed in table 3. They enable the automated, 
or smart, management of electricity genera-
tion  and  distribution,  leading  to  lower  con-
sumption and reductions in carbon emissions 
(Souter  and  MacLean,  2012). The  large-scale 
use of information and communications tech-
nologies for energy management in urban ar-
eas  in  the  medium  to  long  term  will  have  a 
profound  impact  on  consumption  patterns. 

The possibility for households to be informed 
of patterns of consumption and to compare 
them  is  likely  to  induce  behaviour  that  con-
serves energy.

Policy considerations

Although  energy  policy  is  a  national  issue, 
cities in developing countries can lead the 
way in leapfrogging to advanced renewable 
energy  sources  and  efficient  transmission

Box 11.  Regulatory support for renewable energy

The Government of India formulated a solar cities programme in order to reduce demand for fossil-fuel energy sources 
by  at  least  10  per  cent  in  sixty  cities  between  2007  and  2012. The  programme  allocates  ﬁnancial  assistance  to  local 
governments that show commitment to implementing renewable energy projects through master plans, governance 
structures and project proposals. 

The authorities of the city of Rizhao, China, provided strong political and ﬁnancial support for the development of a local 
solar panel industry. As a result, solar technology became widespread, with 99 per cent of Rizhao’s households in the 
central districts using solar water heaters and almost all traﬃc signals, street lights and park illuminations powered by so-
lar energy. In addition, solar cooking facilities are common in households and solar panels are used to heat greenhouses, 
reducing overhead costs for farmers.

Shanghai envisages a total of 13 wind farms with an installed capacity of 2.1 gigawatts by 2020, which will provide elec-
tricity to more than 4 million households. The plan includes China’s ﬁrst oﬀshore wind farm, which is also the world’s ﬁrst 
major wind farm outside of Europe. It will provide around 1 per cent of the city’s total power production.

In several cities across Eastern Europe that had older district heating infrastructure, modernization eﬀorts driven by Eu-
ropean Union directives as well as national energy programmes are taking place that could generate 15 to 30 per cent 
savings in heating energy. Since district heating can use renewable energy sources such as biomass, geothermal and 
solar energy with biomass, it harbours great potential for countries that already have infrastructure for this technology 
in place.

regulations, 
incentives  or  subsidies,  as  shown  in  the 
examples in box 11. Cities can pioneer the 
transition  to  renewable  energy  by  making 
use of national incentives as well.

for  decentralized 

The  use  of  new  technologies  in  cities  can 
reduce  the  burden  of  rapidly  increasing 
energy demand, as shown in the examples 
in box 12. For instance, implementing smart 
grids 
increases  the  flexibility  of  energy 
production  and  distribution  by  making 
it  possible 
individual 
energy producers, for example households 
with  solar  panels  on  their  roofs,  to  feed 
surplus  energy  back  into  the  electricity 
grid  (Cosgrave,  2012).  Smart  grids  provide 
real-time  information  to  utility  companies 
with  the  help  of  sensors,  enabling  them 
to  respond  to  changes  in  power  supply, 
demand,  costs  and  emissions  and  to 
prevent  major  power  outages.  Smart 
grids  can  drive  cross-sectoral  cooperation, 
enable  decentralized  energy  generation 
and  encourage  more  efficient  energy 
consumption patterns.

Smart grid investment should be prioritized 
in  large  cities  that  face  frequent  peaks  in 
electricity  demand  and  also  have  a  high

excess  power  generated  by  their  private 
facilities,  such  as  micro  wind  turbines 
or  solar  energy  panels  located  in  homes 
(Robinson,  2012).  The  deployment  of 
smart grids could generate up to $4 trillion 
worth  of  savings  until  2050  in  Europe, 
mainly due to the reduced need to invest 
in  new  electricity  generation  capacity

and Development, 2012).

The following cities are partnering with Cisco to provide integrated city data for use in improving traﬃc, public transporta-
tion, energy eﬃciency and the self-management of carbon footprints by residents: Hamburg, Germany; Amsterdam, the 
Netherlands; Lisbon, Portugal; Seoul; Madrid, Spain; Birmingham, United Kingdom; and San Francisco.

Kinetic energy

Purpose-made  slabs  installed  on  pavements  can  convert  kinetic  energy  from  footsteps  to  electricity.  The  technology, 
developed  by  Pavegen,  is  best  suited  to  high-footfall  urban  environments  and  represents  a  good  example  of  how 
clean  technologies  can  also  be  enjoyable,  which  is  an  important  aspect  for  general  public  awareness  and  adoption. 
The technology was installed in 2012 at a subway station in London near the Olympics facilities.

Oﬀ-grid energy generation

Sunlabob,  a  company  in  the  Lao  People’s  Democratic  Republic,  started  operations  by  providing  solar  electriﬁcation  to 
homes  on  a  rental  basis.  It  established  an  innovative  public–private  partnership  business  model  whereby  local  public 
authorities covered part of the investment cost through ownership of solar lamps that were rented out to households, 
while Sunlabob owned the charging stations. The company created a national network of franchises and provided training 
on marketing, installation and maintenance. Following its initial success, Sunlabob diversiﬁed to oﬀer a full range of renew-
able energy solutions, such as solar water pumps and heaters, water puriﬁcation systems, street lighting solutions, cooling 
units for health posts and solar lanterns.

Another oﬀ-grid solution provider is M-Kopa, a start-up in Kenya that has designed a solar lamp consisting of a base station 
with a solar panel, three lamps and a charging kit for use with telephones. Users can pay for part of the system upfront and 
the rest via minimal instalments that they transfer by using mobile telephones. The lamps can replace kerosene lamps that 
are not only expensive but also dangerous to health.

Integrated energy and waste management

The  Hammarby  Sjöstad  district  of  Stockholm  is  an  ecological  district  that  has  used  brownfield  industry  space  for 
development, referred to as the Hammarby Model in urban planning. The district minimizes energy use while opti-
mizing water use and waste management with the help of recycling, energy and waste treatment plants. Buildings 
send waste and wastewater to combined heat and power plants and wastewater treatment plants that then produce 
heating, biogas and electricity for the buildings. The district plans to produce 50 per cent of its energy requirements 
locally.

IV. b. Solid waste management

Exponential growth in urban waste

Uncontrolled  solid  waste  is  growing  faster 
than  urbanization  and  represents  a  serious 
issue  for  the  sustainability  of  cities.  Growing 
cities generate higher amounts of waste per 
inhabitant.  Rates  of  solid  waste  growth  are 
fastest in China, other countries in East Asia, 
parts of Eastern Europe and the Middle East 
(Hoornweg and Perinaz, 2012). The amount of 
solid waste generated in rapidly growing cities 
in developing countries is a serious health risk 
for  their  populations.  Using  landfills  reduces 

the  attractiveness  of  cities.  Landfills  do  not 
decompose  easily,  and  produce  methane, 
which  heavily  contributes  to  greenhouse 
gas  emissions.  The 
incineration  of  solid 
waste is also not preferable as it can cause air 
pollution. Although waste is an energy source 
that could be reused, it is not seen as such in 
many countries.

The  cost  of  solid  waste  management  can 
be very high, reaching up to half of the total 
municipal  budget  of  medium-sized  cities  in 
lower-income  countries.  Global  solid  waste 
generation is due to increase from 1.3 billion 
tons per year to 2.2 billion tons by 2025. It is 
an urgent priority, especially in lower-income

Integrated solid waste management in practice

In Kalundborg, Denmark, companies located in an industrial zone started selling waste products as raw materials to each 
other in 1961. The network later grew to include more than 30 exchange pipes. Surplus heat, steam and other residue 
generated from a 1,500 megawatt coal-ﬁred power plant are all reutilized by nearby businesses, reducing the ecological 
footprint of the plant and involved companies.

São Paulo implemented a landﬁll emissions control programme that renovated two solid waste landﬁlls. Methane-rich 
biogas from decaying waste was used to generate electric power on site. The programme both reduced the amount of 
methane released into the atmosphere and supplied energy to 7 per cent of households in São Paulo. The programme 
was approved as a Clean Development Mechanism project of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
Change. In 2008, the programme was generating a number of carbon credits that was close to the sum of all other 
certiﬁed projects in Brazil. The city used the proceeds of these credits to fund urban and environmental improvement 
projects in surrounding areas.

countries,  where  serious  increases  in  solid 
waste  management  costs  are  expected 
(Hoornweg and Perinaz, 2012).

Science, technology and innovation for 
waste management

Integrated  solid  waste  management  is  a 
waste  management  approach  that  refers  to 
a  shift  from  less-preferred  waste  treatment 
and  disposal  methods  such  as  incineration 
and different forms of landfilling towards the 
reduce, reuse and recycle, or three Rs, model, 
as shown in the examples in box 13.

Activities  under 
management can include the following:

integrated  solid  waste 

•  Resource  conservation,  which  avoids 

excessive resource consumption.

•  Waste  reduction  through  resource-use 

optimization.

•  Waste collection and segregation, ensuring 

appropriate waste treatment.

•  Waste  reuse,  which  circulates  waste  and 

avoids the use of new resources.

•  Waste recycling, which converts waste into 

useful products.

•  Energy recovery, which harnesses residual 
energy  from  waste.  For  example,  waste 
and wastewater can be used for producing 
biogas, 
synthetic 
construction materials.

synthetic  gas  and 

•  Landfill  avoidance,  which  conserves  land 

and avoids the risks of contamination.

•  Construction 

and  maintenance 

of 
infrastructure for waste collection, recovery 
of  materials  from  waste  streams  through 
collection, segregation and the application 
of technologies related to the three Rs and 
associated activities.

The  long-term  vision  under  integrated  solid 
waste  management  is  to  establish  a  circular 
economy  in  which  the  use  of  materials  and 
the  generation  of  waste  are  minimized, 
any  unavoidable  waste 
recycled  or 
remanufactured  and  any  remaining  waste  is 
treated in a way that causes the least damage 
to health and the environment or even creates 
value  by  recovering  energy  (Totty,  2011  and 
United  Nations  Environment  Programme, 
2011).

Policy considerations

Following  the  Hammarby  Sjöstad  and 
Kalundborg examples, cities can make use 
of technologies to convert certain types of 
waste  into  energy.  Many  Governments  in 
Europe are promoting ecological industrial 
parks, also referred to as industrial symbiosis 
systems.  Emerging  economy  cities  are 
also 
implementing  projects  based  on 
integrated  solid  waste  management  and 
the three Rs. 

26

Science, Technology and Innovation for Sustainable Urbanization

Public–private  partnerships,  as  well  as 
joint  initiatives  of  local  communities  and 
non-governmental  organizations,  can  be 
effective  in  launching  waste  management 
initiatives. 
In  several  countries,  public–
private partnerships between municipalities 
and the private sector, as well as organized 
initiatives  by  citizens,  are  already  actively 
participating  in  solid  waste  management, 
as shown by the examples in box 14. 

Managing  solid  waste  in  combination  with 
spatial  planning  can  help  optimize  energy 
consumption and reduce waste in cities (UN-
Habitat, 2012c). For example, the location of 
landfills  can  minimize  negative  effects  and 
providing sorting and recycling space close to 
locations where waste is generated can help 
reduce the size of disposal sites.

IV. c. Resource-efficient  

  buildings

 

 

High energy consumption in buildings

The  built  environment  poses  a  challenge 
for  resource  efficiency.  Buildings  account  for 
40 per cent of global energy use, 38 per cent 
of  global  greenhouse  gas  emissions,  12  per 
cent of global potable water use and 40 per 

cent  of  solid  waste  streams  in  developed 
countries 
(United  Nations  Environment 
Programme,  2012a).  The  lack  of  resource 
efficiency  measures 
for  existing  or  new 
buildings results in a missed opportunity and 
carries  the  resource  burden,  environmental 
damage  and  social 
into  the 
future.  Since  new  buildings  are  long-term 
investments and the housing stock of cities is 
gradually replaced, policies requiring resource 
efficiency standards can combine affordability 
with sustainability in the long term.

inequality 

terms  of  current  and 

Especially  in  cities  in  developing  countries, 
the  built  environment  is  a  cause  of  concern 
in 
forthcoming 
housing  shortages.  There  is  high  demand 
for affordable housing in the cities of rapidly 
urbanizing countries in Asia, Africa and Latin 
America and a lack of space for newcomers. 
In  China,  it  is  estimated  that  as  much  new 
building  floor  space  will  be  built  until  2030 
as  the  entire  existing  building  stock  of  the 
United States (UN-Habitat, 2012a). Due to the 
fact  that  the  supply  of  affordable  housing, 
infrastructure  and  services  is  not  able  to 
catch  up  with  the  rate  of  urbanization  in 
developing  countries,  informal  shelters  are 
built  with  no  infrastructure,  little  sanitation 
and no compliance with planning or building 
regulations.

Box 14.  Public–private partnerships and community initiatives for solid waste management

In developing countries, public–private partnerships and innovative community initiatives are contributing to the manage-
ment of urban waste.

For example, in 1998 in Dhaka, a city of 12 million inhabitants where the municipality cannot process more than 30 to 40 per 
cent of generated solid waste, Waste Concern, a local non-governmental organization, launched a public–private partner-
ship for waste collection with logistical support and programme coordination by public authorities. Local communities col-
lected waste that complied with the minimum quality benchmarks of Waste Concern and sold it to private fertilizer compa-
nies. The initiative reduced greenhouse gas emissions, saved landﬁll area in the city and provided employment for women.

The public–private partnership model of Waste Concern was replicated in several other cities and towns in Bangladesh, ser-
vicing a total population of 130,000 in 15 cities. The collection of waste helped avoid the production of methane gas that is 
released when organic waste is deposited at a landﬁll. The project was registered with the Clean Development Mechanism.

The Waste Concern model was extended to three composting models and four ﬁnancial models, following which it was ap-
plied in other countries. The city of Matale in Sri Lanka established an integrated centre to treat organic waste and produce 
high-quality compost with assistance from Waste Concern and the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for 
Asia and the Paciﬁc. The project is now being replicated by the Commission in 10 cities in Asia.

resource-efficient buildings

indoor 

Resource-consuming  buildings  harbour  the 
greatest potential for resource and emissions 
reductions. Sustainable houses can be built by 
using a range of techniques and practices that 
improve  resource  efficiency  and  contribute 
to  healthy 
living  conditions  at  a 
reasonable cost. Solutions differ according to 
the type of house, the climate zone and the 
available  infrastructure  around  the  building, 
such  as  whether  there  is  access  to  district 
heating.  Using  sustainable  technologies  in 
new  buildings  could  achieve  a  30  to  50  per 
cent  reduction  in  energy  use,  a  35  per  cent 
reduction 
in  greenhouse  gas  emissions, 
a  40  per  cent  reduction  in  water  use  and 
a  70  per  cent  reduction  in  waste  outputs 
(United  Nations  Environment  Programme, 
2012a). 

The  vast  majority  of  cities  evolve  gradually 
and  retrofitting  is  therefore  a  key  science, 
technology  and  innovation-related  approach 
on  which  they  need  to  rely.  Retrofitting 
existing  buildings  can  bring  about  significant 
efficiencies,  both  in  terms  of  the  building 
itself  and  the  city  in  general.  It  is  cheaper 
to  build  and  retrofit  in  an  urban  zone  that 
already  benefits  from  connections  to  utilities 
and  transport  networks.  Many  cities  are 
implementing  retrofitting  programmes  such 
as  the  transformation  of  industrial  riverfronts 
or the replacement of obsolete structures, for 
example  in  the  Cheonggyecheon  project  in 
Seoul, as noted in box 8. Table 4 lists examples 
of technology options for sustainable buildings.

Buildings  can  employ  either  passive  or 
active  environmental  design  strategies. 
Passive design techniques such as improved 

is  greater 

insulation, natural ventilation and daylighting 
take  advantage  of  the  building’s  site  or 
climatic  characteristics  to  improve  resource 
efficiency. According to energy consumption 
guidelines 
in  the  United  Kingdom,  the 
introduction  of  natural  ventilation  can 
save  55  to  60  per  cent  of  the  energy  used 
in  fully  air-conditioned  and  glazed  office 
buildings 
(United  Nations  Environment 
Programme,  2011).  The  potential  use  of 
passive  strategies 
in  tropical 
regions  due  to  the  priority  of  blocking 
heat  rather  than  generating  it  efficiently 
(Municipal  Government  of  Shanghai  et  al., 
2011).  However,  active  systems  employ 
technologies such as solar panels or energy-
efficient  appliances  to  improve  efficiency 
(United  Nations  Environment  Programme, 
2012a). A study in the United States of more 
than  5,000  commercial  buildings  showed 
that  in  new  buildings,  employing  energy-
efficient  lighting,  heating,  ventilation,  air 
conditioning  and  shading  can  achieve  a 
64 per cent reduction in energy use (United 
Nations Environment Programme, 2012a).

While  the  operational  phase  of  a  building 
represents the most significant opportunity 
for  resource  efficiency,  using  innovative 
construction  technology  can  also  save 
costs and resources, as demonstrated in the 
examples in box 15. New prefabricated and 
modular  building  techniques,  making  use 
of local building materials and local know-
how,  can  optimize  the  resource  efficiency 
of construction (Kaye, 2012). Using building 
materials  without  harmful  chemicals  has  a 
highly positive impact on the health of users. 
In  addition,  recycling  building  materials 
can dramatically reduce the environmental 
impact of the building process.

Windows provide views and daylight, passive solar energy and natural 
ventilation to buildings. Through their optimal orientation and use, windows 
can provide net energy to buildings. Automated shading is essential in warmer 
climates to limit heat from the sun. Natural light is beneﬁcial to productivity, 
well-being and health.
Homes may be placed with large facades facing east and west, letting in 
morning and evening sunlight. Offices may have large facades facing north and 
south, letting in high quality daylight, with shielding from direct sunlight to 
avoid overheating.
Adding plants to rooftops, walls and balconies offers many beneﬁts, as follows: 
added insulation; reduced runoff of water during heavy rain; aesthetic qualities; 
noise reduction; and a reduced heat-island effect.
Photovoltaic cells can deliver clean energy to a building on site, eliminating 
transmission losses. Combined with a heat pump, solar power can also generate 
heating. The falling prices of photovoltaic cells have rendered their use more 
feasible in many parts of the world.
Solar window blinds keep buildings cool by blocking sunlight and at the same 
time produce electricity via photovoltaic technology.
Similar to solar panels, solar shingles are based on photovoltaic technology. 
However, shingles can absorb more light and their durability makes it possible to 
use them as roofing material.
Generating energy from wind by placing turbines on top of commercial or 
residential buildings can cover a large percentage of the structure’s energy 
needs.
Solar heating systems can provide heat and hot water and can be combined 
with heat pumps to create heat depots in hot periods for use in cooler weather.
Insulation materials, from mineral wool to aerogel, are essential in every climate 
for keeping heat either in or out of a building.
Techniques which use natural convection currents within air flow to direct air 
into and out of buildings in order to replace rising warm air with cooler air can 
function with minimal or no mechanical parts or energy consumption. For 
example, air ducts can be designed to allow air to enter low in the building via 
underground ducts, while simultaneously allowing air to escape from higher up 
the building, and provide for natural ventilation.
Earth-to-water or air-to-water heat pumps can draw thermal energy from the 
surroundings into buildings, multiplying the energy used, whereby 1 kilowatt-
hour of electricity can deliver 2 to 4 kilowatt-hours of heat.
Ambiators can cool interiors by using thermodynamic technology based 
on evaporation at a fraction of the energy consumption of conventional air 
conditioning. Ambiators process air through a pump that recuperates heat and 
reduces temperature. The pre-cooled air then passes through an evaporative 
cooling module that uses limited amounts of water to cool the air further 
(see www.hmx.co.in). Ambiators are more suitable for low-humidity locations.

consumption.
Rainwater can be held in fascines or tanks, reducing runoff during heavy rain. 
The water can then be reused in water closets.

Reducing the amount of ground covered by buildings, pavements, roads, 
parking lots, etc. reduces both the local heat-island effect and pressure on 
sewage and drainage, as the earth can absorb more water during heavy rain.
Monitoring and controlling energy demand in buildings can reduce energy 
consumption by 5 to 10 per cent.

Innovative construction technologies in practice

In Harare, Zimbabwe, the Eastgate shopping centre and oﬃce block was designed and built with an innovative passive 
cooling system that stores heat in daytime. The warm air rises in the evening, replaced by denser cool air low in the building. 
The shopping centre has avoided the need for artiﬁcial air conditioning and saved $3.5 million.

Broad Sustainable Building, a company in China, uses pre-manufactured structures for more sustainable building construc-
tion. This technique was implemented in the construction of the Tower Hotel in Yueyang. The building has several features, 
such as resilience to earthquakes of up to 9.0 on the Richter scale, thermal insulation and the ability to produce biogas from 
sewage and use hot wastewater for heating purposes. Broad Sustainable Building produced 93 per cent of the building 
parts in its factory and then shipped them to the construction site, where the building was assembled in only 15 days by 
bolting the pre-constructed modules together. The construction process required no water, welding or scaﬀolding, caused 
minimal dust and created only 1 per cent of the waste that is common in similar construction sites.

In Cuba, which has a programme for low energy and material consumption for housing, more than ﬁfty thousand homes 
have been built in the last 20 years by using alternative building techniques with ecological materials that use recycled 
waste products and special types of tile, cement and concrete blocks. The materials require less energy and fewer resources. 
Biological wastes are used as fuel and bamboo is used in the construction process.

Policy considerations

Public support and regulation can speed up 
the  adoption  of  green  building  practices  in 
the  construction  sector.  Innovative  building 
regulation  can  also  help  improve  resilience 
and environmental quality in cities, as shown 
in the examples in box 16.

Standard  measurement  and  reporting  re-
quirements  for  building  performance 
in 
terms  of  energy  efficiency  and  greenhouse 
gas  emissions  can  increase  the  use  of  sus-
tainable construction in the real estate sec-
tor. They  can  also  make  it  easier  to  embed 
the environmental performance of buildings 
into calculations of their financial value. To-
wards this end, the United Nations Environ-
ment Programme is piloting a common car-
bon metric that will measure emissions from 
buildings  based  on  energy  use,  such  as  in 
heating,  cooling,  ventilation,  lighting  and 
appliances  (see  www.unep.org/sbci/Activi-
ties/CCM_Pilot.asp).  This  metric  will  allow 
data-driven  comparisons  between  build-
ings.  In  addition,  the  Bonn  Centre  for  Local 
Climate  Action  and  Reporting,  which  was 
established  in  December  2009  as  an  initia-
tive of the United Nations Environment Pro-
gramme  and  the  International  Council  for 
Local  Environmental  Initiatives–Local  Gov-
ernments  for  Sustainability,  facilitates  the 
voluntary  publication  of  city  commitments, 

actions  and  performance  in  terms  of  emis-
sion reductions (see www.carbonn.org). The 
centre also provides guidance for emissions 
reporting.  A  notable  example  of  voluntary 
reporting initiatives is the Greenprint Perfor-
mance  Report,  which  measures  the  energy 
consumption and greenhouse gas emissions 
of assets owned by members of the Green-
print  Foundation,  a  worldwide  alliance  of 
real-estate investors.

Establishing multi-tier building rating systems 
can guide the real estate sector in adopting 
comprehensive  green  building  standards. 
Green  building  rating  systems  that  certify 
environmental building design strategies are 
starting to be implemented globally. Notable 
examples are the Green Rating for Integrated 
Habitat Assessment in India, the Green Mark 
initiative  in  Singapore,  which  aims  to  shift 
industry  towards 
Singapore’s  construction 
friendly  buildings, 
more  environmentally 
the 
Establishment 
Environmental  Assessment  Methodology  in 
the  United  Kingdom  and  the  Leadership  in 
Energy and Environmental Design certification 
in  the  United  States.  The  latter  is  provided 
to  buildings  that  are  generally  designed  to 
be  healthier  and  safer  for  residents  and  to 
operate at a lower cost and higher asset value, 
reduce  waste,  conserve  energy  and  water 
and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Green 
building rating systems should be promoted

Innovative building regulations in practice

Local governments may lead by example and implement energy-eﬃciency measures in new public buildings. For example, 
the new city hall of Seoul uses a combination of photovoltaic, solar and geothermal energy for power generation.

Vienna, Austria has an energy-eﬃciency policy that subsidizes new housing projects based on a competitive selection process 
that includes energy eﬃciency among its criteria. The city also partially subsidizes the refurbishment of existing buildings.

Stuttgart, Germany has analysed weather patterns to develop an urban climatic map and identify wind paths that transport 
clean air into the city and improve air quality by reducing the heat-island eﬀect. As a result, constructing new buildings that 
would prevent air ﬂow through these wind paths is prohibited.

As of 2016, new residences in England will be required comply with higher energy-eﬃciency standards, with heating en-
ergy demand levels corresponding to one-ﬁfth of current buildings and on-or-oﬀ-site renewable energy generation for all 
building-related energy demands such as lighting and ventilation. By 2030, 2 to 3 million new homes will be built according 
to these zero carbon standards.

Rooftops  cover  one-ﬁfth  of  urban  surface  areas.  Green  roofs  can  be  used  to  provide  insulation  and  thereby  reduce 
heating and cooling costs for buildings, while at the same time absorbing rainwater and ﬁltering pollutants so that the 
cleaned water may be reused. Some countries such as Austria, Canada, Germany, Switzerland and the United States are 
introducing regulation that makes it compulsory to construct green roofs on all new buildings or allocating subsidies 
for converting existing roofs. Toronto, Canada, is the ﬁrst city in North America to require green roofs on new buildings. 
Several cities are also investing in rooftop gardens and trees that are designed to hold water. In Seattle, United States, 
households are reimbursed for putting in place such rain gardens. Rainwater harvesting from roofs was made manda-
tory in Bangalore, India, through a water supply and sewerage bill in 2009. Existing buildings that do not install rainwater 
harvesting structures are penalized.

first and foremost at the level of municipalities 
and other local governance structures. Local 
authorities  should  also  provide  transparent 
information  to  the  real  estate  sector  on 
green building construction costs, which are 
normally lower than perceived by the public 
and  can  easily  be  recuperated  in  the  long 
term owing to lower operating costs.

However,  green  buildings  require  higher 
start-up  costs.  Local  authorities  can  provide 
construction companies with incentives such 
as  cash  payments,  loans  or  lower  taxes,  in 
order that they may benefit from some of the 
long-term  savings  resulting  from  the  lower 
resource use of ecological construction. If the 
business  model  of  green  regulation  passes 
resource  efficiency  savings  only  to  building 
owners, construction companies may not be 
willing  to  invest. Therefore,  the  introduction 
of  green  building  regulation  should  be 
accompanied by information campaigns that 
educate  builders  on  the  technical  aspects 
of  new  standards  and  by  potential  financial 
incentives  such  as  favourable  tax  policies  or 
interest  rates  that  may  compensate  for  the 
extra  start-up  costs  of  green  construction 

(Municipal  Government  of  Shanghai  et  al., 
2011).

Green buildings need not be confined to cities 
in high-income countries. Local governments 
in developing countries can address housing 
shortages  through  construction 
initiatives 
for  affordable,  sustainable  housing  and  the 
upgrading  of  informal  settlements.  box  17 
provides  examples  of  such  programmes  in 
developing countries.

The damage of urban sprawl on 
peri-urban areas

Peri-urbanization,  sometimes  referred  to  as 
spillover growth, refers to urban growth into 
zones that lie between a city and rural zones, 
usually  without  spatial  planning  and  the 
provision of basic services. Development of 
city fringes that undergo peri-urbanization is 
most often triggered by a real-estate boom 
that  accompanies 
rapid  urban  growth.

benefit  from  new  economic  dynamism  in 
manufacturing  and  services  brought  by 
urbanization,  yet  they  do  not  always  enjoy 
improvements in quality of life.

People  living  in  peri-urban  areas  suffer  the 
consequences  of  unplanned  urban  growth 
most  intensely,  as  they  face  environmental 
pollution,  rapid  social  transformation  and 
poverty.  Peri-urbanization  also  results 
in 
conflicts  in  basic  needs  and  resources  such 
as  water.  Although  peri-urban  zones 
in 
developing countries are often neglected in 
the process of urban growth and lack basic 
services  such  as  water  and  sanitation,  they 
have  a  key  role  to  play  in  supplying  cities 
with  food,  energy,  water,  building  materials 
and  critical  ecosystem 
services.  Their 
success  or  failure  has  implications  beyond 
their  vicinity.  Since  there  is  no  return  from 
urbanization and no future in rural poverty, 
the key question is in how to undertake the 
right urbanization for peri-urban zones.

The  rules  for  the  administrative  governance 
of  peri-urban  areas  are  often  unclear.  Rapid 
urbanization  causes  peri-urban  zones  to 
undergo rapid transformations in land, social 
structure and economic activity. The extension 
of  cities  into  peri-urban  areas  in  developing 
countries  is  often  uncontrolled,  and  such 
expansion can occur along a river or highway, 
as well as around a single metropolitan area. 
Due to a lack of regulation or planning, peri-
urban  areas 
face  severe  environmental, 

economic  and  property-related  challenges. 
For  instance,  due  to  a  lack  of  regulation, 
some  cities  release  waste  into  peri-urban 
areas without facing any legal consequences. 
Insufficient regulation can result in peri-urban 
agriculture  not  being  recognized  as  legal. 
Urban  sprawl  causes  property  speculation 
to increase land prices to unaffordable levels 
for  peri-urban  residents 
(United  Nations 
Population Fund, 2008).

is  not 

Many cities in developing countries expand 
with  little  focus  on  protecting  peri-urban 
water  systems  or  agricultural  areas.  Since 
the  peri-urban  area 
incorporated 
in  city  development  plans,  the  effects 
of  urbanization  on  city  fringes  are  not 
properly assessed. For example, many of the 
households in peri-urban zones are involved 
in  agriculture.  A  lack  of  understanding  of 
the  way  peri-urban  agriculture  is  sustained 
is  a  key  issue  affecting  peri-urban  farmers. 
Land  acquisition  and  the  fragmentation 
of  land  caused  by  urbanization  disrupt  the 
livelihood  of  farmers.  Their  vulnerability  is 
also  increased  by  industrial  pollution  and 
the 
lack  of  prioritization  of  agricultural 
programmes.  In  addition,  opportunities  for 
greater economic return by selling or leasing 
land  decrease  the  attractiveness  of  future 
peri-urban  agricultural  prospects  (Marshall 
et al., 2009).

Peri-urban zones on city fringes compete with 
urban residential and industrial demands for 

Box 17.  Sustainable housing programmes in practice

The United Nations Environment Programme is implementing a sustainable social housing initiative that was piloted in São 
Paulo and Bangkok in order to build social housing units that are both energy-eﬃcient and low-cost. 

Brazil and Mexico have housing programmes that aim to cover their housing shortages. Brazil’s My House My Life pro-
gramme provides incentives and subsidies to enable mortgages for low-income households and includes solar water heat-
ers in housing design. Mexico’s national housing programme subsidizes households for buying homes with pre-approved 
ecological technologies. In addition, the National Workers’ Housing Fund Institute provides green mortgages of up to $1,250 
to cover the cost of ecological technologies for low-income housing. The programme ﬁnances 22 technologies related to 
electricity, gas, water and health. The programme beneﬁted over 3 million people between 2007 and 2012 and is being 
expanded to the retroﬁtting of existing housing stock.

There are also successful examples of the upgrading of informal settlements. For example, settlements in Manaus, Brazil 
were upgraded through the construction of parks, transport infrastructure and sewage pipes, as well as the provision of 
basic services such as water, sanitation and electricity.

water. Growing urban zones endanger water 
resources  that  are  critical  for  agriculture.  A 
study  conducted  of  Chennai,  India,  by  the 
Social,  Technological  and  Environmental 
Pathways to Sustainability Centre based at the 
University of Sussex demonstrated that after 
a water-use agreement was signed between 
the urban water management authority and 
rural farmers for the use of groundwater, peri-
urban  farmers  were  vulnerable  to  increased 
urban  and  rural  demand  and  resulting 
price 
increases.  Moreover,  the  water-use 
agreement  had  counterproductive  effects 
on  all  parties.  As  urban  water  use  increased, 
excessive  groundwater  extraction 
led  to 
longer  droughts,  thereby  also  negatively 
impacting urban citizens due to reduced food 
production (Thapa et al., 2010). 

Water  scarcity  can  turn  into  a  serious  health 
issue for both rapidly growing cities and peri-
urban  zones.  The  lack  of  water  negatively 
affects  access  to  sanitation.  The  number  of 
inhabitants  in  cities  of  sub-Saharan  Africa 
without  access  to  adequate  sanitation  more 
than  doubled  between  1990  and  2010, 
reaching  180  million  (Food  and  Agriculture 
Organization  of  the  United  Nations,  2012). 
In  Maputo,  Mozambique,  20  per  cent  of  the 
population lacked access to potable water in 
2003. Half of the 10 million citizens of Jakarta, 
Indonesia had no access to potable water in 
2007 (UN-Habitat, 2012c). Water consumption 
is already excessive according to World Health 
Organization  norms  and  is  likely  to  increase 
further  in  cities  such  as  the  following:  Porto 
Alegre,  Brazil;  Nanjing,  China;  Johannesburg, 
South  Africa;  Bangkok;  Tunis,  Tunisia;  and 
Montevideo,  Uruguay.  Water  leakages  and 
abuse are severe problems in many countries. 
The  lack  of  water  can  thus  be  an  inhibiting 
factor to sound urban growth and peri-urban 
livelihood.

The  lack  of  healthy  nutrition  remains  an 
important  issue  in  growing  urban  areas  in 
developing  countries.  More  than  half  of 
the  urban  residents  in  Africa  live  in  slums, 
are  undernourished  and  have 
scarce 
employment  opportunities.  Commercial 
horticultural  production  of  fresh  fruits  and 
vegetables,  widely  practiced  in  peri-urban 

zones  especially  in  Africa,  risks  becoming 
unsustainable due to the lack of means and 
support.  Horticulture  and  food  production 
are  sources  of  nutrition  and  employment 
for  millions  of  urban  Africans,  yet  they 
receive 
little  recognition,  regulation  or 
support  from  their  Governments.  As  a 
result,  an  important  opportunity  for  the 
healthy  nutrition  of  urban  populations 
and  a  source  of  employment,  especially 
for  women  workers,  remains  underutilized 
(Food  and  Agriculture  Organization  of  the 
United Nations, 2012).

Science, technology and innovation for 
water and agriculture

Urban farming and market gardening

Science, technology and innovation increase 
the options for urban areas to become more 
self-sufficient  in  terms  of  nutrition.  In  Asia, 
Africa  and  Latin  America,  urban  farming  is 
already  a  livelihood  and  survival  strategy 
for  populations.  Urban  farming  can  also  be 
critical to supply food for disaster-struck urban 
zones.  Technologies  and  innovative  models 
are  available  to  promote  urban  farming. 
For  example,  school  gardens  represent  an 
innovative  means  to  promote  horticultural 
production,  while  simultaneously  improving 
the  quality  of  meals  at  schools,  providing 
practical  nutrition  education  and  increasing 
household  consumption.  In  addition,  family 
gardens  may  be  established  with  links  to 
markets through cooperatives. 

Integrating  urban  farming  into  urban  and 
peri-urban  planning  can  produce  multiple 
benefits. As the spread of urban zones results 
in a lack of space for food production, small-
scale peri-urban market gardening can make 
up  for  shortages  in  healthy,  fresh  food  and 
generate  employment.  Peri-urban 
farms 
can  reuse  urban  wastewater  for  irrigation 
purposes.  The  production  of 
fruit  and 
vegetables  in  small  private  farms  close  to 
cities can be less costly than bringing supplies 
from rural areas, due to lower transport costs. 
Such production can also help contain urban 
sprawl by creating urban green belts. box 18 
presents  an  example  of  the  implementation 
of market gardening in Mozambique.

IV. Sustainable urban resource management

Box 18.  Mozambique: Market gardening

Mozambique  demonstrates  a  good  example  of  policy-
making  for  successful  market  gardening  in  Africa.  The 
Government  created  green  zones  by  organizing  horti-
cultural cooperatives in the capital city of Maputo and 
other major cities after the civil war of the 1980s, which 
disrupted  food  supplies  and  increased  urban  unem-
ployment. These green zones produce a critical supply 
of fresh vegetables such as cabbage, lettuce, tomatoes, 
onions, eggplants, beans and pumpkins. Despite expo-
nential  growth  that  occurred  without  planning  or  ad-
ministrative control, most of the green zones have been 
protected by the city council, sustaining the livelihood of 
predominantly women farmers. Membership in farmers’ 
associations, which are aﬃliated with the General Union 
of Cooperatives, made it possible to protect the land of 
small-scale farmers from takeover by more wealthy farm-
ers. The cooperative-based structure also supports farm-
ers  with  ﬁnancing,  technical  assistance  and  market  ac-
cess. The green zones play a key economic role through 
the production of healthy food on a small scale, the crea-
tion of employment opportunities and the use of urban 
wastewater for irrigation purposes.

Water technologies

Since peri-urban communities in developing 
countries largely depend on agriculture, water 
is a key resource for their economic well-being. 
Water  storage,  irrigation  and  water-lifting 
technologies can help tackle water shortages. 
For  example,  Grundfos,  a  Danish  pump 
manufacturer,  developed  and  implemented 
a  solution  to  the  challenge  of  providing 
sustainable access to water for rural and peri-
urban communities in the developing world. 
The  system,  as  implemented  in  Kenya,  uses 
solar energy to activate a pump that extracts 
groundwater  and  distributes  it  through  a 
payment  system  that  is  managed  locally. 
The  revenue  from  the  pump  is  used  for 
maintaining the system. Grundfos is working 
on introducing the system to other countries 
(World  Business  Council 
for  Sustainable 
Development, 2012).

Phyto-remediation

Another  innovative  method  for  reusing  urban 
wastewater  is  phyto-remediation,  that  is,  the 
use of trees and plants to clean water, whereby 

a drainage system channels wastewater into a 
catchment that is filled with trees, which capture 
the water and hold the waste. The cleaned water 
is then reused for irrigation purposes. 

Policy considerations

Peri-urbanization  should  take  place  as  a 
planned,  managed 
transition.  Regional 
governance entities may be set up to establish 
a  framework  of  equitable  regulation  that 
protects  the  environment,  provides  basic 
services to the poor and resolves land disputes 
that may arise from urban sprawl. It may even 
be to the benefit of a region as a whole to set 
city land-expansion limits, as set for example by 
Portland, and to encourage more concentrated 
development.  Peri-urban  areas  can  benefit 
from social inclusion programmes that upgrade 
existing informal settlements and prevent the 
formation of new informal settlements through 
adequate spatial planning. Peri-urban areas can 
be integrated into the urban transport network 
as well. Soweto, a township in South Africa that 
was part of greater Johannesburg as a separate 
municipality,  was  successfully  integrated  into 
Johannesburg  as  a  result  of  a  planning  and 
investment effort that improved infrastructure, 
accessibility,  safety  and  public  spaces  and 
provided  new  economic  opportunities  (UN-
Habitat, 2012c).

Formal means of public participation in deci-
sion-making can play a key role in preventing 
resource conflicts between urban, peri-urban 
and rural stakeholders during the process of 
urbanization. Some countries have already es-
tablished successful forms of participation in 
urban decision-making. For example, in Brazil, 
more than 70 cities have a participatory bud-
get  system  that  allows  citizen  participation 
in  decisions  of  resource  allocation  (Marshall 
et  al.,  2009).  The  Coalition  to  Fight  Poverty 
(Mesa de Concertación para la Lucha Contra 
la Pobreza) in Peru is a council of Government, 
non-governmental  organization,  church  and 
community  organization  members  that  for-
mulates  short,  medium  and  long-term  pri-
orities  for  community  development  in  areas 
of  infrastructure,  health,  education,  security, 
recreation  and  employment  (Marshall  et  al., 
2009).

example,  in  1963  Singapore  centralized  its 
water management through a public utilities

thirds  of  Singapore’s  land  surface  became 
a  water  catchment  area  that  stored  water 
in  17  reservoirs.  Singapore  also  collects

Peri-urban  communities  may  benefit  from

map  their  composition,  interlinkages  and 
changes  induced  by  urbanization,  as  shown 
in the examples in box 19. Assessments can 
document  the  vulnerabilities  of  peri-urban 
zones with quantifiable data so that policies 
may  be  developed  to  maintain  landscapes 
and  ecosystems  that  are  important  for  food 
production,  maintaining  biodiversity  and 
tourism.

Following up on the millennium ecosystem assessment released in 2005, the satoyama–satoumi assessment, a land and 
marine ecosystem assessment, was conducted in Japan by the Institute of Advanced Studies of the United Nations Uni-
versity. The assessment was divided into ﬁve major regional clusters and identiﬁed the root causes of decline in both land 
and marine ecosystems and the possible courses of action to reverse this trend. The most important root causes were land 
use transformation, largely due to urbanization, and demographic changes such as ageing that made it harder to sustain 
the landscapes, while the decline of these ecosystems negatively aﬀected health and well-being in Japan. The assessment 
established  that  the  two  key  challenges  for  the  future  were  attracting  participation  by  citizens  and  non-governmental 
organizations in re-establishing land and marine ecosystem services and formulating economic incentives to protect non-
economic values in the landscapes.

Suncheon, a city on the south coast of the Republic of Korea, is a good example of an urban zone that has managed to 
protect its surrounding ecosystems. Despite being surrounded by cities prioritizing heavy industry, the city has invested in 
its ecosystems as of the late 1990s and turned Suncheon Bay into an award-winning ecotourism centre that attracts more 
than 2.3 million visitors per year. Although businesses and landowners disagreed with the plan at the beginning, it was im-
plemented with the mayor’s leadership and a clear vision of how the ecosystem approach would bring economic growth.

V. Recommendations and conclusion

to  achieve 

This  report  provides  guidance  on  science, 
technology  and  innovation-related  policies 
and  practices  that  can  lead  to  sustainable 
urbanization  by  producing  wider  economic, 
social  and  environmental  benefits  for  cities. 
The  report  details  how  cities  that  prioritize 
sustainable  growth  patterns  can  improve 
employment  and  competitiveness,  enhance 
social  cohesion  and  create  a  healthy  and 
liveable  urban  environment.  As  seen  in  the 
examples provided, many cities have achieved 
success  on  a  partial  basis  by  implementing 
some  of  the  related  technologies,  yet  the 
same cities may have failed in other areas. 
The  best  way 
sustainable 
urbanization is for a city to implement integrated 
comprehensive policies that take into account 
all aspects such as spatial planning, mobility and 
buildings, among others. Cities need to embed 
sustainability  in  their  urban  plans  and  urban 
development policies. If a sustainability mindset 
is  included  in  all  sectors,  there  is  a  higher 
likelihood  of  achieving  success.  Mobilizing 
citizens  to  support  this  mindset  is  critical, 
since  without  the  participation  of  citizens, 
policymakers cannot achieve objectives such as 
sustainable  resource  management.  Ultimately, 
citizens  are  the  ones  who  make  decisions  on 
consumption patterns.
In  order 
technology  and 
innovation  to  be  effective  in  bringing  about 
positive  responses  in  cities  in  developing 
countries, there is a need for strong diffusion 
mechanisms. 
and 
innovation are widely available for sustainable 
urbanization  and 
tools  are 
constantly  improving.  Most  significant  for 
developing  countries  is  the  need  to  ensure 
that  diffusion  takes  place  where  needed. 
Solutions need to travel quickly from creators 
to beneficiaries. However, as with the adoption 
of  science, 
innovation-
related  solutions,  diffusion  requires  action 
on  multiple  fronts.  Diffusion  models  should 
include  capital  accumulation  and  the  local 
capacity development of beneficiaries.

inadequate  and 
insufficient  to  meet  the  needs  of  rapidly 
growing  populations  and  economies.  The 
lack  of  affordable  housing  furnished  with 
basic  services  such  as  water,  sanitation 
and  electricity,  especially  for  lower-income 
groups, results in informal shelters being built 
with  no  infrastructure,  little  sanitation  and 
no  compliance  with  planning  or  building 
regulations.  Least  developed  countries  have 
particularly  high  urban  growth  rates  and 
require  special  consideration  with  regard 
to  meeting  shelter,  sanitation  and  other 
infrastructure  needs.  Most  least  developed 
countries  are  located  in  sub-Saharan  Africa 
and  South-East  Asia,  where  natural  disasters 
pose constant risks.
Science,  technology  and  innovation-related 
choices in developing country contexts differ 
from  those  in  developed  countries  due  to 
limitations  in  human  resources,  know-how 
and  financing,  among  others.  Constraints 
are  particularly  acute 
least  developed 
countries,  limiting  their  ability  to  cope  with 
the  challenges  of  rapid  urbanization  and 
to  ensure  even  the  bare  minimum  –  food, 
water  and  electricity  –  needed  to  sustain 
the livelihoods of their citizens. Nevertheless, 
science,  technology  and  innovation  have 
a  key  role  to  play  in  fostering  sustainable 
urbanization  in  the  developing  world.  The 
particular  nature  of  urbanization 
least 
developed  countries  requires  customized 
models  of  delivering  science,  technology 
and innovation-related solutions, not least by 
tapping into indigenous knowledge.
As demonstrated in this report, many of the 
technologies  that  are  useful  in  the  urban 
context  in  developing  countries  can  be  low 
technology and therefore may not necessarily 
require high financial resources or investments. 
This 
that  science, 
technology  and  innovation  for  sustainable

This  report  provides  examples  of  how  local

buildings  that  are  not  necessarily  expensive. 
Many  innovations  originate  in  developing 
countries, yet there is a need for mechanisms 
to  implement  them  more  widely.  In  least 
developed  countries,  urbanization  rates  are 
still relatively low compared to other countries. 
Making 
ideas  on  urbanization 
available  to  least  developed  countries  can 
help  their  cities  follow  the  best  path  from 
the start and minimize the cost of correcting 
unhealthy urban practices later on.

innovative 

The examples given in this report illustrate the 
benefits of establishing strong links between 
national  policies  on  science,  technology 
and 
innovation,  particularly  research  and 
development,  and 
specific  urbanization 
issues,  in  order  to  develop  local  solutions 
that  address  local  needs.  The  report  shows 
how  developed  countries  are  taking  the 
lead  with  regard  to  innovative  regulation  in 
the urban context. This may therefore be an 
area  for  increased  cooperation  among  cities 
in the future. Developing countries and least 
developed  countries  may  need  assistance 
in  putting 
in  place  beneficial  business 
models  and  urban  governance  structures 
that  can  popularize  science,  technology 
and 
low 
technology or innovation forms. For instance, 
while bicycling is a technology that has been 
available for over a century, encouraging the 
wide-scale  adoption  of  bicycling  in  a  city 
through  bicycle-sharing  systems  integrated

Council,  2013).  Technical  cooperation  on 
innovative  regulations  may  therefore  speed 
up the process of implementing sustainable 
practices  on  a  much  wider  scale  in  growing 
cities in developing countries.

Policy implications that may be derived from 
this report to address the specific urbanization 
needs  of  developing  countries  and  least 
developed  countries  are  further  detailed  in 
the following sections.

V. a. Urbanization as a key  

 
  consideration in national    
  innovation systems

Cities  are  one  of  the  greatest  innovation 
tools developed by humans. They encourage 
innovation through contact between people, 
which may be either planned or serendipitous. 
Creative 
inhabitants  of  cities  constantly 
design  novel  solutions. The  same  applies  to 
inhabitants  of  informal  settlements,  where 
people  must  embody  an  entrepreneurial 
spirit  for  their  daily  survival.  It  is  important 
for  developing  countries  to  harness  this 
innovative spirit and scale frugal innovation for 
the benefit of the larger population. Increasing 
the  possibilities  of  public  participation  in 
urban  decision-making  may  enable  this,  as 
seen  in  some  of  the  examples  provided  in 
this  report.  Urban  citizens  are  best  placed 
to  work  with  municipalities  and 
identify 
science,  technology  and  innovation-related 
requirements. Fostering cooperation between 
national councils on science, technology and 
innovation  and  local  governments  to  solve 
urban problems is also beneficial.

Furthermore, if the national innovation system 
of a country prioritizes urbanization issues, this 
may  be  a  great  benefit  for  its  development 
as,  more  often  than  not,  urbanization  and 
development occur in parallel. Mainstreaming 
sustainability  into  urban  development  plans 
from  the  start  can  help  to  avoid  costly  and 
difficult  policy  adjustments  later  on.  While

environments  than  in  areas  with  constant

  sector and civil society

This 
the  different 
areas  in  which  public–private  partnerships, 
particularly in developing countries, can have 
a lasting impact on sustainable urbanization. 
Such  business  models  are  valuable  in  terms 
of scaling the innovation generated by small 
organizations  with  the  means  available  to 
large  organizations.  Local  governments  can 
also  make  public  resources,  such  as  open 
data,  available  to  private-sector  enterprises

Sustainability  examples  from  several  cities 
show  that  applying  technology  in  highly 
populated  urban  environments  requires  a 
sound  business  model  in  order  to  succeed. 
Popular adoption of new urban technologies 
depends on whether they can replace current 
habits  and  practices  without  disruption  or 
economic disadvantages. City managements

can 

assist  in  matching  the  sustainability  needs 
of  cities  with  possible  solutions  from  the 
private sector. Municipalities can also receive 
support  from  national  Governments  and 
international  organizations  to  create  more 
favourable  conditions  so  that  sustainable 
practices  do  not  remain  expensive  subsidy-
dependent  options  but  are  turned  into  real 
business opportunities (Economic and Social 
Commission for Asia and the Pacific et al., 2011 
and United Nations Environment Programme, 
2011).

Particularly in the context of least developed 
countries,  the  social  inclusion  of  slum  areas 
is  a  necessity.  Social  entrepreneurship  is  an 
emerging  business  model  that  addresses 
societal  needs  by  bringing 
together 
community  innovators  with  private  sector 
entrepreneurs  to  fund  social  innovation  as 
a  financially  viable  business.  For  example, 
open-data  initiatives  can  help  populations 
map  their  neighbourhoods.  Cooperation 
initiatives  that 
include  non-governmental 
organizations  can  map  slums  and  survey 
households  to  integrate  slums  into  future 
urban development plans.

International organizations can contribute to 
standard  setting  and  technical  cooperation 
for  sustainable  urbanization.  They  can  raise 
awareness among urban policymakers of the 
role of science, technology and innovation for 
sustainable urban development in developing 
countries,  with  a  special  focus  on 
least 
developed countries, by serving as a forum for 
the sharing of good practices and experiences. 
In  particular,  international  organizations  can 
share  and  analyse  evidence  of  successful 
examples  of  local  innovation  models  that 
provide solutions to pressing urban challenges 
based on science, technology and innovation, 
including  serving  as  incubators,.  They  can 
also  share  and  analyse  evidence  of  business 
models that scale innovative interdisciplinary 
solutions  to  city  management  and  provide 
them  to  beneficiaries.  Formal  cooperation 
and  technology  transfer  mechanisms  can 
be  established  within  relevant  international 
organizations, such as the Clean Development 
Mechanism of the United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change.

38

Science, Technology and Innovation for Sustainable Urbanization

V. c. Innovative governance 

  and financing models

The  highlighted  case  studies  from  around  the 
world demonstrate the need for cities to form a 
coalition of public, private and civil society actors 
and  multilevel  governance  models  in  their 
transition to sustainability. Since policy changes 
related  to  prioritizing  public  transport,  saving 
energy  and  efficient  buildings,  among  others, 
affect all stakeholders that take part in urban life, 
they require consensus-based decision-making 
to succeed. Cities need to envisage and put in 
place  legal  participation  mechanisms.  Broad 
public participation can help gather input and 
promote consensus on urban projects, leading 
to cities that are more socially inclusive.

Sectors  of  urban  management  are  interlinked. 
The  absence  of  cross-sectoral  policies  can 
lead  to  fragmented  governance,  which 
is 
counterproductive and can lead to unexpected 
and unwanted outcomes. For example, rebound 
effects can occur in cases where the introduction 
of energy-saving technologies actually leads to 
an increase in per capita energy consumption 
(United Nations Environment Programme, 2011). 
Local  governments  in  developing  countries 
can  launch  cross-sectoral  sustainability  goals 
covering mobility, energy, buildings, water and 
waste. Science, technology and innovation have 
an  essential  role  to  play  in  addressing  cross-
sectoral  sustainability  challenges.  For  instance, 
information and communications technologies 
can be used to bring together data from different 
city  departments  and  enable  coordinated 
simultaneous responses to challenges.

Science,  technology  and 
innovation  are 
important  for  urban  economic  dynamism 
and  employment.  Urban  economies  need 
to innovate and take a regional approach in 
order  to  provide  employment  for  incoming 
populations. Assessing the advantages of the 
region and ensuring the integration of a city 
with its region are necessary to generate new 
employment. Formal governance mechanisms 
that enhance cooperation between national, 
regional  and  local  governments  can  assist 
spatial  planning  at  the  regional  level.  Such 
governance models may even be developed 

across  countries.  An  overall  view  of  the 
regional  economic  landscape  can  help  in 
forming a vibrant economic cluster. Science, 
technology  and  innovation  make  it  possible 
to  undertake  regional  work  and  exchange 
ideas more easily. Examples include regional 
planning  and  governance  models  that  are 
being  practiced  in  different  urban  hubs  in 
Asia,  including  the  Malacca  Straits  Diagonal, 
the Pearl River Delta and Metropolitan Manila 
(International  Society  of  City  and  Regional 
Planners, 2012).

support 

for 

financial 

technologies 

Public 
science, 
technology and innovation-related initiatives 
and  start-ups  oriented  towards  sustainable 
urbanization solutions is important. New forms 
of  financial  services  are  emerging,  driven  by 
the opportunities created by information and 
communications 
(Robinson, 
2012).  For  example,  crowdfunding,  peer-to-
peer  lending,  sustainable  investment  funds 
and  local  and  electronic  currencies  are  all 
innovations  that  can  be  used  to  finance 
projects related to sustainable urbanization. In 
addition,  new  sources  of  investment  capital, 
such  as  retirement  and  sovereign  wealth 
funds,  can  finance  science,  technology  and 
innovation-based solutions, in particular at a 
smaller scale, for sustainable urbanization.

V. d. Inter-city learning as an    

  opportunity area

Cities  of  the  world  learn  from  one  another. 
City-to-city knowledge exchanges on science, 
technology  and  innovation  facilitate  both 
North-South  and  South-South  collaboration 
in  sharing  experiences  on  issues  such  as 
urban  planning  and  design,  mobility  and 
efficient  urban  resource  management.  For 
example,  since  the  European  Union–Latin 
America  and  Caribbean  summit  in  Madrid 
on 18 May 2010, the two regions have been 
undertaking 
joint  efforts  on  smart  cities, 
among  other  topics.  A  mapping  exercise  is 
being conducted to identify priorities on new 
biregional cooperation possibilities for smart 
cities. The objective is to constitute a database 
of  biregional  projects  related  to  information 
and  communications  technologies,  as  well 

V. Recommendations and conclusion

as applications and technologies deployed in 
thematic areas including smart cities to allow 
for  the  identification  of  twinning  projects, 
funding 
instruments  and  collaborating 
institutions.  It  is  based  on  an  exploratory 
survey  of  cooperation  on  information  and 
communications 
through 
contact  with  national  funding  agencies  in 
both regions.

technologies 

At  the  level  of  mayors  and  municipalities, 
barriers  between  North  and  South  are  less 
significant, since solutions to urban problems 
can  originate  from  anywhere.  Cities  help 
break  barriers  to  learning  among  countries 
and regions. For example, the bus rapid transit 
system in Curitiba has been reapplied in many 
parts  of  the  world,  including  in  developed 
countries.  Accelerating 
learning 
is  a  key  opportunity  for  diffusing  science, 
technology and innovation on a much wider 
scale  towards  sustainable  urbanization 
in 
developing countries. 

inter-city 

Multilateral  and  bilateral  technology  banks 
can be established to speed up the transfer of 
knowledge and experience on projects that are 
implemented  in  cities  with  similar  problems. 
International 
local  government  networks 
such as Cities Alliance, the C40 Cities Climate 
Leadership  Group,  the  International  Council 
for  Local  Environmental 
Initiatives–Local 
Governments  for  Sustainability,  United  Cities 
and Local Governments and the World Urban 
Campaign  coordinated  by  UN-Habitat  are 
already playing an important role in increasing 
awareness  of  sustainability,  circulating  best 
practices  and  providing  a  platform  for  joint 
projects. Action at a mayoral level is effective 
since  mayors  regulate,  operate  or  even  own 
infrastructure  such  as  roads,  buildings  and 
street  lights,  as  well  as  public  transport,  land 
use planning and waste collection.

The  nature  of  urbanization  may  change, 
yet  it  remains  a  continuously  evolving 
process. In order to make this continuous 
process sustainable, cities need to consider

options  whenever  they  embark  on  new

They  should  continuously  benefit  from 
ecological  solutions  as 
they  emerge, 
perpetually  replacing  obsolete  and  old 
infrastructure  with  more  efficient  and 
environmentally 
infrastructure. 
They need to have mechanisms that assess 
the  evolution  of  new  technologies  and 
innovative  means  of  urban  governance, 
in  order  to  gradually  integrate  these  into 
their domain.

friendly 

Cities  are  already  thinking  of  ways  to 
repurpose  their  obsolete 
infrastructure. 
For example, New York City is piloting the 
use of its 12,500 public telephone booths 
as  information  nodes.  A  similar  pilot  that 
reuses public telephone booths as electric 
automobile-charging 
is  being 
run  by  Telekom  Austria  (Burnham,  2013). 
Such examples are encouraging proof that 
there is potential for cities at any stage of 
development  to  innovate  and  learn  from 
other cities.
