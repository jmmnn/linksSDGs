Foreword

The emerging picture of the 21st century city fits 

many  descriptions.    Some  are  centres  of  rapid 
industrial  growth  and  wealth  creation,  often 
accompanied  by  harmful  waste  and  pollution.  
Others  are  characterized  by  stagnation,  urban  decay  and 
rising social exclusion and intolerance.  Both scenarios point 
to the urgent need for new, more sustainable approaches to 
urban development.  Both argue for greener, more resilient 
and inclusive towns and cities that can help combat climate 
change and resolve age-old urban inequalities. 

The 2010/11 State of the World’s Cities Report, “Bridging the 
Urban  Divide”  examines  the  social,  economic,  cultural  and 
political drivers of urban poverty and deprivation.  It argues 
that  much  inequality  and  injustice  stems  from  inadequate 
policy-making and planning by local authorities and central 
governments  alike.    Typical  remedies  include  removing 
barriers  that  prevent  access  to  land,  housing,  infrastructure 
and  basic  services,  and  facilitating  rather  than  inhibiting 

participation and citizenship.  The report also emphasizes that 
lasting gains are best achieved through a combination of local 
action and national enabling policies.

As  we  grapple  with  old  and  new  challenges  in  a  rapidly 
urbanizing world, this timely report can help inform research, 
policy dialogue and development planning for years to come.  
I commend its findings to all who are working to create the 
just, green and dynamic environments that the inhabitants of 
the world’s towns and cities need to thrive.

Introduction

This  State  of  the  World’s  Cities  Report  (2010/11) 

is  published  in  a  very  important  year  –  a  key 
milestone that marks the halfway point towards the 
deadline for the “slum target” of the Millennium 
Development  Goals.  Government  efforts  to  reduce  the 
number of slum dwellers show some positive results. 

Achieving  sustainable  urban  development  is  likely  to  prove 
impossible if the urban divide is allowed not only to persist, 
but to continue growing, opening up an enormous gap, even 
in  some  cities  a  gulf,  an  open  wound,  which  can  produce 
social instability or at least generate high social and economic 
costs not only for the urban poor, but for society at large. 

According to new estimates presented in this Report, between 
the  year  2000  and  2010  over  200  million  people  in  the 
developing world will have been lifted out of slum conditions. 
In other words, governments have collectively exceeded the 
Millennium Target by at least a multiple of two. 
 
However, this achievement is not uniformly distributed across 
regions. Success is highly skewed towards the more advanced 
emerging economies, while poorer countries have not done 
as well. For this reason, there is no room for complacency, 
because  in  the  course  of  the  same  years  the  number  of 
slum dwellers increased by six million every year. Based on 
these trends it is expected that the world’s slum population 
will continue to grow if no corrective action is taken in the 
coming years.

This edition of the Report underlines the choices available to 
policymakers  across  the  range  of  economic,  social,  cultural 
and political challenges that are needed to bridge the urban 
divide. It charts a new course of action, with the steps and 
levers needed to achieve a more inclusive city, emphasizing 
the need for comprehensive and integrated responses that go 
beyond a compartmentalized, short-term perspective. 

The  Report  benefits  enormously  from  context-specific 
knowledge drawing in large part on regional perspectives and 
information, in a bid to inspire evidence-based local policy 
responses. In that sense, this Report contributes to bridge the 
gap between scientific information and societal action, which 
is a simple, but fundamental requisite, to promote equity and 
sustainability for more harmonious cities.

This Report highlights the unprecedented challenges which 
urbanization throws at the world’s cities today – particularly 
in the South – and the attendant urban divide which we all 
have to address collectively to stem the multiple deprivations 
that  follow  from  unequal  growth.  These  challenges  include 
grinding  poverty,  environmental  degradation,  income  in-
equalities,  historical  socio-economic  inequalities,  marginal-
ization and various forms of exclusion.

overview and
Key Findings

The world is inexorably becoming urban. By 2030 

all developing regions, including Asia and Africa, 
will have more people living in urban than rural 
areas. In the next 20 years, Homo sapiens, “the wise 
human”,  will  become  Homo  sapiens  urbanus  in  virtually  all 
regions of the planet. 

Cities – whether large or small, whole neighbourhoods, city 
centres, suburban or peri-urban areas – offer human beings 
the  potential  to  share  urban  spaces,  participate  in  public 
and private events and exercise both duties and rights. These 
opportunities  in  turn  make  it  possible  to  cultivate  societal 
values and define modes of governance and other rules that 
enable human beings to produce goods, trade with others and 
get access to resources, culture, and various forms of riches or 
well-being.

Cities can be open or closed with regard to residents’ ability 
to access, occupy and use urban space, and even produce new 
spaces to meet their needs. Cities can also be open or closed 
in terms of residents’ ability to access decisions and participate 
in various types of interaction and exchange. Some residents 
find the city as the place where social and political life takes 
place, knowledge is created and shared, and various forms of 
creativity and art are developed; other residents find that the 
city denies them these opportunities. Cities can therefore be 
places  of  inclusion  and  participation,  but  they  can  be  also 
places of exclusion and marginalization. 

The Urban Divide

Cities  are  constantly  changing.  They  are  built,  rebuilt, 
transformed,  occupied  by  different  groups,  and  used 
for  different  functions.  In  the  search  for  better  spatial 
organization for higher returns, more efficient economies of 
scale and other agglomeration benefits, cities generate various 
degrees of residential differentiation. In most urban areas of 
the developed world, the segmentation of spaces for different 
uses  is  relatively  visible,  although  social  heterogeneity  and 
mixed uses remain widespread. In contrast, in many cities of 

the developing world, the separation of uses and degrees of 
prosperity  are  so  obvious  that  the  rich  live  in  well-serviced 
neighbourhoods,  gated  communities  and  well-built  formal 
settlements,  whereas  the  poor  are  confined  to  inner-city  or 
peri-urban informal settlements and slums. 

Cities, particularly in the South, are far from offering equal 
conditions and opportunities to their resident communities. 
The majority of the urban population is prevented from, or 
restricted in, the fulfillment of their basic needs because of 
their economic, social or cultural status, ethnic origins, gender 
or  age.  Others,  a  minority,  benefit  from  the  economic  and 
social progress that is typically associated with urbanization. 
In some of these cities, the urban divide between “haves” and 
“have nots” opens up a gap – if not, on occasion, a chasm, 
an open wound – which can produce social instability or at 
least generate high social and economic costs not only for the 
urban poor, but for society at large. 

Cities are, more often than not, divided by invisible borders. 
These split the “centre” from the “off-centre”, or the “high” 
from the “low”, as the urban divide is colloquially referred to 
in many parts of the South. These man-made demarcations 
are  often  completely  different  along  a  spatial  and  social 
continuum,  reflecting  the  only  difference  experienced  by 
their  respective  populations:  socio-economic  status.  Closer 
assessment of the urban space in many cities of the developing 
world  sheds  forensic  light  on  the  fragmentation  of  society, 
marking out differences in the way space and opportunities 
are produced, appropriated, transformed and used. Some areas 
feature  significant  infrastructure,  well-kept  parks,  gardens 
and up-market residential areas. In contrast, other areas are 
characterized  by  severe  deprivation,  inadequate  housing, 
deficient services, poor recreation and cultural facilities, urban 
decay, and scarce capital investment in public infrastructure. 
These tangible differences in access come as symptoms of the 
intangible  yet  enduring  divisions  in  society  that  apportion 
unequal opportunities and liberties across residents.

The physical divide takes the form of social, cultural and 
economic exclusion. Large sections of society are frequently

excluded on grounds of predetermined attributes over which 
they  have  no  control  at  all,  such  as  gender,  age,  race,  or 
ethnicity,  or  over  which  they  have  very  little  control,  such 
as where they live (slums vs. rich neighbourhoods) or what 
they own (income and social status). However, this narrow 
perspective overlooks the actual and potential contributions 
of marginalized groups to the building of cities and nations, 
and therefore can only delay progress toward sustainable and 
inclusive development. 

The urban divide is the face of injustice and a symptom of 
systemic dysfunction. A society cannot claim to be harmoni-
ous or united if large numbers of people cannot meet their 
basic  needs  while  others  live  in  opulence.  A  city  cannot  be 
harmonious if some groups concentrate resources and oppor-
tunities while others remain impoverished and deprived. 

Yet cities are not – and should not be – “the world which 
man created, and therefore the world in which he is hence-
forth condemned to live”. Cities are, on the contrary, vehicles 
for social change: places where new values, beliefs and ideas 
can forge a different growth paradigm that promotes rights 
and opportunities for all members of society. Based not only 
on moral and ethical arguments but also practical access to 
opportunity, the concept of an “inclusive city”, or “a city for 
all”, encompasses the social and economic benefits of greater 
equality, promoting positive outcomes for each and every in-
dividual in society.

Urban Trends 

Urbanization: A Positive Force for Transformation 

By  the  mid-20th  century,  three  out  of  10  people  on 
the  planet  lived  in  urban  areas.  At  that  time,  and  over  the 
following  three  decades,  demographic  expansion  was  at  its 
fastest in cities around the world. Subsequently, a slow but 
steady  process  of  deceleration  took  over.  Today,  half  the 
world’s population lives in urban areas and by the middle of 
this  century  all  regions  will  be  predominantly  urban,  with 
the tipping point in Eastern Africa anticipated slightly after 
2050. According to current projections, virtually the whole of 
the world’s population growth over the next 30 years will be 
concentrated in urban areas.

Although  many  countries  have  adopted  an  ambivalent 
or  hostile  attitude  to  urbanization,  often  with  negative 
consequences, it appears today that this worldwide process is 
inevitable. It is also generally positive, as it brings a number of 
fundamental changes, namely: (a) in the employment sector, 
from agriculture-based activities to mass production and service 
industries; (b) in societal values and modes of governance; (c) 
in the configuration and functionality of human settlements; 
(d) in the spatial scale, density and activities of cities; (e) in 
the composition of social, cultural and ethnic groups; and (f) 
in  the  extension  of  democratic  rights,  particularly  women’s 
empowerment.

Using a wealth of significant and comparative new data, this 
Report identifies the trends, both similar and dissimilar, that 
characterize urbanization in various regions and countries; it 
does so against a background of significant recent changes, 
such  as  accelerated  expansion  or  shrinking  of  cities,  ageing 
populations,  urban  and  regional  dynamics  and  regional 
location  factors,  among  others.  In  this  respect,  it  is  worth 
mentioning two significant trends that can either help bridge 
or exacerbate the urban divide:

•	 Cities  are  merging  together  to  create  urban  settlements 
on a massive scale. These configurations take the form of 
mega-regions,  urban  corridors  and  city-regions.  They  are 
emerging in various parts of the world, turning into spatial 
units that are territorially and functionally bound by eco-
nomic,  political,  socio-cultural,  and  ecological  systems.  
Cities in clusters, corridors and regions are becoming the 
new engines of both global and regional economies, and 
they  reflect  the  emerging  links  between  urban  expan-
sion  and  new  patterns  of  economic  activity.  However,  as 
they  improve  inter-connectivity  and  create  new  forms  of 
interdependence  among  cities,  these  configurations  can 
also  result  in  unbalanced  regional  and  urban  develop-
ment as they strengthen ties to existing economic centres, 
rather  than  allow  for  more  diffused  spatial  development. 

The challenge here is for local authorities and regional governments 
to adopt policies that maximize the benefits of urbanization and 
respond to these forms of inter-connectivity and city interdependence. 
The rationale is to promote regional economic development growth, 
as well as to anticipate and manage the negative consequences of 
urban/regional growth, such as asymmetrical regional and urban 
development that has the potential to compound the urban divide.  

•	 More and more people both in the North and South are 
moving  outside  the  city  to  “satellite”  or  dormitory  cities 
and  suburban  neighbourhoods,  taking  advantage  of 
accommodation that can be more affordable than in central 
areas, with lower densities and sometimes a better quality 
of life in certain ways. Spatial expansion of cities is triggered 
not only by residents’ preference for a suburban lifestyle, 
but also by land regulation crises, lack of control over peri-
urban areas, weak planning control over land subdivisions, 
improved  or  expanded  commuting  technologies  and 
services, as well as greater population mobility. Whether it 
takes the form of “peripherization” (informal settlements) 
or  “suburban  sprawl”  (residential  zones  for  high-  and 
middle-income 
generates 
negative environmental, economic and social externalities. 
In  developing  countries,  the  phenomenon  comes  mainly 
as an escape from inadequate governance, lack of planning 
and  poor  access  to  amenities.  Rich  and  poor  seek  refuge 
outside the city, which generates further partitioning of the 
physical and social space.

The Wealth of Cities 

The  prosperity  of  nations  is  intimately  linked  to  the 
prosperity of their cities. No country has ever achieved sustained 
economic  growth  or  rapid  social  development  without 
urbanizing (countries with the highest per capita income tend 
to  be  more  urbanized,  while  low-income  countries  are  the 
least urbanized). Thanks to superior productivity, urban-based 
enterprises contribute large shares of gross domestic product 
(GDP). In other countries, it is a group of cities that accounts 
for  a  significant  share  of  national  GDP.  The  clustering  of 
cities  into  mega-regions,  urban  corridors  and  city-regions 
operating  as  single  economic  entities  sets  in  motion  self-
reinforcing,  cumulative  growth  patterns  that  are  making  a 
significant  contribution  to  the  world’s  economic  activity. 
High urban densities reduce transaction costs, make public 
spending  on  infrastructure  and  services  more  economically 
viable, and facilitate generation and diffusion of knowledge, 
all of which are important for growth. Hand in hand with 
economic  growth,  urbanization  has  helped  reduce  overall 
poverty by providing new opportunities, raising incomes and 
increasing the numbers of livelihood options for both rural 
and urban populations. Urbanization, therefore, does indeed 
play a positive role in overall poverty reduction, particularly 
where  supported  by  well-adapted  policies.  However,  when 
accompanied by weak economic growth, or when distributive 
policies  are  nonexistent  or  ineffective,  urbanization  results 
in local concentration of poor people rather than significant 
poverty reduction.

Cities  have  the  potential  to  make  countries  rich  because  they 
provide  the  economies  of  scale  and  proximity  that  generate 
enhanced productivity. Economic growth can turn urban centres 
into  effective  “poverty  fighters”  if  benefits  and  opportunities 
are  redistributed  through  adequate  policies.  Cities  can  also 
significantly reduce rural poverty. 

Slums: Good News is Shadowed by Bad News  

In many developing countries, urban expansion has often 
been  characterized  by  informality,  illegality  and  unplanned 
settlements.  Above  all,  urban  growth  has  been  strongly 
associated  with  poverty  and  slum  growth.  Fortunately,  a 
number of countries have, to some extent, managed to curb 
the  further  expansion  of  slums  and  to  improve  the  living 
conditions prevailing there. Uneven as they may have been 

around the world, efforts to narrow the most unacceptable 
form  of  urban  divide  as  represented  by  slums  have  yielded 
some positive results. According to UN-HABITAT estimates, 
between the year 2000 and 2010, a total 227 million people in 
the developing world will have moved out of slum conditions. 
In other words, governments have collectively exceeded the 
slum target of Millennium Development Goal 7 by at least 
2.2 times, and 10 years ahead of the agreed 2020 deadline. 

Asia  stood  at  the  forefront  of  successful  efforts  to  reach 
the  slum  target,  with  governments  in  the  region  together 
improving the lives of an estimated 172 million slum dwellers 
between the year 2000 and 2010; this represents 74 per cent 
of the total number of urban residents in the world who no 
longer suffer from inadequate housing. China and India have 
improved  the  lives  of  more  slum  dwellers  than  any  other 
countries,  having  together  lifted  no  less  than  125  million 
people  out  of  slum  conditions  in  the  same  period.  After 
China and India, the most significant improvements in slum 
conditions  in  Asia  were  recorded  in  Indonesia, Turkey  and 
Viet Nam. At sub-regional level, the greatest advances were 
recorded in Southern and Eastern Asia (73 and 72 million 
people, respectively), followed by South-East Asia (33 million). 
In contrast, Western Asia failed to make a contribution, as the 
number of slum dwellers in the sub-region increased by 12 
million.

Across  Africa,  the  lives  of  an  estimated  24  million  slum 
dwellers  have  improved  in  the  last  decade,  representing  12 
per  cent  of  the  global  effort  to  narrow  this  form  of  urban 
divide. North Africa is the only sub-region in the developing 
world where both the number (8.7 million) and proportion 
of slum dwellers have steadily declined (from 20 to 13 per 
cent). Egypt, Morocco and Tunisia were the most successful 
countries. In sub-Saharan Africa, though, the total proportion 
of the urban population living in slums has decreased by only 
5 per cent (or 17 million people). Ghana, Senegal, Uganda, 
Rwanda and Guinea were the most successful countries in the 
sub-region, reducing the proportions of slum dwellers by over 
one-fifth in the last decade. 

Some 13 per cent of the progress made towards the global 
slum  target  occurred  in  Latin  America  and  the  Caribbean, 
where  an  estimated  30  million  people  have  moved  out  of 
slum conditions since the year 2000. Over the past decade, 
Argentina, Colombia and Dominican Republic have been able 
to reduce their proportions of slum dwellers by over a third, 
making them the most successful countries in the region.

The  successful  municipalities  took  the  responsibility  for  slum 
reduction  squarely  on  their  shoulders,  backing  commitments 
with  bold  policy  reforms,  and  preventing  future  slum  growth 
with equitable planning and economic policies. Recognition of 
the  existence  of  slums  must  combine  with  long-term  political 
commitment backed by adequate budget resources, policy reforms 
and institutional strengthening, strong monitoring and scaling up 
of successful local projects, if slums are to be tackled effectively.

Improving the lives of slum dwellers is the best way to achieve all 
the Millennium Development Goals. Improved housing conditions 
and provision of water and sanitation will not only save lives among 
the very poor, but also support progress in education and health.  

Over the past 10 years, the proportion of the urban population 
living  in  slums  in  the  developing  world  has  declined  from 
39 per cent in the year 2000 to an estimated 32 per cent in 
2010. And yet the urban divide endures, because in absolute 
terms  the  numbers  of  slum  dwellers  have  actually  grown 
considerably,  and  will  continue  to  rise  in  the  near  future. 
Between the year 2000 and 2010, the urban population in 
the  developing  world  increased  by  an  estimated  average  of 
58 million per annum; this includes 6 million who were not 
able to improve their conditions and joined the ranks of slum 
dwellers.  At  the  same  time,  UN-HABITAT  estimates  that 
through  upgrading  or  prevention  of  informal  settlements, 
developing countries lifted an annual 22 million people out 
of slum conditions between the year 2000 and 2010. Based 
on these trends, the world’s slum population is expected to 
reach 889 million by 2020. 

Good  news  is  coming  with  bad  news.  UN-HABITAT 
estimates  confirm  that  the  progress  made  on  the  slum 
target  has  not  been  enough  to  counter  the  demographic 
expansion 
in  the  developing 
world.  In  this  sense,  efforts  to  reduce  the  numbers  of

slum  dwellers  are  neither 

informal  settlements 

in 

Against  this  background,  it  is  up  to  national  governments 
to  revise  and  increase  the  slum  target  to  a  number  that  takes 
into  account  both  existing  and  potential  new  slums.  Those 
nations  that  have  been  performing  well  so  far  must  maintain 
or  increase  efforts  to  improve  the  living  conditions  of  slum 
dwellers, while providing adequate alternatives to prevent new 
slum  formation.  Those  governments  that  are  falling  behind  in 
slum  reduction  must  bring  radical  changes  to  their  attitudes 
and  policies  vis-à-vis  slums  and  urban  poverty  at  large.  

Efforts must focus on those regions facing the greatest development 
challenges in slum reduction: sub-Saharan Africa and Western 
Asia.  Others  in  need  of  special  attention  are  those  countries 
which,  for  all  their  overall  progress  toward  the  slum  target  at 
national  level,  are  still  faced  with  huge  spatial  inequalities  in 
some regions and cities. Finally, efforts are also required in those 
cities which, although they are doing relatively well, still feature 
large pockets of poverty where people remain marginalized.

Divided Cities

The urban divide does not just refer to a fragmented space 
or  a  community  riven  by  socio-economic  disparities.  More 
often  than  not,  economic  lines  of  divide  tend  to  coincide 
with social, cultural and political barriers. Various forms of 
exclusion  continue  to  marginalize  vast  amounts  of  human 
capital ready to be mobilized for the sake of a sustainable city. 

A  divided  city  is  one  that  fails  to  accommodate  its  poorer 
residents,  regardless  of  the  social  and  cultural  riches  they 
might contribute. Social divisions can permeate interactions 
amongst  individuals  even  in  the  absence  of  significant 
ethnic, racial or other factors of segregation. Fresh divisions 
constantly emerge and become entrenched; patterns of social 
inclusion  and  exclusion  preserve  benefits  for  specific  social 
segments based on physical location, shared interests, historic 
inequalities or other criteria.

If  the  four  dimensions  of  the  inclusive  city  –  social,  political, 
economic and cultural – are to be turned from a mere conceptual 
paradigm into reality, they must be implemented within a rights-
based framework, and one that is easy to enforce. Short of this, 
prevailing patterns of exclusionary development, selective benefit-
sharing,  marginalization  and  discrimination  will  continue 
unabated in cities. City efforts to design and implement strategies 
for inclusiveness must be based on a clear and cogent representation 
of the way these four dimensions can be integrated concurrently 
into the day-to-day lives of the population.

Only  through  explicit  and  deliberately  inclusive  processes  will 
it be possible to identify the locally appropriate, innovative and 
high-leverage  actions  and  policies  which  government,  public 
officials and major institutions can deploy to set in motion self-
reinforcing processes that will bridge the urban divide.

Income Inequality in Cities: Contrasting Numbers  

In general terms, income inequalities in developed countries 
are low. However, altogether, income inequalities in developed 
countries  increased  between  the  mid-1980s  and  2005. 
Little is known about inequalities in European urban areas 
specifically, as available data is generally not disaggregated to 
individual cities. Still, nationwide aggregates do not always 
accurately reflect disparities in general urban or city-specific 
incomes.  The  most  surprising  variations  between  national 
and city-specific Gini coefficients of income or consumption 
disparities are found in the United States of America, where 
around  2005  the  national  coefficient  stood  at  0.38,  but 
exceeded  0.5  in  many  major  metropolitan  areas  including 
Washington, D.C.; New York City; Miami; and others. These 
values are comparable to the average Gini coefficients of cities 
in selected Latin American countries, where income inequality 
is particularly steep.

Income inequalities are higher in the developing world than 
in developed nations. New data presented by UN-HABITAT 
on Gini coefficients shows mixed results in the various regions 
of the South. 

In  general,  urban  inequality  in  Latin  America  and  the 
Caribbean  is  declining,  although  it  remains  quite  high. 
An  analysis  of  income  distribution  trends  in  17  selected 
countries  in  the  region  shows  that  in  nine  of  them,  urban 
Gini coefficients have fallen slightly between the late 1990s 
and  2006.  However,  in  the  urban  areas  of  five  other  Latin

American  countries,  income  inequalities  have  slightly  risen 
or  remained  stable.  The  recent  improvement  in  economic 
conditions in various countries across the region has resulted 
in a narrower income gap between rich and poor. However, 
the current financial and food crises are likely to dampen the 
chances for sustained economic growth in coming years, and 
short of appropriate pro-poor policies, inequalities may rise 
again, instead of declining further. 

Trends in the economic divide in Africa’s urban areas are 
mixed. Among the 13 countries under review, eight showed 
lower values (if only marginally for some) and five featured 
moderate to significant increases. The region’s urban areas, in 
sub-Saharan  Africa  in  particular,  retain  the  highest  degrees 
of poverty in the world, together with the highest prevalence 
of slum populations in urban areas. In African urban areas, 
progress  in  poverty  reduction  has  been  rather  slow  overall, 
but  these  mixed  results  in  the  distribution  of  income  and 
consumption point to the hope of future improvements. 

In Asia, the economic urban divide is widening. Although 
income  and  consumption  inequality  is  low  to  moderate 
overall,  average  incomes  have  increased  in  almost  all  Asian 
countries,  and  poverty  has  fallen  nearly  everywhere  in  the 
region, with the exception of Bangladesh.

African cities appear to be the most unequal in the world 
(sample of 37 cities with an average Gini coefficient of 0.58). 
Next  come  Latin  American  cities  (24  cities,  with  a  Gini 
average  of  0.52).  Asian  cities  (30)  feature  a  comparatively 
low  degree  of  income  inequality,  as  measured  by  a  Gini 
coefficient of 0.384. Eastern Europe (8) and CIS cities (10) 
feature the lowest average Gini values and, presumably, the 
greatest degrees of equality, at 0.298 and 0.322, respectively.

Highly unequal income or consumption patterns in cities in the 
developing world point to institutional and structural failures, 
as  well  as  to  broader  economic  problems  such  as  imbalanced 
labour markets or a lack of pro-poor policies. The more unequal 
the distribution of income or consumption in urban areas, the 
higher the risk that economic disparities will result in social and 
political tension. 
 
Space Inequality: The Poverty Trap 

The spatial divide in developing country cities does not just 
reflect income inequalities among households; it is also a by-
product of inefficient land and housing markets, ineffective 
financial  mechanisms  and  poor  urban  planning.  While 
income  inequalities  are  a  major  divisive  social  factor,  the 
spatial inequalities visible in so many cities are an outgrowth of 
both socioeconomic disparities and larger processes of urban 
development,  governance  and  institutionalized  exclusion  of 
specific groups. 

When slum areas are physically isolated and disconnected 
from the main urban fabric, residents become cut off from 
the city, often enduring longer commuting times and higher 
transportation costs than they would if their neighbourhoods 

were  more  integrated  into  urban  networks.  On  top  of  low 
incomes  and  shelter  deprivations,  these  residents  find 
themselves  underprivileged  in  terms  of  access  to  the  urban 
advantage.  Combined,  the  physical  and  social  distance 
between  poor  and  rich  neighbourhoods  represents  a  spatial 
poverty trap marked by six distinct challenges: (a) severe job 
restrictions; (b) high rates of gender disparities; (c) deteriorated 
living conditions; (d) social exclusion and marginalization; (e) 
lack  of  social  interaction,  and  (f)  high  incidence  of  crime.  

Absence of policy coordination between or within national and 
local government constrains cities’ ability to meet the requirements 
of  urban  development  and  to  deploy  strategies  that  mitigate 
spatial inequality.

More  gender-specific  schemes,  like  maternity  and  childcare 
benefits,  vocational  training,  protecting  women’s  rights  at  the 
workplace,  and  micro-credit  are  required  if  women  are  to  be 
lifted out of the spatial poverty trap.

Inequality of Opportunities 

In every country in the world, access to the “urban advantage” 
and distribution of the related benefits is largely determined by 
various organizations and institutions – including, crucially, 
the formal land and labour markets as well as public utilities. 
The  problem  in  developing  countries  is  that  most  of  these 
institutions  are  weak  or  dysfunctional,  exposing  them  to 
undue  influence  from,  or  capture  by,  vested  domestic  or 
foreign interests. In some cities, necessary public institutions 
are lacking altogether, in which case essentially private vested 
interests  fill  the  void  and  act  as  substitutes  for  institutions 
that  would  otherwise  prioritize  the  interests  of  society  at 
large. In both situations, the markets for land, basic services 
and labour are skewed in favour of private interests, enabling 
them to claim more than their fair shares of the benefits of 
the “urban advantage”. In this process, uneducated people and 
young slum dwellers, particularly women, are deprived of the 
formal, secure livelihoods that could lift them up and out of 
the dire socioeconomic outcomes associated with the informal, 
insecure conditions in which they are forced to live.

As  reflected  in  the  limited  resources  available  for  good 
schooling, health and other facilities in many cities, unequal 
opportunities  create  “minorities  in  the  marketplace”  whose 
individual members are automatically excluded from a wide 
range  of  outcomes  associated  with  economic  growth  and 
globalization  –  including  demand  for  a  skilled  and  healthy 
labour force.

The particular ways cities are planned, designed and built says 
much  about  what  is  valued  there,  and  planning  processes  can 
either help or hinder development of opportunities for all. Basic 
services make a significant contribution to the “urban advantage”, 
and together with employment feature high among the aspirations 
of  those  who  move  to  cities  in  search  of  a  brighter  future.

Today, about 85 per cent of all new employment opportunities 
around the world occur in the informal economy and young 
people in slums are more likely to work in the informal sector 
than their non-slum peers. Despite some advantages, informal 
employment ends up trapping slum-dwelling and other low-
income  young  people  in  perpetual  poverty.  Unfortunately, 
slum  areas  remain  a  “blind  spot”  when  it  comes  to  policy 
interventions, job creation and youth support.

So far, the benefits of the “urban advantage” keep eluding 
some  specific  groups,  and  women  in  particular.  Poverty 
consistently exposes young urban females to steeper challenges 
than male peers when it comes to acquiring the knowledge 
and skills they need to live healthy, fulfilling lives. 

Local  authorities  should  adjust  laws  and  regulations  to  lower 
the costs and increase the benefits for those willing to formalize 
their businesses. Local authorities should also provide assistance 
to small enterprises, enabling them to upgrade skills and improve 
access to both productive resources and market opportunities.

infrastructure 

labour-intensive 

Large-scale, 
and  urban 
improvement  works  could  provide  gainful  employment  to  the 
poor as well as their fair share in the “urban advantage”. These 
labour-intensive programmes are to be combined with vocational 
training and skill development activities. 

The Social Divide 

The economic divide does more than deprive the poor of 
the proper shelter, basic utilities and dignified employment 
that are typically associated with the “urban advantage” and 
to  which  they  are  entitled.  Beyond  the  functional  goods 
and  services  that  provide  for  decent  living  conditions,  the 
repercussions of poverty can reach into life in its most physical 
and social dimensions. 

Based on a systematic comparison of slum with non-slum 
populations within the same city, and groups of slum dwellers 
suffering  various  types  of  shelter  deprivations,  this  Report 
demonstrates with compelling evidence that hunger, health 
and poor education outcomes have strong social class gradients, 
as measured by the intensity of shelter deprivations.

Hunger  in  cities. More and more urban populations are 
experiencing hunger and often with more intensity than those 
in  rural  areas.  New  data  presented  by  UN-HABITAT  on 
malnutrition in urban areas – as measured by the incidence 
of  underweight  children  –  shows  significant  differences  in 
food  security  across  socioeconomic  groups  in  cities.  As  the 
relentless  rise  in  food  prices  in  urban  areas  combines  with 
persistently  low  incomes,  the  urban  poor  cannot  afford  to 
purchase adequate amounts and types of food. Paradoxically, 
even  in  those  countries  with  enough  food  for  the  whole 
population, only the richest can access it, while the poorest 
struggle  every  day  to  ensure  one  meal  for  their  offspring. 

Based on strong empirical evidence, this Report shows that 
the  current  food  crisis  is  not  the  first  of  its  kind.  In  many 
places,  food  insecurity  has  affected  the  daily  lives  of  urban 
poor and rural families for at least the past two decades. Data 
reveals that in the developing world, serious malnutrition has 
been widespread in urban slums and rural areas since 1990, 
regardless of local food crises. Over the past 15 years, more than 
four out of 10 children suffered from stunted development in 
Asia and Africa; in the poorest nations of Latin America and 
the  Caribbean,  the  proportion  was  three  to  five  out  of  10. 
Just like poverty, hunger in cities is only the outcome of an 
inequitable distribution of available resources. Children from 
poor families are often born into hunger, grow up in hunger, 
and  might  die  in  hunger  if  no  remedial  action  is  taken. 

The structural food crises the urban poor keep experiencing on 
an ongoing basis call for fundamental policy remedies, including 
with  regard  to  production,  marketing,  distribution,  handling, 
and control of food for the urban market.

Slum  upgrading  is  strongly  linked  to  health  and  nutrition 
programmes, and altogether should be part of a comprehensive 
approach to improved lives for the urban poor. 

Eradicating  hunger  will  require  multiple  interventions,  and 
not  only  those  related  to  food  availability.  Use  of  safe  water, 
improved sanitation and durable housing materials, combined 
with provision of sufficient living areas to ease overcrowding, will 
improve the chances of better health outcomes and life conditions 
for slum dwellers.

The health divide. The poor are typically driven to the least 
developed areas of a city, often places that are poorly integrated 
to the urban fabric, where dilapidated environments lead to 
worse health outcomes and greater risks of premature deaths 
than  in  improved  and  well-maintained  urban  areas.  This 
Report  argues  that  cities  where  a  higher  degree  of  equality 
prevails – including lower income disparities, lower incidence 
of  slums  and  only  small  numbers  of  slum  dwellers  with 
various  shelter  deprivations  –  the  occurrence  of  ill  health 
tends to be noticeably less frequent. Conversely, public health 
is generally poorer in more unequal cities that feature stark 
material  differences  in  housing  and  basic  service  provision. 
Better housing conditions are therefore essential to ensuring 
a  healthy  population.  For  instance,  in  cities  featuring  large 
numbers of households with all four basic shelter deprivations, 
the  prevalence  of  diseases  such  as  diarrhea  rises  twofold 
compared with the whole city, and about threefold or more 
when compared with the non-slum areas of the same city. 

Moreover,  child  mortality  rates  remain  highly  associated 
with  diarrhoeal  diseases,  malaria  and  acute  respiratory 
infections related to overcrowding and air pollution; these in 
turn result from various environmental health hazards such as 
lack of sanitation and hygiene, lack of access to safe water, poor 
housing conditions, poor management of solid wastes, and

many  other  hazardous  conditions.  Children  in  substandard 
environments are exposed to contaminated air, food, water and 
soil, and to conditions where parasite-carrying insects breed. 

The  fight  against  childhood  diseases  must  look  beyond  the 
traditional  realm  of  the  household  to  encompass  the  modern 
environment  of  disease:  the  neighbourhood,  and  the  city  as  a 
whole, with all their attendant risks and harms.

Education:  Opportunities  and  inequalities.  Access  to 
education  is  greater  in  cities  than  in  rural  areas.  In  most 
countries of the South, the “urban advantage” is quite clear 
for  both  rich  and  poor  in  urban  settings.  However,  not  all 
cities  are  alike  in  their  accommodation  of  young  people’s 
education and employment needs. Social and cultural barriers 
continue to deny slum dwellers the opportunity to complete 
their basic education. Children from slum communities are 
less likely to enroll in school and complete primary education; 
and youth living in the same communities have noticeably 
fewer opportunities to attend secondary school if compared 
with their peers in non-slum areas. These initial inequalities 
intensify  at  higher  levels  of  education,  perpetuating  and 
reproducing an unfair system that restricts the physical and 
intellectual  potential  of  millions  of  young  urban  dwellers, 
whose  future  is  denied  or  jeopardized  for  lack  of  equitable 
distribution policies. The dilemma for many children of poor 
families is not what to study in the future, but a simple and 
shocking one: food, or school. Education remains a luxury for 
the urban poor in the face of current crises. 

This Report sheds light on the particular challenges faced 
by slum populations with regard to this fundamental right, 
highlighting the fact that if the urban/rural gap in education 
has  been  reduced  over  time,  the  divide  between  rich  and 
poor populations has been widening, and is cause for great 
concern.  The  Report  also  shows  with  fresh  data  that  social 
inequalities are not only a matter of class hierarchy, but also 
of gender disparities. Still, efforts to improve the education of 
girls in some countries have resulted in significant increases 
in their enrolment numbers, but today a slight regression in 
boys’  enrolment  and  participation  is  becoming  a  worrying 
trend that calls for gender-sensitive responses. 

The education of girls and young women generates powerful 
poverty-reducing synergies and yields enormous intergenerational 
gains.  It  is  positively  correlated  with  enhanced  economic 
productivity, more robust labour markets, higher earnings, and 
improved societal health and well-being.

 

Bridging The Urban Divide

Taking Forward the Right to the City 

The “right to the city” has evolved over the past 50 years 
as  a  challenge  to  the  exclusionary  development,  selective 
benefit-sharing, marginalization and discrimination that are 
rampant in cities today. More than a new legalistic device, 
the right to the city is the expression of the deep yearnings 
of  urban  dwellers  for  effective  recognition  of  their  various 
human  rights.  The  concept  has  been  deployed  in  various 
ways  across  regions,  countries  and  cities  of  the  world.  In 
some  places  it  has  been  used  as  a  theoretical  and  political 
framework 
focusing  on  enforcement,  empowerment, 
participation, self-fulfillment, self-determination and various 
forms of human rights protection at the city level. In other 
places, the concept has served as a platform for action and a 
practical framework for enforcement, whereas in some cities, 
the concept is absent from the political discourse, either not 
used at all or banned outright.

Where the right to the city has been implemented, higher 
degrees  of  inclusion  have  not  necessarily  ensued,  though. 
Large  numbers  of  people,  particularly  in  the  developing 
world, do not fully benefit from the “urban advantage”, do 
not participate in decision-making and do not enjoy effective 
fundamental  rights  and  liberties,  while  others  do,  living  in 
decent,  healthy  and  environmentally  friendly  places  with 
full exercise of their citizenship. Some other countries have 
made significant efforts to close the urban divide as part of 
a  less  specific  “rights-based”  approach,  or  only  recognizing 
some particular aspects of the right to the city. Despite these 
ambiguities, the right to the city remains a powerful vehicle 
for social change.

Brazil  in  1988  was  the  first  country  to  include  the  right 
to the city in its constitution. As an expert from São Paulo 
commented  in  the  UN-HABITAT  policy  analysis  on  the 
inclusive  city,  “nowadays,  talking  about  rights  is  talking 
about  the  right  to  the  city”.  Ecuador  recognized  several 
housing-related rights in its 2008 constitution, including the 
right to the city. In that country, a respondent to the survey 
component of the policy analysis in Portoviejo associated this 
right with unrestricted access to services, freedom of opinion 
and  participation,  and  equal  access  to  opportunities:  “This 
right is, in its broader sense, endorsed by decision-makers, as 
well as recognized and implemented by the community in its 
everyday life through widespread practice.”

Many  other  cities 

in  the  developing  world  devise 
and  deploy  policies  in  compliance  with  national  legal 
commitments to more inclusive communities; although they 
fall  short  of  explicit  references  to  the  right  to  the  city  per 
se,  they  endorse  some  particular  aspects  of  the  notion.  For 
example, Rosario, Argentina’s third largest city, has declared 
itself a “Human Rights City” with a formal commitment to 
openness, transparency and accountability. In Australia, the

Victoria Charter of Human Rights and Responsibilities (2006) 
refers  explicitly  to  equal  rights,  including  freedom,  respect, 
equality and dignity for all. Some other countries and cities 
endorse aspects of democratic governance that are explicitly 
or implicitly consistent with the “right to the city” concept: 
Dakar’s Civic and Citizens’ Pact (2003); India’s Citizen’s Charter 
(1997); and Porto Alegre’s Participatory Budgeting and Local 
Solidarity and Governance Programme (2004). 

A number of cities in India, Ghana, South Africa, Colombia, 
Brazil,  Ecuador,  Peru  and  other  Latin  American  countries 
are  also  taking  forward  the  right  to  the  city  concept  in  a 
variety of spheres (social, economic, political, and cultural), 
even  if  progress  is  often  rather  slow  and  sometimes  suffers 
from repeated setbacks. In some other cities and countries, 
particularly  in  South-Eastern  and  Eastern  Asia  and  North 
Africa,  economic  growth  policies  have  gone  hand  in  hand 
with positive social developments and the populations enjoy 
a decent quality of life, but political rights and freedom are 
lagging  behind.  Other  cities  and  countries,  mainly  in  sub-
Saharan Africa and Western Asia, are about to deploy legal 
and political frameworks based on equality and rights.

This Report identifies the factors hindering implementation 
of the right to the city and other forms of inclusion needed 
to bridge the urban divide. In addition to a variety of factors 
–  historical  socioeconomic  inequalities,  grinding  poverty, 
environmental  degradation  and  more  frequent  climate 
change-related  natural  disasters,  among  other  threats  –  the 
Report highlights poorly defined inclusive mechanisms and 
institutions. It also points to deficiencies in the instruments 
that make it possible to understand and anticipate some of 
the  factors  generating  further  inequalities  (i.e.,  scarcity  of 
land and concentration of ownership in very few hands; lack 
of  redistributive  policies;  ineffective  housing  markets,  etc.). 
Moreover, only very few municipal leaders have demonstrated 
a proper sense of vision or political commitment to overcome 
the urban divide. 

UN-HABITAT policy analysis shows that more often than 
not, policy aims and processes do not match because they fail 
to acknowledge the inter-linkages among the four spheres or 
dimensions of the inclusive city – economic, social, political, 
and  cultural.  Admittedly,  cities  will,  time  and  again,  adopt 
new rules and regulations in a bid to address some exclusion-
related  issues;  but  these  fail  to  spell  out  specific  goalposts, 
sustained processes or tangible results that can be monitored. 
Moreover, institutional frameworks tend over time to embed 
negative instead of positive attitudes, and to entrench informal 
social arrangements that are impervious to change. The Report 
details  the  most  important  factors  that  prevent  cities  from 
bridging the urban divide and taking forward the right to the 
city. These include (1) poor coordination among various tiers 
of government; (2) absence of data for informed policy choices; 
(3)  influence  of  vested  interests;  (4)  inadequate  adjustment 
to  changing  economic  conditions;  and  (5)  exclusion  of 
marginalized groups and discrimination of minorities. 

Against  this  background,  it  is  not  surprising  that  more 
than two-thirds of respondents to the UN-HABITAT policy 
analysis survey perceived urban reforms as serving primarily 
the  interests  of  the  rich,  with  politicians  and  civil  servants 
coming next (except in Africa, where they are viewed as the 
major  beneficiaries).  The  urban  poor  stand  to  share  only 
to a minimal extent, if at all, in any benefits accruing from 
urbanization and related reforms. As one of the experts from 
Latin  America  commented,  “When  one  is  [economically] 
poor, one is also poor and excluded in a cultural, social and 
political sense”. The majority of excluded groups in slum areas 
typically fall victim to a sort of triple jeopardy: (1) they are 
poor and uneducated; (2) many are migrants or from ethnic 
minorities; and (3) many are female.

This  Report  identifies  the  key  principles  underlying  the 
right to the city, providing the basic underpinnings needed 
by those municipalities interested in a rights-based approach 
to inclusion that does not overtly endorse the “right to the 
city” concept. The Report also discusses some critical aspects 
that  are  needed  to  guarantee  an  effective  right  to  the  city 
for all. In particular, this right must be seen as a vision for 
an alternative, well-devised, ideal city; instead of a right to 
any  city,  especially  today’s  dominant,  defective  model,  this 
is  an  entitlement  to  an  urban  environment  where  mutual 
respect,  tolerance,  democracy  and  social  justice  prevail. 

Adoption and implementation of a strong human rights-based 
approach upholds the dignity of all urban residents in the face 
of multiple rights violations, including the right to decent living 
conditions. The right to the city can provide municipal authorities 
with  the  platform  they  need  for  a  wide  range  of  policies  and 
initiatives that promote an “inclusive” urban environment.

The right to the city calls for a holistic, balanced and multicultural 
type of urban development. Therefore, it must pervade all policy 
areas, including land use, planning, management and reform, 
and it must do so in close cooperation with government agencies 
and civil society. 

The Regional Dynamics of Inclusion 

The urban divide results from social, economic, political, 
and cultural exclusion. Taken individually, each of these di-
mensions has far-reaching consequences for urban dynamics 
and the way policy initiatives can influence inequality. How-
ever, this Report shows with compelling evidence that these 
four dimensions overlap and interact to a substantial degree. 
Therefore, understanding the dynamic linkages among them 
is essential to any prompt and sustainable transition from a 
partially to a completely inclusive city. Any government com-
mitted to promoting inclusiveness should act in a proactive 
way across the four dimensions. UN-HABITAT policy analy-
sis highlights significant associations among them, and these

findings can be readily used by municipal and other public 
authorities to guide their own efforts and policies on the way 
to more inclusive cities.

Africa’s national, local and municipal authorities must improve 
coordination of their planning and implementation functions if 
the urban divide is to be narrowed across the continent. 

Economic inclusion is tied closely to the social and political 
dimensions of inclusion. Some cities grow and prosper, others 
are less successful. In any of these cases, genuine economic 
inclusion leading to equitable allocation of opportunities and 
income is, to a very large extent, determined by the political, 
cultural and social equality parameters that are specific to any 
given city. 

UN-HABITAT  analysis  shows  that  in  African  surveyed 
cities, economic inclusion appears to be strongly associated 
with the planning functions of municipal, state/provincial and 
national government, as well as with the active involvement 
of  non-governmental  organizations  that  advocate  stronger 
political will, freedom of expression and human rights. The 
connection  between  economic  inclusion  and  social  and 
political  freedoms  comes  as  a  response  to  extensive  rent-
seeking by the political and economic elites that dominate the 
urban economy. For all purposes and effects, this correlation 
echoes  a  call  to  democratize  the  business  sector  in  order 
to  open  it  up  and  provide  opportunities  for  all,  instead  of 
systematically  denying  these  to  most  citizens  due  to  weak 
institutions,  inadequate  regulatory  frameworks,  and  poor 
government management of the economic sphere. 

In  Asia,  economic  inclusiveness  in  surveyed  cities  is 
associated  with  government-induced  employment  (through 
infrastructure  development,  for  example),  together  with 
fiscal incentives and sound contractual and legal frameworks. 
Freedom  of  expression  is  also  strongly  associated  with 
economic inclusiveness in this region. This can be explained 
by the expansion of the middle class as a result of economic 
prosperity in various countries, which in turn is accompanied 
by greater demands not just for the sake of improved social 
and  economic  conditions,  but  also  for  transparency  and 
accountability. 

In  Latin  American  and  Caribbean  cities  under  review, 
multiparty  democracy  and  freedom  of  the  press  are  both 
strongly  associated  with  economic  inclusiveness.  Despite 
significant  progress 
in  democratic  governance,  expert 
opinion  suggests  that  political  institutions,  rule  of  law  and 
accountability in this region do not always work properly and 
still fall short of the expectations of urban populations. This 
political  call  to  amend  dysfunctional  social  and  economic 
institutions is echoed in survey respondents’ perceptions that 
urban policies, reforms and decisions benefit the rich by up to 
three times as much as they do slum dwellers and the poor.

Reform of government institutions, combined with modernized 
public policies and novel forms of participation, are of crucial 
importance if economic inclusion of the poor is to be improved.

Social 

inclusiveness  calls 

for  a  multidimensional 
approach. Once again, findings show that coordination at all 
levels of government is critical to bridging the social divide. 
Interestingly,  among  all  policy  interventions,  government 
health care programmes appear to be the most effective bridge 
over the social divide; in Africa, public transport features as 
the second most effective way of reducing social inequalities. 
In  the  Asian  cities  under  review,  UN-HABITAT  analysis 
shows  that  improvements  in  social  inclusiveness  are  closely 
associated  with  the  political  role  of  non-governmental 
organizations  advocating  stronger  political  commitment 
by  government,  along  with  freedom  of  expression  and 
other  human  rights.  This  strong  link  suggests  that  these 
organizations  should  play  an  even  more  proactive  role  in 
the political sphere; they could, for instance, encourage the 
citizenry to regroup and put public authorities under more 
pressure, as is already the case in Latin American cities. Civil 
society must also explore new frontiers if it is effectively to 
support the institutional strengthening required to promote 
equality, political rights and civil liberties.

In  Latin  American  and  Caribbean  cities  under  review, 
social  inclusion  is  associated  with  several  policy  variables, 
particularly in three areas: change in existing rules to promote 
employment,  improvements  in  political  governance,  and 
freedom of cultural expression. The experts participating in 
the UN-HABITAT policy analysis were of the view that an 
enabling,  efficient  legal  framework  would  stimulate  formal 
job creation and therefore it is an essential pre-requisite for 
social and economic inclusion. Experts also considered that 
institutions  and  enforcement  mechanisms  would  enable 
communities  to  raise  their  voices  in  order  to  ensure  that 
their  demands  are  heard  and  mainstreamed  both  in  legal 
frameworks  and  policy  decisions.  Finally,  in  some  cities 
culture is promoted as a means of social inclusion. In Bogotá, 
for instance, culture builds collective identity and conviviality 
as  an  antidote  to  violence,  illustrating  its  potential  role  in 
social transformation.

A healthy, well-educated population is a major asset for any city, 
and knowledge is a prerequisite for enhanced civic participation 
in the social, political and cultural spheres. 

Where cities fail to deploy institutions and procedures that are 
more  responsive  to  the  needs  of  ordinary  people  (including  the 
poor), exclusion and social inequality will continue to interfere 
with effective basic rights and liberties for everyone, a phenomenon 
that can pose threats to social and political stability.

Political  inclusiveness  and  democratic  governance. 
It comes as no surprise that freedom of expression and the 
press,  multiparty  elections  and  a  constitutional  guarantee 
of cultural expression were all found to be positively linked 
to political inclusiveness in the African cities under review – 
even though these components of democratic politics are at 
different stages of advancement across countries, and making 
relatively  slow  progress  overall.  The  statement  of  an  expert 
respondent  to  the  policy  analysis  in  Abuja  that  “the  city  is 
dominated by the politics of the rich and godfatherism”, seems 
to echo a general sentiment in various other African cities. 
However,  some  aspects  of  democracy  (e.g.,  proper  election 
standards,  viability  of  basic  democratic  institutions,  courts 
and legislatures) and social participation are becoming more 
dominant in the political discourse in the region. In Ghana, 
Liberia,  Rwanda  and  South  Africa,  public  administrations 
have been more responsive. 

In  Latin  America  and  the  Caribbean,  too,  freedom  of 
expression and the press is, naturally enough, associated with 
political inclusion, as are multiparty elections. In this region, 
the factors behind inequalities remain as challenging as ever, 
and an expert in Bogotá noted that “poverty and exclusion act 
as restricting factors for some groups, so that civil and political 
freedoms for them often end up being more symbolic than 
effective”. Although social participation is recognized as a civic 
right, and good practice in this respect is not absent across the 
continent, experts rated it very low. Still, in general terms, the 
political process is looking very encouraging in a number of 
cities and countries in this region, as it is beginning to usher 
in  a  more  positive  political  and  institutional  environment. 
Various instances of best practice demonstrate the close links 
between  political  inclusiveness,  democratic  governance  and 
full exercise of civic and political rights. Other instances show 
a clear connection between cultural expression and political 
inclusion (e.g., Bogotá’s Declaration of Cultural Rights). 

The  empirical  link  between  democratic  governance  and  social 
inclusion  highlights  the  need  for  institutions  and  enforcement 
mechanisms  that  favour  participatory  decision-making,  while 
guaranteeing effective freedom of speech and the press.

Using  culture 

for  social,  economic  and  political 
inclusion. In cities as diverse as Buenos Aires, Port-au-Prince, 
Chittagong,  Abuja  or  Mombasa,  cultural  diversity  and  city 
inclusion  find  themselves  challenged  by  a  similar  set  of 
factors,  namely,  extremely  inequitable  provision  of  cultural 
facilities and access to culture, technology and information 
among poorer areas and more affluent neighbourhoods. This 
cultural divide undermines the capacity of the poor to take 
advantage of modern-day cultural and other opportunities for 
self-development and enjoyment. 

Numerous  cities  are,  nevertheless,  struggling  to  promote 
culture in underprivileged areas and enabling some forms of 
cultural rights and expressions; they do so through three main 
channels:  (1)  ad  hoc  provision  of  shared  spaces  for  cultural 

events; (2) promotion of intercultural programmes; and (3) 
the  protection  and  celebration  of  specific  monuments  and 
buildings that are part of the architectural heritage. In most 
such  cases,  though,  the  rationale  behind  the  promotion  of 
cultural expression and heritage preservation is to impose fixed 
values and single, one-way meanings on places and narratives, 
which are made to reflect only the history of the country’s or 
city’s ethnic majority and oligarchies. Consequently, various 
other cultural and ethnic groups fail to recognize themselves 
in that particular history or local identity, adding to their sense 
of systematic exclusion.  In all developing regions, the poor 
and slum dwellers appear to be systematically excluded from 
cultural life, along with the elderly, young people and foreign 
migrants. Poverty in Asia, Africa and Latin America conspires 
against cultural inclusion. An expert in Quito characterized 
this relationship in no uncertain terms: “An individual who 
is  poor  economically  will  very  often  be  poor  socially  and 
culturally,  too”.  In  Asian  and  African  cities,  where  culture 
is  historically  entrenched  in  various  forms  of  inequalities 
that  persist  across  generations,  freedom  of  expression 
appears to be strongly linked with cultural inclusion. In the 
Latin  American  and  Caribbean  cities  under  review,  cultural 
inclusiveness is positively correlated with laws that promote 
equitable employment, as well as with fiscal incentives, micro-
credit  and  formal  municipal  promotion  of  culture.  Cities 
and countries that are bridging the cultural divide combine 
effective access to education, the judiciary and other public 
and private services, as well as sports and leisure activities and 
amenities, recognizing that cultural diversity is essential to the 
construction of citizenship. This recognition is fundamental 
if  traditional  behaviour,  attitudes  and  practice  are  to  be 
transformed  for  the  purposes  of  an  enhanced  democratic 
culture. 

Cities  should  encourage  anything  that  can  foster  multiple  and 
complementary  identities  in  order  to  reduce  any  polarization 
between various groups, particularly in a multi-cultural, multi-
linguistic,  multi-ethnic  type  of  society.  Recognition  of  cultural 
diversity  entails  the  deployment  of  spaces  and  conditions  that 
favour various forms of active participation, in accordance with 
the  different  societal,  cultural  and  organizational  forms  that 
characterize any given population. 

Five Strategic Steps to an Inclusive City 

An inclusive city can be defined and individually experienced 
in many different ways by its residents. Still, inclusive cities 
share  a  few  basic  features  that  can  take  different  forms  in 
various  conditions:  they  provide  the  opportunities  and 
supportive  mechanisms  that  enable  all  residents  to  develop 
their  full  potential  and  gain  their  fair  shares  of  the  “urban 
advantage”. In an inclusive city, residents perceive themselves 
as important contributors to decision-making, ranging from 
political  issues  to  the  more  mundane  routines  of  daily  life. 
Active  participation  guarantees  all  residents  a  stake  in  the

benefits  of  urban  development.  The  concepts  of  human 
relations, citizenship and civic rights are all inseparable from 
urban inclusiveness.

UN-HABITAT  policy  analysis  has  identified  a  series  of 
practical strategic steps and catalysts for change that make it 
easier for municipal authorities to bridge the urban divide. 
The practical strategic steps that contribute to the promotion 
of an inclusive city are the following: (1) assessing the past 
and measuring progress; (2) establishing new, more effective 
institutions,  or  strengthening  existing  ones  as  needed;  (3) 
building  new  linkages  and  alliances  among  various  tiers  of 
government;  (4)  developing  a  sustained,  comprehensive 
vision to promote inclusiveness; and (5) ensuring an equitable 
redistribution of opportunities. 

1) Assessing the past and measuring progress. The beauty and 
the challenge of urban space is that no two cities are alike. 
Each has its own history, economy, politics, social dynamics, 
cultural  beat  and,  above  all,  human  potential.  Cities  do 
not become divisive overnight; rather, as this report shows, 
exclusion and marginalization build and reproduce over time 
due to fierce and unequal competition for land, labour, capital, 
resources,  and  the  like.  Understanding  the  specific  factors 
behind the urban divide and the way it makes itself felt in 
any given city is a crucial step for those municipal authorities 
committed to promoting inclusion. Such understanding can 
help  determine  the  direction  of  change  and  anticipate  the 
institutional  and  financial  requirements  for  reform.  It  also 
establishes  a  starting  point  from  which  future  policies  and 
practices can be assessed, enabling city managers to monitor 
progress and evaluate performance. 

2)  More  effective,  stronger  institutions.  In  the  cities  of  the 
developing world, existing rules and institutions are generally 
perceived as creations of the rich and powerful that frequently 
cater  to  their  sole  interests,  with  little  regard  for  those  of 
other  social  groups,  particularly  the  poor.  However,  a  new 
development  paradigm  is  placing  institutions  at  the  centre 
of  efforts  to  promote  sustainable  development  and  reduce 
poverty and inequality, recognizing their moral leverage and 
power  of  social  transformation.  Evidence  from  successful 
cities shows that the way municipalities perform their duties is 
just as important as the nature of what they achieve. Inclusive 
cities conduct in-depth reviews of their systems, structures and 
institutional mechanisms to pave the way for genuine change, 
including the more effective and stronger institutions that are 
part of a structural and societal transformation process. 

3)  Building  new  linkages  and  alliances  among  the  various 
tiers  of  government.  Evidence  from  the  UN-HABITAT 
expert survey shows that it takes no less than the three tiers 
of government (city, state/provincial and national) to make 
a city inclusive, and even a fourth one – metropolitan-area 
coordinating  bodies  –  depending  on  local  circumstances. 
Unfortunately,  in  the  developing  world,  reality  is  all-too-
often at odds with this finding, as government coordination 
remains patchy, poor and informal. Cities that manage both 
to  develop  innovative  programmes  and  actions  and  deploy 

greater  “entrepreneurship”  achieve  more  if  they  establish 
strategic  alliances  that  combine  policies  and  resources 
with other tiers of government as well as the private sector. 
Efficient linkages among various public authorities and civil 
society also ensure greater sustainability of local programmes.  
Experience shows that at the root of successful collaboration 
lies an institutional and managerial capacity to share resources 
such as staff, skills, funding, information and knowledge for 
mutual benefit or gain. 

4) Demonstrating a sustained vision to promote inclusiveness. 
Cities need a clear “vision” of their future – a long-term plan 
that  combines  creativity,  realism  and  inspiration  on  top  of 
providing a framework for strategic planning. A city’s “vision” 
builds  upon  its  specific  identity,  comparative  advantage, 
geographic endowments and defining historical and cultural 
dimensions. It is not just a city’s function, structure and form 
that its vision projects into the future, but also a community’s 
dreams and aspirations. For this reason, any city “vision” should 
always be context-driven and developed with the participation 
of all segments of the population. Unfortunately, at present, 
in a majority of cities, urban planning practice seems to be 
divorced  from  any  long-term  city  vision,  and  many  major 
decisions are influenced by pressures from various stakeholders. 
Thus,  an  open,  transparent  process  that  integrates  various 
kinds  of  urban  stakeholders  has  more  chances  to  address 
entrenched problems of exclusion, proposing solutions that 
are appropriate both culturally and politically. Such inclusive 
development of a vision and planning in turn enhances the 
potential for collective ownership, as the proposed action plan 
is  endorsed  by  the  broadest  possible  constituency.  A  city’s 
vision  must  be  optimistic  and  ambitious,  and  at  the  same 
time realistic. It should be innovative if it is to break with the 
inertia of the past and bring about a qualitative leap towards 
the future. A vision should turn into a workable plan with 
clearly defined funding sources and accounting mechanisms. 
In this sense, far from being a fiction, a “vision” is a plan, a 
roadmap, and a commitment that is made by city authorities 
(who are the leaders, custodians and promoters of the vision) 
and the other tiers of government and civil society (who are 
major stakeholders in the process).

5)  Ensuring  the  redistribution  of  opportunities.  Cities  are 
places  of  opportunity.  They  act  as  the  engines  of  national 
economies, driving wealth creation, social development and 
employment.  The  urban  environment  acts  as  the  primary 
locus  for  innovation,  industrial  and  technological  progress, 
entrepreneurship  and  creativity.  Strong  empirical  evidence 
confirms  that  the  concentration  of  people  and  productive 
activities in cities generates economies of scale and proxim-
ity that stimulate growth and reduce the costs of production, 
including the delivery of collective basic services such as piped 
water,  sewers  and  drains,  electricity,  solid  waste  collection, 
public transport, health care, schools and many other pub-
lic amenities and services. However, as it concentrates people 
and productive activities, a city can become a problem if it 
is inadequately planned or poorly governed, or when distri-

butional  policies  are  lacking  or  dysfunctional.  The  distribu-
tion  of  opportunities  across  the  population  can,  therefore, 
become  skewed  or  inequitable.  Still,  all  these  challenges  are 
outnumbered by opportunities: cities will continue to stand at 
the crossroads of an interdependent world, producing goods, 
services and ideas within an institutional framework that can 
either overcome or exacerbate the urban divide. 

Equal Opportunities: Catalysts for Distributive Change

The five strategic steps described above provide municipal 
authorities  with  the  overall  strategic  framework  they 
need to bridge the urban divide and move towards a more 
inclusive  city.  This  dynamic  framework  is  designed  to 
support  local  rights-based  policies  that  tackle  exclusion  in 
its various dimensions and redistribute opportunities across 
urban  populations.  In  this  respect,  UN-HABITAT  policy 
analysis  has  identified  five  catalysts  for  distributive  change 
that  municipal  authorities  can  activate  in  cooperation  with 
provincial and national government. These catalysts overlap 
with  the  four  dimensions  of  exclusion/inclusion  as  well  as 
with the recognized international rights implicitly subsumed 
in the “right to the city”. More specifically, improvements in 
the living conditions of the urban poor, investment in human 
capital and fostering employment opportunities are designed 
to affirm social and economic inclusion and rights, and the 
other two catalysts explicitly focus on political and cultural 
inclusion and rights. Socioeconomic inclusion calls for land 
tenure reform and capital investment in infrastructure, which 
create  the  conditions  for  people  to  fulfill  their  individual 
potential. The catalysts for distributive change involve local 
government  practices  that  foster  political  inclusion,  as  well 
as budgeting and planning procedures that achieve cultural 
inclusion through direct involvement of ethnic minorities in 
decision-making. The five policy catalysts are as follows:

a)  Improve  quality  of  life,  especially  for  the  urban  poor. 
Creating  the  conditions  for  improved  access  to  safe  and 
healthy  shelter,  secure  tenure,  basic  services  and  social 
amenities such as health and education, is essential to any 
individual’s  physical,  psychological,  social  and  economic 
development and well-being.

b)  Invest  in  human  capital  formation.  Cities  and  regions 
are  well-placed  to  ensure  strategic  coordination  between 
the institutions and various stakeholders involved in human 
capital formation, and to design policies that are well-adjusted 
to  local  needs.  Such  capital  formation  is  a  condition  for 
socioeconomic development and a more equitable distribution 
of the urban advantage,

c) Foster sustained economic opportunities. Cities can stimulate 
sustained  economic  growth  for  poor  and  underprivileged 
populations through promotion of labour-intensive projects. 
These  include  primarily  public  works  and  the  construction 
industry, which can give opportunities for support to small-
scale  enterprises  and  the  informal  sector.  Moreover,  and  in 
close  cooperation  with  national  government,  a  number  of 
cities in the developing world have launched various forms of 
social security or protection schemes in a bid to expand access 
to  economic  opportunities  for  those  traditionally  excluded 
from mainstream wealth creation and economic development. 
In this respect, conditional cash transfers (CCTs) stand out 
as  the  most  efficient  poverty  reduction  mechanism.  These 
schemes enhance incomes in the short run and capabilities 
in the long run.

d)  Enhance  political  inclusion.  Today,  more  and  more 
municipal  and  national  authorities  share  the  same  basic 
philosophy: bringing government within the reach of ordinary 
people  through  enhanced  mutual  engagement.  Some  of 
these municipalities are constantly trying out new modes of 
political participation, creating permanent fora for dialogue 
and negotiation. The physical space is becoming a political 
space in terms of systems of representation and participation, 
and in this sense is a fundamental aspect of local democracy. 
e) Promote cultural inclusion. Culture has historically been left 
out of the conventional international development agenda, or 
relegated to its fringes. However, more and more scholars and 
experts have come to realize that some cities in the South have 
opted for a more comprehensive perspective on development, 
one where culture features as one of the levers of success. More 
and more local development policies and strategies are by now 
mainstreaming some of the cultural dimensions of urban life, 
such as social capital, tradition, symbols, meaning, sense of 
belonging and pride of place, on top of optimal use of local 
cultural resources by local communities. A number of cities 
today are using culture as a transformational tool to integrate 
ethnic minorities, preserve regional values, safeguard linguistic 
and religious diversity, resolve conflicts, protect the heritage in 
the built environment, and in the process promote economic 
development. Beyond the sole cultural sphere, these policies 
together can go a long way towards bridging the urban divide 
in its other – social, political and economic – dimensions.

It takes five catalysts to integrate the poor and marginalized 
into mainstream urban life: improved quality of life, investment 
in human capital formation, sustained economic opportunities, 
enhanced political inclusion, and cultural inclusion.

Quick Facts 

1.  In the developing world, the region with the 
greatest proportion of people living in urban 
centres is Latin America and the Caribbean, 
whereas sub-Saharan Africa – and Eastern 
Africa in particular – has the lowest percentage 
of urban dwellers. 

2.  Urbanization remains a driving force of 

demographic change, though it is slowing 
down at different paces in different parts of 
the world.

3.  Suburbanization and urban sprawl are 

happening in different places throughout the 
world, spreading low-density urban patterns 
and negative environmental, economic and 
social externalities. 

4.  Urban sprawl in an environment of poverty 

exacerbates the urban divide.

Policy Points 

1.  Suburbanization in developing countries comes 

mainly as an escape from poor governance, 
lack of planning and poor access to amenities. 
Rich and poor escape to find refuge outside the 
city, which generates further partitioning of the 
physical and social space. 

2.  Conurbations are turning into mega-regions, 

city-regions and urban corridors, and 
outside these engines of global and regional 
economies isolated cities have fewer chances 
to prosper. 

3.  Worldwide urbanization is inevitable, and 

generally positive, but equality or inequality in 
cities is influenced by policy choices.

4.  Too many countries have adopted an 

ambivalent or hostile attitude to the 
urbanization process, with negative 
consequences.

Cross-currents in 
global urbanization

our Shared Urban Future

The  United  Nations  predicts  that  by  the  year 

2030, more people in every region of the world 
will  live  in  urban  than  in  rural  areas,  even 
in  Asia  and  Africa,  which  are  now  the  least 
urbanized parts of the globe.1 Our shared future will largely 
come  about  through  the  social,  political,  economic,  and 
cultural dynamic that is urbanization – the convergence of 
human activity and aspiration in all cities, regardless of size. 
The urbanization process is characterized not only by demo-
graphic shifts from rural to urban areas, or by the growth of urban 
populations, but also by changes in various aspects of society: 

•	 in the employment sector, from agriculture-based activities 

to mass production and service industries; 
•	 in societal values and modes of governance; 
•	 in 

the  configuration  and 

functionality  of  human 

settlements; 

•	 in the spatial scale, density and activities of places; and 
•	 in the composition of social, cultural and ethnic groups and 
the  extension  of  democratic  rights,  particularly  women’s 
empowerment.

This  chapter  identifies  the  trends,  both  convergent  and 
divergent, that characterize urbanization in various regions and 
countries against a background of significant recent changes, 
such as accelerated expansion or shrinking of cities, ageing 
populations, urban and regional dynamics and location factors, 
among others. Analysis of global trends helps raise awareness of 
where there is a need to maximize gains and locate or relocate 
investments  and  opportunities,  and  provides  information 
about how to plan for more sustainable development. Such 
analysis also points to the need to design economic recovery 
policies, rethink urban and regional strategies and create new 
opportunities;  it  also  offers  insights  into  to  the  best  ways 
of  anticipating  urbanization  and  managing  the  negative 
consequences of urban growth, such as asymmetrical regional 
and  urban  development  and  various  types  of  disparities.

Convergent Urban growth Patterns 

A slower though more pervasive urbanization

If current projections are anything to go by, virtually the 
whole of the world’s demographic growth over the next 30 
years will be concentrated in urban areas – a stark contrast 
with  the  pattern  that  prevailed  between  1950  and  1975,  a 
period characterized by a much more balanced split between 
urban  and  rural  areas.2  At  the  same  time,  the  pace  of 
urbanization in the world is not accelerating, not even in the 
developing  world.  On  a  global  scale,  the  urban  population 
is  expected  to  grow  at  an  average  annual  rate  of  roughly 
1.5  per  cent  from  2025  to  2030.  The  decade  when  urban 
demographic expansion was at its fastest across the world was 
the  1950s,  with  an  annual  growth  rate  of  over  3  per  cent. 
By  the  late  1980s,  this  pace  had  slowed  to  an  annual  2.7 
per cent. Between 2010 and 2015, the annual growth of the 
global urban population is expected to slow even further, to 
1.9 per cent.3 Developing countries are also experiencing a 
slowdown in overall population growth, from an annual 4.1 
per cent in the early 1960s to 2.5 per cent in 2010; similarly, 
urban population growth in the developing world is expected 
to  fall  to  an  annual  1.8  per  cent  between  2025  and  2030.
For all this notable slowdown in urban population growth 
rates  around  the  world,  current  trends  and  projections 

suggest  that  urbanization  is  to  continue  in  both  developed 
and  developing  regions  of  the  world.  More  specifically,  by 
2050 urban dwellers will likely account for 86 per cent of the 
population in the more developed and 67 per cent in the less 
developed regions. Overall, it is expected that 7 out of 10 people 
will be living in urban areas by 2050. In the less urbanized 
regions of the world, namely, Africa and Asia, the proportion 
of the urban population is expected to increase to 61.8 per cent 
and 66.2 per cent, respectively, by the middle of the century. 

Urbanization is strongly linked to the development process

Already, half of the world’s population is urban, and it can 
only  become  more  so  in  the  future.  Even  though  various 
countries  are  on  different  paths  of  economic  development 
and  are  making  the  urban  transition  at  different  times 
and  with  different  urban  growth  patterns,  it  remains  quite 
clear  that  urbanization  is  an  inevitable  outcome  of  the 
development process. The real challenge is for governments 
to adopt policies that maximize the benefits of urbanization. 
A country’s degree of urbanization, as measured by the share 
of its urban population in relation to total population, is also 
an apt indicator of its wealth. Most nations with high per capita 
incomes are among the most urbanized, just as most of those 
with low per capita incomes are among the least urbanized. 
Empirical  evidence  clearly  demonstrates  that  as  a  country

becomes more urban, its per capita income also tends to rise, as 
shown in Figure 1.1.1. In this sample, only Liberia, a country 
recently ravaged by civil war, has experienced a decline in per 
capita income while its population was becoming more urban, 
indicating that internal conflicts (which in this particular case 
drove thousands of rural people to seek the security of towns 
and cities) have serious consequences for economic growth.
The link between urbanization and economic development 
is  clear  in  Asia,  where  rapid  urbanization  has  been  the 
major factor behind the growth dynamic, in the process also 
contributing to overall reductions in poverty rates.4 In Latin 
America,  economic  development  and  urbanization  have 
historically been linked in a process of industrialization and 
modernization, even though this has resulted in high degrees 
of inequality between and within countries. In Africa, the link 
between  urbanization  and  economic  development  is  more 
tenuous, particularly in sub-Saharan countries; however, recent 
research  suggests  a  positive  link  between  the  two  variables 
in  most  African  countries,  as  is  generally  the  case  in  other 
regions.5 For instance, Rwanda in the late 1990s experienced 
a very high annual urban growth rate of more than 17 per 
cent  as  the  country  rebuilt  after  a  severe  conflict;  the  pace 
slowed  down  to  a  relatively  high  7  per  cent  between  2000 
and 2005, and to just over 4 per cent between 2005 and 2010 
(estimates). At the same time, rapid urbanization in Rwanda 
over  the  last  decade  has  gone  hand  in  hand  with  healthy 
economic  indicators  as  annual  growth  rates  have  ranged 
between 3 and 9 per cent since 2002.6 Although today less than 
20 per cent of Rwanda’s population is urban, the proportion 
is expected to rise to nearly 30 per cent by 2030, compared 
with just 20 per cent in neighbouring Uganda and Burundi.7 

Urbanization and economic growth are inextricably linked 
not only at the national level, but in regions within individual 
countries, too. Those regions experiencing economic growth 
also  tend  to  urbanize  quickly,  and  those  urbanizing  faster 
typically  experience  higher  rates  of  economic  growth. 
Cities  along  China’s  eastern  seaboard  are  a  good  example, 
but  there  are  many  others,  such  as  the  National  Capital 
Region in the Philippines, the Mekong River Delta in Viet 
Nam,  Maputo  and  the  Southern  Region  of  Mozambique, 
and  Tangier-Tetouan  in  northern  Morocco,  to  name  just 
a  few.  Those  regions  that  are  economically  successful  are 
not  only  more  urbanized  than  others  in  the  same  country: 
they  are  also  experiencing  urban  population  growth  rates 
that  are  roughly  two  to  three  times  the  national  average. 
Whether urbanization influences economic growth, or the 
reverse, remains a moot point. What is quite clear, though, 
is that the level of urbanization (or the proportion of people 
living  in  urban  areas)  is  associated  in  some  places  with 
numerous, positive societal outcomes, such as technological 
innovation,  various  forms  of  creativity,  economic  progress, 
higher standards of living, enhanced democratic accountability, 
and women’s empowerment.8 In this sense, urbanization can 
be a positive force for economic development, and also one 
that has desirable social and political outcomes; indeed, some 
of the world’s fastest-growing cities are also among the best 
governed, and some provide the best quality of life in their 
respective nations.9 In those cases where urbanization has not 
been concomitant with significant improvements in quality of 
life or governance, other, divisive factors may be at play, such as 
extreme inequalities, conflict, inadequate or ineffective policies, 
which can block development or substantially set back progress.

Novel urban configurations: Mega-regions, urban 
corridors and city-regions

As  the  world  becomes  more  urban,  new  residents  will 
continue to be distributed across cities of all sizes and much 
along  the  current  prevalent  pattern.10  In  some  instances, 
though,  cities  are  merging  together  to  create  urban 
settlements  on  a  massive  scale.  These  new  configurations 
take  the  form  of  mega-regions,  urban  corridors  and  city-
regions (see Map 1.1.1). Mega-regions are natural economic 
units  that  result  from  the  growth,  convergence  and  spatial 
spread  of  geographically  linked  metropolitan  areas  and 
other  agglomerations.11  They  are  polycentric  urban  clusters 
surrounded  by  low-density  hinterlands,  and  they  grow 
considerably faster than the overall population of the nations 
in  which  they  are  located.12  Urban  corridors,  on  the  other 
hand,  are  characterized  by  linear  systems  of  urban  spaces 
linked  through  transportation  networks.13  Other  dynamic 
and strategic cities are extending beyond their administrative 
boundaries and integrating their hinterlands to become full-
blown city-regions.14 These are emerging in various parts of 
the world, turning into spatial units that are territorially and 
functionally  bound  by  economic,  political,  socio-cultural, 
and  ecological  systems.15  All  of  these  urban  configurations 
–  cities  in  clusters,  corridors  and  regions  –  are  becoming 
the  new  engines  of  both  global  and  regional  economies.
Mega-regions today are accumulating even larger populations 
than any mega- or meta-city (defined by UN-HABITAT as 
a city with a population that exceeds 20 million), and their 
economic  output  is  enormous.  The  population  of  China’s 
Hong Kong-Shenzen-Guangzhou mega-region, for example, 
is about 120 million, and it is estimated that Japan’s Tokyo-

Nagoya-Osaka-Kyoto-Kobe mega-region is likely to host 60 
million by 2015.16 In Brazil, the mega-region that stretches 
from  São  Paulo  to  Rio  de  Janeiro  is  home  to  43  million 
people.  Although  more  widespread  in  North  America  and 
Europe,  mega-regions  are  taking  shape  in  Asia  and  other 
parts of the world as cities converge apace, with the typical 
huge demographic concentrations, large markets, significant 
economic capacities, substantial innovative activities and high 
numbers  of  skilled  workers  that  come  with  them.  Recent 
research shows that the world’s 40 largest mega-regions cover 
only a tiny fraction of the habitable surface of our planet and are 
home to fewer than 18 per cent of the world’s population, even 
as they account for 66 per cent of global economic activity and 
about 85 per cent of technological and scientific innovation.17
Urban  corridors,  in  contrast,  present  a  type  of  spatial 
organization  with  specific  economic  and  transportation 
objectives.  In  urban  corridors,  a  number  of  city  centres  of 
various sizes are connected along transportation routes in linear 
development axes that are often linked to a number of mega-
cities, encompassing their hinterlands. New developments in 
some fringe areas experience the fastest growth rates and the 
most rapid urban transformation. An example is the industrial 
corridor  developing  in  India  between  Mumbai  and  Delhi, 
which  will  stretch  over  1,500  kilometres  from  Jawaharlal 
Nehru Port (in Navi Mumbai) to Dadri and Tughlakabad (in 
Delhi).18  Another  good  example  is  the  manufacturing  and 
service industry corridor in Malaysia’s Kuala Lumpur, clustered 
within  the  Klang  Valley  conurbation  that  stretches  all  the 
way to the port city of Klang.19 In Africa, the greater Ibadan-
Lagos-Accra urban corridor, spanning roughly 600 kilometres 
across four countries, is the engine of West Africa’s regional 
economy.20 Another urban corridor is the 1,500 kilometre-

long belt stretching from Beijing to Tokyo via Pyongyang and 
Seoul, which connects no less than 77 cities with populations 
of 200,000 or more. More than 97 million people live in this 
urban corridor, which, in fact, links four separate megalopolises 
in  four  countries,  merging  them  into  one,  as  it  were.21
Urban corridors are changing the functionality of cities and 
even towns both large and small, in the process stimulating 
business, real estate development and land values along their 
ribbon-like development areas. They are also improving inter-
connectivity  and  creating  new  forms  of  interdependence 
among  cities,  leading  to  regional  economic  development 
growth. In some cases, however, urban corridors can result in 
severe urban primacy and unbalanced regional development, 
as  they  strengthen  ties  to  existing  economic  centres  rather 
than  allowing  for  more  diffused  spatial  development.
City-regions come on yet another, even larger scale as major 
cities extend beyond formal administrative boundaries to engulf 
smaller ones, including towns. In the process, they also absorb 
semi-urban and rural hinterlands, and in some cases merge 
with  other  intermediate  cities,  creating  large  conurbations 
that  eventually  form  city-regions.  Many  such  city-regions 
have grown enormously over the last 20 to 30 years, owing 
to the effects of agglomeration economies and comparative 
advantages. The extended Bangkok Region in Thailand, for 
example, is expected to expand another 200 kilometres from 
its  current  centre  by  2020,  growing  far  beyond  its  current 
population of over 17 million. In Brazil, Metropolitan São 
Paulo  already  spreads  over  8,000  square  kilometres,  with  a 
population of 16.4 million.22 The full extent of South Africa’s 
Cape Town city-region, when including the distances from 
which commuters travel to and from every day, reaches up to 
100 kilometres. Some of these city-regions are actually larger 
in both surface area and population than some entire countries 
like  Belgium,  the  Czech  Republic  or  the  Netherlands. 
Mega-regions, urban corridors and city-regions reflect the 
emerging  links  between  city  growth  and  new  patterns  of 
economic activity. These regional systems are creating a new 
urban hierarchy and the scope, range and complexity of issues 
involved require innovative coordination mechanisms for urban 
management and governance. The World Bank has identified 
the three main issues that these configurations face, namely: 

•	 Coordination,  “conceiving  the  development  of  cities  in 
parallel with the development of regions and sub-regions, 
rather  than  isolated  nodes  in  economic  space”,  a  process 
that calls on metropolitan, regional and even national plan-
ners to work together; 

•	 Broader  plans  for  regional  planning/development,  “requir-
ing dispersion of specific urban functions (i.e., solid waste 
treatment,  airports,  skills  and  training  centres)  within  a 
continuous region, rather than crowding them in a large 
city”; and

•	 Coping  with  horizontal  fiscal  disparities,  and  more  spe-
cifically 
transfer  fiscal 
resources  among  urban  governments  in  a  region”.23

Suburbanization is becoming more prevalent 

 
More  and  more  people,  particularly  young  families  and 
the affluent middle-aged, are living in satellite or dormitory 
cities  and  suburban  neighbourhoods,  taking  advantage  of 
accommodation that can be more affordable than in central 
areas, with lower densities and a better quality of life in certain 
ways. In some cases, spatial expansion of cities is triggered by 
factors other than residents’ preference for a suburban lifestyle. 
These include land regulation crises, lack of control over peri-
urban  areas,  weak  planning  control  over  land  subdivisions 
that  leads  to  various  forms  of  speculation,  improved  or 
expanded  commuting  technologies  and  services,  as  well  as 
greater population mobility. Some of the other factors behind 
suburbanization are characteristic of poorly managed cities, 
such as pollution, traffic congestion, lack of car parks and poor 
public amenities. Spatial expansion is also triggered by changes 
in lifestyles that are disseminated through large urban centres, 
propelled by the globalization of consumption patterns, in turn 
bringing more homogeneity across diverse areas of the world.24
The suburban growth pattern of urbanization has long been 
strongly associated with North American cities; over the past 
decade, though, there have been signs that suburbanization, 
or  what  is  known  as  a  form  of  “horizontal  spreading”, 
“dispersed  urbanization”  or  urban  sprawl,  is  happening  in 
many  metropolitan  areas  of  the  world.  Urban  sprawl  has 
always been a pejorative term for the uncontrolled expansion 
of  urban  areas,  characterized  by  voracious  consumption  of 
land  for  the  purposes  of  low-density  development.  Under 
the many forms it takes in various cities of the world, sprawl 
happens when population growth and the physical expansion 
of  a  city  are  misaligned.  The  Los  Angeles  metropolitan 
area in the United States is a classic case in point: between 
1970  and  1990,  its  population  grew  by  45  per  cent, 
while  its  built  surface  area  expanded  by  300  per  cent.25
Urban  sprawl  is  increasingly  happening  in  developing 
countries  as  well,  as  real  estate  developers  are  promoting 
the  image  of  a  “worldclass  lifestyle”  outside  the  city. 
Research  in  Guadalajara,  Mexico,  between  1970  and  the 
year 2000 showed that the surface area of the city grew 1.5 
times  faster  than  the  population.26  Similar  research  shows 
that  urban  sprawl  is  consuming  considerable  amounts  of 
land  in  cities  as  diverse  as  Antananarivo  in  Madagascar, 
Beijing  in  China,  Johannesburg  in  South  Africa,  Cairo 
in  Egypt  and  Mexico  City  in  Mexico,  to  name  just  a  few. 
In both developing and developed countries, sprawl involves 
four  dimensions:  a  population  that  is  widely  scattered  in 
low-density developments; residential and commercial areas 
that are spatially separate; a network of roads characterized 
by overstretched blocks and poor access; and a lack of well-
defined,  thriving  activity  hubs,  such  as  “downtown”  areas 
and  city  centres.  Other  features  typically  associated  with 
sprawl  include  overdependence  on  motorized  transport 
coupled  with  a  lack  of  alternatives,  a  relative  uniformity 
of  housing  options,  and  pedestrian-unfriendly  spaces.27

For  instance,  most  South  African  cities  are  expanding 
primarily through development of new housing areas which, 
being  located  beyond  the  existing  urban  periphery,  are 
relatively unplanned. As a result, the urban periphery consists 
of  pockets  of  housing  developments  that  are  isolated  and 
separated  from  each  other  by  trunk  roads  or  open  spaces. 
In  many  developing  countries,  urban  sprawl  generates 
a  configuration  involving  two  main,  contrasting  types 
of  development  in  one  and  the  same  city:  (1)  a  form  of 
“peripherization”  that  is  characterized  by  large  peri-urban 
areas with informal and illegal patterns of land use, combined 
with a lack of infrastructure, public facilities and basic services, 
and  often  accompanied  by  a  lack  of  both  public  transport 
and  adequate  access  roads;  and  (2)  in  contrast,  a  form  of 
“suburban sprawl” characterized by residential zones for high- 
and  middle-income  groups  and  highly  valued  commercial 
and  retail  complexes  that  are  well-connected  by  individual 
rather than public transport. In most cases, residential areas 
coexist  with  huge  commercial  centres  located  along  main 
highways.28 In some developing countries, urban sprawl is the 
consequence of poverty, not affluence, as informal unplanned 
settlements on the periphery spring up in response to a lack 
of  affordable  housing  options  within  the  city  itself.  In  this 
sense, urban sprawl results from a lack of policy attention to 
current  urban  challenges  (slums,  land,  services,  transport), 
and more particularly an inability to anticipate urban growth, 
including  through  provision  of  land  for  the  urbanizing 
poor.  Denial  of  permanent  land  rights  to  the  urban  poor 
is  one  of  the  main  factors  behind  the  “peripherization” 
associated  with  urban  sprawl  in  developing  countries.29
From  a  social  and  spatial  perspective,  urban  sprawl 
contributes to the urban divide. It has a negative impact not 
only  on  the  infrastructure  and  sustainability  of  cities,  but 
also on social cohesion, often exacerbating social segregation 
and  segmentation.  The  spatial  separation  of  social  groups, 

particularly  along  socio-economic  lines,  results  in  spatial 
disparities in wealth and quality of life across various parts 
of  cities  and  metropolitan  areas,  dilapidated  city  centres, 
and  suburbs. To  put  it  in  a  nutshell:  sprawl  is  a  symptom 
of  a  divided  city.  Suburbanization  in  developing  countries 
happens  mainly  as  an  escape  away  from  poor  governance, 
lack  of  planning  and  poor  access  to  amenities.  “Rich  and 
poor  find  refuge  in  escaping  the  city”30,  which  generates 
further  partitioning  of  the  physical  and  social  space.  
Urban sprawl has a wide range of implications. In most cases, 
it will lead to an increase in the cost of public infrastructure and 
of residential and commercial development. Sprawl adds to 
the costs and inefficiencies of transportation, resulting in high 
energy consumption. Sprawling metropolitan areas consume 
much  more  energy  than  compact  cities  and  require  larger 
outputs of materials such as metal, concrete and asphalt because 
homes, offices and utilities are farther apart.31 Sprawl also creates 
fiscal problems for cities, as it takes place outside of urban 
administrative  boundaries.  While  suburban  municipalities 
benefit  from  tax  revenues  with  increased  development,  it 
is  central  cities  or  downtown  municipalities  that  foot  the 
bill  for  many  daytime  services  used  by  suburban  residents. 
Moreover, in many places, urban sprawl causes significant 
losses of prime farmland as new developments absorb arable 
land. In the absence of proper planning, urban sprawl also 
contributes to the degradation of a number of environmental 
resources;  for  instance,  it  has  caused  substantial  damage 
to  environmentally  sensitive  areas  around  several  cities  in 
Latin America, including Panama City and its surrounding 
Canal Zone, Caracas and its adjacent coastline, San José de 
Costa Rica and its mountainous area, and São Paulo and its 
water  basins.  Informal  provision  of  services  to  the  poor  in 
peri-urban areas is also very wasteful and expensive (to the 
poor  in  the  short  term,  and  to  the  city  in  the  long  term) 
and is a further significant cause of urban dysfunctionality.

Divergent Urban growth Patterns
 
While  similar  modes  of  urbanization  and  urban  growth 
are  evident  in  many  cities  around  the  world,  there  are 
also  significant  differences  in  the  patterns  of  urbanization 
among  regions  and  even  greater  variations  in  the  degree, 
pace and nature of individual country and city growth. This 
section  discusses  the  most  distinct  and  unique  patterns  of 
urbanization and urban growth in various regions of the world.

No uniform “tipping point” across regions

Sometime during the year 2008, and for the first time in 
human history, the world’s population became more urban 
than  rural.  Although  more  people  overall  are  now  living 
in  urban  centres  than  in  rural  areas,  not  all  regions  have 
yet  experienced  their  own  urban  transitions;  in  fact,  some 
regions  are  not  expected  to  reach  the  urban  population 
“tipping point” for another 20 to 30 years. (See Table 1.1.1)

significant  efforts 

In  the  more  developed  regions  (Europe,  North  America 
and  Oceania),  the  tipping  point  from  a  predominantly 
rural  to  a  majority  urban  population  occurred  in  the  mid-
1950s,  while  in  some  countries,  such  as  the  United  States, 
it took place as early as the beginning of the 20th century.32 
In the developing world, the first and only region to become 
predominantly  urban  before  2008  was  Latin  America  and 
the Caribbean, where at least half of the population has been 
living  in  places  formally  designated  as  “cities”  and  “towns” 
since  the  early  1960s.  Three  distinct  factors  combined  to 
bring  about  this  evolution:  (1)  a  very  unequal  agrarian 
structure, with little capacity to retain the rural population; 
(2)  political  centralism,  which  concentrated  power  in  the 
capitals  of  individual  federated  states,  and  (3)  government 
policies  favouring  import  substitution  (in  some  countries 
since the 1930s, in others since the 1950s).33 A relatively early 
urbanization trend is also notable in two sub-regions of the 
developing world, Southern and North Africa, which passed 
the  “urban  tipping  point”  in  1993  and  2005,  respectively, 
despite 
to  prevent  urbanization.34 
In  today’s  world,  different  regions  find  themselves  at 
different  levels  on  the  urbanization  scale.  At  one  extreme, 
North America boasts the highest proportion of people living 
in urban areas, at 82.1 per cent. The second and third most 
urbanized  regions  are  Latin  America  and  the  Caribbean 
and Europe, with 79.4 per cent and 72.6 per cent of their 
populations living in urban areas, respectively. At the other end 
of the spectrum, Africa and Asia have the lowest proportions 
of urban residents in the world, with 40 per cent and 42.5 
per  cent  of  their  populations  in  urban  areas,  respectively, 
or  significantly  below  the  global  average  of  50.6  per  cent.
Northern Europe is the world’s most urbanized sub-region 
with, on average, 84.4 per cent of its population projected to 
live in urban areas by 2010. The sub-region of South America 
comes next, with 83.7 per cent of its population projected to live 
in cities and towns, slightly more than North America, which 
ranks third. The next most urbanized sub-region is Western 
Europe (77 per cent). At the other end of the urbanization 
spectrum, Eastern Africa ranks last by far, with just 23.7 per 
cent of its population projected to live in urban areas by 2010. 
The proportion is higher in South-Central Asia (32.2 per cent), 
while in Eastern- and South-Eastern Asia rates of urbanization 
remain relatively low, with the urban population accounting 
for just under 50 per cent in both sub-regions (Table 1.1.1).
Caution is in order here as urbanization rates and trends in 
different regions are, of course, largely affected by the formal 
definition of what constitutes a “city” or ”urban area” in every 
country, which in turn seriously affects comparability across 
regions and countries. What constitutes an urban area differs 
from  one  country  to  another.  For  example,  in  Uganda,  a 
settlement with a population of more than 2,000 is classified as 
urban, whereas in Nigeria and Mauritius the benchmark is 10 
times higher; in China, those settlements with more than 3,000 
residents are considered “urban”, while only those with 60,000 
or  more  are  “cities”.  Urban  areas  are  also  typically  defined 
by  the  administrative  and  legislative  functions  they  serve, 
further  complicating  the  designation  of  urban  settlements. 

Considering the challenges of definition and the fact that 
many successive degrees of urbanization separate truly rural 
places and major cities, it is expected that the tipping point 
for “urban Asia” and “urban Africa” will happen in 2023 and 
2030,  respectively.  South-Central  Asia,  the  least  urbanized 
sub-region in Asia, will not achieve the urban transition until 
2040,  primarily  because  in  the  two  large  countries  in  the 
region, India and Bangladesh, seven out of every 10 in the 
population still live in rural areas today. The least urbanized 
part  of  Africa,  the  Eastern  sub-region  where  urbanization 
was not strongly linked to industrialization or modernization 
until  recently,35  will  remain  predominantly  rural  until  after 
2050,  when  projections  suggest  that  only  47.6  per  cent  of 
the population will be living in urban areas. However, huge 
demographic  and  social  transformations  are  occurring  in 
this sub-region, which is currently experiencing the highest 
urban  growth  rate  in  the  world  (3.87  per  cent  in  2000-
2005); this points to the need for local and national policies 
that  respond  positively  to  current  urbanization  challenges.   
By 2050, 70 per cent of the world population is likely to 
be living in urban environments. In this respect, some of the 
patterns emerging in specific projections are worthy of note. 
South America will be the most urban region in the world (91.4 
per cent), followed by Northern Europe (90.7 per cent) and 
North America (90.2 per cent). The least urbanized regions by 
the middle of the 21st century will remain Africa (61.8 per cent) 
and Asia (66.2 per cent): they will be slightly below the global 
average of 70 per cent. It must be stressed that in those two 
continents, the already more urbanized sub-regions – North 
and Southern Africa, and Eastern and Western Asia – will see 
further increases in the urban segment of the population to the 
point where, by 2050, their respective shares of urban dwellers 
will  be  larger  than  those  currently  prevailing  in  Europe. 
The fact that by 2050 Latin America and the Caribbean, 
and  particularly  South  America,  is  projected  to  feature 
the  highest  proportion  of  urban  population  in  the  world 
somewhat  challenges  the  notion  that  urbanization  can  be 
taken  as  a  proxy  for  the  level  of  development  in  general.36 
Notwithstanding  definition  problems,  and  considering  that 
urban data has not been harmonized and urban projections 
are devoid of adjustment factors, it is possible that over the 
next  40  years,  some  countries  in  the  South  American  sub-
region will have significantly reduced poverty and inequalities 
to  the  standards  of  today’s  developed  nations,  while  others 
will not. It is unlikely that by 2050 the sub-region will rank 
among the first in the Human Development Index and boast 
one of the highest GDPs per capita; still, the region shows 
some  promise  in  terms  of  human  development  indicators: 
average life expectancy is comparable to North America’s, and 
infant  mortality  is  the  lowest  among  developing  regions.37 
Moreover,  the  changing  structure  of  urban  patterns  in 
Latin America and the Caribbean, characterized by a rapid 
increase in the number of secondary cities and the reduction 
of urban primacy, is another distinctive feature of the region 
that is certain to bring more prosperity to secondary cities.

Not all cities in developing nations are experiencing rapid 
population growth

By the middle of the 21st century, the total urban population 
of  the  developing  world  will  more  than  double,  from  2.5 
billion in 2010 to 5.3 billion in 2050.38 Between 1995 and 
2005  alone,  the  urban  population  of  the  developing  world 
grew by an average of 1.2 million per week, or around 165,000 
every  day.39  Not  all  cities  contribute  equally  to  this  rapid 
growth,  and  neither  is  it  unprecedented  or  out  of  control.  
Many cities, including Kolkata, Chennai, Recife, Santiago, 
Monterrey,  Algiers,  Alexandria,  Maputo  and  Lusaka  are 
experiencing relatively low annual growth rates (1 to 2 per 
cent),  and  further  slowdowns  are  likely  over  the  coming 
years.  Somewhat  surprisingly,  a  number  of  other  cities 
in  the  developing  world  find  themselves  experiencing 
population  declines  (particularly  in  central  areas),  such  as 
Rabat, La Paz, Belo Horizonte, San Luis Potosi, Dengzhou, 
Madurai,  Bandung  and  Manila,  to  name  just  a  few. 
On the other hand, recent high annual growth rates of over 4 
per cent have rapidly transformed many cities in the developing 
world,  including  Bamako,  Abuja,  Kinshasa,  Ouagadougou 
and Sana’a, suggesting that on current trends their populations 
will double in about 17 years. Some of the fastest-expanding 
cities  have  seen  their  populations  double  in  fewer  than 
eight  years,  owing  to  phenomenal  annual  growth  rates  of 
over 8 per cent (see Figures 1.1.2-4). Some cities in China, 
such  as  Shenzhen  and  Shangqiu,  experienced  exceptionally 

high annual growth rates of over 17 per cent in the 1990s. 
Across  Africa,  rapid  urban  expansion  is  widespread,  with 
13 agglomerations experiencing annual growth rates of over 
4 per cent. Between 2005 and 2010, Africa experienced the 
highest urban growth rates in the world—an annual 3.3 per 
cent average—and the pace is expected to remain relatively 
high over the next 15 years. On the other hand, demographic 
growth is slowing down in Asian and Latin American cities, 
and  this  is  expected  to  continue  over  the  next  decade. 
Generally  speaking,  high  rates  of  urban  growth  still 
characterize urban change in the developing world, where the 
annual average was 2.5 per cent between 1990 and 2006.40 
However, that is not uniformly the case; for every 100 cities 
in the developing world, 15 grew at high annual rates of over 
4  per  cent,  compared  with  2  to  4  per  cent  for  another  32 
cities. On the other hand, more than half (53 out of 100) 
grew rather slowly: 1 to 2 per cent for 22 of these, and under 1 
per cent for another 19. Moreover, 11.4 per cent of cities saw 
both their economies and their populations regress between 
1990 and 2006. Declining urban populations is a relatively 
new phenomenon in the developing world, though not yet 
as  prevalent  as  in  the  developed  world  where  a  significant 
40 per cent of cities have seen a fall in their populations.41 
Demographic contraction may, however, pave the way for a new 
urban trend that is starting to unfold in the developing world.

PREDoMiNaNTly RURal
Although they can boast some of the highest urban growth rates, 
East African countries remain the least urbanized in the world and 
will only begin to experience an urban transition by the middle of this 
century.	Only	22.7	per	cent	of	the	region’s	population	was	classified	
as	“urban”	in	2007,	with	some	countries	featuring	significantly	lower	
proportions. The least urbanized countries include Burundi (10.1 per 
cent), Ethiopia (16.6 per cent), Rwanda (18.2 per cent) and Uganda 
(12.8 per cent). It is worth noting here that countries with similar 
income levels and human development indicators, such as Benin in 
Western Africa and Angola in Central Africa, feature higher rates of 
urbanization – 40.8 per cent and 55.8 per cent, respectively.

In  East  Africa  between  2005  and  2010  (estimate),  annual  urban 
growth rates range from a high of 6.8 per cent in Burundi to a low of 
1.4 per cent in the Seychelles. Countries with relatively high annual 
urban growth rates over 4 per cent include Eritrea, Ethiopia, Malawi, 
Mozambique, Rwanda, Somalia, Tanzania and Uganda. It must be 
noted that while most East African countries are expected to see 
a deceleration in the growth of their urban population rates in the 
next decade, a few may instead experience a surge. For instance, 
having featured an annual rate of 3.9 per cent between 2005 and 
2010  (estimate),  Kenya’s  urban  population  growth  is  expected  to 
accelerate to 4.2 per cent between 2015 and 2020. Similarly, pro-
jections suggest that Uganda’s urban growth rates are bound for a 
significant	rise,	from	the	current	4.4	per	cent	to	over	5	per	cent	in	
the next decade.

However, high urban growth rates in East Africa are not anywhere 
near the “tipping point” where a national population becomes pre-
dominantly urban. United Nations projections indicate that by 2030, 
only 33.7 per cent of the region’s total population will be urban. For 
most countries – except those already highly urbanized, such as Dji-
bouti, Mauritius, Reunion and Seychelles – the transition will only 
occur after 2040, with the exception of Mozambique, Somalia and 
Zimbabwe, where it is expected by 2030. 

The low rates of urbanization in East Africa result from a variety of 
factors, including low industrialization, over-dependence on subsis-
tence	agriculture,	inadequate	or	outdated	land	policies,	lack	of	pro-
urban	development	strategies,	insufficient	investment	in	secondary	
and small cities, past colonial policies that discouraged rural-to-urban 
migration,	and	apparent	lack	of	political	will	to	address	the	“urban	
question” and turn cities and towns into engines of national growth. 

Another particular aspect of the urbanization process in the least ur-
banized	East	African	countries	is	that	of	“divided	loyalties”	–	conflicts	
between communal loyalty and obligations to ancestral rural land, 
or to clan and family ties, on the one hand, and the need to adapt 
to and participate in a modern, urbanizing world, on the other hand. 
This phenomenon prevents many rural migrants from fully embracing 
the city as their home or engaging with local authorities to demand 
better services and rights. Consequently, many cities in the region 
can  be  described  as  hosting  “transplanted  villagers”  who  are  yet 
to be turned into truly urban citizens whose loyalties, investments, 
livelihoods	and	future	prospects	are	intimately	linked	with	the	cities	
where they live.

The wealth of cities

The City-nation nexus

to 

their 

Thanks 

The prosperity of nations is intimately linked to 

the  prosperity  of  their  cities.  No  country  has 
ever  achieved  sustained  economic  growth  and 
rapid  social  development  without  urbanizing. 
Evidence  shows  that  the  transition  from  low-income  to 
middle-income country status is almost always accompanied 
by  a  transition  from  a  rural  to  an  urban  economy.1
superior  productivity,  urban-based 
enterprises  contribute  large  shares  of  the  gross  domestic 
product (GDP) of nations. In some countries, such as Korea, 
Hungary and Belgium, it takes only a single city to contribute 
the more substantial share of national wealth – almost half 
in the case of Seoul, and roughly 45 per cent in the case of 
Budapest and Brussels.2 In other countries, it is a group of 
cities that accounts for a significant share of national GDP. In 
South Africa, for example, six major cities concentrating 31 per 
cent of the total population together contribute as much as 55 
per cent of national GDP.3 In both India and China, the five 
largest cities contribute approximately 15 per cent of national 
GDP in 2004 – roughly three times what could have been 
expected based solely on their relative shares of the population.4 
Cities have the potential to make countries rich because they 
provide the economies of scale and proximity to make growth 
more  efficient.  High  densities  in  cities  reduce  transaction 
costs,  make  public  spending  on  infrastructure  and  services 
more  economically  viable,  and  facilitate  the  generation 
and diffusion of knowledge, all of which are important for 
growth.  Regardless  of  whether  cities  fuel  economic  growth 
or  are,  instead,  its  by-product,  it  is  indisputable  that  cities 
have become major hubs of economic activity, both within 
individual countries and as contributors to the global economy. 

Quick Facts 

1.  Urbanization and economic growth typically 

happen in tandem; however, equitable 
distribution of benefits and opportunities 
remains a challenge.

2.  Demographic expansion in cities nowadays 
stems more from natural growth than rural-
urban migration, including in sub-Saharan 
Africa.

3.  Urbanization, when accompanied by weak 

economic growth, results in a concentration of 
poor people in cities rather than in significant 
poverty reduction.

4.  Countries with the highest per capita income 
tend to be more urbanized, while low-income 
countries are the least urbanized. 

Policy Points 
1.  Cities have the potential to make countries 
rich because they provide the economies of 
scale and proximity that generate enhanced 
productivity.

2.  Urban centres that are economically growing 

can be real poverty fighters if adequate 
policies are implemented; they can also 
significantly reduce rural poverty.

Table 1.2.1 and Figure 1.2.1 show the relative shares of a 
group of selected cities from both developed and developing 
countries in terms of land size, population and gross domestic 
product  (GDP)  relative  to  the  country  as  a  whole.  In  all 
cases, the economic output of the cities is much higher than 
the corresponding land inputs. In addition, all but one of the 
selected cities contribute a larger share of the country’s GDP 
than  their  share  of  the  total  population.  Guangzhou  and 
Brussels offer the most telling examples, with a GDP share 
that is 5 and 4.4 times higher, respectively, than their share 
in their respective national populations.5 The only exception 
is  Sydney,  which  produces  a  lower  share  of  GDP  than  the 
proportion of the Australian population that calls the city home. 
Exclusive focus on the GDP contribution of urban areas 
can be misleading, though. Rather than individual areas, it 
is often clusters of cities that function as a single economic 
entity  and  set 
in  motion  self-reinforcing,  cumulative 
growth  patterns.6  For  instance,  Johannesburg,  Pretoria  and 
the East Rand function as more of a single city-region – a 
cluster  of  economically  linked  and  interdependent  cities 
–  than  as  three  geographically  separated  cities.  The  three 
have substantial geographical advantages: they are relatively 
close to the largest international airport in Africa, and they 
are well connected through a highway network to the ports 
of  Durban,  Richards  Bay  and  Cape  Town  as  well  as  to 
those in neighbouring Maputo in Mozambique and Walvis 
Bay  in  Namibia.  Taking  this  “cluster”  city  as  a  whole,  its

contribution  to  South  Africa’s  GDP  is  greater  than  31  per 
cent.7 The fact that Johannesburg is host to two-thirds of all 
South Africa’s corporate headquarters and 60 per cent of the 
top  100  companies  underscores  its  economic  importance.8
Cities also concentrate a large share of economic activity 
worldwide. When adjusting the actual GDP per capita by the 
costs of living in individual cities (i.e., purchasing power parity 
– PPP) and ranking them by GDP, the top 25 cities accounted 
for roughly 15 per cent of the world’s GDP in 2005.9 This 
share increases to around one-fourth of the world’s GDP when 
the top 100 cities are included (see Figure 1.2.2). The largest 
cities in the major developed economies are at the top of the 
global GDP rankings, with Tokyo, New York, Los Angeles, 
Chicago, Paris and London being the top six in 2005. Tokyo 
alone  accounts  for  almost  2  per  cent  of  the  world’s  GDP. 
The economic power of these cities is comparable to that 
of many national economies. Tokyo and New York have an 
estimated GDP similar to those of Canada or Spain, while 
London’s GDP is higher than that of Sweden or Switzerland. 
Four megacities in developing countries are currently in the top 
30 GDP ranking – Mexico City, Buenos Aires, São Paulo, and 
Rio de Janeiro – accounting for 1.5 per cent of the global GDP. 
Fast-growing cities such as Shanghai, Mumbai, Istanbul and 
Beijing are expected to move into the global top 30 by 2010.10 
The  larger  contribution  of  some  cities  to  the  country’s 
GDP relative to their share of the population points to the 
advantages of urban areas. Specifically, cities benefit from the 
efficiency gains and consumption benefits arising from location 
advantages, economies of scale and agglomeration economies, 
including lower prices for inputs, greater access to specialized 
services, lower transaction costs, and more fluid knowledge 
sharing. In turn, these advantages attract fast growing sectors 
of the economy, including services and manufacturing, into 
cities – in fact, urban agglomeration seems to be a prerequisite 
for industrialization. The competitive advantages of cities are 
even  more  important  in  developing  countries,  where  poor 
transportation  and  communication  infrastructure  in  the 
hinterland  exacerbates  the  cities’  location  advantages  that 
enable firms to access not only the larger domestic markets 
within  the  cities  themselves,  but  also  export  markets.11  
Data  indicates  that  predominantly  urban  regions  have 
a  consistently  higher  GDP  per  capita  than  those  that  are 
predominantly rural. On average, in 2005, those in OECD 
countries generated a GDP per capita that was 57 per cent 
higher  than  predominantly  rural  regions:  US  $30,882, 
compared with US $19,623.12 The same relationship holds for 
all OECD countries at the national level, with the exception 
of South Korea, where GDP per capita is significantly higher 
in  predominantly  rural  regions  than  in  urban  ones:  US 
$23,886 and US $16,274 in 2005, respectively. This unusual 
pattern reflects a two-pronged government policy: significant 
subsidies stabilize agricultural production in order to maintain 
food security; and expanding non-agricultural industries have 
been turned into a main source of income in rural areas, in 
a  bid  to  promote  economic  equality  with  urban  areas.13  In 
all  other  OECD  countries,  GDP  per  capita  is  consistently

Rural GDP per capita (constant 2000 US$)

Source: World Bank, 2007. 
Note: Rural share of GDP is estimated based on the share of the agricultural sector, while the 
urban share is estimated based on the combined share of GDP produced in the manufacturing 
and service sectors. These are divided by the rural and urban population to obtain the rural 
and urban GDP per capita, respectively.

higher  in  predominantly  urban  areas.  The  urban-rural  gap 
in  terms  of  GDP  per  capita  ranges  between  15  per  cent 
for Japan and 210 per cent in Hungary (see Figure 1.2.3). 
Whether urbanization causes economic growth or economic 
growth causes urbanization, it is indisputable that urbanization 
and growth go together. As shown in Figure 1.2.5, over the past 
four  decades  countries  around  the  world  have  experienced, 
on  average,  increases  in  both  their  urban  population  and 
per  capita  income.  While  the  urban  population  worldwide 
increased from 33 to 42 per cent between 1960 and 2000, 
per capita income more than doubled over the same period.14

The data also suggests a strong empirical relationship between 
urbanization and per capita income across countries.15 As shown 
in Figure 1.2.6, countries with the highest per capita income 
tend to be more urbanized, with at least 70 per cent of their 
population living in urban areas. Likewise, the populations 
of middle-income countries tend to be at least 50 per cent 
urban,  while  low-income  countries  are  the  least  urbanized. 
The  positive  relationship  between  economic  growth  and 
urbanization  is  also  evident  when  countries  are  aggregated 
by  income  level.  As  shown  in  Table  1.2.2,  high-income 
countries  exhibit  both  the  highest  GDP  per  capita  and 
urbanization  levels,  while  low-income  countries  are  at  the 
other end of the spectrum, with the lowest GDP per capita 
and  urbanization  levels.16  Likewise,  those  regions  that 
exhibit  the  highest  levels  of  urbanization  are  also  the  ones 
with  the  highest  GDP  per  capita,  as  illustrated  by  the  fact 
that  Latin  America  and  the  Caribbean,  with  the  highest 
proportion  of  urban  population  in  the  developing  world, 
also  has  a  higher  GDP  per  capita  than  Asia  and  Africa. 
Looking  at  the  sub-regions  of  the  developing  world,  the 
only  exception  to  the  rule  is  sub-Saharan  Africa:  although 
countries  there  tend  to  be  more  urbanized  than  those  in 
Southern  Asia,  their  GDP  per  capita  is  lower  (36  per  cent 
and US $601 in sub-Saharan Africa, compared with 29 per 
cent  and  US  $647  in  Southern  Asia).  This  phenomenon, 
which  some  authors  refer  to  as  “pathological  urbanization” 
(see  Box  1.2.1)  or  “urbanization  without  growth”  does  not 
really  “describe  what  has  been  happening  in  most  African 
countries” 17, which like all other regions of the world feature 
a  normal,  linear  relationship  between  urbanization  and 
economic  growth.  As  explained  by  Kessides,  in  Africa  this 
relationship “has simply not been sufficient to propel most 
of the countries into the realm of per capita income increases 
needed  to  overcome  poverty  sustainably”.18  It  is  expected, 
however, that the relatively high economic growth rates which 
several African countries have experienced these past few years 
will cause proportional increases in the urban population, as 
cities stand to attract more migrants not just from villages, 
but from other cities as well. This trend is in line with those 
in urban Europe in the latter part of the 19th century, when 
the Industrial Revolution led to a surge in urban populations 
and rising incomes. It was only in the early part of the 20th 
century  that  the  problems  associated  with  rapid  urban 
growth – including slum proliferation and inequality – were 
addressed in a significant manner to reduce overall poverty. 
It is important to note that rural-urban migration is just 
one  of  the  three  drivers  of  urbanization  in  today’s  world, 
accounting for only about 25 per cent. The other two factors 
are natural population increases and reclassification of rural 
into  urban  areas  (see  Box  1.3.2).19  Rural-urban  migration 
plays a relatively more significant role in regions with initial 
low rates of urbanization, such as Eastern and Southern Asia, 
sub-Saharan Africa, and North Africa and the Middle East. 
Conversely, it comes as no surprise that natural demographic 
growth within cities is relatively more important in regions 
where large parts of the population are already urban, such as 
Latin America and the Caribbean, Europe and Central Asia. 

Urbanization and poverty

Overall,  the  relationship  between  urbanization  and 
poverty is a positive one, as the incidence of poverty tends 
to  be  less  pronounced  in  urban  than  in  rural  areas.  This 
urban/rural divide tends to prevail across the world. Figure 
1.2.7  shows  the  poverty  rates  in  cities  and  the  countryside 
with  respect  to  the  national  rural  and  urban  poverty  lines, 
for 50 developing countries and between 1998 and 2007.20 
The  figure  suggests  that  on  the  whole,  the  incidence  of 
poverty  is  more  than  60  per  cent  higher  in  rural  than  in 
urban  areas.  Specifically,  almost  half  (48.9  per  cent)  of  the 
rural population in these countries is below the rural poverty 
line,  while  less  than  a  third  (30.3  per  cent)  of  the  urban 
population is below the urban poverty line. The relatively low 
prevalence of urban poverty is largely a result of the fact that 
the high costs of non-food items in cities are not considered 
in  the  poverty  equation.  If  the  cost  of  living  were  factored 
in,  the  prevalence  of  urban  poverty  would  certainly  rise.
At  the  country  level,  this  positive  relationship  between 
urbanization and poverty holds for all but five countries, or 90 
per cent of the cases.21 In other words, the urban-rural poverty 
gap is positive in 45 of the 50 countries. In countries such 
as Viet Nam and Rwanda, the incidence of poverty in rural 
areas  is  roughly  5  times  higher  than  in  urban  areas.  Other 
countries, such as Burundi, show a small gap, as poverty is 
widespread in both rural and urban areas. The exceptions are 
Sri Lanka and the West Asian countries of Georgia, Armenia 
and Azerbaijan, where urban areas feature a higher incidence 
of  poverty  than  rural  areas.  The  gap  is  substantial  in  the 
case  of  Sri  Lanka,  where  urban  poverty  is  more  than  three 
times  higher  than  rural  poverty.  However,  the  relationship 
is less pronounced or negligible in the West Asian countries.

While the traditional rural-urban comparison does indeed 
reveal  that,  as  a  whole,  urban  populations  are  better  off 
than those living in rural areas, this situation conceals some 
profound differences in living conditions within urban areas – 
a major dimension of the urban divide. When disaggregating 
the  data  at  the  rural,  urban,  slum  and  non-slum  levels,  it 
becomes  apparent  that  there  are  remarkable  similarities 
between  living  conditions  in  rural  areas  and  slums  with 

regard  to  social  indicators  such  as  health  and  education.22
Given the lower incidence of relative poverty in urban areas, 
the overall poverty rate (urban and rural) can be expected to 
decline as the share of the urban population rises – assuming 
that the distribution of income within urban or rural areas 
remains unchanged. Urban growth is, therefore, both positive 
and  necessary  for  rural  poverty  reduction.  The  inverse 
relationship  between  urbanization  and  poverty  is  indeed

apparent  in  trendlines  for  both,  over  time  and  in  various 
regions of the world (Figure 1.2.8); this is particularly the case 
in Eastern Asia, where urbanization has steadily increased and 
poverty drastically declined. Cities can be real poverty fighters. 
Although less dramatic, the same pattern of rising urbanization 
and declining poverty is also evident in Southern Asia. On the 
other hand, three regions – Latin America and the Caribbean, 
North Africa and the Middle East, and East/Central Europe 
and  Central  Asia  –  illustrate  the  dismal  legacy  of  poverty 
reduction strategies since the late 20th century. Although the 
population  became  more  urban  in  Latin  America  and  the 
Caribbean  and  North  Africa  and  the  Middle  East  during 
the past two decades, the reduction in poverty experienced 
during  the  1980s  came  to  a  halt  in  the  1990s.  A  similar 
phenomenon occurred in East/Central Europe and Central 
Asia, where poverty increased during the 1990s as the degree 
of urbanization remained largely unchanged. In sub-Saharan 
Africa, a majority of the population will become urban over 
the next 30 years and this “urban transition” represents both 
an opportunity and a challenge. Local and central authorities 
must  develop  sound  policies  and  strategies  to  ensure  that 
urban  areas  become  real  engines  of  national  economic 
growth,  with  the  potential  to  reduce  poverty  and  enhance 
quality of life for all; otherwise, urban growth will result in a 
concentration of poor people in cities instead of rural areas, 
and there will be no significant overall poverty reduction.23
Empirical  evidence  also  indicates  an  inverse  relationship 
between the degree of urbanization and the overall incidence 
of  poverty  in  individual  countries:  as  shown  in  Figure 
1.2.9,  countries  that  are  more  urbanized  tend  to  feature 

lower poverty rates relative to the national poverty line. The 
opposite  seems  to  be  the  case  for  countries  that  are  little 
urbanized, where the incidence of poverty tends to be higher.24
The  empirical  relationship  between  urbanization  and 
poverty  does  not  imply  causality  –  that  is,  urbanization  
per se does not result in overall poverty reduction. More likely, 
the relationship between urbanization and poverty reflects a 
strong  relationship  between  these  two  situations  and  other 
factors like pro-poor policies and economic growth. Hand in 
hand with economic growth, urbanization has helped reduce 
overall  poverty  by  providing  new  opportunities,  raising 
incomes and increasing the numbers of livelihood options for 
both  rural  and  urban  populations.  Urbanization,  therefore, 
does indeed play a positive role in overall poverty reduction, 
particularly  where  supported  by  well-adapted  policies.25
In summary, cities tend to be centres of economic power, 
both within local regions and as contributors to the national 
economy.  Their  influence  results  not  only  from  their  share 
of  the  world’s  population  but  also  from  their  location  and 
economic advantages, including economies of agglomeration 
and scale. The prosperity of cities usually mirrors the prosperity 
of countries, as an increase in urbanization generally goes hand 
in hand with higher GDP per capita, and in some countries 
contributes  to  a  decline  in  overall  poverty  at  the  national 
level. However, cities can also be places of high inequality, as 
increased prosperity often does not result in more egalitarian 
distribution of wealth or income. But, does this urban divide 
really  matter  as  long  as  the  prosperity  of  cities  results  in 
poverty reduction? This important question, as well as what 
causes inequality, is further explored in Part 2 of this Report.

BOx 1.2.1: iS URBaNizaTioN iN aFRica “PaTHological”?
In the past two decades, researchers, economists 
and analysts have tended to view urbanization in 
Africa through a prism of “abnormality” or “excep-
tionalism”.  They  have  described  the  continent’s 
rapid  urban  growth  –  averaging  approximately  4 
per  cent  per  year  in  the  1980s  and  1990s  –  as 
“pathological”  or  “dysfunctional”;  this  suggests 
that,	 unlike	 the	 rest	 of	 the	 world,	 urbanization	 in	
Africa  has  often  not  been  accompanied  by  sus-
tained economic growth or reduced poverty. Fur-
thermore, African countries experiencing what has 
been termed “urbanization without  growth” have 
been diagnosed as either “failed states” or under-
industrialized, agrarian economies that have been 
unable to diversify or improve productivity. 
While	it	is	true	that	economic	growth	did	not	keep	
pace with rising urban populations in several coun-
tries,  particularly  in  the  1980s  and  1990s,  more 
recent evidence paints a different picture. A UN-
HABITAT review of data from 36 African countries 
shows that half of the countries, including Angola, 
Ethiopia, Liberia, Malawi, Mozambique and Sudan, 
experienced relatively high (over 5 per cent) eco-
nomic growth rates in 2006 and 2007, with Angola, 
Ethiopia and Sudan growing at double-digit rates of 
21.1 per cent, 11.1 per cent, and 10.2 per cent, 
respectively. In many of these countries, average 
annual  urban  growth  rates  between  2005  and 
2010	 were	 not	 significantly	 higher	 than	 the	 con-
tinental average of 3.3 per cent. In fact, in South 
Africa and Botswana, where more than 60 per cent 
of the population is urban and which featured GDP 
growth rates of more than 5 per cent in 2006 and 
2007,  annual  urban  growth  rates  between  2005 
and	2010	(estimate)	were	significantly	lower	than	
the continental average, at 1.35 per cent and 2.51 
per cent, respectively. Growth in the formal econ-
omy  of  many  African  countries  has  been  fuelled 
mainly by the industrial (including construction and 
mining)  and  services  sectors,  which  tend  to  be 
urban-based. Of all the economic sectors, includ-
ing agriculture, the services sector has grown the 
fastest in Africa since the 1990s.
Despite robust economic growth in several coun-
tries,  though,  approximately  one-third  of  the  36 
African  countries  under  review  have  experienced 
substantial shifts in population without commensu-
rate poverty reduction. Even though just one coun-
try experienced negative GDP growth in 2006 and 
2007, GDP growth per capita provides a different 
perspective.  One-third  of  the  countries,  including 
Burundi, Eritrea, Guinea, Mali, Niger and Togo, fea-
tured negative GDP per capita growth rates during 
2006 and 2007, with Zimbabwe experiencing the 
worst at -6.0 per cent. In some countries, such as 
Kenya, relatively high economic growth rates from 
2003 to 2007 have been undercut by recent civil 

strife and political factors, which hindered econom-
ic growth and productivity in 2008 and 2009.
Furthermore,  the  concerns  of  outside  observers 
have	 been	 justified	 by	 the	 experiences	 of	 many	
African  countries  where  high  economic  growth 
rates  have  not  led  directly  to  reductions  in  slum 
populations or urban poverty. This would point to a 
pattern of “pathological” urban growth which, fun-
damentally,	reflects	a	lack	of	political	will	to	tackle	
urban  poverty  in  a  systematic  way,  but  can  also 
derive from the poor performance of policies and 
programmes  in  many  countries.  As  discussed  in 
Part 2 of this Report, development strategies and 
related interventions have, to a large extent, been 
dictated by powerful interest groups. In some cas-
es social policies, including those involving donor 
assistance, have proved to be extremely ineffec-
tive. High slum prevalence in many African cities 
can also be attributed to structural and political fail-
ures in the distribution of public goods, as well as 
to	lack	of	human	and	financial	resources	to	address	
urban	poverty.	Against	this	background,	economic	
growth in many cases has had little impact on ei-
ther poverty or inequality, or both. In other words, 
sustained economic growth has not been in a posi-
tion to drive the urbanization process with desirable 
results. In the fastest growing African economies, 
such as oil-rich Angola and Sudan, slum dwellers 
constitute  the  majority  –  more  than  80  per  cent 
– of the urban population. Poor agricultural yields 
and civil war have been blamed for the high urban 
and slum growth rates in these countries, as rural 
migrants	have	flocked	to	cities	to	escape	hunger	or	
conflict.	While	natural	population	growth	in	African	
cities  is  increasingly  the  norm  (more  people  are 
born in cities than migrate to them), continued civil

strife and environmental crises in some countries 
are still pushing rural populations to urban areas, 
where the majority of the migrants end up in slums 
or poorly-serviced neighbourhoods. 
Although rural poverty rates tend to be higher than 
those in urban areas, the gap is rapidly closing. In 
Kenya,  for  instance,  the  urban  and  rural  poverty 
rates in 1997 were 49 per cent and 53 per cent, re-
spectively. Projections for 2020 indicate that urban 
poverty will account for more than 40 per cent of 
total  poverty  in  several  African  countries,  includ-
ing Benin, Cameroon, Kenya, Mauritania, Mozam-
bique, Nigeria, Senegal and Tanzania. These pro-
jections suggest that rapid urbanization may lead 
to a shift in the locus of poverty in Africa from rural 
to urban areas, leaving cities with a larger share of 
total poverty in the coming decades.
However,	statistics	often	fail	to	reflect	Africa’s	un-
derground	economies,	where	the	bulk	of	the	urban	
population	 works	 in	 the	 informal	 sector.	 In	 fact,	
many African cities that may appear as “a patch-
work	 of	 shantytowns,	 refugee	 camps,	 industrial	
zones and gated residential communities” are ac-
tually	clusters	of	economic	activities	that	are	linked	
through	 both	 formal	 and	 informal	 networks.	 One	
study  showed  that  in  the  years  1999  and  2000, 
the informal economy accounted for 42 per cent of 
23 African countries’ gross national product (GNP). 
Evidence  from  several  African  countries  has  also 
shown	that	the	informal	economy	keeps	growing	
even as the formal sector is stagnant. It is estimat-
ed,  for  instance,  that  informal  activities  account 
for 93 per cent of all new jobs and 61 per cent of 
urban employment in Africa. Although this largely 
invisible economy is not in a position to propel the 
continent out of poverty, it plays an important role 
in Africa’s urban transformation and development.

Quick Facts 

1.  The Millennium “slum target” has been 

achieved, improving the lives of 227 million 
people, but only because it was set too low at 
the outset; 100 million was only 10 per cent of 
the global slum population.

2.  China and India alone achieved the global slum 

target by improving the lives of 125 million 
slum dwellers.

3.  North Africa is the only sub-region in the 

developing world where both the number 
and proportion of slum dwellers have steadily 
declined.

4.  No single country has managed to halve 

their slum populations. The more successful 
(Indonesia, Morocco, Argentina, Colombia, 
Egypt, Dominican Republic) reduced slum 
incidence by 30 to nearly 50 per cent. 

Policy Points 

1.  The population of slum dwellers around the 

world continues to grow at around 10 per 
cent every year, intensifying the problem 
worldwide.

2.  Unless governments adopt ambitious, well-
devised targets for their own countries and 
allocate adequate budget resources, the 
lives of slum dwellers will effectively remain 
unchanged.

3.  Individual countries must revise and increase 

the slum target to take into account both 
existing and potential new slums. This is an 
essential building block if the urban divide is to 
be bridged.

4.  Countries and cities that take the slum target 

seriously are increasing the prospects for 
millions to escape poverty, disease and 
illiteracy, and simply to lead better lives. 

5.  Countries that have managed substantially to 
reduce their own slum populations give hope 
to others and show that adequate policies can 
bring positive change. 

6.  Improving the lives of slum dwellers is the best 
way to achieve all the Millennium Development 
Goals. Improving housing conditions and 
providing for water and sanitation will not only 
save lives among the very poor, but will also 
support progress in education and health.

but numbers are growing

good news on the slum target, 
Millennium Development goal 7

The living conditions of slum dwellers have made 

bleak news for years, shedding the crudest - and 
cruelest  -  light  on  the  urban  divide.  In  2006, 
UN-HABITAT  reported  that  thousands  of 
people were joining the ranks of the slum population every 
month in the towns and cities of developing countries, where 
one in every three residents already lived in a slum.1 Along 
with new data on the global slum population, UN-HABITAT 
presented a “worst-case” slum scenario, in which growth rates 
were  projected  to  continue  unabated  with  the  number  of 
residents rising from nearly one billion in 2005 to 1.4 billion 
by 2020.2 

At  the  time,  the  data  put  the  urban  divide  under  sharp 
focus and sparked fresh interest in slums. The outcome was 
a  series  of  reports  and  publications  predicting  increasingly 
desperate  situations  for  the  world’s  slum  dwellers.  Since 
the growth in urban populations in developing countries is 
often characterized by informality, illegality and unplanned 
settlements, and is, above all, strongly associated with urban 
poverty,  many  authors  assumed  that  urban  growth  in  the 
poorest countries would be synonymous with slum growth. 
Fortunately,  though,  a  number  of  countries  have,  to  a 
significant extent, managed to curb the further expansion of 
slums and to improve the living conditions prevailing there. 
This suggests that the world can reduce the urban divide and 
steer away from the worst-case scenario for urban growth. 

Since the year 2000, when the international community 
committed to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) 
and associated targets, the global effort to narrow the starkest, 
slum-related form of urban divide has yielded some positive 
results.  United  Nations  data  suggests  that  the  overarching 
goal of reducing absolute poverty by half can be achieved, 
although higher food prices in the last year may push 100 
million people deeper into poverty.3 When, under Goal 7, 
target 11 (as the slum target was originally known), member 
states  pledged  significantly  to  improve  the  lives  of  at  least 
100  million  slum  dwellers  by  2020,  they  could  not  have 
known that the target would be achieved 10 years ahead of 
schedule.4

According to UN-HABITAT estimates, between the year 
2000 and 2010 a total 227 million people in the developing 
world will have moved out of slum conditions. In other words, 
governments  have  collectively  exceeded  the  Millennium 
target by at least 2.2 times. 

Not  only  have  slum  dwellers  experienced  significant 
improvements  in  their  day-to-day  lives,  but  millions  have 
also  ceased  being  slum  dwellers  under  the  UN-HABITAT 
definition  (see  Box  below).  Another  reason  to  rejoice  is 
that  all  regions  in  the  developing  world  have  contributed 
to this success, even though some countries have been more 
successful than others.

While the world has reason to celebrate this welcome overall 
dent in the urban divide, there is no room for complacency. 
More than 200 million slum dwellers do enjoy better living 
conditions today than they did 10 years ago, but their absolute 
number in the developing world is not on the decline, quite 
the contrary: the number of slum dwellers in the developing 
world  has  risen  from  767  million  in  the  year  2000  to  an 
estimated  828  million  in  2010  (see Table  and  Map  1.3.1). 
This  means  that  61  million  new  slum  dwellers  have  been 
added  to  the  global  urban  population  since  the  year  2000. 
Current UN-HABITAT estimates confirm that the progress 
made on the slum target has not been enough to counter the 
growth of informal settlements in the developing world. In 
this  sense,  efforts  to  reduce  the  number  of  slum  dwellers  - 
and the urban divide at its most unacceptable - are neither 
satisfactory  nor  adequate,  especially  when  considering  that 
50.6 per cent of the world’s population - or 3.49 billion - now 
live in urban areas.5 

regional Trends

Many countries and regions have narrowed the urban divide 
through  significant  reductions  in  both  the  numbers  and 
proportions  of  slum  dwellers,  but  some  are  lagging  behind 
or,  worse,  are  actually  regressing.  As  shown  in  Map  1.3.2, 
Asia  was  at  the  forefront  of  successful  efforts  to  reach  the 
Millennium slum target between the year 2000 and 2010, with 
governments in the region improving the lives of an estimated 
172 million slum dwellers; these represent 75 per cent of the 
total number of urban residents in the world who no longer 
suffer from inadequate housing. The greatest advances in this 
region  were  recorded  in  Southern  and  Eastern  Asia,  where 
145 million people moved out of the “slum dweller” category 
(73 million and 72 million, respectively); this represented a 

24 per cent decrease in the total urban population living in 
slums in the two sub-regions. Countries in South-Eastern Asia 
have also made significant progress with improved conditions 
for  33  million  slum  residents,  or  a  22  per  cent  decrease. 
Only Western Asia has failed to make a contribution as the 
number of slum dwellers in the sub-region  increased by 12 
million. This setback can largely be attributed to the conflict-
related deterioration of living conditions in Iraq, where the 
proportion of urban residents living in slum conditions has 
tripled from 17 per cent in the year 2000 (2.9 million) to an 
estimated 53 per cent in 2010 (10.7 million).

Across  Africa,  the  lives  of  24  million  slum  dwellers  have 
improved in the last decade, representing 11 per cent of the 
global  effort  to  narrow  this  form  of  urban  divide.  North 
Africa  has  made  significant  gains  (see  Map  1.3.3),  with 
improved conditions for 8.7 million. In sub-Saharan Africa, 
though,  the  proportion  of  the  urban  population  living  in 
slums has decreased by only 5 per cent (or 17 million); as for 
the future, data suggest persistent challenges as growth rates 
remain high for both urban and slum populations (estimated 
at slightly less than 4 per cent on an annual basis). Every year, 
10 million more people are added to the urban population 
of sub-Saharan Africa; approximately one-third of these, or 3 
million, move to “formal” urban areas and act both as agents 
and  beneficiaries  of  formal  urban  and  economic  growth. 
The  remaining  two-thirds,  or  7  million,  live  in  informal 
settlements or slum conditions. Of these, only 2 million can 
expect to lift themselves out of the slum conditions where the 
other 5 million will remain confined on the wrong side of the 
urban divide. 

Some 13 per cent of the progress made towards the global 
Millennium slum target has occurred in Latin America and 
the Caribbean, where 30 million people have moved out of 
slum conditions since the year 2000. In proportional terms, 
the  reduction  is  19.5  per  cent.    This  leaves  Latin  America 
lagging behind North Africa for improved slum conditions, 
while remaining far ahead of sub-Saharan Africa, where the 
slum-induced urban divide remains stark (Map 1.3.4). 

On a global scale, the overall outlook is cause for optimism. 
The fact that an additional 227 million urban dwellers have 
gained  access  to  improved  water  and  sanitation  as  well  as 
to  durable  and  less  crowded  housing  shows  that  a  number 
of  countries  and  cities  are  taking  the  slum  target  seriously. 
This enhances the prospects for millions of people to escape 
poverty, disease and illiteracy, and to lead better lives thanks to 
a narrower urban divide. 

Un-hABITAT SlUM InDICATorS
A slum household consists of one or a group of individuals living under 
the	same	roof	in	an	urban	area,	lacking	one	or	more	of	the	following	
five	 amenities:	 (1)	 durable	 housing	 (a	 permanent	 structure	 providing	
protection	from	extreme	climatic	conditions);	(2)	sufficient	living	area	
(no more than three people sharing a room); (3) access to improved 
water	(water	that	is	sufficient,	affordable	and	can	be	obtained	without	
extreme effort); (4) access to improved sanitation facilities (a private 

toilet,  or  a  public  one  shared  with  a  reasonable  number  of  people); 
and  (5)  secure  tenure  (de  facto  or  de  jure  secure  tenure  status  and 
protection  against  forced  eviction).  Since  information  on  secure 
tenure is not available for most countries included in the UN-HABITAT 
database,	however,	only	the	first	four	indicators	are	used	to	define	slum	
households, and then to estimate the proportion of the urban population 
living in slums.

No  universal  pattern  of  shelter  deprivations  or 
types of slums emerges clearly, and there is no 
universal prescription for slum improvement. Still, 
when  rapid  urban  growth  does  not  come  with 
basic urban infrastructure, slums expand and the 
urban divide widens.

Contrary to “cities with slums” where the divide 
between rich and poor is quite clear, in “slum cit-
ies”	the	two	categories	live	side	by	side.	They	lack	
at least one element of adequate shelter, on top 
of	environmental	hazards	like	excessive	pollution	
and	lack	of	solid	waste	management,	among	oth-
ers. They are typically located in countries where 
poverty is endemic, urban infrastructure is absent, 
and housing is inadequate overall.

Slum cities are prevalent throughout sub-Saharan 
Africa. In Central African Republic, Chad and Ethio-
pia, slum cities are entrenched, with as many as 
91 per cent of even non-slum households living in 

extremely deprived settlements. The same situa-
tion prevails in Niger, Nigeria, Tanzania and Togo. 
The	lack	of	basic	services	is	to	be	attributed	largely	
to  inadequate  planning,  construction  and  social 
services,	leaving	cities	at	risk	of	becoming	more	
deeply  mired  in  pollution,  disease  and  social  ills. 
Rapid urban growth without a proportional increase 
in basic urban infrastructure can only widen the ur-
ban divide, as it leads to further slum expansion.

A  high  concentration  of  slum  households  also 
characterizes the urban areas of Southern Asia, 
owing	to	lack	of	housing	as	well	as	widespread	
poverty  and  instability.  In  Bangladesh,  endemic 
poverty is such that 71 per cent of urban house-
holds	lack	durable	housing,	sufficient	living	area	
or improved sanitation. In India, 44 per cent of all 
urban	households	are	classified	as	slums,	and	16	
per	cent	of	households	lack	improved	sanitation.	
In	 Afghanistan,	 Pakistan	 and	 Sri	 Lanka,	 political	

instability	 and	 conflict	 have	 deteriorated	 basic	
service provision and shelter conditions in cities, 
resulting in a high prevalence of slums. 

The same holds in Iraq and Lebanon, with refu-
gees  and  displaced  persons  compounding  the 
situation.  Elsewhere  in  Western  Asia,  Yemen 
features  the  highest  proportion  of  people  living 
below the national poverty line, at 41 per cent; 
65	per	cent	of	households	are	classified	as	slum	
dwellers, and 26.4 per cent suffer from multiple 
shelter deprivations. 

In  Latin  America  and  the  Caribbean,  Guatemala, 
Haiti,  Nicaragua  and  Bolivia  feature  the  highest 
proportions of slum households. In Haiti and Bolivia, 
more than half of these suffer from multiple shelter 
deprivations, with slum prevalence rates of 76 per 
cent and 61 per cent, respectively. In both coun-
tries,	lack	of	sanitation	and	sufficient	living	area	are	
the most widespread shelter deprivations.

MDg Progress in Individual Countries 

Some  countries  have  made  substantial  progress  and  are 
clearly  moving  ahead  not  only  in  slum  reduction  but  also 
in slum prevention. In absolute numbers, China and India 
have  improved  the  lives  of  more  slum  dwellers  than  any 
other country, having together lifted no less than 125 million 
people  out  of  slum  conditions  between  the  year  2000  and 
2010 (estimate) (see Figure 1.3.1).

In  this  resolute  effort  to  bridge  the  urban  divide  over 
the  past  decade,  China  has  recorded  the  most  spectacular 
progress  in  the  world,  with  improvements  to  the  day-to-
day  conditions  of  65.3  million  urban  residents  who  were 
living  with  one  or  more  factors  of  shelter  deprivation.  In 
proportional terms, China’s urban slum population fell from 
37.3 per cent in the year 2000 to an estimated 28.2 per cent 
in  2010,  a  25  per  cent  relative  decrease  (see  Figure  1.3.2). 
Although  disparities  have  grown  with  the  country’s  rapid 
economic  growth,  China  has  managed  to  improve  living

conditions  through  economic  reforms  and  modernization 
policies  that  have  used  urbanization  as  a  propelling  force 
of national growth. Pro-growth policies, with targeted pro-
poor  dimensions,  have  generally  resulted  in  a  reduction  in 
the  number  of  slum  dwellings.  More  significantly,  targeted 
programmes directed at old villages within the boundaries of 
expanding cities and newly developed slums (which provide 
cheap housing for the more than 8 million migrant workers 
who flock to the cities every year) have mixed both regulation 
and development mechanisms to prompt modernization - and 
have met success. A particularly successful strategy has been 
facilitating access of slum dwellers to more than 20 million 
new and affordable housing units through government equity 
grants  (as  a  mortgage  instrument).  These  procure  leases  on 
cheap  housing  built  by  property  developers,  who  are  given 
preferential tax rates as an incentive for the development of 
affordable homes. On top of this, a new tier of self-governance 
seems to also have emerged in the new housing estates, with 
residents electing committees to oversee and manage urban 
safety and security, environmental conservation and the needs 
of young and elderly people.6 

Like  China,  India  has  been  successful  in  improving  the 
lives of slum dwellers, having helped 59.7 million of these 
out of dire conditions since the year 2000. Slum prevalence 
fell  from  41.5  per  cent  in  2000  to  an  estimated  28.1  per 
cent  in  2010,  a  relative  decrease  of  32  per  cent.  India  has 
taken up urban poverty alleviation and slum improvement 
as important components of its urban development policies 
through four specific strategies: (1) enhancing the productivity 
of the urban poor by building skills and providing access to 
micro-credit; (2) improving the living conditions of the poor 
through provision of basic services and in-situ development 
of slum settlements; (3) providing security of tenure to poor 
families  living  in  unauthorized  settlements  and  improving 
their  access  to  serviced  low-cost  housing  and  subsidized 
housing  finance;  and  (4)  empowering  the  urban  poor 
through  community  development  and  encouraging  their 
participation in decision-making.7

After China and India, the most significant improvements 
in slum conditions in Asia were recorded in Indonesia, Viet 
Nam and Turkey. In South-East Asia, Indonesia improved the 
lives of 21.2 million slum dwellers, a 33 per cent proportional 
decrease (from 34.4 per cent of the urban population in the 
year 2000 to an estimated 23 per cent in 2010). Turkey scored 
as the best-performing country in Western Asia, reducing its 
proportion of slum households by slightly less than one-third, 
from 17.9 per cent in the year 2000 to an estimated 12.4 per 
cent in 2010. Another country that managed to narrow the 
urban divide was Viet Nam, where slum incidence dropped 
from 48.8 per cent in the year 2000 to an estimated 33.7 per 
cent in 2010 - a 30.9 per cent decrease. This is commensurate 
with poverty reduction over the same period,8 and it is worth 
noting here that Viet Nam has also made significant progress 
on most of the other Millennium Development Goals. 

The  more  successful  developing  countries  are  found  in 
North  Africa.  Egypt,  Morocco  and  Tunisia  have  achieved 
the most substantial reductions in the proportions of people 
living with shelter deprivations. In Morocco, an estimated 2.4 
million people moved out of slum conditions over the past 10 
years, reflecting a 45.8 per cent reduction in slum prevalence 
between the year 2000 (24.2 per cent) and 2010 (an estimated 
13 per cent), thanks to strong political leadership, clear targets 
and adequate budget resources.  Egypt reduced its proportion 
of slum dwellers by 39 per cent, as slum prevalence fell from 
28.1 per cent of the urban population in the year 2000 to an 
estimated  17.1  per  cent  in  2010,  in  the  process  improving 
living  conditions  for  five  million  people.  Such  significant 
narrowing of the urban divide in Morocco and Egypt alone 
accounted for two-thirds of North Africa’s progress. 

Among other major regions of the world, Latin America 
and  the  Caribbean  has  made  relatively  good  progress  on 
the  slum  target.  However,  aggregate  figures  conceal  the 
region’s heterogeneity. Argentina, Colombia and Dominican 
Republic, the most successful countries in the region, were 
able to reduce their proportions of slum dwellers in the last 

decade by over a third. Haiti, Mexico, Nicaragua, Guatemala 
and  Peru  achieved  reductions  ranging  from  21  to  27  per 
cent. Brazil managed to reduce its slum population by 16 per 
cent. Other countries in the region have been less successful, 
achieving  only  negligible  progress  toward  the  Millennium 
target and a narrower urban divide. 

Latin America’s four most populated countries - Argentina, 
Colombia,  Mexico  and  Brazil  -  account  for  79  per  cent  of 
the  region’s  estimated  improvements  in  the  lives  of  slum 
dwellers.  Among  these,  Argentina  and  Colombia  have 
proved the more successful, reducing by two-fifths their slum 
population  thanks  to  improved  housing  and  better  access 
to  water  and  sanitation.  As  it  emerged  from  the  economic 
crisis of the late 1990s and early 2000s, Argentina managed 
to improve the lives of nearly five million people residing in 
slum neighbourhoods, significantly reducing the prevalence 
of invasiones (as slums are known locally). In Colombia, an 
estimated 3.7 million slum dwellers have benefited from well-
targeted slum upgrading and prevention strategies, lowering 
slum prevalence from 22.3 per cent in the year 2000 to an 
estimated 13.5 per cent in 2010. Mexico made fair progress 
with  improved  conditions  for  five  million  slum  dwellers 
in  the  last  decades,  as  slum  prevalence  dropped  from  19.9 
per cent in the year 2000 to an estimated 14.4 per cent in 
2010.  Brazil, the world’s 10th largest economy, was able to 
improve the living conditions of an estimated 10.4 million 
people between the year 2000 and 2010, as slum incidence 
regressed from 31.5 to 26.4 per cent. The main factors behind 
Brazil’s success include economic and social policies that have 
improved incomes for poor urban households; a decreasing 
population growth rate and slowing rural-urban migration; 
the development of low-income housing policies that subsidize 
construction material costs, sites and services, and provide for 
slum  upgrading  and  land  tenure  regularization;  new  social 
housing  and  urban  infrastructure  projects;  the  creation  of 
a  Ministry  of  Cities;  and  the  adoption  of  a  constitutional 
amendment safeguarding citizens’ right to housing.9

ford public services. Efforts must also ensure that 
durable, properly sized land and housing is affordable 
and accessible to poor families so that they can also 
afford  health  care,  education  and  other  essential 
services. 

Slums are often viewed as the result of poor man-
agement of demographic growth on the part of 
major cities, but cities of all sizes struggle with 
the inability to provide adequate affordable land 
and housing and the extended water supplies and 
sanitation  facilities  needed  to  serve  expanding 
populations.  Slums  can  be  easier  to  improve  in 
smaller than in larger cities, as small cities often 
feature fewer social, cultural and economic barri-
ers to urban development. In small cities, develop-
ing master plans and engaging in urban planning 
with the participation of families and communities 
is often more straightforward than in large cities, 
and institutions can be more easily coordinated to 
implement services. In cities of all sizes, improv-
ing the lives of slum dwellers and bridging the ur-
ban divide depends on increased development of 
non-agricultural  sectors,  services  and  industries 
for sustainable urbanization, providing access to 
well-paid  jobs,  formal  land  and  housing  policies 
as well as structured credit. 

Planning	 for	 growth	 can	 be	 particularly	 difficult	
where  “cities”  are  actually  just  agglomerations 
of contiguous settlements that feature the same 
densities as those of more typical urban areas, but 
are administered independently. Such fragmented 
urban  areas  may  not  provide  the  infrastructure 
and	economic	activities	that	make	cities	liveable	
and viable. In some places, even areas where ru-
ral	activities	are	predominant	can	be	classified	as	
“cities” the moment they meet certain population 
thresholds. In Mali and Madagascar, for example, 
any place with a population of 5,000 inhabitants or 
more	qualifies	as	“urban”.	The	reclassification	of	
a location from rural area to “city” or “town” can 
imply the presence of administrative institutions, 
such as a city council in charge of planning, land 
allocation  and  provision  of  basic  services;  how-
ever, development of such much-needed ameni-
ties as sewerage systems and housing schemes 
to  ensure  access  to  adequate  dwellings  often 
does not follow, leaving small cities and towns as 
deprived as villages or rural communities. Clearly, 
creating  “urban”  places  without  adequate  infra-
structure for the resident population densities is a 
recipe for slum cities.

The  prevalence  of  slum  households  varies  dra-
matically across cities of the developing world. In 
some, a relatively small percentage of households 
experience shelter deprivations, or many experi-
ence  only  one  barrier  to  adequate  housing.  In 
other cities, a majority of households live in dwell-
ings	that	lack	two	or	more	basic	shelter	ameni-
ties, threatening the health, safety and well-being 
of residents. 

Slums in the cities of many sub-Saharan African 
countries have become notorious for the extent 
and  intensity  of  their  deprivations,  and  yet  liv-
ing	conditions	for	people	in	housing	classified	as	
“slums” are not uniformly alarming. Indeed, the di-
vide between slums and more conventional urban 
environments seems so narrow as to be relatively 
easy to bridge - if	only	policymakers	recognized	
the opportunity and acted accordingly. Indeed, in 
a number of sub-Saharan African cities, some of 
the living conditions that prompted concern in the 
past are undergoing noteworthy improvement; in 
some places, slum households now are only one 
or two basic amenities short of “adequate” hous-
ing.	In	Southern	Africa,	countries	like	Namibia	and	
Zimbabwe feature the relatively low slum concen-
trations that can also be observed in middle-in-
come countries of Asia and Latin America and the 
Caribbean.  In  the  Southern  Africa  sub-region,  it

or sanitation to help many families out of slums, 
enabling them fully to enjoy urban life with all their 
basic shelter needs met. In South Africa, for ex-
ample, 3 out of 10 urban homes are “slum house-
holds”, and as many as 22 per cent of households 
suffer from only one shelter deprivation - primarily 
lack	of	improved	sanitation	(10	per	cent)	or	of	suf-
ficient	living	area	(9	per	cent).	

Because no universal pattern of shelter depriva-
tions or types of slums is evident across the cit-
ies of the developing world, there is no universal 
prescription  for  slum  improvement.  In  all  of  the 
cities where the urban landscape is dominated by 
slums,	improving	the	lives	of	slum	dwellers	first	
requires the implementation of macro-economic 
programmes  that  can  lift  households  from  de-
privation to adequate living standards, providing 
for  the  missing  elements  in  their  environments: 
housing	 infrastructure	 and	 finance,	 improved	
water,  improved  sanitation,  or  durable  housing 
units with adequate living space. However, these 
macro-level  programmes  must  be  associated 
with micro-level schemes, including micro-credit, 
self-help,  education  and  employment.  Housing 
services  may  be  available,  but  families  will  use 
them only if they are affordable. Moreover, urban 
infrastructure  projects,  when  focused  on  slum 
upgrading, should include economic development 
and employment programmes if families are to af-

Slum target reached, but the numbers keep growing

The year 2010 marks the halfway point towards the deadline 
for the “slum target”. In their efforts to improve the lives of 
at least 100 million slum dwellers by 2020, the governments 
of  the  world  have  already  collectively  exceeded  the  target 
by  more  than  two  times.  Part  2  of  this  Report  shows  how 
improvements in housing can also have an impact on access 
to health, education and job opportunities for those living in 
slum neighbourhoods. 

Over  the  past  10  years,  the  proportion  of  the  urban 
population  living  in  slums  in  the  developing  world  has 
declined from 39 per cent in the year 2000 to an estimated 
32  per  cent  in  2010.  And  yet  the  urban  divide  still  exists, 
because in absolute terms the numbers of slum dwellers have 
actually grown considerably, and will continue to rise in the 
near future. Therefore, the fact that the world as a whole has 
reached the Millennium slum target 10 years in advance does 
not mean that efforts to improve the lives of slum dwellers 
should slow down or altogether stop. Rather, the fact that the 
target was reached this early makes it quite clear that it was 
simply set too low. 

In the developing world between the year 2000 and 2010, 
the  urban  population  is  estimated  to  have  increased  by  an 
average of 58 million per year. During the same period, the 
absolute number of slum dwellers is reckoned to have increased 
by  nearly  half  this  number  (28  million)  every  year.  UN-
HABITAT estimates that in developing countries, 22 million 
people have been lifted out of slum conditions every year over 
that decade, through slum upgrading or prevention.

This means that an average of 6 million people became slum 
dwellers every year. These estimations show that nearly half of 
the urban growth in the developing world can be attributed to 
slum expansion (48 per cent) and a significant proportion of 
it is improved over time (38 per cent), but still about 10 per 
cent of this informal growth remains in deprived conditions 
every year.

Simple  projections  extrapolating  data  from  the  previous 
decade show that by 2020, and short of drastic action to curb 
current  trends,  the  slum  population  worldwide  is  likely  to 
grow annually by 6 million every year, or another 61 million 
people, to reach a total of 889 million by 2020.

New  slum  estimates  presented  in  Table  1.3.1  show  that 
today, nearly a third (32.7 per cent) of the urban population in 
developing regions live in the inadequate housing conditions 
that  are  a  major  aspect  of  the  urban  divide.  In  particular, 
the  projections  for  slum  reduction  in  sub-Saharan  Africa, 
where  approximately  61.7  per  cent  of  urban  residents  are 
slum  dwellers,  are  as  not  as  optimistic  as  for  other  regions 
of  the  world.  The  precarious  nature  of  the  development 
pathway of sub-Saharan Africa appears clearly in a number 
of trends that have to do not just with slums but also with 
other development and urban divide indicators such as infant 
and maternal mortality, employment and hunger. Despite the 
efforts of some countries and cities to expand basic services 
and improve housing conditions in slum areas, inaction by 
others has prevented overall progress from keeping pace with 
a rapidly increasing urban population. In the past decade, the 
number of urban residents in the sub-region increased by some 
100 million, slightly more than half (55 million) of whom 
were new slum dwellers, while another 16 million moved from 
the “slum dweller” to the “urban non-slum resident” category. 
This means that while the proportion of the urban population 
living in slums underwent a moderate reduction (from 65 per 
cent in the year 2000 to an estimated 61.7 per cent in 2010), 
the actual slum population increased in absolute numbers by 
five million every year. The data provides no evidence that this 
pattern, and the urban divide that comes with it, will change, 
and it is likely that nearly half of the growth in sub-Saharan 
Africa’s urban population will take place against a background 
of poverty and deprivation between now and 2020. 

In  Benin,  Ethiopia,  Malawi  and  other  countries  that 
rank among the lowest on the Human Development Index 
compiled  by  the  United  Nations  Development  Programme 
(UNDP),  slum  prevalence  is  expected  to  remain  at  a  very 
high 70 per cent. The future is not looking bright for conflict-
affected  countries  in  sub-Saharan  Africa,  either:  in  Central 
African  Republic  and  Côte  d’Ivoire,  the  proportion  of 
slum dwellers has increased by around one-tenth. The most 
conspicuous case of slum population increase was observed in 
Zimbabwe, with a surge (from 3.3 to 17.9 per cent) resulting 
from massive forced evictions in 2005. These have added to 
the numbers of people living in overcrowded conditions, and 
a  deteriorating  economy  has  also  had  severe  effects  on  the 
country’s urban poor. 

BOx 1.3.3: WoMEN BEaR THE BRUNT oF PRoBlEMS aSSociaTED WiTH SlUM liFE 

The  vast  Kibera  settlement  in  Nairobi  receives 
much  media  attention  as  one  of  the  largest, 
most  densely  populated  slums  in  Africa,  but 
there are surprisingly few comprehensive studies 
with	reliable	statistics	relating	specifically	to	the	
women who live there. Much of the documentation 
about women in Kibera is based on case studies, 
interviews and qualitative analysis. 

Kibera is a vast slum located approximately seven 
kilometres	southwest	of	Nairobi’s	city	centre.	A	
large concentration of women live there in what 
can easily be described as the worst conditions 
slums  have  to  offer.  The  slum  is  characterized 
by  severe  poverty,  poor  access  to  clean  water, 
overflowing	open	sewers,	huge	heaps	of	rubbish,	
overly crowded mud houses, constant threat of 
eviction, and widespread criminality, delinquency 
and unemployment.

Although men in Kibera also suffer from problems 
associated with slum life, numerous studies on 
informal settlements in the region suggest that 
women  bear  the  brunt  of  problems  brought  on 
by  inadequate  housing  and  insecure  tenure. 
Unequal  power 
relations  between  women 
and  men  generally  leave  Kibera  women  at  a 
disadvantage  in  areas  such  as  accessing  land, 
property  and  other  productive  resources,  and 
securing	remunerated	work.	

Indeed, research by the Centre on Housing Rights 
and  Evictions  (COHRE)  found  that:  “Informal 
settlements  in  Nairobi  are  …  often  home  to 
thousands  of  women  who  were  driven  by  in-
laws out of their rural and urban homes and land 
upon the death of their husbands. In two separate 
missions to Kenya, as well as through research on 
women’s inheritance rights in sub-Saharan Africa, 
COHRE found that family pressure, social stigma, 
physical  threats  and  often  extreme  violence 
directed  at  the  widow  force  her  to  seek  shelter 
elsewhere.” 

The	 study	 reinforces	 findings	 from	 numerous	
others  showing  that  widows  are  particularly 
vulnerable to eviction because of customary and 
traditional  practices  in  sub-Saharan  Africa  that 
override  international  commitments,  such  as 
the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination  Against  Women.  Such  practices 
often compromise the rights of Kenyan widows to 
keep	their	land	and	housing	when	disputes	with	
in-laws  arise.  Property  grabbing  from  widows 
whose  husbands  have  died  of  AIDS  is  also 
reportedly widespread and is one of the factors 
that push women to migrate to Kibera.

Because  of  their  low  incomes,  these  women 
have  few  housing  alternatives  when  or  if  they 
are  evicted.  There  is  also  some  evidence  to 
suggest  that  single,  unmarried  mothers 
in 
informal  settlements  such  as  Kibera  have  the 
poorest  choice  in  housing  since  many  landlords 
are unwilling to rent to them, believing them to be 
unreliable tenants. 

The burden of women’s domestic roles in Kibera 
also  puts  them  at  more  of  a  disadvantage 
when	 basic	 services	 like	 water,	 sanitation	 and	
electricity	 are	 lacking.	 Like	 women	 in	 many	
parts  of  the  developing  world,  those  in  Kibera 
are  usually  responsible  for  water  collection  and 
management of waste in the home. Long queues 
of women waiting with rows of yellow jerrycans 
are a common sight in the slum. Up to 85 per cent 
of women in Kibera draw water from private and 
community-owned	water	kiosks.

As in other slums where sanitation facilities are 
poor or non-existent, going to the toilet at night 
or in the early morning is a considerable security 
concern for women. Because they have to venture 
down narrow, unlit alleyways, many would rather 
use	 a	 plastic	 bag	 (the	 so-called	 “flying	 toilets”)	
rather	than	braving	the	dark	and	the	inherent	risk	
of rape and sexual harassment. 

Compared	 with	 men,	 who	 are	 more	 likely	 to	
secure	 work	 outside	 the	 slum,	 women	 spend	
more	time	around	the	home	and	are	more	likely	

than	 males	 to	 take	 care	 of	 household	 waste.	
In  doing  so,  they  are  exposed  to  environmental 
hazards  such  as  breathing  in  harmful  fumes 
from  the  burning  of  rubbish,  which  add  to  the 
health	 risks	 they	 already	 experience	 by	 cooking	
indoors	with	charcoal,	kerosene	or	firewood	in	the	
absence of electricity or cheaper fuel.

Even	 if	 women	 do	 not	 get	 sick	 themselves,	
their unpaid labour when caring for people with 
diarrhoea	(leading	killer	of	children	under	5	-	and	
malaria,	 both	 of	 which	 are	 exacerbated	 by	 lack	
of	 improved	 sewerage)	 takes	 time	 away	 from	
education or income-generating activities.

The Kenya Water for Health Organization estimates 
that the average household in Kibera comprises 
seven  people,  and 
that  many  households 
are  female-headed.  A  10-by-10  square  foot 
dwelling for seven people is indicative of severe 
overcrowding  and  its  attendant  problems,  such 
as	lack	of	privacy,	ease	of	disease	transmission	
- especially respiratory infections - and increased 
risk	of	“negative	social	behaviour	patterns”,	such	
as domestic violence and child abuse. The cycle 
of violence continues outside the home as well: 
poverty often pushes girls in slums to engage in 
risky	sexual	behaviour	or	prostitution	in	exchange	
for food, shelter, gifts, or cash. As a result, HIV 
infection in the slum remains extraordinarily high, 
with estimates as high as 20 per cent - more than 
twice the national average.

North Africa is the only sub-region in the developing world 
where both the number and the proportion of slum dwellers 
have  been  steadily  declining  since  the  year  2000.  Despite 
an urban growth rate of 2.4 per cent10 (or an additional 2.2 
million urban dwellers every year) over the past decade, the 
share of slum dwellers in the sub-region fell from 20 per cent 
to an estimated 13.3 per cent over the same period, or about 
2.9 million in absolute numbers. This substantial reduction 
in the urban divide can be attributed to effective government 
policies for slum upgrading and prevention. 

Asian cities are host to an estimated 61 per cent of all the 
slum dwellers in the developing world. In Southern Asia, the 
poorest sub-region, more than one-third (35 per cent) of the 
urban population experiences at least one shelter deprivation 
as  defined  by  UN-HABITAT.  The  sub-region  also  features 
the  highest  incidences  of  infant  mortality  and  other  social 
problems in Asia.11 Fifty-three per cent of the slum dwellers 
in Southern Asia, or 103 million people, are concentrated in 
India, the most populated country in the sub-region. Despite 
India’s substantial reduction in slum prevalence, projections 
are that the slum population in Southern Asia will still grow 
by some half million per year, totaling 200 million by 2020. 
This is even more likely as economic growth rates are slightly 
declining in India.12 In Bangladesh, slum prevalence remains 
very high at 70 per cent. Regional spillovers from the global 
financial crisis are also likely to cut into government revenues 
and concomitant abilities to invest in the delivery of housing 
and basic services that are essential to narrowing the urban 
divide.

South-Eastern  Asia  features  the  second-highest  rate  of 
slum prevalence in the region (an estimated 31 per cent in 
2010). For all the achievements of countries like Indonesia, 
Viet Nam and, to some extent, the Philippines, where slum 
growth  has  decelerated  significantly,  other  social  indicators 
such as maternal mortality remain unacceptably high13 in the 
sub-region as a whole. This is primarily a result of conditions 
prevailing in Cambodia, Lao People’s Democratic Republic 
and Myanmar, where slum prevalence is high and development 
indicators point to low quality of life. Improvements in the 
lives of slum dwellers take longer in South-Eastern Asia; by 
current  trends  and  short  of  drastic  action,  the  number  of 
residents  in  slum  areas  is  to  grow  by  slightly  more  than  2 
million every year, reaching 109 million by 2020. It is also 
likely that urban poverty, and the urban divide, will increase 
in  some  of  the  South-Eastern  Asian  emerging  economies 
that  have  been  severely  affected  by  the  collapse  in  demand 
for consumer durable goods and the deterioration of global 
financial  conditions;  both  of  these  could  result  in  more 
victims of shelter deprivations in the coming years. 

In  Eastern  Asia,  28.2  per  cent  of  the  urban  population 
dwell in slums. More than 90 per cent of Eastern Asia’s slum 
dwellers,  or  171  million,  live  in  China.  In  fact,  China  is 
home to a full one-fifth of the world’s slum population - the 
same as the country’s share in the global population. Thanks 
to  China’s  own  significant  achievements,  Eastern  Asia  as  a 
whole  has  reduced  slum  incidence  by  an  estimated  25  per 

cent.  However,  in  view  of  ongoing  rapid  urban  growth,  it 
is anticipated that the number of slum dwellers in the sub-
region will continue to increase by a total 30 million over the 
next  10  years,  reaching  219  million  by  2020.  In  countries 
with liberalized open economies and a high dependence on 
external demand, such as Korea, unemployment and poverty 
may increase as a result of the global financial crisis, making 
the conditions of those already living with shelter deprivations 
even worse. 

The proportion of slum dwellers in Western Asia should 
be relatively low by 2010, at an estimated 24.6 per cent of 
the urban population. In terms of slum prevention, however, 
the sub-region has made little progress, owing to deteriorating 
living  conditions  in  Iraq,  Lebanon  and  Jordan.  The  slum 
population in the sub-region has grown by more than half 
since  the  year  2000  (from  23  million  to  36  million),  as  a 
consequence of ongoing political turmoil, a related increase 
in the refugee population, and disruptions in the delivery of 
basic services and housing. The implications of the region’s 
instability are also evident in other Millennium Development 
Goal indicators, such as the high proportion of underweight 
children under 5 and the high maternal mortality rate - two 
indicators  on  which  Western  Asia  has  made  little  progress 
compared  with  other  developing  regions.14  Against  this 
background, Turkey stands out for having reduced by slightly 
less  than  one-third  its  slum  population  and  improved  the 
lives of nearly 3.5 million people over the last 10 years; no 
other  country  has  contributed  more  to  MDG  compliance 
in Western Asia. Turkey has achieved this by systematically 
legitimizing self-built housing, allowing for in-situ upgrading, 
and providing public transport and basic service infrastructure 
to informal settlements in the largest cities. In recent years, 
however,  forced  evictions  and  “urban  renewal”  strategies  in 
some  Turkish  cities  have  replaced  informal  housing  with 
large-scale  estates  that  have  resulted  in  the  displacement 
of  the  poorest  residents.15  If  the  Western  Asia  sub-region 
remains engulfed in conflicts and various forms of instability, 
it is likely that the existing urban divide, as reflected in high 
numbers of slum dwellers, will be there to stay, growing by 
around 24 million to reach 48 million in the next 20 years. 

Latin America and the Caribbean experienced a significant 
(20 per cent) reduction in the proportion of slum dwellers 
in its urban population over the last decade. However, slum 
incidence remains relatively high: 23 out of 100 urban residents 
in the region live in tugurios, favelas or campamentos, as the 
precarious settlements are locally known. The region is quite 
heterogeneous  in  terms  of  human  development  indicators 
and slum incidence. Haiti, the poorest country in the region 
and one of the poorest in the world, has a slum prevalence 
of 70 per cent. Bolivia and Nicaragua similarly feature very 
high slum prevalence, with nearly every other urban resident 
living  in  informal  neighbourhoods  that  lack  one  or  more 
basic  services.  Approximately  one-third  of  the  total  urban 
population in Peru and Guatemala live in slums, compared 
with roughly one-quarter in Argentina and Brazil. Elsewhere 
in the region, slum incidence is low in Colombia, Dominican

Republic and Mexico, with less than 15 per cent of the urban 
population living in slums; the lowest proportions are found 
in  Chile  and  several  Caribbean  countries,  where  the  urban 
divide is less pronounced.

Latin  America  exhibits  the  greatest  inequalities  in  the 
distribution of welfare and wealth in the developing world. 
However,  between  2002  and  2006,  the  region  achieved 
significant social and economic progress. Generally speaking, 
poverty  and  unemployment  have  been  reduced;  in  some 
countries,  income  gaps  have  narrowed  and  job  numbers 
increased, underlying the current positive trend in the region. 
According to the Economic Commission for Latin America 
and the Caribbean, poverty decreased by more than 4 per cent 
between 2002 and 2006.16 The current global financial crisis 
and the 2008 food crisis may reverse some of these trends, 
and  could  particularly  affect  health  and  education  services 
for  the  very  poor.  The  potential  effect  on  slum  indicators 

and the urban divide is difficult to estimate, but the trends 
of the past two decades suggest that the slum population in 
Latin America and the Caribbean will, like Southern Asia’s, 
continue to grow by half a million people every year, reaching 
120 million by 2020. 

Slums: The need for a higher goal and a more 
realistic target

Because  of  the  many  cross-currents  behind  urban, 
demographic  and  policy  realities,  another  172  million 
people  have  become  slum  dwellers  even  as,  10  years  ahead 
of  the  2020  deadline,  the  world  collectively  exceeded  by  a 
wide  margin  the  100  million  reduction  target  set  under 
Millennium Development Goal 7, target 11. The number of 
urban residents living in slum conditions is now estimated at 
some 828 million.

in Brazil, India and Mexico have done. Civil 
society organizations can also encourage political 
commitment and champion the views and 
rights of slum dwellers and the poor in general 
-	either	as	watchdogs	like	Réseau Social Watch 
Bénin that monitor Millennium Development 
Goals and poverty reduction strategies, or as 
partners	in	government-funded	programmes,	like	
Mexico’s Hábitat y Rescate de Espacios Públicos 
(Reappropriation of public space). Organizations 
like	Shack/Slum	Dwellers	International	on	
occasion perform both an advocacy and an 
executing role. 

Long-term political commitment. Over the 
past 15 years, consistent political commitment 
to large-scale slum upgrading and service 
provision to the urban poor has enabled China, 
India,	Turkey,	Dominican	Republic,	Colombia,	
Egypt, Morocco and Tunisia to reduce and 
stabilize slums. Other countries, including Ghana, 
Senegal and Argentina have fairly recently 
stepped up action, and yet others have begun 
to gather the necessary political support for land 
and	tenure	policy	reforms,	including	Burkina	
Faso, Senegal and Tanzania. 

Policy reform and institutional 
strengthening. The policy reforms required 
for slum upgrading and prevention involve 
housing, land and infrastructure provision and 
finance.	Indonesia,	Nicaragua	and	Peru	have	
integrated large numbers of urban poor into 
the	legal	and	social	fabric;	other	countries,	like	
India, have deployed major pro-poor reforms 
and programmes for land and housing provision 
or are adopting more inclusive approaches. 
Costa	Rica,	Ecuador	and	Colombia	look	to	avoid	
relocations	and	instead	work	on	settlements	in 
situ, improving existing living conditions. Most 
of the more successful countries - including 
Indonesia, Iran, Mexico, Philippines, South Africa 
and	Turkey	-	look	beyond	the	housing	sector	
and	fight	slums	as	part	of	broader-ranging	urban	
poverty reduction strategies. Policies have tended 
to shift from entitlement to co-participation, 
where	financial	viability	and	down-payments	
condition access to public subsidies for both new 
housing and improvements. Creation of a Human 
Settlements Ministry gives higher visibility and 
continuity to the cause as demonstrated in 
Burkina	Faso.	Municipal	decentralization	through	
community-based consultation mechanisms is 
another avenue that has succeeded in Cambodia, 
Malawi and Zambia.

Implementation and monitoring. Countries 
that performed well on the Millennium slum 
target (including Indonesia and South Korea) 
deployed transparent and pro-poor policies 
backed	up	by	adequate	human	and	technical	
resources. Others, such as Colombia, Chile, 
the Philippines and South Africa, also trained 
urban planning and management professionals 
and involved them in housing and basic 
service delivery programmes. The most 
successful countries (China, Viet Nam, Chile, 
Sri	Lanka	and	Peru)	coordinated	slum	policy	
implementation between central regional and 
municipal authorities and the private sector. 
Other countries set themselves national targets: 
Cambodia (100 slum communities upgraded 
every year); Chile, Brazil, Morocco and Thailand 
(all of which enacted clear slum targets and 
benchmarks	as	part	of	urban	poverty	reduction).	
Indonesia uses results-based monitoring and 
satisfaction surveys. 

Scaling-up. Replication and scaling-up of 
successful, local one-off or pilot slum-upgrading 
projects have served Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, 
South	Africa,	Sri	Lanka	and	Indonesia	well	with	
measurable impacts on national indicators 
of slum growth. As originally modest-scale 
programmes were upgraded in Brazil, Egypt, 
Nicaragua	and	Turkey,	the	private	sector	and	
civil society became involved, or the schemes 
benefited	from	additional	funding	for	replication	
and mainstreaming into government policies.  In 
Burkina	Faso	and	Senegal,	reforms	started	in	the	
1980s in the capital city and expanded into large-
scale physical and tenure upgrading schemes 
for irregular settlements across the country. 
Other countries, including China, Chile and South 
Africa, engaged in large-scale public subsidies to 
the housing sector, in a bid to reach the poorest 
groups and meet the rising costs of social 
housing. In most cases, success mobilized huge 
domestic (and, on occasion, external) resources 
to promote innovative strategies, including for 
slum prevention. 

Policy analysis shows that on top of a 
combination	of	these	five	elements,	success	
on the Millennium slum target involves proper 
coordination between cohesive, well-designed 
and adequately resourced centralized 
interventions on the one hand, and local 
authorities on the other hand.

Slums have only on occasion proved to be what 
most public authorities wished they would: a 
transient phenomenon, which growth and higher 
incomes would eliminate over time. In too many 
cities today, all-too visible slums remain blind 
spots	for	policymakers	-	caught	as	they	are	
between	token	gestures,	clearance	or	mass	
eviction,	or	administrative	“pass	the	buck”.	The	
odd attempt at institutional response and reform 
typically	founders	on	lack	of	support,	funding	or	
coordination. Still, municipalities in a number of 
countries (representing about one-third of those 
known	as	“developing”)	have	managed	to	reduce	
the absolute and relative numbers of slum-
dwellers among their populations. 

How did they do it? The successful 
governments	took	the	responsibility	for	slum	
reduction	squarely	on	their	shoulders,	backing	
commitments with bold policy reforms, and 
preventing future slum growth with equitable 
planning and economic policies. Recent 
policy evidence collected by UN-HABITAT in 
44 successful countries suggests that slum 
reduction	takes	a	combination	of	five	specific,	
complementary approaches: (1) awareness and 
advocacy; (2) long-term political commitment; 
(3) policy reforms and institutional strengthening; 
(4) implementation and monitoring; (5) and 
scaling-up of successful local projects. 

Awareness and advocacy. For local 
authorities	and	other	stakeholders,	awareness	
requires slum monitoring systems and indicators 
to	collect	information	and	analyse	trends,	like	
those that have been successful throughout Viet 
Nam, Brazil and Indonesia. Advocacy involves 
disseminating messages on improved living 
conditions for slum dwellers, as governments

When 

international  community  adopted 
implicitly  endorsed 

the 
Millennium  Declaration  and 
the 
“Cities without Slums” target in the year 2000,17 experts in 
development agencies thought that 100 million was both a 
significant number and a realistic target within 20 years. By 
2003, though, when UN-HABITAT - the agency in charge 
of  monitoring  the  “Cities  without  Slums”  target  -  made  a 
first estimate of the global slum population, it appeared that 
100 million represented only about 10 per cent of that total, 
which in 2001 stood at over 900 million. 

Even  if  the  Millennium  target  was  low  and  somehow 
poorly  defined,  as  it  failed  to  specify  what  a  “significant 
improvement” in the lives of slum dwellers would entail, it 
was welcome at the time insofar as it provided the set figure 
and deadline that had been missing in the Habitat Agenda 
(1996).  The  Millennium  Declaration  also  came  as  the  first 
clear commitment by the international community to address 
an explicitly urban issue, in the process raising the profile of 
cities and slums on the global agenda. 

In  2003,  UN-HABITAT,  together  with  expert  groups, 
developed  a  set  of  five  indicators  of  deprivation  (see  Box 
p.33)  in  order  to  monitor  and  measure  improvement  in 
slum  conditions.  Unfortunately,  unlike  other  Millennium 
Development  Goals,  the  slum  target  was  not  set  as  a 
proportion, such as halving the proportion of people living on 
less than one US dollar a day, or reducing by two-thirds the 
under-5 mortality rates18 with reference to a specific baseline 
(in this case, the year 1990). Instead, the slum target was set 
as an absolute number, and for the world as a whole. This 
makes it difficult, if not outright impossible, to set country-
specific targets. A more effective alternative could have been, 
for instance, for every country to halve the proportion of slum 
dwellers in the urban population between the year 2000 and 
2020. As the target stands, instead, governments do not know 
the  numbers  of  slum  dwellers  whose  conditions  they  must 
improve as part of the global target of 100 million. Clearly, 
this target has diluted responsibilities and hindered a number 
of governments from making serious commitments. Further 
adding to the unambitious nature of the target is its extended 
2020  deadline,  instead  of  2015  for  all  other  Millennium 
Development Goals.

Looking  ahead  to  2020,  there  is  no  question  that  the 
world  has  proved  that  it  can  collectively  achieve  a  slum 
target  that  will  narrow  the  urban  divide  by  making  a  real 
difference to urban populations. Without any doubt, urban 
poverty and slums can be reduced, and the urban divide with 
them. Governments and local authorities know what to do. 
However,  success  requires  a  collective,  medium-term  effort 
on the part of all member States. Even though the target was 
low and easily achievable, progress has been made in various 
countries. From a practical as well as a symbolic point of view, 
this first achievement is eminently meaningful for all those

involved.  From  a  practical  perspective,  the  success  of  the 
better-performing countries gives hope for others; it conveys 
a clear message that positive results are within reach. It shows 
that for those countries lagging far behind, this is the time 
for action. It is time to define a reasonable target, formulate 
appropriate policies, set up strategies and procedures that are 
clear, concise and easy to follow, and to dedicate significant 
financial and human resources to effective results. 

From a symbolic point of view, the success of some countries 
is showing the world that it is possible to reduce urban poverty. 
It is also showing which countries are honouring their pledge 
to meet the slum target and which are failing to “keep the 
promise” - a promise that is not only about numbers, but, 
more importantly, about people: the 828 million people living 
in deprived housing conditions, without improved water or 
adequate  sanitation,  often  in  dilapidated  dwellings  without 
sufficient living space or secure tenure. 

The  current  global  financial  climate  poses  a  risk  that 
some  advances  in  slum  upgrading  and  prevention  may  be 
reversed. Another risk is that some gains can be undone by 
government  inaction  or  poor  responses  that  do  not  take 
population  growth  into  account.  Progress  in  improving 
the  lives  of  slum  dwellers  will  depend  largely  on  the  way 
governments address slums as part of the broader agenda of 
reducing urban poverty and inequality. 

The world has another 10 years to make further progress on 
the slum reduction target by the 2020 deadline. Governments 
must recognize that 100 million slum dwellers was a minimum 
threshold, not a ceiling. Together they must revise and raise 
the target to a number that takes into account both existing 
and potential new slums. This is an essential building block if 
the urban divide is to be bridged, if only over time.

Countries  that  have  been  performing  well  so  far  must 
maintain or increase efforts to improve the living conditions 
of  slum  dwellers,  while  providing  adequate  alternatives  to 
prevent  new  slum  formation.  Those  governments  that  are 
falling behind in slum reduction must bring radical changes 
to  their  attitudes  and  policies  vis-à-vis  slums  and  urban 
poverty at large.19

In  this  respect,  a  multi-pronged  policy  response  to  the 
persistent challenge of slums is a key target in its own right, 
and one that has the potential to influence the achievement 
of other Millennium Development Goals. Improving housing 
conditions  and  providing  for  water  and  sanitation  will  not 
only save lives among the very poor, but it will also support 
progress in education and health. This first step out of poverty 
will be another, major one across the urban divide.

Policymakers  around  the  world  must  bridge  the  urban 
divide at the regional, national, local and city levels, Policies 
must focus on those countries and regions facing the greatest 
development  challenges  in  slum  reduction:  sub-Saharan 
Africa and Western Asia. Other areas and countries in need of 
special attention are those which, for all their overall progress 
toward the slum target at the national level, are still faced with 
huge spatial inequalities in some regions and cities. Finally, 
policies must also focus on those cities which, although they 
are doing relatively well, still feature large pockets of poverty 
where people remain marginalized. It is increasingly apparent 
that failure to set and meet a more ambitious slum target will 
jeopardize the achievement of other MDGs.20 Only political 
will,  adequate  policies  and  the  right  technical  choices  can 
effectively tackle slums, which represent the most unacceptable 
face of the urban divide.

2.1

The Urban Divide
overview and Perspectives

Divided spaces and opportunities

Cities are more often than not divided by invisible 

borders. These split the “back” from the “front”; 
or the “higher” and “lower” areas, as the urban 
divide is known colloquially in many parts of 
the South. These man-made fractions often run along a spatial 
and social continuum, reflecting the only difference between 
their respective populations – socio-economic status.1 Closer 
assessment of the urban space in many cities of the developing 
world unambiguously exposes the fragmentation of society, 
with clear differences in the way space and opportunities are 
produced,  appropriated,  transformed  and  used.  Some  areas 
feature  significant  infrastructure,  well-kept  parks,  gardens 
and up-market residential areas. In contrast, other areas are 
characterized  by  severe  deprivation,  inadequate  housing, 
deficient  services,  poor  recreation  and  cultural  facilities, 
urban decay and scarce capital expenditures. These tangible 
differences  in  access  come  as  symptoms  of  the  intangible, 
yet  enduring  divisions  in  society  that  apportion  unequal 
opportunities and liberties across all urban residents.

In diverse urban landscapes, sharp contrasts abound across 
neighbouring  streets,  buildings,  public  spaces,  gardens, 
markets or offices. In places, these urban components merge 
and blend into one another; in others, they are separated by 
walls, doors, symbolic features or geographic factors such as 
topography,  rivers  or  lakes.  Whether  differentiated  spaces 
are contiguous or separated, they add to any social gaps and 
deepen divisions across the city. 

Cities as diverse as Nairobi, Buenos Aires, Johannesburg, 
Mexico and Rio de Janeiro are similar in that pockets of wealth 
and poverty co-exist in close proximity, sometimes just one 
or two blocks from one another. In Mumbai, a city of stark 
contrasts, skyscrapers face makeshift roadside settlements and 
the largest slums in Asia. In other cities, wealth and poverty 
are  more  clearly  demarcated.  For  instance,  in  the  northern 
neighbourhoods of Quito, poverty affects fewer than 2 per 
cent of the population, while in the barrios to the south, the 
proportion is close to 95 per cent.2 Examples such as these 
highlight  the  large  disparities  between  better-off  minorities 
and the many poor, which are also reflected in different degrees 

Quick Facts 

1.  Fragmentation of society is reflected in clear 

differences in the way space and opportunities 
are produced, appropriated, transformed and 
used.

2.  Economic and social exclusion typically results 

in cultural and political exclusion.

3.  A divided city exacerbates inequalities 

and contributes to the stratification of the 
population into a social hierarchy marked by 
exclusion; ethnic minorities are often finding 
themselves in the same category as the poor 
and unempowered. 

4.  Further partitioning the city are divisive factors 
like fear, anxiety and insecurity that contribute 
to partitioning further the city.

Policy Points 

1.  Inclusive policies for cities should 

acknowledge the dynamics of the urban divide 
and support informal business institutional 
arrangements as well as affordable delivery of 
land and housing.

2.  Residents can gradually realize their individual 

city rights through access to better services, 
including health and education, jobs and 
opportunities. Freedom of expression, equal 
opportunities for business development, 
recognition of cultural rights and adequate 
housing are all equally important.

3.  Strategies for inclusiveness must be based on 
a clear and cogent representation of the way 
the four dimensions of equality – economic, 
social, political and cultural – can be integrated 
concurrently into the day-to-day lives of the 
population.

4.  The “right to the city” encapsulates the four 

dimensions of equality, which, combined, will 
guarantee inclusiveness.

of access to cultural facilities, public goods, transportation and 
open spaces in most cities in the developing world. 

Social  segregation  also  transpires  in  economic  statistics, 
with sharp differences in incomes across neighbourhoods and 
districts within one and the same city. For instance, in one of 
the wealthiest neighbourhoods in Buenos Aires, average per 
capita  income  is  1,400  pesos  (or  US  $370),  or  three  times 
the average 371 pesos earned by the poorer residents. Such 
disparities are also reflected in land values in the Argentinean 
capital: the cost of one square metre in the rich neighbourhood 
is 116 per cent higher than in the poorer one.3

Amartya Sen has amply demonstrated that it is incumbent on 
development strategies to pool and mobilize skills and abilities 
across the whole spectrum of society. This is the reason that 
the urban divide as a concept cannot be defined exclusively 
in terms of fragmented space and socio-economic disparities. 
Since a sustainable city requires engagement with all segments 
of the resident population, the social divide must also be taken 
to involve the unequal opportunities across social categories, 
age groups and gender regarding such resources as access to 
knowledge,  technology  and  gainful  employment  that  may 
hinder such effective engagement. Large sections of society are 
frequently excluded on grounds of predetermined attributes 
over which they have no control at all (such as gender, race, 
ethnicity, age) or little control such as where they live (slums 
vs.  rich  neighbourhoods)  or  what  they  own  (income  and 
social status); however, this narrow perspective overlooks the 
actual  and  potential  contributions  of  marginalized  groups 
to building cities and nations, and therefore can only delay 
progress toward sustainable and inclusive development. 

Various  forms  of  exclusion  continue  to  marginalize  vast 
amounts of human capital that is only waiting to be mobilized 
for the sake of sustainable cities. In New Delhi, for example, 
52 per cent of men were employed in 2006, as opposed to 
only 9.4 per cent of women.4 Likewise in the same year, 82 
per cent of the total labour force in Chittagong was male and 

only  18  per  cent  female.5  In  many  cities  of  the  developing 
world, women are less educated than men; but even where 
women have achieved higher education levels, their income-
generating capabilities remain the same as, or even inferior to, 
those of men. For instance, in the metropolitan area of San 
José, Costa Rica, women earn, on average, 20 per cent less 
than men, despite the fact that they have a higher proportion 
of college degrees.6 

These divisions are reinforced by spatial and socio-economic 
differences  within  a  city,  illustrating  the  various  degrees  of 
access made available by private-sector suppliers of goods and 
services. From Port-au-Prince to Ibadan to Nairobi to Dhaka, 
erratic power supply affects poor neighbourhoods more than 
affluent areas. Blackouts, lack of adequate transportation and 
inferior educational and health facilities for the urban poor are 
all clear symptoms of a divided city, where middle-class and 
rich households are better served simply because they can pay 
or they have the capacity to negotiate the provision of services 
and facilities for their specific neighbourhoods. In many cities, 
public facilities predominantly used by the poor are described 
as  overcrowded  and  badly  managed  by  poorly  paid  and 
unmotivated  staff,  combining  waste  of  resources  with  little 
focus on results. In contrast, privately owned and managed 
schools, universities and health centres generally feature better 
equipment, more qualified staff and more advanced facilities 
that can only be afforded by the middle and upper classes. 
In Mumbai, for instance, half of slum neighbourhoods have 
no  primary  schools.7  In  Port-au-Prince,  the  disparity  in 
enrollment rates at primary level is significant: 59 per cent of 
children from poor households are enrolled, as opposed to 79 
per cent of those from better-off households.8 Such tangible 
divisions in one and the same city create new social lines of 
divide  and  reinforce  those  already  separating  the  privileged 
from  the  disadvantaged;  this  is  the  case  in  Port-au-Prince, 
with its separate schools for the gran nèg, or the rich, and for 
the malheureux, or the underprivileged.

Social and cultural divides

The divide has inter-generational consequences for society

Social  divisions  can  permeate 

interactions  amongst 
individuals even in the absence of significant ethnic, racial or 
other factors of segregation. Fresh divisions constantly emerge 
and  become  entrenched;  patterns  of  social  inclusion  or 
exclusion preserve benefits for specific social segments based 
on their physical location, shared interests or other criteria.

More often than not, economic and social exclusion result 
in  cultural  and  political  exclusion  as  well.  On  top  of  the 
features mentioned above, a divided city is also one that fails 
to accommodate poorer residents, regardless of the cultural 
richness  they  might  lend  to  the  city  as  a  whole.  Hip-hop 
groups in cities throughout Africa and the Americas, samba 
schools in São Paulo and tribus urbanas in Quito, for example, 
represent vital aspects of youth culture, but they remain on 
the margins of society, typically creating messages about, and 
communicating only with, members of their own self-selected 
groups.  Though  their  voices  may  communicate  important 
truths about the cultural realities of large populations in cities, 
such groups often remain excluded from, and marginalized 
by, the urban mainstream. 

Urban segmentation can also result from institutionalized 
divisions of space and social belonging, such as the specific 
form  of  citizenship  formalized  in  China’s  “Houku”,  or 
certificate of urban residence. At the other end of the range 
of divisive factors are the intangible feelings of fear, anxiety 
and insecurity that contribute to partitioning Rio de Janeiro 
into safe and “no-go areas”, or that designate zones de droit 
and  non-droit  in  Port-au-Prince,  or  those  that  signal  “no-
law neighbourhoods” in Mexico City. The urban divide not 
only  generates  stigma,  but  to  some  extent  also  feeds  on  it. 
In  cities  in  Asia,  Africa  or  Latin  America,  some  spaces  are 
known for what they lack, as in the “barrios sin domicilios”, or 
neighbourhoods  without  addresses.  Symbolic  dividing  lines 
can also refer to the history of a city: the “flooded district”, or 
the “burnt area”, often conspicuously devoid of the amenities 
and resources common to less damaged areas.

It 

Slums are the face of a divided city. The divisive nature of 
any city finds its graphical reflection in numbers such as the 
proportion of slum dwellers to the overall population, or the 
degrees of deprivation in slums. In some places (“cities with 
slums”), informal settlements are located in one part of the 
city, with the better-off neighbourhoods in another. In that 
sense, a certain degree of homogeneity can be found in the 
residential areas of an otherwise heterogeneous city. A good 
example of this is Greater Mumbai, where the slum population 
in the western suburbs is as high as 43 per cent, whereas in the 
city proper it is only 17 per cent. A similar pattern features 
in New Delhi District, where 3.4 per cent of the population 
lives  below  the  poverty  line,  whereas  in  the  North  West 
District, this proportion is more than 30 per cent.9 A slum 
area is typically associated with reduced numbers of schools, 
clinics and other public and private amenities. In La Paz for 
instance, mothers from slum areas are three times more likely 
not to receive prenatal professional care than those from non-
slum areas. This shows quite clearly that in a vital area like 
reproductive health, unequal access to services can have fatal 
consequences for mothers and children in a divided city: in 
Bolivia’s capital in 2005, the probability of dying before the 
age of 5 for slum-born children was 1.38 times higher than 
for those born in non-slum areas.10 

low 

that 

therefore, 

is  apparent, 

incomes  and 
multidimensional deprivations increase risks and exacerbate 
the overall vulnerability of the poor. The partitioning of urban 
and social space not only derives from the historical partition 
of  wealth  and  poverty,  but  is  also  a  result  of  pronounced, 
enduring  intergenerational  inequities.  Indeed,  children  of 
impoverished parents face a broad range of risks: malnutrition, 
lack of educational opportunities and resources, and greater 
incidence  of  diseases  than  their  better-off  counterparts, 
coupled  with  lower  access  to  proper  health  care  and  lower 
life expectancy. Underprivileged children are also faced with 
unequal opportunities when it comes to the social and cultural 
expression of their specific identities, aspirations and feelings 
within society. They are frequently relegated to the second or 
third ranks in the urban hierarchy of tangible and intangible 
amenities or benefits. For instance in Bogotá, up to one-third 
of the housing stock in the underprivileged municipality of 
Usme  is  located  in  environmentally  hazardous  areas.11  In 
Nairobi, more than 200 informal settlements housing more 
than  half  the  population  are  crammed  into  a  tight  space 
that represents only 5 per cent of the city’s residential land. 
Similarly in Dhaka, 34 per cent of available space is planned 
for allocation to 4.4 million upper- and middle-income people 
outside  the  city  centre,  compared  with  only  4  per  cent  for 
4.5 million low-income residents. This uneven distribution of 
space, and the associated poverty, interfere with the exercise 
of equal rights within the city – the primary reason being that 
a substantial portion of the population is faced with restricted 
access to employment and income, on top of other obstacles 
to the development of their abilities and their opportunities 
to live a better life.

A  divided  city  not  only  exacerbates  inequalities,  it  also 
contributes to the stratification of the population into a social 
hierarchy marked by exclusion. In the Peruvian city of Oruro, 
the Andean population – Quechua-speaking, predominantly 
female and illiterate, and with a high probability of becoming 
parents  in  adolescence  –  is  systematically  excluded  and 
marginalized.  In  Jaipur,  India,  the  “Schedule  Casts”  and 
“Schedule  Tribes”  that  represented  only  12.5  and  3.4  per 
cent, respectively, of the city’s residents in 2008, accounted 
for as much as 53 per cent of the overall slum population.12 
Undoubtedly, the high concentration of socially marginalized 
groups  among  slum  residents  is  an  indicator  of  the  urban 
divide in any city. Ethnic minorities are finding themselves, 
more often than not, in the same category as the poor and 
unempowered. In the metropolitan region of São Paulo, 4.4 
per cent of the population over 15 years was illiterate in 2004. 
From this universe, illiteracy among the white population was 
only 3.4 per cent, compared with 6.6 per cent among the black 
or brown population. In a gender perspective, male illiteracy 
among  the  white  population  was  2.5  per  cent,  compared 
with 4.1 per cent for females; in contrast, among the black or 
brown, 5.7 per cent of males were illiterate compared with 7.4 
percent for females. It is worth noting that because of unequal 
access to higher education, in the same year 20 per cent of 
whites had college degrees, as opposed to only 5.9 per cent of 
blacks or browns.13 

Inclusive cities: A positive approach to the urban divide

The urban divide involves a range of negative factors that 
are  an  integral  part  of  the  transformative  process  cities  are 
undergoing, especially in the developing world. Still, divided 
cities  should  not  necessarily  be  thought  of  as  a  negative 
phenomenon. This evolving, multi-dimensional process calls 
for a more nuanced understanding of city development. For 
example, slums play a fundamental role in capital formation 
in  cities  in  the  developing  world,  and  also  demonstrate 
substantial economic potential. In New Delhi, up to one-third 
of investment in housing is accounted for by slum dwellers.14 
Similarly, informal sector activities today contribute as much 
as  80  to  90  per  cent  of  all  new  job  opportunities  in  Latin 
America.15  A  positive  development  strategy  calls  for  the 
transformation of informal activities in order to create more 
productive enterprise clusters.

The urban divide also incidentally creates human capital in 
the form of social and cultural practices and arrangements that 
allow people to save money, share resources, build businesses 
and create opportunities in mutually beneficial ways. These 
include initiatives such as community social funds, music and 
art groups that provide education and cultural expression, as 
well as informal institutional mechanisms that promote service 
delivery to the marginalized. Recognition and promotion of 
the  economic  potential  of  slums,  or  of  social  and  cultural

initiatives that reflect the creativity of society, require a holistic 
approach – one that enables all segments of the population to 
participate in the economic growth and prosperity of cities 
in a collective effort to promote long-term, sustainable urban 
development. 

An inclusive city, as defined for the purposes of this report, 
is one that provides all residents – regardless of race, ethnicity, 
gender  or  socio-economic  status  –  with  adequate  housing 
and  decent  basic  services,  and  facilitates  equal  access  to 
social amenities, opportunities and other public goods that 
are essential to the general and environmental well-being of 
everyone (social inclusion). 

An  inclusive  city  upholds  citizens’  rights  and  liberties, 
and promotes social and political participation for the sake 
of  better-informed  and  more  democratic  decision-making 
(political inclusion).

An inclusive city is one that fosters economic development 
by  way  of  equal  opportunities  for  business  and  access  to 
employment,  and  promotes  pro-poor  economic  policies 
(economic inclusion). 

An inclusive city promotes social integration and celebrates 
diversity.  It  values  people’s  cultural  rights,  recognizing  the 
human capital of all segments of society, which it strives to 
enhance  through  promotion  of  creative  artistic  expression 
and heritage activities (cultural inclusion).

In  this  definition,  residents’  environmental  rights  come 
under  the  dimensions  of  social  and  cultural  equality,  since 
they  address  the  intergenerational  aspects  of  individuals’ 
rights to live in safe and sound environments.

Against this background, municipal efforts to design and 
implement strategies for inclusiveness must be based on a clear 
and  cogent  representation  of  the  way  the  four  dimensions 
of  equality  –  economic,  social,  political  and  cultural  –  can 
be  integrated  concurrently  into  the  day-to-day  lives  of  the 
population.  Residents  can  gradually  realize  their  individual 
city  rights  through  access  to  better  services,  including 
health  and  education,  jobs  and  opportunities.  Freedom  of 
expression,  equal  opportunities  for  business  development, 
recognition  of  cultural  rights  and  adequate  housing  are  all 
equally important. Cities are the places where partnerships can 
be forged, constructive debates can be held, and negotiation 
and consensus can take place in a collective effort to promote 
development.16

local 
governments  to  build  new  relationships  and  alliances  with 
central and state/provincial authorities. Inclusive policies for 
cities should acknowledge the dynamics of the urban divide; 
in  this  respect,  they  should  focus  more  particularly  on  any 
positive  components  that  could  be  integrated  to  formal 
municipal norms and practices, such as the informal economy, 
social  capital  and 
institutional  arrangements, 
including affordable land delivery and housing systems, etc. 
Only  through  explicit  and  deliberately  inclusive  schemes 
and  procedures  will  it  be  possible  to  identify  the  locally 
appropriate, innovative and high-leverage actions and policies 
which  government,  civil  service  and  major  institutions  can 
deploy  to  set  in  motion  self-reinforcing  processes  that  will 
overcome the urban divide.17

If  the  four  dimensions  of  equality  –  social,  political, 
economic  and  cultural  –  are  to  be  turned  from  a  mere 
conceptual paradigm into reality, they must be implemented 
within  a  rights-based  framework,  and  one  that  is  easy  to 
enforce. Short of this, the prevailing patterns of exclusionary 
development,  selected  benefit-sharing,  marginalization  and 
discrimination  will  continue  unabated  in  cities.  Moreover, 
entrenched types of socio-economic behaviour such as rent-
seeking and patronage will also persist unchecked (as would, 
more generally, any challenge to what is known to economists 
as “Pareto optimality”, through promotion of opportunities 
for a few at the expense of others). 

Such  a  rights-based  framework  is  predicated  upon  three 

requirements, though:
•	 Cities must develop a vision that integrates everyone. 
•	 Cities  must  put  forward  plans  and  implementation 
mechanisms  that  are  adequately  monitored  and  can  be 
revised depending on outcomes. 

•	 Cities  must  set  up  new  institutions,  or  improve  and 
strengthen existing ones, in order to ensure that they are 
inclusive, accountable and efficient. 

If met, these three requirements would, along with others, 
guarantee that a city provides the framework that integrates 
the  dreams,  aspirations,  freedoms  and  rights  of  its  entire 
population. 

The “right to the city” encapsulates the four dimensions of 
equality, which, combined, will guarantee inclusiveness. The 
fundamental principle of the right to the city is that human 
rights  are  interdependent  and  indivisible.  This  calls  for  the 
simultaneous achievement of all human rights for all residents 
in any city. This, in turn, means that all human rights – political, 
economic, social, and cultural – must receive equal priority in 
city governance, planning, management and implementation. 
The right to the city should also encompass the rights to self-
determination and freedom of assembly and organization, and 
the right to development (social, political, cultural, spiritual 
and economic), both individual and collective. Endorsement 
and implementation of a strong human rights-based approach, 
therefore, is the only way to preserve and uphold the dignity 
of all urban dwellers while addressing the multiple violations 
and problems which millions in cities around the world are 
facing today.

The  right  to  the  city  is  not  to  be  viewed  as  yet  another 
legal concept; rather, it represents a dynamic and pragmatic 
combination of the multiple human rights to which urban 
dwellers are entitled, and that they want fulfilled. The concept 

and implementation of the right to the city must be grounded 
in the basic, universally recognized human rights principles 
of non-discrimination, indivisibility, gender equality, gradual 
realization,  non-retrogression,  subsidiarity,  solidarity  and 
cooperation  (see  Chapter  3.1).  With  its  implicit  universal 
ambit  and  egalitarian  underpinning,  the  right  to  the  city 
suggests that special attention must be given to any individuals 
or groups – including gender – in a situation of vulnerability; 
the notion also strongly if tacitly subsumes responsibility and 
sustainability as core principles.

Cities for all in the developing world

An  inclusive  city,  as  defined  in  this  report,  addresses 
economic  as  well  as  social,  political  and  cultural  equality 
across  all  segments  of  society.  The  notion  of  inclusiveness 
as  comprising  these  four  dimensions  derives  from  Sen’s 
“capabilities”  perspective.18  This  perspective  stresses  how 
important it is to view economic opportunities in conjunction 
with  all  other  forms  of  political,  social  and  cultural  rights 
in societies that work together to build up “capable” social 
capital in developing countries. Only when the four forms of 
opportunities converge can they usher in optimal conditions 
for  production  of  the  human  capital  required  to  enable 
sustainable development.

BOx 2.1.1: Policy aNalySiS oN THE iNclUSivE ciTy: SURvEy METHoDology 

In 2009 UN-HABITAT conducted a policy assess-
ment on inclusive urban policies in 27 cities in the 
developing world: Africa (7 cities), Asia and Latin 
America and the Caribbean (10 cities each). The 
analysis was carried out by expert focus groups 
in every city. Each group was comprised of some 
15  experts  from  community  associations,  non-
governmental and other civil society groups, the 
media,	 lawyers,	 urban	 planners,	 municipal	 offi-
cials and the business sector. 

The	questionnaire	sent	out	to	the	27	city-specific	
focus	groups	took	in	the	four	dimensions	of	the	
“inclusive  city”,  including  the  local  institutional 
and  organizational  capacities  associated  with 
them.  The  assumption  behind  the  survey  was 
that the “right to the city” encapsulates the four 
dimensions  of  equality  which,  combined,  bring 
about inclusiveness.

To	 a	 significant	 extent,	 cities	 were	 selected	
based on availability of “hard” indicators (such 
as	Gini	coefficients,	gross	domestic	product	per	
capita,  labour  structure,  etc.);  in  a  next  step, 
this quantitative data was combined with quali-
tative information provided by individual expert 
groups  (for  their  perceptions  on  the  various 
variables).  Prior  to  the  focus  group  meeting, 
every	group	prepared	a	background	document	
for their respective city. These reports analyzed 
the laws, regulations, policies and actions that 
have	contributed	to	make	cities	more	inclusive,	
specifying	 which	 stakeholders	 had	 brought	
about the positive changes. This Report quotes 
from	 a	 number	 of	 these	 expert	 background	
papers	 in	 order	 better	 to	 reflect	 both	 percep-
tions of local realities, and understanding of the  
“inclusive city” concept. 

UN-HABITAT tested the basic assumption behind 
the survey against the expert group answers to the 
questionnaire. Descriptive statistical analysis was 
combined with econometric techniques in order 
to  understand  the  correlations  and  associations 
between  various  aspects  of  inclusion/exclusion 
and policy interventions. The econometric models 
informed  the  substantive  sections  of  Part  3 
(“Bridging the Urban Divide”) of this Report and 
guided policy analysis.  The results of the survey 
questionnaire were analyzed against UN-HABITAT 
quantitative	 data,	 the	 background	 reports	 from	
every city and other relevant information, in order 
to	 make	 sure	 that	 progress	 towards	 inclusive	
cities could be attributed to policy decisions and 
related  actions.  Additional  policy  research  was 
conducted through literature and Web searches, 
in  order  to  shed  more  light  on  the  causality  of 
policy changes.

2.2

The economic Divide
Urban Income Inequalities

global and city trends in 
income inequality

Any full understanding of an inclusive city requires 

a  multidimensional  assessment 
framework. 
Such  a  framework  must,  indeed,  account  for 
practical social, economic, political and cultural 
opportunities, as well as the interdependencies among them. 
A wide variety of measures is used to gauge the economic and 
social condition of the world’s cities, and the most frequently 
used measurements of the economic dimension of the urban 
divide are income and consumption inequalities.

Inequality  is  usually  measured  on  a  national  scale,  but 
attention  is  increasingly  paid  to  general  urban  and  city-
specific  inequalities.  As  a  further  step  in  the  research  into 
urban  inequalities  presented  by  UN-HABITAT  in  the 
previous  (2008/9)  edition  of  the  State  of  the World’s  Cities 
report,  this  chapter  identifies  and  measures  income  and 
consumption  inequalities  in  a  larger  sample  of  cities  from 
both developed and developing countries, based on updated 
data.  It  reviews  ongoing  trends  and  recent  changes  in  the 
urban divide as measured by economic inequality, including 
some of the causal factors. For the purposes of this report, 
UN-HABITAT  has  analyzed  Gini  coefficients  for  both 
income  and  consumption  at  the  general  urban  level,  and, 
where possible, for specific cities.

Two related cautionary points about UN-HABITAT data 
must  be  stressed  here.  First,  income  inequality  cannot  be 
mistaken  with  poverty:  notionally  at  least,  countries  can  be 
so broadly well-off, or poor, as to feature minimal inequality 
(see  below  under  “The  more  equal  cities”).  Second,  Table  1 
presents  groupings  of  countries  that  correspond  to  specific 
Gini coefficient brackets and that in no way whatsoever can 
be  understood  as  rankings.  The  import  of  these  groupings 
is  to  suggest  that  the  more  income  inequality,  the  higher 
the  potential  for  social  and,  ultimately,  political  tension. 
This  potential  is  mitigated  by  the  institutional  and  other 
arrangements  that  prevail  in  any  particular  location.  Such 
institutional  arrangements  (such  as  welfare)  typically  tend 
to  be  stronger  in  developed  than  in  developing  countries. 
Across  all  countries,  though,  a  broader  definition  of  these 
arrangements  also  includes  provision  of  services  such  as 
health  care,  education,  housing  and  basic  facilities,  etc.; 

Quick Facts 

1.  Economic development tends to go hand in 

hand with more equitable income distribution, 
except in Latin America (where income 
inequality is stark), Eastern Europe and CIS 
(where income inequality is low).

2.  In the developing world, the concentration 

of inequalities is higher in urban than in rural 
areas, except in Latin America. 

3.  The magnitude of urban economic inequality, 
or the severity of the economic divide, is not a 
function of city size.

4.  Overall the economic urban divide remains 

sharp; it is slightly decreasing in Latin America 
and is increasing moderately in Asia. Trends 
are mixed in Africa, and transition countries are 
becoming less egalitarian.

5.  The stark rich-poor divide is most noticeable 
in African and Latin American cities. In both 
regions, the gap is often extreme compared 
with cities in Asia, Eastern Europe and the CIS.

Policy Points 

1.  Whether economic growth results in broader 

distributions of incomes or consumption in 
urban areas is a matter for socioeconomic 
policy and structural reforms.

2.  In developing countries, the more unequal 

the distribution of income or consumption in 
urban areas, the higher the risk that economic 
disparities will result in social and political 
tension.

3.  Highly unequal income or consumption 

patterns in cities in the developing world point 
to institutional and structural failures, as well 
as to broader economic problems such as 
imbalanced labour markets or a lack of pro-
poor policies.

4.  Even when measured in strictly economic 

terms, inequality can point to several types of 
urban deprivation, such as lack of basic public 
services like water and sanitation, some of 
which are directly linked to the Millennium 
Development Goals.

access to these can be unequal within individual cities, with 
the potential of enhancing or mitigating equality as measured 
in pure economic terms. 

When  measured  in  terms  of  consumption  (household 
expenditures)  instead  of  income,  high  Gini  coefficients  also 
denote  unequal  access  to  basic  goods,  which  may  act  as  a 
hindrance  to  poverty  reduction  strategies  and  achievement 
of  Millennium  Development  Goals.  Consumption-based 
Gini coefficients are not immune from perverse effects and 
can reflect some type of deprivation instead of “more equal” 
access  to  urban  services.  For  instance,  poor  households  in 
slum settlements typically spend relatively high proportions 
of their low incomes on water when, for lack of alternatives, 
they  buy  it  from  street  vendors  at  a  multiple  of  the  prices 
charged by water distribution utilities. More generally, both 
income and consumption inequalities are linked to broader 
economic factors like labour markets, capital investment in 
public services, lack of pro-poor policies, etc. Further potential 
distorting factors originate with economic and other patterns. 
The  services  sector  features  a  very  wide  range  of  income 
levels, from the highest in any given city or economy to the 
lowest available in the formal sector (cleaning, catering, waste 
disposal).  The  informal  economy  similarly  features  a  broad 
range  of  incomes,  which  at  the  top  of  the  range  can  both 
be very substantial and go unreported for tax and statistical 
purposes. Corruption and fraud are two further, unreported 
distorting factors that are more likely to affect mid- to top-
range incomes. Finally, urban dwellers in the middle to top 
income  brackets  typically  tend  to  consume  more  imported 
products, including food, than those on low incomes. 

The economic urban divide across the 
world: An overview

Developed country cities: Inequality is relatively low 

In general terms, income inequalities in developed countries 
are low. Little is known, however, about inequalities at the 
urban  level,  as  available  data  is  generally  not  disaggregated 
to metropolitan areas or individual cities. The exceptions are 
Australia, Canada, Japan and the United States of America. 
Information  on  Gini  coefficients  in  developed,  highly 
urbanized nations is generally provided on a nationwide scale. 
Based on this data, national degrees of income inequality in 
developed countries range from a low Gini coefficient of 0.23 
in Denmark and Sweden to a high of 0.385 in Portugal. 

Very low degrees of inequality are found in countries with 
Gini values under 0.3, which is the average for 27 selected 
developed  nations  that  report  nationwide  Gini  values.  All 
countries in this category are European and include (in order 
of  ascending  Gini  values):  Denmark,  Sweden,  Luxemburg, 
Austria, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Finland, France, Belgium, 
The  Netherlands,  Switzerland,  Norway, 
Iceland  and 
Germany. The low degrees of inequality reflect the regulatory, 
distributive  and  redistributive  capacity  of  European  welfare 
states.1 Relatively low degrees of inequality that still exceed 
the sample average for developed countries (between 0.301 
and 0.385) are found in some other European countries such 
as Spain, Greece, Ireland, United Kingdom, Italy, Poland and 
Portugal (in ascending order), and also in Australia, Canada, 
Japan, New Zealand and the United States of America.

BOx 2.2.1: MEaSURiNg iNEqUaliTy: THE giNi iNDEx

The term “inequality” has many different mean-
ings. In this report, it is used primarily to de-
scribe how an indicator of economic well-being 
is distributed over a particular population. 

The  Gini  index  is  the  most  widely  used  sum-
mary  measure  of  inequality.  It  measures  the 
distribution  of  either  income  or  household 
consumption expenditures as a ratio between 
0 and 1, where 0 indicates perfect equality (a 
proportional distribution of resources), and 1 in-
dicates perfect inequality (where one individual 
has all of the income or other resources and no 
one else has any). 

Since income is split between consumption and 
savings, income-based are always higher than 
consumption-based	Gini	coefficients,	and	sav-
ings	accumulation,	or	lack	thereof,	is	a	major	

determinant of wealth or poverty. For instance, 
in	2003	the	Gini	coefficient	in	Addis	Ababa	was	
0.560  for  expenditure  and,  0.612  for  income. 
The	 Gini	 coefficient	 can	 also	 be	 used	 to	 esti-
mate other non-income inequalities, such as in 
health, education, assets and access to infra-
structure. 
The  meaning  of  the  Gini  index  can  be  under-
stood  in  terms  of  the  “income  gap”  created 
by unequal resource distribution. For example, 
when	the	Gini	coefficient	is	0.47	–	which	is	the	
case in the states of Alabama, Florida, Louisi-
ana, Mississippi, and Texas in the United States 
of America – it means roughly that the poorest 
20	per	cent	of	the	population	(the	fifth	quintile)	
earns 3 per cent of the total income, whereas 
the	wealthiest	20	per	cent	(first	quintile)	earns	
50 per cent of the total income. 

The measurement of household income and 
consumption inequalities is subject to differ-
ent approaches in different countries. Some 
countries – such as India, Mozambique and 
Togo – base their inequality estimations on 
household  expenditure  rather  than  income 
because  the  statisticians  responsible  for 
reporting  inequality  data  presume  that  sur-
vey  questions  about  consumption  patterns 
will produce more accurate results and less 
suspicion  than  those  about  earnings.  Other 
countries – such as South Africa, China and 
Brazil  –  base  their  inequality  estimates  on 
income  because  they  assume  that  house-
hold reluctance to disclose earnings will also 
extend	 to	 expenditure.	 Still	 others,	 like	 Sri	
Lanka,	assess	income	inequality	using	both	
income and expenditure. 

Sources: UN-HABITAT, Global Urban Observatory Database, 2009; Asian Development Bank, 2007. 

Altogether, income inequalities at national level in devel-
oped countries increased between the mid-1980s and 2005.2 
Growth in nationwide income inequality has been particu-
larly stark in Poland and Germany, both of which experienced 
increases of up to 17 and 10 per cent, respectively, between 
the year 2000 and 2005 – the most significant rises in income 
inequality  of  all  of  the  developed  countries  under  review. 
Computations based on OECD data3 for 25 developed na-
tions, however, show that the average Gini value changed by 
less than 1 per cent between the year 2000 and 2005. Some 
countries have even experienced a 4 to 7 per cent decline in 
Gini values in recent years, particularly the United Kingdom, 
Greece and Spain. 

From  a  policy  perspective,  analyzing  urban-level  Gini 
coefficients is fundamental to understanding and addressing 
urban  poverty.  Yet,  for  all  their  wealth  of  information  on 
urban  indicators  and  data,  developed  countries  typically 
do  not  report  city-specific  Gini  coefficients,  particularly  in 
Europe.    Those  that  are  available  for  specific  metropolitan 
areas  or  cities  suggest  that  nationwide  aggregates  do  not 
always accurately reflect disparities in general urban or city-
specific incomes. For example, the national Gini coefficient 
for Canada in the mid-1990s was 0.283, whereas the value for 
the country’s urban areas was 0.36, indicating a higher degree 
of inequality in cities than in rural areas. Likewise, Australia 
reported  a  national  Gini  coefficient  of  0.317  in  the  year 
2000, but the value for the major cities was slightly higher, 
at  0.332  in  2001.  The  most  surprising  variations  between 
national and city-specific Gini data are found in the United 
States of America, where around 2005 the national coefficient 
stood at 0.381, but exceeded 0.5 in many major metropolitan 
areas  including  Washington,  D.C.,  New  York  City,  Miami 

and others. These values are comparable to the average Gini 
coefficients  of  cities  in  selected  Latin  American  countries, 
where income inequality is particularly steep (see Map 2.2.1). 
When  comparing  national  aggregates  with  city-specific 
values,  it  is  clear  that  huge  variations  can  be  found  within 
one and the same country. Even in highly urbanized societies, 
national Gini coefficients conceal income inequalities at the 
sub-national level. 

Developing countries: Wide differences in income 
inequality in urban areas across regions and countries

Income  inequalities  are  generally  greater  in  developing 
than  in  developed  countries.  In  the  developing  world, 
disparities between urban and rural areas are often also quite 
stark; consequently, national and local Gini values must be 
disaggregated to provide an accurate picture of the disparities 
in  each  environment.  The  following  review  of  developing 
countries delves into general urban as opposed to city-specific 
inequalities. Whereas in developed nations, Gini coefficients 
are  based  only  on  income,  in  developing  countries  the 
calculations  are  based  either  on  income  or  consumption  
(see Box 2.2.1). 

The  overall  pattern  that  emerges  from  a  review  of  the 
expanded  UN-HABITAT  database  on  urban 
income 
inequalities in developing countries features values that differ 
significantly across regions, countries and cities, as well as a 
persistence of such differences over time. Table 2.2.1 illustrates 
the breadth of urban Gini coefficients based on income across 
selected  developing  countries.  Five  distinct  groups  emerge 
from  the  analysis,  ranging  from  “low”  to  “extremely  high” 
income inequality.

The developing world encompasses Africa, most of Asia, and 
Latin America and the Caribbean; the review in this chapter 
also includes those transition countries in Eastern Europe and 
the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) for which 
urban-level Gini coefficient data based on income is available. 
Since most of the countries in Asia and Africa base their Gini 
coefficient estimates on consumption instead of income, they 
are not included here. 

Low inequality: Countries in this bracket feature urban Gini 
coefficients  under  0.299.  Their  urban  areas  generally  feature 
broad provision of basic services and the social and redistribu-
tive policies that allow for an equitable income distribution. 
Only Eastern European and CIS countries exhibit low degrees 
of urban income inequality, likely owing in part to the influ-
ence of their former Socialist regimes with their strong social 
institutions, safety nets and strict controls on wages. Belarus is 
where urban income inequality is at its lowest, followed by Ro-
mania, Kyrgyz Republic, Bulgaria, Armenia, Hungary, Albania, 
Kosovo and Serbia. In several countries in this “low inequality” 
bracket, income inequality and poverty are increasing, though, 
probably because of the post-Socialist erosion of public institu-
tions, the abrupt opening-up of weak economies and declining 
gross domestic product, among other factors. 

Relatively low inequality: In this bracket, urban Gini coef-
ficients range between 0.300 and 0.399, just below the inter-
national  alert  line  of  0.4  above  which  inequalities  may  have 
serious negative political, social and economic consequences for 
societies if not properly addressed. These countries are divided 
evenly between those with Gini coefficients under 0.34 (China, 
Poland and Lithuania) and those with values higher than 0.34 
(Algeria, Georgia and Tajikistan). Countries in this bracket typ-
ically feature healthy economic expansion, a degree of political 
stability and relatively homogenous societies with only narrow 
income and consumption disparities across social segments. 

Relatively  high  inequality:  This  corresponds  to  Gini 
coefficients between 0.400 and 0.449. This bracket comprises 
a  mix  of  countries  from  four  regions:  Africa,  Asia,  Eastern 
Europe and the CIS. In Africa, the urban areas of Cameroon, 
Uganda  and  Côte  d’Ivoire  feature  the  lowest  income-based 
Gini values, owing to recent policies that have strengthened 
institutions  and 
redistributive  mechanisms  against  a 
background of economic growth. In Asia, on the other hand, 
cities in Viet Nam and Nepal, and to a lesser extent Malaysia, 
exhibit  relatively  high  income  inequality  with  increasing 
urban Gini coefficients. In Eastern Europe, the highest urban 
Gini coefficient is to be found in Moldova (0.400). In the 
CIS, cities in Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan and Russia stand out 
for  their  high  degrees  of  income  inequality  compared  with 
the sub-region’s average (0.334). Some recent evidence points 
to  increasingly  pronounced  income  inequalities  in  Russia 
in  the  recent  past,  resulting  from  growing  unemployment, 
higher  cost  of  living  and  an  erosion  of  the  redistributive 
institutions.4 

High inequality: In this bracket, urban Gini coefficients 
range between 0.450 and 0.499 – above the threshold where 
city and other public authorities should address inequality as 

a matter of urgency. Most of the cities in this bracket are in 
Latin America and the Caribbean.5 General urban Gini values 
in El Salvador, Uruguay, Venezuela, Panama, Peru, Costa Rica, 
Paraguay, Mexico, Honduras and Bolivia are all high, although 
just under the region’s average (0.505). In Asia, inequality is 
high in the urban areas of the Philippines and Thailand. In 
this  bracket,  inequalities  are  approaching  dangerously  high 
levels; if the current trend continues, challenging conditions 
in many cities could discourage capital expenditure and lead 
to sporadic protests and riots. High income inequality is often 
linked to weak labour markets, inadequate capital investment 
in public services and lack of pro-poor social programmes.6 

Very  high  inequality:  This  is  the  bracket  where  Gini 
values  ranging  from  0.500  to  0.599  point  to  institutional 
and  structural  failures  in  income  distribution.  Again,  the 
majority  of  countries  in  this  bracket  are  in  Latin  America 
and  the  Caribbean,  a  region  where  urban  areas  have  been 
characterized by high income inequality for many years. In 
some  African  countries,  urban  income  inequalities  are  also 
becoming dangerously high, particularly in Nigeria, Kenya, 
Ethiopia and Zimbabwe. In Asia, Sri Lanka is the only country 
where urban areas feature very high income inequalities, with 
a Gini coefficient of 0.55 – far higher than the region’s average 
of 0.416.    

Extremely  high  inequality:  Whereas  the  urban  areas  in 
several countries in this review have experienced very serious 
income inequalities in recent years, only a few fall into the 
“extremely  high”  bracket  where  Gini  coefficients  reach  as 
high as 0.600 or more. Such extreme values often result from 
dysfunctional  labour  markets,  sluggish  economic  growth, 
structural problems of wealth distribution and institutional 
failure that reflect long-standing patterns of inequality. All the 
countries  in  this  group  are  in  Southern  Africa,  with  urban 
areas in the Republic of South Africa featuring the highest 
degree  of  income  inequality  in  the  world  (as  measured  by 
Gini coefficients).

The magnitude of consumption inequalities in urban areas

Recent  estimates  show  that  in  Africa’s  urban  areas  (see 
Map  2.2.2),  Togo’s  stand  out  as  the  least  unequal,  with  a 
consumption  Gini  coefficient  of  0.31,  or  one-third  below 
the  continent’s  average  urban  Gini  value  for  consumption 
(0.45). If anything, though, this relatively equitable income 
distribution reflects the almost uniform degree of poverty that 
characterizes Togo’s urban areas. This stands in sharp contrast 
with the low degree of inequality prevailing in Scandinavian 
cities, which instead reflects strong distributional institutions. 
Other countries where consumption-based Gini coefficients 
for urban areas are below Africa’s average include Morocco, 
Egypt, Mauritania, Democratic Republic of Congo, Central 
African Republic and Ethiopia, in ascending order (see Figure 
2.2.1). Serious distributional problems are found further south 
in Malawi and Namibia, with “very high” Gini values (0.52 
and  0.58,  respectively)  denoting  that  consumption  largely 
remains concentrated in a small segment of the population.

The consumption-based Gini values for the urban areas of all 
these countries are above the region’s average as measured by 
the sample, with Namibia’s coefficient exceeding that average 
by as much as 30 per cent.

By comparison, household expenditure in Asia’s urban areas 
is relatively less unequal. On this count, Indonesia features 
the  lowest  Gini  value  in  the  whole  region  (0.328)  and  is 
closely  followed  by  Pakistan,  Bangladesh  and  India,  whose 
urban areas all exhibit Gini values under the Asian average of 
0.379. The distribution of household expenditures in urban 
Sri Lanka and Cambodia is more unequal, with Gini values 
of 0.43. This suggests unequal access to basic goods that may 
hinder poverty reduction strategies, even against a background 
of economic growth.

Figure 2.2.3, countries in Latin America are clustered high on the 
Y axis, denoting high Gini coefficients, and around the middle of 
the X axis, denoting moderate per capita GDP. This relationship 
is even more obvious when compared with Eastern European 
countries featuring relatively similar GDPs per capita to those in 
Latin America, which is much more unequal. 

Figure  2.2.3  also  shows  that  most  of  the  countries  are 
noticeably clustered according to the Gini-based bracket that 
reflects their degree of inequality. For instance, countries in 
brackets 1 and 2 (“low” and “relatively low” income inequality 
in urban areas) are located at the lower right quadrant of the 
graph (low Gini values and relatively high GDP), and those

– it is clear that economic development somehow goes hand 
in hand with broader income distribution. In general terms, 
countries with low Gini coefficients belong to high-income 
groups,  except  for  some  in  Eastern  Europe  and  the  CIS 
(bracket 2) that are classified as moderate-income countries. 
On the other hand, high Gini coefficients are widespread in 
countries ranging from medium- to low-income levels, and 
particularly in poorer countries in Asia and Africa. 

This  relationship  between  higher  development  and  broader 
income  distribution  holds  in  all  of  the  countries  in  the  UN-
HABITAT sample; the only exception is Latin America and the 
Caribbean, where GDP per capita is significantly higher than 
in the other countries with very unequal incomes. As shown in

in brackets 5 and 6 (“very high” and “extremely high” income 
inequality) appear in the top left quadrant (high Gini values 
and  low  GDP).  Malaysia,  Botswana  and  South  Africa  are 
interesting  exceptions,  with  a  GDP  per  capita  significantly 
higher than other Asian and African countries in bracket 5, 
which are characterized by moderately unequal distributions 
of income. 

The concentration of inequalities is higher in urban than 
in rural areas.

Nationwide averages of inequality conceal differences across 
rural  and  urban  Gini  values,  as  well  as  among  degrees  of 
inequality across cities. In most countries, the average income 
gap between urban areas is greater than the average difference 
between national income and rural income. Exceptions are 
Morocco, Lesotho, Central African Republic, Cameroon and 
Botswana, where the total national Gini coefficient is higher 
than the Gini coefficient for the urban areas overall. 

The degree of inequality in both income and consumption 
is substantially greater in urban than in rural areas in general. 
Exceptions  include  Algeria,  Sierra  Leone,  Central  African 
Republic, Botswana and China, where inequality is slightly 
higher  in  rural  areas.  In  Asia  and  Africa,  inequalities  are 
growing  faster  in  urban  than  in  rural  areas.  Latin  America 
and the Caribbean is the only region in the developing world 
where indices of income inequality in both urban and rural 
areas are almost identical.7 In Latin America, the historically 

unequal allocation of land in rural areas has combined with 
ineffective redistributive policies in urban areas to reinforce 
ingrained patterns of inequality. The land distribution patterns 
established under Spanish colonial rule have institutionalized 
latifundia  and  hacienda  estates  where  indigenous  people 
were  forced  to  work  in  indentured  servitude;  subsequent 
agricultural  modernization  favoured  large  companies  over 
individual 
further  marginalizing 
indigenous  agriculturalists.  This  historical,  path-dependent 
process was further consolidated under military dictatorships 
and structural adjustment policies, and tackling this combined 
legacy  today  is  quite  a  challenge  for  land  reform  policies. 
In  urban  areas,  redistributive  policies  such  as  basic  service 
delivery  and  cash  transfers  have  failed  to  make  a  deep  and 
lasting impact on either urban or rural poverty.8

Regional trends in the economic urban divide

In  the  previous  edition  of  this  report,  UN-HABITAT 
showed  that  inequality  has  increased  since  the  1980s, 
particularly  in  transition  and  some  emerging  economies. 
New  information  shows  more  mixed  results  on  developing 
countries:  Latin  America  and  the  Caribbean  has  made 
some progress in recent years; Africa shows no clear pattern 
of  increase  or  decrease  of  inequalities  and  Asia  exhibits  a 
moderate overall increase. However, a closer examination of 
changes in urban Gini coefficients per region shows specific 
differences, which are reviewed in the next section.

Latin America and the Caribbean: A slight narrowing in 
the divide 

In  general,  urban  inequality  in  Latin  America  and  the 
Caribbean is declining, although it remains quite high. An 
analysis of income distribution trends in 17 selected countries 
in  the  region  shows  that  in  nine  countries  urban  Gini 
coefficients have fallen slightly from around 1999 to around 
2006. Nicaragua recorded the most significant decrease in its 
Gini coefficient, which dropped by approximately 10 per cent 
as  the  country  experienced  a  moderate  economic  recovery 
between the year 2000 and 2005, with annual GDP growth 
improving to about 4 per cent. 

The  next  best  performing  countries  in  the  region  were 
Brazil,  Chile,  Panama  and  Peru  where  income-based  Gini 
coefficients narrowed during this period by 7.4, 6.5, 5.6, and 
5.4 per cent, respectively. In Honduras, Mexico and Paraguay, 
Gini coefficients dropped by a range of 4.6 per cent to 3 per 
cent. Argentina stands out as a basket case: from 0.54 in 1999, 
its Gini coefficient had risen to 0.58 by 2002 in the aftermath 
of a severe economic crisis; a robust recovery ensued with five 
consecutive years (2003-2008) of over 8 per cent annual real 
growth in GDP, which by 2006 had reduced the Gini value 
to 0.52.

However, in the urban areas of five other Latin American 
countries (Uruguay, Guatemala, Colombia, Costa Rica and 
Dominican Republic), income inequalities have slightly risen 
or remained stable, regardless of economic growth rates above 
the region’s average.

The  recent  improvement  in  economic  conditions  in 
various countries across the region has resulted in a narrower 
income  gap  between  rich  and  poor.  However,  the  current 
financial and food crises are likely to hamper the chances for 
sustained  economic  growth  in  the  coming  years,  and  short 
of appropriate pro-poor policies, inequalities may rise again, 
instead of declining further. 

Africa: Mixed shifts in the economic urban divide 

Trends in the economic divide in Africa’s urban areas are 
mixed,  or  so  suggests  the  sample  in  the  UN-HABITAT 
survey  of  Gini  coefficients  for  various  periods.  Among  the 
13 countries under review, eight showed lower values (if only 
marginally for some) and five featured moderate to significant 
increases.  The  region’s  urban  areas,  and  in  sub-Saharan 
Africa  in  particular,  retain  the  highest  degrees  of  poverty 
in  the  world,  together  with  the  highest  prevalence  of  slum 
populations in urban areas. In African urban areas, progress 
in poverty reduction has been rather slow overall, and these 
mixed results in the distribution of income and consumption 
can only point to the hope of future improvements. 

According  to  recent  national  surveys  on  income  and 
expenditures  conducted  in  selected  African  countries,  the 
most  significant  reductions  in  Gini  values  in  urban  Africa 
took  place  in  Côte  d’Ivoire  between  2002  and  2008,  and 

in  Uganda  between  2003  and  2006,  when  the  respective 
coefficients decreasing from 0.51 to 0.44, and from 0.48 to 
0.43, respectively. Côte d’Ivoire experienced this significant 
narrowing in the economic urban divide even as annual GDP 
growth  rate  was  rather  poor  (under  1  per  cent),  reflecting 
the civil strife in the country at the turn of the century. In 
contrast,  the  significant  decline  in  income  inequalities  in 
Uganda coincided with annual growth rates of around 6 per 
cent – which goes to show that economic growth does not 
necessarily go hand in hand with increasing inequalities. This 
is the case in a few other African countries: Benin, Rwanda 
and  Tanzania  all  managed  to  reduce  urban  consumption 
inequalities in a dynamic economic environment where GDP 
growth ranged between 4 and 6.5 per cent. 

In the urban areas of several other African countries, the 
economic divide as measured by Gini coefficients has increased, 
signaling a widening gap between rich and poor in terms of 
access to basic resources. Burkina Faso, Egypt and Ethiopia 
have seen their urban consumption Gini coefficients increase 
by  7.8,  13.2  and  11.8  per  cent,  respectively.  In  Zambia, 
too, urban income inequality has increased by 8.2 per cent, 
pushing  the  country  into  the  “extremely  high”  inequality 
bracket – even as Zambia’s GDP grew at an annual rate of 
about 5.5 per cent between 2003 and 2006. In Mozambique, 
consumption inequalities have widened only marginally. 

Asia: The economic urban divide is widening

Asian countries are characterized by low to moderate degrees 
of income and consumption inequality overall (see Map 2.2.3). 
With the exception of the 1997/8 financial crisis, economic 
growth in Asia has been robust over the past two decades, more 
than doubling in real terms from 2.7 per cent to 5.8 per cent 
between 1990 and 2007.9 As a result, average incomes have 
increased in almost all Asian countries, and poverty has fallen 
nearly everywhere in the region, with the exception of Ban-
gladesh. 

In  the  urban  areas  of  seven  Asian  countries,  Gini 
coefficients  have  been  rising,  compared  with  decreases  in 
five other countries. Nepal, one of the few Asian countries 
that  has  undergone  an  economic  recession  in  recent  years, 
features  the  most  significant  increase,  with  its  urban  Gini 
coefficient soaring from 0.26 in 1985 – at the time, one of 
the lowest in the world – to 0.43 in 1996. In updated (2007) 
data,  the  Gini  coefficient  at  country  level  was  still  high  as 
economic  conditions  remained  unfavourable.10  Mongolia 
provides a variation on the same theme: the country’s urban 
consumption-based  Gini  coefficient  rose  some  16  per  cent 
from 2003 to 2006 – an annual increment of about 5 per cent 
– which was twice the rate of its economic growth during that 
period, pointing to a need for more effective redistribution 
policies. In the early years of the 21st century, China has also 
experienced remarkable and sustained economic growth that 
has contributed to lifting millions of people out of poverty; 
yet at the same time, income inequalities have been increasing 
in both urban and rural areas. According to UN-HABITAT

data, income inequality in China’s urban areas (as measured 
by Gini values) grew from 0.23 in 1988 to 0.32 in 2002, and 
has continued to rise. Though still relatively low, these Gini 
values represent a 39 per cent increase over the period. 

In urban Viet Nam, income inequalities increased by 17 per 
cent between 1993 and 2002 against a background of rapid 
economic growth. In urban Bangladesh in the 1990s, inequali-
ties in consumption increased by an even steeper 20 per cent, 
compared with 9 per cent in India and 6.3 per cent in Pakistan 
in the early 2000s. In India, the widening economic urban di-
vide came in sharp contrast to annualized GDP growth of over 
5 per cent in the early 2000s. India provides an apt demon-
stration of the practical implications of the difference between 
income-based and consumption-based Gini coefficients. The 
country compiles urban Gini coefficients based on consump-
tion only (i.e., excluding savings, namely, assets), which in this 
case  minimizes  the  extent  of  urban  economic  inequalities.11 

The increasing share of the top 1 per cent of income-earners in 
India’s total national income points to an even steeper surge in 
income inequality, especially since the early 1990s.12 

In the urban areas of five other Asian countries, the economic 
divide has narrowed in recent years, as reflected in income- or 
consumption-based Gini coefficients. Sri Lanka recorded the 
sharpest decline between 1990 and 2006: a drop of 11.3 per 
cent, or an annualized decline of -0.7 per cent. In the meantime 
in the country at large, Gini values also fell (from 0.62 in 1990 
to 0.55 in 2006). These improvements in both general urban 
and nationwide values coincided with a period of sustained (4.9 
per  cent)  economic  growth,  but  the  degree  of  consumption 
inequality remains high (at 0.43), suggesting that the benefits 
of overall prosperity are not as broadly distributed in Sri Lanka 
as they could be. Malaysia, Cambodia and the Philippines are 
the  three  other  Asian  countries  where  the  urban  economic 
divide narrowed in recent years.13

The magnitude of the divide in specific cities 

National  averages  tend  to  conceal  any  substantive 
differences  between  inequalities  in  a  country’s  urban  areas 
overall  and  those  in  specific  cities.  The  disparities  between 
the urban rich and the urban poor as measured in terms of 
income and consumption distribution in specific cities vary 
considerably across developing regions, with the stark rich-
poor divide most noticeable in African and Latin American 
cities, as suggested earlier. In both regions, the gap is often 
extreme compared with cities in Asia, Eastern Europe and the 
CIS, where the degree of inequality remains relatively low. 

Using an expanded dataset of city-specific Gini coefficients, 
UN-HABITAT  has  calculated  simple  averages  for  regions 
based on 109 cities selected for their noteworthy variations. 
The 37 African cities in the sample display the highest average 
Gini coefficient (based on income) of all regions, at 0.581. 
Next  come  the  24  selected  Latin  American  cities,  with  an 
average  Gini  coefficient  of  0.528.  Taken  together,  the  30 
selected  Asian  cities  feature  a  comparatively  low  degree  of 
income inequality, as measured by a Gini coefficient of 0.384. 
This  average  is  just  below  the  0.40  threshold,  above  which 
inequality is considered unacceptably high. Among the cities 
in the sample, those in Eastern Europe (8) and the CIS (10) 
feature the lowest average Gini values and, presumably, the 
greatest degrees of equality, at 0.298 and 0.322, respectively. 
(Figure 2.2.5).14 

Indices  of  income  inequality  aggregated  at  the  national 
urban  level  differ  from  the  averages  of  the  selected  cities. 
Although  a  clear  pattern  fails  to  emerge,  the  averages  of 
city-specific  Gini  coefficients  in  Africa  and  Latin  America 
are higher than those for the two regions’ aggregated urban 
Gini value, whereas in Asia, Eastern Europe and the CIS, the

converse  is  true. Variations  between  inequalities  at  the  city 
and  urban  levels  are  notable  in  Africa,  Latin  America  and 
Asia: while the average Gini coefficient for individual sampled 
cities in Africa stands at 0.581, its collective equivalent for the 
region’s urban areas overall is 0.539, a difference of 4 per cent 
(see Figure 2.2.5 and 2.2.6). In Eastern Europe and the CIS, 
variations between these two types of average are negligible: in 
Eastern Europe, for instance, the city-specific income-based 
Gini coefficient is 0.298, compared with 0.306 for its general 
urban  equivalent.  These  variations  confirm  the  assumption 
that  national  trends  cannot  account  for  what  is  happening 
in every city or sub-region in the same country, because the 
factors of inequality are determined by history and culture, 
and are largely influenced by local policies and actions. 

As  for  measures  of  the  economic  divide  based  on 
consumption  rather  than  income,  general  urban  or  city-
specific data are available only for countries in two regions: 
Africa  and  Asia.  Urban  Africa  consistently  shows  much 
higher  degrees  of  inequality  than  Asia,  based  on  both 
consumption and income. Even though, as might have been 
expected, values for consumption are lower than for income, 
here  again  Africa  remains  characterized  by  high  degrees  of 
inequality,  with  Gini  coefficients  of  0.394  for  the  average 
of  49  selected  cities  and  towns,  and  0.45  for  urban  areas 

in 15 countries. Asia similarly exhibits lower inequalities in 
consumption,  with  an  average  Gini  value  of  0.326  for  six 
selected cities and 0.379 for urban areas in seven countries.
 
The most unequal cities

Of all the cities in the UN-HABITAT sample, Buffalo City 
(East London), Johannesburg and Ekurhuleni (East Rand), 
among other South African cities, are the most unequal in the 
world, with extremely high Gini coefficients of 0.71 or more. 
They are followed by the Brazilian cities of Goiana, Fortaleza, 
Belo Horizonte and Brasilia: all of these feature income Gini 
coefficients above 0.60, making them the most unequal cities 
in  Latin  America  and  the  most  unequal  in  the  world  after 
South Africa (Figure 2.2.7). 

Colombian  cities  such  as  Bogotá,  Barranquilla  and  Calí, 
and Lagos in Nigeria, top the list of those where the urban 
economic divide is at its sharpest, alongside Chiangmai and 
Udonthani in Thailand,15 all of which feature income Gini 
coefficients  above  0.55  (which  is  considered  “very  high” 
inequality).  They  are  closely  followed  by  some  cities  in 
Argentina (Catamarca and Buenos Aires), Chile (Santiago and 
Chillan)  and  Ecuador  (Quito),  all  of  which  record  income 
Gini values between 0.55 and 0.51.

BOx 2.2.2: MEaSURiNg iNEqUaliTy: SoURcES aND TyPES oF DaTa
In the 2008/9 edition of this report, UN-HABI-
TAT drew from a relatively large dataset of Gini 
coefficients	for	94	cities	in	47	countries,	and	an	
additional  68  countries  with  data  aggregated 
at the national urban level. For the current re-
port, UN-HABITAT has expanded its dataset to 
city-level  data  for  119  cities  in  61  countries; 
national-level urban data for 72 countries; and 
sub-regional data for 216 predominantly urban 
states, provinces and districts in 15 countries. 
In  total,  the  enlarged  UN-HABITAT  database 
includes data on income and consumption dis-
tribution in a total 90 countries. The database 
has  also  been  updated.  Urban  inequalities  at 
the national or city level are calculated in the 
current  report  from  data  collected  between 
1988 and 2008. The previous report cited data 
from 1983 to 2005.

and the remaining 43 per cent on consumption. 
For the purposes of analyzing inequalities, esti-
mates for income and consumption have been 
systematically	separated.	Data	on	Gini	coeffi-
cients is derived from of a mix of sources. The 
Economic  Commission  for  Latin  America  and 
the	 Caribbean	 has	 compiled	 Gini	 coefficients	
for UN-HABITAT at the urban, rural and select-
ed city levels, based on data from household 
surveys and census information from 1989 to 
2007,  and  calculating  two  or  three  points  in 
time, where possible. The United Nations Eco-
nomic and Social Commission for Asia and the 
Pacific	has	produced	Gini	coefficients	through	a	
similar arrangement, calculating the values at 
the national, provincial or state, urban and city 
levels based on various sources, including na-
tional surveys, census data and special surveys 
that were conducted by the national statistical 
offices	in	selected	countries	in	different	years.	

Roughly	 57	 per	 cent	 of	 the	 Gini	 coefficients	
presented in this report are based on income, 

UN-HABITAT complemented the set of Gini co-
efficients	for	the	region	with	information	from	
the	Asian	Development	Bank,	the	World	Bank	
and	the	national	statistical	offices	and	planning	
units of various governments, as necessary. 

Gini	coefficients	for	cities	and	urban	areas	in	Af-
rica have been collected from various sources, 
as there is no central depository of such data 
in the region. UN-HABITAT approached national 
statistics	offices,	ministries	of	finance	and	plan-
ning  and  other  government  departments  in-
volved in poverty reduction and country strategy 
papers,  including  the  International  Monetary 
Fund	 and	 the	 South	 African	 Cities	 Network.	
UN-HABITAT	calculated	Gini	coefficients	for	the	
small	cities	and	towns	in	the	Lake	Victoria	Re-
gion in Tanzania, Uganda and Kenya based on 
its own urban inequality surveys. Such surveys 
were also conducted by UN-HABITAT in Addis 
Ababa,	Casablanca	and	Dakar.

Other highly unequal cities stand out as more isolated cases, 
with values well above the national average. They include (in 
decreasing  order):  Addis  Ababa,  Nairobi,  Maseru,  Mexico 
City, Ho Chi Minh City, Hong Kong and Port-au-Prince, 
all  featuring  Gini  coefficients  above  0.52,  which  ranks  as 
“very high”. 

For all these cities, the Gini coefficients are based on income. 
When values are based on consumption expenditures, they 
are  invariably  lower.  Addis  Ababa,  with  a  Gini  coefficient 
of  0.56,16  and  Maputo  and  Casablanca,  both  with  Gini 
coefficients of 0.52, feature the highest values in the world 
for consumption-based inequality. There can be little doubt 
that if data on income distribution in Maputo, Casablanca or 
other similar cities were available, it would show even greater 
degrees of inequality. 

The most equal cities 

The cities in the broader, updated UN-HABITAT sample 
returning lower Gini coefficients than those reviewed above 
are more likely to offer more equitable environments, with 
adequate  housing  and  affordable  basic  services.  Still,  this 
does  not  mean  that  measuring  economic  equality  in  a  city 
will reveal whether it affords residents all of the opportunities 
of  an  ideal  equitable  city.  The  Gini  coefficient  may  be  the 
most widely used measure of how equitable a city is, but as 
an  indicator  it  suffers  from  two  major  drawbacks:  (1)  the 
Gini coefficient fails to capture the proportion of a country’s 
population that is poor, and (2) it does not measure the non-
economic  dimensions  of  an  equitable  or  egalitarian  city,  as 
described above. The Gini method is a useful measure of a 
fairly  narrow  kind  of  inequality,  which  is  the  difference  in 
income  (or  consumption)  of  a  typical  individual  from  the 
incomes  of  those  right  above  and  below  them;  but  clearly, 

income inequality tells only part of the story of inequality in 
any given place.

sample  of  cities, 

Among  UN-HABITAT’s 

Jakarta, 
Chittagong, Dhaka, Khulna, Lomé, Freetown, Dar es Salaam, 
Phnom Penh, Bissau and Dakar stand out as the most egalitarian 
in the developing world, as measured by consumption-based 
Gini coefficients (with a range of 0.27 to 0.37). 

The  problem  is  that  the  “most  equal”  developing-world 
cities in the UN-HABITAT sample are in fact “equally poor 
cities”,  as  they  feature  similar  distribution  of  consumption 
expenditures across rich and poor. However, all these cities 
fail to provide water, sanitation or housing to all residents, and 
they feature some of the highest incidences of slums in their 
respective regions. The “most equal cities” in the sample also 
perform poorly on various social indicators. In Bangladesh, 
for  example,  Chittagong  and  Dhaka  –  with  consumption-
based Gini coefficients of 0.29 and 0.31, respectively – suffer 
from high rates of under-5 mortality, reaching 97 deaths per 
1,000 children at urban level nationwide and up to 130 in 
the  most  deprived  slum  settlements.  In  Dakar,  a  city  with 
relatively low consumption inequality (0.37), the literacy rate 
among women was 63 per cent in the year 2000, compared 
with 90 per cent for men; this combined into a female-to-
male literacy ratio of 0.7, reflecting a marked gender disparity 
in  the  Senegalese  capital.  Likewise,  in  Jakarta  and  Dar-es-
Salaam, overall literacy rates for women stand around 94 per 
cent, but in slums and the most deprived areas they drop to 
63 and 50 per cent, respectively. 

Another  feature  of  the  “equally  poor”  cities  in  the  UN-
HABITAT  sample  is  that  economic  growth  proceeds  at 
different paces. Some are dynamic and growing fast; others are 
experiencing slower paces of development. As they continue 
growing,  though,  cities  must  fulfil  two  related  duties  for 
the sake of their populations: (1) they must ensure that any

progress toward more egalitarian distribution of consumption 
is  going  to  remain  over  time,  and  (2)  they  must  enhance 
economic and social opportunities for the poor, women and 
other vulnerable groups, in the process reducing the systemic 
social  deprivations  that  prevent  certain  segments  of  society 
from achieving the benefits of an egalitarian city.

A review of income-based coefficients in the UN-HABITAT 
sample  shows  that  Beijing  is  the  “most  equal”  city  in  the 
world, with a Gini value as low as 0.22 in 2003. It is followed 
by Benxi, (0.29) and several other Chinese cities including 
Shanghai, Baoji and Xian, which all boast Gini coefficients 
below 0.37. Several cities in Jordan are also characterized by 
very low income Gini coefficients (between 0.31 and 0.35), 
including  Amman,  Jerash,  Ajloun,  Irbid,  Zarqa,  Mafrq, 
Balga,  and  Madaba.17  Hanoi  in  Viet  Nam  and  Caracas  in 
Venezuela also feature relatively low income inequality, with 
Gini coefficients below 0.39. 

Where and how is the economic urban divide decreasing?

A review of recent trends in inequality conducted by UN-
HABITAT  bears  only  on  a  limited  sample  of  48  cities  for 
which data is available: 19 in Africa, 22 in Latin America and 
only seven in Asia. It must be stressed here that the results 
depict  only  general  patterns,  but  can  nevertheless  point  to 
potential drivers of change.18 

In 27 out of these 48 cities, Gini coefficients are seen to 
decrease, though to a very small extent in some cases. In 11 
of those cities – eight in Africa, two in Latin America and 

one in Asia – the decrease in Gini coefficients is significant 
(by more than 1 per cent per year), ultimately changing by 
more than 10 per cent. Over the period recorded in the UN-
HABITAT sample, inequality actually increased in 21 cities. 
Of these, significant increases of more than 1 percent per year 
were notable in five cities in Africa, two in Latin America and 
two in Asia.

In the Ethiopian cities of Awasa, Bahir Dar and Jimma, Gini 
coefficients based on consumption declined substantially (by 
21 per cent, 10 per cent and 3 per cent, respectively) between 
1994 and the year 2000. Several factors may have been at 
play  behind  these  reductions  in  consumption  inequality: 
access to education, health services, nutrition, and water and 
sanitation have improved throughout the country, on top of 
significant development in infrastructure, roads, power lines 
and  telecommunications.19  A  recovery  in  food  production 
in the mid-1990s, coupled with relatively strong economic 
growth,  may  have  significantly  reduced  poverty  for  many 
households,  especially  in  places  most  affected  by  recurrent 
droughts.20  It  also  appears  that  expenditures  on  housing 
have not significantly affected consumption distribution, as 
rents  paid  to  kebeles  –  the  smallest  administrative  units  or 
associations of residents – in Awasa, Bahir Dar and Jimma 
may  have  experienced  a  lower  increase  than  the  Ethiopian 
capital of Addis Ababa in recent years (Figure 2.2.9). 

Elsewhere  in  Africa,  urban  economic  inequality  has  also 
declined in Accra, Ghana, by a significant 16 per cent between 
1987/8  and  1992,  and  in  Dakar  the  household  level  Gini 
coefficient declined by 9 per cent (0.458 to 0.419) between

1994/5 and 2001/2. In Dakar, the changes can be associated 
with rapid economic growth and Senegal’s intensive emphasis 
on  infrastructure  development,  which  generated  jobs  and 
promoted  self-employment.  Remittances  from  abroad  have 
also  been  a  significant  source  of  income  for  Dakar’s  poor 
households. According to a 2008 study by Senegal’s Ministry 
of Economy, remittances amounted to 500 billion CFA Francs 
(about US $1.1 billion) in 2007, a figure that has remained 
relatively stable in recent years. Cash transfers go primarily 
into household expenditures and investment in property. It is 
estimated that without these international transfers, poverty 
in Senegal would affect 53 per cent of the population, or 16 
per cent more than with remittances.21 

In South Africa, the cities of Mangaug, Tshwane (Pretoria), 
Johannesburg, and Cape Town experienced moderate (3 to 5 
per cent) reductions in Gini coefficients between 2001 and 
2005.  This  largely  reflects  significant  economic  and  social 
improvements,  particularly  the  introduction  of  a  social 
(minimum) wage and subsidized rates in basic service delivery, 
education  and  housing.22  Since  1994,  the  government  of 
South Africa has effectively been redistributing wealth and 
welfare resources, spending public funds and deploying social 
programmes  to  bring  about  a  more  equitable  distribution 
of public goods among the population. Back in 1975, the 
government’s share of social spending on the country’s black 
population was only 28 per cent, compared with 55 per cent 
on  the  white  population.  The  share  of  social  spending  on 
the black population increased to 51 per cent in 1990, 67 
per cent in 1993, and 80 per cent by 1997. In contrast, the 

share of social spending on the country’s white population 
decreased from 55 per cent in 1975 to 33 per cent in 1990, 
17 per cent in 1993, and 9 per cent in 1997. By 1997, race-
based  spending  allocations  were  roughly  proportionate  to 
each group’s share of South Africa’s population.23

In Latin America and the Caribbean, several Brazilian cities 
have recently (between 2005 and 2007) experienced significant 
declines  in  their  income  Gini  coefficients,  including  São 
Paulo (18 per cent), Rio de Janeiro (12 percent) and Brasilia 
(6 per cent). Decreases in income inequality in these cities are 
concomitant with those in overall urban Gini values in Brazil, 
which fell from 0.63 in 1999 to 0.60 in 2004 and 0.58 in 2007. 
The gradual drop in the Gini coefficient can be attributed in 
part to three well-documented factors: demographic trends, 
education policy and social protection. Declines in the size 
of Brazilian families and improvements in family dependency 
rates and access to education have helped reduce inequality. 
In the early and mid-1990s, universal admission to primary 
schooling and reductions in the rates of grade repetition led 
to a drop in the Gini coefficient by about 0.2 points per year 
from  1995  onward.  Direct  government  cash  transfers  to 
households through the Bolsa Familia programme have also 
reduced income inequality, and increases in other forms of 
social protection, such as an increased minimum wage, have 
led to a further decrease of 0.2 Gini points per year.24 These 
well-designed  and  targeted  social  policies  have  stimulated 
aggregate demand and consumption, enlarging the domestic 
market,  which  in  turn  spurred  further  increases  in  income 
and purchasing power (see Figure 2.2.10).25

In which cities are income inequalities growing and why? 

The  most  significant  increases  in  Gini  coefficients  in  the 
UN-HABITAT  sample  cities  have  occurred  in  Colombia, 
where measures of income inequality climbed by 24 per cent 
in Bogotá between 1991 and 2005, 10 per cent in Calí and 
4 per cent in Medellín between 1991 and 1998. Three well-
documented factors can account for the increases in income 
distribution  in  Colombian  cities.  First,  the  informal  sector 
has  led  in  new  job  creation,  in  the  process  demonstrating 
that the formal economy is not in a position to accommodate 
Colombia’s  growing  workforce.  According  to  estimates  by 
the  International  Labour  Organization,  eight  out  of  every 
10  jobs  created  in  the  1990s  were  low-quality  jobs  in  the 
informal economy.26 Second, wage discrepancies in Colombia 
are  becoming  much  more  significant  between  skilled  and 
less-skilled  workers,  with  better-skilled  workers  earning 
increasingly  more.  Similarly,  wages  of  college  graduates 
relative to high school graduates in Colombia increased by 21 
per cent between 1991 and 1995, and similar gaps have been 
recorded between workers who had graduated from secondary 
school and those who had not.27 In Colombia’s manufacturing 
sector, the wages of non-production or white-collar workers 
increased  in  relation  to  production  or  blue-collar  workers; 
overall,  differences  in  occupation  accounted  on  average  for 
15 per cent of labour income inequality in the 1990s.28 Third, 

increases in private investment, exports, capital inflows and 
currency overvaluation have resulted in greater inequality in 
Colombia. However, in recent years, the economy has grown 
by more than 6 per cent annually, and increased government 
social  spending  (in  the  form  of  subsidies  to  the  poor)  has 
helped to offset increases in income inequalities that might 
result from economic prosperity. 

Income inequalities also increased in Mexico City by 7 per 
cent (from 0.52 to 0.56) between 1992 and 2005. Among 
other  factors,  the  rise  in  the  city’s  Gini  coefficient  reflects 
declining  trade  union  affiliation  and  falling  real  minimum 
wages coupled with a shift in trade that has resulted in higher 
wages for more qualified workers. In Argentina, Buenos Aires 
experienced rising inequality (around 5 per cent) from 1990 
to 2005, a period marked by macro-economic stabilization 
policies, more open international economic flows, deregulation 
and structural reforms, including privatization. This 15-year 
trend  was  characterized  by  the  closure  of  manufacturing 
firms,  layoffs  in  privatized  companies  and  widespread 
unemployment, which culminated in the 2000/1 economic 
crisis. Recovery materialized only around 2003, but had no 
clear  influence  on  overall  socioeconomic  conditions  until 
2005.29 

In  Africa,  the  most  significant  increases  in  inequality  in 
recent years have occurred in Addis Ababa, where the Gini 
coefficient  for  consumption  rose  by  24  per  cent  between

Economists have long supported the idea that 
inequality  is  a  natural  consequence  of  urban 
growth and development. As a country’s popu-
lation becomes more and more urban and both 
the labour force and the productive sector shift 
from more equitable traditional and agricultural 
activities  to  less  equitable  modern,  industrial 
activities, inequalities are expected to increase 
until aggregate incomes rise to a point where 
all members of society reach a common stan-
dard  of  living.  Recently,  economists  have  ap-
plied this concept to cities of various sizes, ar-
guing that income inequality increases as city 
size grows, or that large cities tend to feature 
higher income disparities (as measured by Gini 
coefficients)	than	smaller	ones.	However,	what	
may be evident in the developed world has not 
been observed in the South.

Based  on  an  expanded  database  of  city-
specific	 Gini	 coefficients	 and	 a	 larger	 sample	
that  includes  small  and  intermediate  cities  in 
developing countries, UN-HABITAT has identi-
fied	 wide	 variations	 in	 Gini	 values	 across	 the	
city size spectrum. For example in a large city 
like	Hong	Kong,	the	Gini	coefficient	stands	at	

0.53, compared with only 0.22 in China’s capi-
tal Beijing.  In Jordan, the small cities of Jerash 
and	 Irbid	 feature	 low	 Gini	 coefficients	 (0.31),	
or nearly half those of similar-sized Monoregala 
and	Rathnapura	in	Sri	Lanka.	

One	of	the	most	significant	findings	in	this	anal-
ysis	is	that	average	Gini	coefficients	for	small,	
intermediate  and  large  cities  in  the  sample 
are  quite  similar,  and  no  clear  trend  emerges 
whereby large cities are “more unequal” than 
smaller ones, or vice-versa. The poor relation-
ship	 found	 between	 city-specific	 Gini	 values	
and  population  size  challenges  the  previously 
accepted view that narrow wage distributions 
(i.e.,	low	Gini	values)	are	a	defining	feature	of	
small and intermediate cities while larger ones, 
as	the	typical	hosts	to	both	highly	paid	work-
ers (with advanced technical and professional 
training) and poor immigrants, naturally feature 
much broader income disparities. On the con-
trary, UN-HABITAT surveys of urban inequalities 
in	17	towns	around	Lake	Victoria	in	East	Africa	
found	Gini	coefficients	similar	to,	or	higher	than,	
those  in  the  capital  cities  of  their  respective 
countries. For instance, the consumption-based 

Gini	coefficient	for	Bukoba,	with	a	population	of	
about 100,000, stands at 0.34, the same as for 
Dar	es	Salam.	Likewise,	the	Kenyan	towns	of	
Migori	and	Kisii	feature	income	Gini	coefficients	
of  0.558  and  0.631,  respectively,  compared 
with Nairobi’s 0.58. Clearly, city size is not nec-
essarily – nor even evidently, according to UN-
HABITAT’s analysis of urban settlements in the 
developing world – a determinant of inequality. 
Cites and countries can feature such drastically 
different cultural and political histories, policies 
and paths to development that it is not possible 
to establish a direct relationship between city 
size and the distribution of income. 

This	 is	 why	 city	 authorities	 and	 policymakers	
must be well aware of the particular ways in 
which  their  cities  are  growing  and  changing 
over time. Improved living conditions for low-
income and middle-class residents, and bridg-
ing not just the economic but also social, racial 
and cultural divides through redistributive poli-
cies,  conscious  urban  planning  and  subsidies 
for housing and other needed amenities, would 
all go a long way toward building economically 
integrated communities in cities of all sizes.

the  year  2000  and  2003;  and  in  Abidjan,  where  the  Gini 
coefficient increased by 21 per cent between 2002 and 2008. 
Significant  increases  in  consumption  inequality  were  also 
recorded  in  the  Ethiopian  cities  of  Dessie  and  Dire  Dawa 
(11 and 8 per cent, respectively), and in Maputo, capital of 
Mozambique, where consumption-based Gini values rose by 
18 per cent between 1996 and 2003. While the proportion 
of people in Mozambique living below the poverty line fell by 
15 per cent nationwide between 1996 and 2003, growth in 
consumption has been much faster for better-off than poorer 
residents, clearly suggesting that economic growth in Maputo 
may not be as equitable as in other parts of the country.30 

The high degree of consumption inequality in Addis Ababa 
can be attributed to a combination of factors, particularly the 
enduring effects of the policy choices made under the country’s 
structural adjustment programme, with its lifting of subsidies 
on  basic  services,  public  expenditure  cuts,  tax  reform  and 
credit restrictions, all of which contributed to the persistence 
of  poverty  and  inequality,  particularly  in  the  capital  city.31 
The  economic  and  political  transition  in  the  country  has 
brought increased capital expenditure that is more beneficial 
for people with relatively better skills and high initial asset 
accumulation, most of whom are located in the capital city.32 
Gradual deregulation of social housing in the hands of kebeles 
has resulted in a disproportionate increase in housing rents for 
the urban poor in Addis Ababa. 

 

All unequal cities are not so in the same way

UN-HABITAT  data  and  analysis  confirm  that  urban 
income inequalities take different forms across different cities 
and  carry  a  variety  of  dimensions  with  them.  It  frequently 
happens that the income-based Gini coefficient for a city does 
not reflect the “bundle of commodities and services” available 
to residents; this has led an increasing number of countries 
to adopt consumption or household expenditure as a more 
accurate benchmark of inequality. Cities, and countries such 
as India, that make various subsidies available to low-income 
groups tend to feature lower consumption inequality, as they 
enable people to access basic goods for free or at reduced rates. 
Similarly, Canadian cities tend to be less unequal than those 
in the United States, as Canada maintains a range of social 
policies that target the poor and the vulnerable. 

At times, inequalities in urban incomes conceal other types 
of divides, or fail to capture achievements in public service 
delivery  or  literacy.  UN-HABITAT  data  shows  that  while 
Brazilian  cities  generally  tend  to  experience  extremely  high 
degrees  of  income  inequality,  they  fare  better  than  highly 
unequal  cities  in  poor  African  countries  when  it  comes  to 
access to piped water and sanitation. For instance, in 2007, 
even though Brazil’s capital city Brasilia featured a very high 
(0.60) income Gini coefficient, 90 per cent of the population 
had  access  to  piped  water  and  85  per  cent  to  sanitation.

NoT TEll THE WHolE SToRy
For all its relevance as an indicator of wealth distribution, income 
inequality	is	not	sufficient	to	describe	what	is	actually	happen-
ing in a community, or how that community might change for 
better	or	worse.	Focusing	on	income	inequality	and	overlooking	
other social, cultural and political indicators of well-being is to 
see only one side of the picture. 

A	consensus	is	emerging	among	academics	and	policymakers	
that inequality is multidimensional and cannot be viewed solely 
through the prism of income. It is now generally accepted that 
human beings can have access to a variety of assets, freedoms 
and opportunities, besides income, on which they can rely not 
just to survive but also to express their social and other identi-
ties. More often than not, these forms of social capital are not 
reflected	in	economic	surveys,	which	are	more	concerned	with	
earned	income	figures	for	various	groups.	Surveys	also	fail	to	
capture “the hidden economy” of households, such as unpaid 
labour	or	in-kind	and	cash	assistance	from	relatives	and	friends.	
The various dimensions of “wealth” are fundamental to Amartya 
Sen’s concept of “entitlements” and the “capabilities” approach 
to development, which holds that the quality of an individual’s 
life should be measured not by their income, but by the rights 
and freedoms s/he enjoys.

fifth	 took	 home	 only	 US	 $600	 more	 than	 the	
previous	year,	and	the	middle	fifth	stagnated,	
earning  only  US  $300,  or  0.6  per  cent,  more 
than they had in 2005.

The United States has more cities with a Gini 
coefficient	 of	 0.50,	 or	 higher	 than	 any	 other	
wealthy	 country.	 Gini	 coefficients	 based	 on	
2006 data for 247 American cities with popu-
lations over 100,000 range from 0.35 to 0.57. 
Forty	 cities	 feature	 Gini	 coefficients	 above	
0.50, indicating high income inequality due to 
poverty and racial segregation, post-industrial 
economic  restructuring  and  combinations  of 
inner-city decline and suburban sprawl. 

In	“the	other	America”,	poor	black	families	and	
the  chronically  unemployed  are  clustered  in 
ghettos,	 lacking	 access	 to	 quality	 education,	
secure tenure, lucrative employment and politi-
cal power. Higher inequality often corresponds 
with	 greater	 segregation,	 especially	 for	 black	
residents.  The  most  unequal  city,  Atlanta, 
Georgia,	has	the	third-highest	degree	of	black	
segregation,	followed	by	New	York	City,	Wash-

ington,  D.C,  Fort  Lauderdale,  and  Miami  (all 
with	Gini	coefficients	above	0.52).	

In Chicago, discriminatory mortgage lending and 
public  housing  development  from  the  1960s 
onward conspired to isolate many low-income 
black	families	in	the	central	city.	Lack	of	afford-
able  housing  outside  the  city  centre,  coupled 
with  high  unemployment  and  poor  education, 
has further undermined social mobility and eco-
nomic advancement. In Washington, D.C., the 
vast	majority	of	black	residents	live	on	the	east-
ern side of the metropolitan area, far from the 
economic  prosperity,  wealth,  job  growth,  and 
quality schools now concentrated in the west.

Earning power and income prospects depend 
on a geography of opportunity, i.e., access to 
good-quality  institutions,  decent  housing  and 
amenities that foster good health and prosper-
ity.  Even  where  standards  of  living  are  high, 
the marginalization and spatial segregation of 
specific	groups	creates	cities	within	a	city:	dis-
tinctly deprived areas that further reinforce un-
equal opportunities and the distance between 
abject	poverty	and	affluence.

For  many  people  in  the  United  States,  mov-
ing	up	from	the	lowest	economic	ranks	to	the	
middle class, and from the middle class to the 
top income echelons, is becoming increasingly 
difficult.	The	richest	1	per	cent	of	households	
now  earns  more  than  72  times  the  average 
income	of	the	poorest	fifth	of	the	population,	
and	 23	 times	 that	 of	 the	 middle	 fifth.	 In	 just	
one  year,  between  2005  and  2006,  the  rich-
est 1 per cent of the U.S. population increased

Schill & Wachter, 1995; Sherman, 2009; Steffel Johnson, 2006; Von Hoffman, 2009

On the other hand, Ethiopia’s capital city Addis Ababa also 
featured a very high Gini coefficient (0.612) in 2003, but only 
two-thirds of the population had access to piped water and 
only 44 per cent to adequate sanitation. While these numbers 
show that near-universal access to services does not necessarily 
result in lower income inequality, they also demonstrate that 
measures  of  income  inequality  do  not  necessarily  capture 
those determinants of quality of life that are associated with 
social indicators like health and well-being. 

In some cities, significant income inequality is often closely 
related to other types of inequalities. With its relatively high 
consumption Gini coefficient of 0.64 in 2006, Lagos is among 
the most unequal cities in sub-Saharan Africa. This is reflected 
in shelter indicators such as living area and sanitation, as well 
as  in  high  unemployment  rates  among  males.  Nearly  two-
fifths  of  Lagos  residents  live  in  overcrowded  housing,  and 
a quarter have no access to adequate sanitation. The city is 
also unable to provide jobs for its growing population, with 
40 per cent of males and 12 per cent of females unemployed 
in 2006. On the other hand in Mexico, income inequality 
in  Guadalajara  is  relatively  low  compared  with  other  Latin 
American  cities,  and  this  situation  happens  to  be  matched 
by healthy shelter and social indicators; residents enjoy near-

universal access to safe water and sanitation, and almost all 
are literate. 

Surprisingly, slum prevalence or “ghettoization” may or may 
not influence income inequality in any particular city. In some 
of the most unequal cities in Latin America and the United 
States, for instance, it is only a relatively small proportion of 
the population that lives in slums or urban ghettos, and yet 
inequality  remains  high.  In  those  cities  where  poverty  and 
wealth are concentrated in specific areas, income inequality 
measures  may  also  fail  to  capture  important  dimensions  of 
the  urban  divide.  For  instance,  Simi  Valley,  California,  on 
the  outskirts  of  Los  Angeles,  enjoys  a  relatively  low  degree 
of  income  inequality  (with  a  Gini  coefficient  of  0.37) 
because it is a relatively homogenous and wealthy “bedroom 
community”, whose members are isolated from impoverished 
or less wealthy communities within the city of Los Angeles. 
Washington, D.C., on the other hand, is significantly more 
unequal  (0.537),  which  is  reflected  in  the  spatial  division 
of the U.S. capital by both wealth and race factors, with its 
significant, and largely poor, black and Hispanic communities 
concentrated in certain areas. The same pattern can also be 
seen  in  New  Orleans,  with  large  pockets  of  wealth  amid 
populations that suffer from endemic poverty.

Corruption  and 
inequality  deprive 
communities  and  the  poor  not  only  of  mate-
rial wealth, but also of opportunities and liveli-
hoods.	Generally	defined	as	the	misuse	of	pub-
lic	office	for	private	gain,	corruption	can	take	
the  form  of  “grand  corruption”,  when  legisla-
tive and executive bodies implement economic 
policies	for	the	benefit	of	a	small	segment	of	
the  population;  “legislative  corruption”,  when 
under	 lobbyists’	 influence	 lawmakers	 favour	
specific	interest	groups;	and	“bureaucratic	cor-
ruption”,	when	officials	seek	bribes.	

All	types	of	corruption	take	advantage	of	struc-
tural	 deficiencies	 in	 the	 political,	 judicial	 and	
economic  institutions  of  developing  countries 
that	are	already	stacked	against	the	poor.	

Empirical research into the causal relationship 
between  corruption  and  income  inequality 
suggests	that	it	would	take	only	a	10	per	cent	

decrease in corruption to increase GDP growth 
by 2.8 per cent in Africa, 2.6 per cent in Latin 
America and the Caribbean, and 1.7 per cent 
in OECD and Asian countries. Africa is where 
corruption  is  most  detrimental  to  economic 
growth, and Latin America where the phenom-
enon most deeply affects income equality. Re-
searchers  infer  that  a  one-standard-deviation 
decrease  in  corruption  would  lower  the  Gini 
coefficient	of	income	distribution	(on	a	0	to	1	
scale)  by  0.05  point  in  the  OECD  area,  0.14 
point  in  Asia,  0.25  point  in  Africa,  and  0.33 
point in Latin America. 
Corruption has pervasive social and economic 
consequences,	 and	 policymakers’	 failure	 to	
tackle	these	as	part	of	broader	efforts	to	pro-
mote  equity  and  equality  only  encourages  a 
vicious cycle of interrelated increases in both 
corruption  and  income  inequality.  Corruption 
stymies  economic  growth  and  therefore  can 

affect  income  distribution,  economists  have 
shown; sociologists have found that the reverse 
is also true: income inequality can increase cor-
ruption if the phenomenon is considered as ac-
ceptable behaviour in an unequal society. 

Corruption	 makes	 public	 spending	 less	 effi-
cient, especially in vital welfare and education 
areas. In Uganda, only 13 per cent of central 
government  spending  on  some  educational 
programmes reached its destination between 
1991 and 1994. 

Specific	 policies,	 or	 attempts	 to	 strengthen	
financial	 and	 legal	 monitoring	 schemes,	 are	
not	enough	to	tackle	corruption;	also	required	
are	quick	and	efficient	prosecution	of	offenders	
and anti-poverty, redistributive policies. Target-
ing corruption without addressing its systemic 
counterpart, inequality, may doom anti-corrup-
tion efforts to failure.

Quick Facts 

1.  The urban spatial divide is more than the 

physical expression of income inequalities 
among households; it is also a by-product of 
inefficient land and housing markets.

2.  A spatial poverty trap occurs when physical 

distance to the city centre (and the associated 
benefits and opportunities) turns into social 
distance. 

3.  The poverty trap involves a combination of 

six factors: poor job opportunities, living 
conditions and social interactions; and high 
rates of gender disparities, social exclusion 
and criminality.

4.  Schemes and policies to reduce social 

disparities have been reported in only one-
third of the African, Asian and Latin American 
countries under review. 

5.  Inequality in all its forms is detrimental to 

any society, and when it becomes excessive 
inequality poses a danger to social stability and 
sustained economic growth.

Policy Points 

1.  Absence of policy coordination between or 

within national and local government constrains 
cities’ ability to meet the requirements of urban 
development and to deploy strategies that 
mitigate spatial inequality.

2.  Social policies should not be devised 

exclusively as nationwide programmes if they 
are effectively to address the determinants of 
spatial inequality in cities and, more generally, 
the urban divide. 

3.  More gender-specific schemes, like maternity 

and childcare benefits, vocational training, 
protecting women’s rights at the workplace, 
and micro-credit are required if women are to 
be lifted out of the spatial poverty trap.

2.3

The Spatial Divide
Marginalization and its 
outcomes

The spatial dimension of inequality: 
The poverty trap

Inequalities in cities are not only about income and 

consumption expenditures; they also reflect entrenched 
patterns  of  urban  development  and  ownership  of 
physical space. Whereas cities in the developed world 
tend to facilitate social and economic mixing by encouraging 
diverse land uses, providing various types of housing (social, 
low-income,  middle  class),  and  developing  transportation 
systems that facilitate urban mobility, numerous cities of the 
South are characterized by stark segregation between rich and 
poor.  Socioeconomic  clustering  in  cities  of  the  developing 
world is a consequence of limited service and transportation 
infrastructure, coupled with lack of housing choice. The poor, 
unable to afford land or shelter in the limited areas of the city 
that are fully serviced, have access only to the least desirable 
and most densely developed spaces. The rich, on the other 
hand, can invest in private housing on secluded properties, 
often paying for their own water systems, electricity generators 
and road maintenance. 

Income  inequality  effectively  restricts  available  options 
when it comes to choosing the best residential location based 
on factors such as proximity to jobs, schools and institutions; 
neighborhood preferences and housing types; access to credit 
opportunities  and  economic  incentives;  and  other  factors. 
While income inequalities are a main dividing factor between 
different social areas, the spatial inequalities visible in so many 
cities  are  also  an  outgrowth  of  broader-ranging  processes 
of  urban  development,  governance  and  institutionalized 
exclusion of specific groups. 

As discussed in Chapter 1.3, the separation between rich 
and  poor  takes  many  forms  in  the  cities  of  the  developing 
world.  In  some,  particularly  in  sub-Saharan  Africa,  large 
numbers  of  slum  households  are  clustered  in  specific  areas 
that  dominate  the  cityscape,  and  can  represent  as  much  as 
80  per  cent  of  all  urban  neighbourhoods.  This  is  the  case, 
for instance, in Bangui, Central Africa Republic; N’Djamena, 
Chad; Niamey, Niger; and the cities of Addis Ababa, Maputo 
and  Luanda.  In  other  cities,  such  as  Kathmandu,  Almaty, 
Managua, Guatemala City and Cotonou, to name just a few, 
poor  neighborhoods  hosting  a  mix  of  slum  and  non-slum 
households are clearly visible at the periphery of the city, in

the  decaying  urban  centres,  or  in  scattered  “slum  islands” 
in  the  interstices  of  formal,  fully  serviced  settlements.  The 
spatial divide in such cities constitutes more than the physical 
expression of income inequalities among households; it is also 
a by-product of the inefficient land and housing markets that 
force non-poor and middle-income households to reside in 
slum areas for lack of better alternatives. 

When slum areas are physically isolated and disconnected 
from the main urban fabric, residents become cut off from 
the city, often enduring longer commuting times and higher 
transportation costs than they would if their neighbourhoods 
were  more  integrated  into  city  systems.  Residents  of  such 
settlements  find  themselves  facing  problems  related  not 
only  to  low  incomes  or  shelter  deprivations,  but  also  to 
the social distance between themselves and those who have 
greater access to the opportunities and amenities of the city. 
Combined, the physical and social distance between poor and 
rich neighbourhoods represents a spatial poverty trap marked 
by six distinct challenges:

Severe  job  restrictions.  Opportunities  for  work  around 
slum settlements in remote areas may be restricted, leaving 
residents  vulnerable  to  unemployment.  For  example,  in 
Mexico, 20 per cent of workers spend more than three hours 

commuting  to  and  from  work  every  day.  Long-distance 
commuting  is  exacerbated  by  inefficient  and  costly  public 
transport  systems,  which  add  to  the  fragmentation  of  the 
urban  economy  and  further  divide  the  urban  space,  to  the 
detriment of slum dwellers. 

Gender  disparities.  Evidence  shows  that  women  from 
isolated  slum  areas  are  effectively  forced  to  work  closer  to 
home than men because of the variety of risks they may face, 
such as exposure to crime and difficulty in accessing transport. 
Women often also need to be closer to home than men to care 
for family members and carry out household responsibilities. 
In the Sanjay slum in Delhi, for instance, 75 per cent of men 
have been found to work within 12 kilometres of their homes, 
whereas  75  per  cent  of  women  worked  within  a  radius  of 
only 5 kilometres of home, showing how their employment 
opportunities are restricted. 

Worsening living conditions. Spatial mismatches between 
job  location  and  place  of  residence  can  leave  more  remote 
slum-dwellers  little  alternative  but  to  spend  the  night  in 
public spaces, squat in temporary units devoid of adequate 
services, or share houses in overcrowded conditions. In Rio 
de Janeiro, some workers sleep on beaches during the week, 
saving commuting time as well as transportation costs that

consume  at  least  20  per  cent  of  their  wages.  Similarly  in 
Dhaka and Mumbai, slum-dwelling workers are often found 
sleeping on the pavement, travelling home only for weekends 
and holidays.

Social exclusion and marginalization. In neighbourhoods 
with poor connections to the city, permanent access to health 
and  education  facilities  is  difficult,  not  only  on  account  of 
physical accessibility, but also because of the costs and time 
involved in transportation. In Mumbai, for instance, 50 per 
cent of slums have no access to primary schools, a percentage 
that is even higher in the informal areas on the outskirts of the 
city. In Chittagong, the number of kindergarten schools for 
relatively well-to-do households is on the increase, while many 
children in distant slums have almost no access to education.

Lack of social interaction. Physical segregation in terms 
of  distance,  time  and  costs  reduces  the  opportunities  for 
members of different income groups to interact. As a result, 
social  capital  in  its  various  forms  is  built  only  among  the 
poor, or based on other affinities such as ethnicity. In such 
conditions, the positive effects of social capital are neutralized, 
because interaction among unemployed people for instance, 
does not increase employment opportunities. In those distant 
and  isolated  neighbourhoods  that  effectively  function  as 
spatial  poverty  traps,  it  is  more  likely  that  social  interaction 
can eventually encourage crime, as a strong sense of rejection 
can lead to anti-social behaviour. 

High  incidence  of  crime.  When  confined  to  remote 
locations, slum dwellers are also penalized by reduced access 
to  the  various  opportunities  the  city  has  to  offer.  Long-
distance commuting in dark, underserved areas increases the 
risk of crime. The poor are more defenceless than other social 
groups  and  often  rank  among  the  prime  victims  of  urban 
crime. However, they also rank among the perpetrators. In 
São  Paulo,  for  instance,  the  number  of  homicides  in  some 
isolated neighbourhoods has been reported to be more than 
five times as high as in the safest districts. 

The survey conducted in 2009 by UN-HABITAT in 27 se-
lected cities in Africa, Asia and Latin America points to some 
of  the  fundamental  policy  roots  of  spatial  inequality.  (See 
Chapter 2.1 for the survey methodology.) In the absence of policy 
coordination between national, local or other tiers of govern-
ment, cities are clearly constrained in their ability to meet the 
requirements of regional development and to deploy strategies 
that would mitigate spatial inequality. The survey shows that 
in cities in Latin America, both national and local authorities 
were  involved  in  urban  policy  initiatives,  while  in  Asia  and 
Africa, national policies were predominant without commen-
surate regional or local implementation at the city level.

Another  important  factor  behind  policy  dysfunction 
is  that  social  policies  are  often  formulated  as  national 
programmes,  with  little  if  any  consideration  for  local 
conditions or geographical scope, in the process overlooking 
regional asymmetries and specific needs. When determined 
solely  at  national  level,  social  policies  ignore  the  specific 
spatial inequalities that must be addressed in the congested 

and  highly  competitive  urban  and  regional  environments. 
Regarding social disparities, only fewer than 35 per cent of 
all respondents to the UN-HABITAT questionnaire reported 
that schemes were in place to reduce them in African, Asian 
and  Latin  American  cities.  Respondents  also  reported  that 
such  urban  public  services  or  goods  as  waste  collection, 
recreation facilities, public parks and free spaces were largely 
unavailable  in  all  three  regions.  Inter-regional  comparisons 
show  that  Latin  America  fares  significantly  better  than  the 
other two regions, although the level remains quite low.

On  gender  equality,  UN-HABITAT  survey  returns 
suggest  that  apart  from  setting  minimum  percentages  for 
female employees in the public and private sectors, all other 
gender-specific  schemes  (maternity  and  childcare  benefits, 
provision of specific skills and vocational training, protecting 
women’s rights at the workplace, micro-credit facilities) are 
largely  lacking  in  all  three  regions,  with  fewer  than  25  per 
cent of respondents reporting that any of these were in place, 
particularly in remote and isolated slum settlements. Moreover, 
the incidence of policy initiatives in support of informal sector 
employment – either through job enhancement or legalization 
of certain informal sector activities – was, again, found to be 
very low in all three regions.

The central role played by economic inclusiveness may be 
best  understood  from  a  contrarian  perspective:  economic 
exclusion automatically tends to drive individuals out of the 
social, political and cultural spheres, resulting in a “capabilities” 
constraint.1 In this process, the poor are made poorer by the 
other forms of marginalization they are subjected to, and are 
excluded from those opportunities that help create capabilities 
of  any  kind  in  the  first  place.  As  the  survey  findings  for 
Bogotá demonstrate, poverty acts as a major hindrance to any 
effective “right to the city”. 

The interrelationships between the economic and other three 
dimensions of inclusiveness (or otherwise) are such that, over 
time, social, political and cultural exclusion tend to undermine 
the very possibility of equal economic opportunities. Countries 
and cities are subject to changing historical factors that make 
their development path-dependent, and they are challenged 
by internal factors that only add to divisiveness. These include 
divisions based on racial, ethnic, religious and other political 
allegiance  factors.  Despite  efforts  to  provide  an  equal  basis 
for  all  individuals  in  society  in  the  three  regions  (through 
the national constitution, affirmative action laws and other 
such regulatory measures), enforcement of these rights seems 
to be weak and tends to reinforce various forms of exclusion 
over time. UN-HABITAT survey findings clearly show this 
to  be  the  case.  Over  the  past  two  to  three  decades,  public 
authorities  in  the  three  regions  under  review  have  largely 
failed to deploy the sustainable policies required to reduce the 
urban divide on a scale commensurate with their respective 
urban  growth  rates.  Even  more  importantly,  survey  returns 
on average point to a clear lack of coordination between (in 
most cases) national policies and (in some instances) the local 
level as well as to poor concerted action to address the spatial 
divide which, in many cases, turns into a poverty trap.

Most household surveys fail to capture any dif-
ferences  in  access  to  services,  or  control  over 
resources, among members of the same house-
hold.	 This	 comes	 in	 stark	 disregard	 of	 the	 fact	
that intra-household inequalities are increasingly 
recognized as detrimental to the social and eco-
nomic advancement of women. 

UNIFEM’s Progress of the World’s Women 2008/9 
report notes that owing to women’s limited de-
cision-making	power	within	the	household,	their	
relationship	to	the	public	sphere	or	to	markets	is	
often mediated by men. This means that women 
may	not	be	in	a	position	to	make	important	deci-
sions about what services the household should 
prioritize,  as  they  are  often  under  pressure  to 
favour the needs of males over those of others 
in	 the	 family.	 Women’s	 lack	 of	 agency	 in	 the	
household has severe consequences with regard 
to their access to services such as health care 
and education.

Demographic and Health Surveys conducted be-
tween  1999  and  2005  showed  that  more  than 
half of married women in sub-Saharan Africa and 
South Asia had no say over decisions regarding 
their  own  health  care.  In  both  regions,  women 
also	 wielded	 little	 decision-making	 power	 over	
daily  household  purchases.  Moreover,  more 
than 40 per cent of married women in both sub-
Saharan Africa and South Asia reported that they 
were  not  allowed  to  visit  relatives  when  they 

chose. The notion that women “rule the roost” 
was  evidently  not  borne  out  by  DHS  statistics, 
which	further	showed	that	one	in	five	women	in	
sub-Saharan	 Africa	 did	 not	 even	 have	 the	 final	
say	over	what	food	to	cook.

Stark	 differences	 have	 been	 noted,	 however,	
between married women in South Asia and oth-
ers in the eastern part of the continent. Married 
women in East Asia are among the most eman-
cipated  in  the  developing  world.  Surveys  show 
that	large	numbers	in	this	region	not	only	make	
final	 decisions	 regarding	 their	 own	 health	 care,	
but are almost completely in charge of what to 
purchase	 for	 the	 household	 and	 what	 to	 cook	
for	dinner.	While	this	may	reflect	gender-based	
roles in which women are expected to carry out 
domestic chores, women in this region also ex-
ercise  control  over  other  aspects  of  their  lives. 
Unlike	their	sisters	in	South	Asian	countries	such	
as	 India,	 Afghanistan	 and	 Pakistan,	 more	 than	
90 per cent of women in this region do not need 
their spouses’ permission to visit relatives.

ing	 water	 can	 involve	 walking	 long	 distances	
for  long  stretches  of  time.  Recent  research  on 
sub-Saharan Africa suggests that women spend 
some 40 billion hours a year collecting water – 
the equivalent of a year’s worth of labour by the 
entire	 workforce	 in	 France.	 Capital	 expenditure	
on  access  to  water  provision  for  households 
would release substantial amounts of women’s 
time  on  a  day-to-day  basis,  opening  up  fresh 
opportunities, including self-improvement. Simi-
larly, when women have little say if any in their 
own	health	care,	they	are	in	no	position	to	make	
important decisions about the number of children 
they should have or whether or not to use contra-
ception. In extreme cases, it may also mean that 
they	 are	 likely	 not	 to	 get	 treatment	 when	 they	
need it, and are therefore vulnerable to debilitat-
ing injuries and early death. Similarly, women’s 
lack	 of	 decision-making	 powers	 in	 other	 areas	
concerning  the  household,  including  children’s 
opportunities, hardly puts them in a good posi-
tion	to	make	sure	their	children	go	to	school	or	
receive adequate nutrition. 

At	 a	 much	 more	 fundamental	 level,	 lack	 of	 a	
voice when deciding which services to prioritize 
has serious consequences. For instance, in most 
societies,  women  are  in  charge  of  domestic 
chores,	such	as	washing,	cleaning	and	cooking.	
When access to water is limited or non-existent, 
it is for women to ensure that their families have 
enough	water	for	drinking	and	bathing.	Retriev-

Since  any  country’s  development  is  intimately 
linked	to	how	well	or	badly	its	female	population	
is faring, it is clear that women’s low status with-
in the household is severely hampering progress 
in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa – the two 
regions that have consistently been rated by the 
United Nations as the world’s poorest with the 
worst health, education and shelter indicators.

The intangible dimensions of spatial inequality

Spatial inequality reaches beyond physical space constraints 
to  include  “inequality  space”.  This  specific  component  has 
a different effect across social categories such as women and 
children, ethnic groups and races, the elderly and the disabled. 
On  the  whole,  these  groups  have  been  largely  overlooked 
in  policy  discourses  on  inequality,  and  not  just  in  urban 
contexts. For example, until recently, most household surveys 
failed to capture the inequalities women have to face up to 
within the household. Although the surveys collected data on 
gender-disaggregated indicators, such as literacy among boys 
compared with girls, they did not adequately reflect girls’ or 
women’s lack of access to other resources and opportunities. 
Updated data in Demographic and Health Surveys shows that 
intra-household inequalities often take the form of a lack of 
decision-making power among women in the household.2 A 
large proportion of women in South Asia and sub-Saharan 
Africa, for instance, have no final say in decisions regarding 
their own health. (See Box 2.3.1.) 

Household  surveys  often  fail  to  capture  other  aspects  of 
“voicelessness” in women’s conditions, such as whom to marry 
and when, especially where arranged marriages are the norm. 
While gender inequality is generally understood as a central 
dimension  of  general  inequality,  social  scientists  have  been 
struggling to integrate these dimensions into mainstream data 
collection  methodologies,  partly  because  of  the  difficulties 
inherent  in  collecting  and  measuring  such  data.  Similarly, 
income inequality measures often fail to reflect racial and ethnic 
differences in access to resources. Research in India, Indonesia, 
Mexico and Tanzania shows that although in general the poor 
systematically receive lower quality health care than the rich, 
the situation is often worse for ethnic minorities. In Mexico, 
for instance, indigenous groups were shown to receive worse 
health care from both public and private providers, regardless 

of income.3 The proportion of people living in extreme poverty 
in Brazil – one of the world’s most unequal countries with 
a Gini coefficient of 0.566 – is relatively low (4.2 per cent) 
compared  with  other  middle-income  emerging  economies; 
still, poverty incidence remains linked to skin colour and area 
of residence. In 2005, poverty levels were three times higher in 
rural areas than in cities, and were particularly severe among 
Afro-descendents. Brazil’s 2007 National Monitoring Report 
indicates that blacks represented 73.5 per cent of the poorest 
10 per cent of the population, although they contributed less 
than 8 per cent of the population. 

Still in Brazil, many black and indigenous children remain 
out  of  primary  school,  and  7.5  million  people  still  live  in 
extreme poverty.4  In some cities, socially marginalized groups 
are heavily concentrated in slums, and therefore suffer most 
from lack of access to decent shelter and opportunities; this is 
especially the case when their neighbourhoods are located far 
away from the city, and the long commutes penalize them in 
terms of cost and time. In the Indian city of Jaipur, for instance, 
underprivileged (“scheduled”) castes and tribes5 contribute 61 
per cent of the slum population, although they represent only 
a combined 16.1 per cent of the total city population.6 

Results of the 2009 UN-HABITAT survey show that in all 
the 27 selected cities in the three regions under review, those 
places where the urban poor and slum dwellers earn a living 
are systematically excluded from mainstream economic, social, 
cultural and political programmes and initiatives. When asked 
to rank the most vulnerable groups in their respective cities for 
the purposes of the UN-HABITAT survey, experts reckoned 
that  along  with  the  disabled  and  the  elderly,  slum  dwellers 
and  the  urban  poor  were  the  most  vulnerable  in  terms  of 
exclusion. The economic marginalization of the urban poor 
was further evidenced by the reported length of their daily 
commutes: an average one to two hours one way, amounting 
to nearly four hours a day.

How other deprivations reinforce the spatial divide

A  significant  body  of  literature  on  income  distribution 
provides  evidence  that  inequalities  are  detrimental  to  any 
society in terms of social stability and economic inefficiency. 
High-income  groups  in  feudal  or  monopolistic  economies 
may, for instance, protect themselves from free competition 
by  buying  political  influence,  in  the  process  distorting 
markets and making democratic governance institutions less 
accountable. Highly unequal societies are also associated with 
reduced social mobility.

Whatever the various combinations of the six factors behind 
the poverty traps outlined above, they militate in favour of 
a  shift  in  emphasis  –  one  from  inequalities  in  outcomes  to 
inequalities in opportunities. This shift is critical to any proper 
understanding  not  just  of  equality  outcomes  in  any  given 
city, but also, and more importantly, of the root causes of the 
urban divide. In turn, shifting the emphasis from outcomes to 
opportunities enhances the importance of inequality on both 
normative and instrumental grounds. On normative grounds, 
inequalities  of  opportunity  are  deemed  unethical  from  the 
point  of  view  of  social  justice,  as  they  are  determined  by 
morally irrelevant circumstances. On instrumental grounds, 
inequalities  of  opportunity  are  deemed  important  from  an 
efficiency perspective, as they can have negative repercussions 
on economic performance.7 

The potential negative impact of unequal opportunities is 
also important with regard to poverty reduction, particularly 
in  developing  countries.  Whatever  the  trend  in  economic 
growth,  the  more  unequal  the  distribution  of  income  and 
the  less  the  poor  stand  to  benefit,  in  accounting  terms.8 
Inequality  might  also  be  linked  to  persistent  poverty  even 
in growth scenarios: evidence shows that greater land-related 
and  educational  inequality  reduces  income  growth  for  the 
poorest quintile about twice as much as that of all quintiles.9 
These  dynamics  might  highlight  the  positive  relationship 
between  poverty  and  inequality  across  countries,  as  shown 
in Figure 2.3.4. Specifically, countries with greater income 
inequality  (as  measured  by  the  Gini  coefficient)  tend  to 
feature  higher  incidences  of  poverty  relative  to  respective 
national poverty lines.10 

To the extent that inequality can slow down growth as it 
introduces inefficiencies in the allocation of resources, it can 
also have an indirect effect on poverty reduction. As shown 

in  Figure  2.3.5,  poverty  reduction  in  all  regions  is  closely 
associated with average annual growth in per capita income.11 
The  most  remarkable  example  is  that  of  East  Asia,  where 
high growth over the past three decades (thanks to pro-poor 
policies) has brought about substantial reductions in poverty, 
reducing the percentage of the population living on US $1.25 
or  less  from  78  per  cent  in  1981  to  17  per  cent  in  2005. 
Conversely,  those  regions  with  stagnant  or  weak  economic 
growth  and  without  clear  pro-poor  policies  have  failed  to 
achieve  significant  reductions  in  poverty:  in  sub-Saharan 
African countries, the percentage of the population living on 
US $1.25 a day has remained almost constant at around 50 
per cent over the past three decades.12 

Far from being yet another significant, specific phenomenon, 
inequality should clearly become a central focus of development 
policies.  Inequality  is  as  much  about  social  justice,  political 
freedom  and  cultural  expression  as  it  is  about  economic 
opportunities, which, in turn, determine income, wealth and 
social  standing.  Failure  to  account  for  the  social,  political, 
cultural and economic dimensions of exclusion and inequality 
results in a distribution of opportunities that is predetermined 
by unfair criteria, and only manages to entrench exclusion in a 
systematic way, to the detriment of urban growth. 

Findings  from  the  2009  UN-HABITAT  survey  point  to 
a strong correlation in the three regions between economic 
exclusiveness  on  the  one  hand,  and  social,  cultural  and 
political  equality  on  the  other.  Figure  2.3.6  illustrates  the 
four aspects of inclusiveness along a spectrum ranging from 
“not inclusive at all” (0 on the X-axis) to “highly inclusive” 
(4 on the X-axis). While, as expected, no city was found to 
be fully inclusive (rating 5), none was totally exclusive either 
(rating  1).  Most  were  concentrated  between  ratings  of  2 
(low inclusiveness) and 4 (high inclusiveness). As one would 
expect, a large number of the cities were given a rating of 3 
(denoting partial inclusiveness) for most or all four dimensions 
of  inclusiveness.  It  must  be  stressed  here  that  the  specific 
ratings for Chittagong, New Delhi, Abuja, Dakar, Mombasa, 
Oruro and Port-au-Prince indicate that the four dimensions 
are  inter-related.  Therefore,  beyond  a  confirmation  of  the 
central role of economic inclusiveness, this goes to show its 
interrelations with other forms of equality – and the need for 
cities to provide opportunities for all types of inclusiveness.

Quick Facts 

1.  Globalization can stimulate economic growth in 

cities and, with proper redistributive policies, 
help alleviate poverty. However, it can also 
exacerbate the urban divide. 

2.  About 85 per cent of all new employment 

opportunities around the world occur in the 
informal economy. 

3.  Young people in slums are more likely to 

work in the informal sector than their non-slum 
peers. Despite some advantages, informal 
employment ends up trapping slum-dwelling 
and other low-income young people in 
perpetual poverty.

4.  Among people living in poverty in the 

developing world, employment opportunities, 
whether formal or informal, are skewed in 
favour of young men, who are twice as likely to 
find gainful employment as young women. 

Policy Points 

1.  The particular ways cities are planned, 

designed and built says much about what 
is valued there, and the control of planning 
processes can help or hinder the development 
of opportunities for all. 

2.  “World class city” strategies are a legitimate 
way of taking advantage of globalization, but 
they should include a sustainable, inclusive 
dimension that also benefits the poor.

3.  Large-scale, labour-intensive infrastructure 

and urban improvement works could provide 
gainful employment to the poor while granting 
them their fair share in the “urban advantage”. 
These labour-intensive programmes are to be 
combined with vocational training and skill 
development activities. 

4.  Continued emphasis on expanding 

opportunities for girls and young women will 
be an essential requirement if the Millennium 
Development Goals are to be met in cities.

The opportunity 
Divide
When the “Urban Advantage” 
eludes the poor

Weak institutions

In  every  country  in  the  world,  access  to  the  “urban 

advantage” and distribution of the related benefits in 
terms of opportunities, employment, services, etc., is 
determined by various organizations and institutions 
– including, crucially, the formal land and labour markets as 
well as public utilities. The problem in developing countries 
is that most of these institutions are weak or dysfunctional, 
exposing them to undue influence from, or capture by, vested 
domestic or foreign interests. In some cities, necessary public 
institutions  are  lacking  altogether,  in  which  case  essentially 
private vested interests fill the void and act as substitutes for 
institutions  that  would  otherwise  prioritize  the  interests  of 
society at large. In both situations, the markets for land, basic 
services and labour are skewed in favour of private interests, 
enabling  these  to  claim  more  than  their  fair  share  of  the 
benefits of the “urban advantage”. In this process, young slum 
dwellers,  particularly  women,  are  deprived  of  the  formal, 
secure  livelihoods  that  could  lift  them  up  and  out  of  the 
dire  socioeconomic  outcomes  associated  with  the  informal, 
insecure conditions in which they are forced to live.

Inequitable and divisive land and planning policies

Institutional  capture  by  interest  group  factions  or  other 
coalitions in the developing world results in the apportionment 
to only a select few of opportunities that should be shared 
by all. The particular ways cities are planned, designed and 
built says much about what is valued there, and the control 
of planning processes can help or hinder the development of 
opportunities for all. While urban planning has the potential 
to  promote  urban  harmony  and  bridge  the  urban  divide 
through  an  equitable  distribution  of  city  amenities,  it  has 
too often been used as an instrument of exclusion. Indeed, 
powerful members of society have used “master planning” to 
capture  land  and  provide  infrastructure,  manipulating  land 
use patterns in favour of the gentrification of entire areas in 
cities. In the process, massive displacement has taken place 
to make room for highways, skyscrapers, luxury compounds 
or  shopping  malls,  to  the  detriment  of  the  habitats  and 
livelihoods of the poor. This is a worldwide phenomenon. The 
bulldozing of the vibrant slums of Maroko, Lagos, has led to

the  displacement  of  300,000  residents;  the  government-led 
destruction of Harare and Bulawayo (known as “Operation 
Murambatsvina”,  or  “drive  out  trash”)  has  been  associated 
with  large  numbers  of  arrests  and  killings,  as  well  as 
ransacking and the dislocation of more than 700,000 people; 
and in Shanghai, deliberate gentrification of neighbourhoods 
between 1991 and 1997 led to the relocation of 1.5 million 
people,  the  same  number  as  those  displaced  by  Rangoon’s 
tourism-oriented makeover. 

On top of displacing the poor, these self-serving planning 
policies  also  fail  to  provide  adequate  low-cost  housing 
alternatives,  making  them  all  the  more  inequitable.  Such 
government-  and  market-induced  actions  force  millions  to 
live  in  unsuitable,  insecure  conditions,  often  characterized 
by a lack of basic services and serious health threats. Public 
authorities  further  exacerbate  the  housing  crisis  through 
failures  on  four  major  counts:  (1)  lack  of  land  titles  and 
other forms of secure tenure; (2) cutbacks in funds for social 
housing; (3) lack of land reserves earmarked for low-income 
housing;  and  (4)  inability  to  intervene  in  the  market  to 
control land and property speculation. Furthermore, urban 
renewal  and  redevelopment  efforts  sometimes  result  in  the 
demolition  of  homes  and  relocation  of  thousands  to  areas 
which, being far removed from livelihood opportunities, result 
in further impoverishment for those already on low incomes. 
Ironically, the very “renewal” that often comes associated with 
goals as “cities without slums” can contribute to the urban 
divide,  with  all  sorts  of  inequalities  in  both  opportunities 
and  outcomes.  In  many  cities  around  the  world,  renewal 
and  redevelopment  have  caused  a  most  visible  burgeoning 
of  slums  and  inadequately  serviced  informal  settlements,

including pockets of severe poverty. Such dispossession and 
housing  distress  also  fuel  the  rise  in  homelessness  as  entire 
families find themselves forced to live on the streets for lack 
of better alternatives. These conditions deny poor people the 
benefits of the urban advantage and have serious implications 
particularly for women’s safety, health and access to education 
and employment opportunities. 

An especially divisive aspect of urbanization has been the 
recent  rapid  expansion  of  gated  communities  and  other 
protected enclaves of wealth. As more and more tracts of land 
and  civic  services  are  monopolized  by  those  with  the  most 
resources, urban amenities are systematically denied to residents 
with lower incomes. In Shanghai, for example, the advent of 
gated communities has given the better-off an opportunity to 
set up what are seen as “civilized” communities away from the 
perceived  “uncivilized”  and  much-stigmatized  underclass  of 
rural immigrants.1 In São Paulo, too, gated communities have 
increasingly given the upper class an opportunity to withdraw 
into their own enclaves, inevitably creating a contrast between 
the safe and familiar inside and a “threatening” and “unknown” 
outside.2 This trend is particularly evident in Dubai, a de facto 
if  overstretched  gated  community  rooted  in  commercial 
interests, which was deliberately built as a “global city” in a 
bid to attract upper-class investors and residents from all over 
the world. Behind the facade of luxury, though, lies a dire day-
to-day reality for thousands of Filipino, Indian and Pakistani 
immigrant workers who are barred from local citizenship (and 
related rights), housed in camps on the periphery in extremely 
precarious conditions, and subject to extensive working hours 
as well as tight and heavy social control. 
On  top  of  spatial  segregation,  gated  communities  and 
protected enclaves of wealth also result in social and economic 
segregation,  and  even  outright  social  exclusion.  In  South 
Africa,  for  example,  the  persistence  and  even  expansion  of 
gated communities is seen as the continuation of “apartheid 
geography”,  which  continues  to  separate  the  rich  and  poor 
from each other, creating an environment of exclusion that 
militates  against  the  much-lauded  post-apartheid  goals 
of  social  mixing,  integration  and  inclusion.3  Exclusive 
developments  create  a  barrier  to  interaction  among  people 
of  different  ethic  groups,  races,  religions,  cultures,  and 
classes,  inhibiting  the  construction  of  social  networks  that 
allow for social mobility and economic development.4 It also 
happens  frequently  that  gated  communities  interfere  with 
efficient urban management and civic functions by limiting 
access  to  high-quality  schools,  health-care  centres,  libraries, 
parks and other amenities. In some cases – in Johannesburg 
and  Pretoria,  for  instance  –  public  facilities  located  in  the 
vicinity  of  gated  developments  have  also  been  enclosed, 
forcing  non-residents  to  negotiate  controlled  access  points 
in  order  to  benefit  from  those  collective  services  as  part  of 
their daily routines. Moreover, public transport to enclosed, 
exclusive communities may be limited or unavailable; this is 
all the more deplorable as businesses within these communities 
frequently rely upon low-wage workers who live elsewhere, and 
therefore force them to find alternative means of transport if any.

“Global” vs. local urban advantage

As  reflected  in  the  limited  resources  available  for  good 
schooling,  health  and  other  facilities,  unequal  opportuni-
ties create “minorities in the marketplace”, whose individual 
members are automatically excluded from a wide range of the 
outcomes associated with economic growth and globalization 
–  including  demand  for  a  skilled  and  healthy  labour  force. 
Moreover, markets are not as transparent as one would assume 
and benefits do not trickle down in any automatic way, if at 
all. In most cases, government intervention is required if op-
portunities and benefits are to be fairly apportioned across the 
population. In many cities of the developing world, globaliza-
tion imposes an unfair pattern of dispensation, whereby those 
already well placed – such as government officials and the po-
litical and economic elites – benefit the most. 

Privatization of basic services

Basic  services  make  a  significant  contribution  to  the 
“urban  advantage”,  and  together  with  employment  feature 
high among the aspirations of those who move to cities in 
search of a brighter future. Economic liberalization has added 
further momentum to an ongoing trend toward privatization 
of basic utilities, including water, electricity and sanitation. 
In developing countries, private interests have often filled the 
gap left by public authorities and their inability to provide 
affordable access to such basic commodities as water, often 
putting them out of financial reach of the most vulnerable 
and marginalized segments of society. Privatization of basic 
services  (including  through  public-private  partnerships)  is 
questionable when it fails properly to consider specific criteria 
for access by the poor (such as preferential rates or subsidies). 
Globalization can stimulate economic growth in cities and, 
with  proper  redistributive  policies,  help  alleviate  poverty; 
however, globalization can also exacerbate the urban divide. 
Those  at  the  bottom  of  the  economic  scale  may  actually 
end  up  poorer,  because  while  their  incomes  may  not  have 
decreased, the gap between them and the rich has widened 
at the same time as prices of basic services and facilities are 
becoming more expensive with privatization. As stressed in 
Chapter 2.5, environmental equity is an essential determinant 
of health and mortality, especially for the urban poor. This is 
why  access  to  basic  services  like  water  and  sanitation  plays 
a  crucial  role  in  poverty  reduction  and  the  improvement 
in  slum-dwellers’  living  conditions,  as  mandated  under  the 
Millennium Development Goals.

From a human rights perspective, critical evaluations of the 
recent privatization of basic services have drawn three major 
lessons: 
1. By  its  very  nature,  privatization  is  increasingly  forcing 
public authorities (both central and local) to become more 
profit-oriented in the provision of essential services. Among 
developing nations, where a significant proportion of the 
population lives in poverty, many segments of society are 
in no position to guarantee sufficient or adequate rates of 

return  to  the  shareholders  of  the  private  companies  now 
providing basic services. Therefore, unless the rates charged 
by  those  utilities  are  subsidized  in  some  way  or  another, 
already  underprivileged  people  will  likely  be  forced  to 
forego basic services altogether. 

2. Private corporate entities place strong emphasis on profit 
generation and cost recovery, which often has the effect of 
fragmenting service scope and delivery. If no potential or 
actual user can pay the full price for the new services, the 
project may become financially unsustainable. 

3. Private operators are accountable to investors rather than 
to  the  communities  they  serve.  Of  particular  concern 
are  the  growing  incidences  of  unethical  practices  by 
private  suppliers  and  other  institutions  that  aggressively 
push  for  increased  privatization.  The  need  to  strengthen 
participatory monitoring mechanisms could not be more 
acute,  since  privatization  is  extremely  difficult  to  reverse 
once effective.5

Displacing the urban poor to create “world-class” cities

In the developing world, global economic forces have led 
to fierce competition among conurbations to become “world-
class” cities, namely, cities that generate high rates of profitabil-
ity through provision of high-quality international financial, 
professional and business services. Major cities are jockeying 
for “world-class” status at the same time that the demonstrat-
ed effects of global economic flows and international policy 
constraints appear to be rather mixed. Global economic in-
vestment creates new and unprecedented sources of wealth, 
offering the promise of reduced poverty and broader access 
to basic services; however, the fact remains that, within cities, 
extreme poverty persists in a significant way. The raw numbers 
of people enjoying better, more secure conditions, with access 
to potable water, improved sanitation and sustainable liveli-
hoods have increased as a result of economic prosperity and 
redistributive  policies;  but  some  of  the  policy  prescriptions 
that have been imposed on developing country governments 
to promote their integration into global economic flows are 
not necessarily oriented to redistribution. Instead, they tend to 
restrict government involvement in the provision of adequate 
resources and services that are often of critical importance to 
large majorities of their populations. Economic liberalization 
is one of the factors behind the continuing deterioration in 
the education, health, housing and related services on which a 
majority of the urban poor depend. 

Against  this  background  of  persistent  inequality,  aspiring 
“world-class”  cities  take  advantage  of  the  improvements  in 
global connectivity that have facilitated a dramatic expansion 
in  cross-border  networks  and  flows  of  goods,  services  and 
finance.6 Some new world-class cities are emerging – or are 
scheduled to emerge – in the developing world in such specific 
areas  as  science,  technology,  financial  management,  and 
knowledge. These cities often find themselves at the core of 
new mega-regions, city-regions or urban corridors, attracting 
both  capital  expenditure  and  workers  (see  Chapter  1.1).  As

part  of  broader  growth  and  development  strategies,  aiming 
for  world-class  status  makes  sense  for  cities:  such  efforts 
demonstrate  entrepreneurial  capacity,  creativity,  ambition 
and  a  political  determination  to  enhance  a  city’s  potential. 
However,  problems  consistently  arise  when  ambitious 
projects and policies are deployed at the expense or even to 
the  detriment  of  the  poor,  without  authentically  engaging 
them in decisions that affect their lives. 

This report argues that short of a sustainable vision, there 
can  be  no  inclusive  cities.  A  sustainable  vision,  almost  by 
definition,  combines  optimism,  ambition  and  innovation, 
but  it  must  also  be  realistic  and  holistic,  encompassing  all 
segments of the city population. Some of the grand plans for 
“world-class” cities are exclusionary, tending to overlook poor 
and marginalized populations from the design stage through 
the final outcome. In other cases, though, planning has taken 
into  account  the  whole  urban  population  from  inception, 
deliberately ushering in a more equitable, spatially integrated 
city.  For  instance,  the  “Kuala  Lumpur  City  Plan  2020” 
prioritizes  not  just  economic  prosperity  and  environmental 
quality,  but  also  social  equity.  The  plan  is  shaped  by  social 
concerns and aims to make the city more inclusive.7 Likewise, 
the  “Joburg  2030  Vision”  scheme  that  was  first  developed 
in  2001  has  since  been  revisited,  with  the  “Growth  and 
Development  Strategy  2006  (“Joburg  GDS”),  to  integrate 
some dimensions of social and economic inclusiveness that 
had been overlooked early on. As it stands now, the Joburg 
GDS stresses the need for more extensive opportunities for 
all in the economic sector, in a bid to address any remaining 
inequalities  that  have  been  identified.  The  new  city  vision 
clearly  states  that  “…the  benefits  of  balanced  economic 
growth will be shared in a way that enables all residents to 
gain access to the ladders of prosperity, and where the poor, 
vulnerable and excluded will be supported out of poverty to 
realize upward social mobility…”8

Laws and administrative policies 

The  persistence  of  discriminatory  legislation,  such  as 
anti-vagrancy  and  anti-beggary  laws,  combines  with  other 
methods – interpretation of criminal law, anti-squatting laws, 
misuse of anti-terrorist laws, new surveillance strategies and 
“zero-tolerance” policies – to add to the marginalization of 
vulnerable  groups,  such  as  the  homeless,  and  even  openly 
turn them into declared targets. For example, India’s Bombay 
Prevention of Beggary Act 1959 is routinely used to round 
up the homeless, even when they are gainfully employed. For 
municipal authorities, the problem also has to do with budget 
constraints  and  choices.  In  Buenos  Aires,  the  Municipal 
Housing  Institute  had  to  cut  its  budgetary  allocation  by 
nearly four from 519 to 120 million pesos (US $137 to 32 
million) in 2009; concomitantly, over the past five years, the 
city’s municipal security (i.e., police) budget has undergone a 
tenfold increase.9

Today, various urban areas in developing countries suffer 
from unemployment rates that are similar to those experienced 
in  the  cities  that  were  most  severely  affected  by  the  Great 
Depression  in  the  United  States  of  America.10  The  only 
difference is that in the developing world, the prospects for 
cities to solve the unemployment issues they face in the short 
or medium terms are poor, making these problems chronic. 
For instance, Johannesburg reported unemployment rates of 
33 per cent in 2005 and 30 per cent in 2007,11 which are 
higher than those in Chicago when the city bore the brunt of 
the depression in the 1930s. Local and national governments 
together can design a number of programmes and schemes to 
open up opportunities for all. This can include cash transfers, 
support  aid  programmes  and  targeted  social  interventions 
or specific support to the labour market in order to generate 
jobs. In this section, we refer more specifically to employment 
creation, as opposed to the other redistribution alternatives 
that are addressed in Chapter 3.3 of this Report.

Employment: A mis-shared urban advantage 

In the dreams of all those who move there, cities foster the 
healthy development of children and young people, providing 
easier access to education, health care and employment than 
is  available  in  rural  areas.  As  they  soon  find  out,  though, 
not all who grow up in cities benefit from this other major 
component of the “urban advantage”, because no city offers 
all  children  and  young  people  a  single,  undivided  urban 
condition.12  Cities  can  generate  and  intensify  the  kind  of 
social  exclusion  that  denies  most  of  the  up-and-coming 
generation  and  other  marginalized  groups  the  benefits  of 
urban  life,  particularly  against  a  contrasted  background  of 
unprecedented  urban  growth  and  increasing  poverty  and 
inequality. Indeed, these two opposite trends can be found to 
coexist within the confines of a single city.

Developing  and  developed  countries  alike  face  an 
employment  crisis,  but  the  causes  are  different.  While  in 
developed countries, the scarcity of jobs is a consequence of 
the recent financial and economic crunch, in the developing 
world  unemployment  is  endemic  and  the  global  financial 
crisis  is  only  making  it  even  worse.  In  most  developing 
countries,  the  working-age  population  is  growing  much 
faster than new, gainful employment opportunities. Most of 
these countries are experiencing an “employment transition”, 
with more and more people seeking non-agricultural work, 
and  mainly  in  urban  areas.  This  is  part  of  the  general 
industrial trends in Africa, Asia and Latin America as they 
move  to  manufacturing-based  economies,  while  those 
countries  that  had  already  reached  that  stage  are  moving 
toward high technology and services. Some cities and regions 
(for instance, Bangalore and New Delhi in India) are moving 
straight  from  agriculture-based  to  high-technology  and 
services  provision  without  any  significant  manufacturing 

transition to speak of, contrary to the established historical 
pattern.  Unconventional  or  not,  though,  these  economic 
transitions  come  as  a  major  socio-economic  challenge  for 
urban  areas,  insofar  as  they  have  been  unable  to  generate 
sufficient  numbers  of  durable  job  opportunities  in  the 
manufacturing or service sectors that could provide gainful 
employment to people migrating from rural areas. In a sharp 
contrast  to  the  North,  urbanization  in  many  developing 
countries  has  taken  place  without  commensurate  increases 
in  productive  employment  or  increases  in  agricultural 
productivity  that  could  sustain  rural  areas  while  feeding 
cities at more affordable prices for all.

In  addition  to  the  endemic  job  crisis,  most  developing 
countries  have  had  to  deal  with  the  consequences  of  the 
financial  and  economic  crisis  that  since  2008  has  caused 
significant  labour  market  deterioration  in  all  parts  of  the 
world. The risk is that this deterioration may, in turn, trigger 
serious social and political tension in a number of countries. 
In a recent analysis, the International Labour Organization 
(ILO)  suggested  that  the  crisis  might  be  much  deeper 
and  broader,  and  might  last  much  longer,  than  initially 
anticipated.13 However, the pace and nature of its impact varies 
quite significantly across regions and countries depending on 
economic structure, policy constraints and other specificities. 
Some countries are more vulnerable than others, particularly 
those  where  people  on  low  incomes  are  heavily  dependent 
on remittances from abroad. From a more general point of 
view, the ongoing crisis is likely to reverse any modest gains 
many developing countries had been making lately in terms 
of growth, poverty reduction and job creation. The resulting 
significant effects may outlast the crisis.

Youth employment: The gender divide

Even  before  the  global  financial  crisis  began  to  affect 
the  developing  world,  data  on  urban  young  people’s 
access  to  education  and  livelihoods  showed  that  against  a 
general  background  of  persistent  deprivation  and  endemic 
unemployment, the benefits of the “urban advantage” eluded 
some specific groups, and women in particular. Girls and young 
women  living  in  poverty  in  cities  consistently  face  steeper 
challenges than their male peers when it comes to acquiring 
the knowledge and skills they need to live healthy, productive 
lives. Continued emphasis on expanded opportunities for girls 
and young women, therefore, will be an essential requirement 
if the Millennium Development Goals are to be met in cities. 
Young  slum  dwellers  are  more  likely  to  have  a  child,  be 
married or head a household than their counterparts in non-
slum areas – a phenomenon that acts as a further challenge to 
female access to the “urban advantage”. The majority of young 
female slum dwellers tend to bear children at an earlier age 
than their non-slum counterparts: this is the case in Uganda, 
where six out 10 young women living in slums have a child 
or are married, or twice as many as in non-slum communities 
(by comparison, 34 per cent of young Ugandans in slum areas 
head a household, compared with 5 per cent of those in non-
slum areas.) In many places, young women serve as unpaid 
carers of children or other family members. 

All  these  situations  combine  to  make  young  women 
particularly likely to stay out of the income-earning workforce 
and  miss  out  on  opportunities  for  decent,  durable  gainful 
employment.  Those  women  who  do  work  in  developing 
countries  tend  to  do  so  in  the  informal  economy,  owing 
to  lack  of  formal  job  opportunities  in  many  regions.  For 
example,  in  Dhaka  most  of  the  jobs  performed  by  women 
in  garment  and  textile  or  food  processing  firms  are  of  an 

informal nature, although many of them are the main bread-
earners for their families. In the absence of organized labour 
markets, only small numbers of women have access to formal 
employment with the associated benefits (social security, paid 
and  parental  leave,  retirement  and  unemployment  money); 
instead,  most  women  find  themselves  dependent  upon  the 
informal economy for their own and their family’s survival. 
In  sub-Saharan  Africa,  84  per  cent  of  women’s  non-
agricultural  employment  is  informal.  Few  are  employed 
in  the  formal  economy,  and  those  who  do  are  frequently 
confined  to  “traditionally  female”,  or  “pink  collar”,  jobs 
with the low status, poor job security and low pay typically 
shunned by men. In some areas, however, women and men 
are competing for low-status jobs in sales and other services. 
Women also fall victims to discriminatory stereotyping, or to 
the fact that family responsibilities make them less available 
for full-time employment. 

As far as youth non-employment is concerned (an ingrained, 
endemic phenomenon), rates are also generally much higher 
for females than males. Non-employment refers to situations 
that are typical of countries with poor labour market structures, 
where  a  young  working-age  individual  is  neither  at  school 
nor employed or formally registered as a job-seeker. In most 
African countries, the female non-employment rate is around 
40 per cent, or twice as much as for males. By comparison, 
in  those  countries  where  the  labour  market  is  formal  and 
well-organized,  the  unemployment  rates  of  both  young 
women  and  men  are  quite  similar;  in  less  organized  labour 
markets, unemployment tends to be under-reported and data 
collection is difficult. For instance, in Quito, the official rate of 
unemployment is around 7 per cent, but the experts surveyed 
reckon the actual figure to be some three times higher. They 
also estimate that in the Ecuadoran capital, under-employment 
affects 45 per cent of the working population.14

The informal sector: Gateway or trap for youth?

In  developing  countries,  confinement  of  slum-dwelling 
women to largely informal jobs provides a stark illustration of 
a wider phenomenon whereby the formal, secure livelihoods 
that  typically  accompany  the  “urban  advantage”  elude  too 
many  among  the  urban  population.  In  most  developing 
countries, trends suggest that urban economies have become 
increasingly  informal  over  the  past  10  years,  as  the  formal 
sector  consistently  fails  to  provide  for  both  young  people 
and adults seeking employment, even in the face of healthy 
economic growth. In India, for example, whose economy grew 
at a 5 per cent annual rate over the past 10 years, some 370 
million people, or 9 out of 10 employees, are not affiliated 
with any formal social security scheme. Mexico, which grew 
an average 2.5 per cent per year in the past 10 years, extends 
social security to only 30 per cent of its workforce. 

About  85  per  cent  of  all  new  employment  opportunities 
around  the  world  occur  in  the  informal  economy,  but 
this  is  not  without  some  beneficial  effects.  For  the  young, 
these  include  opportunities  for  work  experience  and  self-
employment. Part-time, seasonal and contract work in both 
the formal and informal economies also counts as informal 
employment. Tracking the number of young people employed 
in the informal sector is a challenge for a number of reasons, 
though,  and  currently  available  data  is  inadequate.15  UN-
HABITAT analysis suggests that the majority of young people 
working in the urban informal sector live in slum areas. For 
example,  in  Benin,  slum  dwellers  comprise  75  per  cent  of 
informal sector workers, while in Burkina Faso, the Central 
African  Republic,  Chad  and  Ethiopia,  the  proportion  is  as 
large as 90 per cent. 

With  its  combination  of  job  insecurity,  low  wages  and 
dangerous work, the informal sector should provide no more 
than a short-term solution to urban unemployment. Formal job 
creation can be so scarce, though, that informal employment 
ends up trapping slum-dwelling and other low-income young 
people in perpetual poverty. With the financial and economic 
crisis, job losses are also pushing more people deeper into the 
informal economy or outright poverty. As construction projects 
are interrupted, for example, builders lose their jobs and the 
street vendors who served them lose customers. A slowdown 
in tourist and other leisure activities also has repercussions for 
the informal sector. These are the losses that unemployment 
statistics fail to capture – and that are likely to be overlooked 
in efforts to stimulate new employment.

Unemployment, the informal sector, slums and instability 

The  current  economic  downturn  makes  employment 
prospects for young urban dwellers all the more worrisome 
as  the  issues  related  to  their  specific  segment  of  the  labour 
market  had  never  been  addressed  during  previous,  more 
prosperous years. The upcoming generations continue to suffer 
disproportionately  from  a  scarcity  of  decent  employment 
opportunities. This scarcity is the primary cause of poverty and 

social instability. In the developing world, the lack of decent, 
sustainable  jobs  promotes  a  sense  of  displacement  among 
the young. This can lead to crime, under-development and a 
cycle of poverty, potentially feeding political and ideological 
unrest and inciting violence.16 The risk is especially significant 
in those many countries where demographic patterns exhibit 
so-called  “youth  bulges”,  when  young  people  comprise  at 
least 40 per cent of the population. The majority of criminal 
offences  around  the  world  are  committed  by  youth  aged 
between 12 and 25. Young people’s resentment of their own 
limited opportunities and their place in society can also give 
rise to public displays of frustration and violence: in 2005, the 
French riots over employment conditions for school leavers 
underscored the volatility of the up-and-coming generations 
when they feel marginalized. 

The  persistence  of  the  urban  informal  sector  and  the 
expansion of urban slums point to the pressing need for well-
adapted  employment  policies.17  The  2009  UN-HABITAT 
survey suggests that what is happening is quite the opposite, 
though:  in  too  many  cities  of  the  developing  world,  and 
regardless  of  the  specific  target  set  by  the  Millennium 
Development  Goals,  slum  areas  remain  a  “blind  spot” 
when  it  comes  to  policy  interventions,  job  creation  and 
youth support. For many of the working poor, low incomes 
in  the  face  of  rising  land  prices  virtually  rule  them  out  of 
access to land, in the process encouraging the persistence or 
expansion  of  slums.  In  the  absence  of  effective  institutions 
or  policies,  if  any  at  all,  cities  are  essentially  being  built 
“back to front”,18 as land development takes place before the 
formulation,  enactment  and  implementation  of  planning 
strategies and control mechanisms: the urban poor lead this 
process whereby building comes first (admittedly, as a matter 
of emergency), with servicing and regularizing only at some 
later, undetermined stage.

Facing  up  to  the  global  crisis:  Youth  employment  in  the 
development agenda

Unemployment is the one option that many of the urban 
poor cannot afford. They frequently have no savings and cannot 
fall back on social security. A large proportion of workers in 
developing  economies  have  no  alternative  when  economic 
conditions deteriorate and the cost of living increases: they 
must work even more, picking up any available job regardless 
of terms and conditions. Such circumstances are not captured 
in official statistics. Higher unemployment rates will continue 
to  reflect  the  current  crisis,  though  only  to  a  point;  at  the 
same time, more and more people will be joining the ranks of 
the insecure working poor in developing economies.

Youth  employment  features  high  on  the  development 
agenda. The international community formally recognizes the 
importance of providing opportunities for income generation 
among  young  people:  Millennium  Development  Goal  8, 
target 16, calls on rich nations to enter into partnerships with 
developing countries to devise and deploy strategies for decent 
and  productive  work  for  youth.  For  the  purposes  of  these

The “urban advantage” refers to the abundance

and social opportunities to pursuits of a political,

urban  advantage  includes  the  four  dimensions 
of inclusiveness – economic, social, political and 
cultural – which coincide with the basic compo-
nents  of  individual  and  collective  development 
and well-being.

this	type	of	approach	looks	to	make	effective	the	
whole range of universally recognized fundamen-

Monetary measures of inequality – income and 
the consumption of various household goods and 
services	–	reveal	little	about	the	specific	depri-
vations  people  experience  in  different  places, 
and	this	recognition	has	prompted	fresh	thinking	
about the best ways of capturing the complexity 
of the forces behind inequality. Researchers are 
now	looking	beyond	the	Gini	coefficient	to	focus	
on measures of unequal opportunity. 

As developed recently by experts at the World 
Bank	 and	 institutions	 in	 several	 Latin	 American	
countries,  the  Human  Opportunity  Index  (HOI) 
measures	the	likelihood	that	children	from	differ-
ent	backgrounds,	or	in	different	combinations	of	
circumstances, will be able to access the basic 
services they need. By synthesizing measures of 
both the opportunities available to children, in the 
form of the general provision of various services 
in an area, and the equitable distribution of those 
services, the opportunity index provides a holistic 
picture	of	how	level	the	playing	field	is	for	people	
from	 different	 social	 backgrounds.	 This	 type	 of	
measurement	is	of	significant	value	to	public	au-
thorities, as it points out precisely where policy 
interventions could be most effective; more gen-
erally, the index has the merit of highlighting the 

ways in which inequalities of opportunity affect 
peoples’ life chances.

The HOI is a composite indicator that summarizes 
provision and accessibility of basic opportunities 
related to education and housing, based on mea-
sures such as timely completion of sixth grade, 
school attendance at ages 10 to 14, and access 
to clean water, sanitation and electricity. On top 
of	other	composite	measures	of	well-being	–	first	
and  foremost,  the  Human  Development  Index 
(HDI), which synthesizes average literacy, life ex-
pectancy and income – the really novel element 
the  HOI  introduces  is  a  focus  on  potential  op-
portunities.  Together  with  government  policies, 
labour	markets,	and	myriad	other	factors	such	as	
trade	union	affiliation	and	political	participation,	
these  potential  opportunities  determine  mea-
surable effects, such as income and the way it 
is distributed. Ability to anticipate potential op-
portunities	places	researchers	and	policymakers	
alike	in	a	better	position	to	understand	the	forces	
at	work	that	hinder	the	chances	for	some	social	
groups	to	fulfil	their	potential.

In	the	first	practical	application	of	the	Human	Op-
portunity  Index  in  2005,  researchers  calculated

countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. As 
noted earlier in this report, inequalities are more 
pronounced  and  pervasive  in  that  region  than 
anywhere	else	in	the	world.	The	results	identified	
widespread differences across countries, both in 
terms of education and housing and in relation to 
the	overall	composite	index	summarizing	all	five	
variables. As shown in the table below, several 
countries,  including  Chile,  Jamaica,  Argentina 
and Mexico, were found to provide broad-based 
access to education opportunities, while others, 
such  as  Guatemala,  Nicaragua  and  Honduras, 
were  in  need  of  substantial  improvement.  In 
terms  of  housing  conditions,  Costa  Rica,  Chile, 
Argentina and Venezuela were at the forefront, 
with Nicaragua, Honduras and Bolivia lagging be-
hind.  The  overall  composite  index  showed  that 
in 2005, Chile was where equality of opportunity 
was at its best in the sample. This is hardly sur-
prising, given the country’s sustained efforts to 
target public services, including housing, to the 
poor and other vulnerable groups.

Unequal access to opportunities cannot be justi-
fied	from	a	moral	or	ethical	standpoint,	but	the	
fact  remains  that  the  bundle  of  opportunities 
available	 to	 any	 individual	 begins	 taking	 shape	
even before they are born. Whether a child will 
have access to clean water, education, medical 
care,	let	alone	to	life	in	the	first	place,	is	largely	
determined  by  circumstances  that  are  beyond 
their control. A combination of race and ethnicity, 
the incomes and education of a child’s parents, 
and the child’s place of birth – whether a rural or 
an urban area, a slum or a wealthier neighbour-
hood – will largely determine not just the child’s 
probability	 of	 surviving	 their	 first	 year,	 but	 also	
their  future  prospects.  Given  the  rather  deter-
ministic nature of birth circumstances, it is hardly 
surprising  that  measurable  outcomes,  such  as 
poverty,	 persist	 across	 generations	 for	 identifi-
able sub-sets of the population, insofar as they 
are rooted in racial or other types of discrimina-
tion, or in inequitable access to basic opportuni-
ties such as health and education. 

However, family circumstances are only one part 
of  the  equation;  exclusionary  political  systems 
(such  as  colonialism  and  apartheid)  have  also 
been shown severely to hamper equality of op-
portunity, even after these regimes were disman-
tled and after several years under less repressive 
governments. Many researchers have suggested 
that inequality persists in these countries because 
colonial or racist regimes handed power over to 
local  elites  who  only  extended  the  exclusionary 
systems and policies of their former oppressors.

partnerships, as for any other efforts to generate dignified and 
legitimate employment opportunities, two factors militate in 
favour of targeting urban youth living in poverty, as suggested 
by the recent UN-HABITAT survey data: (1) young people in 
slums are more likely to work in the informal sector than their 
non-slum  peers,  and  (2)  informal  sector  jobs  provide  little 
financial security, or chances to access well-paid employment 
in the future.

If  youth  employment  is  to  be  addressed  in  any  effective 
way, four elements must be taken into consideration: young 
people’s employability, equal opportunities for jobs, entrepre-
neurship opportunities, and employment creation strategies. 
Employability  is  an  outgrowth  of  education  and  economic 
development; any efforts to promote equity should investi-
gate whether young women and men benefit from the same 
opportunities; efforts to encourage youth-run enterprises can 
ensure that young people develop skills for the benefit of lo-
cal communities. It is for public policies to pave the way for 
new employment opportunities for youth. Beyond enhanced 
skills, public and private sector partners must keep job crea-
tion as a central concern of their capital investment strategies. 
It is also high time to promote local economic development 
based on a participatory process that encourages partnerships 
between  the  main  private  and  public  stakeholders,  as  part 
of joint pro-poor and pro-employment urban development 
strategies; these should make use of local resources and com-
petitive advantage in a global set-up, with the final objective 
of creating decent jobs and stimulating economic activity.19 

Efforts to share the “urban advantage” more equitably with 
young job-seekers should go hand in hand with support for 
the informal sector, where most of the urban poor work in 
low-paid,  low-productivity  and  low-security  jobs.  Local 
authorities should adjust laws and regulations to lower the 
costs and increase the benefits for those willing to formalize 
their  businesses.  Local  authorities  should  also  provide 
assistance  to  small  enterprises,  enabling  them  to  upgrade 

skills and improve access to both productive resources and 
market opportunities.

Jobs through state-built infrastructure for all

On  top  of  the  policy  recommendations  above,  another 
broad  type  of  initiative  can  generate  both  decent  jobs  and 
socially inclusive growth that benefits the vulnerable and the 
working poor. It is for individual governments to explore these 
avenues and build them into economic stimulus policies. The 
suggestion  is  to  generate  more  formal  employment  through 
rehabilitation  and  construction  of  physical  infrastructure, 
such  as  roads,  bridges,  schools  and  hospitals,  including 
upgraded  social  care  and  community  centres.  Given  the 
current scarcity of financial capital, these schemes should best 
be  labour-based.  Labour-intensive  approaches  have  become 
an important element of job creation strategies in many low-
wage developing countries, in the process taking advantage of 
substantial reserves of underused labour, and they are relevant 
in developed countries as well. While it takes time for major 
capital-intensive  new  infrastructure  projects  to  result  in 
additional employment, labour-based approaches can generate 
jobs and much-needed infrastructure in shorter timeframes. 

Such  massive  mobilization  of  available  local  workforces 
could provide low-income and slum-dwelling women, young 
and other vulnerable people with a wide range of amenities 
and  services,  including  clean  and  safe  community  centres, 
support  for  early  childhood  development  programmes 
and  eldercare,  new  uses  of  public  spaces  for  cultural  and 
educational  programmes,  repair  of  rural  road  networks,  or 
irrigation networks, among others. 

In  the  medium  term,  these  labour-intensive  programmes 
are to be combined with vocational training and skill devel-
opment activities. After eluding them for so long, the “urban 
advantage” would finally become a tangible reality for many 
marginalized urban dwellers, and through their own efforts.

The Social Divide
Impact on Bodies and Minds

Invalidated hopes

The economic divide does more than deprive the 

poor  of  the  land  tenure,  proper  shelter,  basic 
utilities  and  dignified  employment  that  are 
typically associated with the “urban advantage” 
and to which they are entitled. Beyond the functional goods 
and  services  that  provide  for  decent  living  conditions,  the 
repercussions  of  poverty  can  reach  into  life  in  its  most 
physical and social dimensions. In urban areas, the endemic 
hunger and malnutrition caused by inequitable distribution 
of largely available food resources are so debilitating for the 
poor  as  to  invalidate  hopes  for  improved  opportunities  in 
the  future.  Inequitable  distribution  of  basic  services  across 
urban areas has the same debilitating physical effect on low-
income households, who are exposed to more health hazards 
than the better-off that can afford water, sanitation and waste 
disposal services. 

Hunger  and  poor  health  feed  on  each  other.  Their 
physical  repercussions  are  ingrained  from  infancy  onwards, 
affecting the development and opportunities of the younger 
generations.  Disease  adds  to  economic  pressures  on  the 
poor, and so do the costs of children’s schooling – although 
education is known for improving general health and reducing 
poverty.  This  is  how  the  physical  and  intellectual  potential 
of millions of young urban dwellers is impaired, dilapidated 
or  denied  for  lack  of  equitable  distributive  policies.  This 
unfair  dispensation  is  frequently  more  detrimental  to  girls, 
although they are the privileged vectors of healthy bodies and 
minds from one generation to another. The ongoing global 
economic crisis can only compound the hard choices urban 
poor families are left facing nowadays–food to survive the day, 
but no health care to survive tomorrow, and no school to pave 
the way for the future.

Quick Facts 
  hunger in Cities

1.  Hunger is endemic in many poor urban areas 

of the developing world and the food crisis can 
only compound the situation. 

2.  The food crisis is often not one of supply, but 

access. 

3.  The doubling of global food prices over the last 

three years could potentially push 100 million 
people in low-income countries deeper into 
poverty. 

  The health Divide

1.  In urban slums, shelter deprivations and 

environmental risks combine to hinder 
people’s ability to escape hunger, and 
exposure to infectious illnesses creates a 
vicious cycle where children are constantly 
malnourished. 

2.  Indoor air pollution is a “quiet” and overlooked 

killer, and lack of global awareness is one 
of the primary obstacles to the widespread 
implementation of existing, proven responses.

  education: opportunities and Inequalities

1.  The education system perpetuates and 

reproduces social inequalities.

2.  In the poor areas of many African cities, 
primary school enrolment is decreasing. 

3.  Efforts to improve the education of girls in 
some countries have resulted in significant 
increases and progress in female enrolment 
and narrowing the gender gap, but male 
enrolment is regressing in some cities in 
various regions.

Poverty and hunger: The nutritional divide 

Hunger  has,  for  a  long  time,  been  considered  a  rural 
phenomenon,  mostly  related  to  the  availability  of  produce 
depending on weather and other factors. The assumption that 
food security is much more tenuous for rural agriculturalists 
than city residents has been based primarily on the persistence 
of a rural/urban dichotomy, which holds that residents of one 
area live fundamentally different lives from those in the other. 
Many  country  reports  and  publications  from  international 
agencies indeed show higher rates of malnutrition in rural than 
in urban areas; however, various studies show that hunger can 
be found in urban areas, too. The relatively low prevalence of 
malnutrition in urban areas, as measured by the incidence of 
underweight children, conceals significant differences in food 
security across socioeconomic groups; this low prevalence also 
conceals  the  fact  that  poverty  can  have  remarkably  similar 
practical effects in urban and in rural areas. 

In  market  economies,  cities  are  characterized  by  “relative 
inequality”,  where  poverty  is  not  absolute  but  rather  is 
measured by the gaps in opportunities and resources between 
the  poor  and  the  rich  living  in  a  segmented  environment. 
In  urban  areas,  disposable  income  and  food  prices  largely 
determine  the  amounts  and  types  of  foods  consumed  by 
poor urban families, whereas in rural areas it is largely left to 
cropping patterns and the timing and quality of the harvest 
to  determine  food  availability  for  subsistence  farmers.  The 
relative differences in income and wealth are much less stark 
among rural than urban residents. In urban areas, the higher 
purchasing power of the rich contributes to inflation of food 
and health care costs, making these unaffordable for the poor. 
For the urban poor, hunger originates with the sheer lack of 
money  to  purchase  food  that  is  adequate  both  in  quantity 
and quality.1 Even when a country produces enough food to 
sustain its whole population, hunger may remain a persistent 
problem among poor urban populations if the available food 
commands  prices  that  they  cannot  afford.  In  urban  areas, 
hunger, just as poverty, is only the outcome of an inequitable 
distribution of available resources. 

Unequal  access  to  food  and  other  basic  needs  exposes 
poor  populations  to  a  host  of  diseases.  The  data  presented 
here  shows  that  hunger  is  endemic  among  both  the  urban 
poor and rural populations of many countries in Africa, Asia 
and Latin America and the Caribbean.2 Ultimately, poverty 
afflicts  populations  in  both  urban  and  rural  environments 
with ill health and limited life chances. However, those living 
in urban slums and squatter settlements frequently have to 
endure worse conditions than their rural relatives, with the 
children  in  the  poorest  urban  income  bracket  experiencing 
malnutrition  at  more  than  twice  the  rate  of  those  in  the 
richest income category.3

Policy Points 
  hunger in Cities

1.  The structural food crises the urban poor 
experience on an ongoing basis call for 
fundamental policy remedies, including 
production, marketing, distribution, handling 
and control of food for the urban market.

2.  The food crisis will be long-term and the worst 

is yet to come for the most vulnerable unless 
extraordinary measures are taken to help them.

  The health Divide

1.  The fight against childhood ill-health must take 
in the modern environment of disease, namely, 
the local neighbourhood and the city as a 
whole. 

2.  Policymakers can help alleviate health 

inequalities in poor urban areas with 
comprehensive primary care and better access 
to healthy food.

3.  Slum upgrading and the sustainability of health 
and nutrition programmes are linked and they 
should be part of integrated slum upgrading 
initiatives.

  education: opportunities and Inequalities

1.  If school enrolment and achievement are to be 

improved in underprivileged urban areas, a 
combination of incentives that stimulates both 
demand and supply is required. 

2.  Improvements in girls’ enrolment have resulted 

from various interrelated strategies that may 
provide some insights into ways of keeping 
boys in school.

3.  Most national and international literacy and 
education programmes so far have focused 
on reducing the urban/rural gap in education, 
overlooking the divide between rich and poor 
prevailing in urban areas.

Lessons from countries in continuous and structural 
food crisis 

For  many  developing  countries,  the  current  food  crisis 
is  not  unprecedented.  In  many  places  food  insecurity  has 
affected the daily lives of urban poor and rural families for 
at least the past two decades, with hunger and both chronic 
and acute malnutrition remaining matters of serious concern. 
Children are often born into hunger, grow up in hunger and 
die  in  hunger.  Malnutrition  starts  during  pregnancy,  when 
women suffering from anaemia and other complications do 
not  receive  proper  antenatal  care.  In  urban  areas,  children 
from deprived households are often severely malnourished, at 
times to the point where immune systems are suppressed and 
the risk of disease is high. 

As  part  of  its  Monitoring  Urban  Inequities  Programme 
(MUIP),  UN-HABITAT  has  made  a  fresh  review  of 
Demographic  and  Health  Survey  data  collected  between 
1990 and 2007 in various countries in Africa, Asia and Latin 
America  and  the  Caribbean.  Analysis  reveals  that  serious 
malnutrition  has  been  widespread  in  these  regions’  urban 
slums and rural areas since 1990, regardless of the local food 
crisis situation.4 The data highlights serious malnutrition in 
the African countries of Burkina Faso, Benin, Chad, Central 
African Republic, Malawi, Mali, Mozambique, Niger, Nigeria, 
Rwanda, Tanzania,  Uganda  and  Zambia,  where  more  than 
four out of 10 children suffered from stunted development 
resulting from malnutrition throughout the survey years. For 
instance,  Niger  featured  high  proportions  of  children  with 
stunted development in both poor urban and rural areas for 
the years 1992, 1998 and 2006. In Asia, these proportions 
were the highest in Bangladesh, India and Nepal, with more 
than four out of 10 children in Bangladesh malnourished in 
survey years 1996, 1999 and 2004. In India, similarly high 
proportions of malnourished children were observed in 1992, 
1998 and 2005. In Latin America and the Caribbean, high 
rates  of  malnutrition  were  observed  in  Bolivia,  Guatemala 
and  Haiti,  where  stunted  development  affected  three  to 
five out of 10 children. The two Demographic and Health 
Surveys  conducted  in  Guatemala  in  1995  and  1998  show 
high, though decreasing, proportions of children with stunted 
development among the urban poor, at 61 per cent in 1995 
and 49 per cent in 1998. 

The data also shows that malnutrition in most poor urban 
and rural areas has remained serious over time, sometimes more 
than 20 times the 2.3 per cent rate expected in healthy, well-
nourished children. These extremely high rates have occurred 
against  a  background  of  adverse  longer-term  trends  and 
structural vulnerability associated with the living conditions 
in both slums and rural areas. This is why, for instance, several 
authors  have  suggested  that  the  2005  food  crisis  in  Niger 
has been misinterpreted as a unique phenomenon resulting 
from a large shock, although the situation was exacerbated by 
relatively moderate production and price shocks.5

Poverty and hunger coexist across human settlement types 

As mentioned earlier, children in the poorest income brack-
ets are malnourished at twice the rate of their counterparts in 
the richest ones. Even in many countries with serious mal-
nutrition, children from rich families are much less affected 
than those from lower-income households. Data from 2005 
in Niger shows that while stunted development affected four 
or five out of 10 children from both poor urban and rural 
areas, the proportion in non-slum urban areas was only about 
one out of four (or 26 per cent). The highest differential in 
malnutrition rates was observed in Ethiopia in 2005, where 
only 11 per cent of children in non-slum urban areas were 
malnourished, or some four times fewer than their counter-
parts in both urban slum areas and rural settlements (48 per 
cent). Similar patterns were observed in the Democratic Re-
public of Congo in 2007, with 41 per cent of children from 
poor urban areas malnourished compared with 16 per cent 
in non-slum urban areas. In Bolivia, while high proportions 
of malnutrition have been observed in rural and poor urban 
areas (37 per cent and 32 per cent, respectively), in non-slum 
urban areas fewer than 15 per cent of children experienced 
chronic malnutrition. In India and Bangladesh, the incidence 
of malnutrition in poor urban areas is more than twice that 
in non-slum urban areas: for India, the figures are 54 per cent 
and 21 per cent, respectively, and for Bangladesh, 51.4 per 
cent and 24 per cent.

Several factors account for nutritional deprivation among 
slum dwellers, including extreme poverty, discrimination and 
geographic  isolation.  The  multiple  poverty-related  factors 
leading to malnutrition include low incomes that limit access 
to food in terms of quantity, quality or both. Lack of access 
to  land  restricts  access  to  credit  and  other  resources,  with 
repercussions  on  income.6  The  replacement  of  traditional 
crops with more profitable cash crops also tends to compound 
nutritional vulnerability among the urban poor, reducing the 
availability of staple foods and further inflating prices. Food 
purchases among the urban poor are heavily dependent on 
competing demands for unavoidable non-food expenditures, 
such  as  commuting  to  work,  housing  and  remittances  to 
relatives in the countryside. With limited transport options, 
the urban poor seldom have easy access to central markets, 
and therefore are compelled to buy food in small quantities 
from local shops at higher prices.7 A recent survey conducted 
in Bangladesh in 2009 by the World Food Programme and 
UNICEF found that one in four households in Bangladesh 
is food-insecure, and 58 per cent of the households had had 
insufficient food during the previous 12 months.8 The same 
survey  showed  that  real  household  income  in  the  country 
dropped by 12 per cent between 2005 and 2008. At the end 
of 2008, food expenditure represented 62 per cent of total 
household expenditures, or 10 percentage points more than 
the national average in 2005.

Rising food prices worldwide are intensifying the crisis

The  prices  of  many  basic  foods  have  increased  over  the 
past two years, leading to a major crisis that affects millions 
of  poor  people  throughout  the  world.  The  price  increases 
have involved virtually all major commodities. International 
Monetary Fund statistics show that prices of imported rice and 
local cereals have increased by 230 to 350 per cent since early 
2008.9 Prices of dairy products and many cereals more than 
doubled in 2007 and continued to climb throughout 2009. 
This rapid price increase has worsened already dire conditions 
for the urban poor and rural populations.10 Before the current 
global  food  crisis,  many  countries  experienced  food  supply 
changes that reflected their own specific vulnerabilities. For 
example in 2005, Niger underwent a food crisis as a result of 
severe droughts. Bangladesh also experienced a food crisis in 
the same year. In both countries, the poorest people suffered 
the most – those who before the crisis were already spending 
far higher proportions of their incomes on food than those 
better-off, and found it increasingly difficult to afford basic 
rations.  For  them,  the  food  crisis  meant  smaller  portions, 
fewer  meals  and  foods  with  lower  nutritional  value,  with 
the immediate effect of increasing rates of malnutrition. In 
Madhya Pradesh, India, where ongoing food crises have been 
compounded by a four-year drought, the rise in world food 
prices has stretched many families beyond breaking point.11 
Rising food prices impact consumers in both rich and poor 
countries, where even the urban middle classes can be affected; 
this is particularly the case in developing countries.12 During a 
severe food crisis, hunger spreads to almost all socioeconomic 
groups in a given place. In Zimbabwe, for example, where the 
ongoing food crisis has its own internal causes, food shortages 
and  rising  costs  have  affected  all  social  segments,  even  the 
rich. For the first time, malnutrition became serious among 
the  richest  urban  residents,  affecting  25  per  cent  of  that 
population, compared with 29 per cent among the poorest 
urban residents – a difference of only four percentage points.

Hunger	is	not	only	an	outcome	of	food	deficiency	–	it	is	also	
an indication of the conditions in which families live. Besides 
food	deficiency,	malnutrition	is	influenced	by	living	conditions	
that increase exposure to disease; this is the case with the 
overcrowding,  inadequate  housing  and  poor  access  to  wa-
ter and sanitation that are typical of slums. At the commu-
nity	level,	lack	of	waste	management	and	waste	water	treat-
ment	 systems	 increases	 children’s	 likelihood	 of	 contracting	
diseases such as diarrhoea, acute respiratory infections and 
malaria. Available information shows that approximately half 
of all nutritional problems occur in areas that are exposed to 
environmental	 risks.	 Exposure	 to	 infectious	 illnesses,	 mainly	
parasite-borne,  creates  a  vicious  cycle  where  children  are 
constantly malnourished as a consequence of unhealthy living 
conditions.17 

Data from Benin shows that where shelter deprivation is se-
vere, child malnutrition is twice as prevalent as in areas with 
safe water, adequate sanitation and decent housing conditions. 
For	slum	households	that	lack	access	to	improved	water	and	
sanitation, the prevalence of child malnutrition is often higher 
even than in rural areas. This is the case in the Democratic 
Republic of Congo, where 46 per cent of children living in non-
durable urban housing are malnourished, compared with 16 
per cent in rural areas. In Cameroon in 2004, the proportions 
were 50 per cent and 16 per cent respectively. Similarly, in In-
dia, 45 per cent of children from households without adequate 
sanitation are malnourished, according to recent Demographic 
and Health Survey data. Even in Jordan, where proportions of 
malnourished children are low overall, 2007 data show that 36 
per cent of children without access to adequate sanitation in 
urban areas were malnourished, compared with 12 per cent 
among those in non-slum areas and 26 per cent among those 
in rural areas. High rates of malnutrition – as measured by the 
incidence of childhood diseases such as diarrhoea, malaria and 
acute	respiratory	infections	–	are	clearly	associated	with	lack	
of access to basic shelter amenities. 

Crisis of access and tight budgets

Many countries have enough food for all of the population, 
but only the richest can have access, while the poorest struggle 
every  day  to  secure  one  meal  for  their  children.  In  places 
where child malnutrition rates are high among the poorest, 
the crisis is often not one of food supply, but rather of access 
– access not only to food of sufficient quality and quantity 
for the household, but also access to income with which to 
buy or barter for food while on top of this paying for basic 
public  health  services,  education  and  other  needed  goods 
and services. This situation represents a “silent emergency”, 
characterized by persistent high degrees of acute malnutrition 
in  “non-emergency”  times.13  In  Latin  America  and  the 
Caribbean, for example, the greatest threat to food security 
is social inequality, since the region is the most unequal in 
the  world.14  High  food  prices  have  added  another  layer  of 
instability  for  the  poorest  urban  and  rural  residents  in  the 
region, who already found that affording the basic essentials 
for survival was a challenge. In these areas, it takes improved 
food distribution networks, better health facilities and access 
to improved drinking water to improve child nutrition.

During famines and droughts, rural populations can rely on 
domestic stores while those in urban slums often experience 
starvation, unable as they are to afford inflated food prices. 
Poor urban families often have to use up to 70 per cent of 
their income to purchase any food that is available, forcing 
them to reduce spending on education, childcare and other 
costs.  In  the  most  deeply  affected  countries,  families  eat 
fewer meals, sometimes even not eating for whole days, and 
children stop going to school as parents save on fees to pay for 
food.15 Under such circumstances, poor households become 
poorer,  suffering  a  significant  loss  in  household  well-being. 
The doubling of global food prices over the last three years 
could  potentially  push  100  million  people  in  low-income 
countries deeper into poverty.16

After the food crisis: What is next for the urban poor?

To  date,  no  adequate  systematic  effort  has  been  made 
to alleviate hunger in poor urban areas. The focus tends to 
remain  on  rural  areas,  where  prevailing  responses  are  not 
relevant in urban settings, since supply-related malnutrition 
in  cities  is  largely  a  consequence  of  household  dependence 
on  food  prices  and  cash  income.  Since  urban  dwellers  do 
not cope with vulnerability and risk in the same way as rural 
populations, unique policy responses are required to address 
their needs. Experts predict that the food crisis will be long-
term, and that the worst is yet to come unless extraordinary 
measures are taken to help the most vulnerable. In hunger-
struck  developing  countries,  people  have  been  consuming 
food stocks and selling off assets to purchase food, but they 
will not be able to do so indefinitely.18 As recent Demographic 
and Health Survey data on child malnutrition reveals, hunger 
is endemic in many poor urban areas. The urban poor were 
living with hunger before the crisis, are still living with hunger

The  surge  in  food  prices  since  the  end  of  2006 
has led to increasing hunger in the world’s poor-
est countries and made urban food security more 
precarious. The Food and Agriculture Organization 
(FAO) estimated the number of hungry people at 
923 million in 2007, a more than 80 million rise 
since 1992. The most rapid increases in chronic 
hunger occurred between 2003 and 2005, and in 
2007 when high food prices drove millions of peo-
ple into food insecurity. Chronic hunger and mal-
nutrition became more prevalent among the urban 
poor, who had to spend more to purchase not just 
food but other household necessities as well. 

Agencies  monitoring  food  security  in  Kenya,  for 
instance,  have  recorded  deepening  urban  food 
insecurity caused by rising prices and further com-
pounded	by	conflict,	floods	and	drought.	In	March	
2009, an estimated 4.1 million urban poor in the 
country	were	classified	as	“highly	food-insecure”.	
High  prices  caused  slum-dwelling  households  to 
reduce food consumption; as many as 7.6 million 
slum-dwellers countrywide found themselves un-
able to meet daily food needs, with maize prices 
soaring by more than 130 per cent in the capital, 
Nairobi, and by 85 per cent in the coastal town 
of Mombasa, in 2008. The cost of non-food items 
also increased, leading to reduced overall house-
hold	consumption.	Prices	of	cooking	fuels,	particu-
larly	kerosene,	rose	by	30	to	50	per	cent,	and	the	
cost of water more than doubled. 

In  neighbouring  Burundi,  the  urban  areas  of  Bu-
jumbura,  Gitenga  and  Ngozi  saw  a  20  per  cent 
increase  in  local  food  prices  between  2007  and 
2008. The situation was exacerbated by the ongo-
ing	conflict	that	has	hindered	agricultural	produc-
tion  in  recent  years.  In  the  same  period,  wheat 
prices doubled in Senegal and quadrupled in So-
malia.	Zimbabwe’s	highly	inflationary	environment	
has	reduced	purchasing	power,	making	nearly	half	
the population food-insecure. In Zimbabwe as in 
other African countries, urban communities resort 
to a variety of coping strategies, including reduced 
frequency  and  contents  of  meals,  which  could 
lead to rising malnutrition. 

Stabilization  or  decline  in  food  prices  have  oc-
curred	 in	 several	 countries,	 but	 the	 outlook	 for	
some	African	countries	remains	bleak:	they	have	
been unable to reduce prices to pre-2006 levels, 
which has increased both malnutrition and house-
hold food expenditures.

and will continue to live with hunger after the global food 
crisis  ends.  Indeed,  they  experience  structural  food  crises 
on  an  ongoing  basis.  Consequently,  it  will  take  structural 
measures to tackle hunger among the urban poor. 

Long-term solutions will depend on a variety of factors, such 
as provision of jobs and services and reduction of poverty and 
inequalities, which could take generations to achieve in many 
low-income  countries.  Policymakers  can  build  on  currently 
available  knowledge  and  resources  in  order  dramatically  to 
reduce  hunger  among  the  urban  poor,  particularly  in  the 
production, marketing, distribution, handling and control of 
food for the urban market.19 For example, in Sri Lanka in the 
1970s, a successful food delivery system known as “fair price” 
(or “ration”) shops distributed staples at subsidized prices in 
low-income urban areas. While many international agencies 
advise  against  the  general  use  of  food  subsidies,  research 
shows that it is possible to design targeted interventions for 
particular  commodities  or  types  of  “ration”  shops.20  Local 
authorities must also pay attention to the potential of urban 
agriculture.  Even  in  crowded  areas,  people  can  often  find 
space to grow vegetables or raise animals to supplement their 
food purchases.21 

Hunger alleviation goes beyond food availability

Eradicating hunger will require multiple interventions, and 
not only those related to food availability. Nutrition and good 
health  depend  on  access  to  health  care  as  well  as  adequate 
food, particularly for children. Use of safe water, improved 
sanitation  and  durable  housing  materials,  together  with 
provision of sufficient living areas to ease overcrowding, will 
improve the chances of better health and life conditions for 
slum dwellers and rural residents, with or without increases 
in food availability. This goes to show that slum upgrading 
and the sustainability of health and nutrition programmes are 
linked and should, together, become part of a comprehensive 
approach to improving the lives of the urban poor.22 

More  comprehensive  provision  of  health  services,  including 
immunization campaigns, would also improve nutrition among 
the urban poor through prevention of gastrointestinal and infec-
tious diseases. Along with primary health care, direct nutrition 
programmes  are  urgently  needed,  including  food  fortification 
and mass distribution of capsules and tablets to eliminate defi-
ciencies of iodine, iron, folic acid and vitamin A. Adequate diet 
among pregnant and lactating women, together with com-
munity  education  in  proper  infant  and  child  feeding,  can 
also improve children’s nutritional well being.23

The health divide

In  order  to  understand  public  health  needs  in  urban 
areas,  one  must  look  beyond  poverty  rates  and  crude  rates 
of morbidity or mortality, and focus on disparities in living 
conditions. Although poverty alleviation is often considered 
the  most  important  step  toward  improving  general  health, 
in urban areas marginal increases in income for the poor do 
not  ensure  access  to  decent  accommodation,  safe  water  or 
adequate sanitation. The poor are typically driven to the least 
developed areas of a city, where dilapidated environments lead 
to worse health outcomes and greater risks of premature death 
than in improved, well-maintained areas. Child mortality rates 
remain highly associated with diarrhoeal diseases, malaria and 
acute respiratory infections related to overcrowding and air 
pollution, which in turn result from various environmental 
health  hazards  such  as  lack  of  sanitation  and  hygiene,  lack 
of  access  to  safe  water,  poor  housing  conditions,  poor 
management  of  solid  wastes,  and  many  other  hazardous 
conditions.  Children 
in  substandard  environments  are 
exposed to contaminated air, food, water, soil and conditions 
where parasite-carrying insects breed. Environmental equity 
is a more powerful determinant of health and mortality than 
the overall wealth of nations.24 

Adequate shelter protects against exposure to 
environmental diseases

Poor  sanitation,  combined  with  unsafe  water  supply  and 
lack of hygiene, claims the lives of many slum dwellers every 
year.  Sanitation  is  the  primary  factor  that  protects  water, 
air, soil and food from contamination, and thereby reduces 
the  risk  of  disease.25  When  sanitation  is  combined  with 
positive hygiene – hand washing with soap or other cleansing 
agents, and safe storage of water – its effectiveness is greatest, 
creating  a  safe  environment  and  enhancing  the  health  of 
the population. However, in densely populated urban areas, 
access  to  latrines  does  not  significantly  reduce  the  risk  of 
faecal-oral diseases because the facilities may not be cleaned 
and  maintained  regularly.  Indeed,  short  of  sound  hygiene 
practices, latrines alone have no positive influence on health. 
Recent data from Pakistan, for instance, indicates very little 
difference  in  the  frequency  of  diarrhoeal  episodes  between 
households with latrines and those without.26 Furthermore, 
in  2006,  the  prevalence  of  diarrhoea  among  children  in 
Pakistan was 21.2 per cent for those living in non-slum urban 
households,  compared  with  23  per  cent  for  those  living  in 
slum  households.  The  only  significant  difference  in  the 
prevalence of diarrhoea among urban children emerges when 
severe shelter deprivations are present: in households lacking 
all four basic shelter services, the prevalence is 38 per cent. 
Similarly, there are differences between children of the poorest 
and the richest urban families, among whom the prevalence 
of diarrhoea is 26 per cent and 18 per cent, respectively.27 

The link between sanitation and diarrhoeal diseases is not 
uniform  across  regions,  countries  or  cities.  For  instance,  in 

s
Kroo Bay slum, Freetown, Sierra Leone. Better housing conditions are essential to 
ensuring a healthy population. ©Save the children UK/iRiN

Cameroon,  children  from  households  without  improved 
water, improved sanitation and sufficient living area feature 
a much greater prevalence of diarrhoeal diseases – 33.3 per 
cent – than those living in non-slum urban households (9 per 
cent). In Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), the mere 
lack of improved sanitation is enough for a child to be highly 
exposed to diarrhoeal diseases (18.3 per cent, compared with 
13.9  per  cent  among  children  of  households  with  all  four 
basic shelter services). In DRC, when combined with lack of 
sanitation, lack of improved water causes the prevalence of 
diarrhoea to rise to 23.9 per cent. 

Improving the quantity and quality of water available for 
domestic use can significantly reduce illness and death from 
diarrhoeal and waterborne illnesses. However, in some cases 
the source of water is safe, but contamination occurs through 
polluted containers or other environmental conditions before 
the water reaches the household for consumption. In many 
cities of the developing world, water supplies are undrinkable, 
contaminated  as  they  are  by  bacteria,  untreated  or  poorly 
treated sewage, heavy metals or silt from soil erosion, fertilizers 
and pesticides, mining tailings and industrial waste. According 
to 2007 data from Jordan, the sole lack of improved water is 
enough by itself to double (to 32.3 per cent, compared with 
16  per  cent)  the  risk  of  diarrhoeal  diseases  for  children  by 
comparison with the entire urban area. Even in Jordan’s rural 
areas, only 16 per cent of children were affected by diarrhoeal 
diseases in 2007. 

Better housing conditions are also essential to ensuring a 
healthy  population.  High-density  accommodation  in  slums 
and squatter settlements, or poor-quality housing in general, 
intensifies  the  risk  of  disease  transmission.  Overcrowding 
increases  exposure  to  droplet-spread  infections,  as  poor 
ventilation  inhibits  the  dispersion  of  contaminated  air  and 
lack of sunshine prevents natural air sterilization by sunlight.

In an overcrowded slum area, pit latrines expose more children 
to  diarrhoeal  diseases  compared  with  a  non-overcrowded 
rural area.28 In slums, where many households often share a 
single toilet between them, even the use of improved latrines 
is  unsafe  and  exposes  children  to  diarrhoeal  diseases.  The 
number of latrines may not be adequate, leading to unsanitary 
conditions  that  increase  exposure  to  contaminated  faecal 
matter and then to diarrhoea. The concentration of people 
living  in  small,  poorly  ventilated  areas  increases  the  risk  of 
disease transmission and multiple infections.29 In Nepal, lack 
of sanitation in overcrowded urban areas exposes children to 
diarrhoeal diseases at a higher rate (17.9 per cent) than in the 
country’s rural areas (12.6 per cent) or its urban environments 
overall (10.3 per cent). Where all four basic shelter services 
are  lacking,  the  prevalence  of  diarrhoea  rises  to  20.8  per 
cent.  In  India  as  well,  children  from  households  without 
improved  water  and  sanitation  in  poor  housing  conditions 
are exposed to a high prevalence of diarrhoea (16.7 per cent); 
in Namibia and Niger, lack of sanitation and durable housing 
are also responsible for high rates of diarrhoeal diseases among 
children, with a prevalence of 17.6 per cent in Namibia and 
29.9  per  cent  in  Niger,  compared  with  11.6  per  cent  and 
16.7 per cent, respectively, among children from non-slum 
households.

Improperly  managed  solid  waste  can  clog  storm  drains, 
cause  flooding,  result  in  garbage  heaps  and  provide  breed-
ing  and  feeding  grounds  for  mosquitoes,  flies  and  rodents. 
The combination of environmental hazards surrounding solid 
waste can lead to injuries and easy transmission of bacterial 
diseases  and  parasitic  infections.  Occasional  flooding  and 
the presence of pools of standing water can lead to increased 
incidence of malaria and other mosquito-borne diseases, es-
pecially during rainy seasons, placing workers and local resi-
dents at risk. Public facilities often fall into disrepair for lack 
of maintenance, setting the stage for accidents and poor waste 
management. Living in a poor environment can also make 
it harder to access other shelter services. Any positive effects 
of improved sanitation facilities can be diluted and offset by 
ineffective management, collection, treatment and disposal of 
human excreta, household waste water, storm water, sewage 
effluents, industrial and other hazardous waste products. 

In  most  African  cities,  households  typically  have  no 
safe  ways  to  dispose  of  solid  waste.  In  Benin,  for  example, 
fewer  than  50  per  cent  of  urban  households  benefit  from 
collection of household wastes by public or private systems; 
this  proportion  is  particularly  low  in  smaller  cities  (17  per 
cent, compared with 47 per cent in large cities). Associated 
health problems include high incidences of cholera, diarrhoea 
and dysentery, especially in children who tend to play where 
waste accumulates. Again, in Benin, recent data shows that 
the prevalence of diarrhoea among children under 5 years old 
is 18.5 per cent in those urban households dumping waste in

the yard, compared with 7 per cent where waste is collected 
and taken away. In Kenya in 2003, one out of four children 
living in households where solid waste is dumped in the yard 
had diarrhoea, compared to fewer than one out of 10 living 
in  households  with  regular  garbage  collection.  In  addition 
to  lack  of  solid  waste  collection,  it  is  recognized  that  lack 
of  drainage,  especially  in  areas  of  communal  water  supply, 
breeds  mosquitoes  and  flies,  which  can  be  a  nuisance  and 
spread disease. Water lines flow next to storm drains, which 
frequently turn into open sewers.

Poor  management  of  waste  and  waste  water  can  also 
increase the spread of disease in many ways. Mosquito-related 
diseases, especially malaria and dengue fever, can be spread 
from breeding areas in standing water that collects in potholes, 
disposed-of construction materials and holes dug for sand and 
gravel.  Demographic  and  Health  Surveys  in  African  urban 
areas show that the prevalence of fever remains high in many 
cities. In Benin in 2001, for example, more than two out of five 
children living in households where waste was not collected 
had fever. In contrast, only one out of four children living 
in  households  with  regular  collection  had  fever,  according 
to the same survey. Lack of collection of household waste is 
also  associated  with  the  spread  of  respiratory  infections.  In 
Benin, the prevalence of acute respiratory infections is 17.1 
per  cent  among  children  living  in  households  where  waste 
is dumped in the yard, compared with 13.6 per cent among 
children living in households with regular waste collection. 
In Ethiopia, the prevalence of acute respiratory infections is 
six times higher among children living in households where 
the waste is dumped in a nearby river than among children 
living  in  households  with  regular  waste  collection  (18  per 
cent, compared with 3 per cent). 

Indoor air pollution and acute respiratory infections

It is estimated that indoor air pollution is responsible for 
some  three  million  deaths  every  year.30  Women  who  cook 
in enclosed quarters using biomass fuels and coal are at risk 
of chronic bronchitis and acute respiratory infections, as are 
their children, who are often exposed to significant indoor air 
pollution alongside their mothers on a daily basis.31 Indoor 
air pollution is a “quiet” and overlooked killer, and lack of 
awareness is one of the primary obstacles to the widespread 
implementation of existing, proven responses.32

A majority of households in many sub-Saharan African cit-
ies are still primarily dependent on biomass fuels for cooking. 
For example, in Benin, 86 per cent of urban families use wood 
or charcoal for cooking, and the prevalence remains high even 
in non-slum areas (74 per cent). Wood and charcoal are pre-
dominant  in  the  cities  of  10  African  countries  reviewed  in 
UN-HABITAT’s analysis of Demographic and Health Survey 
data (Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Ghana, Ethiopia, Ma-
lawi, Mali, Rwanda, Uganda and Zambia). In these cities, the 
prevalence of acute respiratory infections among children un-
der 5 is highest in households using wood, charcoal or dung. 
When burned, these solid fuels produce significant amounts

of  pollutants,  including  suspended  particulate  matter  and 
noxious gases, particularly in the absence of improved stoves 
or adequate ventilation.33 In Burkina Faso, the prevalence of 
acute  respiratory  infections  among  urban  children  under  5 
is almost two times higher in households cooking with solid 
fuels than in those using cleaner-burning liquid or gas fuels 
(9.2 per cent, compared with 5.1 per cent). Kigali, Rwanda, 
displays higher variations, with a 6 per cent prevalence of acute 
respiratory  infections  among  children  living  in  households 
cooking  with  non-solid  fuels,  compared  with  15.6  per  cent 
among those using solid fuels. The use of dung for fuel is rare 
in most African cities today, but as indicated in many studies, 
when burned, dung produces more pollutants than any other 
solid fuel. In the urban areas of Congo, the prevalence of acute 
respiratory infections is twice as high in households cooking 
with dung than in those using wood or charcoal (16.8 per cent 
vs. 8.8 per cent and 7.6 per cent, respectively). The urban areas 
of Ethiopia display the largest variation, with an acute respira-
tory infection prevalence of 28.7 per cent among households 
cooking with dung, compared with 8.3 per cent among those 
using charcoal and 4.8 per cent among those using kerosene.

The modern environment of disease

Against a global background of urbanization and continuing 
industrialization, modern environmental health hazards have 
become  major  contributors  to  the  environmental  diseases 
affecting  the  African  conti nent.34  The  major  such  hazards 
include  water  pollution  from  environmental  degradation 
and  industrial  operations,  urban  air  pollution  from  motor 
vehicles,  radiation  hazards,  climate  change,  and  emerging 
or  re-emerging  infectious  diseases.  Industrial  pollution,  in 
particular,  is  becoming  highly  concentrated  in  expanding 
urban  areas,  and  as  a  result  pollution  intensity  in  Africa  is 
among the high est in the world.35 Such environmental health 
hazards  affect  many  urban  residents  even  in  countries  that 
have made significant progress in the provision of access to 
services,  including  improved  water  and  sanitation,  as  well 
as durable housing with sufficient living area. In Dakar, for 
instance, and despite reduced numbers of slum-dwellers, the 
prevalence of diarrhoea among children remains high, even 
compared  with  rural  areas:  28.1  per  cent  in  the  Senegalese 
capital, vs. 16.7 per cent in smaller cities and 22.4 per cent in 
rural areas. In Dakar, access to improved water and sanitation, 
durable housing, waste collection and sufficient living areas 
has been extended to many households, but even among these 
the prevalence of diarrhoea remains dramatically high (27.1 
per cent, compared with 32.2 per cent in non-slum areas). It is 
clear that the fight against childhood diseases must transcend 
the traditional realm of the household, in order to encompass 
the modern environment of disease: the neighbourhood, and 
the city as a whole, with all the attendant risks and harms. 

Environmental risks to children’s health become particularly 
acute after the first few months of life, and again when they 
enter  toddlerhood  and  begin  to  move  around  inside  and 
outside the home. There is little difference between neonatal 
mortality rates in slum and non-slum urban areas; only after 
the first few months of life, when they start receiving external 
food and liquids, do more children die in slum than in non-
slum  areas.  This  can  only  further  highlight  the  importance 
of proper homes and diets as children grow. For example in 
Egypt, antenatal and delivery health care is quasi-universal, 
resulting  in  relatively  low  neonatal  mortality.  However,  a 
clear  divide  emerges  early  on  in  post-neonatal  mortality, 
with  deaths  of  children  aged  between  one  and  12  months 
two times higher in slums than in non-slum areas (27 deaths 
per  thousand,  compared  with  13  per  thousand).  A  similar 
order of magnitude has been recorded in Morocco: the post-
neonatal  mortality  rate  is  15  per  thousand  in  slum  areas, 
compared with 8 per thousand in non-slum areas, although 
in  both  types  of  settlements  the  neonatal  mortality  rate  is 
an identical 24 per thousand.  In urban Benin, the situation 
is alarming as the post-neonatal mortality rate is 46 deaths 
per  thousand  in  slums,  or  three  times  higher  than  in  non-
slum urban areas (14 deaths per thousand), although, again, 
neonatal mortality rates are an identical 24 per thousand. This 
demonstrates that antenatal health care clearly benefits babies 
more in the immediate period after birth than after the first 
month of their lives, when different outcomes reflect different 
social conditions.36

Cities provide better access to health services

In most countries, children born to the richest families have 
a high probability of access to health care, including antenatal 
and delivery, as well as immunization. Even in countries like 
Niger, where the overall proportion of children without any 
immunization is as high as 40 per cent, the majority of the 
better-off children are immunized, or slightly more than twice 
as many of the poorest children. Although access to health care 
and delivery is skewed in favour of the rich in Niger, all chil-
dren in urban areas are still better off on this count than those 
in rural areas. The same is true in Malawi, where more than 
80 per cent of children living in slums have been immunized 
against measles. In Malawi as in most countries, this particu-
lar type of immunization is widespread in cities, both in non-
slum and slum areas. The effect of urbanization on access to 
health care services is undeniably positive; still, in some coun-
tries like Niger, Nigeria, India, Pakistan and Haiti, childhood 
diseases such as measles remain among the five main causes 
of child death in slum and rural areas where immunization 
is not widespread. In those countries, it will take substantial 
resources to curb the number of deaths related to measles and 
other diseases such as diarrhoea, pneumonia and malaria.

Improving urban living environments with thorough 
policymaking

Poor  living  environments  clearly  add  to  the  health 
challenges slum dwellers keep facing. Inadequate sanitation, 
hygiene  and  water  lead  not  only  to  more  sickness  and 
deaths,  but  also  to  higher  health  care  costs,  lower  school 
enrolment and retention rates, and lower labour productivity 
among  slum  dwellers  than  their  non-slum  counterparts. 
Policymakers  can  alleviate  health  inequalities  in  cities 
through  comprehensive  primary  health  care,  especially 
for  the  poor.  Policymakers  must  at  the  same  time  address 
related  issues  like  shelter  deprivations  and  slum  dwellers’ 
lack  of  access  to  healthy  food.  Urban  health  inequalities 
must also be redressed with an adequate, functional network 
of services that reach out to all sections of the population. 
Finally, urban health policies must tackle social inequality in 
a proactive manner, since, as mentioned earlier, the urban 
poor will continue to depend on market vagaries for health 
care and all other aspects of daily life, including employment 
and sheer survival.

Education: Opportunities and inequalities in cities

Generalization of basic education in some countries

Education  contributes  to  many  important  dimensions  of 
well-being. It has a crucial role to play in poverty reduction, 
improved general health, halting the spread of HIV/AIDS and, 
more generally, enabling people to fulfil their potential. Basic 
education is a human right and is central to the Millennium 
Declaration, which in the year 2000 pledged that by 2015 
boys  and  girls  across  the  world  would  be  able  to  complete 
a  full  course  of  primary  education.  Today,  most  national 
constitutions acknowledge the right to education, but effective 
access can remain a challenge, especially for those living in 
poverty. In countries where primary education is compulsory 
under law, governments deploy a nationwide education system 
with free primary school and social assistance towards indirect 
costs like transport and meals. However, effective attendance 
and access are rarely enforced in many countries. Parents are 
all-too frequently left free to decide whether or not to send 
their children to school, and do not face penalties when they 
fail  to  do  so.  Finally,  social  inequality  in  many  countries 
influences and shapes the education system.

Access to education is greater in cities than in rural areas

Cities  are  hosts  to  more  educational  infrastructure  than 
villages.  They  provide  young  people  with  opportunities  to 
continue their education and access gainful employment in 
the formal sector, but not all cities are alike when it comes 
to young people’s education and employment needs. Cities 
can also generate and intensify the kind of social exclusion 
that  denies  the  benefits  of  the  “urban  advantage”  to  youth 
and  other  marginalized  groups,  particularly  in  conditions 
of  unprecedented  urban  growth,  increasing  poverty  and 
inequality, or inadequate policies. Even within one and the 
same city, some youth are able to succeed and prosper while 
others drop out of school, fail to find productive employment 
and sink into poverty.37

Available data indicates that enrolment rates are in general 
much higher in urban than in rural areas. In most of the coun-
tries reviewed here, more than 75 per cent of primary educa-
tion age children in cities attend school, but in rural areas the 
proportion drops under 50 per cent. This pattern is most pro-
nounced in Niger, where 73 per cent of children in the capital, 
Niamey,  attend  school,  compared  with  17  per  cent  in  rural 
areas; in smaller cities and towns, 53 per cent of children of 
primary school age are enrolled. A similar pattern prevails in 
Burkina Faso, where the rural communities lag far behind their 
urban counterparts, with enrolment rates of 21 and 73 per cent 
respectively. In both Niger and Burkina Faso, as in many Afri-
can countries, the “urban advantage” is quite clear for both rich 
and poor. Enrolment rates in rural areas are mainly dependent 
on the availability and accessibility of school facilities. 

In both Latin America and Asia, schooling is quasi-universal 
in  urban  and  rural  areas,  with  few  exceptions.  In  some 
African countries, any disparities in enrolment rates remain 
small across cities and villages. This is the case in Cameroon, 
Congo,  Kenya,  Lesotho,  Madagascar,  Malawi,  Namibia, 
Rwanda, South Africa, Tanzania, Togo, Uganda and Zambia, 
as well as in Egypt and Morocco, which also feature in the 
UN-HABITAT survey sample. In Egypt, school attendance 
rates remain consistent across various areas, with enrolment 
rates of 86 per cent in the capital and large cities, 89 per cent 
in smaller cities and towns and 84 per cent in rural areas. A 
broadly similar pattern is evident in Morocco, where school 
enrolment rates are 91 per cent in the capital and large cities, 
92 per cent in smaller cities and towns, and 84 per cent in 
rural areas.

Cities also generate inequalities in education

Social and cultural barriers continue to deny slum dwellers 
the opportunity to complete basic education.38 Children from 
slum communities are less likely to enroll in school, tend to 
complete fewer years and are less likely to complete primary 
or  attend  secondary  school.  Although  large  majorities  of 
children in most cities are enrolled in school, the differential 
between  slum  and  non-slum  areas  remains  clear.  This  is 
particularly evident in the poorer areas of many African cities, 
where primary school enrolment is decreasing. In Eastern and 
Southern Africa, rural areas saw the most significant increases 
in school enrolment in the late 1990s, and many poor urban 
families  were  left  behind.  In  Tanzania,  for  example,  net 
enrolment ratios increased in both rural and non-slum urban 
areas, but actually decreased in slum areas. Similar patterns 
have been reported in Zambia and Zimbabwe, but are not 
confined to sub-Saharan Africa. 

For instance in Guatemala, only 54 per cent of children 
living  in  slums  were  enrolled  in  primary  education  in 
1999,  compared  with  73  per  cent  in  non-slum  urban 
areas and 61 per cent in rural areas. Brazil reported similar 
enrolment figures in the late 1990s, too. The educational gap 
associated with economic status can be quite substantial.39 In 
Bangladesh, Nepal and Pakistan, for example, fewer than 40 
per cent of children in the poorest socioeconomic quintile 
complete primary school, compared with 70 to 80 per cent 
in the richest quintile. In Sierra Leone, the figures are 20 per 
cent and 70 per cent, respectively. Among slum communities 
in Nigeria, children are 35 per cent less likely to attend school 
than those from non-slum areas. In Bolivia, only 10 per cent 
of children in the poorest quintile complete primary school, 
as compared with 40 per cent of those in non-slum areas, and 
55 per cent of children in the richest quintile.40

Inequalities intensify at higher levels of education

In many countries in both the developing and developed 
world,  the  education  system  perpetuates  and  reproduces 
social inequalities. In China, for instance, research shows that 
government policies have fallen short of addressing inequitable 
practices:  as  schools  perpetuate  and  reproduce  inequities,  a 
new  system  of  social  stratification  emerges  on  the  back  of 
market forces rather than Socialist principles.41 The American 
education system also comes under criticism for perpetuating 
the social inequalities of a class hierarchy, which is achieved 
through allocation of differential “educational capital” along 
class lines. 

Secondary education, where the returns on knowledge and 
skill  development  are  highest,  has  a  particularly  important 
role to play if children are to acquire the skills and abilities 
needed to enter the labour market and become economically 
empowered.  This  is  the  stage  where  slum  and  non-slum 
school enrolment rates are seen to diverge widely. Not only 
is  enrolment  of  slum-dwelling  children  lower  in  secondary 
school, but many of those enrolled fail to succeed. As measured 
against  learning  achievement,  the  quality  of  educational 
services in most poor communities remains low. Research in 
both developed and developing countries also underscores the 
prime importance of educational quality (as measured by tests 
of cognitive achievement) for the level of earnings.42 In the 
United States, for example, a one standard deviation increase 
in  mathematics  performance  at  the  end  of  high  school  is 
associated with 12 per cent higher annual earnings.43 

Education  inequalities  in  both  learning  and  earning 
outcomes persist in cities. Evidence from Ghana, for example, 
shows  that  although  37  per  cent  of  pupils  stay  in  school 
through  ninth  grade,  only  5  per  cent  are  fully  literate.  In 
Brazil, fewer than 22 per cent of pupils attend through ninth 
grade,  and  only  8  per  cent  are  deemed  literate.  Therefore, 
better teaching standards are crucial if the performance of both 
boys and girls is to be improved, and equality in educational 
outcomes to become effective. Merely building schools and 
increasing  enrolment  without  ensuring  quality  is  unlikely 
to help countries meet their human capital objectives in an 
increasingly  knowledge-based  global  economy.  Recognizing 
that  universal  primary  education  cannot  be  achieved  by 
expanding access at the expense of quality, policymakers are 
seeking to improve both simultaneously. 

Education and gender inequality

The  education  of  girls  and  young  women  generates 
powerful  poverty-reducing  synergies  and  yields  enormous 
intergenerational gains. It is positively correlated with enhanced 
economic productivity, more robust labour markets, higher 
earnings and improved public health and well-being. Much 
has been done in favour of gender equity in education over 
the  past  15  years.  For  instance,  according  to  Demographic 
and  Health  Survey  data,  the  rate  of  girls’  enrolment  at  the 
primary level in low-income countries has grown from 87 per 
cent in 1990 to 94 per cent in 2004, signaling a significant 
narrowing  of  the  gender  gap.  This  progress  was  only

possible because policymakers clearly recognized the crucial 
importance of girls’ education in development as well as the 
benefits derived from the “education for all” agenda. Various 
policy frameworks, including the “women in development”, 
“gender and development”, post-structural and rights-based 
approaches, have contributed to gender equality and quality 
education in their own way.44 The “women in development” 
approach  generates  clear  policy  directives  on  issues  such  as 
the hiring of more female teachers, tracking the number of 
girls and women in and out of school, overcoming barriers 
to girls’ education, and reaping the benefits of schooling. As 
for  the  “gender  and  development”  approach,  it  encourages 
provision of complementary basic education programmes for 
socially excluded girls, as well as gender-sensitive and gender-
equalizing curricula. 

Estimates  suggest  that  gender  equality  in  education  has 
made uneven progress within regions, though. In 2005, some 
72 million children around the world remained out of school, 
with a majority (41 million) of girls from groups with multiple 
disadvantages  and  living  mainly  in  sub-Saharan  Africa  and 
Southern Asia. Where girls are still at a disadvantage, resources 
and school facilities are limited and enrolment is altogether 
low.  In  many  countries  with  low  overall  enrolment,  fewer 
than 50 per cent of primary school-aged girls are involved. 
Female illiteracy rates remain high in these parts of the world, 
particularly in urban poor and rural areas, where many girls 
drop out of school too early to acquire the skills they need 
to function as literate individuals. Demographic and Health 
Survey data points to four main reasons why girls discontinue 
their education: lack of money, early marriage and pregnancy, 
domestic work responsibilities, and poor performance. Only 
a small proportion – fewer than 10 per cent – of girls and 
young women who had left school said it was because they 
had  graduated.  Gender  gaps  in  education  have  historically 
been  wider  in  Pakistan  than  the  world  average,  with  girls 
lagging  behind  boys  in  terms  of  access,  school  standards 
and  outcomes:  in  primary  education,  for  instance,  the  gap 
worsened by 30 per cent between 1985 and 1995.45 A similar 
situation prevails in Yemen, where 60 per cent of women are 
illiterate, compared with a 45 per cent national rate.46 

Boys’ enrolment takes a downturn

areas. Improvements in girls’ enrolment have resulted from 
eight interrelated strategies, some of which may provide some 
insights into ways to keep boys in school, as well: (1) elimination 
of  user  fees;  (2)  conditional  cash  transfers;  (3)  increased 
focus  on  gender  inequality;  (4)  recognition  of  cultural  and 
social constraints to girls’ education; (5) improvement in the 
economic returns to girls’ education; (6) promotion of post-
primary  education  for  girls;  (7)  making  primary  education 
more gender-sensitive; and (8) developing and disseminating 
gender-sensitive school and pedagogical models. Obviously, 
none  of  these  strategies  can  be  implemented  wholesale  to 
tackle the regression in boys’ enrolment, although they retain 
a general degree of relevance that deserves attention. 

Efforts to improve the education of girls in some countries 
have  resulted  in  significant  increases  in  their  enrolment 
numbers,  but  today  a  slight  regression  in  boys’  enrolment 
and participation is becoming a cause for concern. In certain 
parts of Latin America and the Caribbean, the Middle East, 
and North and Southern Africa, many more girls than boys 
are now enrolled. In developed regions and Eastern Asia too, 
the gender disparity has reversed, with more girls than boys 
now  enrolled  at  the  primary  level.  In  Bangladesh,  boys  are 
dropping  out  of  school  in  much  larger  numbers  than  girls 
– a phenomenon that is now the country’s most significant 
gender challenge – to the point where girls now account for 
60 per cent of enrolment in some schools, especially in rural 

Education remains a luxury for the urban poor in the 
face of current crises 

In those urban areas where income and social inequalities are 
significant, many urban families are so poor, or impoverished, 
that they cannot ensure basic education for their children. In 
urban areas, access to education is often determined by ability 
to pay fees more than by the physical proximity of schools, 
or  by  curricula.  School  fees,  costs  of  uniforms,  materials, 
exams  and  other  educational  expenses  have  been  shown  to

formal  education.  In  Dhaka,  parents  spend  around  10  per 
cent of household income on school costs for every child, but 
this proportion is twice as high (20 per cent) for the poorest 
households.  UN-HABITAT’s  Urban  Inequities  Survey  data 
indicates that in Lagos, Casablanca and São Paulo, families in 
the poorest income quintile spend more than 25 per cent of 
incomes on school costs. 

These  statistics  highlight  the  economic  dilemma  poor 
urban families are facing, caught as they are between securing 
a better future for their children through education, on the 
one hand, and meeting their own and their children’s needs 
for basic sustenance, housing, transportation and privatized 
basic services like water and sanitation, on the other hand. 
In  slums,  a  majority  of  parents  postpone  sending  their 
children, especially girls, to school, until they can take care of 
other expenses such as food, rent and transportation. In the 
meantime, children are expected to assist with domestic work 
and menial, low-earning jobs.

The  direct  effects  of  the  financial  and  food  crises  are 
devastating  for  poor  urban  families  who  were  already 
struggling  to  send  at  least  one  child  to  school.  Today  in 
many  developing  countries,  the  children  of  poor  families 
face the most straightforward of dilemmas: food, or school. 
The immediate future is secured, if only barely, at the cost 
of  forgoing  opportunities  for  a  better,  longer-term  future. 
For  parents,  postponing  new  enrolments  and  withdrawing 
enrolled children are the only options.47 Girls are the typical 
first  casualties  of  this  hard  choice,48  as  suggested  by  DHS 
data. In the urban areas of Uganda and Zambia, for instance, 
74 per cent and 51 per cent, respectively, of young females 
between the ages of 15 and 24 mentioned inability to pay as 
the main reason they stopped going to school. 

In  Latin  America,  the  impact  of  the  financial  crisis  on 
education  can  be  more  visible  in  larger  than  in  smaller 
cities. This is particularly the case in Bolivia, where 93 per 
cent  of  children  in  small  cities  and  towns  are  enrolled  in 
primary education, compared with 68 per cent in the capital 
and  other  large  cities,  and  72  per  cent  in  rural  areas.  This 
disparity between large and smaller cities could be explained 
by the deep inequalities that characterize larger urban areas. 
A similar situation prevails in Colombia, though to a lesser 
degree, with 82 per cent of children in smaller cities attending 
school, compared with 73 per cent in large cities – the same as 
the percentage of rural children enrolled in school.

Among some impoverished urban communities in Africa, 
it is common practice for families to have boys educated in 
their village of origin, where schools are less expensive, while 
girls remain at home in the city to help with housework.49 In 
2007, girls already accounted for 54 per cent of the world’s 
out-of-school population, a percentage that is only likely to 
increase. In times of crisis, school attendance always declines 
in  developing  countries;  the  tragedy  is  that  some  children 
may never return.

The  combined  social  and  cultural  factors  that  make  it 
difficult for girls to enroll and complete school also contribute 
to  their  dissatisfaction  and  poor  performance  regarding 
education.  Combinations  of  domestic  chores,  marriage, 
motherhood  and  financial  constraints  seriously  challenge 
girls’  ability  to  maintain  regular  attendance,  or  to  succeed 
when they do attend. Surveys show that poor performance is, 
in itself, the reason a significant proportion of urban young 
females give for dropping out of school before they complete 
their education or pass key national examinations.

Unsafe school environments

Another  significant,  though  rarely  mentioned  factor 
behind low school enrolment in poor urban neighbourhoods 
is a perceived lack of safety, especially for girls. Schools in 
many slum areas are not child-friendly and in some cases, 
they are even hazardous for girls. Failure to provide adequate 
sanitary facilities and water services causes inconvenience for 
boys, but can make the situation disastrous for girls. During 
menstruation,  girls  will  not  attend  school  if  basic  toilet 
facilities  are  not  available.  Even  where  they  are,  servicing 
and  maintenance  are  frequently  poor.  In  many  places, 
separate facilities for boys and girls are not available, which 
leaves  girls  at  risk  of  sexual  harassment.  This  is  especially 
the case in those schools that become overcrowded, as they 
are too small or too few to serve expanding slum areas. The 
heightened  risk  of  sexual  violence  in  poor,  overcrowded 
classrooms  hinders  educational  prospects  for  girls.  More 
or  less  unwillingly,  girls  often  give  in  to  unwanted  sexual 
advances from boys or even teachers, leaving them exposed 
to  unwanted  pregnancies,  unsafe  abortions,  HIV/AIDS 
and other sexually transmitted diseases.50 The prevalence of 
such violence in schools hinders not only girls’ educational 
performance, but also their achievements, self-esteem and 
physical and psychological health. 

Against this background, Demographic and Health Survey 
data shows that a significant proportion of girls who drop out 
school do so because they “do not like it”. This is the case for 
more than 30 per cent of the young women in urban slum 
communities  in  Mali  and  Guatemala  who  had  left  school, 
and for more than 20 per cent in Egypt, Nicaragua, Central 
African Republic and Burkina Faso. Lack of safety at school 
can also, on its own, be a reason for parents to withdraw their 
daughters. In Dhaka, many parents keep their daughters at 
home and away from the city’s overcrowded schools, or marry 
them off at young ages, which, combined with motherhood, 
generally puts an end to any further schooling.51 It is incumbent 
on  policymakers  to  recognize  the  specific  vulnerabilities  of 
girls  in  schools  and,  through  a  set  of  minimum  standards, 
mainstream gender equality and protection across all aspects 
of education.52

More incentives needed for a universal basic education

Most  national  and  international  literacy  and  education 
programmes so far have focused on reducing the urban/rural 
gap  in  education,  overlooking  the  divide  between  rich  and 
poor that prevails in urban areas. Although much remains to 
be done in rural areas, these have seen significant increases 
in  enrolment  over  the  past  10  years,  and  the  simultaneous 
decreases in impoverished urban communities. In this regard, 
in Bangladesh as in many other countries, non-governmental 
organizations  have  traditionally  maintained  a  rural  focus; 
they have only recently begun to turn their attention to urban 
areas and to understand the particular educational challenges 
posed by slum populations. 

If school enrolment and achievement are to be improved in 
poor urban areas, a combination of incentives that stimulates 
both demand and supply is required. On the demand side, 
incentives for poor families can include stipends, scholarships, 
free  textbooks  and  learning  materials,  safe  and  affordable 
transportation schemes, and community awareness campaigns. 
On the supply side, it is for public authorities to build more 
secondary schools in poor urban areas or, alternatively, add 
boarding  facilities  to  existing  schools.  Furthermore,  direct 
linkages  between  secondary  education  and  local  work 
opportunities are required if graduates’ employment prospects 
are  to  be  enhanced.  This  type  of  scheme  can  boost  both 
enrolment  and  achievement  for  all  underprivileged  groups, 
including girls and children from poor urban areas. 

A comparison of the effects of eliminating school fees across 
several countries showed that enrolment rates rise dramatically 
wherever fees are abolished.53 Elimination of fees in Malawi in 
1994, for example, increased net enrolment from 68 to 99 per 
cent, and gross enrolment from 89 to 113 per cent in a single 
year. In Yemen, the government has launched cash and non-
cash incentive programmes based on school attendance, on top 
of specific incentives such as exemption from fees for textbook 
costs, with the deliberate aim of increasing girls’ enrolment and 
retention rates.54 The Yemeni government has also hired more 
female teachers and established a Girls’ Education Sector in the 
Ministry of Education, headed by a female deputy minister. 
During  the  same  period,  the  gain  in  boys’  enrolment  was 
more modest, at only 14 per cent. Trends in secondary school 
enrolment over the same period were similarly lopsided, with 
increases of 162 per cent for girls and 60 per cent for boys. 
However, changes in enrolment patterns have been found to 
be potentially detrimental if schools do not receive financial 
compensation for the loss of much-needed resources such as 
fees. In Yemen, the combination of increased enrolment and 
loss of textbook fees has led schools to complain about budget 
shortages, as fees provide the resources for everyday tasks and 
programmes. In this regard, income targeting is an alternative 
to  abolition  of  fees,  as  it  allows  cross-subsidization  between 
those families that can afford higher fees and those on lower 
incomes who cannot. However, this alternative is only available 
when  pupils  are  from  a  variety  of  backgrounds,  which  may 
be more unlikely in slum than in non-slum areas. The next 
best alternative is to help low-income families with the direct 

costs of education through conditional cash transfers and free 
transportation to school. 

It is also important to consider the “geographical dimension 
of inclusive education”, i.e., to pay more attention to inclusive 
education  at  the  local  and  national  levels.  Highlighting 
social  deprivation  at  the  local  level  provides  an  incentive 
for  policymakers  and  others  to  gain  better  understanding 
of  the  specific  situation  for  students  in  each  school,  and 
create  an  opening  for  community  participation  in  school 
improvement.55 

In this second part of the report, the focus has gradually 
narrowed,  from  the  characteristic  dimensions  of  the  urban 
divide and its current degree of prevalence across the world 
to its most tangible effects on those that have most to suffer 
from exclusion on a day-to-day basis. Overall, the evidence 
points to a continuum of deprivations on the wrong side of 
the urban divide, and they all call for redistributive change. 

This  and  the  four  preceding  chapters  have  highlighted 
various aspects of the paradox – some would say the scandal 
– that characterizes too many urban areas in this early 21st 
century. Cities concentrate what has become known as the 
“urban advantage”, namely, a bundle of opportunities which, 
from  basic  and  health  services  to  education,  amenities  and 
gainful employment, have never been so favourable to human 
development.  At  the  same  time,  in  the  developing  world, 
cities  also  concentrate  higher  degrees  of  inequality  than  in 
rural areas – the urban divide. In fact, standards in slums and 
other  low-income  urban  settlements  can  be  as  low  as  they 
remain in the countryside. 

The other paradox – or scandal – of early 21st century cities 
is  that  not  only  do  the  benefits  associated  with  urban  life 
keep eluding the poorer segments of their populations, but 
these opportunities are more particularly denied to women 
and young people, who have such obvious vital roles to play 
in  our  collective  future.  This  is  why,  as  the  continuum  of 
urban deprivations described in each chapter has increasingly 
focused on the physical impact of slums and poverty on the 
bodies and minds of ordinary human beings, the number of 
recommendations  for  public  authorities  has  also  increased 
and gained in urgency in this Report. 

Just as Part 2 identifies the failings and inadequacies in eco-
nomic and social policies that lie behind the urban divide, 
Part 3 reintroduces the political and cultural dimensions of 
equality  in  order  better  to  focus  on  remedies.  The  current 
state of urban inequality may represent only a transient phase 
in  a  broader,  economics-driven  dynamic;  still,  the  ongoing 
waste of human capital and the attendant risks of social and 
political instability should act as incentives to make that tran-
sition as short as possible through redistributive change. As 
discussed in Part 3, bridging the urban divide calls for a more 
holistic vision–the “inclusive city”. Whether or not a munici-
pality formally endorses the concept of the “right to the city”, 
a rights-based approach has two related benefits: it can put 
policymakers in a better position to identify the specific dy-
namics of integration at work locally, and to activate the vari-
ous types of leverage that can bring about an “inclusive city”.

2  For a better understanding of hunger and food 

deprivation in urban areas, UN-HABITAT has analyzed 
Demographic and Health Survey and Multiple Indicator 
Cluster Survey data on child nutrition in Africa, Asia and 
Latin America and the Caribbean. Child malnutrition 
is assessed here as including both acute malnutrition 
(wasting) and chronic malnutrition (stunting). A child 
can be underweight for her or his age because s/he has 
suffered from “wasting”, “stunting” or both. Wasting 
may	be	the	result	of	inadequate	food	intake	or	recent	
episodes of illness causing loss of weight and the onset 
of malnutrition.

3  The wealth index measurement is used here to stratify 

the urban population into quintiles (poorest, second 
quintile, middle, fourth, and richest).

4  This analysis only includes countries with at least two 

sets of DHS data.

27  Where population density is low, and where soils 

can absorb water easily (e. g. sandy soils with a low 
groundwater	level),	some	form	of	septic	tank	has	
been found to provide a safe and economic method 
of	sewage	disposal.	The	tank	itself	does	not	treat	
the	sewage,	and	the	water	flowing	out	of	it	is	highly	
contaminated; it is the soil into which the contaminated 
water	flows	that	does	the	real	‘filtering’	of	the	sewage.	
However, where the water coming out of a septic 
tank	system	cannot	be	absorbed	by	the	soil	(and	
therefore runs along the ground), the system becomes 
a	significant	environmental	health	hazard	and	a	septic	
tank	is	no	longer	appropriate.	Septic	tanks	should	not	be	
located	too	close	to	drinking	water	supplies	and	pipes,	
as	any	leak	is	liable	to	contaminate	drinking	water.	

28  Research on overcrowding in low-income settlements 

conducted	by	UN-HABITAT	in	1995	confirmed	that	
infectious	diseases	are	likely	to	thrive	in	overcrowded	
and	low-income	areas	due	to	lack	of	ventilation	and	
hygiene as well as unhealthy environmental exposures. 
Supportive evidence has shown that diseases run 
rampant in crowded places.

Romieu, & Bruce, 2000; Engle, Hurtado & Ruel, 1997.
30  Potential harm is the greatest for children under one 
year, since their lungs and immune system are not 
yet fully formed. Household use of biomass fuels has 
been	found	to	significantly	increase	the	risk	of	acute	
respiratory	infections,	which	annually	kill	millions	of	
children	under	age	five	(Smith,	Samet,	Romieu,	&	Bruce,	
2000).

31  Raffensperger, 2007. Human exposure to these 

pollutants indoors is compounded in homes with close 
quarters and poor ventilation. Even low levels of indoor 
air pollution can negatively affect health because of 
the proportionally large amount of time families spend 
indoors.	For	that	reason,	researchers	now	take	into	
account not only pollutant concentration but amount of 
time spent in each environment, calculating individual 
“time-activity patterns”. Using this metric, the number 
of people exposed at unacceptable levels indoors is 
equivalent to or greater than the number exposed to 
unacceptable levels outdoors in all the world’s cities 
combined (Smith, Samet, Romieu, & Bruce, 2000). 
Though no international standards for indoor air pollution 
exist, studies show that daily average levels of small 
particles in households that burn solid fuels are six to 
60 times the World Health Organization air pollution 
guidelines (Rehfuess, Mehta & Prüss-Üstün, 2006).

Quick Facts 

1.  The “right to the city” concept has been put to 
use to varying degrees of success over the past 
half-century, although some countries have 
ignored or spurned it altogether.

2.  The “right to the city” must not be viewed as a 
new legal instrument, but instead subsumes a 
wide range of universally recognized human 
rights into a single claim for enforcement in 
urban areas.

3.  Many cities in the developing world devise 
and enforce inclusive policies that abide by 
national and international commitments without 
any explicit reference to the “right to the city.” 

4.  Whether they formally endorse the “right to 
the city” or not, many municipal authorities 
are institutionally ill-equipped to make this 
right effective, including when it comes to 
coordination with national and state/provincial 
government.

Policy Points 

1.  Individual or collective economic 

marginalization frequently extends to access 
to social services, cultural expression and 
political participation.

2.  The “right to the city” can provide municipal 

authorities with the platform they need for 
a wide range of policies and initiatives that 
promote an “inclusive” urban environment.

3.  A strong human rights-based approach 

upholds the dignity of all urban residents in the 
face of multiple rights violations, including the 
right to decent living conditions. 

4.  The right to the city calls for a holistic, balanced 

and multicultural type of urban development, 
including mixed neighbourhoods. 

5.  The basic principle behind the right to the 

city is that human rights are interdependent 
and indivisible, i.e., they are to be pursued 
simultaneously, if only achieved gradually over 
time. 

6.  Municipal rights-based approaches must be 
deployed in all policy areas, including land 
use, planning, management and reform, and in 
close cooperation with government bodies and 
civil society. 

3.1

Taking forward the 
right to the city
The “urban advantage” for all

As  described  in  Part  2,  various  lines  of  divide 

combine  to  deprive  large  numbers  of  residents 
from access to many of the opportunities cities 
have to offer - the “urban advantage”. The often 
vital  contribution  of  those  in  low-earning  jobs  to  urban 
prosperity  is  not  properly  recognized  not  just  in  economic 
but also civic, political, cultural and other terms. They can 
neither fully realize their productive potential nor participate 
effectively in the decisions that impact on their lives. They are 
not socially integrated and often carry the stigma of the urban 
area where they reside. They are also denied opportunities to 
contribute to the city’s cultural life and style.

How  do  cities  close  the  urban  divide?  How  do  they 
become  more  inclusive,  economically,  politically,  socially 
and culturally? What principles, platforms and strategies can 
public  authorities  deploy  to  bridge  the  current  divide  and 
make cities more inclusive?  These are the questions virtually 
all the regions of the world are facing in this early 21st century, 
whether  highly  developed,  emerging,  in  transition  or  post-
conflict situations. They are as relevant to highly centralized 
nations and to those with devolved government, East, West, 
North and South.

The  concept  has  been  deployed  differently  in  various 
regions, countries and cities of the world. Some places have 
applied  the  “Right  to  the  City”  as  a  theoretical,  political, 
conceptual  framework  that  refers  to  such  aspects  as 
enforcement,  empowerment,  participation,  self-realization, 
self-determination,  and  different  forms  of  protection  of 
existing human rights at the city level. In other places, the 
concept  is  absent  from  the  political  discourse,  either  not 
used at all, or banned outright.  Where the concept has been 
applied, it has not always achieved higher levels of inclusion; 
large  numbers  of  people,  particularly  in  the  developing 
world, do not fully benefit from the “urban advantage”, do 
not participate in decision-making and do not enjoy effective 
fundamental  rights  and  liberties,  while  others  do,  live  in

BOx 3.1.1: “PaRTiciPaTioN” aND “ciTizENSHiP”: laTiN aMERica’S aMBigUoUS RHEToRic

RaqUEl RolNiK

In  Latin  America  over  the  past  few  decades,  an 
intense debate has enthralled civil society, political 
parties and governments–one over the role played 
by citizens in urban governance. Those years were 
also	marked	by	the	pursuit	of	a	decentralized	model	
and	stronger	local	autonomy.	Some	significant	le-
gal	breakthroughs	are	worthy	of	note	in	connection	
with the right to housing and the right to the city: 
several	 national	 constitutions	 and	 statute	 books	
(such as with the City Statute in Brazil) have come 
to include the principles of the social function of 
the city and property, the recognition of occupa-
tion  rights  for  millions  of  slum  dwellers,  and  the 
empowerment	of	citizens	in	urban	decisionmaking.	
This rights-based approach has been advocated by 
social movements, non-government organizations, 
trade  unions,  and  academic  or  research  institu-
tions, as part of campaigns in favour of democratic 
municipal management and the right to the city. 
This,  in  turn,  came  as  a  response  to  one  of  the 
fastest and most intense social and geographical 
phenomena ever witnessed: the massive reshap-
ing of a typically rural into a predominantly urban 
population in fewer than 40 years (up until 1980). 
This was when urbanization in Latin America saw 
vast contingents of poor rural migrants run against 
a  model  of  urban  development  that  typically  ex-
cluded the lower-income segments of the popula-
tion, depriving them from any sense of citizenship 
or local belonging. 

The “agenda of urban reform” has subsequently 
been  endorsed  over  time  by  Brazil’s  political 
parties  and  governments.  At  the  same  time, 
though, Latin American cities, and large metro-
politan	areas	in	particular,	came	under	the	influ-
ence of the neoliberal macroeconomic reforms 
that burgeoned in the early 1990s, resulting in 
massive unemployment and the erosion of so-
cial institutions. The process only exacerbated 
already existing social and economic asymme-
tries, ultimately hindering the capacity of pub-
lic	authorities	and	social	stakeholders	to	cope	
with  them.  These  reforms  extended  to  the 
whole  government  sector,  including  privatiza-
tion of public utilities, plans to modernize and 
downsize  government,  introduction  of  entre-
preneurial  management,  and  a  “participatory” 
rhetoric  emphasizing  the  role  of  civil  society. 
A	 kind	 of	 “perverse	 convergence”	 brought	
together–if  only  in  a  shared  rhetoric–various 
political  projects  that  pointed  out  to  different 
directions.  The  participatory-democratic  proj-
ect has its origins in the challenge to authori-
tarian regimes, and ambitioned to build a new 
institutional reality to pave the way for a new 
social  and  cultural  dispensation.  Now  collec-
tively dubbed “the third sector” (alongside the 
government	and	market	sectors),	civil	society	
was	caught	up	in	a	movement	that	looked	to	
downsize government in the name of “partici-
pation” and “citizenship”. 

The  shared  rhetoric  conceals  differences  and 
minimizes antagonisms, emphasizing social, po-
litical and territorial fragmentation while diluting 
the	promise	of	a	full-fledged	democratic	endea-
vour in the form of full and universal access to 
civil, political, economic and social rights. As far 
as	urban	development	models	are	more	specifi-
cally  concerned,  the  rhetoric  of  “participation” 
and “citizenship” implies that all citizens, regard-
less of income, ethnicity, race, creed or gender, 
are entitled to full access to the goods, services 
and  opportunities  that  are  locally  available  for 
the purposes of human development. 

For  about  two  decades  now,  urban  reform 
across  Latin  America  has  had  its  ups  and 
downs,  hostage  as  it  was  to  both  this  novel 
rhetoric  and  an  enduring  legacy  of  predatory 
territorial management by the more privileged. 
The  “participatory”  rhetoric  has  failed  to  pave 
the way for the dynamic relationship with main-
stream political parties that could have boosted 
the quest for more cohesive, inclusive and sus-
tainable cities. On the other hand, the rhetoric of 
“participation”  and  “citizenship”  has  continued 
to challenge urban policies in Latin America. As 
such, it has been a source of cultural innovation 
and  civic  rights  promotion,  and  has  expanded 
the spatial and political scope of Latin American 
democracy.

An architect and urban planner, Raquel Rolnik was appointed United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Right to Adequate Housing in 2008.

decent, healthy and environmentally friendly places with full 
exercise of their citizenship. Some other countries have made 
important efforts to close the urban divide without the overt 
use of the concept. Despite these ambiguities, the “Right to 
the City” remains a powerful vehicle for social change that 
warrants serious consideration.

What follows is a review of the “Right to the City” as it 
has been applied explicitly and implicitly in various regions, 
countries and cities. An effort is made to discern key principles 
that underlie the concept so that these might inform efforts 
by  cities  to  promote  inclusion  and  close  the  urban  divide, 
even  in  regions  where  the  historical,  political  and  cultural 
conditions are not conducive to an explicit application of the 
“Right to the City” approach. The chapter reviews the factors 
that limit the ability of cities to translate policy into effective 
practice.    These  include  poor  coordination  among  tiers  of 
government,  absence  of  data  for  informed  policy  choices, 
influence  of  vested  interests,  weak  adjustment  to  changing 
economic conditions, exclusion of marginalized groups and 
discrimination of minorities.  

Evolution of the right to the city

The  right  to  the  city  has  evolved  over  the  past  50  years 
under  the  influence  of  social  groups  and  civil  society 
organizations in response to the need for better opportunities 
for all, especially the more marginalized and underprivileged. 
In  2004,  social  movements  and  organizations  from  around 
the  world  together  devised  a  World  Charter  on  the  Right  to 
the City, with support from UNESCO and UN-HABITAT, 
among  other  agencies.  This  in  turn  led  to  the  adoption  of 
local charters in a number of cities. 

The right to the city should not be viewed as a new legalistic 
instrument, but rather as an expression of the deep yearnings 
of urban dwellers to see their multiple human rights become 
more effective in urban areas.1 In this perspective, the right 
to  the  city  serves  as  a  bulwark  against  the  exclusionary 
types  of  development,  the  selective  benefit-sharing  and  the 
marginalization and discrimination that are rampant in cities 
today. The right to the city provides an adequate platform for 
action as well as a framework for human rights enforcement.

So  far,  few  countries  or  cities  have  given  formal,  explicit 
recognition to the right to the city in those of their policies, 
strategies or legislations that look to narrow the urban divide. 
Brazil  was  the  first  country  to  include  in  its  Constitution 
(1988) a specific chapter on urban policy. Coming in response 
to years of dictatorship, this progressive body of law called 
on  municipal  authorities  to  deploy  a  range  of  instruments 
that could guarantee the right to the city, uphold the social 
function of cities and property, and make urban management 
more  democratic.2  At  nationwide  level,  Brazil’s  City  Statute 
(2001) is a groundbreaking body of legislation that redefines 
the  concept  of  land  ownership  as  it  asserts  the  social  value 
of urban land.3 In São Paulo, the largest city in the country, 
experts surveyed by UN-HABITAT concurred that “talking 
about  rights  is  talking  about  the  right  to  the  city”.4  One 
expert  defined  this  right  as  “the  equal  enjoyment  of  cities 
within the principles of sustainability, democracy and social 
justice”. Furthermore, “a city is a collective space, culturally 
rich and diversified, that belongs to all residents. The right 
to the city is an important entitlement to be claimed for by 
all those groups, both mainstream and marginalized, that live 
and interact in the city”.5 

Still  in  Latin  America,  in  2008  Ecuador  recognized 
several housing-related rights in its new Constitution.6 This 
pioneering,  progressive  statute  simultaneously  endorses:  (1) 
the right to the city; (2) the right to adequate and dignified 
housing;  (3)  the  right  to  a  secure  and  healthy  habitat;  and 
(4)  the  right  to  water  and  sanitation.7  Responding  to  the 
UN-HABITAT survey, an expert from Portoviejo, Ecuador, 
commented  that  “the  right  to  the  city  [stood  for]  broad 
and  unrestricted  access  to  services,  opinions,  freedom  of 
movement and access to space and economic opportunities”. 
He added that “this right is, in its broader sense, endorsed by 
decisionmakers, as well as recognized and implemented by the 
community in everyday life through widespread practice.” 8 

Many other cities in the developing world devise and deploy 
policies  in  compliance  with  national  legal  commitments  to 
more inclusive communities, and although they fall short of 
explicit references to the right to the city per se, they endorse 
some particular aspects of the notion. For example, Rosario, 
Argentina‘s third largest city, has declared itself a “Human Rights 
City” with a formal commitment to openness, transparency 
and accountability. The municipality has opened itself up to 
scrutiny by a citizens’ committee that monitors performance 
against  international  law  on  a  continuing  basis,  making 
recommendations  and  organizing  human  rights  training 
and  awareness  campaigns.9  Another  commendable  example 
is  the  Victoria  Charter  of  Human  Rights  and  Responsibilities 
(2006)  in  Australia,  which  “recognizes  that  everyone  is 
equally entitled to participate in, and contribute to, society 
and (the) community”. The charter further sets out that “all 
individuals have equal rights to the provision of, and access 
to, Council services and facilities”.10 The purpose of the 20 
rights that are recognized in the Victoria charter is to “assist 

all people to live in freedom, respect, equality and dignity”. 
The practical rationale is to secure effective rights recognition 
in  all  municipal  planning  and  policymaking  functions, 
anticipating on and preventing human rights infringements. 
This is why the Charter “requires all public authorities and 
their employees to act in compatibility with human rights in 
the delivery of services and when making decisions”.11 

Relevant urban policies and practices integrate aspects of 
democratic governance that are either explicitly or implicitly 
consistent with the “right to the city” concept. For instance 
in  Dakar,  municipal  leaders  and  local  authorities  in  2003 
endorsed a “Civic and Citizens’ Pact” which sets out reciprocal 
responsibilities  among  signatories.  The  pact  commits 
municipal authorities to acknowledge the diversity of cultures 
and beliefs among all residents; conversely, community-based 
organizations have agreed to act in a socially responsible way.12 
In India in 2001, a municipal authority has enacted a largely 
similar  “Citizens  Charter”  that  redefines  its  own  functions 
in  relation  to  residents’  rights  and  expectations,  with  due 
regard for the need for reform and to hear public grievances.13 
This  repositioning  of  municipal  authorities  was  pioneered 
in the 1980s by the Brazilian city of Porto Alegre , with its 
participatory budgeting (Orçamento Participativo) on which 
over 70 cities around the world have since modeled their own 
procedures.14  In  2004  came  another  improvement,  known 
as  the  Local  Solidarity  Governance  Programme;  this  scheme 
further  entrenches  participatory  budgeting,  with  all  Porto 
Alegre residents invited to sit in forums where projects for the 
next city budget are proposed and prioritized. The programme 
is implemented across the city’s 17 municipal subdivisions, 
turning Porto Alegre into a “networked participatory city”.15 
A number of cities in India, Ghana, South Africa, Colombia, 
Brazil, Ecuador, Peru and other Latin American countries are 
also taking forward the right to the city concept in a variety 
of spheres (social, economic, political and cultural). However, 
progress  is  often  rather  slow  and  sometimes  runs  into 
continuous setbacks. This is the case in Mexico and Argentina, 
where various efforts keep stalling because the four dimensions 
of the inclusive city are not involved simultaneously. In some 
cities and countries, particularly in South-Eastern and Eastern 
Asia and North Africa, economic growth policies have gone 
hand  in  hand  with  positive  social  developments  such  as 
broad provision of basic services, improved literacy and life 
expectancy rates, and reductions in the prevalence of hunger 
and  extreme  poverty.  These  cities  enjoy  a  decent  quality  of 
life; however, political rights and freedom are lagging behind. 
The Washington, D.C.-based non-governmental organization 
Freedom House (in its annual Freedom in the World report) 
rates some of those countries as “not free” (North Africa and 
East  Asia)  or  “partly  free”  (Morocco  and  South-East  Asia 
(except  “free”  Indonesia).  Still,  other  cities  and  countries, 
mainly in sub-Saharan Africa and Western Asia, are looking 
to  deploy  legal  and  political  frameworks  based  on  equality 
and rights.

Factors restricting the right to the city: 
The disjuncture between policy aims and processes

For  all  their  noteworthy  efforts,  those  municipalities 
committed to a “right to the city” approach and those that 
have  pursued  other  concepts  of  inclusion  share  a  common 
feature,  namely,  a  certain  disjuncture  between  policy  and 
process.  Few have managed fully to turn policies aims into 
processes that actually bridge the urban divide and achieve 
more inclusiveness. 

Part of the problem lies in a wide range of pressures, in-
cluding urban expansion (or various forms of contraction, as 
the  case  may  be),  historical  socioeconomic  inequalities  and 
grinding  poverty,  together  with  environmental  degradation 
and natural disasters as compounded by the effects of climate 
change,  among  other  threats.    This  is  particularly  the  case 
with those cities in the developing world that experience seri-
ous resource constraints and lack the inclusive mechanisms 
and institutions required to bridge the urban divide. These 
cities have not yet devised proper programmes or initiatives 
to  reduce  inequality  and  tackle  service  shortfalls;  they  lack 
the mechanisms that would enable them to understand and 
anticipate some of the factors generating further inequalities 
(i.e., scarcity of land and concentration of ownership in very 
few hands; lack of redistributive policies; ineffective housing 
markets, etc.). Leaders in these cities have not demonstrated 
the  strength  of  vision  or  political  commitment  needed  to 
overcome  the  urban  divide.  Even  cities  with  a  stronger  re-
source base are also struggling to implement more inclusive 
policies.  They  are  typically  hampered  by  five  main  factors: 
(1) weak institutions, often with outdated mandates and re-
sponsibilities; (2) multiple agencies, operating together with 
overlapping functions and poor results; (3) lack of adequate 
human and financial resources; (4) poor performance of fiscal 
and administrative systems; and (5) lack of harmony between 
political and technical interests, which results for instance in 
unethical planning practices or budget allocations to non-pri-
ority areas. Various other factors also hinder efforts to bridge 
the  urban  divide,  contributing  both  to  the  cause  and  con-
sequences of poor policies and ineffective urban governance.
In  some  cities,  the  disjuncture  between  policy  aims  and 
processes  is  not  only  the  result  of  limited  institutional  and 
organizational capacities; it also has to do with rent-seeking 
groups that lobby for their vested interests to the detriment of 
other residents, as highlighted in the UN-HABITAT survey. 
Moreover,  policy  aims  and  processes  often  do  not  match 
because  they  fail  to  acknowledge  the  inter-linkages  among 
the four spheres or dimensions of the inclusive city. This in 
turn has to do largely with the persistent view of development 
as synonymous with economic growth, with little attention 
paid  to  other  dimensions  of  inclusiveness  such  as  the  need 
for distributive policies, more effective channels of social and 
political participation, and recognition of cultural diversity. 
The  problem  with  development  strategies  has  been  that 

they  view  development  as  a  technical  problem  requiring 
technical  solutions,16  instead  of  a  systemic,  organic  process 
that  includes  all  four  critical  dimensions  of  society.  Any 
degree  of  recognition  that  is  given  to  the  four  dimensions 
at  the  policymaking  stage  is  often  lost  in  the  process  of 
implementation.  UN-HABITAT  policy  analysis  found  that 
cities frequently adopt new laws and regulations to address 
some  exclusion-related  issues,  but  these  fail  to  turn  into 
goalposts, sustained processes or tangible results that can be 
monitored. The reason for this disjuncture often lies in the 
institutional  frameworks  themselves:  over  time,  they  tend 
gradually to embed negative and rather inefficient attitudes, 
as well as informal social arrangements that are impervious 
to  change.  This  is  most  evident  in  the  lack  of  planning 
and  coordination  among  central,  regional  and  municipal 
institutions in Africa, Asia and Latin America. 

Lack of coordination between national, provincial and 
local authorities

Table  3.1.1  shows  that  an  overwhelming  majority  of 
cities  surveyed  across  the  three  regions  of  the  developing 
world feature very poor coordination for both planning and 
implementation  on  urban  issues  across  national,  provincial 
and municipal governments (first column left). Data in the 
table  also  confirms  the  weak  linkage  between  coordination 
for planning and coordination for implementation (middle 
column), with fewer than 25 per cent of respondents from 
cities in Latin America and Asia reckoning that coordination 
was  effective  among  the  three  tiers  of  government.  This 
comes as a reminder that even where municipal authorities 
develop  elaborate  master  plans  with  some  kind  of  support 
from regional and central government, these are not matched 
by budget allocations or the organizational or technical skills 
that  would  ensure  that  implementation  effectively  involves 
the three tiers of government. 

For  instance,  the  master  plan  for  Abuja,  Nigeria’s  capital 
since 1991, was consciously designed in 1979 by various tiers 
of  government  with  help  from  a  foreign  consultancy,  and 
underwent further, multi-agency revisions after the year 2000. 
At the design stage, the master plan provided the platform 
needed to bridge the divide between rich and poor, making 
adequate provisions for inclusion in its different dimensions. 
Still, the process of turning the dream into reality is running 
into  serious  problems.  As  one  of  the  local  respondents  to 
the  UN-HABITAT  survey  commented,  “implementation 
is  not  inclusive  socially,  politically  or  economically”.17  The 
high degree of institutional coordination among government 
agencies  and  various  partners  in  the  design  stage  has  gone 
missing during the implementation phase.

Table 3.1.1 also shows that large majorities of experts in 
Asia  and  Latin  America  and  the  Caribbean  reckon  there  is 
hardly  any  coordination  for  planning  and  implementation 
between the three tiers of government (third column right). 
On the other hand, and somewhat surprisingly, only 41 per 
cent of experts in Africa report a lack of such coordination in 
their respective cities. This relatively favourable return reflects 
the fact that the survey sample includes Accra, Dakar, Durban 
and  Johannesburg  –  four  cities  where  well-coordinated 
planning  and  implementation  is  supported  by  adequate 
efforts and resources. 

Surveyed experts perceived coordination among government 
agencies to be more effective for the promotion of economic 
growth and inclusion than for cultural and political inclusion. 
Findings  were  that  central  governments  tend  to  formulate 
and implement national policies and programmes with only 
some minor degree of involvement by local authorities as far 
as political and cultural inclusion is concerned. In some other 
cases, however, these initiatives originate with local authorities, 
but regional and central government shows little support or 
interest to collaborate. As a result, coordination is far from 
uniformly effective across the four dimensions that make up 
an inclusive city: some plans and actions related to economic 
and  social  development  and  inclusion  tend  to  be  better 
coordinated  than  those  for  cultural  and  political  inclusion, 
which typically tend to attract only poor coordination. This 
is confirmed again by UN-HABITAT survey returns, which 
show that lack of policy focus (on all aspects of inclusion, as 
opposed to the mere promotion of economic opportunities) 
and absence of political will are two of the most critical factors 
hindering municipal inclusion policies in the three developing 
regions (see Table 3.1.2).

Making informed policy choices

substantially 

In  addition  to  lack  of  clear  institutional  coordination, 
ill-informed  policymaking  contributes 
to 
municipal failure to integrate the four dimensions of equality 
in any “organic” manner. The UN-HABITAT survey sought 
to capture the extent to which informed policymaking was 
an essential part of slum upgrading policies in the 27 cities 
under review. The finding is that fewer than 50 per cent of 
survey  respondents  across  Africa,  Asia  and  Latin  America 
and  the  Caribbean  thought  that  slum  upgrading  policies 
were  informed  and  based  on  sound  local  data.  This  result 
corroborates previous UN-HABITAT research as part of the 
Urban  Indicators  Programme,  where  80  out  of  120  cities 
surveyed admitted to lacking the institutional capabilities and 
human skills required to monitor urban growth. Municipalities’ 
lack of technical skills is a reflection of a more general state of 
national underdevelopment. The 2009 UN-HABITAT survey 
found that Latin American cities were better equipped than 
those in Asia, which in turn outdid Africa. Even where some 
degree  of  institutional  capacity  can  be  found,  institutional 
inertia in resource-poor environments leads to gradual erosion 
of any processes that promote coordination. Those institutions 

whose mandates involve urban planning and implementation 
are, more often than not, keener to preserve their respective 
turfs and assert their self-importance than to focus on proper 
planning and urban harmony.

Interest group influence

In  the  27  cities  surveyed  by  UN-HABITAT,  powerful 
political and interest group influences were found to interfere 
with inclusive urban policies. These influences frequently take 
different forms that can be illustrated with two examples: (1) 
poor  provision  of  public  spaces  and  related  services  for  all 
residents, and (2) arbitrary conversion or grabbing of public 
or reserved land by powerful interests. For example, religious 
groups in India are erecting temples in public parks; private 
interests  in  Bangladesh  are  constructing  massive  real  estate 
developments along riverbanks; and developers and informal 
settlers  in  Nairobi,  Kenya  are  constantly  claiming  riparian 
lands.  Undue  appropriation  of  critical  public  spaces  by 
private entities often goes unnoticed, or is even promoted by 
municipal authorities. Similarly, changing the status of land 
from rural to urban on the periphery of expanding cities is 
typically  associated  with  speculative  investments  by  those 
better-off,  and  almost  automatically  excludes  the  poor  and 
underprivileged. 

In  the  city  of  Guadalajara,  Mexico,  recent  research 
confirmed the findings of the UN-HABITAT survey. Because 
of relentless expansion of developments on the outskirts of 
the city, some 30 per cent of this new housing stock remains 
unoccupied,  even  as  in  the  inner  city  a  similar  percentage 
goes  underused.18  This  situation  highlights  the  speculative 
patterns of investment at work, which are largely influenced 
by  powerful  interests.  The  experts  responding  to  the  UN-
HABITAT survey pointed to the urban rich, political elites 
and civil servants as the interest groups that most benefit from 
urban expansion and reform. Table 3.1.3 shows that 59 per 
cent of Latin American, 69 per cent of Asian and 71 per cent 
of  African  respondents  viewed  urban  reforms  and  changes 
as serving the interests of the rich. Similarly, politicians and 
bureaucrats are viewed as the second major group benefiting 
the most from the urbanization process, with the exception 
of  Africa  where  they  are  considered  to  be  the  greatest 
beneficiaries (77 per cent). This goes to show that the urban 
poor in general stand to share only to a minimal extent, if at 
all,  in  any  benefits  accruing  from  urbanization  and  related 
reforms. The survey findings reflect the relatively more stable 
and  accountable  forms  of  democracy  prevailing  in  Latin 
American as opposed to Asian and African cities. They also 
point to the extent of misallocation of scarce budget resources 
to non-priority areas as a result of interest group influences. 
More  generally,  planning  and  policies  appear  to  favour 
the empowered, mainly local and regional economic elites. 
In  the  developing  world,  this  pattern  is  more  often  than 
not associated with historical and cultural hegemony, which 
adds to the inter-generational aspects of urban exclusion that 
lead to spatial partitioning and gentrification. Moreover, in

addition to gentrification, a number of other large projects 
and events have created urban environments that are of little 
benefit to the poor. These have included large infrastructure 
projects  (water,  sanitation  and  roads),  “city  beautification”, 
riverfront  development  schemes  and  facilities  for  major 
global sports and cultural events. 

Building facilities for cultural mega-events has on occasion 
led to the resettlement of underprivileged communities (Seville 
1992, Shanghai 2010), as have political mega-events (Manila 
1976, Seoul 1985), or sporting mega-events such as the Olympic 
Games,  World  Football  Cup,  Commonwealth  Games  and 
other regional events which, in some cases, can result in some 

forms of discrimination and inequality, such as forced evictions 
of people living in slums and informal settlements to make 
way for infrastructure development (Beijing 2008, New Delhi 
2010, Vancouver 2010). These sporting mega-events can also 
result in displacement of homeless people (Osaka 2002, Seoul 
2002). Each of these events has more indirect consequences 
as  well.  For  example,  infrastructure  improvements  through 
redevelopment  can  lead  to  decreases  in  the  public  housing 
stock  and  an  escalation  in  real  estate  prices,  which  makes 
housing  unaffordable  for  many  low-income  residents  and 
other marginalized groups. The desire to “show off” a city and 
make it an attractive tourist destination is often accompanied

by a process of “sanitization”, i.e., a “clean-up” of public areas 
that  is  facilitated  by  criminalization  of  the  homeless   and 
increased brutality by police forces. Rebuilding a city’s image 
appears,  from  the  examples  of  many  mega-events,  to  mean 
making it more attractive for local, national and international 
elites (middle- and high-income earners), and as a result, less 
livable for those who fall outside these categories.19
 
The most excluded groups: A typology

A review of the various forms of exclusion and the layers 
of  horizontal  discrimination  in  selected  cities  shows  that 
multiple forms of discrimination overlap at any given time. 
As one of the experts from Latin America commented as part 
of  the  UN-HABITAT  survey,  “when  one  is  [economically] 
poor, one is also poor and excluded in a cultural, social and 
political  sense”.20  Indeed,  survey  results  have  shown  that 
when an individual or group is marginalized from economic 
opportunities, it is very likely that this condition extends to 
access  to  social  services,  expression  of  cultural  identity  and 
participation in political life. Exclusion in this sense “results 
from a complex and dynamic set of processes and relationships 
that prevent individuals and groups from accessing resources, 
participating in society and asserting their rights”.21

Individuals and groups can find themselves excluded from 
the right to vote, the right to enter and enjoy all areas of the 
city, the right to use social and cultural facilities and venues, 
the right to access basic services, and various other rights which 
effectively restrict their full enjoyment of the right to the city. 
It is worthy of note that, from a list of categories or groups 
(women and children, the elderly, the disabled, uneducated 
people, migrants, ethnic groups and other minorities in terms 
of race or caste, people on low incomes and slum dwellers), 
three appear to be the most systematically excluded in various 
cities in Asia, Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean: the 
disabled,  the  elderly  and  slum  dwellers,  followed  by  the 
uneducated (for African cities, see Figure 3.1.1). In cities like 
Dakar,  Mombasa,  Abuja,  Chittagong,  Kathmandu,  Dhaka, 
Port-au-Prince and Buenos Aires, slum dwellers are the most 
excluded from the various urban functions. 

Exclusion  is  entrenched  and  rooted  in  the  long  history 
of  marginalization  and  hierarchy  that  permeates  the  social 
patterns of individual cities. The urban poor, and slum dwellers 
in particular, go unnoticed and the places where they live are 
often not formally recognized by local or central authorities. 
However, in many parts of the world these “invisible” areas 
are growing faster than the “visible” ones.22 Excluded groups 
in slum areas typically fall victim to a sort of triple jeopardy: 

(1) they are poor and uneducated; (2) many are migrants or 
from ethnic minorities; and (3) many are female. As long as 
municipal authorities remain unaware of these groups and the 
underlying causes of their exclusion, they will remain unable 
to find effective ways to support them, and will fail them in 
a systematic way. 

If  city  authorities  are  effectively  to  address  the  needs  of 
these  and  other  excluded  groups,  they  must  recognize  that 
their systematic marginalization is unfair and avoidable – a 
wholesale denial of their “right to the city”. This calls for in-
formed discussions, negotiating support and proposing poli-
cies and actions that tackle the root causes and persistence of 
disadvantage, marginalization and exclusion. Municipal au-
thorities must also devise a number of short- and long-term 
strategic responses to be delivered by all relevant organizations 
and institutions as part of anti-exclusion policies, with proper 
monitoring  mechanisms.  Otherwise,  cities  will  persistently 
fail to acknowledge, uphold and fulfil the rights of all the in-
dividuals under their jurisdictions. 

Co-evolution of policies with urban expansion and needs

Cities  are  constantly  changing.  They  are  built,  rebuilt, 
transformed and inhabited by various groups, and used for 
various functions. In this sense, planning comes as an attempt 
to bring some order to this constant process of transformation. 
However, the evolution of cities in the developing world is 
under pressure from the multiple forces that make it difficult 
for planners and decision-makers to manage. As urban labour 
market structures steer away from manufacturing to services 
and high technology, it is important to provide the working 
poor with opportunities to retrain for jobs in the new growth 
sectors.  The  UN-HABITAT  survey  highlights  a  relative 
predominance of manufacturing and unskilled labour across 
the three regions under review. However, Asian cities feature 
far higher percentages of service and high-technology workers 
compared  with  Africa,  Latin  America  and  the  Caribbean. 
Unskilled jobs, including in the services sector, are, by nature, 
less well-paid than high-technology jobs, and people in these 
categories  tend  to  be  economically  underprivileged.  Also 
needed  are  economic  and  fiscal  incentives  to  support  the 
economic transition process, particularly for small enterprises. 
However, in many cities these support schemes lag behind the 
economic transition process because of resource constraints, 
weak  institutions  and  inadequate  policies.  This  is  how  and 
why cities struggle to catch up with these structural changes, 
leaving  large  sections  of  the  population  behind  and  in  the 
process exacerbating the urban divide.

*For example, labour-intensive infrastructure development.

Table  3.1.4  shows  that  policies  in  support  of  urban 
economic change are lacking in Asia and Latin America. Local 
experts responding to the UN-HABITAT survey found that 
African  cities  provided  relatively  more  vocational  training 
(23  per  cent),  a  perception  that  largely  reflects  tangible 
achievements  in  Accra  and  Ibadan.  Elsewhere  in  Africa, 
though,  vocational  training  clearly  falls  short  of  improving 
the  labour  market.  Likewise,  local  experts  reported  that 
promotion  of  employment  through  simplified  procedures 
was not happening in Latin American or African cities, and 
remained  rather  minimal  in  Asia.  Deregulation,  incentives 
and more favourable regulations were equally found lacking 
in  Latin  America  and  Asia,  while  Africa’s  relatively  better 
ranking was entirely due to Johannesburg’s strong individual 
performance. Another significant way of reducing inequalities 
of income and opportunities is state-created employment, a 
major source of labour-intensive jobs for unskilled or semi-
skilled  workers.  UN-HABITAT  survey  respondents  ranked 
state-created employment higher than other factors, though 
still  relatively  low.  Although  well-adapted  to  the  needs  of 
the urban poor (see Ch.3.3.), labour-intensive, state-created 
employment  may  not  facilitate  the  adaptation  of  the  local 
labour market to the novel types of jobs generated by new, 
growing economic sectors. 

A  comparison  of  employment  trends  with  available  job-
generating  factors  makes  the  case  for  dedicated  policy 
instruments at the city level in order better to distribute the 
benefits  of  prosperity.  In  close  coordination  with  national 
government, dedicated municipal policies have the potential 
to provide targeted, context-specific solutions. Short of this, 
a city denies residents access to decent jobs and, indirectly, 
the  right  to  adequate  housing  and  other  public  goods  and 
amenities,  which  together  are  fundamental  aspects  of  the 
right to the city.

planning,  management  and  implementation.  The 
right	 to	 the	 city	 calls	 for	 acknowledgement	 and	
protection of all human rights such as self-determi-
nation, freedom of assembly and organization, and 
the right to personal and collective development.

BOx 3.1.2: THE PRiNciPlES UNDERlyiNg THE “RigHT To THE ciTy” 
The right  to  the  city  calls  for  a  holistic,  balanced 
and  multicultural  type  of  development.  This  in-
cludes mixed neighbourhoods, as opposed to gated 
communities	for	the	rich,	“city	beautification”	or	re-
newal schemes which all forcibly relocate the poor 
to	the	urban	fringes.	Urban	working	classes,	who	
build	cities	and	keep	them	operating	smoothly,	are	
entitled  to  adequate  housing  and  basic  services, 
too.  Their  living  conditions  must  be  gradually  im-
proved, in situ as far as possible, instead of being 
exposed to forced evictions and displacement. The 
contribution of the poor to a city’s economy must 
be	acknowledged	and	laws	should	not	discriminate	
against them in favour of the rich. 

Non-discrimination and inclusion. Rights must 
be  guaranteed  to  all  those  –  including  women, 
youth	 and	 children	 –	 who	 choose	 to	 make	 the	
city  their  home,  irrespective  of  economic  status, 
identity, caste, class, race, gender, religion, sexual 
inclination, occupation or civil status, and regard-
less of whether they are legal residents or formal 
“citizens.”  Cities  must  create  enabling  environ-
ments that provide equal access or entitlement to, 
and enjoyment of, basic and public services, public 
spaces	and	all	kinds	of	benefits	and	opportunities	
for everyone. Cities must prevent social segrega-
tion,	 gentrification,	 social	 apartheid,	 criminaliza-
tion of the poor and the homeless, as well as the 
increasing “ghettoization” of urban spaces that is 
becoming widespread across the world.

calls for special protection of, and priority to, the 

The right to the city is a vision for an alternative, 
adequate and ideal city. It is not merely the right to 
any	city,	especially	not	to	cities	the	way	we	know	
them today, but instead one where mutual respect, 
tolerance, democracy and social justice prevail. The 
right to the city incorporates four major principles.

indivisibility  of  Human  Rights.  The  basic  prin-
ciple of the right to city is that human rights are 
interdependent and indivisible, i.e., they are to be 
realized simultaneously. All human rights – civil, po-
litical, economic, social, cultural and environmental 

rights of the more marginalized groups: women, 
the  elderly  and  disabled,  slum  dwellers,  the  un-
educated, migrants, etc. Cities must cater to the 
needs and rights of those belonging to historically 
discriminated	 groups,	 including	 through	 affirma-
tive action where needed (with close monitoring 
of outcomes). The right to the city implies a strong 
commitment to poverty reduction and the removal 
of discriminatory legal and policy provisions.

gender Equality. The right to the city is also the 
right to a “gendered city” ensuring equal protec-
tion  and  realization  of  women’s  human  rights. 
Women’s participation in city planning and gover-
nance is critical to any balanced, equitable urban 
development. Municipal authorities must develop 
and implement policies in close consultation with 
women	to	ensure	they	fully	benefit	from	the	”ur-
ban  advantage”  –  including  health,  education, 
decent  employment,  adequate  housing,  equal 
access to both public and private spaces, public 
transport,	streets,	sidewalks,	markets,	parks,	toi-
lets	(both	public	and	private),	workspaces,	politi-
cal spaces, and community spaces, all in a safe 
environment.

Taking	the	right	to	the	city	forward	is	not	an	easy	
task.	The	current	reality	is	that	this	right	is	effective	
only for certain segments of society, with the eco-
nomic and political power that affords those the full 
benefits	of	the	“urban	advantage”.		Cities	all	over

must	take	into	account	the	following	six	critical	as-
pects if they are to guarantee an effective right to 
the city for all.

financial	resources	are	to	be	reformed.	Municipal	
authorities  must  also  collect  disaggregated  data 
on	key	indicators,	with	a	view	to	achieving	higher	
human rights standards and monitoring their own 
performance in this respect. 

Harmonization of local and national laws with 
international human rights standards. Any lo-
cal  and  national  laws  and  policies  such  as  those 
related  to  land  acquisition,  urban  master  plans, 
housing and resettlement must be consistent with 
the  principles  of  international  human  rights  law. 
On top of this, new legislation that guarantees ad-
equate housing, protection against forced eviction, 
and  rights  to  education,  health,  water  and  basic 
services, should be enacted where needed. Inter-
national guidelines relevant to urban development 
and equitable distribution of resources should also 
be incorporated in laws and policies. Government 
action  must  be  harmonized,  integrating  various 
tiers  and  municipal  departments  to  ensure  that 
public policies and decisions fully comply with rec-
ognized human rights.

Need  for  human  rights-based  urban  reform. 
Short  of  a  human  rights-based  reform  of  munici-
pal  policies,  the  urban  divide  cannot  be  bridged 
and the right to the city cannot become effective. 
A comprehensive urban land reform agenda must 
be developed with participation from government 
agencies and civil society. This agenda must detail 
the	way	land	use	rules,	planning,	decision	making,	
budgeting, zoning, housing and equitable access to 

Need  for  strong  municipal  political  will  to 
grant  human  rights  and  endorse  the  World 
charter on the Right to the city. In close consul-
tation with civil society, local and municipal authori-
ties should endorse the Charter and all the human 
rights set out therein. 

Plans  and  strategies  for  the  simultaneous 
realization of rights for all groups, especially 
those  marginalized.  Urban  planning  should  be 
participatory,  inclusive  and  representative  of  a 
comprehensive cross-section of interests and so-
cial  diversity,  with  special  attention  for  economi-
cally	weaker	and	marginalized	groups.

Walking	 through	 the	 streets	 of	 Amman,	 Jordan,	
one	 is	 nearly	 as	 likely	 to	 pass	 by	 a	 person	 from	
Iraq  or  the  Occupied  Territories  of  Palestine  as  a 
Jordanian.  At  least  500,000  of  Amman’s  2  mil-
lion residents (see Figure 3.1.2) have come to the 
city	seeking	refuge	from	conflicts	and	disasters	in	
their	own	countries,	making	it	the	world’s	number	
one urban safe haven. No other city in the world is 
known	to	have	taken	in	such	a	large	number	of	ref-
ugees, yet many Iraqis and Palestinians sheltered 
there	strive	to	keep	a	low	profile	to	avoid	detention	
or	expulsion	–	risks	faced	by	those	who	enter	the	
country illegally, and by those perceived as threats 
by  authorities  striving  to  maintain  security,  eco-
nomic stability and the provision of public services 
in  an  increasingly  congested  urban  environment. 
Amman’s education and health care systems have 
been particularly burdened by the huge numbers of 
refugees	who	have	flocked	to	the	city	since	2003,	
and most of those also displaced there are jobless. 

The issues refugees and city authorities are grap-
pling with in Jordan’s capital are becoming more 
and more commonplace around the world, as peo-
ple displaced from their homes increasingly cross 
borders	 seeking	 personal	 security	 and	 access	 to	
services in cities. One out of every two refugees, 
like	a	significant	proportion	of	internally	displaced	

persons  (IDPs),  now  live  in  an  urban  area,  ac-
cording to the United Nations High Commissioner 
for  Refugees  (UNHCR).  According  to  the  agency 
an	 estimated	 36	 per	 cent	 of	 all	 known	 refugees,	
displaced	 people,	 asylum	 seekers	 and	 returnees	
combined, or more than 7 million people, resided 
in urban areas by the end of 2008. 

also displaced tens of thousands of people in Ma-
laysia  and  Kenya,  where  Kuala  Lumpur  and  Nai-
robi  have  become  home  to  between  30,000  and 
46,000 refugees and displaced people. The cities of 
Luanda,  Kinshasa,  Delhi,  Panama  City,  Khartoum, 
Kampala and Sana’a all host between 15,000 and 
26,000 people of concern to UNHCR. 

While 16 per cent of all people displaced to cities 
have	 taken	 refuge	 in	 the	 developed	 world,	 more	
than 70 per cent, or 5.3 million, now reside in cit-
ies of the developing regions, particularly Western 
Asia, sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia. Strong 
economies are more capable of absorbing those in 
need of special assistance; yet the burden is dis-
proportionately borne by the cities that can least 
afford	it,	often	located	in	conflict-prone	regions.

As “outsiders,” refugees and displaced people tend 
to  be  more  vulnerable  to  discrimination,  violence 
and  exploitation  than  their  counterparts  living  in 
organized  camps.  Even  inside  urban  IDP  camps 
in cities such as Khartoum, however, life remains 
precarious.  In  2004,  more  than  80  per  cent  of 
displaced families in the Sudanese capital lived in 
temporary shelters made out of plastic and paper, 
which	were	regularly	flooded.	That	same	year,	the

government’s urban planning strategy for Khartoum 
led to the demolition of more than 13,000 houses, 
schools  and  health  facilities  in  IDP  settlements, 
forcibly evicting thousands of families and creating 
a  homelessness  crisis  in  the  city.  Between  2003 
and  2007,  more  than  300,000  displaced  house-
holds  in  Khartoum  became  homeless  after  their 
houses  were  demolished  for  planning  purposes. 
Forced  relocations  have  resulted  in  violence,  ar-
rests and deaths of displaced people.

Urban displaced people’s vulnerability is increased 
by the legal limbo in which they typically live, includ-
ing absence of secure housing, land and property 
rights. In Colombian cities as in the Somali capital, 
Mogadishu, urban warfare forces frequent intra-ur-
ban displacement and contributes to slum growth.

For refugees in a foreign country, the situation can 
be even worse. Those without documents are vul-
nerable to exploitation by landlords, employers and 
others.  Without legal status, access to the judi-
ciary	comes	with	the	risk	of	expulsion.	The	urban	
displaced	are	also	among	those	most	likely	to	be	
affected by food crises. 

Not all displaced people become part of the visible 
urban	poor	living	in	slums;	a	significant	proportion	is	
absorbed into the urban fabric, effectively becom-
ing  hidden  in  the  host  city.  In  several  countries, 
the whereabouts of documented refugees are un-
known	altogether,	making	aid	and	service	provision	
for them nearly impossible. Avoiding the attention 
of authorities comes at the cost of worse housing 
and health conditions. 

UNHCR	does	not	know	the	whereabouts	of	all	peo-
ple of concern displaced to cities. Some major host 
countries are able to report the urban proportion of 
displaced persons within their borders, but not the 
specific	cities.	In	the	Syrian	Arab	Republic,	for	ex-
ample, UNHCR estimates that the total number of 
people of concern living in urban areas exceeds 1.1 
million.  The  population  of  urban  displaced  people 
in Somalia’s South Central region alone – including 
Mogadishu – also exceeds 1 million, though it is 
unknown	whether	all	of	the	displaced	people	are	
living in the capital city. The absorption of refugees 
and  displaced  people  into  the  urban  fabric,  their 
dispersal  over  large  cities  and  their  high  mobility 
combine  to  inhibit  not  just  service  provision,  but 
also	policymaking	and	associated	research.

3.2

The regional 
dynamics of 
inclusion
Building on strengths

The  previous  chapter  has  analysed  the  “Right 

to  the  City”,  highlighting  its  potential  as  a 
general template for municipal efforts to bridge 
the  urban  divide  and  pave  the  way  for  more 
inclusive cities, and reviewing the challenges that face rights-
based approaches in general. Such approaches take in the four 
dimensions of urban exclusion or inclusion, as well as their 
various linkages. This chapter highlights the diverse, specific 
dynamic interactions between these political, economic, social 
and cultural dimensions in the world’s three major developing 
regions, as perceived by the local experts who participated in 
the UN-HABITAT policy analysis in 27 representative cities.
If planners, municipal officials and other stakeholders are 
to recognize the urban divide in all its four dimensions and 
facilitate a prompt and sustainable transition from a partially 
to a completely inclusive city, then they must build upon the 
existing strengths that together represent the specific “urban 
advantage”  of  their  own  cities.  Just  like  the  factors  behind 
the urban divide, these specific strengths can be of a social, 
economic, cultural or political nature. It is for policymakers to 
identify those strengths in a comprehensive assessment of local 
assets in order to collect all the information they need to make 
progress toward broad-based inclusiveness. Such an assessment 
should include the operational and practical resources, both 
formal  and  informal,  which  the  various  stakeholders  can 
contribute  to  achieve  the  redistributive  change  required  to 
bridge the urban divide. At the same time, there can be no 
hiding that this endeavour is likely to run up against at least one 
of three major institutional and political challenges: (1) local 
authorities may not be committed to reducing inequality; (2) 
the three tiers of government (national, provincial and local) 
may be poorly coordinated, if at all; and (3) local and central 
authorities may lack an overall strategic vision, including on 
the best ways of closing the urban divide. 

The  four  dimensions  of  the  urban  divide  –  social, 
economic,  political  and  cultural  –  are  frequently  found 
to overlap. The linkages among the four dimensions are of 
a substantive though so far ill-defined nature. The findings 
of  the  UN-HABITAT  survey  of  27  cities  featured  here  are 
significant  because  they  make  it  possible  to  shed  light  on 
some of the inter-relationships at work in urban centres in the 
three major developing regions of the world. Among other 
findings, the survey shows that any government committed 

Quick Facts 

1.  Economic inclusion in cities is associated with 

different factors in every major developing 
region: planning and political will in Africa; 
government-induced jobs and legal certainty 
in Asia; and democratic institutions and 
freedom of the press in Latin America and the 
Caribbean.

2.  Urban social inclusion is linked with freedom 
of expression in Asia; employment, political 
progress and free cultural expression in Latin 
America and the Caribbean; and multiparty 
elections and freedom of expression in Africa. 

3.  In Asian and African cities, improvements in 

social inclusiveness are closely associated 
with the political role of non-governmental 
organizations.

4.  Beyond multiparty elections and freedom of 
the press and expression, political inclusion 
is driven by other factors in cities, including 
freedom of cultural expression and the 
empowerment associated with micro-credit.

5.  In both Asian and African cities, poverty is an 
impediment to cultural participation, which in 
Latin American cities is favoured by equitable 
employment, fiscal incentives and micro-
credit.

6.  Government health care programmes 

appear to be an effective way of reducing 
marginalization and other types of urban 
inequality.

7.  Social infrastructure, such as waste collection, 
recreational facilities, public parks and open 
spaces, benefits few people in most African 
cities, where public transport is a very effective 
way of reducing inequalities.

to promoting inclusiveness should act in a proactive way on 
all these dimensions, since they are linked together. Analysis 
of  the  survey  results  has  identified  a  number  of  dynamic 
associations among them which municipal and other public 
authorities can use as guidelines in their own efforts to foster 
more inclusive cities. 

economic inclusion and its links to 
social and political inclusion

Regardless of the achievements of individual cities as hubs 
of prosperity, genuinely inclusive economic progress leading 
to an equitable allocation of opportunities and income is, to a 
very large extent, determined by the specific political, cultural 
and social equality parameters of any given city. As reviewed 
below, the findings from 27 cities in three developing regions 
surveyed – Africa, Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean 
–  unanimously  corroborate  the  dynamic  inter-relationships 
between economic inclusion on the one hand, and political 
and cultural equality in cities on the other hand.

In the three subsections below, “Africa”, “Asia”, “Latin America 
and the Caribbean” refer to the relevant cities under review.

Africa: Economic inclusion is associated with planning 
and political will 

The survey results from the seven African cities under review 
suggest that any economic inclusiveness they have to offer is 
associated with two elements: (1) the degree of coordination 
(where any) among the planning functions of local, provincial 
and national government, (2) the active involvement of non-
governmental organizations calling for stronger political will 
and advocating freedom of expression and other human rights. 
Whereas in several Asian and Latin American cities, economic 
dynamism  is  under  strong  influence  from  recent  structural 
changes such as the rise of banking and telecommunications 
services,  this  phenomenon  is  not  so  prevalent  in  the  seven 
African cities included in the UN-HABITAT survey. Except 
for  Mombasa  and  Ibadan,  these  cities  are  national  capitals 
where  government  is  a  major  provider  of  jobs.  Though 
not  a  capital,  Ibadan  is  a  university  town  and,  as  such,  to 
a large extent also relies on the public sector for formal job 
opportunities. Still, even in Ibadan, as in Accra and (at least 
partially) in Abuja, the predominant source of opportunities 
for formal employment has shifted from the civil service to the 
private sector, where (as in some Latin American and Asian 
cities)  banks  and  telecommunications  companies  provide 
both skilled and semi-skilled jobs.1 

In the African cities under review, the apparent association 
between  civil  society  advocacy  in  favour  of  the  poor  and 
economic  inclusiveness  comes  in  response  to  the  extensive 
rent-seeking  and  dominance  of  rich  people  and  politicians 
in  urban  economies.  On  top  of  calling  for  government 
action  and  militating  for  human  rights,  non-governmental 

Policy Points 

1.  Africa’s national, local and municipal 

authorities must improve coordination of their 
planning and implementation functions if the 
urban divide is to be narrowed across the 
continent.

2.  A healthy, well-educated population is a 

major asset for any city, and knowledge is a 
prerequisite for enhanced civic participation in 
the social, political and cultural spheres.

3.  Bridging the social divide in Asia will 

require greater collaboration between 
non-governmental organizations and poor 
communities, with advocacy organizations 
playing an even more proactive role in the 
political sphere, as is already the case in Latin 
American cities. 

4.  The empirical link between democratic 

governance and social inclusion highlights 
the need for institutions and enforcement 
mechanisms favouring participatory decision-
making, while guaranteeing effective free 
speech and freedom of the press.

5.  Cities should encourage anything that can 

foster multiple and complementary identities 
in order to reduce any polarization among 
groups, particularly in a multi-cultural, multi-
linguistic, multi-ethnic type of society. 

6.  Recognition of cultural diversity entails the 
deployment of spaces and conditions that 
favour various forms of active participation, in 
accordance with the different societal, cultural 
and organizational forms that characterize any 
specific population.

BOx 3.2.1: MaiN FEaTURES oF THE 27-ciTy SURvEy
The  concept  of  the  “inclusive  city”  provided 
the  rationale  for  the  questionnaire  at  the  core 
of  the  UN-HABITAT  survey  and  policy  analysis. 
As	 defined	 in	 this	 Report,	 an	 “inclusive	 city”	 is	
one that, regardless of race, ethnicity, gender or 
socio-economic status provides all residents with 
adequate housing and decent basic services, fa-
cilitating  equal  access  to  social  amenities  and 
public  goods  that  are  essential  to  promote  the 
general  and  environmental  well-being  of  every-
one (social inclusion). An inclusive city protects 
citizens’ rights and freedom, and promotes social 

and political participation that contributes to rel-
evant	and	democratic	decision-making	(political 
inclusion).  An  inclusive  city  fosters  economic 
development  by  way  of  equal  opportunities  for 
business and access to employment, promoting 
pro-poor economic policies (economic inclusion). 
An inclusive city promotes social integration and 
celebrates  diversity.  It  values  people’s  cultural 
rights, recognizing the human capital of all seg-
ments of society, and strives to enhance them 
by promoting creative expression in the arts and 
heritage activities (cultural inclusion).

The questionnaire captured all these dimensions 
succinctly,  along  with  the  institutional  and  or-
ganizational  issues  that  are  critical  to  effective 
equality  and  equity  in  cities.  The  questionnaire 
submitted to some 400 experts on three conti-
nents covered the following:
(1) General information; (2) inclusion and inequal-
ity in the relevant city: general issues; (3) eco-
nomic equality and inclusion; (4) social equality 
and  inclusion;  (5)  political  equality  and  access; 
(6) cultural equality and expression; (7) additional 
information.

* In Durban, South Africa, an expert provided background documents on inclusiveness that were largely used in this Report.

organizations  look  to  mobilize  urban  communities  in 
favour of accountability. In many African cities, the private 
sector  is  largely  controlled  by  the  political  and  economic 
elites,  and  human  rights  advocacy  is  to  be  interpreted  as 
calls  to  democratize  the  business  sector  in  order  to  open 
opportunities  to  all.  Survey  responses  from  a  majority  of 
African cities confirmed that the benefits of prosperity were 
unequally  shared  across  various  social  segments.  A  large 
number of respondents felt that in the seven cities, current 
efforts to generate employment opportunities fell well short of 
providing hope to those who are economically marginalized. 
Therefore,  in  the  African  cities  under  review,  poor 
government  management  of  the  economic  sphere  seems  to 
come as an outgrowth of weak institutions and inadequate 
regulatory  frameworks;  these,  in  turn,  incite  greater  civil 
society involvement on behalf of the poorer and marginalized 
segments  of  the  local  population.  This  finding  highlights 
the  important  (though  hitherto  largely  ignored)  role  of 
social and  political inclusiveness when it comes to fostering 
economic  inclusiveness  and  harmony  in  cities.  In  such 
circumstances,  civil  society  adds  an  economic  function  to 
its  more  conventional  political  and  social  roles;  to  put  it 
in  economic  terms,  transaction  costs  are  reduced  for  local 

communities when organized civil society steps in to enhance 
grassroots  awareness  of  economic  rights  and  opportunities, 
and  to  bypass  formal  institutional  arrangements  for  easier 
delivery of services at relatively low cost.2 However, in some 
circumstances,  bypassing  formal  institutional  arrangements 
can result in parallel structures that weaken the role of public 
authorities, which in turn can jeopardize government capacity 
for adaptation and delivery in the long run. 

This  apparent  linkage  between  the  economy  on  the  one 
hand, and social and political activism on the other, provides 
much-needed  evidence  in  support  of  the  call  for  a  more 
holistic, multi-dimensional approach to an inclusive city.

economic and industrial policies as well as by infrastructural 
development.3  In  Delhi,  Jaipur  and  Mumbai,  more  than 
half  the  survey  respondents  concurred  that  government-
induced employment was a very effective way of addressing 
inequalities of income and opportunities. 

The survey also suggests that in the 10 Asian cities under 
review, freedom of expression is also strongly associated with 
economic inclusion. While this may seem surprising at first 
glance,  Asia’s  changing  employment  patterns  support  this 
finding. A gradual transition from manufacturing to services 
and  high  technology  (information  and  communication, 
pharmaceuticals,  biotechnology,  and  electronics)  has  only 
been  made  possible  through  the  availability  of  technically 
qualified  and  highly  skilled  workers.  Subsequent  economic 
prosperity has been characterized by increases in incomes and, 
concomitantly, an expanding middle class (especially in India). 
This socioeconomic transformation has been accompanied by 
greater demands not just for improved social and economic 
conditions, but also for transparency and accountability.4 

The  powerful  apparent 

linkage  between  economic 
inclusiveness  and  freedom  of  expression  corroborates  the 
theory of cultural change, which poses that the more a society 
becomes  industrialized  and  reliant  on  skilled  work  and 
technology, the more chances that the concomitant shift in 
values will in turn bring new societal changes, including more 
democratic politics.5

Latin America and the Caribbean: Economic inclusion 
is associated with democratic institutions and freedom 
of the press 

In the 10 Latin American and Caribbean cities under review, 
multiparty  democracy  and  freedom  of  the  press  seem  to  be 
strongly  associated  with  economic  inclusiveness.  For  all  the 
significant  strides  democratic  governance  has  been  making 
in  the  region  generally,  the  survey  suggests  that  political 
institutions,  rule  of  law  and  accountability  do  not  always 
work properly; to put it another way, they still fall short of 
the expectations of urban populations.6 Therefore, reform of 
government institutions, modernized public policies and novel 
forms of participation (particularly those related to freedom of 
the press and multiparty elections) are of crucial importance 
if  poor  economic  performance  is  to  be  improved.  In  Latin 
America as in Africa, the strong association between economic 
inclusiveness and advocacy for democratic rights can be seen 
as an effort to tackle rent-seeking and curb the formation of 
interest group coalitions that could restrict economic benefits 
and opportunities to only a few specific segments of society. 
Political  calls  to  amend  dysfunctional  social  and  economic 
institutions  are  echoed  in  survey  respondents’  perceptions 
that  in  Latin  American  cities,  urban  policies,  reforms  and 
decisions benefit the rich by up to three times as much as they 
do slum dwellers and the poor.  In Bogotá, Callao, Cartago, 
Curitiba,  Oruro  and  São  Paulo,  more  than  90  per  cent  of 
the experts surveyed concurred that the economic prosperity 

of their respective cities was not well apportioned among the 
various social segments. For all this quasi-unanimity, though, 
respondents could not agree on which particular groups were 
the main beneficiaries of formal income-generating activities 
and employment opportunities.

Furthermore, although a majority of respondents reckoned 
that  their  respective  cities  were  addressing  inequalities  of 
income and opportunities through specific programmes and 
policy initiatives, they were of the view that only two types 
of  policies  –  government-induced  creation  of  specific  forms 
of  employment,  and  micro-credit  –  were  the  most  effective 
mechanisms in this regard. Other measures such as vocational 
training to enable skills development, streamlined procedures 
for improved access to employment and new rules to promote 
jobs,  were  considered  to  be  rather  ineffective,  as  were  fiscal 
incentives.  The  poor  results  of  public  authorities’  efforts  to 
curb inequality in Latin American and Caribbean cities can be 
largely explained by lack of political will among government 
officials, poorly focused programmes and, to a lesser extent, 
inadequate civic participation. 

Social inclusiveness calls for a multidimensional approach

As mentioned earlier, Africa’s national, local and municipal 
authorities must improve coordination of their planning and 
implementation functions if the urban divide is to be narrowed 
across the continent. Survey findings strongly suggest that the 
existing,  rather  moderate  degree  of  planning  coordination 
among  the  three  tiers  of  government  is  not  matched  when 
it comes to implementation. This largely inhibits municipal 
authorities’ ability to respond to the needs of the population. 
In  resource-poor  environments  such  as  those  prevalent  in 
the  three  regions  reviewed  in  the  UN-HABITAT  survey, 
local authorities rely on funding and technical support from 
state/provincial and central budgets to design and implement 
municipal  programmes.  In  such  circumstances,  any  lack  of 
coordinated implementation signals a significant lapse in the 
way institutions operate, and one that must be rectified. 

Coordination at all levels of government is critical to 
bridging the social divide

While  most  Latin  American  and,  to  some  extent,  Asian 
cities  under  review  appear  to  enjoy  better  coordination 
among national, state and local authorities, most of the seven 
African  cities  were  found  lacking  on  this  count.  Still,  the 
few  exceptions  identified  by  respondent  experts  are  worth 
mentioning.  In  Johannesburg,  for  instance,  city  leaders 
have  undertaken  effectively  to  grant  the  specific  social  and 
economic  rights  detailed  in  South  Africa’s  1996  Bill  of 
Rights,  going  beyond  mere  declarations  of  principles  and 
establishing  better  coordination  among  national,  regional 
and  local  authorities.  The  primary  purpose  was  to  address 
any  backlogs  in  the  provision  of  basic  services,  and  to 
extend access to water, sanitation and electricity to the entire

“Expanded  Public  Works  Programme”  to  promote  labour-
intensive infrastructure construction funded by national and 
local  budgets.  The  scheme  enabled  the  city  to  create  more 
than 1 million jobs in 2007 and 2008, an increase of no less 
than 546 per cent over the 2004/05 fiscal year.7 Similarly, in 
Accra, effective coordination of efforts and resources between 
central and local authorities has made it possible to extend 
the benefits of Ghana’s National Health Insurance Scheme to 
the bulk of the population, enabling local hospitals to extend 
treatment to the poor and vulnerable in the country’s capital. 
In contrast to Johannesburg and Accra, most of the other 
African cities under review were found deficient in terms of 
social inclusion mechanisms or proper integrated programmes 
and  policies  aimed  at  reducing  inequality  and  service 
inadequacies. In addition to basic services such as water and 
sanitation,  the  types  of  social  infrastructure  most  lacking 
in  African  cities  include  waste  collection  and  recreational 
facilities, public parks and open spaces. Survey respondents 
concurred  that  such  amenities  did  not  benefit  the  large 
majority  of  the  population  in  their  respective  cities.  Waste 
collection  is  also  a  severely  neglected  agenda  in  a  number 
of African cities. Here again, though, Accra stands out as a 
significant  exception,  with  provision  by  private  companies 
subject  to  scrutiny  and  supervision  by  public  agencies. 
Improvements are also expected in Johannesburg, owing to 
substantial increases in budget allocations for waste removal 
in  the  2009/10  municipal  budget.  Along  with  other  cities 
under review, South Africa’s economic capital clearly makes 
the case for city-specific or municipal approaches to resource 
mobilization that are based on improved coordination among 
all three tiers of government.

Health care is the most effective bridge over the 
social divide 

The  survey  clearly  suggests  that  government  health  care 
programmes are one of the most effective ways of reducing 
marginalization  and  other  types  of  inequality  that  are 
detrimental  to  the  more  vulnerable  urban  dwellers.  This  is 
particularly the case in Ibadan, where municipal authorities 
are working closely with federal and state health care services 
to  establish  Primary  Health  Centres  that  include  clinics, 
hospitals  and  dispensaries  in  various  areas.  The  facilities 
provide  prevention  and  treatment  and  are  also  involved  in 
research and collection of statistics.8 Likewise, in Accra, the 
three  tiers  of  government  are  establishing  clinics  in  most 
communities  and  suburbs  in  a  concerted  effort  to  extend 
provision of health services to all neighbourhoods. In both 
Ibadan and Accra, survey respondents concurred that health 
care  programmes  made  a  highly  effective  contribution  to 
narrowing  the  urban  divide.  These  findings  also  highlight 
a  major  policy  dimension:  the  focus  on  health  is  necessary 
and  important  per  se  in  African  cities,  but  also  comes  in 
response to the Millennium Development Goals. It is worth 

remembering here that some of these goals call for significant 
efforts  with  regard  to  education.  As  the  signatories  of  the 
Millennium Declaration agreed in the year 2000, a healthy, 
well-educated  population  is  a  major  asset  for  any  city,  and 
knowledge is a prerequisite for enhanced civic participation 
in the social, political and cultural spheres. 

Public transport reduces social inequalities in 
African cities 

Public transport features as the second most effective way of 
reducing inequalities in African cities, UN-HABITAT survey 
respondents suggest. This is important since nearly two-thirds 
of  responses  show  that  in  Africa  the  average  commute  by 
public transport from residence to workplace exceeds one hour. 
Again, Johannesburg and Accra stand out for good, egalitarian 
practice. In Johannesburg, the municipality has upgraded the 
existing rail system and introduced a new Bus Rapid Transit 
service to improve access to the city’s resources and services. 
The  subsidized  bus  network  does  not  just  extend  to  poor 
peripheral  residential  areas  that  were  inadequately  served 
before: it also connects them, crucially, both to workplaces and 
vocational training centres.9 In Accra, the Metro Mass Transit 
service has been improved with more connections both within 
the city and between the city and other urban centres, which 
facilitates affordable movement of people in various parts of 
the Ghanaian capital and the hinterland. 

Asia: Social inclusiveness is linked with freedom 
of expression 

In the 10 Asian cities under review, survey results suggest 
that improvements in social inclusiveness are closely associated 
with  the  political  role  of  non-governmental  organizations 
advocating  stronger  political  commitment  by  government, 
along  with  freedom  of  expression  and  other  human  rights. 
This  finding  confirms  the  view  that  as  non-governmental 
organizations extend their work to grassroots empowerment 
and  capacity-building,  the  poor  become  more  involved  in 
politics. 10 For example, in India, health, education and other 
social  welfare  functions  have  been  granted  constitutional 
status (either as a fundamental right or as a “directive principle 
for state policy”) largely as a result of civil society campaigns. 
In  Asia,  non-governmental  organizations  have  not  just 
grown  rapidly  in  numbers  over  the  last  30  years.  Their 
scope, in terms of sectors and population, has also expanded 
significantly. Today they are active in many areas including 
health, education, housing, basic service delivery, micro-credit, 
advocacy, empowerment and capacity-building. However, the 
strong link found between the degree of social inclusiveness 
and civil society’s political activism in the Asian cities under 
review clearly suggests that these organizations should play an 
even more proactive role in the political sphere; they could, 
for  instance,  encourage  the  citizenry  to  regroup  and  put 
public authorities under more pressure, as is already the case

in  Latin  American  cities.  Clearly,  Asian  non-governmental 
organizations must move beyond the conventional framework 
under which they have been operating so far. It is incumbent 
on them to explore new frontiers if they are to support the 
institutional  strengthening  required  to  promote  equality, 
political  rights  and  civil  liberties.11  This  is  essential  for  any 
bridging of the social divide. 

Asian  cities  have  experienced  general  improvements  in 
housing and access to basic services, including electric power, 
telephone  and  cable  facilities.  Still,  UN-HABITAT  survey 
findings point to huge disparities in service provision between 
rich and poor. This is particularly true with regard to sewage 
disposal and waste collection, where the gap in access creates 
a visible distinction between the “haves” and the “have nots”. 
In Bangladesh, more than 80 per cent of survey respondents 
in Dhaka, Khulna and Chittagong rated sewage disposal and 
waste  collection  as  either  “not  provided  at  all”  or  “poorly 
provided”. Dhaka, in particular, stands out for extensive land 
grabbing by a group of unscrupulous real estate companies 
and powerful local political leaders. As a result, the number 
of public spaces – parks, lakes, riversides, canals, playgrounds, 

graveyards and cremation grounds – has been decreasing. At 
the same time, development of private spaces such as country 
clubs, gymnasiums and amusement parks is booming, for the 
sole enjoyment of privileged groups. The net effect of these 
parallel developments is to reduce access to social amenities 
for the majority of the Dhaka population.12

Conditions in Asia are echoed in comments from survey 
respondents in African cities, where local experts were of the 
view that poor access, if any, to recreational facilities, public 
parks  and  free  spaces  for  social  activity  ranked  among  the 
deficiencies  in  social  infrastructure  that  contribute  to  the 
urban divide. 

An analysis of the results across the 27 cities under review 
clearly  suggests  that  lack  of  inclusive  development  policies 
is the main causal factor restricting the rights, opportunities 
and aspirations of the relatively weaker segments of society 
–  the  urban  poor,  women,  children,  the  disabled,  foreign 
immigrants,  and  some  ethnic  and  religious  minorities. 
Those  who  are  also  slum  dwellers  appear  to  be  even  more 
marginalized, with one-third of respondents rating them as 
specifically excluded and vulnerable (see Chapter 3.1).

UN-HABITAT  survey  results  point  to  the  main  fault  in 
municipal  social  integration  programmes,  namely,  their 
poor  focus,  or  altogether  absence  thereof.  Another,  related 
deficiency  is  lack  of  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  city 
performance, with lack of political will ranking third among 
the causes of inefficiency. 

This is where non-governmental organizations can play a 
complementary, supportive political role in social inclusion, 
as some are already demonstrating: they promote an inclu-
sive concept of the public interest, advocate for monitoring 
of programmes and policies, as well as for improved decision-
making and more focused policies that specifically target the 
underprivileged. In India, for instance, organized civil society 
and women’s groups are pushing political parties into main-
streaming women’s concerns in their platforms. In Thailand, 
civil society organizations call for the inculcation of trust in 
political  and  social  institutions.13  In  India  and  Bangladesh, 
non-governmental organizations stand for the human rights 
of the Dalit community, one of the most politically, socially 

and  economically  excluded  groups  in  the  two  countries.14 
However, in some Asian centralized economic and political 
regimes,  NGOs  are  likely  to  be  operating  in  tandem  with 
government interests, despite their rhetorical support of free 
expression of civil society and respect for human rights.

Latin America: Social inclusiveness through jobs, political 
progress and free cultural expression

In  the  10  Latin  American  and  Caribbean  cities  under 
review, survey results suggest that social inclusion is strongly 
associated with several policy variables, particularly in three 
areas:  change  in  existing  rules  to  promote  employment, 
improvements  in  political  governance,  and  freedom  of 
cultural expression. 

It comes as no surprise that employment promotion through 
regulatory  changes  should  be  strongly  linked  with  social 
inclusiveness in a region characterized by high unemployment 
in the formal economy and poorly paid jobs in the informal

sector. Any rare new formal job is either for the highly skilled 
and well-paid, or the unskilled and low-paid, and a majority of 
the Latin American and Caribbean population falls in between 
these two categories. The experts answering the survey were of 
the  view  that  an  enabling,  efficient  legal  framework  would 
stimulate formal job creation and, as such, was an essential 
pre-requisite for social and economic inclusion. As suggested 
earlier  in  this  Report,  lack  of  income  results  in  inadequate 
housing and minimum basic services, as well as poor access 
to the proper health, education and other social benefits that 
cities normally have to offer.

Against the background of the economic crisis and related 
massive  layoffs,  the  UN  Economic  Commission  for  Latin 
America  and  the  Caribbean  and  the  International  Labour 
Organization  have  estimated  that  over  the  course  of  2009, 
some  2.5  million  people  would  become  unemployed,  or  a 
1 per cent increase (to 8.5 per cent) in the unemployment 
rate worldwide.15 Although this projection makes the general 
prospects for more social and economic inclusion rather more 
dubious, protecting the population from such shocks remains 
a government prerogative. As an expert from Quito remarked: 
“A poor job or lack thereof interferes with the possibility of a 
full exercise of the right to the city, as it results in an absence 
not just of economic, but also social inclusion”.16 

Further empirical evidence from previous UN-HABITAT 
surveys and background documents shows that advancements 
in  political  governance  are  significantly  associated  with 
social inclusion, and particularly legal assistance, freedom of 
expression, freedom of the press and multiparty elections. 

Over  the  past  three  decades,  Latin  America  and  the 
Caribbean  has  made  enormous  progress  in  democratic 
governance, including in crucial areas like central government 
reform  (decentralization,  better  use  of  institutions),  social 
participation and democratic turnover of ruling parties and 
politicians.  This  is  why,  of  all  developing  regions,  Latin 
America  today  stands  at  the  forefront  for  participatory 
process  and  female  political  representation.17  In  a  number 
of cities, such progress has mainly come under the form of 
institutional  strengthening  and  participatory  budgeting. 
These  have  enhanced  links  between  democratic  governance 
and  human  rights  in  many  cities  and  countries.  Although 
civic rights appear to be secured in cities such as Bogotá, São 
Paulo,  Callao  and  Quito,  according  to  experts  only  three 
specific  groups  really  seem  to  benefit  from  urban  reforms, 
namely, civil servants, the wealthy and high-ranking officials. 
This is particularly true with regard to access to legal counsel 
and the courts. In Port-au-Prince, for instance, a single court 
is in charge of settling disputes and issuing birth, death and 
marriage certificates for 400,000 residents in one of the poorest 
neighborhoods, known as “Cité Soleil”.18 Where cities fail to 
deploy institutions and procedures that are more responsive to 
the needs of ordinary people (including the poor), exclusion 
and social inequality will continue to interfere with effective 
basic rights and liberties for everyone – a phenomenon that 
can pose threats to social and political stability. 

Democratic governance and social inclusion 
are inter-related

The  empirical  link  between  democratic  governance  and 
social  inclusion  highlights  the  need  for  institutions  and 
enforcement mechanisms that can bring more inclusiveness in 
decision-making, while guaranteeing effective free speech and 
freedom of the press. These are the basic social and political 
conditions enabling communities to raise their voice, and to 
ensure that their demands are heard and mainstreamed both 
in legal frameworks and policy decisions. More institutional 
engagement  from  organized  civil  society  seems  to  be  an 
essential  prerequisite  for  any  pro-poor  transformation  and, 
more specifically, for effective social integration programmes. 
Failure  to  provide  these,  experts  stress,  reflects  a  “lack  of 
political  will”  among  governments,  which,  alongside  “lack 
of appropriate focus of city programmes”, is the main factor 
behind poor social inclusion in the 10 cities under review in 
Latin America and the Caribbean. 

The  UN-HABITAT  survey  also  suggests  that  freedom 
of  cultural  expression  is  strongly  associated  with  social 
inclusion. It is worth noting here that several cities promote 
culture  as  a  means  to  achieve  social  inclusion.  This  is  the 
case in Bogotá, where culture builds collective identity and 
conviviality as an antidote to violence (the dominant conflict 
resolution mechanism), illustrating its potential role in social 
transformation.19  Uruguay  is  another  case  in  point,  with 
national  and  local  authorities  promoting  cultural  debate 
in  a  bid  to  instill  a  sense  of  democratic  dignity,  plurality, 
collective  advancement  and  learning  as  a  cornerstone  of 
social inclusion.20 

Political  inclusiveness  and  democratic 
governance

In the two subsections below, “Africa” and “Latin America and 
the Caribbean” refer to the relevant cities under review.

Africa: Political inclusion through multiparty elections 
and freedom of expression 

It comes as no surprise that freedom of expression and the 
press,  multiparty  elections  and  a  constitutional  guarantee  of 
cultural  expression  were  all  found  to  be  positively  linked  to 
political inclusiveness in the seven African cities under review 
– even though these components of democratic politics are at 
different stages of advancement across countries, and making 
relatively slow progress overall. 

For all the formal recognition that civil and political rights 
are  constitutional  rights,  implementation  is  poor  on  average, 
if not extremely scarce. In many African cities, though, some 
aspects of democracy such as proper election standards, viability 
of basic democratic institutions such as courts and legislatures, 
and social participation are becoming more dominant in the 
political discourse. It is also clear that over the past few decades,

demands for more local “voice” and involvement in decisions 
that  affect  living  conditions  have  become  more  pressing.  In 
general terms, though, urban residents remain sharply critical 
of  municipal  governance  and  management.  Experts  in  cities 
as  diverse  as  Nairobi,  Ibadan,  Dakar,  Abuja  and  Mombasa 
concurred  that  local  communities  were  neither  coordinated 
nor  sufficiently  empowered  to  make  effective  demands  on 
municipal institutions.21 They were of the view that political 
guarantees  like  access  to  legal  assistance  and  aid,  along  with 
civil society advocacy of political will, freedom of expression 
and human rights, were hardly or only moderately effective as 
they stood. 

As an expert in Abuja stated, “the city is dominated by the 
politics  of  the  rich  and  godfatherism”,  pointing  to  rampant 
political  patronage.22  In  Ibadan,  high-quality  residential 
areas  are  host  to  the  political  class  who  enjoy  what  one  of 
the  local  experts  called  the  “dividends  of  democracy”,  such 
as  proper  infrastructure,  employment  opportunities  and 
social  services.23  Another  expert  found  that  in  Nairobi, 
“the  municipal  leadership  does  not  generally  promote  civil 
participation or create accountability frameworks for overall 
municipal management”.24 

UN-HABITAT  survey  results  suggest  that  those  public 
administrations in charge of the welfare of urban populations 
lack both transparency and accountability. Experts rated as 
“very poor” the performance of these administrations. Even 
in  Nairobi  and  Mombasa,  and  as  in  Ibadan,  none  of  the 
experts  reckoned  that  municipal  officials  were  accountable 
or  “transparent”.  They  said  corruption  (as  defined  by  lack 
or  thorough,  regular,  independent  audits  and  transparent 
accounting  systems)  was  a  major  reason  for  these  failures. 
The  other  factors  behind  poor  municipal  performance 
identified  through  the  survey  included  inefficient  and 
ineffective  administrative  systems  and,  to  a  lesser  extent, 
discriminatory mechanisms that are particularly detrimental 
to the poor. In Africa, an overwhelming majority of expert 
opinion  concurred  that  these  practices  were  “facilitated” 
and exacerbated by lack of easy access to information, and 
whatever information available, even if limited, was typically 
found in the press. 

transparency  allows 

Poor  accountability  and 

some 
individuals, organizations and companies to secure significant 
economic  gains  without  reciprocating  any  benefits  back  to 
society.25 Experts have identified three special-interest groups 
as the beneficiaries of urbanization policies and related policy 
reforms:  politicians,  civil  servants  and  the  urban  rich  – 
whereas the urban poor and slum dwellers are systematically 
marginalized and rarely benefit from these policies. 

that 

Still, the UN-HABITAT survey has identified instances of 
more  responsive  public  administrations.  Ghana  and  Liberia 
have substantially enhanced civic participation in government 
selection, as well as freedom of expression, association and the 
media.26  Rwanda  has  made  progress  in  “strengthening  local 
government  structures  as  cornerstones  of  its  post-conflict 
recovery strategy”.27 As far as individual cities are concerned, 
Durban and Johannesburg are worthy of note, with innovative 
governance  mechanisms 
facilitate  participatory 
approaches. In eThekwini Metropolitan Municipality (which 
includes Durban), an efficient collective system of governance 
involves  an  executive  mayor,  sub-councils  and  wards. 
“Bridge  City  Thinking”  is  a  pioneering  programme  that 
addresses residential differentiation and aims to link different 
communities  across  the  whole  municipal  territory.  Both 
Durban and Johannesburg have substantially enhanced public 
participation in municipal budgeting and accountability. In 
this  respect,  Johannesburg  was  rated  as  the  most  effective 
African  city  by  the  experts  involved  in  the  UN-HABITAT 
survey.  This  top  regional  rating  remains  relatively  low  by 
comparison  with  other  regions;  however,  if  Johannesburg 
were to adopt its proposed “City Accountability Programme”, 
more  indicators  of  city  governance  would  become  available 
with  regard  not  just  to  budget  revenues  and  expenditures, 
but  also  the  tangible  results  of  the  city’s  efforts  to  promote 
democracy and freedom of expression. In the meantime, the 
Johannesburg municipality has already put in place an annual 
“satisfaction  survey”  enabling  households  and  the  business 
community to assess the effectiveness of city communication, 
performance  of  wards  and  community-based  planning. 
Although the resulting “satisfaction index” has slightly fallen 
in the last two years, the municipality continues to compile 
the numbers and to disseminate the results.

for  lack  of  both  adequate  financial  resources  and  properly 
trained staff. 

In the majority of the 10 cities surveyed in Latin America and 
the Caribbean, it is clear again that according to local experts, 
two specific social groups are protected by city authorities and 
are disproportionately taking advantage of urbanization: the 
wealthy (owners of real estate and construction companies, 
developers and land speculators), and civil servants. Positive 
exceptions can be found, though, as in Quito, Portoviejo and 
Cartago where, in the words of an expert from Quito, “the 
actions of both national and local governments benefit society 
in general, and in recent years have ensured that these benefits 
were geared to the poor. However, in practice, the results are 
not so widespread or so positive, due to the shortcomings and 
deviations that occur when running urban programmes and 
implementing reforms”.29 

Under national constitutions, freedoms of association and 
expression are recognized civic rights, but survey respondents 
reckoned  effective  social  participation  was  very  poor.  Most 
concurred  that  this  dearth  of  participation  results  from  a 
widespread  belief  among  the  citizenry  that  they  are  in  no 
position to change or influence policy decisions. The other, 
50
by now familiar determinants behind poor participation have 
50
%
to  do  with  policymakers:  poorly  focused  programmes  and

lack of political will. In Bogotá, a survey of political culture 
conducted by the National Statistics Office in 2008 showed 
that  lack  of  time  and  information  were  the  main  reasons 
behind poor participation in politics and municipal affairs, 
followed by mistrust of institutions.30 Further factors behind

poor  social  participation  may  also  include  the  decreasing 
role  played  by  conventional  political  parties  and  the  weak 
legitimacy of the institutions in charge of elections. 

For  all  these  widespread  shortcomings,  though,  the 
political  process  is  looking  very  encouraging  in  a  number 
of cities and countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, 
as  it  is  beginning  to  usher  in  a  more  positive  political  and 
institutional  environment.  For  instance,  municipal  officials 
and  politicians  have  gained  a  deeper  understanding  of 
the  conditions  in  informal  neighbourhoods  and  are  more 
committed to improve these, as illustrated by regional trends 
showing that more than 32 million people in the region are 
no longer considered “slum dwellers” (see Chapter 1.3). 

Positive  change  is  also  making  itself  felt  in  areas  like 
institutional strengthening, participatory budgeting and other 
participation  procedures,  along  with  greater  efficiency  in 
public capital investment, sounder administrative procedures 
and  enhanced  accountability.  New  forums  for  cross-sector 
coordination between social-oriented organizations and local 
and national governments have been created in many cities. 
Concerns  for  civic  and  human  rights  are  more  and  more 
apparent in urban life. As an expert in São Paulo remarked, 
“social  movements  and  organizations  that  support  and 
guarantee the enforceability of rights consider that talk about 
“rights” effectively refers to the right to the city”.31 

Together with these more positive developments, municipal 
management and political participation in Latin America and 
the Caribbean have some instances of best practice to offer. 
In Curitiba, novel forms of civic participation are developed 
through  the  Ruas  da  Cidadania  (“streets  of  citizenship”) 
scheme. In these areas, residents contribute their views and 
practical  ideas  in  a  collective  effort  to  improve  access  to 
municipal public services. In Oruro, a new “Dialogue Law” 
supports  the  political  participation  and  inclusion  of  all 
citizens. In Port-au-Prince, the water supply and sanitation 
sector has been reformed by law, and network management 
has  become  participatory  through  so-called  “Local  Water 
Committees”.  In  Quito,  city  authorities  have  established 
an autonomous commission (known as “Quito Honesto”) to 
fight  corruption  in  municipalities.  In  Portoviejo,  integral 
management of risks in slum settlements is a major project. 
In São Paulo as in other Brazilian and, more generally, Latin 
American cities, participatory democracy and budgeting are 
becoming  integral  to  municipal  management.  If  anything, 
these  instances  of  best  practice  demonstrate  the  close  links 
among political inclusiveness, democratic governance and the 
full exercise of civic and political rights. 

Promoting cultural expression matters for 
political inclusion

The social and ethnic diversity that characterizes cities in 
both Africa and Latin America is probably behind the UN-
HABITAT survey finding that when municipalities formally 
(i.e., by law) promote cultural expression, they also contribute 
to  political  inclusion.  The  survey  has  identified  many 

municipal initiatives aimed at promoting cultural inclusion 
through specific events and facilities, including presentations, 
exhibitions and workshops in those areas where they would 
otherwise be unavailable. In this respect and as mentioned 
earlier, Bogotá has enacted its own “Declaration of Cultural 
Rights” in a bid to enhance equal opportunities for cultural 
expression by all segments of the population; this came as 
part of a broader-ranging effort to promote cultural diversity 
and more equitable appropriation of the city’s cultural riches 
and heritage.

Micro-credit promotes political inclusion through 
knowledge and networking

In Latin America and the Caribbean, the UN-HABITAT 
survey has uncovered a positive, significant if rather indirect 
association between micro-credit and political inclusion. The 
causal link, which involves human capital, works as follows: 
on top of mobilizing the productive capacities of the poor, 
micro-credit also links those involved with other economic 
agents,  disseminating  local  knowledge  through  networks  – 
and contributing to the recognition of their associations as 
social, economic and political stakeholders to interact with. 
The  Quito  municipality  supports  micro-credit  through  a 
dedicated  organization  called  AGRUPAR  (for  Agricultura 
Urbana  Participativa),  which  promotes  community  urban 
agriculture  and  other  forms  of  alternative  business,  in  the 
process  providing  a  degree  of  official  recognition  to  all  the 
beneficiaries.  The  municipality  of  São  Paulo  also  provides 
micro-credit  under 
its  own  entrepreneurship  support 
programme, on top of facilitating access to loans for the poor 
through its “Solidarity Credit Programme”.

Using culture as a tool for social, economic and 
political inclusion 

A  culturally 

inclusive  city  celebrates  diversity  while 
integration  of  groups  that  are 
promoting  the  social 
characterized  by  different  cultural  backgrounds  and 
expressions,  including  ethnicity,  language,  religion,  historic 
origins,  values  and  beliefs.  In  most  cities  of  the  developing 
world, recognition and promotion of cultural inclusiveness are 
entrenched in municipal as well as fundamental and national 
legal  frameworks.  Still,  as  UNESCO  stated  in  its  World 
Culture  Report  (2000),  “Cultural  diversity  [is]  a  descriptive 
feature of our contemporary world; [it] is a point of departure. 
Diversity fosters creativity, as demonstrated in the ability of 
human groups to adapt and transform their living conditions. 
(However,) as the developing world stands today, diversity and 
creativity are caught in the cage of inequality and injustice”.32 
Indeed, another finding of UN-HABITAT policy analysis 
is that cultural diversity and inclusiveness are challenged by 
similar factors in cities as diverse as Buenos Aires, Port-au-
Prince, Chittagong, Abuja and Mombasa. In the developing 
world, cultural facilities in slums and low-income urban areas 
can be scarce (if at all available), underused or dilapidated,

and ill-adjusted to local demand. In contrast, most cultural 
facilities are located in more affluent neighbourhoods. This is 
not surprising, since those struggling day after day to secure 
tenure on their homes, livelihoods and other basic necessities 
are not in a position to participate in events and achieve their 
cultural  potential.  Inequitable  distribution  of  amenities  is 
only  one  aspect  of  cultural  exclusion,  though;  another  has 
to do with inequitable access to technology and information, 
which further undermines the capacities of the poor to take 
advantage  of  modern-day  cultural  and  other  opportunities 
for self-development. In many of the cities reviewed in the 
UN-HABITAT survey, cultural events are restricted to those 
with  adequate  purchasing  power,  even  where  such  events 
are  subsidized  by  public  authorities.  On  the  other  hand, 
popular and alternative arts, musical and cultural events are 
often  marginalized,  or  simply  not  promoted  or  funded  by 
municipal authorities. 

Cultural inclusiveness involves a dynamic process 
of engagement

UN-HABITAT survey results suggest that in a majority of 
the cities under review, the local ethnic group languages most 
spoken by the population are not used in official dealings, 
on  signs  or  public  information  boards.  Nevertheless,  it 
must be recognized that cities enable some forms of cultural 
rights and expressions, and they do so through three main 
channels: (1) ad hoc provision of shared spaces for cultural 
events; (2) promotion of intercultural programmes; and (3) 
the  protection  and  celebration  of  specific  monuments  and 
buildings that are part of the architectural heritage. In most 
cases, though, the rationale behind such cultural expression 

and heritage preservation is to impose predetermined values 
and  single,  one-way  meanings  on  places  and  narratives 
that reflect only the history of the country’s or city’s ethnic 
majorities  and  oligarchies.  Consequently,  these  biased 
forms  of  cultural  expression  hardly  have  any  relevance  to 
the social, cultural and ethnic diversity that is a feature of 
the  contemporary  city;  various  groups  fail  to  recognize 
themselves  in  that  particular  history  or  local  identity, 
adding  to  their  sense  of  systematic  exclusion.33  The  cities 
of  Dhaka,  Chittagong  and  Rajshahi,  in  Bangladesh,  are  a 
case  in  point:  the  cultural  dominance  of  Bengali  Muslims 
(the  majority  demographic  group)  and,  to  a  lesser  extent, 
of Bengali Hindus, stands in the way of official recognition 
of  the  cultural  rights  of  minority  groups.34  In  India,  some 
cities had at some point managed to become cohesive despite 
their  diversity,  but  today  are  “facing  a  grave  challenge  to 
[the country’s] constitutional commitment to multiple and 
complementary identities with the rise of groups that seek to 
impose a singular Hindu identity on the country”.35 

Freedom of expression is strongly linked with 
cultural inclusion 

It  may  not  be  so  surprising  that  those  groups  that  find 
themselves  systematically  excluded  when 
it  comes  to 
expressing  their  cultural  identity  or  accessing  opportunities 
for cultural integration are the same in Africa, Asia or Latin 
America and the Caribbean – namely the disabled, the elderly 
and  young  people,  as  well  as,  with  some  variations,  either 
uneducated people or foreign immigrants. Somewhat more 
surprising is the fact that in all these regions, slum dwellers

appear  as  the  third  most  excluded  group.  Comments  from 
local experts are unambiguous, though: 
•	 “A person that is poor economically will very often be poor 

socially and culturally, too” (Quito).36 

•	 “Ethnic  minorities  rank,  generally  speaking, 

in  the 
same  category  as  the  common  poor  and  disempowered” 
(Dhaka).37

•	 “Cultural inclusion is linked to the economic well-being of 
a community, and since the poor are excluded economically, 
their degrees of social, political and cultural inclusion are 
low as well” (Rajshahi).38 
These  findings  make  it  easier  to  understand  why  survey 
respondents, here again, perceived freedom of expression as 
strongly linked to the promotion of cultural inclusiveness, 
not  just  in  Asia  but  in  the  African  cities  under  review  as 
well. These results call attention to a very important issue: in 
both Asian and African cities, poverty is the most significant 
impediment to cultural participation, which only very few 
institutions are in a position to promote. In contrast, in the 
Latin American and Caribbean cities under review, cultural 
inclusiveness is positively correlated with laws that promote 
equitable  employment,  as  well  as  with  fiscal  incentives, 
micro-credit  and  formal  municipal  promotion  of  cultural 
inclusion.

Historically entrenched inequalities in regions affect 
cultural inclusion in cities

The Asian and, to a lesser extent, Latin American cities in 
the survey are located in countries with predominant cultures 
where minorities remain marginalized. This is why, in Asian 
cities,  freedom  of  expression  and  promotion  of  cultural 
expression at the municipal level are strongly associated with 
cultural  inclusiveness.  This  situation  points  to  historically 
entrenched  inequalities  in  the  region  and  their  persistence 
across generations. However, in Latin America dominance by 
a majority culture is mitigated by two types of factors: some 
are  of  a  general  kind,  namely,  economic  incentives,  which 
represent serious attempts to even out access to culture; other 
factors  are  more  specific  to  the  region,  such  as  the  greater 
emphasis  on  participatory  approaches  that  characterizes  the 
Latin American cities in the survey.

Those cities and countries that manage to mitigate cultural 
exclusion clearly demonstrate the need for multi-dimensional 
responses.  These  combine  effective  access  to  education, 
the  judiciary  and  other  public  and  private  services,  such  as 
culture,  sports  and  leisure  activities  and  amenities.39  Cities 
should also encourage anything that can foster multiple and 
complementary identities in order to reduce any polarization 
between  groups,  particularly  in  a  multi-cultural,  multi-
linguistic,  multi-ethnic  type  of  society.40  Recognition  of 
cultural  diversity  entails  the  deployment  of  spaces  and

conditions  that  favour  various  forms  of  active  participation,  in 
accordance with the various societal, cultural and organizational 
forms that characterize any specific population.

It  is  becoming  more  and  more  accepted  that  recognition  of 
cultural  diversity  is  essential  to  the  construction  of  citizenship, 
which in turn facilitates the transformation of customs, attitudes 
and  practices  for  the  purposes  of  an  enhanced  democratic 
culture. This broad-ranging effort is placed under the overarching 
principles of respect for the rights of others, including the right 
to be different, and the rights to solidarity and social inclusion, 
among others. In many cases, best practice seems to derive from 
close collaboration between national and local authorities, as most 
surveyed experts recognized. In Oruro, for instance, the new State 
Constitution (2009) recognizes the political rights of all segments 
of  the  Bolivian  population,  including  the  right  of  indigenous 
peoples  to  their  own  autonomy,  customs  and  traditions  in  the 
political,  economic,  social  and  cultural  spheres.  In  other  cases, 
initiatives enabling cultural rights and expression are launched by 
municipalities  themselves.  In  Bogotá,  for  instance,  in  the  mid-
1990s, mayor Antanas Mockus positioned culture as a cornerstone 
in the construction of citizenship. As mentioned earlier, Bogotá’s 
own  declaration  of  cultural  rights  promotes  cultural  freedom, 
pluralistic  values  and  autonomy  of  individuals  regardless  of 
cultural, social or ethnic background. In Johannesburg, cultural 
inclusiveness is enshrined in the 1996 Bill of Rights, which, as 
also mentioned earlier, formally grants residents the right to use 
their language and to participate in the cultural life of their choice. 
In eThekwini, under the 2008/09 Integrated Development Plan, 
the  municipality  recognizes  and  supports  cultural  diversity, 
providing the opportunities (in the areas of sports and recreation, 
arts,  culture  and  heritage)  the  population  needs  for  individual 
development, community solidarity and economic advantage.  

Other cities also take tangible steps to promote cultural equity 
beyond  formal  declarations.  In  Curitiba,  municipal  policies 
enhance  the  roles  of  urban  planning  and  the  environment, 
providing green areas, parks and forests that link the functions 
of  environmental  protection,  sanitation,  sports,  leisure,  social 
and cultural life. São Paulo has opened more than 40 “Unified 
Education Centres” providing much-needed venues for cultural 
activities  in  otherwise  deprived  areas.  In  Quito,  best  practice 
includes the defense of public spaces and recovery of areas and 
buildings of cultural significance, and for the enjoyment of the 
whole population.

The Five Steps to an 
Inclusive City
Making rights effective

An  inclusive  city  can  be  defined  and  personally 

experienced  in  many  different  ways  by  its 
residents.  Still,  as  suggested  in  this  Report, 
inclusive cities share a number of basic features 
that take different shapes in various conditions. Any inclusive 
city provides the opportunities and supportive mechanisms 
that enable all residents to develop their full potential and gain 
their  fair  shares  of  the  “urban  advantage”.1  As  suggested  in 
Part 2, this “advantage”  includes access to all aspects of basic, 
decent  living  conditions  such  as  housing,  transportation, 
education,  recreation,  communication,  culture,  religion,  
employment and the judiciary, among others. These benefits 
also extend to the less tangible aspects of urban or community 
life, such as experiencing a sense of belonging, identity and 
place.  In  an  inclusive  city,  residents  perceive  themselves  as 
important  contributors  to  decision-making,  ranging  from 
political issues to the more mundane routines of daily lives. 
Active  participation  guarantees  all  residents  a  stake  in  the 
benefits  of  urban  development.  The  concepts  of  human 
relations, citizenship and civic rights are all inseparable from 
urban inclusiveness.

Rights: From paper to reality

The  local  experts  who  participated  in  the  2009  UN-
HABITAT  Policy  Analysis  on  the  Inclusive  City  concurred 
that if municipal authorities are to foster inclusiveness in their 
cities, they must look beyond constitutional or national laws 
and the associated perfunctory lists of recognized rights and 
duties. Municipal authorities must also lay down the specific 
conditions that will make all declared rights effective. As an 
expert in Quito made quite clear, “Las ciudades deben pasar del 
papel a la realidad” (cities must move from paper to reality).2 
This said, however, the policy analysis also reveals a substantial 
degree of confusion with regard not only to the meaning and 
scope of declared rights, but also to the way these rights are to 
become effective on a day-to-day basis. 

Quick Facts 

1.  The benefits of an inclusive city extend to the 
less tangible aspects of urban and community 
life, such as sense of belonging, identity and 
place. The concepts of human relationships, 
citizenship and civic rights are all inseparable 
from urban inclusiveness. 

2.  The rights recognized in constitutional or 

national laws remain largely notional, and it is 
for municipal authorities to make them effective 
with central and local government support. 
This is especially the case with cultural and 
political rights. 

3.  Institutions are now seen at the centre of 

efforts to promote sustainable development 
and reduce poverty and inequality. For the 
moment, existing rules and institutions are 
too often perceived as favouring the rich and 
powerful. 

4.  Information technologies can turn the 

relationship between municipal authorities 
and the community from a one-way into a two-
way process, streamlining procedures and 
enhancing transparency.

As  noted  in  Chapter  3.2,  the  process  of  turning  rights 
into  tangible  improvements  in  economic,  social,  political, 
and cultural inclusion begins with the recognition that the 
four  dimensions  of  inclusion  are  inter-related.  Municipal 
authorities make significant progress in bridging the urban 
divide when they integrate all dimensions of inclusion into 
policies.  This  is  especially  so  where  cities  enhance  each 
dimension of inclusion simultaneously, granting each equal 
priority  in  city  governance,  planning,  management  and 
implementation. Still, how can cities make multi-dimensional 
inclusion a tangible reality? What are the elements of success? 
What  are  the  steps  and  catalysts  that  can  bring  or  trigger 
change?

Based on UN-HABITAT survey returns, this final chapter 
lays down a series of practical steps and catalytic levers which 
municipal  authorities  can  make  and  activate  to  bridge  the 
urban divide. 

Five steps to an inclusive city

UN-HABITAT policy analysis identifies five major steps to 

an inclusive city: 
1. assessing the past and measuring progress;
2. establishing new, more effective institutions, or strengthen-

ing existing ones as needed; 

3. building new linkages and alliances across tiers of govern-

ment; 

inclusiveness; and 

4. developing a sustained, comprehensive vision to promote 

5. ensuring an equitable redistribution of opportunities. 

Some  additional  factors  may  be  needed,  the  specific 
nature of which will vary from one city to the other. In this 
endeavour, and given the many dimensions of inclusiveness, 
effective coordination of municipal authorities with local and 
central government has a pivotal role to play. 

Assessing the past and 
measuring progress 

The beauty and the challenge of urban space is that no two 
cities are alike. Each has its own history, economy, politics, 
social dynamics, cultural style and, above all, human potential. 
Understanding how these have come together over time in a 
particular city is a crucial step for any municipal authority 
committed  to  promoting  inclusion.  This  comprehensive 
assessment  will  determine  what  the  next  four  steps  must 
involve, and what they require from the various stakeholders, 
with  regard  to  institutional  strengthening,  coordination 
between various tiers of government, building and projecting 
a vision, and distribution of opportunities. This assessment 
will also provide the benchmark against which policies and 
practices can be measured, enabling municipal authorities to 
monitor progress and evaluate performance. 

Policy Points 

1.  The way municipalities perform their duties 
is just as important as the nature of what they 
achieve.

2.  It takes four steps to close the urban divide: 

new or strengthened, more effective 
institutions; new linkages and alliances 
across the three tiers of government; a 
sustained, comprehensive vision to promote 
inclusiveness; and ensuring an equitable 
redistribution of opportunities.

3.  A city “vision” is not a fiction. It is based 

on a realistic assessment of current assets 
and comparative advantage, building on 
this potential to take advantage of future 
opportunities to fulfill the aspirations of a whole 
community.

4.  It takes five levers to integrate the poor 

and marginalized into mainstream urban 
life: improved quality of life, investment in 
human capital formation, sustained economic 
opportunities, enhanced political inclusion, and 
cultural inclusion.

5.  Cash transfers linked to health- or education-

related conditions are increasingly found to be 
the best way of enhancing both incomes in the 
short run and capabilities in the longer term.

Confronting the past is a difficult but necessary exercise. 
As  stressed  throughout  this  Report,  exclusion  builds  and 
perpetuates over time. Cities do not divide overnight. They are 
the product of contested development over generations, often 
fierce competition for land, labour and capital, for political 
representation and identity, and for basic human dignity. In 
Brazil, for instance, the end of military dictatorship in 1988 
gave way to democratic practices both at national and local 
scales. The “right to the city” became a municipal expression 
of the broader opening at the national level (see Chapter 3.1). 
But then it would take many years, and a succession of leaders 
both national and municipal, just to begin to address the root 
causes of exclusion, and a decade to align policy and public 
capital investment with constitutional prerogative. 

If the direction of change is to be realistically determined, and 
the political, social, institutional and financial requirements 
of  reform  to  be  accurately  anticipated,  understanding 
the  evolution  of  a  city  is  an  essential  prerequisite.  Equally 
crucial  is  the  process  through  which  such  an  assessment  is 
undertaken.  Just  like  its  intended  outcome,  a  situation 
analysis of a city should be inclusive, i.e., involve municipal 
authorities, the business, utility and financial sectors, social 
movements,  micro-finance  institutions,  private  developers, 
investors and any relevant central government departments. 
The various local stakeholders each bring with them a distinct 
perspective and set of interests. As they help assess where the 
city has come from, they will also feel more committed to its 
future pathway. 

A desired by-product of inclusive analysis is a monitoring 
framework  with  well-determined  baseline  conditions. 
In  addition  to  demographic  and  health  indicators,  this 
framework  can  also  capture  the  current  condition  and 
potential of municipal institutions. Since bridging the urban 
divide involves complex challenges and long-term solutions, 
it is important that any performance indicators can measure 
all aspects of inclusion, both the desired outcomes and the 
processes that can lead to them.

More effective, stronger institutions

Most  of  the  experts  participating  in  the  UN-HABITAT 
urban  policy  analysis  in  the  developing  world  agreed  that 
existing  rules  and  institutions  are  creations  of  the  rich  and 
powerful, and frequently cater solely to their interests with 
little regard for those of other social groups, particularly the 
poor. However, this negative perception is not held by all of 
the  respondents;  some  have  identified  a  new  development 
paradigm  that  places  institutions  at  the  centre  of  efforts 
to  promote  sustainable  development  and  reduce  poverty 
and  inequality  –  in  the  process  recognizing  the  specific 
moral  leverage  of  institutions  and  their  power  of  social 
transformation. 

Today, evidence from successful cities shows that the way 
municipalities  perform  their  duties  is  just  as  important  as 
the nature of what they achieve.3 Inclusive cities conduct in-
depth  reviews  of  their  systems,  structures  and  institutional

the  performance  of 
mechanisms;  beyond  enhancing 
development-related institutions, these cities look to improve 
methods  and  procedures  to  pave  the  way  for  genuine 
institutional  change.  The  UN-HABITAT  policy  analysis 
identified  many  best  practices  with  regard  to  municipal 
evaluation and adaptation. Almost all the cities surveyed are 
governed by some form of municipal statute and administrative 
bodies in charge of enforcement; but some perform better than 
others when it comes to evaluating and amending municipal 
mandates and enlarging the scope of governance to pressing 
issues of social, political and cultural inclusiveness. São Paulo, 
for instance, revised its municipal charter in 2003 to place 
“inclusive”  issues  like  health,  education,  the  environment, 
food security, the needs of elderly people and social welfare, 
among  others,  at  the  top  of  its  agenda.4  Establishing  new 
institutions  and  strengthening  existing  ones  is,  in  itself,  a 
societal  transformation  process  that  requires  national  and 
local  ownership.  In  this  respect,  Johannesburg  provides  a 
particularly  good  instance  of  proper  coordination  between 
central and municipal government: local implementation of 
the 1996 national “Growth, Employment and Redistribution 
Policy” required a restructuring of public sector institutions 
in the city and deployment of new policy frameworks for the 
delivery of social services, in order to match the mandates set 
out by central government.

In any city, institutional change requires periodic reviews 
of  and  amendments  to  municipal  mandates,  together  with 
critical monitoring of institutional effectiveness to make sure 
policies keep adjusting to urban change. Previous research by 
the Asian Development Bank identified Quezon City in the 
Philippines as an apt example of a new urban development 
strategy, complete with a well-adjusted legal framework that 
has  the  potential  to  facilitate  locally  owned  organizational 
change.5 Similarly, the government of West Bengal in India 
has established a “Change Management Unit” to supervise the 
implementation of programmes that reduce poverty, enhance 
quality of life and improve access to basic services in Kolkata 
–  a  recognized  best  practice.  This  innovation  is  one  of  the 
Kolkata municipality’s systemic efforts to deploy innovative 
strategies and structures for the sake of better accountability 
of local resource management.6

Nobel  economics  laureate  Joseph  Stiglitz  has  established 
that  if  socioeconomic  development  is  to  happen,  it  must 
involve an active role for government. This in turn requires 
strong  institutions  that  guarantee  systems  efficiency,  along 
with  the  procedures  needed  to  evolve  consensus  around 
societal values and the new codes of conduct that enable any 
society to function well.7 In Rwanda, for instance, the Imihigo 
(“challenging oneself”) programme focuses on performance 
management  of  local  authorities  across  the  country,  in  the 
process enabling communities and local leaders to develop a 
culture of cooperation in pursuit of common goals.8 

Laws  and  policies  require  enforcement 

institutions. 
However,  the  UN-HABITAT  policy  analysis  shows  that  a 
number of cities fail to establish such institutions (owing to 
limited  institutional  or  organizational  capacities,  or  lack  of 

interest  or  focus),  and  as  a  result  laws  and  policies  do  not 
achieve intended goals. For example, cultural prejudice and 
social bias are major factors behind exclusive access to the social 
venues and other amenities enjoyed by certain social groups, 
although national constitutions and other legal instruments 
may guarantee freedom of access. Fewer than 25 per cent of 
all respondents to the UN-HABITAT survey felt their city’s 
institutional and organizational capacities were apt to address 
pervasive prejudice and bias; as far as urban populations are 
concerned, this situation can only cause disillusionment with 
the capacity of the system to respond to their needs, especially 
among marginalized and vulnerable groups. 

New institutions or new channels

Those  cities  and  countries  that  have  effectively  brought 
about institutional change and reforms have resorted to two 
main types of strategies. The more widespread one involves 
the creation of dedicated agencies to oversee public efforts to 
advance the rights and interests of the public (whether those 
of the citizenry at large or of specific, excluded groups). An 
alternative  strategy  has  municipal  authorities  establish  new 
institutional channels and allocate resources to specific issues 
within existing institutions. The first strategic option entails 
the creation of new organizations (ministries or departments) 
with  new  sets  of  rules,  such  as  dedicated  mechanisms  for 
women’s  inclusion  and  empowerment.  Brazil  provides  the 
most prominent example of a new ministry created (in 2003) 
to take care of racial issues related to the country’s majority 
Afro-descendant  population.9  The  second  strategic  option 
(i.e.,  new,  dedicated  institutional  channels  within  existing 
public bodies) has seen the government of Australia improve 
social  inclusion  through  reinforced  coordination  of  public 
institutions,  in  a  bid  more  directly  to  address  the  needs  of 
jobless families and children at risk in deeply underprivileged 
communities.  Since  inception  in  2007,  this  initiative  has 
mainstreamed the social inclusion agenda into the work of all 
relevant government departments.10

Effective  institutional  change  also  requires  appropriate 
indicators  and  metrics  of  evaluation.  These  can  play  two 
complementary roles: acting as “engines of learning”, and as 
permanent  mechanisms  whereby  institutions,  programmes 
and  systems  are  revised,  improved  and  adapted.  In  South 
Africa,  for  instance,  the  municipality  of  Tshwane  (which 
includes  Pretoria)  has  set  up  a  monitoring  and  evaluation 
unit; on top of reviewing and amending the city’s “vision” and 
monitoring overall progress towards targets and benchmarks, 
the unit promotes stakeholder engagement and transparency. 
The  unit  assesses  structures,  processes  and  outcomes  of 
existing and newly created institutions against clearly defined 
indicators. These combine with knowledge systems that keep 
a record of the process and facilitate the sharing of experiences 
and practices.11 

In other cases, information technologies have done more 
than improve data processing: they have provided advanced 
decision support systems that strengthen institutions. In São

Paulo, for instance, the social housing department in 2005 
deployed  a  dedicated  information  system  which,  on  top  of 
providing information on the main housing indicators, also 
operates  as  a  set  of  rules  that  automatically  signal  which 
aspects of each programme call for priority attention at any 
one time. This set-up facilitates both institutional efficiency 
and acceptance of resource deployment rules by the relevant 
communities.12 

Building new relations and alliances 
across tiers of government

Today in many countries, decentralization gives sub-national 
authorities ample autonomous powers for policymaking and 
public spending, at least notionally. In practice, however, it 
appears that lower tiers of government remain well short of 
the human and financial resources they need, especially when 
it comes to reducing structural forms of inequality. In other 
countries, local authorities lack the institutional autonomy, 
the  resources  and  the  mandates  to  address  any  of  the  four 
dimensions  of  inequality.  Consequently,  in  both  groups 
of  countries,  municipal  authorities  often  depend  on  the 
policies, programmes and fiscal/budget initiatives of central 
governments.

Routine links for results

Some cities have managed to mobilize capacities to develop 
innovative  programmes  and  actions,  deploying  both  greater 
“entrepreneurship”  and  more  resources  to  maximize  com-
parative advantage and geographic endowment. It cannot be 
stressed too strongly, though, that even such dynamic munici-
palities can achieve little if they fail to develop strategic alliances 
that combine policies and resources with other tiers of govern-
ment as well as the private and public sectors. The crux of their 
success  is  their  understanding  that  local  innovation  mostly 
relies on national institutions and central budget allocations, 
particularly  in  the  implementation  phase.  Efficient  linkages 
among different tiers of government and civil society also en-
sure greater sustainability of local programmes, as findings of 
the UN-HABITAT Policy Analysis on the Inclusive City sug-
gest. The analysis identifies several innovative instances where 
institutional inter-linkages routinely reduce urban inequalities. 
In Cartago, Costa Rica, for example, public-private collabora-
tion in the issuance of so-called “municipal bonds” has raised 
much-needed  resources  for  local  development.  Under  this 
scheme, mortgage banks sell bonds to the central government 
(instead of individual or institutional investors) and transfer 
the proceeds to municipal authorities in support of local infra-
structure improvements.13 Ghana’s capital, Accra, provides an-
other noteworthy example. Thanks to financial backing from 
central government and in a bid to promote education and 
social inclusiveness, the municipality has abolished all forms of 
levies and school fees in government-run schools. These have 
been replaced by a capitation grant which, combined with free 
school buses, has led to an increase in enrolments.14

The UN-HABITAT policy analysis identifies many other 
instances where this type of coordination has narrowed the 
urban divide, including in Peru and Argentina. The fact that 
Latin  America  stands  out  in  this  respect  is  not  surprising: 
the  region  concentrates  an  overwhelming  majority  of  the 
programmes that involve cooperation among the three tiers 
of government. In contrast, the Asian cities under review are 
characterized by a predominance of national (as opposed to 
municipal) planning strategies and programmes, including for 
promotion of social, economic and political equality. In Asia, 
the intermediate (state/provincial) tier of government enjoys 
some degree of autonomy, but the policy analysis found that 
when  it  came  to  implementation,  the  involvement  of,  and 
coordination  with  local  authorities  were  relatively  weak.  In 
the African cities under review, and apart from Johannesburg 
and  Accra,  lack  of  coordination  among  the  three  tiers  of 
government seems to be one of the major determinants of the 
high degrees of inequality highlighted in Chapter 2.2. 

The  experts  participating  in  the  UN-HABITAT  policy 
analysis  concluded  that  it  took  no  less  than  the  three  tiers 
of government to make a city inclusive, and even a fourth 
one – metropolitan-area coordinating bodies – depending on 
local  circumstances.  In  the  developing  world,  reality  is  all-
too often at odds with this recommendation, as government 
coordination remains patchy, poor and informal. Persistent 
inability by various bodies at the three echelons of govern-
ment to develop collaborative arrangements can only restrict 
their  capacity  to  act  together  in  one  and  the  same  urban 
space. In other words, poor coordination generally tends to 
reinforce under-development and exclusion. It is incumbent, 
therefore, on municipal authorities to display the “entrepre-
neurship” (i.e., a combination of initiative and dynamism) 
that will earn them the recognition they need from the in-
termediate and central tiers of government. Such recognition 
will result in a greater degree of involvement in regional and 
national development strategies, paving the way for the day-
to-day coordination that will put municipal authorities in a 
position to tackle the urban divide in a more effective and 
sustainable way. 

Bridging the political gaps: Share and collaborate

Experience shows that at the root of successful collaboration 
lies an institutional and managerial capacity to share resources 
such as staff, skills, funding, information and knowledge for 
mutual benefit. This capacity, in turn, derives from constant 
dialogue and interactions among public authorities. This is 
particularly the case in democratic societies, exposed as they 
are to the endless succession of breakdowns, negotiations and 
alliances  that  characterize  day-to-day  relationships  among 
the three tiers of government, and against a background of 
political  differences  and  shifts  in  ruling  parties,  ideologies 
and  policies.  Bogotá  provides  an  apt  example  of  effective 
collaboration that has not allowed the political ebb and flow 
to  interfere  with  major  innovations  of  an  inclusive  nature. 

The  city’s  innovative  programmes  and  policies  involve 
a  universal,  comprehensive  health  care  programme  that 
includes schemes known as “Health at home” and “Health at 
school” and is funded by the central government budget. The 
programmes achieve universal health care provision through 
due  regard  for  local  conditions.  “Bogotá  without  Hunger” 
is another initiative that meshes the local with the national, 
providing  food  to  local  children  free  of  charge  thanks  to 
central government funding.15 

Another  lesson  from  successful  cities  is  that  inequalities 
emphasize  the  need  for  interventions  that  are  sensitive  to 
local  requirements  and  circumstances.  Central  government 
policies  must  fully  take  these  particular  conditions  into 
account,  while  at  the  same  time  proposing  solutions 
that  are  replicable  and  can  be  scaled  up  nationwide.  In  a 
number  of  cases,  two-way  collaboration  between  local  and 
central  authorities  has  resulted  in  a  gradual  expansion  of 
functions  and  capacities  that  were  traditionally  assigned  to 
local  governments  (basic  infrastructure,  urban  transport, 
management of public spaces) to include more complex areas 
(resource management, environmental protection, promotion 
of competitiveness, capital investment, financing and other 
productive  functions).  In  some  cases,  municipalities  have 
also gained control over provision and regulation of health 
services, housing and education. Admittedly, these changes 
are occurring with variable intensities in a number of cities 
across the developing world.16 

Adjusting national mandates

As part of the two-way local-national coordination process, 
central  governments  are  also  adjusting  their  own  mandates 
and  responsibilities  –  developing  macro-economic  and 
industrial  policies, 
implementing  nation-wide  reforms, 
deciding  on  regional  choices  and  allocations  of  resources, 
mobilizing  public  and  private  investments,  and  supervising 
and  monitoring  the 
implementation  of  a  variety  of 
decisions.  These  new  configurations  provide  opportunities 
to  develop  various  forms  of  coordination  and  synergies, 
testing new methods or solutions on an ongoing basis. This 
is where free political expression and freedom of association 
and  participation  have  essential  roles  to  play,  ensuring 
accountability  and  transparency  as  improved  coordination 
among  public  authorities  results  in  enhanced  effectiveness 
on the ground. Accountability also encourages collaboration 
over rights-based policies with institutions and stakeholders 
at  national  and  intermediate  levels;  it  also  helps  mobilize 
resources  and  support.  Two  avenues  are  available  here: 
accountability can be secured either through institutionalized 
channels, or through social participatory movements. A good 
example of the latter is the Forum Centro Vivo in São Paulo, 
which acts as a relay for residents’ demands for the right to 
live in the centre of the city, as part of a broader campaign for 
democracy and inclusiveness and against exclusionary types 
of urban renewal.

Demonstrating a sustained vision to 
promote inclusiveness 

Cities need a clear “vision” of their future – a long-term plan 
that combines creativity, realism and inspiration and provides 
a  framework  for  strategic  planning.  The  building  of  a  city’s 
future starts today, and this can only be a future to be shared 
between present and future generations. This is why municipal 
authorities must address the major factors behind the current 
urban  divide  –  social  inequalities,  poverty  and  exclusion. 
Municipal authorities must also take into account those factors 
on which communities build present and future opportunities, 
including  competitiveness,  economic  development,  good 
governance and sustainability.17 

A city’s “vision” builds upon its specific identity, comparative 
advantage  and  geographic  endowments  as  well  as  defining 
historical and cultural dimensions. It is not just a city’s function, 
structure and form that its vision projects into the future, but 
also a community’s dreams and aspirations.18 For this reason, 
any city “vision” should always be context-driven and developed 
with the participation of all segments of the population. 

Too many cities in the developing world, however, lack both 
vision  and  long-term  urban  development  plans.  Outdated 
master  plans  are  increasingly  at  odds  with  today’s  realities. 
Some cities have developed new plans deriving from unrealistic 
visions. Many others have no shortage of good plans or ideas, 
but  lack  the  well-defined  roadmaps  and  adequate  resources 
required for implementation; this leaves them in a quandary 
with regard to costs and funding. 

The  practical  import  of  these  various  shortcomings  is  the 
same: today, in a majority of cities, urban planning practice 
seems  to  be  divorced  from  any  long-term  city  vision.  Many 
urban dwellers wonder who is in charge of planning nowadays: 
the  public,  developers,  or  politicians.  This  comes  with  a 
perception that many major decisions are not guided by any 
long-term community plan (see Box 3.3.1), but rather by here-
and-now  pressures  from  individual  stakeholders19;  this  holds 
even where urban plans have been devised and the municipality 
is  supposed  to 
implement  them  through  participatory 
mechanisms. There is a general sentiment that implementation 
rests not on resident participation, but rather on some vested 
interests,  preventing  expected  benefits  from  trickling  down 
to  poor  communities.20  Dhaka’s  newly  developed  “Detailed 
Area  Plan”  is  a  case  in  point:  this  highly  exclusive  scheme 
allocates 34 per cent of available space to 4.4 million middle- 
and upper-income people in outer Dhaka, and only 0.3 per 
cent of space to 4.5 million low-income residents.21 In other 
cities, though, the “vision” involves adequate plans for social 
inclusion.  This  is  the  case  with  the  Abuja  Master  Plan  (see 
Chapter 3.1), which has the potential to promote inclusiveness 
and reduce inequalities – if properly implemented. However, 
as one expert in Nigeria’s capital remarked, “It is the process of 
implementing the dream of Abuja that is not inclusive socially, 
politically or economically, not the plan itself”.22 This resonates 
with experts in other locations, such as Jaipur: “It is not the 
Master Plan that is flawed, but the implementation”.23 

Evolving a vision, together

The  remarks  of  respondents  to  the  survey  component  of 
UN-HABITAT’s policy analysis and the experiences of others 
suggest that it is not enough for a city’s vision to reflect the 
shared aspirations of its whole population. Implementation 
should also take on a collective dimension, since any progress 
towards a more inclusive city is a collective endeavour. This 
entails collaboration among all tiers of government and civil 
society (business, trade unions, community groups and the 
citizenry), which should prevent some interest groups from 
dominating  the  whole  process  and  dictating  “what  is  best 
for the city”. As noted in Chapter 3.2, the problem is that 
(according to nearly half of survey respondents) residents are 
not really interested in participating in the political process 
that  shapes  a  city’s  future;  this  comes  as  a  direct  reflection 
of their dissatisfaction with current participatory approaches, 
which they perceive as biased or ineffective. 

Considering the high degrees of complexity and abstraction 
involved in the development of a vision for a city, it is advisable 
to  start  with  a  preliminary  general  plan  on  which  other 
stakeholders can build. As Stiglitz remarks, “A development 
strategy  is  a  living  document.  It  needs  to  set  forth  how 
it  is  to  be  created,  revised,  and  adopted;  the  process  of 
participation; the means by which ownership and consensus 
is to be obtained; how the details will be fleshed out. Such a 
development strategy would fulfill several functions as it sets 
forth its vision for the future”.24 

An open, transparent process that integrates various kinds 
of  urban  stakeholders  is  in  a  better  position  to  address 
entrenched problems of exclusion and to propose solutions 
that  are  appropriate  both  culturally  and  politically.  Such 
inclusive  development  of  a  vision  and  planning  in  turn 
enhances  the  potential  for  collective  ownership,  as  the 
proposed action plan is endorsed by everyone. This two-way, 
locally  driven  and  collective  process  has  the  further  benefit 
of opening up viable alternatives which, here again, offer a 
more widely accepted course of action. This is why adequate 
conditions must be provided and enough time allocated to 
revise and change initiatives, or redirect them, depending on 
proper assessments of both the process and the results. For 
example, and as mentioned in Chapter 3.2, the Johannesburg 
municipality uses a survey to monitor satisfaction with ward 
committees  and  other  municipal  bodies  among  households 
and businesses.25 

A city’s vision must be optimistic and ambitious, and at the 
same time realistic. It should be laid out in concise format for 
ease of communication. Above all, a city’s vision of its own 
future must be comprehensive and inclusive in both statement 
and purpose. For instance, the Dakar Master Plan 2025 (Plan 
Directeur  d’Urbanisme  de  Dakar  à  l’horizon  2025)  “aims  to 
stop the anarchic occupation of the urban space, to address 
the urban transport problem and to tackle the challenge of 
slums”.26 Likewise, in Callao, Peru, the Plan de Ordenamiento 
Territorial proposes to reduce social and spatial polarization 
with proper land management over the next 15 years.27

Any vision should be innovative if it is to break with the 
inertia of the past and bring about a qualitative leap towards 
the future.28 The rationale behind Melbourne’s “Plan 2001” 
was  to  transform  the  city  into  “one  of  the  commercial, 
industrial, intellectual, and cultural capitals of the world, 
while  retaining  a  global  leadership  as  a  livable  city”.  A 
vision should also be attractive and focused. With its “Plan 
1995”, Rio de Janeiro aimed “to become a metropolis with 
increasing quality of life, socially integrated, respectful of 
public  life,  and  confirming  its  vocation  for  culture  and 
joie de vivre”.29 The Colombo “Corporate Plan” envisions 
the  Sri  Lankan  capital  as  “a  model  city  in  Asia,  a  caring 
organization looking after the interests of citizens and users 
with an efficient, quality service for creation of safe, healthy 
and wealthy living conditions”.30 

A vision, not a fiction

For all its innovative features and focus on the longer term, 
any “vision” must be realistic and feasible. Short of detailing 
how it is to deliver on clear goals, a vision will sound like 
little else but a catchphrase. Nairobi Metropolitan’s “Vision 
2030”, for example, “is to be a world-class metropolis, first 
and foremost in Africa ... for which it will create a sustainable 
world-class living and working environment”.31 Any “vision” 
must  be  accountable,  and  therefore  come  complete  with 
(a)  deliverable  milestones,  (b)  mechanisms  for  review, 
monitoring and civil society feedback, and (c) capacity for 
revision and amendment based on built-up experience. 

A vision is not only a broad statement. It must give a 
clear  sense  of  direction:  where  the  city  is  heading,  and 
the key steps that will take it in that direction, including 
the  first,  second  and  last  ones.  In  this  sense,  far  from 
being  a  fiction,  a  “vision”  is  a  plan,  a  roadmap,  and  a 
commitment  that  is  made  by  city  authorities  (who  are 
the leaders, custodians and promoters of the vision) and 
the  other  tiers  of  government  and  civil  society  (who  are 
major  stakeholders  in  the  process).  The  strength  of  the 
commitment will be a function of some of the elements 
outlined  above:  effective  coordination  with  intermediate 
and  central  tiers  of  government,  and  participatory 
formulation  of  the  “vision”  and  how  it  is  to  become  a 
reality.  For  instance,  in  South  Africa,  the  eThekwini 
Municipality’s  “Integrated  Development  Plan  2010  and 
Beyond” is based on eight distinct sub-plans, each of which 
comes complete with specific goals, strategic focus areas and 
associated programmes, major projects, budget allocations 
for  desired  outcomes,  and  performance 
indicators.32 
Indeed,  turning  a  vision  into  a  workable  plan  requires 
not  just  activities,  projects  and  monitoring  mechanisms, 
but also budgets with clearly defined funding sources. In 
Dakar,  the  above-mentioned  Plan  Directeur  d’Urbanisme 
is  now  halfway  through  implementation,  having  secured 
permanent 
from 
individual  municipalities  in  the  conurbation  and  several 
other national sector-specific projects).33

To aN iNclUSivE FUTURE

PaBlo vaggioNE, FRaNciSco PEREz aREllaNo*

As builders of bridges between present and future, urban planners are 
in	a	good	position	to	help	define	and	implement	“visions”	for	inclusive	
cities – if only they would revisit the dynamics of the profession. Com-
bining the broad perspective of the generalist and the focused expertise 
of the specialist, planners can better understand the interdependencies 
among	various	urban	functions	like	land	use	policy	and	unemployment,	
transportation and poverty, economic development and education. Pro-
active,	agile	and	plain-talking	planners	can	provide	both	leadership	and	
coordination to multi-disciplinary, participatory municipal teams. 

The  planning  function  must  reclaim  public  space  and  improve  urban 
conditions for all. Spatial planning can facilitate access to equal oppor-
tunities	for	everyone’s	development.	Planners	can	work	with	communi-
ties and civil society, assessing grassroots demands and requirements, 
jointly devising community-based projects, facilitating public participa-
tion,  mediating  in  negotiations  and  providing  technical  assistance  in 
project	 implementation.	 In	 Cato	 Manor,	 eThekwini,	 South	 Africa,	 an	
integrated,  participatory  urban  planning  process  has  evolved  a  broad 
consensus on a development model that has since enabled the commu-
nity to overcome long-standing social divides and spatial fragmentation.

With	 regard	 to	 infrastructure	 and	 services,	 planners	 can	 benchmark	
alternatives, assess scenarios and deliver neutral opinions on feasibil-
ity.	They	can	also	help	source	innovative	financial	alternatives;	in	this	
respect,  Shanghai  owes  its  success  to  its  ability  to  strengthen  insti-
tutional,	legal	and	financial	frameworks	to	attract	funding	which,	com-
bined with a proper master plan, has increased municipal revenue by a 
multiple of 14 since 1990. 

In  the  perspective  of  sustainable,  inclusive  cities  with  participatory 
decision-making,	planners’	assistance	with	master-planning	and	com-
prehensive, long-term strategies are critical for public authorities. Plan-
ners are also well-placed to help develop the policies, programmes and 
capacity-building	that	link	such	strategies	with	the	shorter	term,	as	is	
happening in Bangladesh. In Bogotá and Medellín, Colombia, the social 
integration  and  civic  transformation  at  the  core  of  municipal  policies 
involve planners along with politicians and multidisciplinary teams.

Planning also has a most natural role to play with regard to environmen-
tal	threats,	and	more	specifically	climate	change.	Holistic,	 integrated	
planning is in order both for the development of new urban areas and 
the  renewal  and  upgrading  of  the  existing  city.  In  Curitiba,  Brazil,  an 
innovative	 approach	 has	 been	 linking	 the	 upgrading	 of	 environmental	
conditions with public transport and land use planning. 

As a group of eminent planning experts recognized in the Global Report 
on Human Settlements 20091,	“Among	the	most	significant	challenges	
that urban planning has to address in the next few decades, especially 
in developing countries, are increasing poverty and inequality, as well as 
the rapidly expanding urban informal sector.” The planning profession is 
determined to meet this challenge.

In  conclusion,  a  sustained  vision  requires  a  high  dose 
of  imagination  and  creativity,  along  with  a  good  many 
arguments and counter-arguments, which together combine 
into  a  comprehensive,  final,  shared  solution,  including  the 
nuts of bolts of the implementation process and the funding 
required to turn the vision into action. Any city “vision” can 
only be rooted in common, solid ground.

ensuring the redistribution of 
opportunities 

Cities  are  places  of  opportunity.  They  act  as  engines  of 
national economies through which wealth creation, enhanced 
social  development  and  employment  can  grow.  The  urban 
environment also is the primary locus for innovation, industrial 
and technological progress, entrepreneurship and creativity.34 
Strong empirical evidence confirms that the concentration of 
people and productive activities in cities provides economies 
of scale and network effects that can dramatically reduce the 
costs of production and stimulate growth. Cities also produce 
economies of proximity, a phenomenon that involves a wide 
range  of  occupations  such  as  “crafts;  social  and  personal 
services  such  as  doctors,  teachers;  administrative  activities, 
such  as  government  and  justice;  and  finally,  consumer-
support activities, such as after-sales service and customization 
[which together] provide value-added close to the end-user”.35 
Together  with  economies  of  scale,  economies  of  proximity 
greatly reduce unit costs for collective basic services like piped 
water,  sewers  and  drains,  electricity,  solid  waste  collection, 
public transport, health care, schools and many other social 
amenities and services.36 

Springboard, or quagmire?

As  a  concentration  of  people  and  productive  activities,  a 
city can become a problem if it is inadequately planned or 
poorly governed, or when distributional policies are lacking 
or  dysfunctional.  The  distribution  of  opportunities  across 
the population can become skewed or inequitable, with large 
numbers hardly able to meet their basic needs, not to mention 
reaping the benefits of the “urban advantage”. A springboard 
for the few, the city can become a quagmire for the many – 
often literally.

Many cities face the intense social and economic problems 
that  come  with  divided  societies:  partitioned  spaces,  social, 
inter-generational  and  cultural  divides,  and  poor  political 
integration,  among  others.  On  top  of  this  by  now  all-too-
familiar  predicament,  many  cities  also  face  emerging  risks 
in  connection  with  climate  change,  diseases  on  pandemic 
scales  and  shortages  of  food  and  water.  And  they  do  so  as 
they already find themselves in no position to deliver health, 
safety and security for all. However, all these challenges are 
outnumbered by opportunities: cities will continue to stand 
at the crossroads of an interdependent world, producing the 

bulk of ideas, trade, innovation and creativity, together with 
the  necessary  institutions  and  other  forms  of  financial  and 
intellectual capital that can be used to overcome, or exacerbate, 
the urban divide.37 

Proactive  cities  can  redistribute  opportunities  in  many 
different ways. For instance, the municipality of Medellín has 
made massive investments in education in a bid to break the 
cycle of violence and narrow the urban divide. The challenge 
for  the  Colombian  city  lay  not  so  much  with  access  but 
rather the quality of schooling in the poorer barrios or slums. 
The response took the form of a variety of educational and 
nutritional programmes, especially for children under 6 years 
old.38 Some cities opt to focus on transportation, with vast 
infrastructure plans spread out over many years to improve 
connections for poor communities, in the process expanding 
social  and  economic  opportunities.  In  Johannesburg,  for 
instance,  95  per  cent  of  the  infrastructure  in  the  township 
of  Alexandra  has  been  upgraded,  on  top  of  massive  capital 
investment  in  public  transport  and  improved  housing. 
The  benefits  combine  additional  affordable  housing,  job 
creation and a more dynamic local economy through better 
connections between slums and employment opportunities in 
the wider area.39 

Creating or opening up opportunities: 
The five levers of inclusiveness

The  five  steps  recommended  above  provide  municipal 
authorities with the strategic framework they need to map out 
progress towards an inclusive city. Once they have reviewed the 
factors, including historical and cultural, that are specific to 
their city and adjusted the institutional and policy frameworks 
as required, the next step for municipal officials is to build a 
vision.  Having  laid  out  the  foundations,  policymakers  can 
undertake  over  time  to  bridge  the  urban  divide  through  a 
more equitable distribution of opportunities. 

Since this is an open-ended phase, some sort of template 
is  in  order.  UN-HABITAT  has  identified  five  levers  which 
any city must activate if it is to bridge the urban divide and 
integrate excluded or marginalized groups. The first one is of 
a general nature (granting the right to lead a decent life), but 
the  other  four  overlap  with  social,  economic,  political  and 
cultural rights and inclusion. Together, the five levers are apt 
to create fresh opportunities for the underprivileged, allowing 
them to move away from the wrong side of the urban divide 
and to turn into fully empowered citizens, responsible parents, 
professionals,  entrepreneurs,  or  otherwise  full  members  of 
society. 

The five levers of inclusiveness are as follows:

1. improve the quality of life, especially for the urban poor; 
2. invest in human capital formation; 
3. foster sustained economic opportunities; 
4. enhance political inclusion; and 
5. promote cultural inclusion.

Of  course,  cities  are  not  combating  exclusion  all  by 
themselves.  New  opportunities  in  urban  areas  come  as  the 
result of combined efforts by the three tiers of government, civil 
society (the private sector, non-governmental and community-
based organizations) and participating communities. 

As  suggested  in  the  previous  chapter,  economic,  social, 
cultural  and  political  opportunities  tend  to  reinforce  each 
other. This can only emphasize the importance of a rights-
based  approach  to  development,  and  one  that  is  holistic 
(including  the  right  to  live  a  decent  life)  with  decent 
employment and civil and political rights (including the right 
to cultural difference). 

1. Improve quality of life, especially for 
the urban poor.

If a large segment of the city’s population lacks adequate 
shelter,  water  and  sanitation,  and  lives  in  overcrowded 
conditions  without  access  to  minimum  health  care  and 
education, it is highly unlikely that this social group benefits 
from the other advantages that cities have to offer. Creating 
the conditions for improved access to safe and healthy shelter, 
basic services and social amenities such as health and education 
is essential to any individual’s physical, psychological, social 
and economic well-being.40 This is the starting point not just 
for better individual lives, but also for collective sustainable 
development,  as  the  urban  poor  come  to  make  the  best  of 
their individual and collective rights and potentials. 

Successful  urban  schemes  or  policies  integrate  various 
sector-specific components as part of holistic social policies. 
For instance, in Brazil, the federal government has increased 

the  government  has 

the  budget  for  housing  and  expanded  the  supply  side  of 
the  market  through  changes  to  home  loan  regulations. 
Concomitantly, 
increased  capital 
investment in urban infrastructure in favelas, or slum areas, 
through  the  so-called  “Growth  Acceleration  Programme” 
(Programa de Aceleração do Crescimento). More recently, the 
Brazilian  government  launched  the  “My  Home,  My  Life” 
(Minha Casa, Minha Vida) programme, providing substantial 
support to the housing sector in a bid to build one million 
homes in five years.41 This housing programme is associated 
with vigorous steps in the areas of education, cash transfers 
and  job  creation  for  the  poor.  The  rationale  behind  these 
combined efforts is to make the right to housing and the right 
to the city more effective, beyond their nominal recognition 
in  Brazil’s  Constitution  and  Statute  of  Municipalities  (see 
Chapter 3.1). 

In  South  Africa  too,  a  similar  combination  of  the 
Constitution  and  the  legislation  on  municipal  authorities 
makes  provision  of  basic  services  to  the  poor  mandatory. 
Accordingly, the Johannesburg City Council provides free-of-
charge  water  (6kl),  electricity  (50kw),  sanitation,  and  solid 
waste removal, together with an exemption of assessment rates 
on properties (valued under ZAR20,001, or US$2,650). In 
Viet Nam since 1992, Ho Chi Minh City has been deploying 
the  so-called  “Hunger  Eradication  and  Poverty  Reduction 
Fund”,  a  scheme  that  has  helped  reduce  the  proportion  of 
poor people in the city over the past 15 years. The scheme has 
funded the construction of thousands of free homes for the 
poor, as well as infrastructure in underprivileged and remote 
areas and various welfare programmes (education, health care 
and employment).42

2. Invest in human capital formation.

Current literature provides abundant evidence that human 
capital  formation  is  a  prerequisite  for  urban  development 
and a more equitable distribution of benefits.  Experts believe 
that regions and cities are the more appropriate scales for the 
interface between the formation and use of human capital. 
In this regard, cities must remain well aware that they do not 
operate  in  isolation.  Municipal  authorities  must  fully  take 
into account their various interactions with the national (e.g., 
education,  the  labour  market)  and  supranational  spheres 

(e.g., globalization and demand-driven policies). Cities and 
regions  are  well-placed  to  ensure  strategic  coordination 
between  the  institutions  and  various  stakeholders  involved 
in human capital formation, and to design policies that are 
well-adjusted to local needs. Cities can also offer improved 
communication mechanisms to strengthen the internal and 
external partnerships that are required to create and reinforce 
learning communities.43

In order to encourage human capital formation, municipal 
authorities can also deploy dedicated programmes to enhance 
the individual knowledge, skills and abilities that in turn pave 
the way for personal, social and economic well-being. Human 
capital development should not be measured only in terms 
of  skills,  outputs  and  related  economic  benefits,  though;  it 
also contributes to the non-economic aspects of development, 
such  as  character  building,  civic  awareness,  appreciation  of 
the arts and humanities, etc.44 

3. Foster sustained economic 
opportunities.45 

A  number  of  cities  develop  specific  initiatives  to  address 
systemic  failures  in  economic  inclusion,  but  some  of 
these  responses  are  not  necessarily  of  an  economic  nature. 
For  instance,  a  regulatory  framework  can  be  adjusted  to 
facilitate  the  creation  of  pro-poor  policies,  some  of  which 
can also favour overall economic growth, if only over time.46 
Participatory  decision-making  mechanisms  can  also  be 
designed to facilitate the engagement of the urban poor, since 
“they have the ability to influence those local decisions and 
policies  that  greatly  determine  the  ‘pro-poorness’  of  local 
strategic planning, priority setting and capital investments”.47 
The  2009  UN-HABITAT  survey  found  that  participatory 
planning and expression of political will, legal certainty and 
democratic institutions were perceived as key determinants of 
urban economic inclusion (see Chapter 3.2). Granting secure 
tenure (though not necessarily property titles) to the urban 
poor has also been identified as another effective long-term 
solution, since this security, an appreciating asset, provides an 
adequate base for business activities.48 

Cities  can  also  stimulate  sustained  economic  growth  for 
poor  and  underprivileged  populations  through  promotion 
of labour-intensive work methods, principally in the public 
works and construction industry, as well as support for small-
scale enterprises and the informal sector. Survey results (see 
Chapter  3.1)  showed  that  in  Latin  America,  policies  and 
schemes favouring government-induced creation of specific 
forms of employment ranked, along with micro-credit, as the 
most effective ways of reducing inequalities of income and 
opportunities. According to several studies, savings and credit 
schemes  are  more  appropriately  organized  at  community 
level, where they can benefit from the support of civil society 
organizations.49

The power of conditional cash transfers

In close cooperation with national governments, a number of 
cities in the developing world are implementing various forms 
of social security or protection schemes in a bid to expand access 
to  economic  opportunities  for  those  traditionally  excluded 
from mainstream wealth creation and economic development. 
In this respect, conditional cash transfers (CCTs) stand out 
as  the  most  efficient  poverty  reduction  mechanism.  These 

schemes  enhance  incomes  in  the  short  run  and  capabilities 
in the long term.50 They consist in direct subsidies (a small 
amount every month) to poor households that meet certain 
conditions  in  the  areas  of  health  and  education,  such  as 
enrolling children in government-run schools, getting regular 
medical check-ups and vaccinations, etc. 

Brazil runs the largest such scheme in the world, known as 
Bolsa Familia (“family stipend”), with more than 11 million 
poor  families  as  beneficiaries  (or  46  million  individuals  in 
the country’s 5,563 municipalities). As part of the “Hunger 
Zero” initiative, this scheme has contributed to a 50 per cent 
reduction in poverty between 2003 and 2008.51 In Mexico, 
the  “Oportunidades”  (“opportunities”)  scheme 
launched 
in 1997 has resulted in such a substantial reduction in the 
poverty gap that in 2009 it was introduced in urban areas. 
Cash  transfer  schemes  have  by  now  become  widespread  in 
Latin  America  and  the  Caribbean:  “Familias  en  Acción”  in 
Colombia,  “Red  de  Protección  Social”  (“social  protection 
network”,  2000)  in  Nicaragua,  and  “Bonos  de  Desarrollo 
Humano” (“human development bonds”, 2006) in Ecuador 
are the most representative in the region. Another pioneering 
experience, in Bangladesh, is the “Female Secondary School 
Assistance  Programme”  (1997),  which  aims  to  close  the 
gender gap after primary education. 

The  success  of  these  schemes  –  in  terms  of  inequality 
and poverty reduction, together with their beneficial effects 
on  schooling,  health,  infant  mortality  and  child  labour, 
among  other  issues  –  has  facilitated  replication  in  other 
parts of the world. Today, conditional cash transfer schemes 
operate  in  more  than  12  countries,  including  the  United 
States  (“Opportunity  New  York  City”),  Indonesia  (“Jaring 
Pengamanan  Sosial”,  or  safety  net  programme),  Ghana 
(“Livelihood  Empowerment  Against  Poverty”)  and  Kenya 
(“Cash  Transfers  for  Orphans  and  Vulnerable  Children”). 
Regardless  of  scope  (some  involve  only  a  few  thousand 
families), such programmes look to balance social assistance 
with  human  capital  formation.52  A  word  of  caution  is  in 
order  here,  though:  as  cash  transfer  initiatives  continue  to 
multiply  in  urban  areas,  more  rigorous  monitoring  and 
evaluation  systems  are  needed;  more  particularly,  sharper 
focus  must  be  brought  to  bear  on  the  real  beneficiaries  of 
these  schemes,  as  well  as  on  any  potential  additional  costs 
that can take the form of disincentive costs, stigma costs and 
political economy costs.53 

4. enhance political inclusion. 

Over the past few years, the concepts of political inclusion 
and  participation  have  gained  considerable  currency  in  the 
cities of many developing countries. Today, more and more 
municipal  and  national  authorities  share  the  same  basic 
philosophy: bringing government within the reach of ordinary 
people through enhanced mutual engagement. 

Regrettably,  in  many  places  these  concepts  are  no  more 
than  that  –  they  have  no  bearing  on  reality.  The  old  order 
of things – centralized, top-down, rigid methods – remains

in  decision-making  and 

the  norm,  ensconced  behind  supposedly  participatory 
mechanisms  that  are  not  only  ineffective,  but  also  lack 
political  or  institutional  legitimacy.  However,  other  cities 
resort to a variety of participatory channels and other inclusive 
tools to engage civil society, residents’ associations and local 
communities 
implementation. 
Some of these municipalities are constantly trying out new 
modes  of  political  participation,  creating  permanent  fora 
for  dialogue  and  negotiation.  Opportunities  for  extended 
participation  can  give  certain  groups  and  individuals  (the 
elderly,  the  disabled,  women,  and  those  on  low  incomes) 
effective access to the benefits of basic rights which otherwise 
could be systematically denied to them. 

Voice and improved conditions

Cities that are politically inclusive recognize that on top of 
building trust and legitimacy, continuous interaction between 
civil society and public authorities improves quality of life. 
In this sense, participation is both a consequence and a cause 
of  improved  material  conditions.  Additionally,  when  urban 
areas offer enough material resources to everyone and when 
residents  perceive  cities  as  places  of  opportunity,  effective 
participation  can  really  take  place.  Otherwise,  poverty  and 
dispossession  become  serious  barriers  to  political  inclusion, 
as  the  poor  and  marginalized  can  easily  fall  victims  to 
manipulation by their well-to-do peers and civic leaders.54

Cities can only become inclusive if all residents enjoy the 
possibility of being heard by the authorities. This does not 
require constant participation by all in all decisions; what it 
does require, instead, is a right for all to be heard and taken 
seriously  in  matters  that  concern  them.55  The  possibility 
of  being  heard  also  requires  that  channels  for  individual 
or  collective  participation  are  always  open  for  debate  over 
political or more technical issues that affect their interests and 
those of the city at large. Such local participation has become 
one of the cornerstones of modern-day democracy, and the 
only way of guaranteeing full, effective exercise of the right 
to the city. 

Cities  must  promote 

local  democracy.  Recognizing 
diversity and specific socio-spatial identities, and allowing all 
residents the political space they need to express themselves, is 
a cornerstone of any promotion of democracy and the right to 
the city. It is clear that space matters in the creation of systems 
of political representation and local participation structures.56 
The  recent  demarcation  of  wards  with  elected  councilors 
in  South  African  cities  came  as  an  attempt  to  organize 
communities and local politics as part of a democratization 
process  that  promotes  civic  rights,  and  particularly  those 
of previously marginalized groups.57 In Argentina, the civic 
forums join with local authorities and organizations to run the 
“Citizens’ Audit Programme”. Since inception in 2003, the 
scheme has established 37 active forums in 65 municipalities 
and 17 provinces. These forums give access to information, 

political  debate  and  negotiation,  including  participatory 
budgeting.58 In the Philippines, the Local Government Code 
does more than redefine the mandates, roles and responsibilities 
of  local  government;  it  also  establishes  a  clear  connection 
among provincial, city, municipal and barangay (the smallest 
political  unit)  authorities  for  the  delivery  of  basic  services 
and various other sector-specific issues (education, tourism, 
telecommunications,  housing  and  capital 
investment). 
Thanks  to  the  code,  innovative  mechanisms  have  increased 
local  financial  resources  and  made  their  management  more 
efficient and participatory.59 

Two-way communication for more accountability 
and transparency

resorting 

increasingly 

Municipal  authorities  are 

to 
information  and  communication  technologies  to  foster 
participation  and  interaction.  These  go  beyond  improved 
information  sharing,  as  they  also  transform  the  traditional 
relationships  between  local  authorities  and  citizens  –  and 
what used to be one-way communication becomes two-way. 
Today in many cities, the Internet and the World Wide Web 
enable communities both to influence policy decisions and 
provide feedback on implementation of government projects. 
This can only enhance the accountability, transparency and 
effectiveness of municipal and other local authorities. 

In Morocco, the municipality of Fès gives the public access 
to records through an online portal. Municipal information 
kiosks  make  administrative  procedures  more  transparent, 
reducing  and  eliminating  bureaucratic  delays.  This  scheme, 
which  is  supported  by  the  International  Development 
Research Centre, is now replicated in northern Ghana, where 
information  technology  improves  local  governance  and  a 
climate  of  transparency  and  cooperation  encourages  civic 
participation.

Ultimately, of course, it is for every city to decide which 
political mechanisms, participation tools and implementation 
methods will make it more inclusive. Whatever their preferred 
option,  though,  municipal  authorities  must  establish 
local  information  systems  to  evaluate  the  effectiveness  of 
their  political  inclusion  policies;  for  instance,  they  will 
need  to  assess  whether  these  policies  effectively  enhance 
the  political  representation  of  traditionally  marginalized 
groups. Municipalities will also want to know whether such 
enhanced  representation  in  governance  systems  improves 
the  political  integration  of  marginalized  people,  such  as 
ethnic  minorities.  In  other  words,  a  municipality  should 
not assess participation based on such superficial indicators 
as  numbers  of  consultative  meetings  or  participants.  Since 
inclusiveness is less of a notional than a substantive outcome, 
municipal authorities must keep in mind that a participatory 
process is a transformational tool, the effectiveness of which 
is measured in the progress achieved on the way to a more 
equal, inclusive city.

5. Promote cultural inclusion.

Cultural rights through government coordination

Culture has historically been left out of the conventional 
international development agenda, or relegated to its fringes. 
Today,  more  and  more  scholars  and  experts  have  come  to 
recognize  that  past  development  strategies  (such  as  those 
associated  with  the  “Washington  Consensus”  on  economic 
reform)  have  failed  because  they  “saw  development  as  a 
technical  problem  requiring  technical  solutions  …  [with] 
little  attention  paid  to  institutional  constraints  or  cross-
cultural value differences”.60

Against  this  background,  some  cities  in  the  South  have 
opted for a more comprehensive perspective on development 
– one where culture features as one of the levers of success. 
Accordingly,  their  development  policies  integrate  cultural 
values,  social  capital,  tradition  and  other  related  factors.61 
At the same time, these municipalities are well aware that, 
conversely, culture can easily lead to social exclusion if aspects 
such as the right to diversity or free cultural expression are 
not properly addressed and turned into a force for the greater 
good. 

As more and more municipal authorities are finding now, 
the success of development policies also relies on a broader 
scope  –  including  for  implementation  –  which  takes  into 
account the diversity and the specific needs of communities. 
More  specifically, 
inclusive  municipalities  pay  greater 
attention to the symbolism and meanings residents attach to 
local space, the sense of belonging and territoriality among 
people, and optimal and sustainable use of resources by local 
groups.62  This  makes  it  possible  for  participatory  processes 
to speak to various communities’ own sense of identity and 
ways of thinking, which can only encourage trust and debate. 
This sense of empowerment and influence secures community 
adherence and support to development projects they perceive 
as  promoting  their  own  interests  and  values.  Bridging  the 
cultural  gap,  therefore,  plays  a  fundamental  role  in  forging 
citizenship – shaping local identities and facilitating various 
forms of expression and participation. 

Indeed,  as  Steven  Friedman  put  it,  “Cities  cannot  be 
inclusive if people are expected to deny who they are or where 
they come from, or if they are expected to relinquish their 
own  values  and  traditions,  in  order  for  them  to  be  part  of 
the  urban  polis..On  the  other  hand,  an  urban  community 
built purely on respect for difference cannot endure, let alone 
include all who live in it because a significant degree of agreed 
commonality is crucial if people are to live with one another.”63 
In this sense, culture itself must be a focus of development 
policies,  or,  as  noted  by  Mark  Brennan,  “it  can  be  seen  as 
presenting both the means and ends for development”.64 A 
number of cities today are using culture as a transformational 
tool to integrate ethnic minorities, preserve regional values, 
protect the heritage in the built environment and safeguard 
the linguistic and religious diversity of the city. Beyond the 
sole  cultural  sphere,  these  policies  together  can  go  a  long 
way towards bridging the urban divide in its other – social, 
political and economic – dimensions.

It  is  worth  noting  here  that  in  urban  areas,  progress  on 
the way to more effective cultural rights is often one of the 
outcomes  of  close  collaboration  among  national,  regional 
and local authorities. In Brazil, for instance, the three tiers 
of  government  are  implementing  the  National  Cultural 
Plan  (adopted  in  2008),  which  uses  the  social  and  civic 
dimensions of culture in various programmes and initiatives 
that  are  implemented  at  the  municipal  level;  these  include 
the  National  Museum  Policy,  the  Monumenta  programme, 
the “Live Culture Programme” and others.65 In South Africa, 
in the aftermath of xenophobic attacks in 2008, a number 
of  programmes  have  been  launched  in  Johannesburg  and 
other cities to promote cultural tolerance and cohesion with 
foreigners. Under these schemes, “Migrant Help Desks” have 
been established and “Anti-xenophobic Awareness Campaigns” 
launched  in  partnership  with  the  Department  of  Home 
Affairs  and  other  national  agencies.66  In  such  cooperative 
efforts,  local  authorities  focus  on  specifically  local  issues, 
concentrating on rehabilitation of historic neighbourhoods, 
laying  out  public  spaces  and  facilities  in  the  least  favoured 
urban  areas,  or  allowing  different  land  use  patterns  and 
diversified social land and housing schemes for people from 
different origins or social or economic backgrounds. As far as 
urban planning is concerned, some municipalities eliminate 
building codes and zoning standards that act as “architectural 
lines  of  divide”,  isolating  and  unfavourably  differentiating 
some  neighbourhoods  from  others;  instead,  new  standards 
take into account gender, ethnic as well as socio-cultural and 
linguistic differences, turning them into inclusionary factors 
rather than allowing them to generate further exclusion.67

Many  cities  are  making  efforts  to  democratize  access  to 
culture. The South African city-region of eThekwini (which 
includes  Durban)  is  upgrading  and  expanding  cultural 
venues and increasing capital investment in cultural centers. 
Bogotá,  Curitiba  and  Quito,  among  various  other  cities  in 
Latin  America,  are  extending  cultural  policies  to  marginal 
suburbs.  In  São  Paulo,  the  “Library  Bus  Project”  extends 
access  to  cultural  goods  to  children,  youth  and  the  elderly 
in underprivileged neighbourhoods.68 Medellín in Colombia 
is  building  five  large  public  parks,  each  with  a  library  or  a 
museum as symbols of cultural expression, social encounter 
and peace in the poorest areas.69 

Cities  are  coming  to  realize  that  cultural  activities  are  a 
significant source of growth and employment, too, with great 
potential to contribute to poverty reduction. This is why they 
often engage in urban renewal and rehabilitation programmes 
in  decaying  historic  neighbourhoods  and  traditional  urban 
cores,  rehabilitating  historic  buildings  as  part  of  heritage 
preservation policies. The overall rationale is to create business 
opportunities for local communities and develop specific local 
senses of identity. 

Other cities deploy cultural initiatives to develop a sense of 
space and belonging and to promote cultural diversity within 
communities. Some are developing appropriate policies and

actions to foster multiple and complementary identities as 
part  of  broader-ranging  policies  that  reinforce  citizenship 
through cultural development. Cultural activities have also 
contributed to building or maintaining peace and stability 
within  cities  and  regions,  particularly  in  multi-ethnic 
settings. This has been the case in Bogotá, as part of a conflict 
resolution and prevention programme. In Guatemala, formal 
recognition of Mayan customary law became an important 
factor both of genuine reform and internal peace agreements. 
These  and  other  initiatives  strengthen  the  role  of  culture 
in  development,  recognizing  it  as  a  positive  force  for  the 
transformation of society. 

Steps, levers and the inclusive city 

The review of practical steps and catalytic levers suggests 
that cities can, in fact, bridge the urban divide. By assessing 
their past, identifying ways to strengthen their institutions, 
working  through  relations  among  tiers  of  government, 
projecting  a  realistic  vision,  and  dedicating  resources 
equitably to redistribute opportunities, municipal authorities 
demonstrate that they can foster greater inclusion. Similarly, 
cities that concentrate systematically on support to the urban 
poor and make long-term investment in human capital can 
reduce the urban divide, just as cities that introduce levers 
(CCTs, land tenure systems, etc.) to remove market barriers 
can  achieve  far  more  sustainable  economic  opportunities. 
And cities that successfully implement transparent budgeting 
and  two-way  accountability  enhance  political  inclusion, 
just  as  cities  that  involve  ethnic  minorities  foster  cultural 
inclusion. Taken together, these steps and levers constitute 
a  formidable  set  of  instruments  with  which  cities  can  at 
once  address  the  economic,  social,  political,  and  cultural 
dimensions of inclusion. 

Two cross-cutting factors implicit in the review, and which 
underlie much of this Report, are political will and human 
agency. In virtually all examples, successful efforts to bridge 
the  urban  divide  were  produced  through  consensus  among 
diverse, often competing interests. The necessity of political 
will  and  human  agency  highlights  again  the  relevance  of 
the right to the city. As noted above, the concept resonates 
deeply in many cities. It speaks directly to the issue of human 
dignity  and,  as  such,  provides  a  vehicle  to  rally  political 
will  and  build  consensus.  Simply  put,  it  is  what  drives  the 
debate.  Not  all  cities  can  deploy  this  concept.  As  discussed 
earlier in this Report, context is important. Many cities have 
not experienced the political and cultural history that makes 
the  right  to  the  city  a  viable  instrument  for  social  change. 
Importantly, these cities are also pursuing inclusion, but elect 
to bridge the urban divide by other means. Theirs is an equally 
tough challenge. This is a search for politically and culturally 
appropriate methods that will disrupt complacency and create 
incentives  for  protagonists  to  break  the  status  quo  that  too 
often perpetuates inequality and exclusion. 

In all cities, whether they do or do not endorse the right to 
the city, the challenge is to deliver on the promise achieved 
through consensus. All-too frequently, the social contract is 
vulnerable to the next election or cycle of violence and fails 
to translate into education, employment, citizenship, respect, 
and  dignity.  The  sheer  extent  of  exclusion  and  the  strength 
of vested interests warrant sustained political will and human 
agency over the long term. 

As  the  results  of  UN-HABITAT’s  policy  analysis  show, 
closing  the  urban  divide  is  not  a  one-off  engagement.  It  is 
a  commitment  among  successive  leaders  of  cities,  social 
movements,  organized  labour,  businesses  and  the  general 
public to implement practical steps and catalytic levers so that 
the city, in fact, becomes more inclusive over time.

Cities are constantly changing. They are built, rebuilt, destroyed, transformed, occupied by different groups, and used 
for different functions. In the search for higher returns through better spatial structures, more efficient economies of 
scale and other benefits, cities generate a diversity of residential patterns. In this process, they are more often than 

not divided by visible and invisible borders, splitting “off-centre” and “central” areas, or the “higher” and the “lower” 

districts, as the Urban Divide is colloquially symbolized in many developing countries.

The Urban Divide can be characterized by various forms of inclusion/exclusion, integration/marginalization, wealth/

poverty, equality/inequality, formality and informality. Those on the wrong side of the divide are excluded of the 

benefits of urban expansion and prosperity. They are denied the urban advantage.

The most visible and measurable form of inclusion or exclusion is economic, and this Report reviews urban economic 
inequality based on new data. Other social, political and cultural factors are shown to be at work, too, from the latest 
research, policy analysis and available statistics. The urban poor and underprivileged – women and young people in 
particular – are exposed to various types of inequality, from planning and land policies (or their absence) to a lack 
of basic services, decent employment, education, nutrition, health care as well as civic and political freedoms and 

opportunities.

As this new edition of State of the World’s Cities demonstrates, the “Urban Divide” concept provides a theoretical 
framework that makes it possible to understand today’s urban realities, particularly in the developing world. From 
a more practical perspective, the concept highlights the four critical dimensions of the divide – social, economic, 

political and cultural – at work in many cities of the world today. 

The findings suggest that economic growth cannot, on its own, bring the redistributive change required to address 
urban exclusion. This Report advocates rights-based policies as the best way of “Bridging the Urban Divide”. These 
basic rights capture the four dimensions of exclusion/inclusion and are already endorsed, if only formally, in most 

national constitutions. Expert opinion from 27 representative cities pinpoints how the dynamics of inclusion can 

work in three major developing regions, as well as the predictable and less predictable interconnections between 

economic, social, political and cultural factors. Public authorities must tackle the four dimensions of inequality 
simultaneously; and this will not be feasible short of close institutional, policymaking and financial coordination 

between municipal, intermediary and central tiers of government.

This Report maps out five major policy steps across the urban divide and suggests how better to integrate the poor 
and marginalized into mainstream urban life. It shows with compelling evidence that determined governments are 
in a position to eliminate the divisions, and pave the way for more tolerance, diversity and social justice in the towns 

and cities of this world.
