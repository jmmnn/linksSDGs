The UNESCO Science Report 2010 has been produced by
the following team within the Division for Science Policy
and Sustainable Development at UNESCO:

Director of Publication: 
Editor: 
Administrative Assistant: 

Lidia Brito, Director
Susan Schneegans
Sarah Colautti

Every five years, the UNESCO Science Report series updates
the status of science worldwide. Each edition is heavily
reliant on the expertise of the authors invited to write
about the main trends and developments in scientific
research, innovation and higher education in the country
or region from which they hail. We would thus like to take
this opportunity to thank each of the 35 authors for their
commitment to making this an authoritative report. 

The picture they have painted in the following pages is of
a world that is changing at a quickening pace. A greater
number of chapters on individual countries have been
included in the present report than in its predecessor to
reflect the widening circle of countries emerging on the
world scene. No doubt the UNESCO Science Report 2015,
the next in the series, will have pursued its own mutation
by 2015 to reflect the world it seeks to depict. 

We would like to thank the following staff from the
UNESCO Institute for Statistics for contributing a vast
amount of data to the report: Simon Ellis, Ernesto
Fernández Polcuch, Martin Schaaper, Rohan Pathirage,
Zahia Salmi, Sirina Kerim-Dikeni and the Education
Indicators Team.

FOREWORD

The UNESCO Science Report 2010 holds a mirror to the
evolving status of science in the five years since its
predecessor was published in 2005. It shows in particular
how, while the disparities between countries and regions
remain huge, the proliferation of digital information and
communication technologies is increasingly modifying the
global picture. By making codified information accessible
worldwide, it is having a dramatic effect on the creation,
accumulation and dissemination of knowledge, while at the
same time providing specialized platforms for networking
by scientific communities operating at a global level.

The distribution of research and development (R&D) efforts
between North and South has changed with the emergence
of new players in the global economy. A bipolar world in
which science and technology (S&T) were dominated by the
Triad made up of the European Union, Japan and the USA is
gradually giving way to a multipolar world, with an
increasing number of public and private research hubs
spreading across North and South. Early and more recent
newcomers to the S&T arena, including the Republic of
Korea, Brazil, China or India, are creating a more competitive
global environment by developing their capacities in the
industrial, scientific and technological spheres. One
consequence is greater competition between countries to
attract scientific personnel from abroad and to retain or
recall their best researchers and graduates living abroad.

One encouraging finding of the report is that R&D funding has
continued to expand globally as the result of greater
recognition by governments worldwide of the crucial
importance of science for socio-economic development. Those
developing countries that have progressed fastest in recent
years are the ones that have adopted policies to promote
science, technology and innovation. Although Africa still lags
behind other regions, signs of progress can be found in some
countries on the continent, which today represents a growing
contributor to the global R&D effort. The continent’s mounting
contribution to the global stock of knowledge comes as good
news – all the more so since Africa is a priority for UNESCO. This
progression shows that deliberate, well-targeted policies can
make a difference when implemented with commitment and
dedication even in difficult circumstances.

However, the report also points to persistent disparities
between countries and, in particular, the marginal contribution
that the least developed countries (LDCs) make to global 

UNESCO SCIENCE REPORT 2010

science. This situation calls for all stakeholders, including
UNESCO, to renew their support to LDCs for investing in
science, transforming the policy environment and making the
necessary institutional adjustments – in other words, for
enabling S&T to realize its potential as a prime lever for
development. This is a vast and complex task that can only be
met through a major policy mobilization for science.
Mobilizing policy for science remains critical to building the
human and institutional capacities needed to overcome the
knowledge gap and empower developing countries to build
appropriate scientific research capabilities so as to address
national and global challenges. We have a moral imperative to
make science globally inclusive.

There are two possible scenarios for the way in which the
geopolitics of science will shape the future. One is based on
partnership and co-operation, and the other on efforts towards
national supremacy. I am convinced that, more than ever,
regional and international scientific co-operation is crucial to
addressing the interrelated, complex and growing global
challenges with which we are confronted. Increasingly,
international diplomacy will take the form of science
diplomacy in the years to come. In this respect, UNESCO must
and will pursue its efforts to strengthen international
partnerships and co-operation, in particular South–South co-
operation. This science dimension of diplomacy was one of the
original reasons for including science in UNESCO’s mandate. It
has fundamental significance for UNESCO nowadays, at a time
when science has tremendous power to shape the future of
humanity and when it no longer makes much sense to design
science policy in purely national terms. This is most vividly
evident in issues relating to global climate change and how
societies will address it through green economies.

In line with my intention to place science at the centre of
UNESCO’s efforts to eradicate extreme poverty and foster
social inclusion and sustainable development, I am
confident that the UNESCO Science Report 2010 will prove a
useful tool in the necessary redefinition of the science
policy agenda at national, regional and global levels and
will provide valuable insights into the prospects for science
and related policy challenges in the years ahead.

in the global economy

THE GLOBAL PICTURE 

The UNESCO Science Report 2010 takes up from where its
predecessor left off five years ago. The aim of this first
chapter is to provide a global overview of developments
over the past five years. We shall pay particular attention
to ‘new’, ‘less known’, or ‘unexpected’ features revealed by
the data and the chapters that follow. 

We shall begin by briefly reviewing the state of the
support system for science against the backdrop of the
long, historically unique period of rapid global economic
growth from 1996 to 2007. This ‘growth spurt’ has been
driven by new digital technologies and by the emergence
of a number of large countries on the world stage. It was
brought to a sudden and somewhat brutal halt by the
global economic recession triggered by the subprime
mortgage crisis in the USA in the third quarter of 2008.
What impact has this global economic recession had on
investment in knowledge? Before we endeavour to
answer this question, let us take a closer look at some of
the broad trends that have characterized the past decade. 

First and foremost, cheap and easy access to new digital
technologies such as broadband, Internet and mobile
phones have accelerated the diffusion of best-practice
technologies, revolutionized the internal and external
organization of research and facilitated the implantation
abroad of companies’ research and development (R&D)
centres (David and Foray, 2002). However, it is not only the
spread of digital information and communication
technologies (ICTs) that has shifted the balance in favour of
a more transparent and more level playing field1. The
growing membership and further development of global
institutional frameworks like the World Trade Organization
(WTO) governing international knowledge flows in trade,
investment and intellectual property rights have also sped
up access to critical knowledge. China, for example, only
became a member of WTO in December 2001. The playing
field now includes a wide variety of capital- and
organization-embedded forms of technology transfer
which include foreign direct investment (FDI), licenses and
other forms of formal and informal knowledge diffusion. 

Secondly, countries have been catching up rapidly in terms
of both economic growth and investment in knowledge, 

1.  This does not mean that each player has an equal chance of success but
rather that a greater number are playing by the same set of rules.

as expressed by investment in tertiary education and R&D.
This can be observed in the burgeoning number of
graduates in science and engineering. India, for example,
has opted to establish 30 new universities to raise student
enrollment from less than 15 million in 2007 to 21 million
by 2012. Large emerging developing countries such as
Brazil, China, India, Mexico and South Africa are also
spending more on R&D than before. This trend can also be
observed in the transition economies of the Russian
Federation (Russia) and some other Eastern and Central
European countries which are gradually climbing back to
the levels of investment under the Soviet Union. In some
cases, the rise in gross domestic expenditure on R&D
(GERD) has been a corollary of strong economic growth
rather than the reflection of greater R&D intensity. In Brazil
and India, for example, the GERD/GDP ratio has remained
stable, whereas in China it has climbed by 50% since 2002
to 1.54% (2008). Similarly, if the GERD/GDP ratio has
declined in some African countries, this is not symptomatic
of a weaker commitment to R&D. It simply reflects an
acceleration in economic growth thanks to oil extraction 
(in Angola, Equatorial Guinea, Nigeria, etc) and other non-
R&D-intensive sectors. If each country has different
priorities, the urge to catch up rapidly is irrepressible and
has, in turn, driven economic growth worldwide to the
highest level in recorded history.

Thirdly, the impact of the global recession on a post-2008
world is not yet reflected in the R&D data but it is evident
that the recession has, for the first time, challenged the old
North–South technology-based trade and growth models
(Krugman, 1970; Soete, 1981; Dosi et al., 1990). Increasingly,
the global economic recession appears to be challenging
Western scientific and technological (S&T) dominance.
Whereas Europe and the USA are struggling to free
themselves from the grips of the recession, firms from
emerging economies like Brazil, China, India and South
Africa are witnessing sustained domestic growth and
moving upstream in the value chain. Whereas these
emerging economies once served as a repository for the
outsourcing of manufacturing activities, they have now
moved on to autonomous process technology
development, product development, design and applied
research. China, India and a few other Asian countries,
together with some Arab Gulf states, have combined a
national targeted technology policy with the aggressive –
and successful – pursuit of better academic research within
a short space of time. To this end, they have made astute use
of both monetary and non-monetary incentives, as well as

institutional reforms. Although data are not easy to come by,
it is well-known that many academic leaders in American,
Australian and European universities have, in the past five
years, been offered positions and large research budgets in
fast-growing universities in East Asian countries. 

In short, achieving knowledge-intensive growth is no longer
the sole prerogative of the highly developed nations of the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
(OECD). Nor is it the sole prerogative of national policy-
making. Value creation depends increasingly on a better use
of knowledge, whatever the level of development, whatever
its form and whatever its origin: new product and process
technologies developed domestically, or the re-use and
novel combination of knowledge developed elsewhere. 
This applies to manufacturing, agriculture and services in
both the public and private sectors. Yet, at the same time,
there is striking evidence of the persistence – expansion even
– in the uneven distribution of research and innovation at
the global level. Here, we are no longer comparing countries
but regions within countries. Investment in R&D appears to
remain concentrated in a relatively small number of locations
within a given country2.  In Brazil, for example, 40% of GERD
is spent in the São Paulo region. The proportion is as high as
51% in South Africa’s Gauteng Province.

PRERECESSION FACTS AND FIGURES 

Economic trends: a unique growth spurt
Historically, global economic growth in the years bridging the
Millennia has been unique. Over the period 1996–2007, real
GDP per capita increased at an average annual rate of 1.88%3.
At the broad continental level, the highest per-capita growth
was witnessed by East Asia and the Pacific (5.85%), Europe
and Central Asia (4.87%) and South Asia (4.61%). The figure
was 2.42% for the Middle East and North Africa, 2.00% for
North America, 1.80% for Latin American and the Caribbean
and 1.64% for sub-Saharan Africa. The greatest divergence in
growth rates occurred in sub-Saharan Africa: in 28 countries,
GDP per capita grew by more than 5% but more than half of
the 16 countries which witnessed negative per-capita growth
rates were also in sub-Saharan Africa (Table 1).

3.  Growth rates reported in this section reflect the average annual increase
between 1996 and 2007 of per capita GDP in constant US$ 2 000 from
World Bank data.

Note: The sum of GERD for some regions does not correspond to the
total because of changes in the reference year. Furthermore, in
numerous developing countries, data do not cover all sectors of the
economy. Therefore, the data presented here for developing
countries can be considered a lower bound of their real R&D eﬀort.

The growing role of knowledge in the global economy

Figure 1 presents  the 20 largest economic powers in the
world. This list includes the Triad4 and the newly
industrializing countries of Mexico and the Republic of
Korea, some of the most populated countries in the world
such as China, India, Brazil, Russia and Indonesia, and a
second layer of emerging economies that include Turkey,
Saudi Arabia, Argentina and South Africa. With their
newfound economic weight, these countries are
challenging many of the rules, regulations and standards
that governed the G7 and the Triad with respect to
international trade and investment5. As we shall now see,
they are also challenging the traditional dominance of the
Triad when it comes to investment in R&D.

Trends in GERD: a shift in global influence
The world devoted 1.7% of GDP to R&D in 2007, a share
that has remained stable since 2002. In monetary terms,
however, this translates into US$ 1 146 billion6, an increase
of 45% over 2002 (Table 1). This is slightly higher than the
rise in GDP over the same period (43%). 

Moreover, behind this increase lies a shift in global
influence. Driven largely by China, India and the Republic
of Korea, Asia’s world share has risen from 27% to 32%,
to the detriment of the Triad. Most of the drop in the
European Union (EU) can be attributed to its three biggest
members: France, Germany and the United Kingdom (UK).
Meanwhile, the shares of Africa and the Arab States are
low but stable and Oceania has progressed slightly. 

We can see from Figure 1 that China’s share of world GERD
is approaching its world share of GDP, unlike Brazil or India
which still contribute much more to global GDP than to
global GERD. Of note is that the situation is reversed for
the Triad, even though the disparity is very small for the
EU. The Republic of Korea is an interesting case in point, in
that it follows the pattern of the Triad. Korea’s world share
of GERD is even double its world share of GDP. One of
Korea’s top priorities is to raise its GERD/GDP ratio to as
much as 5% by 2012. 

4.  Composed of the European Union, Japan and USA

Figure 2 correlates the density of both R&D and
researchers for a number of key countries and regions.
From this figure, we can see that Russia still has a much
greater number of researchers than financial resources in
its R&D system. Three large newcomers can be seen
emerging in the bottom left-hand side of the picture,
namely China, Brazil and India, together with Iran and
Turkey. Even Africa, as a continent, today represents a
sizeable contributor to the global R&D effort. The R&D
intensity of these economies or their human capital might
still be low but their contribution to the stock of world
knowledge is actually rising rapidly. By contrast, the group
of least developed countries – the smallest circle in the
figure – still plays a marginal role.

Catching up in business R&D
It is the trends in business investment in R&D (BERD) which
best illustrate the rapid geographical changes taking place
worldwide in privately funded R&D centres. Increasingly,
multinational companies are decentralizing their research
activities to parts of both the developed and developing
worlds within a strategy to internalize R&D at the global
level (Zanatta and Queiroz, 2007). For multinationals, this
strategy reduces labour costs and gives companies easier
access to markets, local human capital and knowledge, as
well as to the host country’s natural resources. 

The favoured destinations are the so-called Asian ‘tigers’,
the ‘old’ newly industrialized countries in Asia, and,
secondly, Brazil, India and China. However, this is no longer
a one-way traffic: firms from emerging economies are now
also buying up large firms in developed countries and
thereby acquiring the firms’ knowledge capital overnight,
as the chapter on India neatly illustrates. As a consequence,
the global distribution of R&D effort between North and
South is shifting rapidly. In 1990, more than 95% of R&D
was being carried out in the developed world and just
seven OECD economies accounted for more than 92% of
world R&D (Coe et al., 1997). By 2002, developed countries
accounted for less than 83% of the total and by 2007 for
76%. Furthermore, as the chapters on South Asia and sub-
Saharan Africa underscore, a number of countries not
generally considered to be R&D-intensive are developing
particular sectors like light engineering as a strategy for
import substitution, among them Bangladesh.

5.  The great majority of the standards governing, for instance, trade in
manufactured goods, agriculture and services are based on USA–EU norms.

6.  All US$ in the present chapter are purchasing power parity dollars.

From 2002 to 2007, the share of BERD in GDP rose sharply
in Japan, China and Singapore, with a particularly steep
curve in the Republic of Korea. The ratio remained more or

less constant in Brazil, the USA and the EU and even
declined in Russia. As a result, by 2007, the Republic of
Korea was challenging Japan for the title of technological
leader, Singapore had nearly caught up to the USA and
China was rubbing shoulders with the EU. 
Notwithstanding this, the BERD/GDP ratio still remains
much lower in India and Brazil than in the Triad. 

Trends in human capital: China soon to count the
most researchers
Here, we focus on another core area of R&D input: trends
with regard to researchers. As Table 2 highlights, China is
on the verge of overtaking both the USA and the EU in
terms of sheer numbers of researchers. These three giants
each represent about 20% of the world’s stock of
researchers. If we add Japan’s share (10%) and that of
Russia (7%), this highlights the extreme concentration of
researchers: the ‘Big Five’ account for about 35% of the
world population but three-quarters of all researchers. By
contrast, a populous country like India still represents only
2.2% of the world total and the entire continents of Latin
America and Africa just 3.5% and 2.2% respectively.

Although the share of researchers in the developing world
has grown from 30% in 2002 to 38% in 2007, two-thirds of
this growth can be attributed to China alone. Countries are
training many more scientists and engineers than before but
graduates are having trouble finding qualified positions or
attractive working conditions at home. As a result, migration
of highly qualified researchers from South to North has
become the characteristic feature of the past decade. A 2008
report by the UK Parliamentary Office cited OECD data
indicating that, of the 59 million migrants living in OECD
countries, 20 million were highly skilled.

Brain drain preoccupies developing countries
Despite voluminous literature on migration, it is almost
impossible to draw a systematic, quantitative picture of
long-term migration of the highly skilled worldwide.
Moreover, not everyone perceives the phenomenon in the
same way. Some refer to brain drain, others prefer the term
brain strain or brain circulation. Whatever the preferred
terminology, several chapters in the present report –
among them those on India, South Asia, Turkey and sub-
Saharan Africa – highlight the serious issue that brain drain

has become and the barriers that this flow of knowledge
out of countries creates for domestic R&D. For instance, 
a national survey by the Sri Lankan National Science
Foundation found that the number of economically active
scientists in Sri Lanka had dropped from 13 286 to 7 907
between 1996 and 2006. Meanwhile, FDI flowing into India
is creating internal brain drain, as domestic firms cannot
compete with the attractive compensation packages
offered to personnel by foreign firms based in India. 

South–South and South–North migration data are not
systematically covered by international statistical
institutes but can be approximated by combining OECD
data on migration of the highly skilled with UNESCO data
on bilateral flows of international students (Dunnewijk,
2008). These data reveal that South to North and North to
North are dominant directions for migration but that,
overall, a much more varied array of destinations is
emerging: South Africa, Russia, Ukraine, Malaysia and
Jordan have also become attractive destinations for the
highly skilled. The diaspora that has settled in South Africa
originated from Zimbabwe, Botswana, Namibia and
Lesotho; in Russia, from Kazakhstan, Ukraine and Belarus;
in Ukraine, from Brunei Darussalam; in the former
Czechoslovakia from Iran; in Malaysia from China and
India; in Romania from Moldova; in Jordan from the

Palestinian Autonomous Territories; in Tajikistan from
Uzbekistan; and in Bulgaria from Greece.

A second factor is that the diaspora acts as a useful
departure point for the design of policies for more
effective technology transfer and knowledge spillovers.
This phenomenon motivates countries to elaborate
policies to lure highly skilled expatriates back home. This
was the case in the Republic of Korea in the past and can
be seen in China and elsewhere today. The aim is to
encourage the diaspora to use the skills acquired abroad
to bring about structural change at home. Moreover, the
diaspora may be invited to participate ‘from a distance’, 
if the prospect of a permanent return home is unlikely. 
In Nigeria, Parliament approved the establishment of the
Nigerians in the Diaspora Commission in 2010, the aim of
which is to identify Nigerian specialists living abroad and
encourage them to participate in Nigerian policy and
project formulation.

Trends in publications: a new Triad dominates
The number of scientific publications recorded in
Thomson Reuters’ Science Citation Index (SCI) is the most
commonly used indicator for scientific output. It is
particularly valuable, in that it allows both for
international comparisons at the aggregate level and for

The growing role of knowledge in the global economy

more detailed assessments of particular scientific fields.
We begin with the aggregate analysis of scientific
publications. As Table 3 highlights, the USA is still the
country which leads the world when it comes to scientific
output in absolute terms. However, its world share (28%)
has fallen more than any other country over the past six
years. The leading region for this indicator, the EU, has also
seen its share dip by four percentage points to less than
37%. By contrast, China’s share has more than doubled in
just six years and now represents more than 10% of the
world total, second only to the USA, even if the citation
rate for Chinese articles remains much lower than for the
Triad. Next come Japan and Germany. They are now on a
par at just under 8%, Japan’s world share having fallen
farther than Germany’s. 

As for the BRIC7 countries, their share of world
publications has shown impressive growth, with the
exception of Russia, which saw its share decline from 
3.5% in 2002 to 2.7% in 2008. At the continental level, 

7. Brazil, Russian Federation, India and China

Latin America’s share leapt from 3.8% to 4.9% but this 
was mostly thanks to Brazil. Growth in the Arab world
remained sluggish. Africa’s share of publications in the 
SCI made a bound of 25% between 2002 and 2008 from 
a very low starting point to attain 2.0% of the world total.
Here, the rise was most noticeable in South Africa and the
Maghreb but every African country saw the number of its
articles recorded in the SCI progress. At the global level,
scientific publishing is today dominated by a new triad:
the USA, Europe and Asia. Given the size of Asia’s
population, one would expect it to become the dominant
scientific continent in the coming years.

In terms of the relative specialization of countries in
specific scientific disciplines, Figure 4 points to wide
disparities. The first spider’s web focuses on the
traditionally dominant scientific countries. The black
octagon represents the average, so the lines outside this
octagon indicate a better-than-average performance in a
given field. Of note is France’s specialization in
mathematics, recently confirmed by the award of the 
prestigious Fields Medal to two French mathematicians 
in 2010.

France also specializes in Earth and space sciences, like
Germany. As for Japan, it has several strengths: physics,
chemistry, engineering and technology. Interestingly,
both the USA and UK specialize in biomedical research,
clinical medicine and Earth and space. 

The second spider’s web focuses on the BRIC countries
and Africa. Here, too, we observe some striking differences
between countries in their scientific specialization. Russia
shows a strong specialization in physics, mathematics and
Earth and space sciences. Typically, China specializes
heavily in physics, chemistry, mathematics and
engineering and technology. By contrast, Africa and Brazil
are strong in biology and India excels in chemistry.

These differences in scientific specialization are mirrored
in the different country profiles that follow this first
chapter. Countries appear to choose areas for scientific
knowledge creation based on their own needs (clinical
medicine), geographical opportunities (Earth and space
sciences and biology) but also based on cultural affinities
(mathematics, physics) and expertise born of industrial
growth (chemistry).

Trends in scientific output: inequality in private
knowledge creation
The fourth indicator on which we focus in this first chapter
reflects the success of countries and regions in privately
appropriating knowledge through, for example, the
number of patents filed with the Triad patent offices,
namely: the US Patents and Trademark Office (USPTO),
European Patent Office and Japanese Patent Office. 
Patents filed with these three patent offices are generally
considered to be of a high quality. As a technological
indicator, patents are a good reflection of the strong
cumulative and tacit character of knowledge, embedded
as they are in a formally recognized, long-lasting
intellectual property right. It is this characteristic which
makes it costly to transfer knowledge from one setting to
another. 

The overall dominance of the USA is striking. This
highlights the US technology market’s role as the world’s
leading private market for technology licenses. Japan,
Germany and the Republic of Korea are the other
countries with the most patent-holders. India’s share
amounts to barely 0.2% of all Triadic patents, a share
comparable to that of Brazil (0.1%) and Russia (0.2%).
Table 4 illustrates the extreme concentration of patent

12

applications in North America, Asia and Europe; the rest of
the world barely accounts for 2% of the total stock of
patents. Most of Africa, Asia and Latin America play no role
at all.

India’s patents tend to be in chemistry-related fields.
Interestingly, the chapter on India considers that the
introduction of the Indian Patent Act in 2005 to bring
India into compliance with the Agreement on Trade-
Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) has
not had a negative effect on the country’s pharmaceutical
industry. In support of this argument, the author cites the
strong growth in R&D investment since 2000, which was
continuing unabated in 2008. However, he also observes
that most of these patents are being granted to foreign
companies located in India, based on R&D projects carried
out in India, in a growing trend. 

Of all the indicators used in the UNESCO Science Report, it
is the patent indicator which points most strikingly to the
inequality of knowledge creation at the global level.

The following trend helps to explain the huge volume of
patents among OECD economies. In high-income
countries, the lifespan of high-tech products is shortening,
obliging companies to come up with new products more
quickly than before. This can be seen in the rate at which
new computers, software, video games and mobile phones,
for instance, are appearing on the market. 
High-tech firms are themselves largely responsible for this
phenomenon, as they have deliberately set out to create
new consumer needs by bringing out more sophisticated
versions of their products every six months or so. This
strategy is also a way of keeping ahead of the competition,
wherever it may be. As a consequence, patents that used to
be economically valid for several years now have a shorter
lifespan. Developing new products and registering new
patents every six months or so is an extremely labour- and
investment-intensive exercise which obliges companies to
innovate at a frenetic rate. With the global recession,
companies are finding it harder to maintain this pace. 

Knowledge appropriation versus knowledge
diffusion
We now take a look at the opposite variable to patents, the
number of Internet users. This variable should enable us to
gauge whether easier access to information and
knowledge has provided opportunities for a more rapid
diffusion of S&T. The data on Internet usage in Table 5 paint

a very different picture to that for patents. We find that the
BRIC countries and numerous developing countries are
catching up quickly to the USA, Japan and major European
countries for this indicator. This shows the crucial
importance of the emergence of digital communications
like Internet on the world distribution of S&T and, more
broadly, knowledge generation. The rapid diffusion of
Internet in the South is one of the most promising new
trends of this Millennium, as it is likely to bring about a
greater convergence in access to S&T over time.

A systemic perspective on the congruence of S&T
indicators 
The concept of a national innovation system was coined
by the late Christopher Freeman in the late 1980s to
describe the much broader congruence in Japanese
society between all sorts of institutional networks in both
‘private and public sectors whose activities and
interactions initiate, import, modify and diffuse new
technologies’ (Freeman, 1987). The set of indicators
described above shed light on some features of each
country’s national system of innovation. One should bear
in mind, however, that science, technology and
innovation (STI) indicators that were relevant in the past
may be less relevant today and even misleading (Freeman
and Soete, 2009). Developing countries should not simply
rely on adopting STI indicators developed by, and for,
OECD countries but rather develop their own STI
indicators (Tijssen and Hollanders, 2006). Africa is
currently implementing a project to develop, adopt and
use common indicators to survey the continent’s progress
in S&T via the periodic publication of an African Innovation
Outlook (see page 299).

Figure 5 illustrates visually the different biases in
countries’ national innovation systems by matching four
indicators. At first sight, the US system appears to be the
most balanced: the US circles appear each time in the
middle of the figure. However, its position with respect to
human capital is weak and out of line with the trend in
other highly developed countries: only 24.5% of the US
population holds a tertiary degree, whereas in France,
Germany or Japan, for instance,the proportion  is close to,
or greater than, 30%. One would expect the USA to
perform better on the tertiary education axis, given its
performance for the indicators on the other axes. It is true
that the USA has some of the best universities in the
world but rankings like that of Shanghai Jiao Tong
University focus on research performance rather than the

14

quality of education. In sum, the USA is reliant on a vast
inflow of foreign researchers and other highly skilled
people to drive the economy.

The growing role of knowledge in the global economy

Japan provides a contrast. It clearly lags behind other
highly developed countries in terms of scientific
publications and GDP per capita. Its innovation system
appears weak when it comes to translating the country’s
big investment in human research capital and R&D into
sufficient scientific and economic value. The UK suffers
from exactly the opposite problem: its performance in
terms of scientific publications and economic wealth

creation is by far superior to its investment in human
research capital and R&D. Russia, on the other hand,
shines when it comes to investment in human capital 
but fails on all other counts. China is still typically in a
catching-up phase: its heavy investment in R&D has as
yet not paid off but, of course, its economic structure
remains dominated by non-technology-intensive
activities.

UNESCO SCIENCE REPORT 2010

The national biases in Figure 5 also point to some of the
implications for countries of the international migration of
researchers and more broadly human capital. It is not
surprising that there will be a lot of emigration from a country
like Russia and a lot of immigration towards the USA, given
the current biases in their national innovation systems.

IS THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC RECESSION
BAD FOR KNOWLEDGE CREATION?

The global recession is likely to have had a severe impact
on investment in knowledge across the globe. Many of the
knowledge indicators described for 2007 and earlier may
have been affected in the process and, hence, could not
reliably predict the situation in 2009 or 2010. R&D budgets,
especially, tend to be vulnerable to cutbacks in times of
crisis. Patents and publications will in turn be affected by

the drop in R&D expenditure but this will probably occur in
the longer run and affect scientific output less directly,
owing to pipeline effects that smother sharp fluctuations.
As for trends in education of the labour force, this sector
tends to be less affected by short-term distortions.

There are a couple of short-term indicators which might
shed some light on the impact of the recession thus far.
Here, we use the OECD´s composite leading indicator
(CLI), which is available on short notice. This indicator uses
monthly (de-trended) data on industrial production as a
proxy for economic activity. It is a leading indicator
because industrial production recovers early in an
economic cycle. A turning point in the CLI signals that a
turning point in the business cycle can be expected within
6–9 months. China showed a turning point as early as
November 2008 and, consequently, an upturn in the
business cycle in May–August 2009, as expected.

The growing role of knowledge in the global economy

We can also interpret from the information in Figure 6
that Brazil was 10% above its long-term level for
industrial production in 2007 before falling brutally to
about 85% of this value in the first month of 2009.
Industrial production in India and the Euro zone only
stumbled, falling from around 103% to 90%. Recovery is
expected to be strong enough to raise the level of
industrial production above its long-term trend level.
However, the data for the most recent months (June
2010) reveal that the rate of recovery is slowing down,
raising concerns about a possible double dip.

In short, we can say that, between October 2008 and
March 2009, the first signs of recovery appeared. Asia in
general and China in particular were the first to recover.
It is unlikely that R&D expenditure in China has been
affected by the global economic recession because
industrial production fell only 7% below its long-term
trend value for a relatively short period. Moreover,
circumstantial evidence on firms provided by the EU’s
R&D investment scoreboard in 2009 shows that China’s
R&D effort in 2008 actually increased, at least in
telecommunications. There is no reason to assume that
2009 and 2010 will be much different, since China’s
economy grew by more than 7% even in 2007 and
2008.

A CLOSER LOOK AT INDIVIDUAL
COUNTRIES AND REGIONS

The choice of countries and regions in the UNESCO
Science Report 2010 nicely reflects the heterogeneity
of S&T around the world, from the highly developed
OECD nations to the four large emerging BRIC
countries and the large number of developing
countries which are playing a growing role in the
global research effort. Here, we summarize the most
insightful conclusions emerging from the regional
and country studies in Chapters 2 to 21.

In the United States of America (Chapter 2), R&D has
prospered over the past five years and continues to be
an absolute government priority. A good example is
the funding for the National Science Foundation,
which doubled at the request of the Bush
administration in 2007 and is set to double again
under the Obama administration. Although the
recession born of the subprime crisis hit the economy
hard in 2009 and 2010, universities and research
centres have continued to receive generous funding
from both public funds and private endowments and
industrial funds. 

For Brazil and India, on the other hand, it is likely that
their total R&D effort will come under pressure in 2008
and 2009, due to the relatively low level of industrial
production over a prolonged period of time. In fact,
between July 2008 and March 2010, industrial
production remained below its long-term trend level.
On a brighter note, these countries have been catching
up to the developed countries in terms of GERD for
several years now. One might therefore expect more of a
lull in these countries’ rising R&D intensity than a
significant drop.

Whereas the Obama administration included a
significant one-off investment in STI that also
benefited R&D in the second stimulus package
towards the end of 2009, there is now a clear risk that
any increase in federal funding will be offset by
reductions in funding by both state governments
and private funds. Notwithstanding this, one
important commitment by the Obama
administration is to increase GERD from 2.7% to 3%
of GDP. The administration is emphasizing energy
R&D, especially clean energy. 

As for the world’s largest R&D-intensive firms,
circumstantial evidence for 2009 reveals that the majority
of the big R&D spenders in the USA cut their R&D
expenditure by 5–25% that year, while a minority
increased spending by 6–19%. Overall though, the USA
and EU are most likely to keep their total R&D intensity at
around 2007 levels. This means that both GDP and R&D
expenditure will decline by equal shares, thereby keeping
R&D intensity more or less constant over the year 2009–
2010 (Battelle, 2009).

Unlike public research, industrial R&D appears to
have been hit relatively hard by the recession with a
large number of researchers being laid off. Among
the biggest R&D spenders have been the
pharmaceutical industries, badly affected by the
recession. In fact, the chapter notes that the
pharmaceutical industry was already showing signs
of stress before the recession, as the huge
investment made in R&D does not appear to have
resulted in many ‘blockbuster’ drugs recently.

UNESCO SCIENCE REPORT 2010

The US university system still leads the world when it
comes to research: in 2006, 44% of all S&T articles
published in journals indexed in the SCI included at
least one US-based author. Furthermore, of the top 
25 institutions ranked by the Shanghai Jiao Tong
University’s Institute of Higher Education in 2008, 
19 were based in the USA.

Canada (Chapter 3) has been less affected by the
global economic recession than either the USA or
Europe, thanks to its strong banking system and a
real-estate market that avoided many of its
neighbour’s excesses. Furthermore, low inflation
coupled with income from Canada’s abundant natural
resources have cushioned the impact of the global
recession on the country’s economy. 

In March 2010, the federal government committed to
investing in a range of new measures to foster
research over the period 2010–2011. These include
postdoctoral fellowships, as well as more general
research funding for grant councils and regional
innovation clusters. A considerable share of this
funding goes towards research on particle and nuclear
physics, as well as next-generation satellite
technology. With the USA next door, Canada cannot
afford to be complacent. 

Steady investment in R&D appears to be paying off:
between 2002 and 2008, the number of Canadian
scientific publications in the SCI grew by nearly 
14 000. However, if Canada can boast of a dynamic
academic sector and generous public spending on
STI and R&D, many businesses have not yet
assimilated a ‘knowledge creation’ culture. Canada’s
productivity problem is first and foremost a business
innovation problem. The result of the poor R&D
performance in business is that academic research
often appears to be a surrogate for industrial R&D. 

The federal government has set out to foster public–
private partnerships recently via two successful
initiatives: an agreement between the federal
government and the Association of Canadian
Universities and Colleges to double the volume of
research and triple the number of research results
which are commercialized; and the Network of
Centres of Excellence, which now total 17 across the
country.

Chapter 4 on Latin America notes a persistent and
glaring income gap between rich and poor across the
continent. STI policies could play an important role in
reducing inequality. However, it is proving difficult to
establish ties between STI policies on the one hand
and social policies on the other. The structural
conditions prior to the global recession were
particularly favourable to reform, in that they
combined political stability with the longest period of
strong economic growth (2002–2008) that the region
had seen since 1980, thanks to a booming global
commodities market. 

Several Latin American countries have implemented
an array of policies to foster innovation, in particular
Argentina, Brazil and Chile. However, despite there
being about 30 types of STI policy instruments in use
across the region, national innovation systems
remain weak. This is the case even among such keen
proponents of STI policies as Brazil and Chile. The
major stumbling block is the lack of linkages
between the different actors of the national
innovation system. For instance, good research
coming out of the local academic sector does not
tend to be picked up and used by the local
productive sector. More generally, R&D investment
remains low and bureaucracies inefficient. Training
and building a critical mass of highly skilled
personnel has become another burning issue. 

The economic recession has generated an
employment crisis that may well exacerbate poverty
in the region and thus further increase the tension
between STI policy and specialization, on the one
hand, and poverty alleviation and social policies on
the other.

Brazil (Chapter 5) experienced a booming economy in
the years leading up to the global recession. Such a
healthy economy should be conducive to business
investment. However, patent numbers remain low and
R&D activities sluggish in the business sector, leaving
most of the funding effort to the public sector (55%).
In addition, the majority of researchers are academics
(63%) and the Brazilian economy is increasingly
suffering from a shortage of PhD graduates.
Researchers also remain unevenly spread across the
country with national output being dominated by a
handful of top universities.

The growing role of knowledge in the global economy

The federal government is conscious of the problem.
In 2007, it adopted a Plan of Action in Science,
Technology and Innovation for Brazilian Development
(2007–2010) which sets out to raise R&D expenditure
from 1.07% of GDP in 2007 to 1.5% of GDP in 2010.
Another target is to augment the number of
scholarships and fellowships available to university
students and researchers from 102 000 in 2007 to 
170 000 by 2011. One key objective is to nurture an
innovation-friendly environment in firms by
strengthening industrial, technological and export
policies, and increasing both the number of active
researchers in the private sector and the number of
business incubators and technoparks. 

Cuba (Chapter 6) is a particularly interesting case
study. Cuba’s human development is among the
highest in the region, on a par with Mexico. In terms
of overall spending on S&T, however, it has slipped
below the regional mean, the consequence of a
slightly lesser effort on Cuba’s part and, above all, a
greater commitment to S&T across Latin America.
Business funding in Cuba has halved in recent years
to just 18% of GERD. 

Cuban enrollment in higher education is impressive,
on the other hand, with first-year student rolls having
doubled between 2004–2005 and 2007–2008, thanks
largely to a surge in medical students. What is more,
in 2008, 53.5% of S&T professionals were women.
Many STI professionals work in public research
institutes across the country, although the low
number of researchers among R&D personnel (7%)
is troubling. 

The research strategy in Cuba is centred around a
number of National Research Programmes in
Science and Technology. A recent programme
focusing on ICT managed to increase Internet access
from 2% of the population in 2006 to nearly 12% a
year later.  Although Cuba is known for the
development and production of pharmaceuticals,
other priorities are emerging. These include energy
R&D and disaster monitoring and mitigation, in light
of the threat of stronger hurricanes, droughts, coral
bleaching and flooding in future as a consequence
of climate change. Cuba has begun modernizing its
research infrastructure, notably its meteorological
services.

The countries of the Caribbean Common Market
(Chapter 7) have suffered acutely from the peak in
international food and commodity prices in recent
years. Jamaica, for instance, spent more on
petroleum imports in 2007 than the total value of its
exports. This situation has been exacerbated by the
global recession, which has hit the crucial tourist
industry hard. 

Two of the region’s largest countries, Jamaica and
Trinidad and Tobago, have now put together long-
term development plans (Vision 2030 and Vision 2020,
respectively) that emphasize the importance of STI
for development. Expenditure on R&D remains
dismally low, however, and private R&D moribund.
Only the higher education sector is booming: two
new universities have been established since 2004 on
the island of Trinidad and the introduction of free
tertiary education in Trinidad and Tobago in 2006
caused student enrollment rates to rise overnight.
However, the leap in the student population has not
been matched by a proportionate increase in
academic staff numbers, putting research under
strain. The region has great expectations for the
Caribbean Science Foundation launched in
September 2010 to revitalize R&D.

As Chapter 8 on the European Union (EU) highlights,
the EU is increasingly a heterogeneous group of
countries. Although the new member states are
catching up in economic terms, there remains a
yawning gap between the richest and poorest
member states. When it comes to innovation, however,
this heterogeneity knows no borders. Regions within a
country that perform particularly well in innovation are
dotted across the EU rather than being confined to the
older (and richer) member states. 

Although the EU is the undisputed world leader for
publications recorded in the SCI, it is struggling to
increase expenditure on R&D and develop
innovation. This is visible in its inability to meet both
the Lisbon and Barcelona targets of raising GERD to
3% of GDP by 2010. Another issue member states are
struggling with across the EU concerns the
institutional reforms of the university system. The
dual challenge here is to improve the quality of
research and revitalize the EU’s poorly funded
institutions of higher education. 

19

Intro Chapter [18] [P3]:Layout 1  18/10/10  18:03  Page 20

UNESCO SCIENCE REPORT 2010

On a more positive note, what sets the EU apart from
many other regions is its willingness to acknowledge
that it can only improve its performance in STI and R&D
by pooling the capabilities of member states. This
attitude has spawned a number of multilateral
European agencies and programmes. These vary from
large research organizations like the European
Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) where
individual countries collaborate on the EU’s Framework
Programmes for Research and Technological
Development to the Joint Technology Initiative and
EUREKA, designed to stimulate research in industry. 
A number of new EU organizations have been set up,
or are in the process of being set up, including the
European Science Foundation and European Institute
of Innovation and Technology, as well as funding
agencies like the European Research Council.

Until the global economic recession hit in late 2008, all
countries in Southeast Europe (Chapter 9) were
growing at an average rate of around 3% a year.
However, the region is particularly heterogeneous in
terms of its socio-economic development, with a ten-
fold difference between the richest (such as Greece and
Slovenia) and poorest (Moldova) countries. Whereas the
most advanced countries are implementing EU-focused
strategies with an emphasis on innovation, the stragglers
are still at the stage of attempting to design or
implement a basic S&T policy and establish an R&D
system. Two of the smaller countries are, of course, still in
their infancy: Montenegro only gained independence in
2006 and Kosovo in 2008. 

Today, demand for R&D and skilled personnel
remains low in all but Slovenia, despite a growing
number of tertiary graduates. Two reasons for the
lack of demand for R&D are the small size of firms
and their lack of capacity. For the non-EU members
in the region, European integration represents the
only viable project for ensuring social and political
coherence. Without strong STI policies, the region is
in danger of falling further behind the rest of Europe.

Turkey (Chapter 10) has been emphasizing STI policies in
recent years. Between 2003 and 2007, GERD more than
doubled and business expenditure on R&D grew by 60%.
Domestic patent filings and grants also rose more than
four-fold from 2002 to 2007. It is the private sector that
has been driving economic growth since 2003. 

20

A number of policy measures have been put in place
to support STI. These include the Vision 2023 Project
in 2002–2004, the launch of the Turkish Research
Area in 2004 and a major five-year implementation
plan for the National Science and Technology Strategy
(2005–2010). The Ninth Development Plan (2007–
2013) has likewise focused on STI as a building block
for Turkey. 

However, challenges remain. The Vision 2023 Project
was a technology foresight exercise but it has
unfortunately not spawned any policy initiatives to
build capacity in priority technology areas. Moreover,
the density of researchers remains poor and
enrollment in tertiary education is lower than for
countries with a similar income. Turkey also has an
underdeveloped venture capital market and an
insufficient number of high-growth firms. The
government has introduced a number of measures 
to stimulate private-sector R&D, foster university–
industry collaboration and develop international 
co-operation in R&D. These measures include tax
incentives for technoparks, of which there were 
18 in 2008.

The Russian Federation (Chapter 11) had been
experiencing an economic boom in the years before
the severe economic downturn towards the end of
2008. This was largely due to high oil prices, an initial
weak currency and strong domestic demand. Both
consumption and investment were high. The country
reacted to the crisis by adopting an extensive recovery
package but it is feared that this package may
increase the government’s tendency to intervene
directly in the economy rather than furthering the
kind of institutional reform needed to bring about
modernization, especially as regards STI policy. 

Without such institutional reforms, the national
innovation system will continue to suffer from poor
linkages between the different actors. Currently, there
is a lack of co-ordination across departments, 
a high level of administrative complexity and poor
linkages between science, academia and industry.
These factors all act as barriers to co-operation and
innovation. A notable feature is the imbalance
between the country’s STI performance and the
growing mass of financial resources dedicated to 
R&D but jealously guarded within public research

The growing role of knowledge in the global economy

institutions where they are out of reach for industry
and universities. As a result, universities play a minor
role in new knowledge creation: they contribute just
6.7% of GERD, a stable figure for the past two decades,
and only one in three universities performs R&D,
compared to half in 1995. Private universities hardly
perform any research at all. The higher education
system has undergone widespread reform in recent
years with the introduction of bachelor’s and masters
programmes which now cohabit with the Soviet
degree system. By 2009, more than half of university
staff held the equivalent of a PhD. 

virtually shut down for many years under the
previous presidency. In Uzbekistan, a key measure
has been the establishment of a Committee for the
Co-ordination of the Development of Science and
Technology in 2006. After identifying seven priority
areas for R&D, the committee invited universities and
scientific organizations to submit research proposals
within a competitive bidding process. By the end of
2011, some 1098 projects will have been
implemented within 25 broad research programmes
in basic and applied research and experimental
development.

STI policies need to allow for greater academic mobility
and co-operation; they also need to lay the groundwork
for a radical modernization of the professional training
of scientists and engineers. The latter point is all the
more urgent in light of the country’s ageing research
population: 40% are above the official retirement age.
Boosting support for university research has become
one of the most important strategic orientations of STI
and education policies in Russia. Since 2006, the
National Priority Project for Education and a follow-up
programme have provided 84 universities considered
to be centres of excellence with an additional 
US$ 30 million each approximately to promote human
resource development, high-quality R&D and
educational projects, as well as permit the acquisition
of research equipment. 

No country in Central Asia (Chapter 12) devotes
more than 0.25% of GDP to R&D. This is even the case
for Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, the countries with
the most developed science systems. Other concerns
are the ageing ‘Soviet-generation’ research
population and an inadequate legal framework
which is partly responsible for the low level of
innovation by scientific organizations and private
enterprises. 

STI policy initiatives in the region include the
Intellectual Nation 2020 programme unveiled in
Kazakhstan in 2009. It plans to develop a network 
of schools in natural and exact sciences for gifted
pupils and to raise GERD to 2.5% of GDP by 2020.
Kazakhstan can already count on several technoparks.
Tajikistan has also adopted a plan for S&T covering
2007–2015. As for Turkmenistan, it has also witnessed
a revival of science since 2007, after research was

Chapter 13 on the Arab States analyses the reasons
for the lack of a national S&T strategy or policy in
most Arab states, although all have sectoral policies
for agriculture, water, energy and so on. Even where
S&T strategies exist, innovation tends to be absent
from these, primarily due to weak linkages between
public and private R&D. However, Bahrain, Morocco,
Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, the United Arab Emirates,
followed more recently by Jordan and Egypt, are
tackling this issue by setting up science parks. 

S&T policies and strategies are also beginning to
emerge. Saudi Arabia adopted a national plan for S&T
back in 2003 and, in 2006, Qatar implemented a five-
year plan to increase GERD to 2.8% (from 0.33%). The
planned submission of an S&T strategy for the entire
Arab region to the Arab summit in 2011 for adoption
is another promising sign. The future plan is expected
to address the important issue of facilitating the
mobility of scientists within the region and to
enhance collaborative research with the sizeable
community of expatriate Arab scientists. It is also
expected to propose both national and pan-Arab
initiatives in about 14 priority areas, including water,
food, agriculture and energy. The plan may also
recommend the launch of an online Arab S&T
observatory, as a key to implementing measures at
the country level will lie in first identifying some of
the national challenges that Arab countries face. 

Also promising is the number of funds for STI set up in
the region in recent years. These include the 2008 
EU–Egypt Innovation Fund and two national funds:
the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Foundation in
the United Arab Emirates (2007) and the Middle East
Science Fund in Jordan (2009).

UNESCO SCIENCE REPORT 2010

Chapter 14 on sub-Saharan Africa highlights the
move by a growing number of African countries to
enhance their S&T capacity as part of poverty
alleviation strategies. In 2008 alone, 14 countries
requested UNESCO’s assistance with science policy
reviews. Although GDP per capita rose in the
majority of African countries between 2002 and
2008, it remains low by world standards, a factor
which has an impact on investment in STI. Moreover,
GERD still attracts less public funding than the
military, health or education sectors. South Africa is
the only country which comes close to the 1% mark
for R&D intensity (0.93%  in 2007). 

South Africa also dominates scientific publications,
representing a 46.4% of the sub-continent’s share, far
ahead of the two next most prolific countries, Nigeria
(11.4%) and Kenya (6.6%). Of note is that the number
of articles recorded in the SCI has progressed for all
sub-Saharan countries, even if only 17 could count
more than 100 articles in this database in 2008.

A major challenge is the low literacy rate and poor
quality of education, even if both literacy and
enrollment rates have climbed in the past decade. To
address these issues, the African Union issued a Plan
of Action for the Second Decade of Education for Africa
in 2006. Another major challenge is brain drain: at
least one-third of all African researchers were living
and working abroad in 2009. A growing number of
countries are tackling the root cause of this problem
by raising the salaries of academics and providing
other incentives. Cameroon, for instance, used the
writing-off of part of its debt to create a permanent
fund in early 2009 which tripled the salaries of
academics overnight. The number of academics
appears to have already swelled by about one-third
and the volume of scientific articles produced by
state universities has likewise risen.

Five years after the adoption of Africa’s Science and
Technology Consolidated Plan of Action (CPA) covering
the period 2008–2013, progress has been made in
biosciences and water research and the first set of
pan-African R&D statistics is due to be delivered in
2010. Concern has been voiced in some quarters,
however, at the rate of progress. The CPA is intended
to act as a framework for channelling greater funds
into S&T across the continent but, five years on, the

22

proposed mechanism for channelling this funding,
the African Science and Innovation Facility, has not
yet materialized. 

South Asia (Chapter 15) has enjoyed reasonably
good growth rates in the past few years and not
suffered unduly from the global recession, with the
notable exception of Pakistan which has seen its
growth rates drop from 6.8% in 2007 to 2.7% in
2009. Pakistan is the country that spends the most
on R&D (0.67% of GDP in 2007), IT and higher
education of the countries under study, which do
not include India and Iran. However, most R&D
funding in Pakistan is consumed by the military
sector (60%). 

The region suffers from a lack of investment in STI.
Moreover, there is a lack of linkages between public
and private actors and no university–industry
collaboration to speak of. It is noted in the chapter
that, overall, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka seem
better at producing basic knowledge than
commercializing it. It will be interesting to follow the
fortunes of the Sri Lanka Institute of Nanotechnology,
which was set up in 2008 within a joint venture
between the National Science Foundation and
domestic corporate giants that include Brindix,
Dialog and Hayleys. The new institute professes to
take ‘an industry-focused approach’.

In addition to the lack of innovation, South Asia
suffers from low levels of literacy and education.
Governments face the dual challenges of widening
access while simultaneously making the education
system relevant to the national economy. They are
aware of the task at hand: Afghanistan, Bangladesh,
Pakistan and Sri Lanka are all at various stages of
higher education reform. Fortunately, they can count
on several high-quality academic institutions in the
region. 

Iran (Chapter 16) is heavily reliant on its oil industry,
which currently accounts for four-fifths of GDP. 
This situation weighs heavily on the country’s 
STI policies, since these are not a priority for
generating future prosperity. With research being
funded mostly (73%) out of the public purse and
with an interventionist government pursuing its own
priorities, R&D tends to be focused on nuclear

The growing role of knowledge in the global economy

technology, nanotechnology, satellite launching and
stem cell research. Policy research bears little
relevance to national issues and remains cut off from
socio-economic realities. 

The most recent document outlining Iran’s strategy
for S&T is enshrined in the Fourth Development Plan
(2005–2009). It focuses mainly on improving the
university system at a time of strong demand for
higher education: 81 000 students graduated in
2009, compared to 10 000 nine years earlier.

India (Chapter 17) is one of the world’s fastest-
growing economies, alongside China. Having been
relatively spared by the global recession, it is
pursuing a path of rapid growth. The past few years
have seen a rise in private investment in R&D, with
the majority of new companies belonging to
knowledge-intensive sectors. A growing number of
foreign companies are also establishing R&D centres
on Indian soil. Most of these foreign centres focus on
ICTs. In fact, India has become the world’s leading
exporter of IT services. Aerospace exports are also
growing by 74% a year. Meanwhile, major Indian
companies like Tata have been investing in high-tech
companies abroad, in pursuit of technology. 

In 2003, the government committed to raising
overall research expenditure from 0.8% to 2% of GDP
by 2007. Although GERD had only attained 0.88% of
GDP in 2008, this target sent a clear signal that public
policy was focusing on R&D. Moreover, the Eleventh
Five-Year Plan to 2012 not only emphasizes
innovation but also foresees a massive outlay on STI
via a budgetary increase of 220%. 

There is a general trend in India towards recognizing
the ‘I’ in STI in both the policy and business sectors.
Moreover, the adoption of the Indian Patent Act in
2005 to bring India into compliance with the TRIPS
agreement has not caused the domestic
pharmaceutical industry to slump, contrary to
predictions. The pharmaceutical industry is
flourishing, even if the domination of foreign firms in
patents continues to cast a shadow. Another
challenge is the steady flow of highly skilled people
out of India and out of domestic firms unable to
compete with the advantages offered by their India-
based foreign rivals. The biggest challenge of all,

however, will be for India to improve both the
quantity and quality of Indian S&T personnel. 
The central government’s decision to create 
30 universities across the country, including 
14 world-class innovation universities, augurs 
well for the future.

China (Chapter 18) has made great strides in
economic development in the past decade with
consistently impressive growth rates. In August 2010,
China even overtook Japan to become the second-
largest national economy in the world. Its R&D
intensity has also been multiplied by a factor of six.
Today, only the USA publishes more scientific articles,
although the impact factor of Chinese articles in the
SCI remains much lower than for the Triad, China
figuring just behind the Republic of Korea and on a
par with India for citations of scientific papers.

The government has issued a number of key policies
in the past four years to maintain a high growth rate
and become an innovation-driven nation by 2020,
the ambitious target of the Outline of the Medium-
and Long-term Plan for National Science and
Technology Development adopted in 2005. The main
mechanisms incite enterprises to invest more in
innovation and Chinese researchers to return home
from abroad. The government also plans to recruit
2000 foreign experts over the next 5 –10 years to
work in national laboratories, leading enterprises
and research institutes, as well as in a number of
universities. Another target is to raise the GERD/GDP
ratio from 1.5% to 2.5% by 2020.

In parallel, the Eleventh Five-Year Plan to 2010 is
developing STI infrastructure at a gruelling pace,
with 12 new megafacilities and 300 national key
laboratories planned, among other institutions.
Another focus is the environment. As part of the
strategy to reduce energy consumption and
emissions of major pollutants, the government plans
to ensure that non-fossil energy sources represent
15% of energy consumption by 2020. 

Today, the main barriers to innovation are the
rapidly growing innovation risk that enterprises face,
the lack of support for systemic innovation and
exploration, and weak market demand for
innovation.

UNESCO SCIENCE REPORT 2010

Japan (Chapter 19) was hit hard by the global recession
in 2008. After stagnating at around 2% between 2002
and 2007, growth in GDP dropped below zero,
plunging major companies into distress and resulting in
bankruptcies and a surge in unemployment rates. 

Japanese manufacturers have traditionally excelled in
steadily improving production processes and
accumulating production know-how within their
organizations to achieve the ultimate goal of high-
quality products at competitive prices. However, this
Japanese model is losing its effectiveness in many
industrial fields, as China, the Republic of Korea and
other nations with lower labour costs emerge as tough
competitors. Under such circumstances, Japanese
manufacturers have come to believe that they must
constantly innovate to survive in the global market. 

One consequence of this new mindset has been the
rapid expansion in university–industry collaboration in
recent years, resulting in numerous university start-ups.
In parallel, both R&D expenditure and the number of
researchers seem to be rising in the private sector. 
In fact, Japan retains a dominant STI position in key
industries such as automobiles, electronic components,
digital cameras and machine tools. 

In 2004, all Japanese universities were semi-privatized
and turned into 'national university corporations', with
both faculty and staff losing their status as public
servants. The chapter argues that many academic
policies imported chiefly from the USA, such as
competitive R&D funding, centres of excellence and a
shift towards more frequent temporary academic
positions, may have undermined the unique features of
the existing university system by helping the top
universities but damaging R&D capacities at other
universities and destroying old domestic research
networks. 

Chapter 20 focuses on what is probably the world’s
most committed country to STI: the Republic of Korea.
It had been enjoying high growth rates for a decade
before GDP shrank by 5.6% in 2008. Nevertheless, by
2009, the economy was already expanding again,
thanks to a government-led stimulus package. Part of
that package included greater R&D funding to
stimulate national STI. As a result, public spending on
R&D actually grew in 2008–2009. 

24

The Republic of Korea considers STI to be at the heart
of economic progress and crucial to achieving a
number of national goals. One of the top priorities is
to increase GERD to an impressive 5% by 2012, up
from an already high 3.4% in 2008. Strong investment
is coupled with strong policies. For instance, Initiatives
for Establishing a National Technology Innovation
System was implemented in 2004 with 30 priority
tasks. In 2008, the new government implemented a
follow-on strategy called the Science and Technology
Basic Plan (2008–2013) which has set itself as many as
50 priority tasks. These two plans now constitute the
basic framework for STI policy. In addition, a low
carbon, green growth policy was declared a key
national agenda in 2008.

The final chapter on Southeast Asia and Oceania
(Chapter 21) covers a vast geographical area
stretching from Australia and New Zealand to
Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia and the 22 Pacific
Island countries and territories. The global economic
recession has largely spared this part of the world. 

In Cambodia, Thailand and Fiji, science is given a low
priority so the global recession has had little impact.
Countries more attached to STI, such as Singapore,
Australia and New Zealand, reacted to the recession
by sharpening their STI policies and aligning them
more on national priorities. One R&D priority common
to just about all countries in the region is sustainable
development and the role that STI can play in
combating climate change.

Singapore stands out as the region’s most rapidly
growing investor in science. Between 2000 and 2007,
its R&D intensity climbed from 1.9% to 2.5%.
According to the World Bank, only Viet Nam and
Singapore improved their ranking in the Knowledge
Index between 1995 and 2008. Growth has been
largely driven by Singapore-based scientists, many of
whom have come from abroad to work in its well-
funded laboratories. Between 2000 and 2007, the
number of FTE researchers rose by 50% to an
impressive 6 088 per million population. A key
national strategy has been to cluster research
institutes in ICTs and biomedical research into two
national knowledge hubs. This strategy has paid off, as
Singapore is an emerging hub for biomedical and
engineering technologies.

The growing role of knowledge in the global economy

However, Singapore is not the only country in the
region to have shifted its focus from S&T policies to STI
policies. Moreover, there is a growing emphasis in the
region on cross-sector R&D, such as through
collaborative-project funding schemes. The face of
collaborative research is changing. The rapid rise of
China and India has had a knock-on effect on S&T
capacity in Southeast Asia and Oceania. For example,
the commodities boom led largely by India and China
in recent years fed mining-related R&D in Australia,
resulting in greater business R&D. 

It is no coincidence that academics based in China and
India figure among the top three countries of origin
for co-authors in several countries in the region.
Researchers are also spending more time abroad as
part of their training and ongoing collaborative
projects. There is clearly a higher level of international
engagement and co-operation in the region than
before.

CONCLUSION

Key messages
What conclusions can be drawn from the analysis above?
First and foremost, the disparity in development levels
from one country and region to another remains striking.
In 2007, per-capita income in the USA was estimated to
be 30 times higher on average than in sub-Saharan
Africa. Differences in economic growth rates have been
compounded over the years, leading to ‘divergence, big
time’ over the past 150 years in income levels between
rich and poor countries. In the late 19th century, for
instance, Nigeria was considered to be no more than a
decade behind the United Kingdom in terms of
technological development. The origin of this
divergence in economic growth can be found in the
disparate levels of investment in knowledge over long
periods of time. Even today, the USA still invests more in
R&D than the rest of the G7 countries combined. Four-
fifths of the world’s top universities also happen to be on
American soil.

The past decade has challenged this picture, largely
thanks to the proliferation of digital ICTs, which have
made codified knowledge accessible worldwide. For sure,
some early  newcomers, like the Republic of Korea, had
been steadily catching up to, and even leap-frogging over,

countries since the 20th century by developing first their
industrial capacity then S&T. But others, such as China,
Brazil or India, have initiated a new, three-way process of
catching up simultaneously in the industrial, scientific and
technological spheres. 

As a result, the past five years on which the present
UNESCO Science Report focuses have really begun to
challenge the traditional leadership of the USA. The
global economic recession has compounded the
situation, even if it is too early for this to be fully
encapsulated in the data. The USA has been harder hit
than Brazil, China or India, thereby enabling these three
countries to progress faster than they would have done
otherwise. Furthermore, as highlighted in the chapters
on China and India, we seem to be on the verge of a
structural break in the pattern of knowledge
contribution to growth at the level of the global
economy. This is also reflected in the arrival on the world
scene of large, multinational firms from emerging
countries which are moving into a wide variety of sectors
that range from mature industries such as steel-making,
automobile manufacturing and consumer goods to
high-tech industries like pharmaceuticals and aircraft
manufacturing. Companies in these emerging
economies are increasingly opting for cross-border
mergers and acquisitions to secure technological
knowledge overnight. 

Thirdly, the increase in the stock of ‘world knowledge’, as
epitomized by new digital technologies and discoveries
in life sciences or nanotechnologies, is creating fantastic
opportunities for emerging nations to attain higher
levels of social welfare and productivity. It is in this 
sense that the old notion of a technological gap can
today be considered a blessing for those economies
possessing sufficient absorptive capacity and efficiency
to enable them to exploit their ‘advantage of relative
backwardness’. Countries lagging behind can grow faster
than the early leaders of technology by building on the
backlog of unexploited technology and benefiting from
lower risks. They are already managing to leapfrog over
the expensive investment in infrastructure that
mobilized the finances of developed countries in the 
20th century, thanks to the development of wireless
telecommunications and wireless education (via
satellites, etc), wireless energy (windmills, solar panels,
etc) and wireless health (telemedicine, portable medical
scanners, etc).

UNESCO SCIENCE REPORT 2010

Other factors are also creating unique advantages in
terms of knowledge growth. This is particularly well
illustrated by the rapidly expanding pool of highly skilled
labour in China and India, among others, the large
numbers of redundant workers in farming and petty
trade, the relative gain in the replacement of obsolete
equipment with state-of-the-art technologies and the
spillover effects of investment in new technology. The
recognition of the importance of knowledge acquisition
is a common thread running through all chapters. In
Bangladesh, for instance, light engineering is producing
import-substitution products that are creating
employment and alleviating poverty. Endogenous
technologies include ferries, power plants, machinery
and spare parts. But Bangladesh is also developing the
high-tech sector of pharmaceuticals. It is now 97% self-
sufficient in pharmaceuticals and even exports them to
Europe. 

Fourthly, there is growing recognition that it is the
systemic ‘congruence’ between the various knowledge
components of the innovation system that counts when
it comes to devising a successful growth strategy, as we
have seen in Figure 5. In many mainly middle- and high-
income countries, there is a distinct shift occurring from
S&T policy to STI policy. This is having the effect of
steering countries away from the linear approach
starting with basic research and ending up with
innovation towards more complex, systemic notions of
innovation. University–industry collaboration, centres of
excellence and competitive research funding are all
becoming popular among countries looking to increase
their STI capacity. However, as the chapter on Japan
illustrates, such shifts are not easy to implement. At a
time when Japan’s global influence in R&D is slipping
somewhat, the author of this chapter argues that the
‘imported’ policies cited above may have damaged the
existing academic system in Japan, favouring the best
institutions to the detriment of others which have been
allowed to fall behind. It is true that, now and then,
‘imported’ policies will indeed conflict with ‘home-
grown’ policies. To complicate matters further, even
countries which have integrated this systemic
congruence in their STI policies still tend to
underestimate it in their overall development policies.

Fifthly, there is a growing emphasis in STI policy on
sustainability and green technologies. This trend can be
found in practically every single chapter of the UNESCO

26

Science Report, even in parts of the world not generally
characterized by a large STI effort, such as in the Arab
region and sub-Saharan Africa. This holds not only for
clean energy and climate research but also for the
repercussions on S&T fields upstream. Space science and
technology, for example, are a rapidly growing field for
many developing and emerging countries. Driven by
concerns about climate change and environmental
degradation, developing countries are attempting to
monitor their territory more closely, often via North–
South or South–South collaboration, as in the case of
Brazil and China for the design of Earth observation
satellites, or via projects like Kopernicus–Africa involving
the African Union and European Union. At the same
time, space science and technology are of course being
harnessed to provide ICT infrastructure for use in
wireless applications in health, education and other
fields. Climate change-related research has emerged as
an R&D priority when it was almost totally absent from
the UNESCO Science Report 2005. As a general broad
policy comment, one can today reasonably argue that
laggard regions or nations always do well to improve
their absorptive capacity and remove any ‘barriers’
preventing the flow of positive technological spillovers
from technologically leading economies, be they from
the North or South.

Last but not least, national STI policies clearly face a
radically new global landscape today, one in which the
territorial policy focus is coming under severe pressure.
On the one hand, the steep drop in the marginal cost of
reproduction and diffusion of information has led to a
world in which geographical borders are less and less
relevant for research and innovation. Knowledge
accumulation and knowledge diffusion are able to take
place at a faster pace, involving a growing number of
new entrants and providing a threat to established
institutions and positions. This globalizing trend affects
research and innovation in a variety of ways. On the
other hand, contrary to a possibly somewhat simplistic
reasoning, globalization does not lead to a flat world,
one in which gaps in research and innovation
capabilities across countries and regions are constantly
narrowed. Quite to the contrary, if there is clear evidence
of a concentration of knowledge production and
innovation emerging across a wider variety of countries
than before within Asia, Africa and Latin America, this
knowledge is growing at a highly differentiated pace
within countries.

INTRODUCTION

Research and development (R&D) in the United States of
America (USA) have prospered over the five years since the
UNESCO Science Report 2005 was published. The political
environment has remained conducive to a large federal role
in defence and basic research, while the universities have
continued to strive for excellence in research and teaching,
beneficiaries of generous federal subventions and project
support. Operating in a friendly policy environment,
companies have invested unprecedented amounts in
research. The threatening cloud on the horizon for R&D is
the global economic recession. 

The economic downturn first became visible in the USA in
the last quarter of 2008, after the collapse of the country’s
credit system in what has become known as the subprime
mortgage crisis. The crisis first hit the world’s headlines
after the federal government refused to bail out Lehman
Brothers. The firm filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection on 15 September 2008. American International
Group, the world’s largest insurer, was bailed out the next
day at an eventual cost of between US$134 billion and
US$180 billion. In the following weeks, several leading
lending institutions also folded, including Bear Stearns.
Others would be saved in extremis by federal intervention. 

By the end of 2008, millions of mortgaged American
homes had been seized by creditors. Between June 2008
and June 2009, 2 million jobs were lost. Unemployment
rose from nearly 4% to about 10% of the working
population, a deterioration not seen in over 25 years.
By early 2009, two of the three leading car manufacturers
were having to be bailed out by the federal government.
Both General Motors and Chrysler were later reorganized
following bankruptcy. As of May 2009, GDP had
contracted by slightly more than 3% on an annual basis,
with a low of 6.4% for the first quarter. 

At the time of writing in October 2009, GDP had
expanded for the first time in a year in the third quarter at
an annual rate of 3.5%, according to the Department of
Commerce. Economists were fearful, however, that the
recovery might not last, as government programmes to
stimulate consumer spending were due to expire and
both public debt and unemployment kept rising steadily.

In the same issue in which its Breakthrough of the Year
was announced on 19 December 2008 (Box 1), the

American journal Science featured a one-page article
entitled Breakdown of the year: financial meltdown. The
credit crisis will undoubtedly have negative repercussions
for investment in R&D in the USA, as in other countries,
and may delay the commercialization of promising
technologies. Although the Science article did not point
the finger at the economists whose risk models were
partially responsible for the financial crisis, nor at the
handful of PhD physicists who were employed on high
salaries by Wall Street firms to conduct such analyses, 
they were clearly culpable to some extent for the 
financial meltdown. 

S&T IN THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION 

On 20 January 2009, Barack H. Obama was sworn in as the
USA’s 44th President after George W. Bush’s eight years in office.
The global economic recession President Obama inherited has
provided a unique backdrop for his administration and its
stance on science and technology (S&T).

In response to the deepening crisis, the incoming Obama
administration proposed a second economic stimulus
package which was approved by Congress – the US
parliament – in February 2009. This package included
significant one-time funding for federal S&T organizations
through 2010. The Administration’s detailed budget
request for fiscal year 2010, submitted to Congress during
the first week of May 2009, also included significant
requests for these organizations.

The president articulated his vision of the future in an
address to the National Academy of Sciences on 29 April
2009. He pledged an increase in gross domestic expenditure
on R&D (GERD) from 2.7% to 3% of GDP, requiring a rise in
both government and industrial expenditure. This, he
emphasized, would contribute to the development of less
expensive solar cells, learning software that could provide
superior computer tutorials and, above all, alternative, clean
energy sources. ‘Energy,’ he asserted, ‘is this generation’s
great project.’ He suggested that the USA should commit
itself to reducing carbon pollution by 50% by 2050 against
the 1990 base year. To this end, he reiterated his intention to
create an Advanced Research Project Agency for Energy
(ARPA-E) within the Department of Energy. This agency
would be analogous to the Department of Defense’s
Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA) in conducting
high-risk, high-reward research.

UNESCO SCIENCE REPORT 2010

If there is a common thread running through President
Obama’s S&T policies, funding and people, it is a
commitment to a green future: reducing greenhouse
gasses and using clean energy. This commitment is
reflected in stronger standards for vehicle efficiency 
(CAFÉ standards) and proposals for a ‘cap and trade’
regime to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 

There is also a renewed emphasis on federal involvement
in industrial technology development and a tilt towards
fewer controls on some controversial research, such as that
utilizing stem cells. It remains to be seen how these trends
will endure beyond the current economic recession. 

The fundamental policies that have undergirded the
support for R&D in the USA for more than a half a century
are expected to remain in place. These include generous
federal support for basic research and a policy
environment favourable to private-sector funding of R&D. 

Overall, the Obama administration and the Democratic
majority in Congress – the President himself being a
Democrat – are expected to be more amenable to
federal R&D expenditure than the Republican party,
especially when it comes to federal programmes that
strengthen industrial R&D. President Obama appears to
be engaged on science issues and is known as a ‘science
guy’. His policy changes include new guidelines on
embryonic stem cell research. These new guidelines
allow federal funding for research only on new stem cell
lines created from surplus embryos at fertility clinics.
They include rigorous eligibility standards and lines
created in the laboratory to study particular diseases are
not allowed. The New York Times, in an editorial of 22
April 2009, complained that the new guidelines were
‘disappointing’. The guidelines under President Bush,
themselves a political compromise, permitted federal
funding of research on 21 cell lines. The Obama
guidelines also appear to be a political compromise but
lean further towards the free scientific enquiry end of
the spectrum. In July 2009, the Obama Administration
further modified its rules regarding stem cell research in
response to criticisms reported in the April New York
Times editorial. 

Of greater structural policy importance is an Obama
memorandum insulating scientific decisions by federal
government officials from political influence. Freedom of
scientific enquiry is a cornerstone of any effective science

30

policy regime and, in the modern world of federally
funded research, the government role is central. Life for
dissenters, even in science, has always been tough. The
real test of this policy will be whether federal funding of
scientific opinions not ‘politically correct’ will flourish.

Funding
President Obama views investment in science, technology
and innovation (STI) as important components of the
nation’s economy, as emphasized in both his stimulus
package and his 7 May budget request for R&D in his
proposed budget for fiscal year 2010. 

In a speech to the National Academy of Sciences on
29 April 2009, the president promised to meet two
important benchmarks:

I  firstly, that the nation would carry GERD to 3% of GDP
by the time he left office, compared with the unofficial
estimate of 2.7% for 2008. This ratio has never reached
or exceeded 3%; it peaked at 2.9%, in 1962;

I secondly, that the research and experimentation tax
credit would be made permanent. This is a tax credit
for R&D investment by industrial firms which has been
renewed by Congress periodically. 

The president’s promise has been greeted favourably by
industry. Both pledges require substantial investment by
industry and a concomitant favourable industrial research
policy environment.

People
Material to the effects of these budget increases are the S&T
leaders in the new administration. They have the
responsibility to implement these increases wisely and to
advise on how best to deploy S&T in the service of the nation.

The Obama administration has a strong S&T team. The
fact that important appointments were made early on
sent a positive signal. President Obama’s choice for
Science Advisor and Assistant to the President for Science
and Technology was John Holdren, former head of the
Harvard Kennedy School’s Science, Technology, Public
Policy Program at the Belfer Center for Science and
International Affairs. Holdren is a strong supporter of
controls on greenhouse gases. He has also, in the past,
expressed support for clean coal and advanced nuclear
technologies. Holdren has identified five major
challenges for the nation: applying S&T to (1) the

heads the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric

Administration (NOAA). Lisa Jackson, a chemical engineer, is

Box 1: Breakthroughs of the year

Scientists working at American
institutions – many of them foreign-
born or working in collaboration with
scientists from other countries – have
continued to obtain important results
across a broad spectrum of scientific
fields since the UNESCO Science Report
2005 was published. These
breakthroughs include both
discoveries with potential for
commercial application and those
that serve primarily to deepen human
understanding of the physical and
living Universe.

Each December, Science, the

respected journal of the American
Association for the Advancement of
Science (AAAS), publishes an article on
what it entitles the Breakthrough of the
Year. Here are the ‘winners’ in recent
years from the USA and elsewhere:

(2004) Martian exploration
Science selected two robots launched
by the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration (NASA) as its
breakthrough of the year. Opportunity
and Spirit, which roamed over
different portions of Mars, both
discovered evidence that water may
once have existed on the planet.    
If water did once exist on Mars, as
was confirmed in 2008 by other
Martian rover robots, then some form
of life may once have existed, or may
still exist, on the planet.

(2005) The Poincaré Conjecture
In 1904, the French mathematician
Henri Poincaré advanced a conjecture
in the branch of mathematics known
as topology – that is, the study of the
surfaces of multidimensional objects.
(The surface of a three-dimensional
object has two dimensions; that of an
N-dimensional object, N-1
dimensions.) Poincaré proved that
differences in surfaces of any
N-dimensional object differ only in
the number of their holes. He then
conjectured that a three-dimensional
space that is the surface of a four-
dimensional object cannot ‘hide any
interesting topology’ from what he
referred to as the ‘fundamental group’.
Mathematicians had proved
‘analogous statements for spaces of
every dimension higher than three’ by
the early 1980s but proof of Poincaré’s
original conjecture for three-
dimensional spaces was not
forthcoming until 2002 when the
Russian mathematician, Grigori
Perelman, who had collaborated
earlier with the American
mathematician Richard Hamilton, built
on Hamilton’s work to publish the first
of three papers demonstrating how
any type of three-dimensional surface
can evolve into another without
encountering any roadblocks, known
to typologists as 'singularities'. In 2006,
topologists reached the consensus

that Perelman had, in fact, proved the
Poincaré conjecture.

(2006) Evolution in action
Science focused on a pair of results
which deepened our understanding
of Darwinian evolution, as well as the
relationship between humans and
other primates. The first of these
breakthroughs occurred ‘in September
[when] an international team
published the genome of […] the
chimpanzee’. These results indicated
that humans and chimps differ by only
about 1% in the nucleotide bases of
their respective genomes, or by
approximately 4% of their DNA. The
second set of results concerned the
emergence of new species, which
form ‘when existing populations of
species begin to adapt in different
ways and eventually stop
interbreeding’. Two separate teams of
researchers found evidence for the
ways in which this speciation occurs in
European blackcaps, a type of warbler
found in Germany and Austria, as well
as in European corn borers living
throughout Western Europe.

(2007) Human genetic variation
and disease 
In 2001, the sequencing of the
human genome was completed and
its results were made available to 

continued

researchers throughout the world.
Geneticists then turned their attention
to how minute differences in the
genomes of individuals differentiate
them from one another. In 2005, the
UK’s Wellcome Trust recruited
200 researchers from several countries
to analyse the DNA of 17 000 people.
Significant results for 2007 focused on
type 2 (adult-onset) diabetes genes,
including the discovery of four new
diabetes-associated gene variants.
‘New gene associations now exist for
heart disease, breast cancer, restless
leg syndrome, atrial fibrillation,
glaucoma, amyotropic lateral sclerosis,
multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis,
colorectal cancer, ankylosing
spondylitis and autoimmune diseases.’

(2008) Seeing exoplanets
Prior to 2008, astronomers had
succeeded in using indirect  methods
to identify over 300 exoplanets, that is,
planets orbiting stars other than our
Sun. The most common of these
indirect methods measures the slight
wobbling of a star, indicating variation
of the gravitational attraction between
the star and a massive, orbiting object.
During 2008, at least four groups
reported direct, telescopic
observations of the light from the
mother star by orbiting exoplanets.
Since the light emitted from the star
itself is significantly brighter than the
light reflected from a daughter planet,
sophisticated techniques are required
to pinpoint the latter. Exoplanets
identified thus far – including those
reported prior to 2008 – are typically
considerably more massive than the
planet Jupiter, itself one million times
more massive than Earth.

Significant technological advances will
be required if exoplanets with masses
comparable to Earth are to be
detected.

Other frontier discoveries
In recent years, ‘runner-up’ discoveries
have included: 

I (2004) the discovery by Australian
researchers of a new, tiny species
of hominid in Indonesia known as
the Hobbit;

I (2005) the discovery by

astrophysicists of the first known
binary system of pulsars. Runners-
up for 2005 also included the
landing of the first human-made
object on a moon of another
planet, Titan, a satellite of Saturn;

I (2006) the identification by plant

molecular biologists of the identity
of florigen, a signal that initiates the
seasonal development of flowers;

I (2006) Sequencing of more than

one million base pairs of
Neanderthal DNA, completed by
researchers in Europe and the
USA, concluding that
Neanderthals diverged from our
own ancestors approximately
450 000 years ago and suggesting
that Neanderthals and modern
humans may have interbred;

I (2007) the demonstration by
glaciologists that the great ice
sheets covering Greenland and
Antarctica are shrinking at a
considerably greater rate than
had previously been expected;

I (2008) the discovery that, when

different classes of crystals of
substances known as transition
oxides are placed in layers, the
results could herald the birth of
new types of micro-devices to
rival those which now dominate
the electronics industry, silicon-
based devices;

I (2008) a systematic survey of

many genes in cancer cells
detected genetic mistakes which
led to the breakdown of normal
cell division. In 2008, reports on
the genetic flaws leading to
pancreatic cancer and
glioblastoma, two of the most
deadly forms of cancer, were
announced;

I (2008) a new catalyst, a mixture of

cobalt and phosphorus, uses
electricity to separate water
molecules into their constituent
hydrogen and oxygen atoms. If
developed on an industrial scale,
this catalyst could serve as the
basis for storing energy derived
from wind, solar and other
sources for later use. Researchers
have known for some time that
platinum provides a catalyst for
the separation of water into its
constituents. However, since
platinum is rare and expensive,
the newly identified
cobalt–phosphorus catalyst could
provide the means for making
significantly more effective use of
renewable energy sources.

R&D INPUT
R&D expenditure 
GERD in the USA has continued to rise since the turn of
the century, reaching an estimated US $368.1 billion in
2007. Private industry contributed approximately 67% of
the total and the federal government 27% (Figure 1). 

These numbers are derived from data provided by the
National Science Foundation (NSF). This body is required
by law to gather, analyse and disseminate a large variety
of data related to S&T, including GERD. Whereas data on
federal government expenditure are readily accessible to
the NSF, those related to industry and other funding
sources are obtained via surveys, which require more time
to gather and analyse. For this reason, GERD data

appearing in subsequent sections of the present chapter
which were obtained from other sources are sometimes
given for 2008 or, in rare cases, 2009. Additionally, the R&D
Budget Program of the American Association for the
Advancement of Science (AAAS) provides estimates of
federal expenditure for both 2008 and 2009. These data,
however, relate to the president’s requested budget
submitted to Congress in February or March each year,
rather than to actual congressional appropriations which
are not finalized until late the same year or, in some cases,
early the following year. 

Figure 2 shows trends in GERD by funding source between
1990 and 2007, expressed in both current and 2000
constant (that is, inflation-adjusted) US dollars. 

The USA consistently invests more money in R&D than
the rest of the G8 countries combined. Its share of G7
expenditure on R&D has fluctuated between 48% and
53% over the past 25 years and has exceeded 50% since
1997.1 In 2006, the USA’s share of the G7 total was 53%. 

1. Russian data only go back to 1990, which is why comparisons dating
back to the 1980s speak of the G7 rather than the G8.

In 2007, the ratio of GERD to GDP in the USA was 2.67%,
down from its most recent high of 2.81% in 2003. The
NSF’s unofficial estimate for 2008 is 2.70%. With a
GERD/GDP ratio of 3.67% in 2007, Japan is the only G8
country with a higher ratio. However, several smaller
countries have also boasted higher GERD/GDP ratios than
the USA in recent years: Israel 4.71% (2005), Sweden
3.64% (2007), Finland 3.47% (2007), Republic of Korea
3.37% (2008), Switzerland 2.93% (2004), and Iceland 2.86%
(2003). 

Figure 3 shows the trend in GERD for the USA and the
other G8 countries since 1990. Usually, but not always,
high GERD/GDP ratios for smaller countries signal the
presence of large multinational companies with
associated large R&D budgets. Such is also the case in the
USA. In 2004, R&D expenditure for multinational

corporations headquartered in the USA amounted to
approximately US$152.4 billion. Microsoft, for example,
invested US$7.8 billion in R&D, the highest of any
multinational corporation. Others headquartered in the
USA with significant expenditure were Pfizer
(US$7.7 billion), Ford (US$7.4 billion), General Motors
(US$6.5 billion), IBM (US$5.7 billion), Johnson and
Johnson (US$5.2 billion) and Intel ($4.8 billion).

R&D AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT 

Federal funding
In fiscal year 2008, covering the period to 30 September
2008, the federal government obligated an estimated 
US$112.8 billion for GERD. Table 1 shows the estimated
breakdown of federal expenditure on R&D in 2008 by

major socio-economic objective. Of the total, a little
over half was devoted to national defence and one-
fifth to health. The USA is unique both among
countries of the Organisation for Economic 
Co-operation and Development (OECD) and G7
countries in its heavy emphasis on defence and health. 

Principal supporting agencies
Although more than 25 federal agencies report GERD
obligations, only seven reported GERD obligations in
excess of US$1 billion in 2007. The budget of these
agencies accounted for over 96% of federal GERD, or
approximately US$108 billion.2

The principal funding sources and performers of R&D in
the Department of Health and Human Services are the
National Institutes of Health. A significant change since
the UNESCO Science Report 2005 in terms of federal
support for R&D is that seven rather than six federal

appropriations for fiscal year 2007, since several agencies are permitted to
carry over unexpended funds from one fiscal year to the next, including
the Department of Defense.

agencies are now in the billion-dollar R&D club and
account for over 96% of federal expenditure (Table 2). The
Department of Homeland Security, created in response to
the jihadist attacks on the USA of 11 September 2001,
combined bureaux within several existing cabinet
departments; it has now joined the ranks of those principal
performers and supporters of federal expenditure on R&D.

The American Reinvestment and Recovery Act (2009)
On 9 February 2009, Congress enacted the American
Recovery and Reinvestment Act, commonly known as the
stimulus package, which President Barack Obama signed
into law a week later, on 17 February. The rationale and
general outline of the Act had been proposed by Obama
on 6 January, two weeks prior to his inauguration. The
approximately US$800 billion stimulus package contains
substantial funding for S&T, in excess of US$30 billion.
These investments are made in the context of the Obama
administration’s emphasis on clean energy, education,
basic research, health care, broadband communications,
medical discoveries and infrastructure such as roads and
schools. Specific R&D increases found in the stimulus
package include:

President Obama’s budget request for 2010
On 7 May 2009, President Obama submitted his detailed
budget request to Congress for fiscal year 2010 beginning on
1 October 2009. This included an appeal for R&D of
US$147.4 billion, an increase of US$555 million over the
previous fiscal year appropriated by Congress and an amount
over and above that provided in the February stimulus
package. Of this amount, US$29.4 billion was earmarked for
basic research (Table 2), US$29.7 billion for applied research
and the balance for technological development. 

In fiscal year 2007, Congress had accepted the Bush
administration’s request to double the budgets of the
National Science Foundation (NSF), the Office of Science of
the Department of Energy and the National Institute of
Standards and Technology. The Obama administration’s fiscal
year 2010 request is on track to double the budget of these
three organizations by fiscal year 2016. 

The role of ‘mission agencies’
With a single exception, all of the federal government’s
cabinet departments and independent agencies that
perform and/or support R&D do so in pursuit of their
congressionally mandated missions. The exception, the NSF,
was mandated by Congress at the time of its creation in 1950
to ‘advance the progress of science’ by supporting science
and engineering research in universities, colleges and other
non-profit institutions, as well as mathematics, science and
engineering education at all levels. The NSF has since
enjoyed functional autonomy.

UNESCO SCIENCE REPORT 2010

Of the federal government’s US$94.2 billion in R&D
expenditure for 2007, US$24.4 billion was devoted to
activities in laboratories and other facilities managed
directly by a federal department or agency. Among the
latter, the 27 research facilities of the National Institutes of
Health (NIH), most of them located in Bethesda in the
State of Maryland, immediately north of Washington, DC,
provide the principal example. In 2007, just under 10% of
NIH’s US$28.4 billion budget was allocated to research in
these 27 facilities. The remainder was allocated to awards
for university faculty, most often in medical schools, in the
form of research grants based on competitive, peer-
reviewed proposals. Many of these research projects
involve large, expensive epidemiological studies. 

Federally Funded R&D Centers
An additional US$13.2 billion from the 2007 federal
budget for R&D was allocated to the 37 Federally Funded
Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs), often called
national laboratories. Specific to the USA, these centres
are managed by universities, companies and non-profit
institutions on behalf of the federal government and with
its full support. Of these 37 centres, 16 are university-
managed, 5 are industry-managed and 16 are managed
by non-profit organizations. 

Sixteen of the FFRDCs are funded by the Department of
Energy (DoE) and managed on its behalf. These
16 organizations performed R&D funded to the tune of
almost US$9 billion during fiscal year 2006, three-
quarters of the R&D performed by all the FFRDCs
combined. Approximately 60% of DoE’s R&D budget is
allocated to supporting these facilities. DoE-supported
FFRDCs include the Los Alamos, Livermore and Sandia
National Laboratories, which were originally established
for the purpose of developing nuclear weapons,
beginning with Los Alamos in 1943. Although the first
two had been managed from the outset by the
University of California, DoE announced in 2003 its
intention to open up their management to bids from
other potential contractors. Both are now managed by
consortia which include both the University of California
and a number of industrial organizations. Four of the
FFRDCs reported expenditure on R&D of more than
US$1 billion in fiscal year 2006: Los Alamos National
Laboratory, Sandia National Laboratory, the Jet
Propulsion Laboratory (managed by the California
Institute of Technology on behalf of NASA) and the
Livermore National Laboratory.

38

DoE-supported national laboratories also include several
whose purpose is to house and maintain large-scale
research facilities on behalf of university users groups,
including the Ernest Orlando Lawrence Berkeley
Laboratory managed by the University of California and
the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory managed by a
consortium of universities known as Associated
Universities Inc. 

In addition to those supported by DoE, nine FFRDCs are
supported by the Department of Defense (DoD), an
additional five by the National Science Foundation which,
by law, cannot operate its own research facilities, and one
each by NASA, the NIH, the Department of Homeland
Security, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the National
Security Agency and the Internal Revenue Service.

S&T IN INDUSTRY 

The effect of the recession on industrial R&D
The year 2008 began with an optimistic outlook for
industrial R&D funding. The annual Industrial Research
Institute (IRI) survey of projections of member companies
– which perform the majority of industrial R&D in the USA
– indicated robust growth for total company R&D.
Companies planned to increase hiring of new graduates
to conduct R&D. The ratio of R&D to sales was projected to
rise, indicating an increase in technological intensity.

The economic climate deteriorated dramatically
throughout 2008 and well into 2009. Although industrial
R&D rose to its highest level in 2007 and 2008, reliable
projections in mid-2010 showed a levelling out in 2009
and even a modest reduction in 2010. Pfizer Inc.
announced in January 2009 that it was laying off as many
as 800 researchers, 5–8% of its 10 000 research employees.
Pfizer has the biggest R&D budget of any drug-maker
(US$7.5 billion). The large pharmaceutical companies have
had a lot of trouble designing effective strategies for R&D,
due to the ‘lumpy’ or irregular pay-off resulting from the
‘blockbuster’ drug model that requires a huge financial
investment in development and testing. Some industry
experts call for ‘big pharmas’ to buy more of the new drugs
for their pipelines rather than develop these in house.

On 29 April 2009, the IRI hailed the Obama administration’s
R&D spending plans as ‘the largest commitment to scientific
research and innovation in US history, more than what was

spent at the height of the space race in 1964’. However,
painful changes are likely in industry. As IRI President Edward
Bernstein noted, ‘Now more than ever, R&D groups are under
pressure to restructure their organizational and
technological capabilities in key areas.’

The business-oriented Wall Street Journal took a generally
optimistic view of R&D in industry in a front-page article
dated 6 April 2009. The Journal provides a contrasting view of
multinationals Apple and Motorola, pointing out that Apple
boosted R&D spending by 42% between 1999 and 2002,
resulting in the iPod and iTunes lines. Motorola, on the other
hand, slashed R&D spending by 13% in 2002, causing R&D
expenditure to trail revenue. Motorola’s market share and
stock price have since plummeted. The Journal states, ’ R&D
spenders say they’ve learned from past downturns that they
must invest through tough times if they hope to compete
when the economy improves.’

The bottom line appears to be a likelihood of substantial
reductions in industrial R&D during the economic recession,
probably lagging behind the economic indicators by a year
or so, both on the way down and on the way up. The carrot of
future products and sales may well limit the depth of the
R&D recession but turmoil is likely. This will cause many
companies to rethink their overall R&D and innovation
strategies, probably strengthening the open innovation
option growing so popular.

Formal research strategies and budgets for 2009 may show
small increases but early indications are that 2009 and
probably 2010 will likely show contractions in funding of
industrial R&D. In some companies, there have already been
large lay-offs of research staff, resulting from economic
pressure and a realization that money alone will not fill the
product pipeline.

An impending downturn in funding for 
industrial R&D
The impending downturn in funding of industrial R&D will
come as something of a ‘culture shock’, as industrial R&D has
prospered in recent decades in the USA. In 2007, the last year
for which NSF estimates are available, industry funded 67%
of national R&D and performed 72%. A year earlier, the
figures were 65% and 71% respectively. With hindsight, this
appears to be a fluctuation rather than a trend: in 2007, the
ratio of industrial GERD to GDP was 1.88%, compared with
1.85% in 2001; comparable ratios for federal expenditure
were 0.64% and 0.69%, respectively.

United States of America

The overall growth in GERD has far outpaced that for GDP in
real terms for over 50 years, with industrial R&D growing
much faster than federal R&D. For example, in 1953, the non-
federal (mostly industry) GERD/GDP ratio (0.63%) was only
one-third that of 2007 (1.95%). The comparable federal
numbers are 0.73% and 0.71%, a slight decrease over this
long period. Industrial R&D has contributed most of the real
growth in US R&D. This trend demonstrates the increasing
importance of industrial technology in a growing US
economy. Companies have been putting their money where
their mouths are.

A market advantage dependent on ‘spending enough’ 
Technological intensity varies between industries,
companies and countries. It is relatively easy, in principle,
to measure input to the innovation chain, the ultimate
reason companies invest in R&D. Measuring output is
much more difficult, since management, government
policy environments and pure luck play such important
roles. It is probable that market advantage depends on a
company spending ‘enough’ on R&D, according to the
norms of its industry group; beyond that, managerial and
strategic considerations – not to mention luck – appear to
control the outcome.

Measures of technological intensity include the ratio 
of R&D to net sales, GERD/GDP ratio, high-tech
manufacturing exports, patents and R&D per employee.
Each of these presents problems. For example, high-tech
products can be manufactured and assembled by
multinational companies in countries with little scientific
infrastructure. Nothing more than a moderately educated
labour force, incentives and good management are
necessary.

Figure 4 shows the US trade balance for high-tech goods.
The swing from a surplus for the USA to a large deficit
over the period from the mid-1990s to the present
occurred in spite of the USA’s lead in technology during
this period. Competitive considerations led to less
expensive offshore manufacturing strategies, with China
being the preferred host country, followed by India. 

The GERD/GDP ratio tends to fluctuate in the USA between
2.5% and 3%,  depending on the relative growth of R&D
and GDP. Most large industrialized countries have similar
ratios. The ratio for non-federal R&D has steadily increased
since 1953, from about 0.7% to about 2%, a healthy
indicator of the technological intensity of industry.

United States of America

One commonly used measure is the R&D/net sales ratio. This
ratio in the USA currently hovers around 3.7% for those
companies doing R&D (Table 3). There is a huge difference in
this ratio from one industry to another, with the R&D/net
sales ratio for software and Internet being 10 times that of
chemicals and energy. Within particular industries, large
companies tend to have higher ratios than small ones. 

local markets. Over the past decade, about 85% of the
combined global R&D expenditure by US multinationals has
been spent at home. Foreign affiliates’ R&D expenditure grew
at a faster rate than US parents and the share of foreign
affiliates’ R&D expenditure within US multinationals rose 
one-third. Perhaps more important are changes in the
geographical distribution of this expenditure (Figure 5).

Multinational companies
Multinational companies are among the largest investors in
R&D (Table 4). Of the 19 that spend more that US$4 billion on
R&D annually, seven are headquartered in the USA (namely,
Microsoft, Pfizer, Ford, General Motors, IBM, Johnson and
Johnson, and Intel, whose total R&D expenditure in 2004
totalled US$45.1 billion), four in Japan, three in Germany, two
in Switzerland and one each in Finland, the Republic of Korea
and the UK. The R&D/net sales ratio for larger multinational
companies tends to be higher than that for smaller (though
still large) companies, replicating the distribution pattern for
US companies. 

US multinationals comprise US parent companies and their
foreign affiliates. Like most multinationals, US multinationals
conduct research in many of the countries in which they do
business. The reasons for this often relate to designing
products and services for local markets or adapting them to

Trends in technology trade
The balance of trade in technology is one measure that has
been receiving substantial attention in recent years. ‘Trade in
technology’ means trade in intellectual property measured
by the payment of royalties and licensing fees. Figure 6
shows the continuing strength of the USA by this measure.
The USA maintains an impressive trade surplus in intellectual
property. Not all of this trade in intellectual property is
‘technology’ in the usual sense of understanding by scientists
and engineers, and the majority of the trade takes place
between affiliated companies. It does, however, provide a
stable and somewhat intellectually defendable marker for
national technological strength over time.

The services sector has grown faster than manufacturing for
at least two decades and is driving economic activity around
the world. The World Bank estimates that services accounted
for 56% of the global economy in 1980 as opposed to 68%
in 2003. Knowledge-intensive services are both high-tech-
oriented and market-oriented. They more than doubled
from 1986 to 2005, from US$4.5 trillion to US$11.5 trillion in
constant dollars, growing at an inflation-adjusted rate of 4.8%,
compared with 2.7% for other services during this period. 

Service-sector R&D has also grown rapidly. Although this
growth is impressive, the manufacturing sector is still more
technologically intensive than the services sector.

An R&D crisis in ‘big pharma’
The large pharmaceutical companies, almost all of which are
multinational, have been among the biggest spenders on
R&D. In response to these large infusions of research funding,
they have in the past produced a steady stream of
‘blockbuster’ drugs. By keeping a stream of new
pharmaceuticals in the pipeline, they have assured investors
of greater profits, in spite of the very large investments
required in clinical trials and other costs incurred in bringing
new products to market.

In recent years, this business plan appears to have ceased
working effectively. The money has continued to pour into

R&D but the new blockbusters have not come out the
other end. This came to a head in early 2009 when the
drug-maker Pfizer laid off 800 researchers. This admission
that results had not kept up with the billions of R&D
dollars being invested sent shivers through the industry
and the wider biomedical research community.

The case of the rising pharmaceutical industry in India
provides an interesting contrast (see page 368). Biocon, a
leading Indian pharmaceutical company headquartered
in Bangalore, has yet to produce a product with its label
for sale anywhere in the world – even in India – although
it may soon market a drug for treating diabetes which
can be administered orally. Rather, the company has
developed critical enzymes that it sells or licenses to
large pharmaceutical concerns. Biocon also arranges, in
India, for clinical trials of new drugs and has received
approval to do so from the US Food and Drug
Administration.

OTHER FUNDERS AND PERFORMERS 

Uncertain times for state funding of university
research 
The approximately US$ 18.0 billion (4.9%) of total US
GERD not generated in 2006 by either industry or the
federal government was accounted for mainly by colleges
and universities from their own funds (US$ 9.9 billion) and
non-profit organizations other than colleges and
universities (US$ 8.1 billion). 

By far the largest fraction of the research funds expended
by colleges and universities from their own funds in 2006
came from either directed grants from state governments
or from general funds allocated from those same sources.
State government budgets suffered considerably because
of the economic downturn starting in December 2007.
Unlike the federal government, many states cannot run

deficits, as they are obliged to balance their budgets from
year to year. One result has been that state support for
education at all levels has been subject to often severe
budget cuts. In the case of state universities, these cuts
involve their research as well as their instructional
budgets. State governments provide negligible support to
private universities. 

States differ considerably in terms of the amount of R&D
performed within their borders by universities, industry
and federal government facilities, including FFRDCs.
Virtually all of these activities are funded by industry or by
the federal government. In 2005, 59% of total US R&D was
performed in 10 of the country’s 50 states. California alone
accounted for approximately one-fifth of all US R&D that
year. Federal R&D accounted for 85% of R&D in New
Mexico, the state in which the two largest FFRDCs in terms
of performance are located: the Los Alamos National
Laboratory and the Sandia National Laboratory. 

Non-profit bodies leaning towards basic and 
applied research
In 2006, non-profit institutions other than universities and
colleges invested approximately US$8.1 billion in R&D, with
virtually the entire amount being devoted to basic and
applied research rather than development. Between 1986
and 2005, R&D funding from the academic and non-profit
sectors grew at an annual rate of almost 6%, greater than
that of either the industrial or federal sectors, although it
declined slightly between 2005 and 2006. 

Non-profit organizations in the USA both fund and
perform research, although typically each such body
emphasizes one or the other of these functions. Non-
profit organizations depend heavily upon endowments,
which contracted considerably with the economic
downturn that became apparent during 2008. This has
obliged non-profit organizations to reduce the level of
their activities for the duration of the crisis.

United States of America

Two examples of non-profit organizations are the Carnegie
Institution and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. 
We shall not dwell on the former, as it has already been
profiled in the UNESCO Science Report 2005. We could say 
a few words about the Howard Hughes Medical Institute,
though. It was founded in 1953 by the aviator and
industrialist of the same name. The institute is
headquartered in Chevy Chase in the State of Maryland
and has an endowment of US$18.7 billion. It typically
commits almost US$700 million per year to biomedical
research through a competitive grants programme.
Currently, its 300 investigators are located in 
64 universities, research institutes, medical schools and
affiliated hospitals. The institute also distributes more 
than US$80 million annually for science education.

TRENDS IN THE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM 

Since the end of the Second World War, US universities
have moved from the periphery of the nation’s research
system to a position at its vital centre. Although, in 2006,
they performed only about 14% of national R&D in dollar
terms, they performed 57% of the country’s basic research.
This function has become increasingly important as
industry has largely abandoned in-house basic research in
favour of more focused, short-term applied R&D offering a
more rapid return on investment (Box 2 and Figure 7).

Between 1995 and 2002, the number of patents granted 
to universities increased substantially, as did the royalty
income derived from licensing those patents. Patents peaked
at just under 3 300 in 2002 before declining to about 2 700 in
2005. However, the median net royalties from university-held
patents grew from approximately US$600 000 in 2002 to
over US$900 000 in 2005. Even though these amounts are
small compared to the total US$47.8 billion in R&D
performed by universities in 2006, these data indicate that an
increasing fraction of university research is potentially
available for exploitation by industry. At the same time,
universities are at least equally important as the source of
new generations of scientists and engineers. Some critics
contend that they may be neglecting their teaching
function in favour of research, particularly in disciplines that
have a reasonable potential for commercial development.

When university–industry research partnerships emerged
during the late 1970s, considerable concern was expressed
that universities could become 'job shops' for industry.

These concerns have not materialized, although a few
lesser universities may have followed this course. Disputes
between universities and industrial partners over the
shares of income derived from their research
collaborations are rare, primarily because contracts
detailing these and other essential matters are negotiated
in advance.

One area where concern does seem to be growing in the
USA, especially among journal publishers, is the risk of a
conflict of interest between scientific researchers and private
industry affecting the results of some research (Box 3).

The essential role of research universities
The bulk of academic research and advanced teaching at
graduate level are carried out by a relatively small number
of US universities. According to the Carnegie Foundation
for the Advancement of Teaching, there are currently
approximately 3 400 degree-granting institutions in the
USA serving approximately 14.5 million students. Among
these, 127 are classified as research universities by the
foundation, defined as being institutions that offer a full
range of baccalaureate and graduate programmes and
obtain more than US$15.5 million annually in federal
grants. Ranked in order of their R&D performance, the 
top 100 US universities account for 80% of all such
expenditure and the top 200 for 96%. 

The impact of the economic recession on universities
In 2006, the total budget for university R&D amounted 
to US$47.8 billion. The federal government financed two-
thirds of this and industry a little less than one-fifth. 
The great majority of university R&D was devoted to 
basic research (Figure 8).

The economic recession has had an impact on all US
institutions of higher education, research universities
included. Private universities depend on income from
their endowments to support both their research and
instructional activities. The value of these endowments,
and therefore the income from them, have decreased
markedly since 2007. For example, the income on
endowments of Harvard and Yale have decreased by
approximately 25%, or approximately US$50 million,
obliging these universities to cut back on their research
and teaching programmes. 

Typically, the research of new faculty members is supported
for up to two years by their universities until they succeed in

UNESCO SCIENCE REPORT 2010

Box 2: Basic research: a cornerstone of US science policy for 65 years 

Support for basic research has been a
cornerstone of US science policy ever
since 1945, when Vannevar Bush
presented his influential report,
entitled Science – the Endless Frontier, to
President Harry Truman. In his report,
Bush argued that the federal
government not only had the
authority but also the obligation to
support research – particularly basic
research – in universities and other
non-profit organizations. 

The importance of federal

investment in basic research has long
ceased to be a politically contentious
issue. Federal investment in basic
research has been supported by both
the Republican and Democratic
presidential administrations for
decades. Both political parties in

Congress have upheld this position, the
only issues in dispute being the level of
support and its distribution among
agencies, programmes and disciplines.
Some disagreements among the two
parties have also arisen over the
appropriateness of federal support for
some pre-competitive R&D in industry.
This disagreement concerns R&D that
lies on the boundary between research
and commercial development,
resulting in what are sometimes called
‘generic or enabling technologies', such
as combustion and corrosion. There are
also serious disagreements about a
proposal to build a space base on the
Moon or to undertake an inhabited
mission to Mars.

Prior to the Second World War, the
federal government provided almost

no support for basic research in
universities and performed little or no
basic research in its own laboratories.
Research in private universities was
supported from their endowments
and by private companies and
philanthropic organizations. Research
in state universities was also supported,
in part, by the governments of their
respective states. Thanks in large
measure to the arguments presented
in Science – the Endless Frontier, this
situation began to change so that, by
1953, the first year in which consistent
data were gathered, the federal
government became – and has
remained ever since – the principal
supporter of basic research (Figure 7).

winning external research grants. But universities can no
longer afford to be quite so generous. Innovative instructional
programmes are also being scaled back, as are funds for
undergraduate scholarships. In the case of state universities,
significant budget reductions have been the order of the day
for their institutions of higher learning, with the effects of
such cutbacks being comparable to the reduced endowment
income of private universities, as state governments struggle
to balance their budgets – unlike the federal government,
state governments must balance their budgets annually. 

Although state universities, like private universities,
support the large majority of their research on federal
grants and, to a lesser extent, on grants from non-profit
organizations, they also depend heavily upon state
government appropriations. State governments
themselves are suffering from a sheer drop in revenue
receipts from unemployed and underemployed residents
who are now paying less income tax than previously.

Some of these austerity measures may be offset by
additional federal funding from the very large federal
economic stimulus programme.

Growing competition for research universities
By several yardsticks, US research universities qualify as
the world’s best in science and engineering, taken
collectively. For example, in 2006, approximately 44% of

the approximately 890 000 S&T articles published in
journals around the world listed by Thomson Reuters,
source of the Science Citation Index (SCI), involved at least
one US author. Of the latter, 74% were from academia. 

US research universities remain the destination of choice
for many foreign graduate students. Since 2003, the
Shanghai Jiao Tong University’s Institute of Higher
Education has ranked the world’s top 500 universities in
terms of the quality of their teaching and research.
American universities have consistently dominated the
upper tier of these annual rankings since they were first
published. Of the top 25 institutions ranked in 2008, 
19 were American. The others were the Universities of
Cambridge (4th), Oxford (10th), Tokyo (19th) and Kyoto (23rd),
as well as the Swiss Federal Institute and Toronto
University, which tied for 24th place.

That a Chinese organization should have decided to carry out
exhaustive periodic surveys to rank the world’s leading
universities may itself suggest that Chinese universities intend
to become internationally competitive. One possible indicator
of this intention is that Tsinghua University in Beijing seems to
have reached its goal of offering 50% of all its graduate
courses in English by 2008. Not only does this reflect the
university’s desire to guarantee that its doctoral recipients are
proficient in English; it also signals Tsinghua’s intention of
attracting significant numbers of foreign students.

UNESCO SCIENCE REPORT 2010

Box 3: Growing concern about conflict of interest in scientific journals

Academic institutions in many
countries have responded to
declining public funding in recent
years by developing research
collaborations with private industry.
This has helped to boost the revenue
of universities and given a more
commercial flavour to academic
research conducted within these
public–private partnerships. 

The publishers of some scientific
and medical journals in the USA are
becoming increasingly concerned,
however, that ‘the conduct of science
can be influenced by biases introduced
by conflicts of interest between
scientific investigators and private
industry’ (Goozner et al., 2009).

‘One consequence of these
proliferating industry–academic
collaborations,’ observes the Associate
Editor-in-Chief of the US journal
Addiction, Thomas Babor of the
University of Connecticut Health
Center, ‘has been the creation of real
as well as apparent conflicts of
interest, particularly in the case of
“dangerous consumption industries,”
such as alcohol, tobacco and
gambling' (Babor, 2009).

‘Conflicts of interest have also been
prominent in cases where financial
interests have compromised patient
care’, he says, such ‘as when the
negative side effects of experimental
drugs become known only after they
have been rushed to market without
appropriate scientific evaluation, or
when the outcomes of positive trials
are published selectively, as with the
selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor
antidepressants in the USA,’ described
by Kirsch et al. (2008).

Even in cases where the author of
a research paper discloses the identity
of his or her sponsor in the journal, this
can be misleading. In one instance, a
scientist writing about her research in
relation to addiction to gambling duly
identified her sponsor as being a
research centre within a respected US
university. It turned out that the centre
was funded by a private foundation
which was itself funded by … casinos
in the country’s gambling capital, the
city of Las Vegas! 

Goozner et al. (2009) propose
model guidelines for scientific and
medical journals to adopt to ensure
the disclosure of conflict of interest

by authors writing in their journals.
They write that ‘organizations are
paying greater attention to conflict of
interest disclosure’ in the context of
redefining the rules of engagement
between academic investigators and
private industry. ‘The need for
common standards in defining
conflicts of interest has never been
greater,’ they add.

According to Babor, the common
standard ‘should apply to the complex
and growing financial arrangements
that have developed in recent years
between vested interests and
independent scientists. ‘It should also
apply to situations where a particular
author has strong non-financial
interests that the reader of his or her
scholarly work should want to know
about in order to judge the meaning
and value of a particular publication.
Finally, the policy should be
consistent across journals in a field
of study in order to prevent some
authors and their sponsors from
gaming the system.’

Source: Babor (2009); Goozner et al. (2009)

Despite their high quality, US research universities face
growing international competition. In 2002, the USA
produced 30.9% of the world’s articles in science and
engineering, authorship being dominated by academia.
This compared with a neat 10.0% for Japan and 84.0% for
all OECD countries. Comparable percentages for 2008
were 27.7%, 7.6% and 76.4%. China exhibited the most
striking increase in its share of the world’s natural science
and engineering articles, rising from 5.2% in 2002 to
10.6% in 2008 (see page 10). 

A growing fragmentation of research universities 
One problem facing US research universities is a
consequence of their phenomenal success. As research
has advanced, it has become increasingly specialized.

Consequently, many university departments whose
faculties conducted research in a number of sub-
specialties have fragmented into independent
departments, each devoted to one of these sub-
specialties. This is perceived by many as being
problematic, since it dilutes the fundamental role of
research universities as institutions for the discovery and
transmission of fundamental knowledge. Moreover, many
universities that were once primarily institutions within a
core college of arts and sciences plus a few professional
schools, such as law and medicine, now include less
‘academic’ schools devoted to what are considered more
‘practical’ curricula such as finance and marketing. While
in itself, this may not be a problem, it has led to further
fragmentation of research universities.

A resistant glass ceiling 
For the past three decades, the National Science Foundation
(NSF) and other federal agencies have mounted major
programmes in concert with professional science and
engineering societies to convince more women and ethnic
minorities to seek careers in science and engineering. 

However, there is indisputable evidence that many of
these talented female and ethnic minority PhDs continue
to encounter the proverbial ‘glass ceiling’ as they attempt
to advance in the conservative, slow-to-change academic
hierarchy (Figures 9 and 10).

A vulnerable university environment
A problem unique to research universities supported by state
governments, as opposed to private universities, is the
dependence of their budgets on the changing whims of state
governors and legislatures. Although leading state
universities derive the bulk of their research budgets from
federal grants, funding from state governments remains the
bedrock of their research and teaching programmes. While
one state governor and state legislature may recognize the
importance of the research and educational offerings of their
university, their successors –faced with budget deficits – may

decide that sharp reductions in university budgets can do
little harm in the short run. They fail to understand that
reconstituting a diminished educational institution takes
many years to accomplish. This problem has become
increasingly apparent during the current economic
recession.

Although many, if not most, individual faculty are
economic and political liberals – at least with the money
of others! –research universities in the USA are
fundamentally conservative institutions. When they do
change, they most often do so slowly and deliberately.
The evolution of American colleges into research
universities proceeded slowly following the American Civil
War (1861–1865). Only during the past 60 years have
those universities flourished and become the core of the
country’s S&T system. Clearly, US research universities
cannot afford to rest on their laurels or assume that the
public understands and appreciates the essential role they
play in the furtherance of society’s fundamental goals.
The quality of the research and teaching provided by East
Asian universities has been rapidly improving in the past
few years. Chinese universities in particular aspire to
compete with universities throughout the world and
above all those in the USA – and could do so with
considerable success.

HUMAN RESOURCES in S&T

Characteristics of the labour force
Estimates of the size of the US science and engineering
(S&E) labour force vary depending on which criteria are
used to define who is a scientist or engineer: education,
occupation, field of degree, field of employment and so
on. In 2006, 17.0 million individuals had at least one
degree in a field of science or engineering, a figure that
climbed to 21.4 million if one added related fields such as
health or technology. 

In 2004, approximately 15 530 individuals reported they
had received a science or engineering degree at the
bachelor’s or higher level during the previous year.
Among these, approximately 5 120 (33%) were
employed directly as engineers or in scientific
occupations, whereas the remainder (approximately
10 400 graduates) were employed in positions not
directly related to science or engineering. Among the
latter, two-thirds said that their positions were at least

50

somewhat related to their degrees, including many in
management, marketing and sales. 

In 2003, 59% of all degree-holders in a scientific field or
engineering were employed in the for-profit sector and
13% by government, with the non-profit sector, four-year
colleges and universities, other educational institutions
and self-employment accounting for the balance. Among
those with doctorates in a scentific field or engineering,
44% were working in four-year colleges and universities,
33% in the for-profit sector and 9% in government.

No sign of a supply crisis in higher education
Figure 11 illustrates the trends in bachelor’s degrees
awarded by US colleges and universities in selected
science and engineering fields over a 20-year period.
Figure 12 shows comparable trends for doctoral degrees
awarded during the same period. 

Although concerns have been voiced for well over a decade
now that too few US undergraduate students are choosing
to specialize in S&T fields, a major ‘supply crisis’ has yet to
materialize. One possible legitimate ground for these
concerns used to be that the university-age cohort in the
US population was steadily declining. However, that trend
has recently reversed. Enrollment in US institutions of
higher education rose from 12.7 million in 1986 to 
16.9 million in 2004. The number of individuals aged
20–24 years in the US population is expected to keep rising
through 2050. However, the demographic composition of
this population is expected to change, with the rise in
enrollment projected to come mainly from minority groups,
particularly Asians and Hispanics. The dual challenge will be
to ensure that the percentage of students who elect to
specialize in S&T fields remains at least constant and that
the education they receive fulfils the employment
requirements for at least the first half of the 21st century. 

Among the 16.9 million students attending US colleges
and universities in 2004, approximately 583 000 (3.5%)
were enrolled in science and engineering programmes,
defined as involving traditional disciplinary or
interdisciplinary studies. The number of bachelor’s and
master’s degrees awarded by US colleges and universities
in science and engineering fields reached new heights in
2005 of approximately 466 000 and 120 000 respectively.
All but computer science experienced increases; however,
in the latter field, the number of bachelor’s degrees had
already increased sharply from 1998 to 2004 before

declining in 2005. The number of doctoral degrees
awarded by US institutions of higher education also
reached a new peak of almost 30 000 in 2005, the strongest
growth being in engineering and in the biological and
agricultural sciences. Virtually all of the growth in
doctorates reflected higher numbers of temporary visa
holders. These students earned 10 800 (36%) of the
doctorates awarded in science and engineering in the
USA in 2005, compared with 5 000 (21%) in 1985. 

Foreign students most numerous in 
PhD programmes
Foreign students on temporary visas earn a larger
proportion of their degrees at the doctoral level than at
any other level. In 2005, students in this category earned

50% or more of all doctoral degrees awarded in the USA 
in mathematics, computer sciences, physics and
engineering. Proportions were considerably lower in other
scientific fields: just 26% in the biological sciences, for
example, and 22% in medical sciences and other life
sciences. Between 1985 and 2005, all but two of the top
10 countries sending doctoral candidates in science and
engineering to the USA were in Asia, with Canada and
Mexico being the two exceptions. During this 20-year
period, students from China, Chinese Taipei, India and the
Republic of Korea earned more than half of all doctorates
in S&T fields awarded in the USA to students from foreign
countries. In 2005, 3500 of these doctorates went to
Chinese nationals, followed by 1 250 Indians and an
approximately equal number of Koreans.

Between 1985 and 2004, the number of doctoral 
degrees awarded by Chinese universities rose from close
to zero to approximately 14 000, compared to the slightly
more than 20 000 awarded in the USA. This means that
China has now become the world’s second-largest
producer of PhDs in science and engineering, followed 
by Germany, the UK, Japan and the Republic of Korea.
This trend reflects the growing quality of graduate
education in China’s universities. Enrollment in
engineering has grown less rapidly than in other fields,
however, reflecting burgeoning opportunities in
business, education and law. In 1994, 46% of bachelor’s
degrees  were in engineering. By 2004, that proportion
had dropped to 37%. 

Foreign enrollment in US graduate schools continues to be
substantial, particularly as concerns Asian students. In 2005,
foreign students who had passed their university entrance
exam for the bachelor’s degree outside the USA accounted

for 60% of all students enrolled in PhD programmes in
engineering at American universities, 38% of those enrolled
in natural sciences and 21% of those enrolled in the
behavioural and social sciences. France and the UK
continue to compete with the USA for foreign students and,
in recent years, Australia and Japan have joined the fray,
with relative success in attracting students from Asia.

Of the approximately 3.4 million immigrant scientists and
engineers now working in the USA, approximately 30%
originally came to study. In 2005, somewhat more than
70% had plans to stay once they completed their degree
and 50% had firm offers of employment. Between 2002
and 2005, more than 90% of Chinese recipients of a US
doctorate in science or engineering reported plans to stay
in the USA and 60% that they had accepted firm offers for
employment or postdoctoral research positions. The
figures for Indian recipients of a US doctorate were similar:
88% and 63%.

CHANGING TOOLS IN R&D
MANAGEMENT 

Deciding on the amount and distribution of R&D funds,
be it in government or industry, is the easy part of
management. Measuring output is much harder but
even that is not as hard as ensuring an adequate
output. To be successful in managing R&D, you need the
right tools and the ability to apply these deftly.

If you are in government, you are going to use very
different R&D management tools from those used in
industrial R&D. Whereas the former seeks a maximum
social return, the latter is looking for a maximum
(mainly short-term) economic return on investment for
stockholders or other owners. Accountability is thus
not the same in government and industry. This is made
more complex by the difficulty in measuring return on
anything other than very short-term development
efforts.

New government tools
The US government has recognized the difficulty in
measuring the effectiveness of government investment
in basic research and both mathematics and science
education. Some years ago, in the midst of efforts to
hold federal agencies more accountable for their
expenditure, the Government Performance and Results
Act of 1993 (GPRA) was enacted. Applying this to basic
research programmes, such as those supported by the
NSF, proved extremely challenging. The result was the
development of a measurement metric quite different
from the usual GPRA approach and the establishment in
2002 of an NSF Advisory Committee for GPRA
Performance Assessment. This committee provides
advice and recommendations to the NSF director
regarding NSF’s performance under the GPRA.

The GPRA as applied to the NSF focuses on
demonstrating significant achievement for four long-
term qualitative and strategic goals. These are: discovery;
learning; research infrastructure; and stewardship.
Admittedly, it is very difficult to quantify progress
towards these broad goals.

The committee’s report of 31 July 2008 commends NSF
for meeting its goals and for implementing some of the
committee’s recommendations from the previous year.
In this review, the committee randomly selected

United States of America

‘highlights’ NSF submitted from its programme which
were evaluated against stated criteria. The bottom line is
that, over time, this evaluative process has been effective
in assessing and improving the quality of the NSF
research portfolio.

New tools for industrial R&D
Industrial R&D marches to a very different drummer. 
As noted above, the time-frame is much more immediate.
This is true for several reasons. For one thing, the discount
rate means that results recognized in the medium to long
term are worth less than short-term results. Another is that
intellectual property is more difficult to define and protect
as one moves further into the future. One characteristic
common to both industrial and government-supported
research is the need for excellent human resources. Good
people are indeed necessary but not a sufficient condition
for success in R&D.

Industrial R&D managers use a variety of tools to
maximize the return on R&D investment. These tools
include recruiting and retaining excellent staff who are
team players, recognizing the importance of intellectual
property and being amenable to rapid changes in order
to meet customer needs and adapt to new technology
platforms and organizational realignments.

Obtaining knowledge required for the development 
of new products and processes is a key objective of
companies. The classic ‘make or buy’ options are now
more complex. 

Knowledge feeds the innovation process. Although 
the best knowledge (technology in many cases) may 
be available, it may not be enough in itself to spur
innovation. Innovation requires vision, acceptance of
new ideas, risk-taking and an understanding of
markets. It often involves teams of scientists, engineers
and marketers and the ability to support networks
within the organization or company that utilizes a
common language understood by scientists and sales
personnel alike.

How have things changed? Charles Larson, president-
emeritus of the Industrial Research Institute, recently
compared effectiveness of industrial R&D now and 
10 years ago. He concluded that things had not
changed as much as expected. Researchers are more
business-oriented today but are not taking more risks.

53

USA chapter [1] [Ed2]:Layout 1  25/11/10  10:28  Page 54

UNESCO SCIENCE REPORT 2010

Technology intelligence, although important, is less so
than projected a decade ago. Information technology
has had less of an impact than expected. Teams are the
norm. Management remains a challenge and the
innovation system is not yet integrated adequately in
many, if not most, companies.

‘Spend wisely’ for R&D effectiveness
A raft of studies over several decades have indicated
that greater R&D spending results in better sales and
profit margins. The market has translated this
indication into higher stock prices for the benefit of
the company’s stockholders. In his 1987 Nobel Prize
Lecture, economist Robert Solow alluded to the
‘growth accounting’ work of the late Edward Denison.
Solow stated that ‘gross output per hour of work in the
US economy doubled between 1909 and 1949; and
some seven-eighths of that increase could be
attributed to “technical change in the broadest
sense”… [I]n the thirty years since then … [t]he main
refinement has been to unpack “technical progress in
the broadest sense” into a number of constituents of
which various human-capital variables and
“technological change in the narrow sense” are the
most important. … 34 % of recorded growth is
credited to “the growth of knowledge” or
“technological progress in the narrow sense”.’

Over the last generation, companies have changed
their approach to R&D. Time horizons have been
shortened. Intellectual property is vigorously
protected. Knowledge needed for innovation is
obtained in the cheapest way possible.

Some analyses in recent years have found little or no
correlation between R&D spending, on the one hand,
and the growth in sales, earnings or shareholder returns
for the company on the other. These results imply that
just putting more money into R&D does not ensure an
economic advantage. These same studies show that
companies which ‘under-spend’ by investing
substantially less in R&D than their competitors do
poorly. The answer to this conundrum appears to be
‘spend wisely’. This means using all R&D management
tools available in the toolbox and using them cleverly.
This is a tall order. Companies, at least before the
current recession, tended to ignore these correlations
and were tempted merely to accelerate their spending
on R&D in an effort to become more competitive.

54

INTERNATIONAL SCIENTIFIC 
CO-OPERATION – AND COMPETITION 

On a global scale, we are seeing both growing 
co-operation and competition in R&D. This holds true for
industry but also for academia and government research
installations. The importance of international co-operation
for science throughout the world was emphasized at the
Fourth World Science Forum in Budapest, Hungary, on 
10 November 2009, also World Science Day.

International co-authorship
International co-operation has long been regarded as an
essential aspect of non-proprietary research, particularly
when it comes to basic research. The rise of the Internet
has galvanized co-operation in cross-border academic
research, especially that between individual investigators
and their institutions. In 2005, approximately 27% of SCI
papers published by scientists and engineers working in
US institutions had at least one co-author from a non-US
institution, compared with approximately 17% in 1995.
This varied among scientific disciplines. For example, in
astronomy, 58% of all US papers had foreign co-authors in
2005, compared with 42% in 1995; the share of 
co-authored papers in physics was 38% in 2005, up from
28% in 1995, whereas 33% of those in the geosciences
were co-authored in 2005, up from 28% in 1995. 

Trends in co-operation in small science and
megascience
The past decade has seen an atrophy of formal,
government-to-government research co-operation
protocols and an increase in projects between individuals.
Today, the role of governments in small science is to
provide a policy framework that encourages such 
co-operation, including the provision of financial support.
The Internet has served as an enabler of this dispersed 
co-operation. Without the speed and ease of
communication and the virtually unlimited data available
on the web, co-operation in small science would be a
much more modest affair. This burgeoning collaboration is
reflected in the scientific literature. 

Megascience projects predominantly concern basic
research involving very expensive central facilities or
large, distributed research programmes spread over many
geographical locations. Megascience projects are often
too costly for any one country to fund and execute.

United States of America

They need greater involvement by governments and the
institutions of organized science. The USA took the lead in
establishing the OECD Megascience Forum in 1992, now
the OECD Global Science Forum. 

Like Japan, the USA also supports the European-led Large
Hadron Collider (LHC) at the European Organization for
Nuclear Research (CERN) in Geneva, Switzerland, where
collisions between protons and anti-protons at higher
energies than ever achieved before will permit the recreation
of conditions prevailing in the early Universe. After the LHC
came through its first operational tests with flying colours in
September 2008, it was anticipated that experiments could
begin by mid-2009. However, an unfortunate malfunction of
one of its critical elements threatened to delay this promising
début. The LHC was repaired, however, and restarted in
November 2009.

The USA is also a participant in the International
Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) now under
construction in the south of France (see page 158). ITER is
the largest, most ambitious international collaborative
scientific project ever conceived and implemented.
Unfortunately, due to inaction by Congress, the USA was
unable to meet its commitment to the project in 2008.
Whereas many other countries make multi-year
commitments to co-operative projects, US commitments
are often held hostage to the country’s annual budget
process. This shortcoming in the US policy framework is
long-standing and may be insoluble.

Research alliances, outsourcing and offshoring
Industrial R&D continues its drive for greater efficiency. This
means quicker results that are closer-coupled to business
strategy. Hundreds of new alliances in technology or research
are formed each year by companies in areas such as
information technology (IT), biotechnology, advanced
materials and automotive technology. Not surprisingly, the
majority of such alliances involve companies headquartered
in the USA, Western Europe and Japan. It is not uncommon
for companies to co-operate closely in developing
technology  in one line of business or in one geographical
market, while competing fiercely with another. The common
goal is to develop technology-intensive products at minimum
cost while preserving a market advantage wherever possible.

Alliances, partnerships and outsourcing have become
more common with other companies, offshore R&D
centres, federal laboratories and universities.

These partnerships are not limited to peers; they
increasingly involve customers, to ensure the products
developed are what customers want. Accessing, co-
ordinating and moving this knowledge results in
investments in IT. 

Perhaps the strongest trend in R&D management
relates to ‘open innovation’. ‘Open innovation’ has come
to encompass all sorts of outsourcing and co-operative
activities with government laboratories, universities and
other companies. Progress is being made thanks to
smarter R&D strategies but the target continues to be
elusive in the face of relentless global competition.

Open innovation means that companies have evolved
from a stance of ‘making’ the technology they use to
‘buying’ large portions of it. Shorter product cycles
dictated by changing markets demand that innovations
adhere to shorter timelines. The results of these changes
have dramatically impacted the ways companies obtain
technology. These changes include more outsourcing of
R&D, licensing technology from other companies and
universities, greater use of consortia and alliances for
pre-competitive and other research, outsourcing
fundamental research to universities and contracts with
federal laboratories. These trends reflect attempts to
invest innovation resources in a smarter way.

In part because S&T is correctly perceived to be a
significant prerequisite for socio-economic
development, competition among companies
headquartered in different countries has become
intense. Many US-based companies have moved critical
components of their operations to other countries
where trained human resources can be obtained more
cheaply. This has created considerable controversy in
the USA because of the implications for employment.

However, companies also recognize that, in order to
succeed, they need to become integral to what
Auerswald and Branscomb (2008) have referred to as the
‘globally networked enterprise’ in an article published in
Technology in Society. To this end, companies in several
industries, most prominently IT and pharmaceuticals, have
established R&D centres in several countries. The most
prominent of these – located primarily in China and India –
do more than simply conduct R&D to adapt companies’
products to local markets. Rather, their R&D aims to
develop new products that can be marketed worldwide.

UNESCO SCIENCE REPORT 2010

ComparingS&T quality and quantity internationally
Earlier sections of the present chapter referred to
international comparisons of the quantity and quality of
R&D and R&D institutions. Here, we shall summarize some
of these rankings:

I The USA has invested more in GERD than all the other G7
countries combined for more than a decade. In 2006, its
share of all such G7 expenditure was 53% of the total.

I For several years, the US GERD/GDP ratio among the

G7 countries has been second only to Japan’s. In 2007,
the respective ratios for Japan, the USA, Germany,
France and the UK were 3.4%, 2.7% 2.5%, 2.0% and
1.8%.

I The European Union is the favoured destination for

R&D shares by foreign affiliates of multinational
corporations, accounting for 66% in 2006, well ahead
of Canada (10%) and Japan (6%).

I The US trade volume in intellectual property is by far
the world’s largest, accounting for 70% of the world
total in 2006.

I The number of triadic patent applications3 filed by

inventors in the USA in 2003 acounted for
approximately 37% of all 54 000 triadic patents filed in
that year, up from 35% in 2000. In 2003, inventors in
the European Union filed 28% of such applications,
down from 30% in 2000. Asian (primarily Chinese –
including Taiwanese – Indian and South Korean)
inventors filed 28% of all triadic patent applications in
2003, about the same percentage as in 2000.

I In 2005, the percentage of SCI publications with at

least one author from an American institution
exceeded that of the European Union. The USA
accounted for 27% of the total, compared with 26% for
the European Union. The share of publications with at
at least one Asian author increased from 16% in 1995
to 19% in 2005.

I According to the annual surveys conducted by

Shanghai Jiao Tong University, in 2008, 19 of the top-
ranked 25 universities were American (see page 47).

3. Triadic applications refers to applications to the patent offices of the
USA, European Union and Japan.

56

I In 2004, the USA ranked fourth in terms of its

expenditure on basic research as a fraction of GDP:
0.48%. The USA was preceded by Switzerland (0.84%),
Israel (0.76%) and France (0.52%). Denmark (0.46%) and
the Republic of Korea (0.44%) ranked fifth and sixth
respectively. The highest ranking G7 country in
addition to the USA and France was Japan, which
ranked eleventh at 0.36%.

SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY AND THE
PUBLIC

A stronginterest in scienceamongthe
general public
Periodic surveys commissioned by the National Science
Foundation for almost 30 years indicate strong and
consistent public support for scientific research. For example,
70% of the approximately 2 000 respondents to surveys in
2001 and 2006 agreed that the benefits of scientific research
outweighed harmful results; approximately 80% of those
surveyed during both years agreed that the government
should fund basic research. In 2006, approximately 60% of
those surveyed said that they had visited an informal science
institution, such as a museum or a zoo, during the past year,
a proportion that has remained roughly constant since 1979.
According to data published in Science and Engineering
Indicators 2008, public interest in S&T elsewhere in the world,
including Europe and Japan (but excluding China), is lower
than in the USA.

Although the US public is largely supportive of scientific
research, it generally has relatively poor factual
knowledge about science. In the surveys conducted in
2001 and 2006, the mean of the correct answers to
12 factual questions was approximately 6.5. Factual
knowledge is positively related to the level of formal
schooling, income and the number of courses taken in
science and mathematics in tertiary education. People
who score well on survey questions that test for
information typically learned at school also appear to
know more about nanotechnology and the Earth’s polar
regions, topics that have not been central to the content
of science education in the USA.

Surveys indicate that a reasonable fraction of respondents
do pay attention to, and form definitive attitudes towards,

deal’ of worry about ‘the quality of the environment’ rose
from 35% to 43%. While there is strong positive support
for research in general, attitudes towards some specific
applications are more problematic. In 2005, two-thirds of
Americans said that they supported ‘the use of products
and processes that involve biotechnology’. Similarly, when
surveys ask about medical technologies that are to be
derived from stem cell research in the context of
anticipated health benefits, public response is relatively
positive. But technologies that involve cloning human
embryos elicit strong negative responses. 

Confidence in scientists
Despite the fact that only a small minority of the US public
believes it is well-informed about S&T and despite misgivings
about specific research applications, public confidence in the
leadership of the scientific community, including in
medicine, was second only to its confidence in the military in
2006 and considerably greater than its confidence in other
institutions, such as organized labour, major companies and
the executive and legislative branches of the US government.
The only institution whose leadership approached the level
of public confidence enjoyed by science and medicine was
the US Supreme Court.

CONCLUSION

A cloudy future
The future of R&D in the USA is cloudy, more so than in
decades. This is in no small part due to the global economic
recession now upon us. Industrial research and research
supported by states and endowed funds are likely to take a
substantial hit, at least in the short term. They are closely
coupled to the economy and financial markets, both of
which were in a downward spiral in 2009. State universities
are especially vulnerable to cutbacks, which were already
being felt in a majority of the states in 2009.

For the short term, it appears that R&D in the USA
functions like some of the toxic assets so often mentioned
as a root cause of the economic crisis: future valuations
are murky. Any increase in federal funding over the short
term, for reasons noted below, will probably be offset by
decreases in funding by states, foundations and industry,
all deeply wounded by the economic recession. 

The 2009 Global R&D Funding Forecast from Battelle and
R&D Magazine was issued in December 2008. The economic

recession was well-recognized by that time, although it
rapidly worsened in 2009. This forecast, which uses a
variety of data sources, acknowledges the uncertain
economic climate, including slower sales and lower
earnings. In spite of this dark cloud, the forecast is for
about 2% growth in US GERD (PPP) in 2009. Given the
deflationary pressures worldwide, this would probably
translate into 2% or more real growth. We shall see if this 
is the real outcome.

As time goes by, the popularity of new and tested
management tools in both the public and private sectors
will increase. In industry ‘open innovation’ strategies appear
to be growing more widespread. ‘Better management’
appears to have broad support both in industry and in
government. This is likely to be enhanced by the
government’s deepening role in innovation, including its
more direct funding of ‘generic or enabling technologies’.

Whether these changes and the economic downturn
generally will substantially shift the balance between
public sector and private sector support of R&D remains
to be seen. Federal support of R&D may actually increase
in the short term as part of funding for an economic
stimulus package. Certainly, in the short term, the
balance seems likely to shift towards the public sector in
general and the federal government in particular. The
longer the economic recession lasts, the more likely this
will be the case.

The Obama administration’s plans for stimulating the
economy include billions of dollars for S&T. This American
Recovery and Reinvestment initiative includes both
short-term economic stimuli to jump-start the economy
and a longer-term component that aims to lay the
groundwork for transforming the economy in the 21st
century. Within an overall programme that approaches
one trillion dollars, Transforming our Economy with Science
and Technology aims to ‘put scientists to work looking for
the next great discovery, creating jobs in cutting-edge
technologies and making smart investments that will
help businesses in every community succeed in a global
economy’.

The extent to which Congress – and the nation as a
whole – will accept President Obama’s vision of the
future, particularly during the most severe economic
recession in 70 years, remains to be seen. The future is
both unfathomable and incredibly challenging.

William A. Blanpied was a staff member at the
National Science Foundation (NSF) in the USA from
1976 until his retirement in January 2003. From 1999
to 2002, he was Director of the NSF’s Tokyo Regional
Office. Following his retirement, he was appointed
Visiting Senior Research Scholar in the Science and
Trade Policy Program at George Mason University in
Arlington, USA. He retired from that position at the
end of 2008.

Dr Blanpied received his PhD in Physics from
Princeton University in 1959. He is a fellow of the
American Physical Society and the American
Association for the Advancement of Science. He is 
the author or co-author of four books, as well as
numerous articles in peer reviewed, professional
journals. 

In April 2003, he was designated as an International
Affiliated Fellow of the National Institute for Science
and Technology Policy. In the fourth quarter of the
same year, he served as a guest lecturer in the School
of Policy and Management at Tsinghua University in
Beijing.

J. Thomas Ratchford (Tom) is principal at Science,
Trade and Technology Associates (STTA) – a
consulting firm that provides analytic, business and
advisory services for domestic and foreign corporate,
educational and not-for-profit clients. He recently
retired from a position as Distinguished Visiting
Professor at the George Mason University Law School
in the Washington, DC area, where he had directed
the Program on Science and Trade Policy.

Dr Ratchford was born in the state of South Carolina
in 1935. By education a condensed matter physicist,
he began his career as a professor of physics. He was
sidetracked into policy in the late 1960s as a
Congressional Fellow of the American Political
Science Association. In the 1970s, he was one of the
first scientists to serve the Congress full time. In the
late 1980s and early 1990s, he was Associate Director
for Policy and International Affairs at the White House
Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP). Prior
to his confirmation by the US Senate to his OSTP
position in 1989, he was the Associate Executive
Officer of the American Association for the
Advancement of Science.

Dr Ratchford has published extensively on both
science for policy and policy for science, with
emphasis in recent years on Asia, especially China
and India. He has co-authored all the chapters on the
USA in the UNESCO Science Report since the series
began in 1993.

INTRODUCTION

The present chapter describes the evolution over the 
past decade of the science and innovation systems of
Canada, a northern nation that has traditionally relied 
on its natural resources and geography for socio-economic
progress. We shall examine what Canada has done to
mobilize the international currency of knowledge and 
skills for competitive advantage while managing its more
conventional assets in a sustainable and responsible
manner. We shall also point to some longstanding
structural characteristics of the economy that have
contributed to the continued poor performance of
industrial research and development (R&D) and innovation.
By default, the public research sector – and institutions of
higher education in particular – has largely come to be seen
by policy-makers as a surrogate for innovation.

Canada is unquestionably a major player in global science,
with considerable assets. We shall describe some of the
more recent experiments that have made Canada one of
the world’s premier science and research players. We shall
also underscore the current challenges Canada faces in

overcoming the principle weaknesses in its approach to
innovation. This comes at a time when the world is faced
with a severe economic recession. Canada has not been
spared but has perhaps been affected to a lesser extent
than other countries. Thanks to its comparative strengths
– a banking system among the strongest in the world and
a real estate market that has avoided the excesses seen in
other countries – a more rapid recovery is predicted.
Furthermore, core inflation is at its lowest point in over 
50 years and commodity income from the country’s
considerable natural resources has helped to mitigate the
negative impact on the economy. As in other countries,
unemployment has risen – it stood at 7.9% nationally as of
June 2010. In recent years, real GDP has grown (Figure 1),
from CAN$1.091 trillion in 2004 to CAN$1.226 trillion in
2008, with GDP per capita currently at approximately
CAN$46 000 per annum. A two-year stimulus package of
CAN$62 billion to 2010/2011 is in place, representing
about 4.2% of GDP, with a deficit projected by the federal
government at around CAN$50.2 billion in 2009/2010.1

1.  In July 2009, the Bank of Canada declared that Canada was on the path
to recovery from recession.

UNESCO SCIENCE REPORT 2010

Canada is a G8 economy (Figure 2) with a population of
34 million in a North American integrated economy. 
An officially French and English bilingual nation, it has an
ageing but highly educated and multi-ethnic population.
Canada covers a huge land mass – second only to the
Russian Federation in size – and is exposed to extreme
climates, straddling as it does the Arctic Circle. Its vast
territory is well connected by sophisticated information
and communication technology (ICT) networks. Also of
note is that Canada has no constitutionally defined
division of labour in relation to science and technology
(S&T), being a federated state which practices power-
sharing among the central government, the ten provinces
and three territories that make up its political landscape.

Canada has a number of structural and cultural
characteristics that mark its approach to science and
innovation. In recent years, basic questions have
emerged as a result of the federal Science and Technology
Strategy released by the minority Conservative Party
government in May 2007 (Government of Canada, 2007).
The strategy’s four principles are: promoting world-class
excellence, focusing on priorities, fostering partnerships
and enhancing accountability. For example, are priority
areas sufficiently focused on future investments? If
Canada wants to compete, how should it do so and on
what basis? How does one assess impact? And what roles
do skills, education, talent and ingenuity play in all of
this? As the central government possesses no Ministry 
of Education and no full-time, dedicated Cabinet-level
Minister for Science,2 these are indeed critical questions
of national importance, particularly in the context of 
the current economic recession, major industrial
restructuring and significant new investments in S&T 
and innovation by the US administration (see page 36). 
As a result, a national debate has resurfaced on the
potential loss of Canada’s brain power to its neighbour to
the south and on Canada’s future global competitiveness.
Furthermore, a recent report by the government’s
Science, Technology and Innovation Council (STIC) has
noted that, while Canada is a relatively solid performer in
STI, it needs to aim for a bigger role on the world stage.
As the report puts it, ‘while we have been good, we now
need to be great’ (STIC, 2009).

2.  In September 2008, the Conservative government appointed a
Minister of State for Science and Technology reporting to the Minister of
Industry, the first such position since 1990. With this latest appointment,
Canada has had 23 elected politicians with some titled responsibility for
S&T since 1971.

TRENDS IN INNOVATION

The end of a long investment cycle?
Several observers have noted that a country like Canada,
situated immediately to the north of the world’s largest
knowledge superpower, cannot afford to remain
complacent about its own approach to innovation. Over
the dozen years since 1997, federal and provincial
governments have invested a combined amount of well
over CAN$20 billion in R&D (Table 1), much of it in the
academic and medical research sectors but increasingly in
specific targeted areas where Canada and its regions have
a competitive advantage. These areas, notionally defined
by the current federal S&T strategy, include natural
resources and energy, environmental science and
technologies, health and related life sciences and ICTs.
Canada is also a global player in such disciplinary fields as
astronomy and space science, clinical medicine and
genomics, Earth sciences and mathematics (CCA, 2006).
Between 2002 and 2008, the number of Canadian
publications inventoried in the Science Citation Index rose
from 30 305 to 43 539, an increase spread evenly across all
major fields of science (Figure 3). 

In terms of overall refereed journal publications, Canada
ranks sixth in the world (Figure 4). Some 60% of Canadian
scientific papers are co-authored with the country’s
largest scientific partners, the United Kingdom and USA
(Science-Metrix, 2008) [Table 2].

In part, this large-scale, long-term investment cycle in R&D
since 1997 has come about through continuous budget
surpluses over the decade leading up to the recession in
2008. As a result, Canada has been at the forefront of the
G8 in terms of gross domestic expenditure on research
and development (GERD) per capita in the higher
education sector and is second only to Sweden among
countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development (OECD) in this category. R&D in the
higher education sector now constitutes roughly 35% of
the country’s total R&D performance (Figure 5).

However, other data cloud this rosy picture. Business R&D
expenditure in Canada as a percentage of GDP declined
by 20% from 2001 to 2007. Canadian industry’s spending
on R&D was just over 1% of GDP in 2006, well below the
OECD average of 1.56% and the US average of 1.84%.
Business R&D represents only about 54% of R&D
performed in the country and is concentrated in a handful
of companies, with only 19 firms spending more than
CAN$100 million per year on R&D (Figure 6). The top ten
companies have carried out one-third of all R&D over the
past two decades (OECD, 2008). Even more troubling, one
firm, Nortel, responsible for a large portion of this one-
third of business R&D, has been severely weakened by its
inability to recover from the high-tech market crash in
2000–2001 and, more recently, from the global recession.
In January 2009, facing flagging market demand, Nortel
filed for bankruptcy protection, leading to most of its key
assets being gradually sold off. Business R&D spending in
the manufacturing sector especially appears to be in slow

There are other worrying signs. The labour market
demand for science and engineering graduate students
appears to be weakening. Since 1984, relative labour
productivity in Canada’s business sector has fallen from
more than 90% of the US level to about 76% in 2007.
Canada ranked 15th out of 18 countries in a recent
assessment of growth in labour productivity. When
compared to the USA, Canada has shown much slower
growth in labour productivity since 2000 in three major
sectors: manufacturing; information and culture; and
finance, insurance and real estate. The average
investment per worker in ICTs in Canada was only about
60% of the US level in 2007. In short, some have
concluded that Canadian business – with a few notable
exceptions – tends to be seen as a technology follower,
not a leader.

Government investment choices
Historically, government investment in S&T has been
largely a non-partisan issue. All political parties support it
but to varying degrees and with a different emphasis from
one period to another. For example, once it had absorbed
a serious budgetary deficit, Canada’s previous Liberal
Party administration (1993–2005) decided from 1997
onwards to invest in knowledge on a large scale relative to
other discretionary expenditure, reasoning that fostering
a sound knowledge economy would greatly benefit
Canadians.

UNESCO SCIENCE REPORT 2010

To some extent, this investment has paid off but it has also
raised expectations of continued funding on a similar scale.
The current government has also supported new R&D
investment under its federal Science and Technology Strategy
released in May 2007. However, it has been criticized in the
media as well as in some research circles for an
overemphasis on investment in scientific infrastructure at
the expense of more significant renewed programme
funding for the three main grants councils – the Natural
Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC); the
Canadian Institutes of Health Research; and the Social
Sciences and Humanities Research Council – and other
research funding institutions like Genome Canada. 
In the face of the ambitious research funding and aggressive
science and education policy agenda announced by the
Obama administration, some fear a loss of talent and
research expertise to a re-energized US research system.

Over the past decade, a number of new science and
innovation programmes and institutional projects have

been successfully introduced into the research system.
These include the 2000 Canada Research Chairs, the
Networks of Centres of Excellence, the Canada Foundation
for Innovation, Genome Canada and numerous
scholarship programmes. These have been accompanied
by funding increases for the three major grants councils
for university research and by provisions for indirect
research costs. In all, an estimated CAN$16 billion in new
federal research funding has pushed Canada to the
forefront of the international S&T arena but has also
resulted in calls for greater accountability and for the
socio-economic impact of S&T projects to be
demonstrated.

A persistently poor R&D culture in much of the
business sector
Focusing on supply issues is a constant reminder that
demand for knowledge must also be well grounded. 
In Canada, this continues to be problematic. The debate
over Canada’s weak business R&D is perennial, going back

to the early 1960s (Dufour and de la Mothe, 1992). Whereas,
in most leading developed economies, the private sector
plays an active role in driving and championing the need
for an enhanced innovative capability, in Canada, business
leadership is largely lacking. In part, this is because many
Canadian-based firms are weak performers of R&D. This is to
some extent a function of their status as branches or plants
of foreign-based multinationals but it can also be attributed
to the fact that Canada has been a global commodity
producer, an area where R&D has not been considered a
major business input.3

A 2009 study by the Council of Canadian Academies has
argued that there is no single cause for weak innovation in
Canada. Rather, a sound understanding and analysis of
the factors that influence business decision-makers, sector
by sector, is also required (CCA, 2009a). It has made the
point rather convincingly that Canada’s productivity
problem is actually a business innovation problem and
that business strategies do not emphasize innovation as a
key competitive tool. Canada’s place in ‘upstream’ North
American industries and a small domestic market that is

geographically fragmented provide less incentive for a
business to innovate in order to survive. Others also argue
that there is insufficient advocacy from the various private
sector associations to invest in innovation and devote
greater attention to the importance of innovation and
research for competitiveness.

Jump-starting the innovation process
Arguably then, the higher education research sector has
come to be seen as a surrogate for industrial R&D in
Canada, along with some key public technology
institutions. There have been numerous attempts by
successive governments at both the federal and provincial
levels to shape new public sector levers to stimulate the
commercialization of knowledge through public–private
partnerships. One good example of this is the agreement
negotiated by the federal government with the
Association of Canadian Universities and Colleges (AUCC)

3.  It should be noted, however, that multinational firms operating in
Canada appear to invest more in R&D than their Canadian-owned
counterparts.

in 2002; it stipulated that Canadian universities were to
double the amount of research they performed and triple
their commercialization performance, in addition to
intensifying the training of graduate researchers and
contributing to the socio-economic development of their
communities. As a result of this entente, the AUCC has
produced various accountability measures and
benchmarks to monitor and update these commitments.
For example, according to its data, the income received by
Canadian universities from the commercialization of
research results almost doubled between 2002 and 2006,
while spin-offs from universities grew from 718 in 1999 to
1068 in 2006 (AUCC, 2008).

Another novel case can be found with the Networks of
Centres of Excellence (NCE) programme mentioned
earlier. A competitive-based initiative, the programme was
launched in 1989 with the objective of not only
developing a network of excellence around the country to
address specific research challenges but also of working in
concert with industry to generate practical applications

from basic research programmes. There are now 20 NCEs,
all chosen via a competitive process covering a gamut of
strategic research areas across the country. They include
three devoted explicitly to major social issues. By all
accounts, the programme has met with considerable
success. For example, according to a recent progress
report on the federal S&T Strategy (Government of
Canada, 2009) in 2006–2007, the NCEs have:

I partnered with close to 2 000 companies, government
departments and agencies, hospitals, universities and
other organizations in Canada and around the world;

I employed more than 6 000 researchers and highly

qualified personnel;

I supported their scientists in filing 110 patents and

publishing 4 309 papers in refereed journals;

I obtained or launched negotiations on 20 licenses and

generated four spin-off companies.

Building on this model, the federal government has
experimented with hybrid, more commercially driven

66

Canada

The three grants councils have also been responsive. For
example, the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research
Council has funded three strategic networks to focus on
challenges in manufacturing, forestry and fisheries. Some
of the provinces have also invested significantly in
research and innovation. The province of Ontario has
created a Ministry of Research and Innovation to focus the
provincial government’s commitment to making
innovation the driving force of Ontario’s economy. Alberta
has announced a major initiative on clean energy and
supports a four-part technology commercialization action
plan. As for Quebec, it has introduced an ambitious
CAN$1.16 billion science and research strategy that
includes funding for participation in key international S&T
ventures.

Despite all of these efforts to improve the demand for
knowledge, including some new funds to foster industrial
R&D internships for students wishing to work in the
private sector, the overall weakness in private sector
performance persists.

designs to engage industry actively. In 2007, the 
Business-Led Networks of Centres of Excellence
programme was announced to fund large-scale
collaborative networks. These are expected to increase
private-sector investment in research in Canada, support
the training of skilled researchers and shorten the time-
lines between research and commercialization. Up to five
centres are to be supported for four years through this
new programme. Centres of Excellence in Commercialization
and Research have also been created to the tune of
CAN$350 million over five years. These advance research
and commercialization of technologies, products and
services in four priority areas identified by the 2007
federal Science and Technology Strategy. The first batch of
these centres was simply announced by the federal
government in 2007 but, since then, centres have
undergone a selection process combining international
peer review with advice from the private sector.

There have been other efforts to jumpstart the innovation
process in Canada. These range from some of the most
generous R&D tax credits in the world to new forms of
venture capital support and even targeted research funds
for automotive innovation, aerospace, forestry and
defence – important employment sectors of the Canadian
economy. In addition, given Canada’s tremendous scope
in energy assets, investments have been made in energy
research and technology, including the establishment of
Sustainable Development Technology Canada in 2001, a
foundation that supports groundbreaking technologies
from the private sector in climate change, clean water 
and next-generation renewable fuels. Along with a 
Clean Energy Fund announced in 2009, more than
CAN$3.5 billion has been invested in energy research 
and technology, with more likely to come.

The National Research Council of Canada, the premier
technology motor of the public sector (with laboratories
across the country), has also increased its financial support
– to CAN$200 million for two years – for the well-
established Industrial Research Assistance Program
designed to help solve the innovation challenges of small
and medium-sized companies. As of October 2009, this
new funding had reached over 1 200 firms and created over
4 500 jobs on top of the 455 new graduates hired by small
firms. In parallel, federal government laboratories in various
areas that include natural resources, national defence, the
environment, and agri-food and agriculture have
developed initiatives to commercialize their technologies.

PERSONNEL ISSUES
The need for a strong national agenda in higher
education and research
In many respects, Canada has two Achilles Heels. The first, as
we have seen, is the lacunae of aggressive private-sector
commitment to innovation. The second is the lack of a strong
national agenda for talent and science education when it
comes to orchestrating effective skills, education and training
for the 21st century. While education remains almost
exclusively a provincial matter, responsibility for S&T and
research are undefined constitutionally. As a result, different
levels of government intercede with different instruments for
varying outcomes. This makes for a complex web of actors
and recipients, often with unco-ordinated leadership. 
A landmark study in 1984 by the defunct Science Council of
Canada on science education involving all jurisdictions made
this point clearly (Science Council of Canada, 1984). Other
studies have since pointed out the need for a pan-Canadian
vision for education, research and skills. Furthermore, despite
the occasional federal/provincial/ territorial S&T ministerial
meetings, Canada’s one and only attempt at a truely national
S&T strategy, adopted by all levels of government in 1987,
has long since lapsed.

Data show that enrollment in Canadian universities in the
2006/2007 academic year rose only 0.9%, the smallest rate
since 2000. Of some concern is a persistent disaffection
among students for the natural sciences and
mathematics: in recent years, enrollment has fallen in
several areas, including mathematics and computer and
information sciences (Figure 7).

However, it is worth noting that Canadian secondary
school pupils perform well in science, according to the
OECD’s Programme for International Student Assessment.
In 2006, they ranked third – after pupils in Finland and
Hong Kong in China.

Taking full advantage of a highly educated foreign-
born population
Nearly half (47%) of Canada’s population of working age
holds a tertiary degree. Canada’s large foreign-born
population is also highly educated. The country has the
highest ratio in the world of foreign-born PhDs to native
PhDs and is second only to the USA for highly skilled
foreign-born workers. Taking full advantage of the
immigrant population for enhanced socio-economic
development is a challenge.

68

Evidence shows that Canada succeeds in attracting highly
skilled immigrants on a permanent basis but fares less well
when it comes to attracting and retaining foreign students at
advanced levels of education. In fact, one of the earlier policy
experiments was structured precisely to address this question
of retention: the CAN$2 billion Canada Research Chairs (CRC)
Programme was designed in 2000 to attract top talent to
Canada’s universities and keep them there. Two thousand
CRCs have been allocated on a competitive basis to 
70 participating universities across the country. The chairs are
allocated according to a two-tier principle: CAN$200 000 per
chair for established ‘stars’ for seven years, tenure that is
renewable, and CAN$100 000 per year for five years for junior
or rising stars. One of the features of this ongoing programme
is that universities have to provide a strategic research plan on
how they would allocate the chairs and in what areas. This
requirement has encouraged Canadian universities to
become more focused in some of their research. The success
of this model has been adapted elsewhere around the globe
and, in 2007, the International Development Research Centre,
Canada’s premier research development agency, joined up
with the CRC programme to create a new initiative for
selected university chairs in the developing world. In 2009,
under this programme, eight research teams were selected to
receive up to CAN$1 million each over five years, each to
address a key development challenge.

Other measures have been put in place under the 2007
federal Science and Technology Strategy. The Vanier Canada
Graduate Scholarships Program supports 500 Canadian
and international doctoral students each year with three-
year scholarships valued at up to CAN$50,000 per annum.
Launched in September 2008, these awards are expected
to attract and support world-class doctoral students who
demonstrate a high standard of scholarly achievement in
graduate studies along with strong leadership skills.

Building on the CRC programme, a Canada Excellence
Research Chairs Program was launched in 2009, with a
budget of CAN$10 million over seven years to support 
20 researchers and their teams in establishing research
programmes at Canadian universities and research hospitals.

Provincial governments promoting an
entrepreneurial culture
Provincial governments are active as well. Quebec has the
highest provincial GERD/GDP ratio in Canada, at 2.7%. It is
followed by Ontario at 2.3%. These two provinces, which
contain most of Canada’s manufacturing heartland,

dominate the provincial R&D landscape. Firms in Ontario
account for 48% of total industrial spending in R&D, while
those in Quebec account for 30% (Statistics Canada, 2009).
For example, the Ontario government’s CAN$3 billion
Innovation Agenda (Government of Ontario, 2008) provides
funding for the development and teaching of commercial
skills across sectors and disciplines. It supports programmes
to spark the interest of young people in innovation. As well
as providing funding for theoretical physics and quantum
computing, Ontario invested CAN$100 million in an
initiative centred on genomics research in 2009, along with
a CAN$250 million Emerging Technologies Fund to be co-
invested with venture capital funds-for companies in clean
technology, life sciences and digital media and ICTs. 

Other provinces, such as Alberta, Quebec, British Columbia
and Saskatchewan, are all actively engaged in promoting
science and an entrepreneurial culture through science
popularization, outreach and scholarships. Most provinces
have embedded science and research functions in
ministries responsible for small business, entrepreneurship
or innovation. A few have S&T councils advising their
government on emerging trends and new policy directions,
among them British Columbia and Quebec. Alberta has

adopted a new approach to innovation with the creation of
Alberta Innovates, a set of four corporations that will
address specific innovation challenges for the province.

Several provinces have research and technology councils
that develop technology commercialization and cluster
strategies to enhance innovation specific to their region,
often in conjunction with federally funded research
bodies located in their province or territory. Some of the
regional agencies for economic development supported
by the federal government are active in this arena. 
One example is the multimillion-dollar Atlantic Innovation
Fund established in 2000, which supports research in the
four Atlantic provinces: Nova Scotia, New Brunswick,
Prince Edward Island, and Newfoundland and Labrador.

INVESTMENT IN INFRASTRUCTURE

Laying the foundations for innovation
Funding is a good start but researchers also need a well-
appointed home if they are to be successful. In 1997, the
federal government initiated an experiment that it
dubbed the Canada Foundation for Innovation (CFI).

Despite its name, the programme is actually designed to
ensure the provision of state-of-the-art research capacity,
equipment and facilities to universities, colleges and
hospitals across Canada. Envisioned to last for five years,
with an initial investment of CAN$800 million, its success
has been such that its lifespan will carry it beyond 2010 –
with a combined projected investment of almost 
CAN$10 billion over the past decade. CFI is structured to
leverage 60% of its funding from other sources, including
the provinces. Since its inception, CFI has supported, 
through open competition, 6 000 projects at 
128 research institutions in 64 Canadian communities
(Government of Canada, 2009). An analysis of CFI’s impact
over the past five years indicates that this new
infrastructure has led to:

I the creation of more than 4 000 jobs in the public and

private sectors;

I the training of almost 11 000 technical personnel;
I the generation of more than 9 000 research

collaborations;

I the development of more than 1 500 international

research collaborations;

I the registration of 1 750 intellectual property rights

claims;

I the development of 760 new or improved products,

processes or services; and

I the creation of almost 200 spin-off companies.

Another major investment in infrastructure has come
through the CANARIE Advanced Research Network, a
sophisticated, ultra-high-speed broadband network linking
the country’s universities, hospitals, federal laboratories and
other facilities with top institutions around the globe.
CANARIE received an additional CAN$120 million in the
2007 budget. In 2009, as part of a broader economic
stimulus package, the federal government also invested
CAN$2 billion for improvements to knowledge
infrastructure in the country’s colleges and universities.

Several organizations have also called for greater
attention to be paid to entrepreneurship and producing
business, management and financial talent at Canada’s
business schools. Virtually every study on competitiveness
makes this point, arguing that innovation requires better-
informed managerial talent, rather than solely investment

in more scientists and engineers. When a 2009 study by
the Council of Canadian Academies examined how the
research produced by Canadian business and finance
schools was faring, it found that, while overall output from
this research tended to rank above the world average in
most traditional disciplines, there was a lack of explicit
relevance to potential end-users (CCA, 2009b).

include the potential for gas hydrates in Canada, the
impact of nanotechnologies on health and the
environment, the sustainable management of
groundwater, business innovation, the transmission of
influenza and design options for a proposed new
international Arctic research station. Other assessments
on animal health and biodiversity are under way;

SCIENCE GOVERNANCE
Science governance faces challenges of its own
Fixing and fuelling innovation systems also requires a sound
regulatory environment, high technical standards and well-
framed conditions to support the business environment. 
In a country with a long-standing social democratic
tradition, informed advice and public engagement on the
country’s future directions is a sine qua non condition. Sound
scientific advice and a strong science and innovation culture
are central to these tenets. Canada has experimented with
various institutional forms of scientific advice in the past but
few have survived. The longest-standing of these was the
Science Council of Canada, which was closed by the federal
government in 1992 after 26 years of providing a public face
and dialogue on Canadian science policy. 

In 2008, after a four-year experiment, the Office of the
National Science Advisor (which had been set up under
the former Liberal Party prime minister) was disbanded.
Borrowing from similar models in other countries, the
office had been an attempt to address an obvious gap in
the government’s ability to mobilize effectively its
advisory capacity internally on key public policy issues.
Issues it actively supported over its short life-span include
(Carty, 2008):

I the creation of the Canadian Academy of Science in

2005, now the Council of Canadian Academies, an
independent organization with a 10-year grant
endowment of CAN$ 30 million designed to assess the
science underlying important public policy issues. The
Council has produced several reports at the request of
the government, following a landmark report in 2006
on the state of S&T in Canada (CCA, 2006) which formed
the basis of the federal government’s strategy for
priority-setting.4 Assessments published by the Council

4.  STIC has subsequently produced a set of sub-priorities for the design of
Canada’s research support programmes at the request of the Minister of
Industry.

I advising on what became a CAN$ 156 million

contribution to the International Polar Year
(2007–2008), the largest ever global programme
dedicated to polar research. Canada led 44 projects in
this venture, which focused on the impact of climate
change and adaptation measures, as well as the health
and well-being of Northerners and Northern
communities. This investment stimulated a major
outreach programme in addition to mobilizing
communities, researchers and the next generation of
scholars in Arctic research. The government has also
committed to establishing a world-class research
station in the high Arctic; a feasibility study is currently
being finalized on its potential location;

I in collaboration with the heads of the research councils
and agencies, the development of a draft framework for
the funding, evaluation and oversight of major Canadian
investments in science and infrastructure. Since 2008,
Canada has continued to support several such ventures,
including NEPTUNE Canada, a CAN$300 million public–
private sector collaboration on the Pacific Coast involving
Canada and the USA that will use a cabled observatory to
expand knowledge of the ocean and ocean floor. Other
projects include the Canadian Light Source in
Saskatchewan, the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory in
Ontario and a major contribution to the Large Hadron
Collider near Geneva in Switzerland (see page 158);

I with the co-operation of aid agencies and other

departments and agencies, the drafting of an action
plan to help mobilize R&D to meet the needs of the
developing world, especially in the context of
Canada’s previous G8 commitments in health,
agriculture and innovation for development in Africa.
A multi-million dollar Development Innovation Fund
was announced in 2007 to assist in funding
breakthroughs in health and related areas for the
benefit of developing countries. Canada’s International
Development Research Centre (IDRC) was one of the
first organizations to support the establishment of

71

Canada [13] [P3]:Layout 1  18/10/10  18:07  Page 72

UNESCO SCIENCE REPORT 2010

Africa’s Science and Technology Consolidated Plan of
Action by the New Partnership for Africa’s
Development (NEPAD), announced in South Africa in
2005 (see page 297); 

I in conjunction with other international obligations, 
the National Science Advisor worked closely with the
international trade department to help design the
International Science and Technology Partnerships
programme (ISTP) that is now providing
CAN$20 million for enhanced R&D partnerships with
Brazil, China, India and Israel. The ISTP has led to over
30 funded joint projects with China and India (ISTP,
2009). Moreover, a new experiment in trilateral 
co-operation involving Canada, China and Israel in 
agri-innovation shows considerable promise for other
such partnerships in the future (ISTP, 2009). In addition,
the National Science Advisor helped to shape the
Canada–California Strategic Innovation Partnership
(CCSIP), which has since resulted in the creation of a
bilateral Cancer Stem Cell Consortium announced by
the Minister of Health and the Governor of California 
in May 2008. In December 2008, a CAN$2 million joint 
call for proposals was launched under the CCSIP,
resulting in over 100 expressions of interest from 
some 23 Canadian universities.

In 2007, the federal government phased out several 
other S&T advisory groups, including the Council of 
S&T Advisors and the National Biotechnology Advisory
Council. These were replaced with a new Science,
Technology and Innovation Council (STIC) made up of
experts from across the country and senior officials from
various science-based departments. An advisory body
that reports to the Minister of Industry, the STIC
constitutes an element of the federal Science and
Technology Strategy of 2007.

The STIC provides S&T advice on issues referred to it by
the government, such as the design of new S&T
scholarships or how to enhance Canada’s S&T role
internationally. The council is mandated to produce a
regular national report benchmarking Canada’s
performance in S&T against international standards of
excellence, the first of which was published in May 2009
(STIC, 2009). Unlike similar bodies in other jurisdictions,
the public is not privy to the work of STIC, with the
exception of its national report. STIC provides advice to
the government on a confidential basis.

72

CONCLUSION
Looking forward
The next phase of Canada’s knowledge investment is
unclear, in a rapidly changing S&T environment with
diminishing expectations and new priorities, and amid
pressing domestic and global demands. From 2001, when
Canada’s R&D effort reached a high of 2.09% of GDP, GERD
declined to 1.84% of GDP in 2008 (Table 1). Federal R&D
expenditure is expected to drop to 2.6% in 2008/2009
from 2.9% the previous year. In 2008, direct federal
funding of R&D amounted to CAN$5.2 billion, or just
under one-sixth of the country’s total R&D funding. While
the federal government’s overall spending on S&T was
about CAN$9.9 billion in 2008–2009, S&T accounted for
about 4.1% of the total federal government budget, down
from 4.6% over the previous two years.

Responding in part to critics of its tepid investment to date,
the federal government announced in March 2010 a suite of
new innovation and research measures spanning 2010 and
2011. These include a five-year postdoctoral fellowship
programme of CAN$45 million; small increases over two
years to the grants councils (totalling CAN$32 million per
year); a one-time investment of CAN$75 million to Genome
Canada; CAN$135 million to the NRC for its regional
innovation clusters; and CAN$50 million over the same
period to TRIUMF, Canada`s premier national facility for
nuclear and particle physics. The 2010 Budget also invested
CAN$397 million over five years to develop the next-
generation remote-sensing radar satellite: RADARSAT.  
A programme for college and community innovation will also
receive an additional CAN$15 million per year and 
CAN$49 million in annual funding for two years has been
earmarked for the regional development agencies to enable
them to continue supporting innovation across the country.
The proposed Canadian High Arctic Research Station received
new funding for a pre-construction design phase and the
ISTPP programme with India, China, Brazil and Israel was
extended for another two years with an additional 
CAN$8 million. Nonetheless, with a looming austerity
programme to reduce Canada`s budget deficit by 2016, many
predict tougher times ahead for research and other areas of
discretionary spending. The onus will be on the research and
innovation community to continue to make its case.

There is an animated and re-emerging public policy debate
at the moment on limiting potential brain drain, as US
spending on R&D and other incentives are ramped up

proportionately more than Canada’s own investment. 
The same can be said of investment by other competitors,
such as China, France, Germany, India and the Republic of
Korea. In a trend that is somewhat in line with other
countries, government policies are increasingly focusing on
the need  to frame research for commercial results and direct
areas of priority. Nonetheless, even the co-founder of
Canada’s largest high-tech company, Research in Motion –
makers of the Blackberry – has warned of the perils of
ignoring basic research (Lazaridis, 2009). Mike Lazaridis has
invested over CAN$150 million of his personal fortune to
create the world-class Perimeter Institute for Theoretical
Physics (PI) and the Institute for Quantum Computing. 
These are both located at Waterloo, Ontario, one of the
country’s most dynamic knowledge clusters. Some of the
funding for these two institutes has come from federal and
provincial governments.5

Canada’s structural weaknesses in competitiveness and
innovation remain but projects to enhance technology and
its commercialization are on the rise. These are still too few
and far between, however. If Canada is to maintain its current
level of prosperity, they will need to be expanded on, with all
relevant sectors working together. Examples of such projects
are:

I the Medical and Related Sciences (MaRS) Discovery

District in Toronto;

I the biopharma and nanotechnology clusters in Quebec;
I the marine and oceans research complexes in Halifax and

St John’s;

I the nanotechnology, energy and water research institutes

in Alberta; and

I the biotechnology and bio-products cluster in

Saskatchewan.

The mission of Canada’s over 200 federal laboratories, which
serve the public good in areas that include health, the
environment, agriculture and food safety, is changing as the
R&D capacity of these laboratories slowly erodes. In
recognition of this decline, these laboratories received a two-
year injection of CAN$250 million from the federal
government to help cover the cost of deferred maintenance.
An expert panel appointed by the federal government in
2008 examined ways in which the federal laboratories might
better adopt new business models, in collaboration with

universities, and analysed various forms of privatization.
Several new models for partnership in the fields of materials,
geosciences and nanotechnologies are being put in place as
a result. One good example is the National Institute for
Nanotechnology, established in 2001 on the campus of the
University of Alberta with the support of the NRC and federal
and provincial governments.

Diversifying partners in scientific collaboration
Canada’s global partnerships are also shifting to address the
country’s changing domestic needs. A recent study has
demonstrated that, while the USA continues to be the
country’s largest S&T partner by far – in 2008, over 51% of
Canadian scientific papers were co-authored with US
researchers, streets ahead of the next biggest partner, the UK
(8.1%) – the fastest growth in bilateral scientific collaboration
is occurring with emerging Asian and Latin American
economies, as well as with some Nordic countries. These
countries include China, Finland, the Republic of Korea and
Norway (Science-Metrix, 2009).

With respect to multilateral membership of various ‘clubs’,
Canada continues to participate in such groups as the
Asia–Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), the
Organization of American States (OAS),6 the United
Nations, the Francophonie – bringing together French-
speaking countries – and the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization. Despite some significant earlier investment
in development research, there are signs of a slowdown, as
aid and capacity-building shift towards other geopolitical
priorities, among them Afghanistan and the Americas.
Canada’s expertise in supporting S&T for development was
put to the test with the G8 and G20 meetings in 2010, as it
sought to strengthen partnerships with Africa and other
developing regions in specific programmatic areas
associated with global health via the launch of the
Development Innovation Fund. Funding will be delivered
by Grand Challenges Canada, a programme instigated by
the federal government in 2008 and endowed with
CAN$225 million over five years. The programme will
‘support the best minds in the world as they search for
breakthroughs in global health and other areas that have the
potential to bring about enduring changes in the lives of the
millions of people in poor countries.' Grand Challenges
Canada will be implemented in collaboration with the
IDRC and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.

UNESCO SCIENCE REPORT 2010

Developing a science culture
In addition to the pursuit of priority-setting and the
examination of its appropriate place in shaping future
public policy and investment in innovation and R&D, other
debates are emerging. These are centred on improving the
science culture and outreach in the country, including by
augmenting the participation of women and the
Aboriginal population in the knowledge society (Dufour,
2009). Women account for 47% of the labour force and
57% of university graduates but only 20% of doctoral
degrees awarded in science and engineering.

Some of the responsibility for Canada’s deteriorating
appreciation of the value of knowledge centres on its lack
of a science culture in its widest form, both in the political
realm and among certain segments of the population and
research community. There is an antagonism here
between what some have termed a ‘politically clueless
research community versus a scientifically illiterate
political class’. A Science Media Centre has been proposed
to improve science communication within the media.
Efforts are also under way at various science centres and
museums across the country to strengthen public
understanding. Events include a National Science and
Technology Week and a major physics festival organized
by the Perimeter Institute. Some provinces, especially in
Quebec, have long-standing traditions and tools in
support of science outreach, given the promotion of
science in the French language.

Overall, however, the science culture gap remains. The
scientific communities must share some of the
responsibility for this. Often poorly organized, with limited
means of outreach and inadequate communication tools,
the research lobbies are increasingly faced with having to
make a better case for why the future of the country lies
with more, rather than less, research and technology –
innovation in its broadest sense.

The private sector is also struggling to be more effective in
articulating its own needs and concerns over the lack of
necessary resources and strategic vision. If it can succeed

in forging stronger partnerships, while recognizing the
value of adopting new business innovation models, 
the private sector can emerge as a stronger actor in the
country’s competitive future.

With continued public policy leadership and by building
on its considerable physical and intellectual assets within
a larger societal debate on knowledge for development,
Canada’s innovative path shows considerable promise as it
sets out to enhance its reputation as a Northern Minerva.7

INTRODUCTION

The global economic recession has struck Latin American
countries1 with varying intensity: in 2009, growth slowed in
some countries, like Brazil, and was negative in others, like
Argentina. However, the impact of the recession seems to
have had a less dramatic impact on the region than on other
parts of the world. At the time of writing in early 2010, the
worst appears to be over, with Latin American economies
now on a path to recovery. Peru, Chile and Brazil should lead
with growth rates of more than 3.5% in 2010. The Brazilian
government announced in late 2009 that the country had
relegated the recession to the past; effectively, Brazil’s
employment rate has risen steadily since the second half of
2009. Argentina’s economy is also showing signs of recovery
and should grow by 1.5% in 2010, albeit at a slower pace than
before the recession. Mexico, on the other hand, has been
deeply affected, due to the imbrication of its economy with
North American markets. However, Mexico should bounce
back in 2010, with growth forecast of around 3%. Venezuela
will not be so fortunate, as its economy is expected to
contract slightly again in 2010 (Casamérica, 2010).

In the meantime, the gap between rich and poor in Latin
America remains one of the widest in the world. The
region faces pressing social issues such as poverty and
marginalization, which deprive many of education, health
care and housing, among other basic rights. The impact of
the current recession on employment will probably
exacerbate social tensions and push some communities
farther to the margins of society. 

According to 2006 data from the United Nations Economic
Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean – the last
year for which data are available – more than one-third of
Latin Americans, or 200 million people, live beneath the
breadline and 13.4%, or 80 million, in extreme poverty. The
stratum composed of 40% of Latin American homes in the
lowest income bracket concentrates as little as 14% of
aggregate income, on average (ECLAC, 2007). 

Even though these figures have improved slightly since
2002 as a result of growth, the structural weaknesses of
Latin American countries persist: economies oriented
towards commodities, low levels of industrialization, a
regressive income distribution rate and limited access to

1. ‘Latin America’ refers in the current chapter to the countries in Figure 1.

international funding as a result of difficulties in repaying
foreign debt in earlier decades. 

Paradoxically, the fact that Latin American countries are
producers of commodities has been a comparative
advantage in the past few years of growing international
demand. Recent data show that international prices for
commodities are going up again, which is very good news
for Latin American economies. If this is confirmed as a long-
term trend, the pace of economic growth will not be so
negatively affected in coming years by price fluctuations. 

One of the main symptoms of persistent poverty is
growing urban segregation, with slums spreading in many
of the region’s major metropolises. In parallel, a report by
the International Labour Organization (ILO, 2007) notes
that, among Latin American youth aged 15–24 years,       
30 million out of a labour force of 48 million are employed
in the informal economy where working conditions are
poor. A further 10 million are unemployed. Of the 
22 million young people who neither study nor work and
have never registered as unemployed, 79% live in urban
areas. This shows that equity, an intrinsic dimension of
development, has still not been attained in Latin American
countries, despite being a long-standing goal.

Even an emerging economy like Brazil presents the
urban–rural, rich–poor divide that is widespread in Latin
America. The problem of uneven development, with
scientific institutions being concentrated essentially in the
capital and other major cities, is typical of the region and
can be observed, for example, in São Paulo and Rio de
Janeiro, Buenos Aires and Mexico City.

It is difficult to consider Latin America as a whole, since
one of the most prominent characteristics of the region is
its heterogeneity, both between and within countries. Just
five countries concentrate 80% of regional GDP (Figure 1).
This concentration highlights the need for very diverse
development strategies, which will in turn have an impact
on the type of science, technology and innovation (STI)
policy adopted by each country.

New development paths must be explored in Latin America
if the region is to generate more wealth and improve wealth
distribution. These new paths must value available resources,
among which knowledge must take a central place. STI must
play an increasingly important role in achieving growth and
equality.

STI POLICIES TO PROMOTE
INNOVATION AND SOCIAL EQUITY 
Most of the region’s existing institutions were inspired by
what is now known as the ‘linear model’. The aim of the
linear model was primarily to ensure good-quality basic
research. It was assumed that this would guarantee the
availability of applied research and that the benefits of
science would in turn overflow into society as a whole.
The linear model met with some success in creating or
consolidating the scientific community of each country
but was of little efficacy when it came to transferring
knowledge to the productive sector; this gave rise to the
configuration of an academic sector relatively isolated
from society. The outdated linear model is still alive and
well in many countries of the region. 

The Conference on Science, Technology and Innovation for
Sustainable Development in Latin America and the
Caribbean, organized by UNESCO in Havana, Cuba, in 2005,
addressed the lack of correlation between the spheres of
production and the use of knowledge, which in turn leads
to a mismatch between the expectations of the scientific
and business communities as to the use of knowledge.
The conference also addressed the issue of existing

tensions between democratization, on the one hand, 
and the satisfaction of social needs, on the other, and
emphasized the effect of those tensions on science and
technology (S&T) policies, in the sense that research and
development (R&D) could make a remarkable contribution
to social cohesion and the exercise of citizenship.

With Latin American countries now attempting to promote
innovation within a development strategy that includes
social equity, it has become necessary to revisit science
policy models and instigate institutional modernization.
Signs of change can be detected in the organization of R&D
and STI policies in many Latin American countries. Since the
mid-1990s, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and
Venezuela, among others, have all been implementing
institutional reforms to speed up procedures for resource
allocation and make these procedures more transparent.
In more recent years, other countries have followed the
same path, among them Paraguay, Peru and Uruguay.
Reforms have also focused on assessing R&D results,
promoting innovation, strengthening the relationship
between research centres and business, designing long-
term policies, employing strategic intelligence tools,
monitoring public opinion on S&T issues and disseminating
knowledge. Among other reforms characteristic of the

78

Latin America

most advanced institutional systems is the adaptation of
universities to the new social reality, with the development
of linkages to enterprises and other social actors.

There has been a shift in policy from the linear model
towards a more dynamic model, in which R&D is demand-
driven and based on specific needs for knowledge and
policy is supportive of innovation. One example is the
creation of the Agency for the Promotion of Science and
Technology in Argentina in 1996, which has been endowed
with funds to finance R&D and innovation (Box 1). In Chile,
multiple funds have been set up since 1981 to finance a
wide range of projects ranging from centres of excellence
to projects for innovation and the creation of networks
linking public and private R&D institutes. In Brazil, sector-
specific funds were created in 1999 to raise the level of
R&D funding (see page 106). More recently, Uruguay
established the National Agency for Research and
Innovation (ANII) in 2005 to consolidate competitive 
funds. The same year, a loan from the InterAmerican
Development Bank enabled Peru to set up a Science,
Technology and Innovation Fund to finance R&D
programmes and projects of private enterprises. 
The Fund’s Board of Directors is made up of
representatives of the scientific and academic
communities, the government and private sector.

Currently, S&T policies in the region are based on specific
legislation, much of which was drafted in the founding
moments of countries’ respective S&T systems.
Nevertheless, a significant change came about at the turn
of the century in many countries with the passing of
legislation that restructured S&T institutions and, in many
cases, incorporated innovation, thereby creating an STI
system: Argentina’s Congress passed a Science Law in 2001,
a year before Mexico passed its own Science Law, followed
by a second law establishing the statutes of the National
Council for Science and Technology (CONACYT) in 2006.
The National Council of Innovation for Competitiveness was
created in Chile by President Lagos in 2005 and renewed in
2006 by President Bachelet to provide the presidency with
a permanent advisory body. This set of institutional
novelties reflects, on the one hand, the growing visibility of
S&T policies within the framework of broader development
policies and, on the other hand, the beginning of a new
generation of policy instruments incorporating innovation.

here. Although there are public organizations dedicated to
R&D in every Latin American country, the circumstances in
the various countries vary from those having large and
complex systems – such as Brazil, Argentina, Mexico and
Chile – to those with only a sprinkling of weak institutions of
higher education and no S&T system worthy of the name.
A study published in 2009 by the InterAmerican
Development Bank and the Centre for Studies on Science,
Development and Higher Education (Centro REDES) in 2009
identifies 30 different types of S&T policy instruments
grouped in six main categories. The only countries having
instruments for every category are Argentina, Brazil, Chile,
Mexico and Uruguay. Colombia and Venezuela have very
incipient S&T systems compared to those of the five leaders,
according to Emiliozzi (2009) and Lemarchand (2009).

In recent years, many countries have implemented
mechanisms and programmes to evaluate the
performance of public STI policies. The evaluation of
public policies, through different assessments, follow-up,
monitoring and accountability mechanisms, has been one
of the elements promoted by the state reforms introduced
throughout the region since the 1990s.

On a political level, there has also been greater government
interest in promoting a science culture and citizen
participation. Latin America has been no stranger to the
trend towards democratization of knowledge. Many surveys
of the public perception of science have been conducted in
recent years, as a result of the creation of a network within
which academics and officials of national S&T organizations
in Latin American countries have been working together to
build a consensus on methodology (Box 2).

R&D INPUT

Trends in R&D expenditure
The Achilles Tendon of STI policies in Latin America remains
the low level of investment in R&D, with the notable
exception of Brazil, which contributes as much as 60% of
the region’s investment in R&D. There has, however, been
an upturn in the region since 2004. After remaining stable
at around US$ 10 billion from 1996 to 2004, gross domestic
expenditure on R&D (GERD) jumped to US$ 23.1 billion in
2007, boosted by economic growth (Figure 3).

As regards the composition of the institutional systems of
S&T, the heterogeneity across the region is again apparent

In 2006, GERD in Latin America and the Caribbean
represented 0.68% of GDP, or 1.9% of global spending on R&D.

UNESCO SCIENCE REPORT 2010

Box 1: Promoting innovation in Argentina

Founded in 1996, Agentina’s National
Agency for the Promotion of Science
and Technology (Agencia Nacional de
Pro moción Científica y Tecnológica,
ANPCYT) channels funding into R&D
projects and infrastructure
development. A decentralized body,
it reports to the Ministry of Science,
Technology and Productive
Innovation (MIN CYT) set up in 2007. 

The agency manages the

following funds:

I the Technological Fund of Argenti -

na (Fondo Tecnológico Argentino,
FONTAR), which finances
technological modernization and
innovation in the productive sector,
including via technological services
for institutions and small and
medium-sized enterprises,
technical assistance and training,
entrepreneurial incubators and
technology parks and poles;

I the Scientific and Technological

Research Fund (Fondo para la
Investigación Científica y
Tecnológica, FONCYT), which

provides public or private non-
profit R&D institutions with subsidies;

I the Trust Fund for Promotion of the
Software In dustry (Fondo Fiduciario
de Promoción de la Industria del
Software, FONSOFT), which was
created by law in 2004 and
finances development of the
software industry in small and
medium-sized enterprises;

I the Sectoral Fund (Fondo Argentino

Sectorial, FONARSEC), which
provides subsidies for the
upgrading of R&D capacities for
transfer to the productive and
social sectors.

In 2008, the agency awarded a

total of US$ 234.6 million for the
execution of 2293 R&D projects. Of
this, US$ 135 million went to FONCYT,
US$ 94 million to FONTAR and 
US$ 5 million to FONSOFT. Some 22%
(US$ 30 million) of the total amount
allocated to FONCYT in 2008 was
awarded within its Programme in
Strategic Areas (Figure 2).

The Observatory of Venture Capital, 
a non-profit organization, was set up by
the Science and Technology Ventures
Institute (IECYT) in 2003 to group
entrepreneurs and researchers. According
to a 2008 survey by the observatory, the
most attractive sectors for venture capital
in Argentina are software and computer
sciences (17%), the food industry (14%),
Internet (13%), non-financial services
(13%), media and entertainment (10%),
biotechnology (10%), automation (7%)
and health (7%). Start-up companies tend
to attract the most funds (77%). 

Although US$ 70 million in

venture capital was available in 2008,
the observatory found that less than
10% was actually invested. The survey
also found that venture capital was
mostly mobilized from national
sources, even though European funds
and funds from the InterAmerican
Development Bank and other
multilateral agencies were also
available.

Box 2: Public perception of science

Surveys of the public perception of
science have been conducted
nationwide in Latin American
countries over the past two decades.
In 2007, one of these surveys focused
on six cities: Buenos Aires (Argentina),
Bogotá (Colombia), Caracas
(Venezuela), Panama City (Panama),
São Paulo (Brazil) and Santiago (Chile).
The questionnaire was developed
around four topics: information and
interest in science; citizenship and
public policies on S&T; attitudes
towards S&T; and social appropriation
of S&T.

The survey found that only one in
ten newspaper readers and television
viewers were interested in topics
related to S&T. The same held true for
web searches for information on
science, reading of science
magazines or specialized books and
visits to museums, science centres
and exhibitions. 

Likewise, in the part of the survey

devoted to citizenship and public
policies on S&T, most respondents were

unable to name a single scientific
institution in their country. 

The results were more ambivalent

when the question targeted public
perception of a country’s prominence in
S&T: optimism was stronger in Bogotá
and São Paulo, where half of
respondents considered their respective
countries to be ‘very’ or ‘somewhat’
prominent. The four remaining cities
were more pessimistic, with Santiago
(Chile) heading this category. 

One set of questions analysed the
value people attached to science as a
career choice. Most respondents
considered the profession of scientist to
be rewarding, which is consistent with
the high value generally attached to the
profession in terms of social prestige.
However, not all the cities considered
the income of scientists to be adequate;
whereas most respondents in São Paulo,
Santiago and Caracas said that scientists
in their countries were well paid, two-
thirds of respondents in Buenos Aires felt
that researchers received inadequate
compensation. 

In terms of the public perception of

the risks and benefits of S&T,
respondents in all but Caracas said that,
in the next 20 years, ‘many’ or ‘plenty of’
risks derived from S&T activities would
have to be addressed. However, this did
not prevent 76% of respondents from
pointing out that S&T could bring
‘many’ or ‘plenty of’ benefits. Likewise,
most respondents said that they were
aware of the political and economic
implications of science, as well as of the
need to consider criteria other than
technical elements for the development
of laws and regulations. Respondents
also tended to be in favour of
promoting citizen participation in
decision-making related to S&T.

Most respondents were found to

attach value to having S&T in their lives.
This was reflected in their perception of
S&T as being useful for understanding
the world, for health care, for
conservation of the environment and
for decision-making in their capacity as
consumers, among other aspects.

If we convert this figure to reflect purchasing power parity
(PPP), the percentage climbs to 3.0% of the world total
(see page 2). This suggests that Latin America’s GERD/GDP
ratio has remained stable since 2002, even if its global
share expressed in US$ PPP is up slightly from 2.8%.
Economic growth across the region has thus not
translated into a stronger financial commitment to R&D.
Mexico and Argentina even fall below the region’s mean
value, although, in the case of Argentina, this poor
performance is due to the 2002 economic crash (Figure 4).
Brazil, Mexico, Argentina and Chile alone account for nine-
tenths of the region’s investment in R&D (Figure 5). 

In recent years, several countries have instituted reforms to
decentralize and allocate resources via competitive
mechanisms. Such is the case of Peru, which created the

National Fund for Scientific and Technological Development
and Innovation (FONDECYT) in 2006 to raise, manage,
administer and channel domestic and foreign resources for
the activities of the National Science, Technology and
Innovation System (SINACYT). Furthermore, a series of
initiatives have given public research institutions greater
organizational and financial autonomy.

In Latin America, R&D is largely dependent on public
funds. Nearly two-thirds of R&D is funded by the
government. Moreover, nearly 40% of government funds
are invested in university research, the remainder being
channelled into public research institutes. This funding
pattern runs counter to that of industrialized countries,
where up to two-thirds of the resources allocated to R&D
come from the business sector.

Fostering private R&D investment and innovation is an
issue of major concern to most countries, as it is a process
that requires specific financial instruments to stimulate
investment. In this context, those countries with greater
relative development have incorporated more ambitious
objectives in their STI policies for fostering business R&D.
In Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Mexico, policies

set out to encourage innovation in small and medium-
sized enterprises and to foster the development of high-
tech industries and sector clusters. Additional measures to
support infrastructure, modernization, technology
dissemination and the training of skilled personnel are
also in place. Some of these objectives are also reflected in
the policies of the remaining countries.

Almost all countries in the region have developed
instruments and provide direct public funding for
business R&D and innovation. Argentina, Chile, Colombia,
Mexico and Panama, for example, all use grant funds,
basket funds and project-financing mechanisms.
In addition, many countries have implemented tax
mechanisms to stimulate R&D and innovation in this
sector (on Brazil, see page 108). Most countries also employ

other public instruments to fund innovation, such as
venture capital, seed funds and measures for small and
médium-sized enterprises or technology business
incubators (Figure 6). 

Trends in researchers 
Disposing of an adequate number of scientists and
engineers is a prerequisite for sustaining policies for
development and social inclusion. For this indicator, the
regional scenario is looking more promising than for
investment: Latin American countries counted more than
252 000 full-time equivalent (FTE) researchers in 2007.
Although they accounted for only 3.5% of the world total,
placing Latin America and the Caribbean in a marginal
position, this share is higher than that for GERD 
(see page 8).

The number of researchers and engineers in Latin
American countries nearly doubled between 2000 and
2007 (Figure 7). Between 1996 and 2000, annual growth
ranged between 3% and 4%. After a brief deceleration in
2001 when growth stood at around 2%, the positive trend
regained momentum. This trend contrasts with the ups
and downs in the curve for GERD (Figure 3).

This performance underscores the efforts made by many
countries to implement training policies to consolidate
their S&T base. For example, one of the main thrusts of
Brazil’s Plan for 2007–2010 is to train and retain human

resources in priority areas (see page 118). Similarly, the goal
of Argentina’s Medium-Term Strategic Plan (2005–2015) is to
attain the ratio of three scientists and engineers for every 
1 000 Argentinians who are economically active. Argentina
is moving towards this goal. Ever since 2005, Argentina’s
primary body for promoting S&T, the National Council for
Scientific and Technological Research (CONICET), has taken
in 1 500 PhD students annually, leading to a pool of nearly
7 000 active scholarship-holders in 2009. Chile and
Venezuela have taken similar steps. 

Nevertheless, the distribution of scientists and engineers
among Latin American countries confirms the region’s
heterogeneity. If improving access to knowledge tools is
one of the main strategies for societies wishing to embrace
socially and environmentally sustainable development,
there is an evident correlation between the distribution of
S&T capabilities and the distribution of wealth. Figure 8
shows that four countries concentrate more than 90% of
scientists and engineers in Latin America, even though
some small countries like Cuba also have a high ratio (see
page 124). The region’s heterogeneity must be taken into
account in any assessment of regional capacities.
Moreover, strengthening the scientific capacity of the
weakest countries should be an important goal of
development policies and policies fostering regional
cohesion.

84

Consolidating a country’s S&T base means being able to
count on a critical mass of scientists, engineers and other
highly skilled professionals. This depends mainly on two
factors, the existence of a university system with a high
standard of excellence at the graduate and postgraduate
levels, and a set of conditions preventing large-scale
migration of the most highly qualified professionals.
As regards the first factor, very few doctoral candidates are
trained each year in most Latin American countries (Figure 9).
This is partly due to a university tradition of prioritizing
excellence in undergraduate studies via much more
comprehensive curricula than in English-speaking countries.
If Brazil counts proportionally more doctoral candidates than
Argentina, Chile or Mexico, this is because, since the 1960s,
Brazil has implemented a sound, sustainable doctoral
training policy (see page 111). Brazil also has the advantage of
having a university system based on the Anglo-Saxon model,
rather than on that of any other Latin American country. 

Most countries offer budgetary and financial incentives,
as well as scholarships, to strengthen higher education in
S&T disciplines. In some countries, there are specific
funding channels for improving the infrastructure of
higher education centres in these areas of study. Examples
are Argentina, Colombia and Peru. Furthermore, even if
they differ, most countries have policies to facilitate
education and the placement of scientists and engineers.

Trends in migration
Three different aspects of brain drain in Latin America deserve
consideration: the magnitude of the phenomenon, the loss of
qualified personnel2 and, lastly, the educational selectivity of
migration streams or, in other words, the ratio of university-
trained personnel to the total number of migrants from a
country (Luchilo, 2007). Recent censuses on this theme
carried out in the member states of the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) show that
approximately 1.5 million Latin American university graduates
resided in OECD countries at the time (Luchilo, 2007). The
magnitude of brain drain was low for Argentina (4.7%) and
Brazil (3.3%), medium for Mexico (14.3%) and Colombia
(11%), and high for Nicaragua (30.9%) and Cuba (28.9%).

Within the broader phenomenon of migration of highly
qualified labour, it is particularly interesting to analyse the
migration of scientists and engineers. Data from the US
National Science Foundation (NSF) show that, by the late
1990s, foreigners represented 21.5% of active R&D
personnel in the USA. Latin Americans made up 9% of this
group, far behind the largest group, the Asians, with 60%.
By the turn of the century, Spain had become another
pole of attraction for highly qualified Latin American
immigrants. The 2001 Spanish population census3 shows
the presence of approximately 9 000 Latin American PhD-
holders residing in Spain. In 2001, most were Argentinian
(1 247), followed by Colombian (907), Venezuelan (664),
Ecuadorian (638) and Peruvian (576) PhD-holders.

2. Qualified personnel is defined as the ratio of university graduates to total
graduates born in a given country.

3. The next Spanish population census will be conducted in 2011.

Two causes of brain drain are low wages in the country of
origin and the underutilization of human resources, owing to
the low absorption of professional and technical personnel.
In addition to this, younger workers find it highly desirable to
pursue graduate and postgraduate studies abroad. They
generally feel that studying abroad will offer them better
opportunities for their professional and economic future.
The combination of a global educational offer, lower related
costs and the multiplication of agreements between the
universities of different countries only serve to nourish this
phenomenon (Martínez Pizarro, 2005).

Gender issues
With 41% of all S&T-related jobs held by women, up
10 percentage points on a decade ago, Latin America is one
of the regions with the highest female participation in
science. This bright picture is counterbalanced, however, by
the persistence of institutional practices and preconceptions
symptomatic of a devaluation of women’s work. This
translates into the so-called ‘glass ceiling’, those invisible
barriers that prevent women from attaining senior positions.

In this context, universities represent an institutional sector
open to women, female participation being high in faculty

and academic research positions. Although there are no
aggregate data at the national level for all Latin American
countries on personnel distribution by gender and
institutional sector, some trends can be derived from
observing countries with a high impact on regional science
and those universities that enjoy great scientific prestige.
In six countries of the region, women hold between 30%
and 55% of all academic research positions in institutions of
higher education. These participation levels are higher than
in other regions, the European Union included. 

In Argentina, for example, women hold 30% of all research
positions in business enterprises, 46% in non-profit
organizations and 55% in public universities. A similar
distribution can be observed for scholarship-holders. 
This could translate into a build-up of the pool of women
researchers in the near future. However, a not-so-optimistic
interpretation points to the progressive exclusion of
women as they try to advance in their scientific career.

If we compare women’s participation in the economic and
scientific spheres, it becomes apparent that science is
more gender-inclusive in Latin America than elsewhere in
the world: in half of the Latin American countries studied

86

Latin America chapter [14] [P3]:Layout 1  18/10/10  18:11  Page 87

(RICYT, 2009), women were better represented in the S&T
sector than in the labour force in general. In some cases,
there was even a gap of between 4 and 20 percentage
points. The question of access to primary and secondary
education is relevant in this respect, since a student needs
to accumulate a certain number of years of formal
education before being admitted to a university
programme in science. In Latin America, a region with
low- and middle-income countries but one of the world’s
highest levels of social inequality, school attendance by
girls has progressed consistently to the point where, in
some cases, girls and boys have equal access to primary
and secondary education.

Gender equality has come to the university campuses of
Colombia, Chile, Costa Rica, Cuba and El Salvador in recent
years. Women even make up 60% of students in Uruguay,
Mexico and Panama, and 55% in Argentina, Venezuela,
Paraguay and Brazil. You have to look to Peru, Bolivia and a
few others to find a slight gender imbalance in favour of
men. Of note is that the ratio of women to total students is
higher among graduates than among enrolled students,
suggesting a higher graduation rate for women than men.
Female enrollment has also increased gradually at the
postgraduate level in almost all fields of study, on a par with
the growing availability of courses in the region. 

R&D OUTPUT

If scientific productivity in terms of research papers has
experienced remarkable growth in the past decade, both
quantitatively and qualitatively, the transfer of this
knowledge to the productive sectors has made little
progress. There is a lack of dynamism in the region when it
comes to patenting, suggesting that Latin American
countries (led by Brazil) are far more present in the ‘science
mainstream’ but unable to translate this into innovation. 

Trends in scientific papers
The number of papers by Latin American authors listed in
Thomson Reuter’s Science Citation Index (SCI) more than
doubled between 1997 and 2007. Although this indicator is
controversial for some disciplines, it nevertheless illustrates
a substantial increase in the quality of science in Latin
American countries.

The share of Latin American scientists in the SCI grew
steadily between 1997 and 2007, from 2.3% to 3.4%.

Latin America

Sustained steady growth relies on the performance of the
most dynamic Latin American countries, particularly Brazil,
which went from accounting for 41% of Latin American
papers in 1997 to 47% in 2007. All countries experienced
growth, albeit to a lesser degree in most cases. One
exception is Peru, where the number of scientific papers
tripled between 1997 and 2007. Interestingly, Mexico, with
output similar to that of Argentina, has surpassed the latter
ever since Argentina’s economic crisis in 2002 (Figure 10).

In other databases, a similar phenomenon can be observed
and, in some cases, the progression is even steeper. In
PASCAL, a multidisciplinary database created in France by the
Institute for Scientific and Technical Information of the
National Centre for Scientific Research, the Latin American
share nearly doubled between 1997 and 2007 from 2.2% to
3.8%. In the database of the Commonwealth Agricultural
Bureaux (CAB), the Latin American share was even greater but
growth was smaller: from 5.4% in 1997 to 7.8% in 2007. In the
Chemical Abstracts database (CA), the share was smaller but
did increase from 1.5% to 2.0%. Databases in biology (BIOSIS),
medicine (MEDLINE), engineering (COMPENDEX) and physics
(INSPEC) followed the same general trend (Figure 11). 

It is worth pointing out that Argentina, Chile and
Venezuela share a common pattern of growing output in
papers involving international collaboration, with the
flipside being a falling number of non-collaborative
papers. On the other hand, the ratio of published
collaborative papers to non-collaborative papers for Brazil
and Mexico, the countries with the greatest output in
Latin America, has remained unchanged.

Trends in patents
The number of patents is one of the indicators used to
measure the efficiency of R&D systems in exploiting
knowledge in the economic sphere. This indicator is less
relevant for Latin America than for more industrialized
countries insofar as both the economic structure and legal
frameworks discourage patenting in most Latin American
countries. However, an analysis of patent data helps to
understand the technological situation in the region and
confirms the initial diagnosis that research in Latin
America is conducted primarily in academic settings with
extremely weak ties to industry.

The number of resident patent applications in Latin
America grew by more than one-third over the period
1997–2007. The number of non-resident patent

applications grew even faster, by almost 60%. By 2007,
non-resident patent applications were three or four times
more common than those filed by residents: of 63 000
patents filed in 2007, just 21% were filed by residents
(Figures 12 and 13). This distribution is in marked contrast
to the figures for industrialized countries.

International patent databases provide a measure of
protected inventions in the main markets around the
world: the European Patent Office (EPO), the United States
Patents and Trademark Office (USPTO) and the Patent Co-
operation Treaty (PCT) database of the World Intellectual
Property Organization (WIPO). The USPTO database is a
very important indicator of technological development
around the world. Over 180 000 patents are granted each
year in the USA to holders from all countries. In the
2000–2007 period, the four Latin American countries with
the greatest presence totalled 1 591 patents, 43% of
which belonged to Brazil. The EPO database, which
registers over 55 000 patents a year, included 222 patents
from the most dynamic Latin American countries, 138 of

which were granted to Brazilian patent-holders. The last
database is that of the PCT treaty, administered by WIPO.
This database contains a total of 3 824 records from the
top four Latin American countries, 62% of which are
accounted for by Brazilian authors (Figure 14).

Various diagnostic studies and S&T policy documents
elaborated by experts and governments in the region
show that S&T systems in Latin America are characterized,
with some exceptions and nuances, by a lack of strong
links and poor co-ordination between the public R&D
sector – encompassing universities mainly – and the
business sector. 

The policies implemented show that the question of
stimulating co-operation between the public and private
sectors has been a fairly recent concern. This concern has
translated into the creation of instruments to promote
public–private sector co-operation in R&D and innovation.
There is a series of instruments available in those
countries with greater relative development, in the form
of support programmes for the development of R&D 

and innovation via public and private consortia. 
In this area, Chile, for instance, has chosen innovative
formats (Box 3). The creation of centres of excellence 
and sectoral clusters comprising both public and private
institutions and the promotion of business incubators 
and technology parks are also part of this experiment to
dynamize links between the private and public sectors.
Most countries have put in place technology transfer 
and dissemination policies, as well as programmes for 
the development of technology infrastructure and 
access to new technologies. Technological development
and extension centres have become widespread in 
the region.

NEW R&D PRIORITIES

R&D priority-setting in the region via related policies has
undergone different stages. Initially, the criteria for
resource allocation were exclusively oriented towards
excellence, in keeping with the guidelines for basic
research. During the years when emphasis was placed

on applied research and technological development,
priorities were established around productive sectors 
and public administration. Currently, in line with the 
new institutional orientations mentioned above, issues
related to innovation and the generation of a competitive
advantage have made their way onto the agenda.
Countries with greater relative development have
incorporated priorities in those S&T fields with the
greatest potential, such as biotechnology, nano-
technology and information technologies. In parallel,
several countries have developed medium- and long-term
strategic plans.

There is an array of different instruments in Mexico for
promoting STI. These policy tools have three main thrusts:
training of scientists and engineers, scientific research,
and innovation and technological development. 
The first of these thrusts includes several postgraduate
scholarships, as well as employment services and
instruments for co-operation. The second thrust includes
specific instruments for supporting basic and applied
research as well as incentive measures for the repatriation

of researchers residing abroad. Last but not least, the area
related to innovation and technological development
provides businesses with tax incentives, programmes
offering researchers sabbatical stays in the industrial
sector and mechanisms designed to foster innovation
networks.

In Argentina, the Medium-Term Strategic Plan
(2005–2015) has been designed to address challenges
related to innovation and social development. The Plan
establishes four strategic goals to guide the medium-
and long-term development of STI. The first goal has a
social dimension and relates to improving quality of life
and social development. The second goal addresses the
responsible exploitation of natural resources and
environmental protection. The third goal relates to
strengthening innovation in industry and agricultural
production, particularly in the most advanced fields,
those that nurture the development of a knowledge
economy and society. The fourth goal sets out to
strengthen Argentina’s S&T capabilities and develop its
support infrastructure.

Box 3: R&D technology business consortia in Chile

Consortia are instruments designed to
strengthen the relationship between
science and the users of scientific
advances in the public and private
sectors at national and international
levels, with a view to creating 
new business opportunities and
boosting competition. A technology
consortium is an association of
business entities and academic,
scientific and technological
institutions formed to undertake 
joint development of a research,
development and innovation
programme. This instrument seeks to
make a significant impact through the
adoption, transfer and
commercialization of research results.

The consortia in Chile were

created in 2006 to develop cutting-
edge S&T research through
public–private partnerships. The aim
is to apply knowledge to industry,
with a view to bringing together the
different links in a given production
chain. These mechanisms have been

designed to enable productive
companies, universities and other
technological entities to form
alliances to solve production
challenges have a bearing on
competitiveness and, in the 
process, develop new products,
patent any breakthroughs and
commercialize them. 

These consortia receive support
from three quarters: the Bicentennial
Science and Technology Programme
of the National Commission on
Scientific and Technological Research
(CONICYT), the INNOVA Chile
programme of the Production
Development Corporation (CORFO)
and the Fundación FIA (Foundation for
Agricultural Innovation) of the Ministry
of Agriculture. The consortia receive
considerable financial support of
around US$ 34.5 million in public
funds, in order to implement initiatives
over a maximum period of five years.
Turning to the private sector, the
idea here is to mobilize much larger

sums of money from the participating
companies and technological entities.
Each initiative has to take the form 
of a business entity, the specialization
of which will ensure excellence in
research and the application of the
results to the productive sector via
the adoption, transfer,
commercialization and dissemination
of research findings, as well as
training and inclusion of highly
qualified personnel in areas of crucial
importance for both Chilean industry
and the regions. The first technology
consortia are focusing on fruit-
farming, the dairy and wine
industries, forestry, health research,
aeronautics and the development of
by-products from waste generated by
export industries.

Nanotechnology
Nanotechnology is witnessing rapid development
worldwide, as reflected in the number of scientific
publications and patents: around the world, the number
of scientific articles on nanotechnology and nanosciences
listed by the SCI doubled between 2000 and 2006 and
the number of patents granted through the PCT
increased by more than 30%. Latin America has followed
the global trend: its publications on nanotechnology
grew by 95% between 2000 and 2006. Several countries
in the region are striving to seize the opportunities
offered by this field. 

As in other fields, Brazil is the most prominent country for
nanotechnology: in 2006, it ranked 18th in the world for
publications related to nanotechnology, with 827 articles
indexed by the SCI. Mexico came second with 376 articles

(26th) and Argentina third (37th) with 220. Trailing 
these countries, we find Chile (with 104 publications),
Colombia (60) and Cuba (45). Taking into account that, in
2006, 49 433 articles on nanotechnology were indexed by
the SCI, the total output of these six countries amounts to
3.3% of the total. This percentage share tallies with Latin
America’s average contribution to the large databases on
exact and natural sciences. However, this number greatly
exceeds the region’s average contribution to the fields of
physics, chemistry and technology.

Nanotechnology tends to give rise to collaboration. 
An analysis of the publications produced jointly by Latin
American and non-Latin American authors shows strong
co-operation between the USA and Brazil, through which
other Latin American countries such as Colombia and
Cuba are participating in the global network. 

92

Latin America chapter [14] [P3]:Layout 1  18/10/10  18:11  Page 93

Mexico likewise has direct ties with the USA. Spain,
meanwhile, serves as a rallying point to the global
network for countries such as Argentina, Chile, Uruguay
and Venezuela.

The region’s weakness in terms of productivity becomes
apparent when we examine the number of patents filed 
in the PCT database. This database lists 43 887 nano
technology patents granted between 2003 and 2006, out
of which only 100 (0.22% of the total) are held by Latin
Americans. In this context, Brazil is, once again, the
leading country insofar as it holds 45 of the 100 patents,
followed by Mexico with 20, Argentina with 11 and Chile
with 9. The remainder of the patents belong to Cuba,
Honduras, Panama and Uruguay. Of note is that, in 2006,
Brazil doubled the number of patents it had held in 2003.

The region’s showing improves slightly when it comes to
inventors: according to the PCT database, 277 patents
(0.51% of the total) belonged to a Latin American inventor
for the period 2003–2006. Once again, first place goes to
Brazil, with 84 patents. Argentina ranks second, with
46 patents, followed by Mexico, with 41. Chile trails this
group with 18 patents and Colombia with 13 – reflecting
the fact that Colombian investors participated in
developing patents even though the country does not
own any. There were ten other Latin American countries
where local investors owned patents. 

Going against the global trend, the specialization of Latin
Americans in the field of nanomedicine and nanobiology
(BIO) is remarkable and has earned them third place in the
world. This field represents 82% of the patents granted to
Argentina, 69% of Brazilian patents and 45% of Mexican
patents.

In conclusion, there are encouraging indicators for
nanotechnology in Latin America, in spite of the fact that
the region is going through an incipient stage of
development in this field. Both the number of articles
published in scientific journals and the volume of patents
have grown in recent years. However, the region’s
percentage share for both articles and patents related to
nanotechnology remains low. In this field, the productive
structure would seem to be lagging behind the academic
capacity. In this regard, Latin Americans conducting R&D
on nanosciences and nanotechnology – two fields which
are increasingly being integrated into international
networks – represent a reservoir of capacity.

Latin America

Biotechnology
The region’s capabilities in biotechnology are, to a large
extent, derived from its historical S&T development. 
There are various institutions and groups in Latin America
with a long-standing tradition in agricultural research and
biology, among other areas related to biotechnology
research. Brazil, Argentina and Mexico stand out in this
field. Among the leading groups in Brazil are those based
at the University of São Paulo, the Fiocruz Foundation and
the University of Campinas. In Argentina, the University of
Buenos Aires, the Institute of Biology and Experimental
Medicine (IBYME) and the National University of La Plata
occupy a prominent place. The National Autonomous
University of Mexico (UNAM) is also of international repute.

Latin America provides 3% of the 365 783 documents on
biotechnology available in the SCI for the period
2000–2007. Within Latin America, MERCOSUR countries
(see page 96) account for 65% of publications, or 2% of the
world total. Brazil’s leadership in this field is unrivalled:
the country accounts for 76% of articles produced by
MERCOSUR countries and 49% of articles for Latin America
as a whole. Brazil’s growth in recent years largely exceeds
that of its regional peers. The trend has even accelerated:
in 2000, Brazil increased its productivity by a factor of 2.5
over its immediate rival in biotechnology, Mexico; in 2007,
Brazil’s productivity grew by a factor of 3.3. If we contain
the analysis to the MERCOSUR countries, the picture is
similar: whereas, in 2000, Brazil produced twice as many
articles as its immediate rival in the trade bloc, Argentina,
in 2007 it produced four times as many. Even though
Mexico and Argentina have shown very similar production
rates and growth patterns over the same period, Mexico
has experienced slightly higher growth than Argentina
since 2002. 

This bibliographical analysis reveals that Latin American
countries tend to build relationships with the leading
countries in this field. This is hardly surprising, considering
the degree of concentration in biotechnology worldwide:
the USA, Japan, Germany, UK and France produced
slightly more than 70% of all papers on biotechnology
published in 2000–2007. As a result, Latin American
countries have tended to build stronger relationships with
extra-regional countries – mainly the USA and, to a lesser
extent, in Europe – than with each other. Brazil and
Argentina have, for example, developed ties through
joint publications with authors from countries beyond
the region.

Box 4: Aeronautics in Brazil: the case of EMBRAER

The development of the aeronautic
industry was promoted by the Brazilian
government in the 1940s as an
instrument for the country’s
technological development. The first
step towards this goal was the
founding in 1954 of the Institute for
Research and Development (IPD), the
current Aeronautic and Spatial Institute
(IAE). In 1965, the IPD was entrusted
with designing a plane equipped with
a turboprop engine. The aircraft made
its maiden flight three years later
before being commercialized under
the name of Bandeirante.

In 1969, the Ministry of

Aeronautics created the Empresa
Brasileira de Aeronáutica S.A. (Brazilian
Aeronautic Enterprise, EMBRAER).
EMBRAER’s mission was to produce
aircraft designed using Brazilian
technology on a commercial scale.
Bandeirante’s first three series were
delivered to the Brazilian Air Force in
1973. In the same year, the firm
Transbrasil purchased the first
Bandeirante for commercial use. The
planes were first exported in 1975.
EMBRAER would ultimately conquer
36 markets around the world. 

On the orders of the Ministry of

Aeronautics, EMBRAER developed
its first combat aircraft, the Tucano,

which made its maiden flight on
16 December 1980. The aircraft would
go on to become the most successful
project for military training ever built,
with more than 650 units sold all over
the world. 

In July 1981, EMBRAER was
invited to join the Italian AMX
International Programme to construct
a subsonic combat aircraft. Together
with an Italian firm, EMBRAER worked
on developing the AMX fighter,
designed to replace the old military
fleets of Italy and Brazil. The first
Brazilian AMX made its maiden flight
on 16 October 1985. This project
allowed EMBRAER to access new
technologies that would be crucial
for future projects. 

The development of a regional
aircraft to replace the Bandeirante
began in the late 1970s. The result was a
twin-turboprop commercial airliner
called the EMB-120 Brasilia with a
capacity for 30-40 seats certified for
commercial service in 1985. Unlike the
Bandeirante, the Brasilia started out as
an export product, entering into service
for the American airline Atlantic
Southeast Airlines. The EMB-120 Brasilia
owed its success to the trust won by
EMBRAER in the world aviation market
thanks to the Bandeirante. 

Officially, production of the Brasilia

ended in 2002 with 350 units having
been sold; however, the aircraft is still
being produced on demand. 

Today, EMBRAER produces

commercial, military and business
aircrafts. It has always been one of
Brazil’s top three exporters.
Worldwide, EMBRAER is the third-
biggest airline manufacturer after
Boeing and Airbus for the number of
staff and the amount of aircraft
delivered annually. The company has
its headquarters in São José dos
Campos in São Paulo where its main
factory and centre for design and
engineering are also located.
On 31 May 2005, EMBRAER

announced plans for two new aircraft,
the Phenom 100 and 300, oriented
towards the business aviation market.
The new models are intended to
complement the existing offer of the
Legacy 600 in the segments of light
and very light aircraft. In addition, the
company announced in May 2006 the
forthcoming commercialization of an
executive version of its jet E-190 known
as Lineage 1000. The first two aircraft
were delivered in December 2008.

One-third (37%) of the papers written by Brazilians on
biotechnology in the period under review were written in
collaboration with scientists from other countries. Of the
total, 83% is accounted for by five countries: almost half
(47.6%) are publications in collaboration with the USA,
while between 11.0% and 6.5% are produced in
collaboration with France, the UK, Germany and Canada.
Meanwhile, 48% of Argentina’s total production in this field
results from collaborative work with other countries: the
USA accounts for 34%, whereas Spain, Brazil, France and
Germany account for between 17% and 10% each.

As regards patents, the WIPO database lists, through  
the PCT, 73 231 patent filings on biotechnology
within the period 2000–2007. Two hundred and thirty
patents are held by Latin Americans from 11 countries.
Of these countries, only three owned patents for
each year during the said period: Brazil (82),               
Cuba (55), a protectionist country in terms of inventions
which fosters patenting over publication, and
Mexico (51). Argentina held 15 patents throughout
this period, showing significant growth over the last
two years.

Box 5: Argentina’s technological showcase: the case of INVAP

INVAP is an enterprise that has
excelled in the field of nuclear, space
and industrial development over the
past 30 years. It was founded in 1976
as a joint venture between the
National Atomic Energy Commission
and the government of the Province
of Rio Negro. It is an exceptional case
in the region, as it is a leading
international supplier for the global
nuclear and satellite technology
market. Run like a private enterprise,
INVAP has attained a high level of
sophistication in technological
development equivalent to that of
enterprises from most developed
countries. 

INVAP is also a shining example of

co-ordination between the public
and private sectors. Emerging initially
as a spin-off of the Argentine National
Commission for Atomic Energy, the
enterprise is a reflection of a policy for
training highly qualified personnel
which has been sustained over time
by the Rio Negro government. At the
same time, INVAP is the living proof
that a national technology producer
can find a place in the global market.
Most notably in the field of nuclear
energy, the firm has positioned itself
as a supplier to various emerging

economies, although sales to
countries with greater relative
development have also been
recorded. 

INVAP did not take long to
become an exporter of nuclear
technology. By the early 1980s, it had
sold equipment and systems to
Romania, India and Peru. The most
noteworthy exports in the
enterprise’s history have been,
however, those of research reactors.
INVAP has built this type of
equipment in Peru (1978), Algeria
(1985), Egypt (1995) and Australia
(2000). Construction of the reactor in
Peru constituted a strategic decision
that would ultimately make
Argentina an exporting country for
this type of technology. This initial
step enabled the enterprise to
accumulate extensive skills that have
favoured its growing integration in
foreign markets, driven by an
aggressive export policy that has
been sustained ever since. 

In parallel, the enterprise has
developed capacities in nuclear
medicine. INVAP develops and
manufactures equipment and
accessories for radiotherapy and
related areas, in addition to offering

consultancies and other services for
the development and operation of
radiotherapy. The enterprise has
exported equipment to Venezuela,
Syria, India, Egypt, Brazil and Cuba. 
In a more recent development,

INVAP has ventured into the
construction of space satellites.
In co-operation with the National
Space Activities Commission
(Comisión Nacional de Actividades
Espaciales, CONAE), the enterprise has
to date designed and built three
Scientific Applications Satellites that
are still in operation. The space
agencies of the USA, France, Italy,
Denmark and Brazil have all used
these satellites to install their own
apparatus and services, and other
countries have expressed interest in
adding their own. Thanks to this work,
INVAP has become the pivot for co-
ordination between Argentinian
space and nuclear networks.

In sum, the region is brimming with opportunities to
develop biotechnology. Several groups are currently
working in this field, in tandem with groups which are
world leaders. Several successful examples, such as the
cloning of calves in Brazil and Argentina at the turn of the
century, illustrate the region’s potential in this field.

Technological development 
Despite the fact that many of the plans drawn up by S&T
agencies have not translated into effective improvements in
productivity, many Latin American countries have

succeeded in developing major technologies. This has been
achieved either as a result of stakeholder interest or strategic
decisions sustained by successive governments over time in
the form of state policies. The most outstanding examples of
stakeholder interest relate to technological capacities
acquired initially to serve the military but which were
subsequently adapted by economic interests for peaceful
applications. Both the Brazilian aeronautics industry and
Argentine nuclear technology are worthy of mention 
(Boxes 4 and 5). In the field of ICTs, Costa Rica’s policy has
been exemplary (Box 6).

Box 6: ICTs in Costa Rica

With a population of just 4 million,
Costa Rica has managed to position
itself in recent years as a leading
producer of information technology
(IT) in the region. One milestone was
the arrival of Intel in 1998. Other high-
tech multinational companies like
Hewlett-Packard and IBM soon
followed suit. The arrival of these
firms, along with the creation of
similar domestic firms, has generated
around 100 000 jobs. 

The IT enterprises of Costa Rican
origin are mainly based on software
production. According to a 2005
survey, these enterprises devote as
much as 12% of their budget to R&D.
However, the same survey reveals a
lack of linkages between firms and
universities. Most R&D-allocated
funds come from the enterprises
themselves. Other funding sources –

such as universities, international
organizations and foundations –
appear to be marginal. 

Costa Rican IT development has
been oriented towards exports. The
country is currently the region’s main
high-tech exporter to the USA and its
products also reach the markets of
Mexico and other Central and South
America countries. However, the
Costa Rican IT industry does not owe
its competitiveness to either exports
or low labour costs but rather to its
highly qualified workforce, the
product of education policies
sustained for decades. Almost all
professionals in the sector hold a
university degree, even if the
proportion of professionals with a
master’s degree or PhD is relatively
low. In addition, the country has
deliberately avoided attracting cheap

labour-intensive industries to its
shores, thereby providing a safeguard
against competitors offering lower
costs. 

In parallel, there is a transparent,

predictable system in place for
attracting foreign direct investment.
This favours the establishment of
international firms on Costa Rican soil.
The country has also been able to
project an image of stability and
democracy. These factors are
complemented by natural assets:
the country enjoys a favourable
geographical position, with ports on
both the Atlantic and Pacific oceans,
and a capital that is only a two-hour
flight from Miami in the USA.

TRENDS IN SCIENTIFIC CO-OPERATION

The Mercado Común del Sur, or MERCOSUR, groups five
countries: Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay and
Venezuela. At the time of its founding in 1991, there were
only four members. They were joined by Venezuela in 2007.

In 2005, the MERCOSUR adopted the Science, Technology
and Innovation Framework Programme for 2006–2010, 
to promote the advancement of knowledge in strategic
areas, including scientific knowledge of natural resources.
This framework programme established four
programmatic goals. The first relates to the ‘strategic
dimension of some research fields and includes STI
activities to address adequately the challenges facing the
region and its particularities. The issues to be considered
in this area relate to advanced and alternative energy
(hydrocarbons, hydraulic, nuclear and biomass energy),
sustainable development (non-renewable natural
resources, urban development, sanitation, etc.), ICTs,
biotechnology, nanotechnology and new materials. 

We can see from the foregoing that explicit R&D policies
formulated by those Latin American countries with
greater capacities in S&T have in common that they
tend to be aligned on major world trends with
economic goals, particularly investment in
biotechnology and nanotechnology. They give little
priority to social issues and emphasize some advanced
fields, such as nanotechnology and biotechnology, 
in accordance with the economic relevance of both.
However, it is worth questioning whether the
magnitude of the effort being made will suffice to bring
about major achievements. Some common activities,
however, have been developed in biotechnology and
information society technologies, with the financial
support of the European Union. 

Latin American countries have grasped the importance 
of internationalizing R&D. In many countries, programmes
have been put in place to promote international 
co-operation in R&D as well as programmes for co-operation
in specific areas, such as energy, biotechnology and ICTs.

Latin America

Almost all Latin American countries are linked to one
another through bilateral co-operation agreements which
include horizontal co-operation mechanisms in S&T. One
example is the Argentinian–Brazilian Biotechnology Centre
(CABBIO), which dates from 1987. It co-ordinates a network
of biotechnology research groups that implement
binational projects. High-level training is also dispensed via
the Argentinian–Brazilian Biotechnology School (EABBIO)
run by CABBIO (UNESCO, 2010). The South American
Programme for the Support of Co-operative Activities in
Science and Technology (PROSUL) was created, at Brazil’s
initiative, in 2001. The idea behind it was for a common
platform to be established for regional initiatives supported
by the programme. In future, the platform will favour the
development of projects of common interest that could be
submitted to national and multilateral fora dedicated to the
promotion of R&D. (For details of other Brazilian initiatives,
see page 117.)

Another experience worth mentioning is the Andrés Bello
Agreement, 4 the secretariat (SECAB) for which administers
a forum for co-operation in STI. In the private sector, the
impact of the Latin American Association of Technological
Management (ALTEC) is noteworthy.5

International organizations have actively promoted 
co-operation in STI in Latin America, particularly UNESCO and
the Organization of American States. Other international
bodies have played a prominent role in their capacity as a
factory of ideas for development strategies. These include the
United Nations Industrial Development Organization
(UNIDO), the United Nations Development Programme
(UNDP), the Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO) and
the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America
and the Caribbean (ECLAC). Last but not least, it is important
to mention the pivotal role played by the InterAmerican
Development Bank (IDB) in financing the development of
R&D activities and infrastructure in the region. Over the past
20 years, the IDB has disbursed hundreds of billions of dollars
in loans to several Latin American countries for the purpose 
of strengthening their S&T capacities. To a lesser extent, the
World Bank has also contributed to the financing of S&T
policy-making. It has also had an influence on the
re-engineering or redesigning of institutions.

Latin America’s co-operation with the European Union in
the field of STI has developed along two avenues since the
Interregional Framework Co-operation Agreement
between the European Community and Mercosur was
signed in 1999: participation in the European Union’s
six-year framework programmes for research and
technological development, and co-operation specifically
oriented towards specific issues defined by the European
Commission. One example is BIOTECSUR, a biotechnology
platform that is part of the Biotech MERCOSUR European
Union project resulting from an agreement signed in
November 2005 by the European Community and
MERCOSUR (UNESCO, 2010). The homogeneity of the
instruments implemented has gradually given rise to 
co-operation agreements involving several countries and,
subsequently, to ‘block to block’ agreements like that
entered into by the European Union and the MERCOSUR
in 2010 for a political and trade association. 

Currently, there is a slew of instruments available for Latin
American co-operation in S&T, among which the
Ibero-American Programme of Science and Technology for
Development (CYTED) has occupied a prominent position
since 1984. The purpose of CYTED is to promote a culture
of co-operation as a strategic tool for improving and
supplementing domestic capabilities, for internationalizing
domestic innovation systems, contributing to institutional
modernization and fostering the development of a Latin
American scientific community. 

The Organization of Ibero-American States,6 with its
Science, Technology and Society programme, has also
played a key role in orienting Latin American S&T towards
the goals of social cohesion and citizen empowerment.
More recently, The Latin American Knowledge Pool created
in 2005 within the framework of the Latin American
summits of heads of state and government, offers an
opportunity to achieve this convergence and meet the
challenges outlined above. In this context, new instruments
are being defined. One example is the Centro de Altos
Estudios Universitarios (Centre for Advanced University
Studies), which aspires to foster the creation of
postgraduate networks among Ibero-American 
universities.

UNESCO SCIENCE REPORT 2010

CONCLUSION

Latin American countries were inspired by the idea of
using S&T as an instrument for development in the
decades following the Second World War. They had made
some remarkable achievements by the 1970s, only for
these efforts to be frustrated in later decades by the rise 
of rigidly liberal policies. The desire to achieve
development through S&T did, however, find a favourable
terrain in the early years of the 21st century and these
conditions prevailed until the current global economic
recession. Between 2002 and 2008 when the recession 
hit, a prosperous cycle of the global economy had
favoured a six-year expansion cycle in Latin America
which was the region’s longest and greatest since 1980.
This has placed Latin America in a stronger position to
weather the storm than in earlier times of economic
turbulence.

‘The current structural conditions are incomparably more
favourable than those in previous decades’, stated Viotti
(2008) just before the onset of the global recession.
Although he was referring to the Brazilian experience, the
statement is valid for most Latin American countries.
These conditions were:

I several years of stability, both in economic terms and in

the democratic process;

I an expanding domestic market as a result of stability

and recent social policies;

I energy demand that is under control in most Latin

American countries. Such is the case of Bolivia with its
large gas reserves, of Ecuador, with its new oil reserves,
and of Brazil, thanks to both the recent discovery of oil
fields and ethanol. Brazil has become a leader in
technology related to the production and use of
ethanol in combustion engines, a technology that also
contributes to reducing greenhouse gas emissions;

I a region that appears to be well-placed to benefit from
growing global demand for commodities, particularly
food, and from the resulting increase in the price of
commodities. 

Several Latin American countries have seized this
opportunity to implement an array of policies to foster
innovation and lay the groundwork for a new generation
of development policies. This is particularly true of Brazil,
Chile, Argentina and Mexico, as well as smaller countries
such as Colombia, Costa Rica and Panama. 

98

However, big hurdles remain. The global economic
recession has generated an employment crisis that
threatens to exacerbate poverty in the region. There is a
predominant tension in the labour world between the
demand for better wages and the demand for maintaining
jobs, with each impinging on the other. The social crisis
remains acute in the region. The International Monetary
Fund estimates that poverty will grow by 15% in 2009. 
In this context, countries urgently need to expand their
policies for social development, inclusion and citizenship.
Institutions responsable for S&T policy have a role to play
in this regard.

Some authors consider that Brazil has progressed over the
past decade towards a more adequate institutional
structure for fostering innovation, having drawn on the
experiences of others (Arruda et al., 2006). In their opinion,
Brazil now possesses a broad set of instruments similar to
those available in developed countries. They admit,
however, that there is room for improvement as far as the
country’s legal framework is concerned, as gaps remain.
It is true that Brazil has a panoply of new instruments
inspired by international practices at its disposal, not to
mention vast resources for supporting innovation and
business R&D.

Most Latin American countries have gone down a similar
path. As we have seen earlier, there are now about
30 different types of S&T policy instruments in the region.
These instruments cover the full spectrum, ranging from
support for basic research according to criteria for
excellence to encouraging entrepreneurial innovation
(Emiliozzi, 2009; Lemarchand, 2009). However, most of
these sophisticated instruments will not suffice in and of
themselves to inverse trends overnight. Despite all the
advances in conceptual frameworks and the diversification
of instruments, the constitution of national innovation
systems remains incipient in every country of the region. 

R&D and innovation policies were initially designed
according to the science-push model, to later be dubbed
the linear model. This model still predominates in Latin
America, in spite of the aforementioned attempts by the
most advanced countries in the region to instigate
demand-pull and innovation policies. In the mid-1990s,
Bell (1995) described this feature as the survival of
conceptual frameworks dating from the 1960s to address
the challenges of the 1990s. Today, this phenomenon
persists even in those countries that tend to be the most

Latin America chapter [14] [P3]:Layout 1  18/10/10  18:11  Page 99

advanced for the adoption of innovation policies, such as
Brazil or Chile. Viotti (2008) admits that, even in his own
country, Brazil, the old culture still prevails, despite the
new set of policy instruments. Consequently, businesses
are reduced to playing the role of users or consumers of
the knowledge produced by R&D institutions, even if this
knowledge was created with no regard for the actual
needs of users.

It is the academic sector which is the most dynamic actor in
creating innovation systems in Latin America. Even the
design of promotional policies for fostering innovation in
the productive sector is the work of academics. Little
progress has been made towards fixing an agenda for new
industrial and technological policies. As a result, most Latin
American countries share the common feature that local
knowledge is underutilized by productive sectors that have
little demand for it, resulting in a lack of articulation
between the innovation process and academic knowledge.
Indeed, in many cases, both sectors remain in ignorance of
one other and are even reluctant to engage in joint activities
of potential mutual benefit. The region demonstrates a
paradox in that countries possess an acceptable scientific
sector in various disciplinary fields which produces valuable
knowledge that is potentially applicable to the productive
sector, yet their economies demand very little local
knowledge and are scarcely innovative. This is poles apart
from what happens in other regions. It is even contrary to
the path followed by Asian countries, whose economies
have benefited from appropriating knowledge produced
elsewhere to compensate for the lack of a well-developed
academic sector of their own.

In addition to the lack of linkages between actors of the
innovation system, with the exception of a handful of
sectoral clusters, the institutional structure is precarious in
Latin America. In some cases, there are heavy, inefficient
bureaucracies. In Brazil, for instance, duties related to
public policy management for industrial development
and S&T have been delegated to non-governmental
organizations; these have a complex institutional
structure and lack the political, technical and operational
capacity to exercise such duties effectively. 

In conclusion, some of the problem areas of S&T policy
pinpointed in reports are the following:

I There are difficulties in integrating and implementing

the existing policy instruments.

Latin America

I There is inadequate co-ordination, not only as far as

the instruments themselves are concerned but also on
the part of the institutions responsable for
implementing them.

I The allocation of resources is fragmented and thus

incapable of fostering critical changes in the
innovation process.

I Investment in R&D remains very low. Even in those

fields which demand advanced knowledge and skills,
such as biotechnology and nanotechnology, greater
resources are needed to achieve a critical mass. 

I In a region with persistent social problems where much
of the population is deprived of basic social benefits, it
is often difficult to establish ties between S&T policies,
on the one hand, and social policies, on the other. For
instance, health-related R&D is often separated from
general research policies. Moreover, there are
conceptual difficulties in linking R&D policies with
social inclusion policies.

I The problem of training and retaining a critical mass of

highly skilled personnel is a growing concern for
governments in the region. In order to address this
issue, some governments have implemented policies
to modernize the university system, combined with
measures to staunch brain drain and take advantage of
the human scientific capital scattered around the world.

INTRODUCTION

Brazil is the largest and most populous country in Latin
America, with an estimated 190 million inhabitants.
It is also the ninth-largest country in the world in terms 
of purchasing power and an emerging economy on the
world scene. If the global economic recession triggered 
by the subprime crisis in the USA in 2008 slowed down
business spending on research and development (R&D)
somewhat in 2009, there was no noticeable decrease in
the government sector. The impact of the global
economic recession seems to be already over in Brazil,
with the economy expected to grow by 7% in 2010.
Federal and state government ﬁscal revenues are up
again, as is R&D expenditure.

Like other Latin American countries, Brazil enjoyed strong
economic growth between 2002 and 2008, thanks largely
to a favourable global commodities market. The election
of a new president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (known as
Lula), slowed the momentum somewhat during the
federal government’s transition period in 2003 but, after
2004, the Brazilian economy embarked on what seems to
be a sustainable path of economic growth, with rates
averaging 4.7% per year. In parallel, both the business
sector and the federal and state governments began
increasing R&D expenditure. This did not reﬂect a change
in priorities on the part of the federal government,
however, as witnessed by the constant ratio between R&D
expenditure and federal ﬁscal revenue between 2001 and
2008 (2.1%). Between 2002 and 2008, the intensity of
gross domestic expenditure on R&D (GERD) increased by
just 10%, from 0.98% to 1.09% of GDP. Over the same
period, GDP grew by as much as 27%, from R$ 2.4 trillion
to R$ 3.0 trillion1. In other words, Brazil’s R&D intensity
progressed more slowly than the economy as a whole.
President Lula promised to raise the GERD/GDP ratio to
2.0% by the end of his ﬁrst mandate in 2006 when he
presided the ﬁrst meeting of the Science and Technology
Council in 2003 and in his message to Congress the same
year. In 2007, when R&D expenditure stood at 1.07% of
GDP, the federal government announced plans to raise the
GERD/GDP ratio to 1.5% by 2010. This target features in
the Plan of Action in Science, Technology and Innovation for
Brazilian Development, adopted in 2007. 

Thanks to sustained economic growth in recent years, the
US$ 23 billion2  spent on R&D in 2008 compares well with
investment levels in Spain (US$20 billion) and Italy 
(US$ 22 billion) in absolute value. We shall see later, however,
that Brazil nevertheless lags behind both countries when it
comes to translating R&D investment into results.

One important feature of GERD in Brazil is that the public
sector shoulders most of the burden (55%), a
phenomenon common to almost all developing countries.
Approximately three-quarters of scientists continue to
work in the academic sector. Brazilian scientists published
26 482 scientiﬁc articles in journals indexed in Thomson
Reuter’s Science Citation Index in 2008, making the
country the 13th largest producer of science in the world.
More than 90% of these articles were generated by public
universities. 

The business sector is also dynamic, however, and in
recent years has developed some world-class industries.
Brazil is self-suﬃcient in oil and can boast of having
developed the world’s most eﬃcient systems for growing
soybean and producing ethanol from sugarcane. It
manufactures competitive commuter jet planes and the
world’s best ﬂex-fuel cars. The business sector has also
developed a national system of electronic voting that is
capable of totalizing more than 100 million votes on
election day. Despite these achievements, the Brazilian
business sector registered only 103 patents at the United
States Patents and Trademark Oﬃce (USPTO) in 2009. 
We shall see why in the following pages.

Although business leaders have long recognized the
importance of creating knowledge to drive
competitiveness, it is only in the past ten years that
eﬀective policies have been put in place to foster
industrial and service-sector R&D. It was in 1999, after a
long period during which the focus was almost exclusively
on academic research, that Brazilian science and
technology (S&T) policy started including business R&D as
a progressively relevant target not only for the use of
knowledge but also for its creation. This was followed by a
series of milestones, beginning with the creation of the
ﬁrst sectoral funds in 1999 then the validation of the
entire strategy in 2001 by the Second National Conference
on Science, Technology and Innovation and culminating

UNESCO SCIENCE REPORT 2010

in the Innovation Bill prepared for Parliament in 2002 and
approved in 2004. In 2003, there was an important
development with the announcement of the national
Innovation, Technology and Trade Policy (PITCE). PITCE
connected innovation policy to the objectives for exports
and established priority areas for government action,
namely: semiconductors and microelectronics; software;
capital goods; pharmaceuticals and medication;
biotechnology; nanotechnology; and biomass. Four years
later, the federal government announced its Plan of Action
in Science, Technology and Innovation for Brazilian
Development to 2010.

The booming economy has been conducive to business
investment in R&D. However, despite a much more clement
environment for R&D since 2004, some barriers remain in
place. These include the diﬃcult access to capital owing to
high interest rates, poor logistics which hamper exports
and an inadequate education system which penalizes not
only social development but also the availability of
qualiﬁed workers for almost all positions, especially those
related to engineering. 

Brazil’s S&T capacity has come a long way, however, since
the National Research Council (CNPq) and a second federal
agency, Co-ordination for Training Higher Education
Personnel (CAPES), were set up in the 1950s, followed by
the São Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP) in 1962. 
The early 1960s also saw the State of São Paulo make the
landmark decision to step up academic research by
creating the Full-time Regime for faculty to give professors
ample time to do research. Scientiﬁc endeavour is less than
a century old in Brazil. Even today, development tends to be
concentrated in the country’s south and southeast regions,
home to the seven main universities, those of São Paulo
(USP), Campinas (Unicamp), the State of São Paulo (UNESP),
Minas Gerais (UFMG), Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS), Rio de
Janeiro (UFRJ) and the Federal University of São Paulo, all
just half a century old.

Brazil thus faces three major challenges. Firstly, it needs to
intensify business R&D, in order to drive innovation and
competitivity. This requires creating an environment
conducive to business R&D, including by encouraging
greater interaction between the public and business
research communities. Secondly, it needs to develop and
internationalize its best universities to turn them into
world-class centres of excellence. Thirdly, it needs to spread
scientiﬁc excellence beyond São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and

104

other major urban centres to less privileged regions, such
as the Amazon and the Northeast.

In the following pages, we shall analyse the shift in
government S&T policy since 1999 from a quasi-exclusive
orientation towards academic research to a policy of
strengthening the role of business R&D. We shall describe
the institutions that make up Brazil’s innovation system, its
demographics and investment pattern, heavily weighted
towards the public sector. We shall then analyse Brazil’s
scientiﬁc productivity in terms of publications, patents,
products and trade balance before concluding with a
study of recent trends in international collaboration,
including the emergence of new partners. We shall leave
for last the discussion of the current policy environment,
as most of the eﬀects of the Plan of Action in Science,
Technology and Innovation for Brazilian Development are
yet to be reﬂected in the data.

R&D INPUT

Trends in R&D expenditure
Between 2000 and 2008, GERD in Brasil grew, in constant
2008 values, by 28% from R$ 25.5 billion to R$ 32.8 billion.
The GERD/GDP ratio progressed more modestly, 
from 1.02 to 1.09% of GDP (Figure 1). 

Public R&D expenditure increased for almost every socio-
economic objective between 2000 and 2008 (Figure 2). The
exceptions were defence, energy, space and the exploration
of Earth and the atmosphere. However, even some of those
sectors which beneﬁted from a monetary increase saw their
‘priority status’ diminish over this period. This was notably
the case of agriculture, which represented 12% of the total
public budget in 2000 but just 10% eight years later, a drop
of 17%. Energy also saw its share whittled down by 41%,

from 2% to 1% of the total budget. Although social
development and services received a boost, this remained a
fairly low R&D priority in 2008. Greater priority was also
accorded in 2008 to infrastructure. In the case of industrial
technology, the observed increase is in line with the stated
objectives of S&T policies adopted since 1999, including the
Plan of Action in Science, Technology and Innovation for
Brazilian Development (2007–2010) discussed on page 118.
However, the statistics for energy and space are at odds with
the declared priorities of the Plan. The lower priority
accorded agriculture should be especially troubling,
considering the economic relevance of this sector for Brazil. 

Public R&D expenditure is mostly directed towards
academic R&D in Brazil, where it funds graduate
school-related research and public research institutions to 
a large extent (Table 1).

UNESCO SCIENCE REPORT 2010

At 1.09% of GDP (2008), Brazil’s R&D intensity exceeds
Latin American standards but lags well behind the
average (2.28%) for the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development (OECD) and European
Union (1.77%). In 2008, 55% of GERD was provided by the
public sector, either through direct government
spending or through expenditure on higher education.
This puts the level of public investment in R&D at 0.59%
of GDP. Some 45% of GERD thus comes from the private
sector, a share that has remained stable over the past
decade, compared to 69% for OECD countries and 65%
for the European Union (Figure 3). 

The diﬀerence in the share of GERD contributed by the
business sector in Brazil and OECD countries is striking.
Whereas non-business R&D expenditure in Brazil 
(0.59% of GDP) is only 15% less intense than the average
for OECD countries, the Brazilian share of business R&D
expenditure (0.48% of GDP) amounts to just 32% of the
OECD average. This gap exposes one of the main
challenges for the Brazilian national innovation system:
creating the requisite conditions for the share of business
R&D expenditure to increase by a factor of at least three
to reach an intensity comparable to the OECD average
and thereby maintain an adequate level of technical
competitiveness for industry.

The creation of sectoral funds
The most important innovation in federal R&D funding in
Brazil in the past 20 years has been the creation of the so-
called sectoral funds, enacted by law during 2000–2002
(InterAcademy Council, 2006, p.79). These sectoral funds
introduced targets for government-selected R&D projects
of beneﬁt to industry and cut back taxation to a fraction
of the revenue of certain industries earmarked for
privatization over this period. 

The concept of sectoral funds sprang from the
recognition that many of the state-owned companies
due to be privatized were strong in R&D, mostly in the
ﬁelds of telecommunications and energy, and that these
activities deserved not only to be protected but also
intensiﬁed. The sectoral fund model was created for
Ronaldo Sardenberg, Minister of Science and Technology
at the time, by the ministry’s Executive Secretary, Carlos
Pacheco. The sectoral funds would turn out to be a great
success. Rather than creating any new tax, they redirected
existing taxation and related contributions which were
already part of the country’s privatization strategy.

Brazil

In recognition of the heterogeneity of Brazil and its R&D
system, the legislation passed between 1999 and 2002
speciﬁed that no less than 30% of the value of each
sectoral fund was to be used to develop those regions
with weaker R&D activities, namely the North, Northeast
and Central West of Brazil.

The ﬁrst sectoral fund was that created for oil and natural
gas in 1999 (Table 2). Thirteen others followed over the
next three years. Two of these 15 sectoral funds are
unrelated to speciﬁc industries, namely:

I the R&D Infrastructure Fund is ﬁnanced by a 20%

contribution from each of the other funds and focuses
on developing academic R&D infrastructure;

I the Green–Yellow Fund – a reference to the national
colours of Brazil – is funded via 33% of the taxes paid
by corporations that send funds abroad for technical
assistance, royalties and specialized technical and
professional services, plus (nominally) 43% of the
recovered taxes from a progressively decreasing tax
exemption awarded to the information technology (IT)
industry to foster its development.

Each fund has a steering committee composed of
members from academia, government and industry. This
committee makes all decisions regarding expenditure,
usually keeping a portfolio of projects that are expected to
blend research proposals in the basic and applied sciences.
It also oversees investment to make sure the funds are
spent on projects related to the respective industry. 

The sectoral funds injected new money into R&D funding in
Brazil, even though the federal government continued to
conﬁscate a fraction of the industrial revenue due to the
funds in order to meet and exceed its ﬁscal surplus target.
After this practice ceased in 2008, the National Fund for
Scientiﬁc and Technological Development (FNDCT) reached
an all-time high the same year, with expenditure tipping 
PPP US$ 1.4 billion. Figure 4 shows the steep rise in FNDCT
expenditure after the creation of the ﬁrst Sectoral Fund for
Oil and Natural Gas in 1999 and another 13 sectoral funds in
the next three years.

State-level R&D expenditure

institutions of higher education. In 2008, about 32% of
public R&D expenditure originated from state funds.
Some states have strong R&D systems, the main one
being São Paulo where 64% of public R&D funding
comes from the state (Figure 5). 

The State of São Paulo generates 34% of Brazilian GDP
and it has a long tradition of supporting higher
education and research: the University of São Paulo
dates from 1934 and the São Paulo Research
Foundation was written into the State Constitution in
1947. Of all the states in Brazil, it is São Paulo which
receives the most funding from federal agencies,
normally 30–35% of the total. This is essentially because
the state supports three world-class public universities
which are among the 500 best in the world, according
to the Institute of Higher Education at Shanghai Jiao
Tong University, as well as the state-funded Foundation
for the Support of Research in São Paulo (FAPESP) which
has been operating since 1962. The state government’s
strong support makes São Paulo the second-biggest
spender on R&D in Latin America. This underscores the
relevance of regional R&D funding in a large federal
system like that of Brazil.

A sizeable portion of state investment in R&D comes
from state foundations whose mission is to support
research. These exist in almost all Brazilian states.
Besides FAPESP, the main ones are FAPEMIG in Minas
Gerais, FAPERJ in Rio de Janeiro, FAPERGS in Rio Grande
do Sul, FACEPE in Pernambuco, FAPECE in Ceará and
FAPESB in Bahia.

Business R&D expenditure
Of 95 301 companies polled in the Technological
Innovation Survey (PINTEC) conducted by the Brazilian
Institute for Geography and Statistics (IBGE) in 2005, only
6 168 reported having any type of R&D activities, permanent
or otherwise. The full sample corresponded to a total
revenue of US$1 097 billion. Of this, total R&D expenditure
was reported of US$ 9 368 billion. The biggest spenders
were the motor vehicle, trailers and semi-trailers industry
(16% of total expenditure) and oil reﬁning, ethanol and
nuclear fuel (9 % of the total).

An interesting feature of business spending on R&D relates
to the opportunities for attracting foreign direct investment.
In 2006, US majority-owned corporations invested 
US$ 571 million in R&D operations in Brazil, 185% more than
in 2001, according to the US Bureau of Economic Analysis. 

Tax incentives for business R&D
Four federal laws provide tax incentives for business R&D
(Table 3). Altogether, taxes waived in 2008 corresponded to
US$ 3 643 billion, or 37% of business R&D expenditure. 

Two other laws beneﬁt academic institutions mostly.
These laws have established an import tax waiver for
scientiﬁc equipment and materials. The 2005 law on tax
incentives for business R&D (Law 11196/05)3  is considered
by company representatives as being an improvement on
previous legislation, since it simpliﬁes the formalities
required to beneﬁt from these incentive measures.
Although the 1991 law on tax incentives for information
technology R&D (Law 8248/91) is used intensely by ﬁrms
in the IT sector, non-IT companies use Law 11196/05 to a
limited degree. 

An important criticism by the business sector of this
regime of incentives and subsidies is that there is an 
over-emphasis on the IT sector because of Law 8248/91.

3. In Brazil, laws do not bear names, only numerical references that include
the year of adoption.

Brazil

This regime is comparable in size to that of OECD
countries but, in point of fact, few sectors are entitled to
beneﬁt from it. The diﬃculty stems from the fact that the
IT incentive law is actually an internal equalization law to
compensate for non-R&D incentives oﬀered to IT
companies to encourage them to locate in Manaus, in the
Amazon (IEDI, 2010). Once the IT incentives are set aside,
the incentives cum subsidies regime corresponds to just
13% of business expenditure on R&D.

In addition to tax incentives, government purchasing
power through procurement is used in many countries
to foster innovation, especially in defense- and health-
related industries. This type of support for industrial R&D
is still very limited in Brazil even in defense and health
spending. The law on innovation of 2004 includes
articles designed to foster more intense use of
procurement. The government has come under
unrelenting pressure from representatives of industry to
adopt a more pro-active attitude in its procurement
policies (Box 1). 

Venture capital
The venture capital industry has grown in Brazil since the
economy stabilized in the mid-1990s. The National Bank
for Economic and Social Development (BNDES) has been
active in this market since 1995, whereas relevant

government initiatives date back to 1999. In 2000, the
Ministry of Science and Technology launched an initiative
called Inovar, led by the Brazilian Innovation Agency
(FINEP), a federal agency with some investment bank-like
attributes. The market responded well to this initiative
and several venture fora were subsequently organized to
present companies to potential investors. In 2005, BNDES
announced the bank’s return to venture operations, via a
fund of approximately U$ 150 million for investment in
partnerships to capitalize private funds. Legislation
enacted on 15 February 2006 in a provisional decree
known as Executive MP, or Executive Order, substantially
reduced the tax burden on revenue from venture funds
for foreign investors. However, most investment in
venture funds tends to target ‘non-technology-based’
industries. A 2003 report concluded that 86% of
venture operations in Brazil targeted these ‘non-
technology’ sector industries (ABCR and Thomson
Venture Economics, 2003).

Trends in R&D personnel
A shortage of PhDs
Although Brazil has managed to increase the number of
doctorates granted each year to 10 711 in 2008, the
country still faces a shortage, especially in engineering.
The number of graduates may seem high but this
translates into just 4.6 doctorates per 100 000 inhabitants,

UNESCO SCIENCE REPORT 2010

Box 1: Procurement policies to develop essential vaccines

Public buying policies are one of the
mechanisms used globally to
promote both science and the social
appropriation of knowledge. The
Brazilian vaccination and
procurement policies have had a
major impact over the last decade on
both basic research and vaccine
production. These policies promote
immunobiological self-sufficiency
and universal access to vaccines that
are provided free of charge. Two
centennial public institutions, the
Butantan Institute and Oswaldo Cruz
Institute, have built parallel research,
development and vaccine production
facilities that allow Brazil to be
competitive both scientifically and
technologically in the field. 

The legal framework responsible
for stimulating vaccine production by
these twin institutions is based on
Article 24 of Law 8666 of June 1993.
This article regulates Article 37, 
Item XXI, of the Federal Constitution
and institutes norms for the bidding
process and award of contracts by
the public administration, among
other measures. Article 24 states that
bidding in the procurement process
may be dispensed with if a public
entity acquires goods or services from

another entity or body belonging to
the public administration, as long as
these goods or services were created
for this specific purpose prior to the
enactment of Law 8666 and
providing that the contract price is
compatible with the market price.
This decision incited both the
Butantan and Oswaldo Cruz Institutes
to develop pilot plants for vaccine
production, with the Ministry of
Health as their key partner. The
ministry played a vital role, as it
guaranteed the institutes a main
buyer and minimal threshold for
production. It was evident, however,
that these facilities would need to be
accompanied by a parallel expansion
of vaccine-related basic science. 

Making a full scientometric

analysis of progress in this area of
basic science is a tricky exercise, since
many biological fields are vaccine-
related. Notwithstanding this, a
search for publications produced in
Brazil using ‘vaccine’ as a topic reveals
that, over the past five years, the
contribution of related basic sciences
in Brazil has jumped from a 2% share
of world literature to a 3% share. 
More importantly, the two vaccine
producers, Butantan and Oswaldo

Cruz, have been responsible for about
30% of all scientific output in Brazil in
the field of vaccine development
since 2004. In 2009, the Butantan
Institute produced more than 
200 million doses of vaccines using
in-house technology, including those
for diptheria, tetanus and pertussis
(DTP), also known as whooping
cough, and for Hepatitis B. The same
year, Biomanguinhos, a manufacturing
facility associated with the Oswaldo
Cruz Institute, produced more than
170 million doses of vaccines for
yellow fever, Hemophilus influenza
type B and oral poliomielytis Sabin,
among others. 

Both the Butantan and Oswaldo

Cruz Institutes are developing
technology derived from in-house
basic science and actively pursuing
the launch of new state-of-the-art
vaccines for the Brazilian and export
markets via technology transfer
agreements with private companies.
Products in the pipeline from the
Butantan Institute include vaccines
for cell-culture rabies, dengue,
rotavirus and influenza.

a ratio 15% lower than in Germany and roughly one-third
that of the Republic of Korea (CAPES, 2005). At under-
graduate level, Brazil faces an enormous challenge, since
only 16% of youth aged 18–24 years were enrolled in
higher education in 2008. This percentage will have to
treble, if Brazil wishes to be on a par with the low end of
the scale for OECD countries. The country’s strategy so far
has been to expand the number of private institutions
oﬀering 4–5 year courses, in tandem with fostering
greater enrollment at public universities oﬀering courses
of the same duration. This strategy has not suﬃced,
however, to raise the enrollment rate to an internationally
competitive level.

Most Brazilian researchers are academics
The lion’s share of R&D is conducted by academic
institutions in Brazil, as conﬁrmed by the demographics
(Figures 6 and 7). In most cases, it is easier to obtain
precise information about the number of employees than
about R&D expenditure, especially in the private sector.
Researchers in Brazil occupy primarily full-time academic
positions: 57% are employed by universities and another
6% by research institutes. That leaves just 37% in the
business sector, which is consistent with the smaller
portion of private R&D expenditure compared to public
disbursements. The low number of scientists in the private
sector is not without repercussions, as witnessed by the

deﬁciency in patents generated by Brazilian industry. 
It is also one of the main obstacles to the development of
stronger university–industry ties. Moreover, only 15% of
Brazilian researchers in the business sector hold an MSc or
PhD. In the Republic of Korea, this percentage is 39%: 6%
hold a PhD and 33% an MSc. Government R&D funding
agencies like CNPq, FINEP, FAPESP and others have
created fellowship programmes for doctoral researchers in
industry but these have shown limited results.

R&D OUTPUT

Scientific publications
The number of scientiﬁc publications originating from
Brazil has grown steadily over the past 26 years,
culminating in 26 482 in 2008 (Figure 8). In parallel, Brazil’s
world share of articles has climbed from 0.8% in 1992 to
2.7% in 2008. There is a correlation between this increase
and the growing number of PhDs awarded annually.
Thanks to a consistently favourable policy for graduate
education over the past 50 years or more, the number of
PhD-holders has gone from 554 in 1981 to 10 711 in 2008.

Note: The evolution in scientific publications should inspire caution because the Thomson Reuters Web of Science changes the selection of journals
over time. Some growth may thus be due to the inclusion of new journals, especially in 2008.

Observatoire des sciences et des technologies, May 2010

The impact of articles originating from Brazil has also
grown: in 2000, there were 1.45 citations per article two
years after publication,4 compared to 2.05 citations for
articles published in 2007. Brazil’s presence has grown in
all the major ﬁelds of science but articles are most
common in agronomy and veterinary sciences (3.07% of
the world total), physics (2.04%), astronomy and space
science (1.89%), microbiology (1,89%) and plant and
animal sciences (1.87%)5. 

The existence of a burgeoning scientiﬁc community has
allowed special research programmes requiring a large
pool of researchers to develop. A good example is the
Genome Project implemented in São Paulo, which was the
ﬁrst to sequence the DNA of a phyopathogenic bacterium,
Xylella fastidiosa. This programme was run in partnership
with Fundecitrus (Citrus Producers Association). 

4. Data collected by the authors using the Thomson Reuters Web of
Science and counting those articles restricted to the category of ‘articles’
and citations recorded in the two years following publication

5. For a comparison with China and Índia, see Figure 8 on page 375.

In addition to producing advanced science, the Genome
Project contributed knowledge that enabled researchers
at Fundecitrus to devise ways of controlling a disease
which attacked orange trees, Citrus Variegated Chlorosis.
It also generated at least two spin-oﬀ companies in the
ﬁelds of genomics and bioinformatics. Another example is
the Biota Research Programme, one of the largest in the
world in the ﬁeld of biodiversity science (Box 2).

The data recorded in the Thomson Reuters database
do not tell the whole story about Brazilian productivity,
however. In developing countries, new knowledge
frequently ﬁnds its way into local journals that often
pass under the radar of Thomson Reuters’ Science
Citation Index, unless the journal has international
circulation, which is rarely the case. Moreover, the
language of most Brazilian scientiﬁc journals is
Portuguese rather than English, especially as concerns
articles in the humanities and applied social sciences. 
In order to enhance the visibility of Brazilian scientiﬁc
production, FAPESP and the Latin American and
Caribbean Center on Health Sciences Information

Box 2: Mapping biodiversity in São Paulo

Since 1998, a ‘virtual institute of
biodiversity’ by the name of Biota has
been mapping the biodiversity of the
State of São Paulo and defining
mechanisms for its conservation and
sustainable use. 

Being a virtual institute, it has no

physical premises – participating
researchers work in their own
departments anywhere in the State
of São Paulo. The 200 researchers and
500 graduate students who work for
the institute are employed as faculty
at 16 institutions offering higher
education and research. FAPESP has
thus avoided the risk of a major ‘turf
war’ between rival institutions
plaguing the programme. The virtual
institute also employs about 
80 collaborators from other Brazilian
states and approximately 50 from
abroad. Participation is open to
anyone with a sound project that has
survived the peer-review process
managed by FAPESP. 

In 11 years, the programme 
has supported 87 major research
projects with an annual budget of
approximately US$ 7.1 million.
During that time, the programme has
also trained 150 MSc and 90 PhD

students, uncovered and stored
information about approximately 
10 000 species and managed to
make data available from 35 major
biological collections. This has
translated into 464 published articles
published in 161 scientific journals,
16 books and two atlases. 

In 2001, the programme

launched an open-access electronic
peer-reviewed journal, Biota
Neotropica, to communicate original
research results on biodiversity in the
Neotropical region. The journal is
quickly becoming an international
reference in its field.

In 2002, the programme

launched a new venture called
BIOprospecTA, in order to search for
new compounds of economic
interest for pharmaceutical or
cosmetic applications. As a result,
three new drugs have been
submitted for patenting. 

The programme has also had a

considerable impact on public policy.
The government of the State of São
Paulo has drawn on the results of the
programme to issue four Governor
decrees and 11 resolutions concerning
conservation of areas in the state. 

In January 2009, for example, the state
government designated three large
coastal Areas for Environmental
Protection (APA Litoral Norte, APA
Litoral Centro, APA Litoral Sul). Over
the next ten years, the Biota–FAPESP
Programme may produce data to
improve management of these
protected areas. 

The international Scientific
Advisory Board responsible for
evaluating the programme has
stated that ‘science in most Biota
projects is of a high quality that is
either equivalent or exceeds that in
other countries and, in several
projects, it is of outstanding quality
and on the cutting edge of
international efforts’.

In 2009, the Biota programme

began preparing a draft Science Plan
and Strategies for the Next Decade,
based on the recommendations of a
workshop held in June the same year
on Establishing Goals and Priorities 
to 2020.

created an open access web portal in 1999, the Scientiﬁc
Electronic Library Online (Scielo). In 2009, Scielo oﬀered
access to 203 peer-reviewed journals, including titles
from Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Cuba, Spain,
Portugal and Venezuela.  The same year, the Scielo
website received 119 million visitors, who downloaded
15 759 articles.  See Figure 9 for a comparison of the
number of articles published in national journals in
2000 and 2008.

Most scientiﬁc production comes from public universities.
Just seven universities accounted for 60% of articles
published in international journals in 2009 (Table 4). 

Their share of the total increased from 60% in 2000 to 71%
in 2007 before falling back to 60% in 2009. The University
of São Paulo, with a full-time faculty of 4 670, produced
23% of the country’s science in 2009, followed by the
University of the State of São Paulo ( 2 889 full-time faculty)
and Unicamp (1 538 full-time faculty), both with 8%. 

Industrial and academic patents
In 2009, 103 utility patents for Brazilian inventions were
issued by the United States Patents and Trademark Oﬃce
(USPTO), almost the same number as ﬁve years previously
(106). This is a dismal count, given the size of the Brazilian
economy and its scientiﬁc infrastructure. Even if Brazil

outshines its Latin American neighbours for this indicator,
it is dwarfed by India (Figure 10).

The small number of scientists working in the business
sector directly aﬀects the number of patents originating
from Brazil, in the same way that dominant industrial
sectors and export coeﬃcients do. There may be a
correlation between these low patent ﬁgures and the level
of qualiﬁcation of researchers employed in the business
sector, given the small fraction with an advanced graduate
degree (see page 109). Another factor may be a lack of
audacity in the R&D objectives of most Brazilian
industries, stemming from decades of operating in a
closed market and an erratic economy. Changes in the
economic climate since the 1990s have created a more
open market, stronger competition and a stable
economy. In turn, this is changing attitudes in many
companies but the impact has not yet made itself felt in
terms of the quantity and quality of business R&D.

Academic patenting has been gaining momentum in
Brazil, especially since the feats of some institutions
gained country-wide visibility, such as those of Unicamp
and the Federal University of Minas Gerais. Unicamp has
been strong in patents for more than two decades and
has the largest stock of any Brazilian academic institution.
In the period 2000–2005, it was awarded the most patents
after Petrobrás, the Brazilian state-owned oil company. 
In 2002, the university founded the Unicamp Agency for
Innovation encompassing a Technology Transfer Oﬃce,
thereby demonstrating a strong penchant for licensing
and the generation of revenue from its intellectual

property. Moreover, most of these licenses are exclusive,
as in this case the licensee takes part in the development
of the intellectual property through a co-operative R&D
agreement.

Of the top 10 awardees of patents by the Brazilian Patent
Oﬃce (INPI) in the period 2000–2005, three were academic
institutions: Unicamp, FAPESP and the Federal University of
Minas Gerais. This seems to indicate two things: ﬁrstly, that
academic institutions have embraced the idea of
protecting their intellectual property and are seeking
opportunities to generate businesses with it;   and,
secondly, that eﬀorts by industry to generate intellectual
property remain ineﬀectual, since it is rare to ﬁnd
situations in which academic institutions generate more
patents than industry among industrialized economies.

Brazil

This said, very few research universities have, so far, been
able to make more money out of licensing than they
spend in the process (Mowery et al. 1999). The real
motivation for a university to license its intellectual
property should be in order to fulﬁll its mandate of
diﬀusing knowledge throughout society and creating
opportunities for its students. An exclusive ﬁxation on
ﬁnancial beneﬁts has thwarted many attempts by
Brazilian universities to transfer technology and purchase
it via licensing fees — and even attempts by R&D public
agencies. There is still a lot to be learned in Brazil about
the beneﬁts to society of generating new businesses via
excellent higher education, a sector in which Brazil has
already obtained some important successes. One example
is the Aeronautics Technology Institute, one of the best
engineering schools in Latin America, which gave rise to
the Brazilian Aeronautics Company (EMBRAER). 

SUCCESS STORIES IN INNOVATION

Brazil can boast of some extremely successful cases of
knowledge-based innovation. Take the example of jet
aircraft, a highly competitive product of Brazilian R&D.
Since being privatized in 1994 at a time of economic
crisis, EMBRAER has gone on to become the third-largest
aircraft manufacturer in the world. The ﬁrst units of the 
90-seater ERJ–190 have been ﬂying commercially since
early 2006 (see page 94). Moreover, a subsidiary of
EMBRAER, the Neiva Aeronautics Industry, has produced
the world’s ﬁrst alcohol-powered aircraft, the EMB 202
Ipanema. By 2006, Neiva had delivered more than 3 700
units, making the EMB 202 the most common agricultural
aircraft in Brazil.

The agribusiness sector has also obtained outstanding
results in both production and productivity. This sector
beneﬁts from public R&D investment via the Brazilian
Agricultural Research Corporation (EMBRAPA) and other
organizations within the national system of agricultural
R&D. Soybeans, oranges and coﬀee are important export
products, largely due to years of continual R&D.

Energy obtained from ethanol is another demonstration
of the country’s ability to create and use knowledge to
generate opportunities. The ProAlcool National
Programme (Alcohol Programme) launched in the 1970s is
the world’s most ambitious scheme today for using
ethanol fuel in automobiles (Box 3). In 2005, 50% of

Box 3: Bioenergy R&D in Brazil

Since the launch of the ProAlcool
National Programme in 1975,
industrial, government and academic
R&D have been making a considerable
contribution to the development of
the ethanol business in Brazil. A group
of well- established research
organizations like the Center for
Sugarcane Technology (CTC), the
Agronomical Institute of Campinas
(IAC) and the Network for Sugarcane
Improvement (Ridesa) have developed
a large number of new varieties that
have raised the average yield from 
50 to 85 tons per hectare. Industrial
R&D, often in association with
universities, has improved industrial
productivity from 55 to 80 litres of
ethanol per ton of sugarcane. It has
also obtained important results in the
treatment of industrial residues.

The recent surge in international
interest in bioenergy has intensified
research in this field in many
countries, causing Brazil to align its
own strategy on competing in global
markets. This strategy requires not
only more R&D but above all cutting-
edge R&D. Together with CTC and
Central Alcool, FAPESP embarked on
a project in 1999 to identify
expressed genes in sugarcane and in
functional genomics (SUCEST and
SUCEST-Fun) and train human
resources in this field. This effort
contributed to an increase in the
number of scientific articles about
sugarcane in Brazil.

Given the potential for a massive

scaling-up of production and the
competitivity of Brazilian sugarcane
ethanol, sustainability came to be an
essential element of increasing
productivity. In the past three years, 
a number of initiatives have been
launched in Brazil to harness

advanced science to sustainability
and productivity targets. For
instance, EMBRAPA, the state-owned
company for agricultural research,
has opened a division on agro-
energy.

In addition, a new research centre
was inaugurated in 2009, the Brazilian
Bioethanol Science and Technology
Laboratory (CTBE), in Campinas in the
State of São Paulo. CTBE has three
objectives: to perform competitive
R&D to improve crops and conversion
paths for bioethanol production from
sugarcane; to partner other research
organizations working in related
areas, through a network of
associated laboratories in universities
and research institutes and; to act as a
supplier of technology for the
industry, providing strategic
information of mutual concern.

A third initiative is the FAPESP

Programme for Research on
Bioenergy (BIOEN). BIOEN aims to
create linkages between public and
private R&D by using academic and
industrial laboratories to advance and
apply knowledge in fields related to
ethanol production in Brazil. The
BIOEN programme has five divisions:

I Sugarcane Plant Technologies,

including plant improvement and
sugarcane farming;

I Ethanol Industrial Technologies;

I Bio-refinery Technologies and

alcohol chemistry; 

I Otto Cycle Engines and Fuel Cells,

ethanol applications for motor
vehicles;

I Social and Economic Impact,

Environmental Studies, Land Use
and Intellectual Property.

The BIOEN Programme is well-
equipped to support exploratory
academic research on these topics
and train scientists and professionals in
essential areas for advancing the
ethanol industry’s capacities. 

On top of this, BIOEN establishes

partnerships co-funded by FAPESP
and industry for co-operative R&D
between industrial and academic
laboratories at universities and
research institutes. Other research
agencies from the federal government
and other state governments
participate in the programme. They
include CNPq and FAPEMIG. In 2009,
BIOEN contracted its first round of 
60 research projects.

A fourth initiative in progress in
mid-2010 is the establishment of the
São Paulo Bioenergy Research Center,
with hubs in the three São Paulo State
research universities (University of São
Paulo, Unicamp and UNESP). The
centre will set out to attract a greater
number of scientists in the field of
bioenergy to the three participating
universities and will receive funding
from FAPESP, the state government
and the universities themselves to the
tune of US$100 million over the next
ten years. 

In addition to these state or

federal initiatives, companies have also
stepped up their R&D efforts in
bioenergy. Petrobrás has a programme
on second-generation biofuels, which
use waste from crops, and large
companies such as Vale, Braskem and
Oxiteno are also conducting a lot of
bioenergy-related R&D.

automobiles sold in Brazil were of the ﬂex-fuel type
and, by January 2006, as much as 74%. On top of that,
the country adds 25% ethanol to gasoline to reduce
carbon emissions and import costs. Automakers in
Brazil have developed ﬂex-fuel systems that can use
from 0 to 100% of ethanol or gasoline. This
technology is the brainchild of Brazilian R&D teams
working in the country for foreign-owned auto-parts
and automobile manufacturers who have developed
a technology superior to that used anywhere else in
the world (Bueno, 2006; Lovins et al., 2009). In 2008,
Brazil was the world’s second-largest ethanol
producer (24.5 billion litres) after the USA, at a cost of
US$ 0.19 per gallon, less than half the world average
(US$ 0.40). Industry, government institutes and
universities have developed better varieties of
sugarcane and more eﬃcient planting and harvesting
methods, in tandem with more sophisticated ethanol
reﬁneries.

In each case, the main asset has been a stock of well-
educated personnel trained in institutions which
meet the world’s best academic standards. All of
these industries share another common feature: at
some point, each has depended on policies which
harnessed the government’s purchasing power to
stimulating technological development. The last
ingredient in this recipe for success has been a fruitful
public–private partnership to get the ideas to market.

One challenge the country has yet to overcome is
that of diﬀusing this experience and skill in
innovation through all sectors of industry. Years of a
closed market and economic instability have taken
their toll on attitudes towards innovation in the
business sector. The sector has, however, responded
quite well to incentive measures; during the 1990s
when the Brazilian economy began opening up to
the outside world, the federal government developed
a country-wide programme for improving the quality
of industrial products and processes that proved
highly successful. More recently, both the
government and leaders of industry have turned
their attention to technological innovation. As a
result, momentum has been building to develop this
important area. For example, the National
Confederation of Industry (CNI) initiated a Movement
for Business Innovation (MEI) in 2009 to woo business
leaders, a scheme that is already picking up speed.

Brazil

INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATION

Brazilian international scientiﬁc collaboration has been
steady for the past ﬁve years, according to Vanz (2009).
However, at 30%, the share of internationally co-authored
articles is substantially lower than the ﬁgure of 42%
reported by Glanzel (2001) for the period 1995–1996. 

US scientists are the main partners for Brazilians. A study
by Adams and King (2009) found that 11% of scientiﬁc
articles written by Brazilians between 2003 and 2007 had
at least one co-author in the USA and 3.5% a co-author
from the UK. Argentina, Mexico and Chile combined
represented just 3.2% of co-authors of Brazilian articles.

International scientiﬁc collaboration is supported by both
federal and state agencies via initiatives ranging from
individual scholarships to multilateral programmes.
CAPES, the main body responsible for supporting and
evaluating graduate programmes, has a diverse portfolio
of measures for ﬁnancing international collaboration. 
In 2008, CAPES granted 4 000 scholarships to Brazilian
graduate students abroad. CAPES also maintains bilateral
collaboration programmes with Argentina, Cuba, France,
Germany, the Netherlands, Portugal, Uruguay and the
USA. In 2009, more than 500 joint research projects were
ﬁnanced under these agreements.

Through the Department of International Collaboration
(ASCIN), the CNPq runs programmes ranging from
individual scholarships for foreigners to regional
programmes for scientiﬁc collaboration. Latin America
and Africa, one of Brazil’s priorities for regional
collaboration, beneﬁt from speciﬁc programmes: ProSul
and ProAfrica. Other CNPq programmes focus on speciﬁc
ﬁelds within a wider region. One example is the
InterAmerican Collaboration in Materials involving
Argentina, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Jamaica, Mexico,
Trinidad and Tobago, Peru and the USA. 

FAPESP itself has agreements for co-funding research with
agencies in Canada, France, Germany, Portugal, the UK
and USA. In fact, all the main Brazilian universities and
research organizations oﬀer services fostering
international collaboration in research6.

Brazilian scientists and organizations serve on the
governing bodies of the InterAcademy Panel,
InterAcademy Council, InterAmerican Network of
Academies of Science, International Council for Science,
Academy of Science for the Developing World and several
international disciplinary unions. Participation in these
decision-making bodies has helped to integrate Brazilian
science into global and local collaborative and large-scale
projects, while oﬀering Brazil’s scientiﬁc community
greater international exposure.

One example of a large-scale collaborative programme is
that for the Southern Astrophysical Research (SOAR)
Telescope commissioned in 2003. This 4.1-m aperture
telescope has been designed to produce the best-quality
images of any observatory in its class in the world. Funded
within a partnership involving primarily Brazil, Chile and
three US institutions, the National Optical Astronomy
Observatory, Michigan State University and the University
of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, SOAR is situated on Cerro
Pachón at an altitude of 2 700 m, on the western edge of
the peaks of the Chilean Andes. Brazilian participation in
this project has contributed signiﬁcantly to the growth of
the scientiﬁc community and resulted in a rise in Brazilian
publications in astronomy from 274 in 2000 to 404 in
2009. World-class instruments, such as an integral ﬁeld

spectrograph, have been designed and built in Brazil for
installation in the SOAR facility.

Brazilian scientists are also collaborating with their Chinese
counterparts on an ambitious project to develop and operate
remote–sensing satellites for Earth observation (Box 4).

Another important programme for international S&T
collaboration is led by the Brazilian Agricultural Research
Corporation (EMBRAPA). EMBRAPA has set up laboratories
in the USA, Netherlands, UK and Republic of Korea to
throw bridges to the most advanced research in the
world. EMBRAPA also has oﬃces in Senegal, Mozambique,
Mali and Ghana. These oﬃces are part of the EMBRAPA
Africa Programme, which strives to develop projects for
scientiﬁc co-operation. The oﬃces in Africa also interact
with governments and local bodies to oﬀer assistance in
deﬁning priorities, so that EMBRAPA laboratories in Brazil
can propose contributions that address local needs. 

AN ACTION PLAN FOR S&T

In 2007, the government presented a Plan of Action 
in Science, Technology and Innovation for Brazilian
Development for the period 2007–2010. 

Box 4: China and Brazil developing space technology together

The China–Brazil Earth Resources
Satellites (CBERS) programme
embraces a family of remote-sensing
satellites built jointly by Brazil and
China. This example of successful
South–South co-operation in high
technology currently includes five
satellites which provide coverage of
the world´s land areas. CBERS-1
functioned from October 1999 to July
2003, CBERS-2 from October 2003 to
June 2008 and CBERS-2B from
September 2007 to May 2010. CBERS-3
will be launched in 2011 and CBERS-4
in 2014. CBERS-3 and CBERS-4 are each
equipped with four cameras with
bands in visible, near-infrared, middle
and thermal infrared (see image 
page 102).  

Brazil and China share the

responsibility for, and cost of, building
the satellites. In Brazil, the National
Institute for Space Research (INPE)
designs half of the subsystems and
contracts them to the Brazilian space
industry. The Brazilian participation in
the programme amounts to a total
cost of about US$ 500 million, with
60% of investment taking the form of
industrial contracts. 

Data obtained from the CBERS

satellites are released within a free and
open data policy. From 2004 to 2010,
more than 1.5 million images were
delivered to users in Brazil, Latin
America and China. These images
have applications in forestry and
agriculture assessment, urban

management and geological
mapping. Brazil uses the images to
survey deforestation in Amazonia and
to assess land use associated with cash
crops such as sugarcane and soybeans
and with large-scale cattle ranching.

China and Brazil have agreed on a

joint strategy for facilitating
international access to remote-
sensing data in Africa. From 2012
onwards, African ground stations in
South Africa, the Canary Islands,
Egypt, and Gabon will receive and
freely share CBERS data. The CBERS
programme thus enables Brazil and
China to contribute to global
environmental policy-making.

The Plan is an important advance in that it groups most of
the federal initiatives in S&T in a single document. This
allows for a much better understanding and monitoring of
the federal S&T system and, hypothetically, for an
evaluation of the Plan’s implementation. The Plan has
been welcomed by the scientiﬁc community. 

The Plan does have its shortcomings, however. For one thing,
it fails to to integrate the various federal ministries that
should be involved in fostering science, technology and
innovation (STI). Federal initiatives are also poorly articulated
with those at state level. Moreover, in many cases, those
sectors deﬁned as being strategic actually received a smaller
share of funding in 2008 than in 2000, as we have seen in
Figure 2. This is the case of agriculture, energy and defence,
for example. Nor has the goal of raising GERD to 1.5% of GDP
by 2010 been attained. These shortcomings do not invalidate
the usefulness of the Plan, however. Overall, it has been a
positive initiative with most of its proposals being
implemented to some extent. These shortcomings will need
to be rectiﬁed, however, in future action plans.

The Plan has four thrusts:
■ To expand, integrate, modernize and consolidate the

national innovation system by improving co-ordination
at the federal, state and municipal levels, as well as
between these public entities and private enterprises.
The focus is on strategic areas for national development
and both the renewal and consolidation of international
co-operation. Another important goal is to increase the
number of scholarships and fellowships for under-
graduates, master’s and PhD students, postdoctoral
students and senior researchers from 102 000 in 2007 
to 170 000 by 2011.

■ To improve and promote technological innovation in

companies by nurturing an innovation-friendly
environment within ﬁrms and by strengthening
industrial, technological and export policies. The aim is
to generate employment, raise income and add value to
each stage of the production process. One priority is to
increase the number of active researchers in the private
sector while, in parallel, training human resources and
developing a ‘knowledge creation culture’ in enterprises.
Another goal is to create a structure for the Brazilian
Technology System (SIBRATEC). SIBRATEC is a group of
entities that helps companies across Brazil develop their
businesses by providing services that include
technology transfer and assistance. These services relate

Brazil

in particular to the Basic Industrial Technology (TIB)
programme7. One goal is to increase the number of
business incubators and technological parks. Another is
to permit the creation of self-governing innovative
enterprises.

■ To strengthen R&D in strategic areas that include

biotechnology, nanotechnology, agribusiness,
biodiversity and renewable sources of energy. Speciﬁc
goals are included for the nuclear, space, metrology,
national security and defence sectors. 

■ To promote science popularization and improve science

teaching, as well as technology diﬀusion for social
inclusion and development. Social development is a
major objective of current state policies. Key tools are the
Mathematics Olympiads for Public Schools launched in
2005, which attracted 18 million participants in 2008; the
promotion of National Science and Technology Week in
October each year; support for the establishment of
TeleCenters in rural areas to narrow the digital divide and
ﬁght poverty, a programme launched by the Ministry of
Communication in 2007, and; the programme oﬀering
Research and Development Support for Nutritional and
Food Security. The latter was launched in 2008 by
networking Research and Technological Institutes of Food
Sciences and now oﬀers information and consultancy
services to small and medium-sized enterprises, as well as
to individual farmers and food producers.

CONCLUSION

It is evident from the foregoing that Brazil has developed a
competitive academic base in science. Academia still faces a
number of challenges, however. Although the number of
scientiﬁc articles and doctorates granted annually has been
rising, there remains a lack of homogeneity in the regional
distribution of academic staﬀ and the country’s knowledge
base: 60% of all scientiﬁc articles originate from just seven
universities, four of which are in the State of São Paulo. There
is also a lack of homogeneity in disciplinary ﬁelds. Eﬀorts will
be required in engineering and computer science, for
example, to train more undergraduates and PhD-holders
and expand Brazil’s international presence. At the same time,
the advancement of knowledge in Brazil might beneﬁt from

7. This programme includes metrology, technical norms and standards,
conformity to standards, intellectual property and design.

a more balanced governmental approach between directed
and unfettered research. Recently, there has been a
seemingly excessive tendency to direct calls for projects
towards speciﬁc objectives. This penalizes curiosity-driven
research, the cornerstone of a strong academic system. 

Industrial R&D is in need of even greater attention than
academic research. It still suﬀers from a lack of government
support, even though the situation has improved radically
over the past eight years. Recent measures like the law on
innovation (2004) and its consequences, such as the
refurbishing of tax-incentive legislation and the introduction
of a policy of subsidies, are expected to have a big impact on
industrial R&D. These measures fall within the framework of
the national Industry, Technology and Trade Policy (PITCE)
adopted in 2003. The emergence of the National Bank for
Economic and Social Development (BNDES) as a funding
source for technological development and industrial R&D is,
possibly, the most important boost for industrial R&D in the
country for many years.

As we have seen, research funding comes mainly from the
public purse (55%). Brazil falls below the OECD average for
both its GERD/GDP ratio (1.09%) and the share of GERD
contributed by government (0.59%). To meet the OECD
average for public funding of R&D, Brazil would have to
invest an additional R$3.3 billion (PPP US$ 2.3 billion). This
amount corresponds to roughly three times the budget of
CNPq.

The largest gap of all with the OECD countries concerns
business spending on R&D. Here, the OECD average (1.58%
of GDP) is three times that of Brazil (0.48% of GDP). Catching
up to the OECD would entail the Herculean task of raising
private R&D expenditure from US$ 9.95 billion in 2008 to US$
33 billion. This challenge calls for much more eﬀective policy
instruments than those employed thus far by the Brazilian
state. Moreover, these must not be conﬁned to ﬁnancial
instruments, such as government subsidies, tax breaks and
procurement policies, but should also encompass the legal
and political instruments necessary to create an environment
conducive to private investment in R&D.

A ﬁnal note is in order here to address a question that comes
up frequently in political circles in Brazil, namely, ‘Why should
taxpayer money pay for R&D?’ As a tentative answer, we
would say that there are at least two equally valid
justiﬁcations for this. One is that contributing to the universal
pool of knowledge makes Brazilians more capable of

120

determining their own destiny. Like people everywhere,
Brazilians ask themselves, ‘How did the Universe begin?’ ‘How
does it work?’ ‘Why does society behave the way it does?’
‘What drives human beings towards good or evil?’
Understanding the classics of literature and appreciating
nature and art are part of what makes us human. Studying
these and an inﬁnite number of other questions enriches us.
This alone would be reason enough to use taxpayer money
to ﬁnd science-based answers – even incomplete ones – to
fundamental questions and thereby improve our knowledge
of the Universe and humankind. This endeavour is obviously
much more the sphere of universities than industry or the
private sector.

The other reason why taxpayer money should ﬁnance R&D
seems far more popular nowadays than the ﬁrst reason
evoked above: the more knowledge a society obtains by
employing the scientiﬁc method, the richer it becomes. This
utilitarian view has strong appeal, especially since the
discovery of the genome and atomic energy, and the
invention of the transistor and Internet. 

In our view, both reasons are complementary rather than
antagonistic, since both perceive science as a productive
force. This line of reasoning depends strongly on the capacity
of industry and other enterprises to improve Brazilians’
standard of living to make its case.

The challenge for Brazil will be to turn these dual reasons into
a functioning tandem by creating conditions under which
universities and private companies can, in the words of
Francis Bacon8, through ‘good and sound research’, make the
country a better place and a full member in the concert of
nations.

INTRODUCTION

The Republic of Cuba is an archipelago comprising a main
island and more than 4000 smaller islands and keys, for a
total land area of 109 886 km2 and a population of roughly
11 million. Cuba is located in the Caribbean Sea just south
of the Tropic of Cancer. Its immediate neighbours are the
Bahamas, Haiti, Jamaica, Mexico and the USA.

The youngest Hispano-American republic, Cuba was
founded in 1902, after a 30-year war of independence
against Spanish rule which ended in a four-year
occupation by US troops in 1898. During the first half of
the 20th century, Cuba was heavily controlled by foreign
interests within a plantation and extractive economy. 
A report by the ad hoc Truslow Commission of the
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development,
which had travelled to Cuba to study the provision of
loans, stated unequivocally in 1950 that ‘in the field of
applied research and labs, there was no development at
all in Cuba’ (Sáenz and García-Capote, 1989).

Just months after establishing a revolutionary
government, President Fidel Castro made his first science
policy statement in January 1960. ‘The future of our
country has to be necessarily a future of men [and
women] of science, of men [and women] of thought’, he
said, ‘because that is precisely what we are mostly sowing;
what we are sowing are opportunities for intelligence’
(Castro, 1960). 

This has been the cornerstone of Cuba’s scientific
development ever since. Following the revolution, the
development model evolved into a state-planned
economy with education and scientific development as
high priorities. Most of the research centres in Cuba today
were born of research groups, or started out as institutes,
in the decades immediately following the Cuban
revolution in 1959. Some of these centres, like the
National Centre for Scientific Research (CENIC) founded in
1965, played an essential role in training young science
students at home and in the eventual establishment of
many other research institutions.

By the dawn of the 21st century, Cuba was perceived as
being a proficient country in terms of scientific capacity,
despite having experienced more than four decades of a
trade embargo and restrictions on scientific exchanges
imposed by successive US administrations (Jorge-Pastrana

and Clegg, 2008). In a study commissioned by the World
Bank in 2001, Wagner et al of RAND, an S&T think tank in
the USA, classified nations into four categories according
to their scientific prowess: developed, proficient,
developing and lagging. In Latin America and the
Caribbean, only Brazil and Cuba qualified as ‘proficient’. 

Cuba is still recovering from the effects of the severe
economic crisis caused by the collapse of its main trading
partner, the Soviet Union, in the early 1990s: GDP dropped
by about 40% in less than five years and new markets had
to be found for up to 75% of foreign trade, under very
difficult credit conditions. 

Figure 1 shows a sustained, if modest, increase in Cuba’s
GDP between 2003 and 2007. The result is that the
country’s GDP, both overall and per capita, is now on a par
with levels at the end of the 1980s. Today, Cuba ranks
among medium-income countries. It is interesting to note
the growth in the percentage of GDP contributed by
community, social and personal services: this grew from
25.5% in 2002 to 34.5% in 2007. Cuba has also diversified
its economic ties. In 2006, its main foreign trading
partners were Venezuela, China, Spain and Canada, 
in descending order.

ORGANIZATION OF RESEARCH

In the mid-1990s, a Ministry for Science, Technology and
Environment (CITMA) was established with the aim of
harnessing Cuban scientific knowledge to a more
sustainable form of development. The ministry
encompasses a dozen science centres of national interest;
some of these are among the best in the country, like the
Institute of Meteorology (Table 1). There are subordinate
executive offices in each of the country’s 14 provinces, 
as well as co-ordinators for the 169 municipalities. 

In 1996, the Cuban Academy of Sciences was reorganized.
After 35 years of working mainly as a support body for
research and development (R&D), the members agreed to
new statutes allowing the academy to return to its traditional
role of primary scientific advisory body. The institution is now
also responsible for recognizing excellence in research and
for acting as the representative of the Cuban scientific
community, both in Cuba and abroad. The academy has a
very long tradition. It was one of the first merit-based

national academies of science to be established outside
Europe, in 1861, even though it languished for most of the
first half of the 20th century for the reasons evoked above. 

An overall National Plan for Science and Technology is
prepared each year by CITMA. The Plan is followed up by
specialized staff and the accomplishment of objectives
and overall progress is periodically reviewed by expert
groups organized by CITMA. Priority is given to projects
within the National Research Programmes in Science and
Technology which have been approved at the highest
level of CITMA, according to a peer review process, 
and which are in turn funded by the state budget. 
Other ministries select and support sector-targeted S&T
programmes in a similar fashion.

An analogous procedure is followed at the provincial level
at the demand of territorial authorities. Delegate Offices of
CITMA contribute to the selection of local projects and to
follow-up processes. These local R&D projects are also
funded by the state budget and usually implemented by
university research groups or scientific centres located in
the territory. 

R&D INPUT

R&D expenditure
Gross domestic expenditure on R&D (GERD) in Cuba is
more or less on a par with the mean for Latin America and
the Caribbean, although regional spending has surged in
recent years. The situation is more or less equivalent for
overall S&T expenditure (Figure 2).

Most R&D projects with a direct link to the immediate
demands of the productive sector are funded by
enterprises (Figure 3). The share of business funding of
R&D has declined in recent years (Figure 4).

Human resource issues
In 2008, 53.5% of all S&T professionals were women. 
Cuba is second only to Uruguay in Latin America for this
indicator, according to RICYT (2010). This proportion will
tend to increase, since 60% of graduates entering into a
scientific career were women in 2008 (ONE, 2008).

Tertiary education in Cuba today comprises 65 centres 
of higher education, spread across more than 
3500 campuses at the municipal level.

First-year enrollment in higher education more than
doubled between 2004/2005 and 2007/2008, from 
361 845 to 743 979. The social sciences and humanities
continue to attract the greatest number of vocations,
followed by the medical sciences, with 187 690 first-year
students in 2007/2008. A further 42 741 students chose
engineering in 2007/2008. Enrollment in the natural
sciences and mathematics has remained stable, with 3 970
first-year students in 2004/2005 and 3 922 in 2007/2008.

The total number of graduates has increased each year
this century, with an impressive leap in 2007/2008 to 
71 475, compared to 44 738 the year before. This
performance is largely due to the surge in graduates in
health-related disciplines, who numbered 8 396 in
2006/2007 and 24 441 just twelve months later. On the
flipside, the number of graduates in the natural sciences
and mathematics remains low: they numbered 601 in
2003/2004 and 559 in 2007/2008. Today, there are more
than 900 000 university graduates in Cuba, out of a
population of 11 million.

Scientists, engineers and technicians are employed in the
119 R&D institutions Cuba counts in its 14 provinces and in
34 other institutions performing S&T services. However, only
a small minority (7.3%) of R&D personnel are employed as
researchers. In 2006, the work of 7.1 Cubans in every 1 000
was related to S&T in one way or another, a ratio which had
dropped to 6.4 by 2007 (RICYT, 2010).

Cuba’s National Research Programmes
National Research Programmes in Science and Tech nology
(NRPs) in 2009 are listed in Table 2. Some of these date back
to previous periods, as in the case of the Programme for
Global Change and the Evolution of the Cuban Environment. 

One of the new NRPs is devoted to Information and
Communication Technologies (ICTs). In fact, since the end of
2002, computer science has been given a boost with the
establishment of a large University of Informatics Science.
The main campus is located in Havana, with three branches
elsewhere in the country. In 2006, this university reached its
designed capacity of 10 000 students, all of whom
participate actively in the application of research in
informatics to the Cuban economy and society. As part of
efforts to spread computer literacy to all those interested to
learn and in the perspective of progressive use of
informatics in society, a network of local computer clubs has
been put in place country-wide since 1990. This scheme has
been renewed and duplicated online in the past five years.
As of 2009, there were 602 cyber-clubs distributed across
the country, interconnected through an Intranet service. 

Internet access remains very low, at just 11.6% in 2007
according to the United Nations Statistical Division, although
this is a great improvement over the previous year (2.1%).
Gradual expansion of access to Internet will be dependent
on the conditions under which connectivity can be assured.
Expanding connectivity is restricted by the high cost of the

satellite channels used – so far, the country’s only available
possibility. It is also restricted by the refusal up to now to
allow Cuba to connect to Internet using an optic fibre cable
via either Florida or Mexico, due to the US economic
blockade, since both cables are managed by US companies.

Other important NRPs are devoted to neurosciences and to
promoting basic research in mathematics, physics and

computer science. Yet other programmes deal with 
previously well-established priorities, as in the case of plant
biotechnology and sustainable food production. As a matter
of fact, the impact of Cuban biotechnology on agriculture and
food production has been significant. Several projects for the
development of transgenic plants containing genes for
resistance to pests and diseases were under development in
2009. The potential of transgenic plants as systems for the
expression of recombinant proteins is being actively explored. 

Social sciences are also part of the NRP. Particular pro-
grammes are oriented, for example, towards coping with
specific features and problems of Cuban society or in
identifying and analysing major trends in the global economy.

The scientific endeavour devoted to energy efficiency and
the use of renewable energy sources does not qualify as
an NRP but is nevertheless part of a huge State effort to
rationalize energy consumption and promote savings.
Particular attention is also being paid to the integrated
management of water and soil resources, in order to cope
with drought and its effects. As a number of projects
under this scientific endeavour are considered a priority,
they are included in the national S&T budget. 

The same goes for nanosciences. The government is
beginning to build capacity in this field by providing basic
facilities and training personnel. Although nanosciences
are not formally recognized as an NRP, some related R&D
projects are being carried out within the framework of the
NRP devoted to new materials.

The priority given to biotechnology
In the early 1980s, Cuba stepped up its international
exchanges. This in turn made it more vulnerable to some
epizootics and epidemics. This would mark a turning point
in Cuba’s commitment to R&D: the combination of these
two factors, coupled with the availability of a core human
potential, would motivate Cuba to develop the scientific
establishment further and expand its base into the
national economy. This heralded the beginning of
accelerated research in molecular biology and genetic
engineering which would culminate in the founding of
the Centre of Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology in
1986, one of Cuba’s top R&D institutions.

Over a period of 20 years or so, the Cuban government
invested around US$1 billion to develop the country’s first
and most important science node – that of West Havana –
comprising of 52 institutions and enterprises related to
biotechnology, covering research, education, health and
economics. Ten institutions form the core of this node, 
in that they support the entire effort financially through
their production capacities and exports.

pipeline of more than 60 new products. Most of these
products are protected by intellectual property rights and
more than 500 patents have been filed abroad. Several
Cuban scientific results have been awarded the World
Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) Gold Medal. 

The case of biotechnology is typical of Cuba’s approach to R&D:
I the Cuban government is the source of investment; 
I biotechnology is part of the national health system

and, for this reason, national needs become a priority; 

I success in biotechnology is essentially supported by

Cuban scientists and professionals; 

I biotechnology follows a ‘closed cycle’ from research to
commercialization by fully integrated state institutions,
with profits generated from sales in foreign markets, 
an important part of which is reinvested in R&D; 

I national collaboration replaces competition among

individuals as a driving force of Cuban biotechnology;

I ‘spin off’ state enterprises grow out of scientific

institutions; 

I success in product development has in turn improved

Cuba’s ability to access foreign markets, especially in the
developed world, in terms of quality, production volumes,
cost, novelty and joint ventures (López Mola et al; 2006).
Two good examples are the licensing agreements signed
in 2005 with China’s Biotech Pharmaceutical Ltd for the
joint development, production and marketing of
monoclonal antibodies to treat auto-immune diseases
and lymphomas, and, secondly, the agreement signed in
2004 with the American corporation CancerVax for
technology transfer in vaccine production from Cuba to
the USA to combat malignant diseases.

Other R&D piorities 
The development and production of pharmaceuticals in
general – and biotechnological products in particular – is
without doubt the most successful example of the Cuban
scientific endeavour but it is not the only area of
importance for R&D. 

Another important priority today is energy. R&D in this area is
mainly related to wind energy production, hydropower, solar
photovoltaic and – to a lesser extent – thermal energy from
biomass. Generally speaking, priority is given to methods of
saving energy and to the efficient use of every energy source.

In 2008, these 10 institutions were carrying out more than
100 research projects, mainly related to biotechnology
applied to human health; these have generated a product

Cuba began inventorying and evaluating its natural resources
and ecosystems some decades ago. A comprehensive report

CITMA and eventually released in October 2008, following the
latest methodological guidelines established by the United
Nations Environment Programme (CITMA–UNEP, 2008). More
than 70 PhD holders from more than 50 national institutions
participated in the study. The report covers such key areas as
soils, water resources, biological diversity and the
atmosphere; it provides a science-based approach to
sustainable management of hydrographic basins, coastal
areas and the urban environment, these being considered the
main areas on which to focus management by the different
authorities involved under the guidance of CITMA.

Disaster monitoring and mitigation is taking on a growing
role, in light of the threat of stronger hurricanes, droughts,
coral bleaching and flooding in future as a consequence of
climate change. An evaluation was under way in 2009 of
Cuba’s vulnerability to extreme natural events, adaptation
to these and mitigation of their effects. Early warning
systems are constantly being improved. When Hurricane
Gustav, the worst storm Cuba had seen for 50 years, struck
on 30 August 2008, followed just days later by Hurricane
Ike, approximately 2.7 million Cubans were evacuated.
Economic losses totalled an estimated US$5 billion but,
thankfully, there were almost no casualties.

R&D OUTPUT

Scientific output in Cuba, as expressed by scientific papers
published in international journals, compares favourably
with the mean for Latin America and the Caribbean.
However, available data show that, whereas Cuba was

slightly ahead of the rest of the region in 2001 in terms of
papers per 100 000 population, the regional mean has
since progressed. If we take the level of GDP into
consideration in calculating scientific authorship, the data
paint a similar picture for the first few years of the decade.
However, both Cuba and the region begin losing ground
from 2005 onwards (Figure 5).

Despite this modest numeric output in international
publications, the results of Cuban research in several scientific
disciplines are of a high quality. In vaccine development, Cuba
is even at the forefront of research. One important detail is
that these results have a high local social impact; all Cuban
children are vaccinated, for instance, against 13 diseases and
eight of these vaccines are produced locally. 

Among Cuban pharmaceutical products, several should 
be highlighted. These include: the meningitis B vaccine, 
a recombinant vaccine for hepatitis B, a recombinant
streptokinase thrombolytic agent, the cholesterol-lowering
Atheromixol pill, recombinant human erythropoietin and
colony-stimulating factors. The list is long. To it has recently
been added a proprietary humanized antibody for the
treatment of cancer. 

In the diagnostic field, networks of neural diagnostics
laboratories and ultra-micro Elisa systems (SUMA) for early
infant diagnosis, blood safety and epidemiol ogical
surveillance have been established and continually
improved and expanded since the mid-1980s. These offer
coverage for the screening of the entire Cuban population
that is unparalleled in the world. 

Cuba [10] [P3].qxd:Layout 1  18/10/10  18:20  Page 129

The impact on the population’s health is evident: meningitis
epidemics have disappeared and hepatitis B is on the brink of
being eradicated from the infant population. The entire Cuban
population under 22 years of age is immunized against
hepatitis B, the incidence of which is the lowest in the world.

Cuban centres of excellence, this new synthetic vaccine
provides protection against H. influenzae infections, as well
as tetanus, diphtheria, whooping cough and hepatitis B. 
In December of the same year, Nature Biotechnology
published a review of the Cuban biotech industry. 

INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS

The growing visibility of Cuban science
The visibility of Cuba in the international scientific
community has increased somewhat in recent years. In July
2004, the American journal Science published a paper on
the develop ment at the University of Havana of a synthetic
conjugate polysaccharide vaccine against Haemophilus
influenzae type B. This bacterium is responsible for half of
the bacterial infections in children under the age of five,
including some of the most feared, like meningitis. In
September of the following year, Science showcased María
Guzmán, head of the virology department at the Tropical
Medicine Institute Pedro Kourí (IPK) in Havana and a
leading world expert on dengue fever. Guzmán was
presented as one of 12 ‘global voices of science’ in an issue
commemorating the journal’s 125th anniversary.

In 2008, the Cuban Academy of Sciences awarded a national
prize for the development and commercial production of
the first pentavalent vaccine produced in the developing
world. The result of close co-operation among several

Articles written by young Cuban authors in basic sciences are
also being published in high-ranking international scientific
journals like the International Journal of Mathematics and
Mathematical Sciences (Abreu, 2005). According to data
available at Thomson Reuter’s Web of Knowledge, Cuban
physicists were cited, on average, 60 times per year in
2004–2008, a significant increase. See also Figure 6.

International scientific co-operation
The Cuban scientific establishment is active in international 
co-operation, through bilateral agreements and by way of
participation in international organizations. Bilateral
agreements covering a wide range of research topics are in
place with Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico and Venezuela.
Beyond the region, China, India and Malaysia are the main
partners. Cuba is an active member of the International
Council for Science and the InterAcademy Panel for
International Issues. It also belongs to regional bodies like
the InterAmerican Network of Science Academies and the
Caribbean Scientific Union. The embargo has not been
effective in preventing international co-authorship of
scientific publications, except as concerns co-operation
with US scientists.

UNESCO SCIENCE REPORT 2010

Ongoing medical assistance to developing countries
Cuba also provides medical assistance to developing
countries confronted with an emergency. As a typical
example, Cuba and Brazil both responded to a WHO 
request in 2007 to provide the large quantities of doses of 
A-C anti-meningococcal vaccine required by African countries
facing health emergencies. The region at risk is home to 
400 million people and covers 21 countries, including Burkina
Faso, Ghana, Mali, Niger, Nigeria and Sudan. 

Cuban medical co-operation goes back over 40 years but 
it changed into higher gear with the launch of the
Comprehensive Health Programme (CHP) in 1998. This
began as an emergency response to the international
appeal for help formulated by the presidents of Central
American countries devastated by Hurricane Mitch.
Gradually, CHP developed into a regular assistance
programme for Central American and Caribbean countries.
At the request of their governments, the geographical
scope of the programme was later broadened to include
some African countries. As of 2009, Cuban collaborators
working for the CHP had provided medical care to 
95.4 million people and performed surgery on more than
2.2 million patients. At last count, Cuban personnel had
vaccinated 9.4 million people.

CONCLUSION

By harnessing S&T to social needs over the past 40 years,
Cuba has managed to eradicate illiteracy, extreme
poverty, hunger and infant deaths due to preventive
diseases. Today, the country ranks 51st in the UNDP’s
Human Development Index, placing it among countries
with high human development (UNDP, 2009). Cuba’s level
of development is considered as being on a par with that
of Uruguay (50th), Mexico (52nd) and Costa Rica (54th), and
as distancing Brazil (75th). In the region, besides Uruguay,
only Barbados (37th), Argentina (49th), Chile (44th) and
Antigua and Barbuda (47th) rank higher. Moreover,
according to the World Wide Fund For Nature’s Living
Planet report of 2006, Cuba is the only country with an
acceptable ‘ecological footprint’ (WWF, 2006, page 19).

Where should Cuba go from here? Special care will need to
go into updating and strengthening the technological
infrastructure of its R&D institutions. For example, between
2005 and 2008, the Cuban government modernized the local
Meteorological Service operated by the Institute of

130

Meteorology by installing modern computing systems and
other equipment. In 2009, this was still work in progress 
but there were already signs of a marked improvement in 
the efficiency of the early warning and hurricane-tracking
systems. This modernization process should extend 
progressively to other branches of meteorological science like
the mathematical modelling of potentially dangerous natural
events. In the near future, it will be imperative to update the
research technology of centres involved in other absolute
priorities for R&D, such as food security or energy research.

Some strategic areas have been proposed as priorities for
the short and medium term, to drive renewed investment
in S&T infrastructure, which will of course be dependent on
the country’s possibilities for funding. These areas have
been identified by means of a detailed consultation
process conducted in 2007–2008 by CITMA, in which the
Academy of Sciences took part. The process received input
from more than 600 scientific experts, university professors
and decision-makers, and includes contributions from
territorial authorities and business leaders. The identified
strategic areas can be summarized as follows:

I Innovation conducive to import substitution, a higher

standard of living and more efficient production
processes, such as in the areas of food production,
construction technologies, water management,
energy-efficient technologies and renewable sources
of energy. By 2020, it is hoped that 18% of the
country’s total energy consumption will be provided
by renewable sources.

I Competitive opportunities to attain a level of

excellence in areas where Cuba has recognized
capacities, or is developing such capacities, in order to
enhance exports and improve living conditions:
primarily, selected areas of biotechnologies, ICTs and
advanced medical equipment; this includes the
expansion of specialized value-added S&T services, 
as in the case of medicine.

I S&T fields in which Cuba must reach the forefront of

knowledge or keep up with relevant new and
convergent developments, such as materials science,
bioinformatics and neurosciences. With regard to
nanoscience and nanotechnology, a government
endeavour is currently devoted to capacity-building,
with special emphasis on training highly qualified
human resources to work in the field.

Cuba [10] [P3].qxd:Layout 1  18/10/10  18:20  Page 131

Cuba

I S&T problems that are especially relevant to Cuba’s

sustainable socio-economic development and to
which significant contributions can be provided by the
national STI system. Efforts in this area mainly focus on
devising science-based measures to adapt to the
impact of climate change, as well as applied research
related to reducing vulnerability to natural disasters.

INTRODUCTION

Like elsewhere, the Caribbean region faces numerous
challenges in a world that is becoming more and more
interconnected. The peak in international prices of food
and energy in 2007 and 2008 has further weakened the
fragile economies of many countries. In Jamaica, for
example, the import bill for petroleum products of
roughly US$2 billion in 2007 was similar to the value of
exports, which stood at nearly US$1.8 billion the same
year; in 2006, the import bill had represented just 66% of
export earnings (Government of Jamaica, 2006). 

In such a climate, most governments in the region would find
it difficult to augment their current investment in research
and development (R&D), which has largely stagnated over
the past decade at a dismal level of about 0.1% of GDP
(Planning Institute of Jamaica, 2007). This is well below the
target of 1% of gross domestic expenditure on R&D (GERD)
that many developing countries agree they should strive for.
This target is not unreasonable and has already been
achieved by one of the smallest and poorest countries,
Rwanda, which devotes 1.6% of GDP to science, technology
and innovation (STI) [African Development Bank, 2007]. As a
consequence, the Millennium Development Goals (Annex II)
could remain largely unfilled, with most of the countries in
the region unable to lift themselves out of the poverty trap. 

The global recession that originated in the USA in 2008 has
exacerbated the situation. The fragile tourism industry on
which so many of the region’s economies depend has been
severely affected. For example, 83 460 tourists holidayed on
the island of Tobago in 2006, compared to just 23 580 from
January to June 2008, according to the Central Statistical
Office of Trinidad and Tobago. The unofficial occupancy rate
of hotels for the winter of 2008/2009 was about 30%, down
from the normal rate of over 70%. In addition, both Jamaica
and Guyana have experienced a drastic reduction in the flow
of remittances from abroad, upon which they are so
dependent: in Guyana, remittances contributed 22% of GDP
in 2006. Even Trinidad and Tobago, the strongest economy in
the region, has not been exempt from the ‘meltdown’. In early
2009, the government had to rescue, via a financial bailout,
one of the biggest private companies in the country, CL
Financial, which reportedly contributed 25% of GDP and
whose investments extended beyond the region. With
weakening economies and the attendant rising
unemployment, the immediate outlook for the region 
does not look bright. 

In spite of this, the scientific community must pursue its
efforts to persuade governments that many of the
Caribbean’s socio-economic problems cannot be solved
without a dedicated push to develop and apply science
and technology (S&T), particularly in the areas of
renewable energy and food security (Box 1). The fate of
the regional centre for renewable energy, which was to be
hosted by Barbados until the project collapsed recently,
does not send an encouraging signal. Governments must
resist the temptation to put S&T on the back burner. The
determination of President Obama to ‘restore science to
its rightful place and wield technology’s wonders’ may
make the task of convincing governments a little easier.

In the larger countries, there are blocks to build upon. 
The governments of Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago have
both formulated long-term development plans, Vision 2030
and Vision 2020 respectively, which place STI capacity-
building at their heart. Trinidad and Tobago’s Vision 2020 was
devised in 2002. It rests on five pillars: enabling competitive
business; developing innovative people; nurturing a caring
society; investing in sound infrastructure and the
environment; and promoting effective government. In 2006,
the first operational plan was devised for 2007–2010. As for
Jamaica, its Vision 2030 will be the country’s first long-term
development plan. It was presented to Parliament in 2009.
The plan is being implemented via three medium-term
socio-economic policy frameworks, through which funding
will be identified. The plan’s strategic priorities include the
development of human resources; international
competitiveness; environmental sustainability; health; 
social protection; STI; effective governance; and law 
and order.

R&D INPUT

Trends in human resources 
One bright spot in an otherwise rather sombre tableau is
the focus on higher education. Over the last few years,
two new universities have been established in the
Caribbean; the state-owned University of Trinidad and
Tobago (2004) and the private University of the Southern
Caribbean (2006), also situated on the island of Trinidad.
This brings the number of tertiary-level institutions in the
countries of the Caribbean Common Market (CARICOM),
with the exception of Haiti, to seven, for a population of
about six million (Table 1): a ratio that compares
favourably with other regions.

Moreover, thanks mainly to the introduction of free tertiary
education in Trinidad and Tobago in 2006, student
enrollment has increased substantially. For example, the
three campuses of the University of the West Indies (UWI)
have seen enrollment climb by, respectively, 65% (Cave Hill
in Barbados), 68% (Mona in Jamaica) and 102% (Trinidad
and Tobago) [Figure 1}. Growth in graduate enrollment has
been less impressive over the same period and mainly
confined to teaching, as opposed to research programmes.

While the rapid expansion of tertiary education in the
region is most encouraging, it has led to one major
problem. Generally speaking, the burgeoning student
population has not translated into a proportionate
increase in academic staff, resulting in additional teaching
duties and space requirements. This has an adverse
impact on efforts to create a vibrant research culture. 
To the credit of the UWI, ‘semester leave’ and research
fellowships have been introduced to deal with this
situation.

Another problem concerns sabbatical leave. This is meant
to be accorded every six years so that staff can focus on

The CARICOM countries

Box 1: A centre of excellence to safeguard food security in Jamaica

In March 2008, at a time of escalating
prices for cereal imports, the Jamaican
Minister of Agriculture, Christopher
Tufton, announced the establishment of
a centre of excellence for agriculture at
the Ministry’s Bodles Research Station in
St Catherine. The centre is being
developed through a US$3 million
provision from the Spanish Agency for
International Development, in a drive to
safeguard Jamaica’s food security. 
Essentially, the centre will be ‘a
facility that does applied research,
practical research and training in the
latest agricultural technologies in the
world, based on our needs [and] our
requirements’, Dr Tufton outlined.
These needs and requirements include
the implementation of adequate and
efficient irrigation mechanisms and
systems, orchard development and
greenhouse technology. He lamented
the ‘misuse and abuse’ of water, noting
that ‘it’s not that we don’t have enough

water, it’s that we don’t use it properly;
we over-irrigate and we have to find a
way to deal with that.’

The minister noted that citrus

crops were the only established
orchards in Jamaica. He stressed the
need to do the same with other crops
such as cashew, naseberry, mango
and cacao. ‘With orchards come risks’,
he said, ‘because they are susceptible
to diseases. We want to put some
capacity in to anticipate some of
those risks and deal with them.’
Dr Tufton said that, once the

centre was established, he would be
seeking to initiate collaboration with
institutions like the University of the
West Indies (UWI) to optimize the
facility’s resources. He had already
advised the University of Technology,
after it approached him regarding
offering certification in agricultural
research, to enter into discussions with
the UWI on a possible partnership.

The new centre will be working on

greenhouse expansion, greenhouses
being a form of protected agriculture
reputed for their high productivity.
Jamaica sent 12 extension officers to
Costa Rica for a month to study
greenhouse technology in April 2008,
under an agreement signed between
the two countries earlier the same year. 

Another initiative will consist of

developing cassava, a drought-
resistant crop, to reduce dependence
on imported starches like rice, corn
and wheat. The minister disclosed that
approximately 2 000 acres of restored
bauxite lands had been identified for
the purpose of growing cassava, a
project that would involve small-
holder farmers. The ministry also plans
to undertake test trials to determine
the suitability of cassava as a substitute
for corn-based livestock feed.

their research and recharge their scholastic batteries for a
year. This benefits not only the individual but also the
institution. However, for financial reasons, sabbatical leave
is not a regular entitlement in the region. In some cases, it
has even become an award for longevity, thereby defeating
the very purpose for which it is meant. Universities thus
need to revisit their policy for sabbatical leave.

There is another problem which this time affects Guyana
and Suriname specifically. Although the salaries of
academic staff have risen over the years in these
countries, they still remain unattractive and
uncompetitive, a situation that is hardly likely to change in
the near future. This makes it difficult to recruit high-
quality staff and, consequently, to mount competitive
postgraduate programmes and create an enabling
research environment. Together, Cariscience (Box 2) and
the UWI are trying to help the national Universities of
Guyana and Suriname improve their postgraduate and
staff development programmes. 

While some attempts have been made to address gender
issues, the status quo has largely prevailed in recent years.
There is still a paucity of senior women at both the
professorial and decision-making level of S&T. The Faculty
of Pure and Applied Sciences at the UWI, for example,
counts just four full women professors out of a staff of over
150. The ‘leaky pipeline’ has not yet been repaired, with
women renouncing posts of responsibility for a variety of
reasons that include the conflict with family life and a
certain discomfort with the science culture. In disciplines
such as physics and computer science, women are still few
and far between at the faculty level. There have been
claims of disparities in remuneration and in the allocation
of research funds and facilities. The situation is reversed
when it comes to undergraduate and post-graduate
enrollment, as here women continue to outnumber men.
At the UWI’s Mona campus, for example, about 73% of
undergraduate students were women in 2005/2006 and
2006/2007. Policy- and decision-makers will have to
intensify their efforts to address this gender imbalance.

The migration of skilled labour is another key issue. The
figures remain high for many CARICOM countries. For
example, about 27 000 Jamaicans (1% of the population)
migrated to the USA, Canada or the UK in 2007. This said,
the increase in remittances from nationals working abroad
has cushioned the impact of migration and softened its
traditional image somewhat. Remittance inflows into
Jamaica, for instance, stood at US$1.9 billion in 2007, 
close to export earnings of US$1.8 billion. This makes
remittances Jamaica’s top foreign-exchange 
earner. It is essential to determine how CARICOM
countries can otherwise engage the diaspora in 
national development programmes. A number of

organizations grouping the diaspora have been formed
and in some cases have attracted large numbers. 

It is in this context that the Caribbean Diaspora for
Science, Technology and Innovation was officially
launched in September 2008 in Port of Spain, at the
10th anniversary of Cariscience, by Fitzgerald Jeffrey, 
Minister of Science and Technology and Tertiary 
Education of Trinidad and Tobago. This is a commendable
effort, particularly in light of the fact that chronic brain
drain is not about to go away, given the unlikelihood  
of socio-economic conditions improving in the
foreseeable future.

Trends in R&D expenditure 
Adequate funding is a prerequisite for the creation of a
dynamic research culture. The reality in the Caribbean is
that investment in R&D by both governments and the
private sector is grossly inadequate. This is the major
difficulty encountered by regional scientists. Let us take
the case of Trinidad and Tobago. By far the wealthiest of
the Caribbean countries, with a booming economy based
on natural resources, it spent a mere 0.06% of GDP in
2007 on R&D and an average of 0.12% over 2000–2005.
At their annual meeting in 1999, the heads of
government endorsed a proposal to establish a
Caribbean Regional Research Agency. A decade later, 
this is yet to become a reality. Similarly, the share of
business R&D in the total remains very low throughout
the region, even if it has grown in Trinidad and Tobago
from 13% in 2000 to 24% in 2005, according to the
UNESCO Institute for Statistics.

The role of business
The main businesses in the region are associated with:
(1) oil and gas, in Trinidad and Tobago; (2) alumina and
bauxite, in Guyana, Jamaica and Suriname; (3) agriculture,
in nearly all countries; and (4) tourism, nearly all
countries.

Much of the region is no longer self-sufficient in food. 
In 1995, Belize, Dominica, Guyana, St Lucia and St Vincent
and the Grenadines all exported more food than they
imported, whereas Jamaica managed to balance food
imports and exports. By 2004, only Belize and Guyana
were still exporting more food than they imported and
Jamaica was importing over 60% of staple foods,
according to the Minister of Agriculture. The growth in
tourism may have contributed to this situation, as it has
intensified the demand for food not grown in the region
(FAO, 2007). 

R&D is conducted mainly in parent countries beyond 
the region. However, a disturbing trend, albeit one 
which may be justified by economic competitive
environments, is that some major local companies 
have established R&D facilities in their overseas
operations to respond more effectively to market 
realities abroad and at home. For example,
GraceKennedy, a large indi genous Jamaican company,
established an R&D outfit in Canada in 2006 to develop
new products for its domestic and foreign markets
(Meikle, 2006). 

The CARICOM countries

In response to this new reality, Kahwa (2003) proposed a
model of R&D for developing countries that find their
R&D skills underutilized at home. Dubbed ‘Strategic
Decoupling’, the model seeks to focus the R&D effort of a
researcher from a developing country on competitive
global R&D opportunities. The model rests on success in
the international R&D arena earning researchers from
developing countries serious attention at home, 
thereby spawning confidence in their abilities at all 
levels. Indeed, the success of the small but growing
pharmaceutical R&D operations undertaken by the 
UWI campuses in Barbados and Jamaica is indicative 
of the potential effectiveness of the Strategic 
Decoupling model. 

These developments notwithstanding, a healthy level of
innovation seems to be taking root in some businesses.
The chicken and egg industry in the region is vibrant and
vertically integrated, with a fairly large small-farmer base
producing high-quality poultry products. This said, the
process by which this has been achieved needs to be
carefully studied and documented, so that lessons
learned therefrom can be replicated in other sectors. 

For the most part, innovation in the productive sector is,
according to Science, Technology and Innovation Policy
Review, Jamaica (UNCTAD, 1999), hampered by a
disconnection between the R&D effort and critical
industry needs. The productive sector is not investing
enough in R&D (in-house or otherwise); there is thus little
incentive for researchers to pay the requisite attention to
the problems of industry. There is a need for policy
innovation to create an integrated environment in which
R&D institutions, the government and the private sector
all work together to bring S&T to bear on economic
growth, poverty reduction and job creation and in raising
the standard of living. 

Some business incubation is going on in Jamaica at the
University of Technology and at the country’s Scientific
Research Council. The UWI has also established the Mona
Institute of Applied Sciences (in 2001) to spearhead its
efforts to transfer technology and commercialize the
fruits of research. Success is slow in coming, however; this
is largely due to the lack of mechanisms for venture
capital, combined with weak linkages – even non-
existent in some cases – between universities, public
research institutes and the private sector in national
systems of innovation.

UNESCO SCIENCE REPORT 2010

Box 2: Cariscience

Cariscience is a sub-regional network
of scientists bent on upgrading the
academic excellence of graduate,
postgraduate and R&D programmes
in the Caribbean. An NGO affiliated to
UNESCO, Cariscience was launched in
June 1999 in Jamaica. 

The network strives to strengthen
theoretical and practical knowledge in
basic and applied sciences in the
Caribbean, to increase the number of
postgraduate and R&D programmes,
and to foster ties between these
programmes. Cariscience is also
supporting the development of an
accreditation and evaluation system
for postgraduate science
programmes. Cariscience co-ordinates
exchanges between researchers,
teachers and students, organizes joint
research projects and regional
courses, and supports curriculum
development and the training of
science teachers. In 2007, it organized
the first Caribbean Summer School in
Mathematics and Physics, to

introduce postgraduate students and
researchers to frontier science in these
disciplines. The ultimate goal is to
improve science education and create
a pool of young internationally
competitive research scholars. This
includes fostering linkages with the
productive sector.

In recent years, Cariscience has

gone beyond its original mandate to
embrace the environmental sciences.
It has undertaken a water project
funded by UNESCO, for example, and
organized a workshop on coastal
erosion in 2005.

Since 2006, Cariscience has

initiated and supported all the major
regional meetings. The first was
Harnessing Science and Technology
for Caribbean Development (Trinidad
and Tobago) in 2006, which drew
participants from government,
academia and industry. As part of the
Plan of Action, a working group on
science education was set up which
recommended ‘that our education

systems make concepts of
entrepreneurship and the use of 
STI part of the education curriculum
from the primary-school level.’
Cariscience went on to organize a
CARICOM Science Education
Conference in Jamaica in November
2007, sponsored by UNESCO, the
InterAmerican Network of Academies
of Sciences and the Caribbean
Academy of Sciences.

In September 2007, Cariscience
organized a four-day conference in
Tobago on renewable energy in the
Caribbean. This led to the creation of
the Committee on Caribbean
Education and Capacity-Building for
Sustainable Energy in 2008, overseen
by Cariscience.

R&D OUTPUT

CARICOM publications
Although there are some encouraging developments in
terms of R&D output, progress is still painfully slow in the
Caribbean. There are also persistent reports of a
disconnection between the output of researchers, on the
one hand, and the R&D needs of the productive sector, 
on the other. In 2008, Prime Minister Golding of Jamaica
asserted that ‘research has been too academic’ and
demanded that it be ‘synchronized with growth
objectives’. Although he makes a critically important
point, research has still not been planned and resourced
to perform this role in any of the CARICOM countries. 

Indeed, the citation rate in the international literature for
original research articles from the region shows only
modest growth of roughly 22% over 2001–2005 and even a

worrisome downturn in 2006. Furthermore, articles in basic
sciences tend to be stagnating at about 150 per year for the
2001–2007 period, save for a peak in 2005 (Figure 3). The
majority of original research articles come from medical
and allied fields due, in part, to the effectiveness of the West
Indian Medical Journal in nurturing research and publication
skills (Figure 4). The participation rate in original research
publishing is more encouraging. Whereas Jamaica, Trinidad
and Tobago and Barbados have traditionally dominated
CARICOM publications in international literature, every
CARICOM country except Montserrat has shown some
research and publishing activity during 2001–2007.
Newcomers Bahamas, Belize and Grenada, in particular, are
showing some promise (Figure 5). 

The dominant institution in higher education for the past
60 years has been the UWI. While this is still the case, with
over 70% of CARICOM articles stemming from the UWI,
other institutions have also come on the scene (Figure 6).

138

Caricom_v7 [P3].qxp:Layout 1  18/10/10  18:31  Page 139

Their publication rates remain modest but that of 
St Georges University in Grenada is showing considerable
promise; its publications are dominated by the medical
sciences. The governments of Guyana and Suriname will
need to invest more in their national universities to turn
their scholarly productivity around. 

CARICOM researchers exhibit considerable readiness to
collaborate, especially with their counterparts in the USA,
Canada and the UK who co-authored 29%, 11% and 6 %
respectively of CARICOM papers over 2001–2007. This is
an important step in the process of adaptation, diffusion
and adoption of S&T by the developing countries that
make up CARICOM.

Intellectual property issues are usually settled by
researchers with the assistance of specialized offices and
policies established at their universities and research
institutions. There are potential sources of intellectual
property in medical, agricultural, engineering and basic
research. The protection of intellectual property is
frequently hampered by a shortage of funds and
researchers also tend to resort to authoring a research
paper rather than doing all they can to bring their work 
to patentable levels. These are strategic issues that the
region will have to tackle.

CARICOM patents 
The picture with regard to CARICOM patents is a little
murky but it does show some improvement in innovation
in Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago (Figure 7). In Jamaica,
the number of patents granted to local inventors
increased from zero in 2001 to nine in 2005 and 2006. 
The number of applications received by the Jamaica
Intellectual Property Office is increasing, largely due to
external interest. Jamaican applicants numbered in the
range of 4–21 annually over the 2001–2007 period. 

The patent situation in Trinidad and Tobago shows
considerable interest from foreign applicants, which
augers well for the country’s efforts to make the economy
knowledge-driven. However, in its drive for a knowledge-
intensive economy, it will be important for Trinidad and
Tobago to cultivate home-grown inventions, achieve the
Millennium Development Goals and realize its own
ambitions of obtaining developed-country status by 2020. 

The Intellectual Property Office of Trinidad and Tobago
reports that there are fewer than two applications per year

from local inventors. Barbados’ patents are even rarer and
have mostly been granted to foreign applicants. The region’s
inventors have been somewhat successful with their patent
applications in the USA, especially the Bahamanians, who
secured 32 patents from the US Patents and Trademark
Office (USPTO) over 2002–2007. Other countries having
secured USPTO patents over the same period are: Barbados
(7); Jamaica (6); St Lucia (2); and Trinidad and Tobago (6).

THE ROLE OF REGIONAL BODIES

There are two major regional NGOs in the region, the
Caribbean Academy of Sciences (CAS) and Cariscience.
Founded in 1988, CAS has had a new lease of life in recent
years. It has mounted major scientific meetings in
Guadeloupe (2006), on the theme of Science and Technology
in a Caribbean Environment and, in Grenada (2008), on
Science and Technology: Vehicles for Sustainable Economic
Development in the Caribbean. CAS has also obtained a
grant from the European Union for a project to raise
awareness of ICT issues. Within this project, CAS organized a
Caribbean Conference on Information and Communication
Technology: Research, Applications and Policies, at the Mona
Campus of UWI in March 2009, immediately followed by an
awareness-building workshop. Despite the EU grant, CAS
continues to be plagued by funding shortages.

CAS has considerable potential for mobilizing scientists 
in the region. It reaches out to the wider scientific
community through its membership of the Caribbean

Scientific Union, the Academy of Sciences for the
Developing World (TWAS), the InterAmerican Network of
Science Academies and the InterAcademy Panel (IAP). It is
hoped that the support it enjoys from international
scientific academies will strengthen its regional position
and attract funding from within the Caribbean.

Cariscience enjoys close ties to UNESCO and its Abdus Salam
Inte rnational Centre for Theoretical Physics in Italy; to the
Organization of American States; and to the International
Centre for South–South Co-operation in Science,
Technology and Innovation launched in Malaysia in 2008.
For a region as small as the Caribbean, these links are
essential if it is to maintain a dynamic scientific community.

As for the Caribbean Council of Science and Technology
(CCST), an intergovernmental organization, it continues to
operate with support from only a handful of governments.
Mokhele (2007) has noted the operational difficulties faced
by the CCST since its inception and recommended that its
fate be decided by the authorities.

UNESCO SCIENCE REPORT 2010

STRENGTHENING REGIONAL 
CO-OPERATION
The lack of a critical mass of scientists in any of the
Caribbean countries, coupled with weak and fragile
economies with the notable exception of Trinidad and
Tobago, makes regional co-operation a necessity. 
Even in Trinidad and Tobago, there are just 477 scientists
per million population. 

A number of events have been held in recent years to
strengthen co-operation in the Caribbean. In 2006, a
major conference on Harnessing Science and Technology
for Caribbean Development was held in Trinidad and
Tobago under the auspices of CARICOM and the
patronage of then Prime Minister of Grenada, Keith
Mitchell, who at the time served as Head of Government
with responsibility for S&T within CARICOM. The
conference’s main sponsors were UNESCO and

Cariscience. Emanating from this Conference were the
Tobago Declaration and an accompanying Plan of Action.
A Steering Committee was subsequently established by
Prime Minister Mitchell to drive implementation of the
Plan of Action.

UNESCO agreed to provide a consultant to visit the region,
assess the status of S&T and assist in providing the
necessary platform for implementing the Plan of Action.
The consultant, Dr Khotso Mokhele, visited the region in
late 2006 before submitting a report to UNESCO early the
following year. Known as the Mokhele Report, it was
presented by UNESCO to high-level government and
CARICOM officials in September 2007 (Mokhele, 2007). 
A high-level meeting involving ministers of science and
technology and education, heads of tertiary institutions
and captains of industry was convened by the Office of
Prime Minister Mitchell in April 2008 to discuss the
Mokhele Report (Box 3).

Box 3: The Mokhele Report

In 2007, a report entitled Using Science,
Technology and Innovation to Change
the Fortunes of the Caribbean Region was
prepared by Dr Khotso Mokhele, former
President and Chief Executive Officer of
the National Research Foundation of
South Africa, under a consultancy
commissioned by UNESCO and the
CARICOM Steering Committee on
Science and Technology. 

Higher education
The report noted that there were
competent higher education
institutions in the CARICOM countries
but virtually no funding to support
full-time postgraduate studies, with
the possible exception of Trinidad.
Mokhele observed that this situation
was aggravated by the progressive
loss of the regional character of the
UWI by the devolution of authority to
national authorities in a few major
territories. Mokhele argued that
political devolution would undermine

the impetus towards regional
integration, at a time when integration
was being pursued by other major
global geographical blocks, especially
as academic research was best
advanced in small island states by
regional collaboration. He further
intimated that the territories without a
UWI campus needed urgent attention. 

Economic structure 
Mokhele observed that the region’s
economy was mainly mercantile and
service-oriented, with mining and
agriculture being in decline. The lack
of a push–pull relationship between
S&T and production tended to
discourage youth from studying
science, at a time when this was
essential for development. 

This disconnect between S&T and

society had led to a propensity to
criticize without proposing solutions,
he observed. It had also created a
schism between the leaders of society

and the S&T community. The former
criticized the unwillingness of
researchers to tackle the needs of
society and the latter felt their work
was misunderstood.

Funding and implementation
The report stressed that government
spending on S&T and R&D was
miniscule, even though investment in
research and innovation was the best
path for lifting countries out of
underdevelopment. Mokhele urged
governments to forge international
partnerships but pointed out that this
did not mean they should relinquish
responsibility for stimulating STI at
home. He noted that the bureaucratic
and consensual nature of
government bodies prompted the
belief that agencies formed and
funded by them should be operated
at arms length for flexibility and
efficiency. On the contrary, stated
Mokhele, these institutions needed to

142

Caricom_v7 [P3].qxp:Layout 1  18/10/10  18:31  Page 143

The CARICOM countries

The principal recommendation from this meeting was
‘that an overarching broad-based agency called the
Caribbean Science Foundation be established as soon as
possible to develop S&T and build the requisite capacity
to harness S&T for the region’s development’. This is an
opportunity for the scientific community to deal with its
problem of fragmentation and unite under one umbrella
to transform the region’s S&T landscape. 

However, this can only be achieved if there is the political 
will to move forward and the active co-operation of all
stakeholders. In this regard, it is heartening to see that the
strongly recommended Caribbean Science Foundation
has now become a reality. It was officially launched on 
21 September 2010 at the Caribbean Science Forum. The
premonitory theme of the forum was Science, Technology,
Innovation and Entrepreneurship – the Way Forward for
the Caribbean.

CONCLUSION

The CARICOM region enjoys a certain measure of stability.
It also has a reasonable infrastructure in place for
education, information and communication, together
with a group of dedicated scientists. The region therefore
possesses the foundations on which to build its capacity
to harness S&T more effectively to the socio-economic
development of the Caribbean. 

be more accountable than
government bodies. 

Recommendations
The report recommended a
supranational approach to higher
education and R&D. It called for the
setting up of a regional Research and
Innovation Agency, the medium- to
long-term funding of which would
need to be assured by the
government and banking sector, via
soft loans, grants and so on. The
agency would be mandated to foster
ties between bright young
entrepreneurs and young scientists,
technologists and engineers, to make
the best use of knowledge to create
new businesses and jobs. 

The report also recommended

developing ‘a truly Caribbean
university’. In parallel, it called for a
fund to be set up within the agency
to allow for full-time postgraduate
study and post-doctoral fellowships to

make the university more inclusive.
The fund could be administered by
the Research and Innovation Agency.
It also recommended the launch

of an R&D survey to reveal the true
state of affairs and provide data of use
for international comparisons. 

Another key recommendation

was for NGOs like the Caribbean
Academy of Sciences and Cariscience
to be strengthened, as these were
considered vital for providing up-to-
date information and analysis of the
influence of global S&T on the
Caribbean region. This was all the
more important, noted Mokhele, in
that there was no regional ‘think-tank’,
nor any science advisors to the prime
ministers or parliaments, with the
exception of Jamaica and Guyana. 

Reception of the report
Many of the report’s findings were
endorsed at a meeting of the
CARICOM countries in Grenada on 

9 April 2008, convened specifically to
discuss the report. In commenting on
its findings, Dr Arnoldo Ventura of the
Office of the Prime Minister in Jamaica
acknowledged that clear economic
demand for S&T was largely non-
existent in the Caribbean, despite the
fact that both demand and supply
were important to trigger innovation.
He observed that ‘in our region, there
is reasonably good R&D but pilot
plants, scale-ups, repair, design,
maintenance and engineering
capabilities are weak and often
absent. This has to be remedied.’

The meeting recommended the

establishment of the Caribbean
Science Foundation ‘as soon as
possible to develop STI … for the
region’s development’. Among other
functions, the foundation would be
responsible for strengthening the
weak link between the private sector
and academia by fostering
collaborative R&D.

The EU is now clearly the world leader as
far as SCI publications are concerned.
But what counts in terms of input is
expenditure on R&D and, in terms of
output, innovation performance.

INTRODUCTION

The European Union (EU) now counts 27 member states.
Since the previous enlargement embraced 10 new
countries1 on 1 May 2004, Bulgaria and Romania have joined
the fold, on 1 January 2007. The total population of the
EU-27 stood at 495.5 million in 2008, versus 486.6 million
five years earlier for the same 27 countries. Negotiations
with three more candidate countries are ongoing: Croatia,
the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Turkey.

Eleven countries have concluded co-operation agreements
in science and technology (S&T) that involve contributing to
the budget of the EU’s Seventh Framework Programme for
Research and Technological Development (FP7), covering
2007–2013. These include the four remaining members of
the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), Iceland,
Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland, as well as Israel and
Turkey. The others are Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina,
Croatia, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia,
Montenegro and Serbia. These 11 countries participate in the
FP7 on the same footing as the EU member states. In
describing developments and performance in the EU
member states over the coming pages, some information on
the EFTA countries in particular will thus be included. Neither
Turkey nor those countries in Southeast Europe which are
not EU members will be discussed, however, as they are the
object of separate chapters (see pages 183 and 201).

Real growth in GDP for the EU-27 came to 11.9% for the
cumulative five-year period to 2008, resulting in an
estimated GDP per capita in purchasing power parity (PPP)
of €25 100 in 2008 (Table 1). Obviously, growth rates vary
greatly among the 27 member states. Slovakia, Latvia and
Lithuania lead the pack with five-year real growth rates of as
much as 40–43%. At the other end of the scale, Italy and
Portugal report lagging five-year growth rates of 5–6%.
Clearly, the newer member states are catching up in
economic terms, although there remain yawning absolute
differences. Estimated GDP per capita (in PPP) in 2008 is
lowest in Bulgaria and Romania, at €10 000 and €11 300
respectively, followed by Poland and Latvia at €13 800 and
€13 900. Apart from the exceptional case of Luxembourg,
where GDP per capita was a whopping €67 600 in 2008, the
‘normal’high scorers are Ireland, the Netherlands and
Austria at €36,300, €33 400 and €31 300 respectively.

That was before the recession. There is little doubt that the
next UNESCO Science Report, looking back on the years
2010–2014, will paint a very different picture. The economic
recession that has been hurting countries deeply all over the
world since the last quarter of 2008 will have a widely
varying impact on individual EU member states. That much
is clear from the May 2009 forecasts for GDP growth – or
rather shrinkage – with estimates of a contraction of more
than 10% in 2009 for some countries. Ireland has been one
of the first casualties; after decades of‘an economic miracle’,

the Irish economy contracted by 8.5% on an annual basis
in the first three months of 2009, according to the Irish
Central Statistics Office. 

Although several countries have stated individually and
collectively that investment in research and education will
be essential to overcome the crisis and even consolidate
their position afterwards, neither the recovery packages
put together by both individual countries and the EU, nor
the budgetary forecasts for research and education seem
yet to warrant great optimism, in marked contrast to the
USA. One example is the United Kingdom; in its 30 April
2009 issue, the British journal Nature reported that, apart
from an additional £1.4 billion for low-carbon business and
technology, the UK’s recovery package provided few
incentives for research and development (R&D). One
measure amounted to swapping £103 million from the
research councils’ budget for ‘blue-skies’ research2 in key
areas of economic importance. This finding seems to tally
with the much less optimistic, more passive view among
companies in Europe than their counterparts in the USA
and China, or even in wider Asia. The biannual Survey3 of 
1 309 Chief Financial Officers of companies in the USA,
Europe, China and the rest of Asia on their expectations 
for the second quarter of 2009 found that European
companies still regarded their future with pessimism. They
chose to focus on reducting costs and  investment in R&D,
in preference to redefining their business model, markets
or strategies.

From a global perspective, by far the most important
political development in relation to R&D in recent years will
have been China’s rapid move centre stage. Collaboration
with individual researchers, between universities or
between funding agencies is on the rise and, in policy
discussions on research infrastructure, China is considered
a global player, yet another manifestation of its
omnipresence. Meanwhile, Europe still lacks the necessary
co-ordination mechanism to co-operate on a large scale
with a country like China.   We shall examine China’s rising
star towards the end of the present chapter (see page 177).

SOME KEY POLICY ISSUES

There is growing recognition in Europe that, without some
fundamental changes in the way member states and the
EU institutions define their responsibilities in science,
technology and innovation (STI), Europe will not easily
achieve its goal of becoming the most competitive and
dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world by
2010. The Lisbon Strategy, as it is known, was adopted by
heads of state and government in the Portuguese capital
in 2000. Two years later in the Spanish city of Barcelona,
they would fix a target for achieving this eldorado: each
country would strive to devote 3% of GDP to expenditure
on research and development (GERD) by 2010, with the
private sector expected to contribute two-thirds of this
effort. It is no secret today that this target will not be met. 

The concept of the European Research Area dates back to
the adoption of the Lisbon Strategy in 2000 (see page 194).
The concept has since been revitalized by the European
Commission, the Council of Ministers and the European
Parliament to express the idea that Europe as a whole
must make big strides in six areas:

Europe must have a sufficient number of researchers
who must be well-trained and mobile;
research infrastructure is vital to facilitate research in all
areas of S&T;
excellent institutions of higher learning and research
are needed;
knowledge sharing across research bodies – including
the private sector – is a key prerequisite for success;
co-ordinated research programmes must form a glue
for dispersed national efforts;
last but not least, Europe must be open to the world in
its STI efforts.

The EU’s Framework Programmes and Europe’s national
programmes cannot continue to operate in the relative
isolation from one other that has become their hallmark.
This includes the programmes of the national funding
agencies, which are all the more important in that they
constitute most of the flexible funding for research.
Co-ordination between national programmes has always
been part of European rhetoric but it is now being
admitted that the slew of mechanisms embraced
successively to bring about co-ordination have not
worked well. Part of the reason for this was no doubt the
adoption of a far too comprehensive and insufficiently

EU chapter [12] [P3]:Layout 1  18/10/10  18:36  Page 149

focused approach to co-ordination, without asking where
and when co-ordination was actually most urgently
needed or whether key stakeholders would be willing to
accept co-ordination. 

The Joint Technology Initiatives discussed farther down
may be a step forward, as they involve both EU funding
and national funds, even if their complexity is daunting
(see page 163). Indeed, the Joint Technology Initiatives,
combined with the European Research Council and
intense discussion on research infrastructure, might well
trigger a fundamental reconsideration of the framework
programmes and introduce a shift away from a very large
number of small projects towards funding of a few major
mechanisms. Greater funding for a truly independent
European Research Council, a theme which will also be
dealt with later, or maybe even more councils for different
fields of science, could be a better way of spending
research funds at the European level. Similarly, funds
could be better spent on large research facilities and on
concentrated, large-scale missions to tackle challenges for
Europe as a whole. A stronger European Research Council
will, of course, make the issue of the council’s relationship
to the national funding agencies and the consequences
for academically oriented research unavoidable. This issue
could have been conveniently dealt with at the time the
European Research Council was founded in 2006.

INSTITUTIONAL REFORM

Ratification of the Lisbon Treaty
The role of the EU in R&D has been defined in the various
treaties that have successively shaped the EU over the past 
50 years. The seeds of the EU were sown with the European
Coal and Steel Community and the European Atomic Energy
Community of the 1950s. These defined very specific
responsibilities in coal and steel and nuclear research. Only 
in the 1980s and 1990s did amendments to existing treaties
extend the EU’s responsibilities beyond industrial
competitiveness. 

The Lisbon Treaty was finally ratified by the last of the 27  EU
member states in November 2009. This treaty adds one major
responsibility: ‘The European Union shall draw up a European
space policy and measures to that effect may take the form of
a European space programme.’  How this will work out in
relation to the intergovernmental European Space Agency
will be a key issue for the next five years. 

European Union

Those member states which finance the European Space
Agency have accepted this new role for the EU, some
allegedly in anticipation of receiving financial contributions
from the EU for the functioning of the agency. This
enlargement of the scope of the EU’s responsibilities has gone
hand in hand with an increase in budgets (see page 160). 

One European reform that has been stalling is that
concerning patents. Everyone agrees that a community
patent is vital – that is, a patent filed with, and granted by, the
European Patent Office that would be valid throughout the
EU and offer the possibility of appealing a patent or litigating
for infringement via a single court preferably. Such a patent
has been under discussion since the 1970s and, in the past
few years, the European Commission has introduced
proposals to establish a community patent. However,
problems over language and jurisdiction have remained
unsurmountable hurdles: a national court has jurisdiction
and, up until recently, every member state could insist on an
official translation of any patent granted. With 27 members,
these requirements are no longer a viable option but not all
countries are prepared to admit this. Some progress has
been made in the area of translation especially: the 2008
London Agreement is an optional agreement among
members of the European Patent Convention which limits
the number of translations of a patent. A community patent
nevertheless remains a distant prospect. However, in
December 2009, ministers reached a political agreement on
a European patent including a European jurisdiction,
although some details will still have to be negotiated.

Reform of higher education

The Bologna Process
In many European countries, vast reforms have taken
place in the past decade. In others, they are still in
progress. These reforms affect the university sector in
particular, within the Bologna Process which intends to
create a European Higher Education Area by 2010 (Box 1).
The reforms include changes in funding mechanisms and
in university ties to enterprises. Key issues concern how to
foster diversity among universities, autonomy, quality,
quality assurance and evaluation, an outward orientation4

4. Universities with an outward orientation look for inspiration in research
to the key challenges societies are facing. They renew curricula with the
same perspective in mind and engage with companies and societal
organizations on the role universities should play. They also pay more
attention to the non-academic skills people need, such as communication
skills, a team spirit, entrepreneurial skills, etc.

UNESCO SCIENCE REPORT 2010

Box 1: The Bologna Process

The Bologna Process aims to create a
European Higher Education Area by
2010. The process got under way with
the adoption of the Bologna
Declaration in the Italian city of the
same name in June 1999. The three
priorities of the Bologna Process are:
the introduction of the three-cycle
system (bachelor’s + master’s +
doctorate); quality assurance; and
the recognition of qualifications and
periods of study across Europe.
Every second year, ministers

responsible for higher education in
the 46 ‘Bologna countries’ meet to
measure progress and set new
priorities. After Bologna (1999), they
met in Prague, Czech Republic (2001),
Berlin, Germany (2003), Bergen,
Norway (2005), London, UK (2007)
and Leuven/Louvain-la-Neuve,
Belgium (2009). The latter meeting
focused on the importance of lifelong
learning, widening access to higher
education and mobility. It was here
that the  2020 target was fixed for
ensuring that at least 20% of those
graduating in the European Higher
Education Area spend time abroad
studying or training.

Steered by European ministers
responsible for higher education, the
Bologna Process is a collective effort;
it also involves public authorities,
universities, teachers and students,
employers, quality assurance
agencies, international bodies and
institutions. Although the process
extends beyond the EU’s borders, it is
closely connected with EU policies
and programmes. For the EU, the
Bologna Process is part of a broader
effort to drive a ‘Europe of knowledge’.

In May 2006, the European

Commission urged ‘member states to
press on with the modernization of
Europe’s universities.The aim is to
increase our universities’ contribution
to the Lisbon Agenda for more growth
and more and better jobs,’ they said.
‘Europe’s 4 000 universities have
enormous potential, much of which
unfortunately goes untapped because
of various rigidities and hindrances.
The Commission is urging member
states to free up the EU’s substantial
reservoir of knowledge, talent and
energy with immediate, in-depth and
co-ordinated change: from the way in
which higher education systems are

regulated and managed to the ways in
which universities are governed.’
The EU is supporting a broad range of
measures to modernize the content
and practices of higher education in
the 27 member states and the EU’s
28 neighbouring countries. This
support includes the Lifelong
Learning Programme, the Instrument
for Pre-accession Assistance, the
European Neighbourhood and
Partnership Instrument and the
Development Cooperation
Instrument, the Tempus programme
and the EU’s programme for
worldwide academic co-operation,
Erasmus Mundus.

The EU is also supporting the

agenda for modernizing universities
through the implementation of FP7
and the Competitiveness and
Innovation Programme, as well as via
the structural funds and loans from
European Investment Bank.

and flexibility. These issues are clearly related. For
example, greater autonomy requires a better quality
assurance system. Similarly, a stronger outward
orientation and responsiveness are difficult to achieve
without greater autonomy and flexibility.

In Europe, there tends to be a general adhesion to the
idea that universities need greater autonomy. There is
unease in France, however, that this will translate into a
power shift from the professors to university
management, with administrators rather than faculty
deciding on the appointment of professors or on the
allocation of research funding. These concerns are
unfounded and reflect a lack of knowledge of

successful university systems abroad. Some have pointed
out that true autonomy can only come from the financial
autonomy obtained by a university that succeeds in
raising funds from private industry and other sources.

Most European universities have been built upon, or
adopted, the Humboldt model. This model is named after
Wilhelm von Humboldt (1767–1835), who designed the
Prussian education system which would later become a
model for university systems in Europe, Japan and the
USA. The Humboldt model advocates a unity of teaching
and research at the institutional, personnel and student
levels. Under the Humboldt model, academic training is
hardly conceivable without some involvement in research,

150

EU chapter [12] [P3]:Layout 1  20/10/10  11:22  Page 151

European Union

with the consequence that acquiring a university degree
can take many years. Of course, the expansion of
university systems to provide tertiary education to
growing numbers of students, combined with the need
for greater efficiency and cost-effectiveness, has inevitably
led to changes. The rhetoric emerging from many
discussions on universities, however, still reflects an
attachment to the Humboldt model, despite the fact that
it may not be sustainable. 

A comparison with the US higher education system makes
this abundantly clear. A good starting point is the now
well-known ranking of universities worldwide by
Shanghai Jiatong University. There is no need to discuss
here in detail the merits or demerits of this ranking, or for
that matter of any ranking. What matters is that the
criteria used for the Shanghai Jiatong ranking are based
on research capacity. When it comes to research, all
ranking systems would demonstrate that Europe spreads
its resources relatively thinly compared to the USA. 

It is obvious that American universities dominate
international rankings (Figure 1 and Table 2). Only when
we take into account the universities placed 51st to 100th
do we find a much better balance between Europe and
the USA. A more detailed comparison of two world-class
US universities (Stanford and the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology) with three top-tier European universities

(Cambridge in the UK, Eidgenössische Technische
Hochschule in Switzerland and Karolinska in Sweden)
suggests one important reason. Although the research
budgets of European universities are certainly
considerable, the budgets of the two US universities are
larger still. As a matter of fact, the National Science

UNESCO SCIENCE REPORT 2010

Foundation’s statistics on research at US universities reveal
that about 200 universities account for almost all university
research in the USA. Liberal arts colleges, community
colleges and others provide the bulk of tertiary education
(see page 45). 

The situation is very different in Europe. The ambition of many
universities is to become a research university, in line with the
prevailing ideal of what a university should be, based on the
Humboldt model. One example is Poland, which has
147 universities performing research, according to
ERAWATCH. The consequence of this is much fewer resources
for the average university. Jamil Salmi, Tertiary Education 
Co-ordinator within the World Bank’s Human Development
Network, concluded in a recent global analysis that world-
class universities share three key factors (Salmi, 2009). Firstly,
they have a concentration of top talent, both among faculty
and among students. Secondly, they have abundant
resources. Thirdly, they have appropriate governance systems.

Europe thus needs to foster greater diversity among its
universities and other institutions of higher learning.  Many of
the reforms European countries have witnessed over the past
decade have diversification as their goal, sometimes explicitly,
more often implicitly. Diversification has several components,
including the concentration of research funding. European
countries are still very reluctant to embrace this. Just as the
EU’s Framework Programmes have relied in many ways on
creating networks and other forms of collaboration to create
supposedly a critical mass, so too do most national
programmes and policies. Only in the UK has there been a
deliberate policy of augmenting the concentration of
research resources, as will be explained shortly. Even within
the UK, there has been a lot of opposition from the regions.
The policy has been diluted in any case since the distinction
between polytechnics and universities was abandoned in the
early 1990s. 

Eventually, the concentration of research funding in
selected universities will have to be accompanied by many
universities redefining themselves as the equivalent of
liberal arts colleges. This form of differentiation is certainly
made easier by the generalization of the bachelor’s and
master’s degree programmes at the heart of the Bologna
Process, which was adopted by European countries a
decade ago and is gradually being implemented in many
countries. However, in most countries, a bachelor’s degree
is still not regarded as a full university education by
students, parents and employers alike. 

152

A third dimension of differentiation is quality. Of course, no
one wants to be a low-quality institution. Currently, quality
assurance schemes are being introduced in most countries
to increase quality. However, it is simply impossible for every
university to belong to the top tier of research universities.
Moreover, there are some very good reasons for choosing a
different mission, for example to provide a region with good-
quality tertiary education. One very interesting example of a
country trying to increase institutional differentiation is
Germany with its ‘Exzellenz Initiative'. Responsibility for higher
education in Germany rests with the states. The federal
government therefore has to manoeuvre carefully to
introduce policies and schemes affecting higher education.
Thus, when the federal government arrived at the view that
the international competitiveness of German universities
required greater differentiation, it took lengthy discussions
with the states before they would agree, in 2005, to adhere to
the Exzellenz Initiative. In two rounds in 2005 and 2006,
universities were invited to submit three types of plan for
total additional funding of €2 billion. Relatively speaking, that
is perhaps not such an enormous amount but, in the
complex world of German policy-setting, and given the very
traditional position and organization of German universities,
the Exzellenz Initiative marks a significant evolution that is
representative of what is happening in other countries.
Graduate schools were introduced some 25 years ago as a
means of formalizing and improving PhD training. One
component of the Exzellenz Initiative was thus to select
39 excellent graduate schools over time. A second
component focused on clusters of excellence: research
groups in several disciplines and institutions within a region
were to create strong regional clusters. Thirty-seven such
clusters have been selected. These include a Nanosystems
Initiative in Munich, for instance, but also a cluster in
Heidelberg on Cultural Exchange in Europe and Asia in a
Global Context. The third and last component invited
universities to submit strategic plans for their institution as a
whole. Only nine universities have received this recognition.
Some five or six universities clearly stand out in terms of the
number of awards they have received for the three
components of the Exzellenz Initiative. 

Whatever one’s mission, appropriate governance systems
are vital for effectiveness. Autonomy is a key factor in this
regard. In a study carried out by the Bruegel Foundation,
the performance of European universities was analysed
and relations between governance, spending and
performance investigated (Aghion et al., 2007). The
conclusion was straightforward. European universities

EU chapter [12] [P3]:Layout 1  18/10/10  18:36  Page 153

European Union

must become more autonomous, in particular with
regard to budgets but also when it comes to hiring
faculty, remuneration, course design and student
selection, particularly at the master’s level. This process
towards more autonomy is ongoing.

augmenting its involvement in matters such as
nominations or even the promotion of staff in a draft
bill in 2007. Strong opposition led to the minister’s
resignation, however, so Slovenia may eventually lose
its status as the exception to the rule. 

ERAWATCH regularly collects data on developments in
the STI systems and policies of the EU member states on
the basis of reports by national correspondents. The 2008
ERAWATCH report summarizes key recent university
reforms. Covering a period between 2001 and 2008, it
lists formal legal reforms for 21 EU countries. Of these, 
16 explicitly mention autonomy as one of their objectives
or principles. Some examples follow:

I The Danish University Act of 2003 stipulated larger

autonomy for universities and the 2007 major
restructuring of Danish universities gave them greater
flexibility in the recruitment of researchers.

I In Spain, the Organic Law for universities of 2001
likewise increased the autonomy of universities.

I In Lithuania, higher education is currently undergoing
a reform that should be complete in 2010. The move is
towards greater autonomy, even though a high level
of regulation reportedly persists. 

I The 2005 Act on Higher Education in Poland brought

a much higher level of institutional autonomy.

I The French Law on University Responsibilities and

Freedom of 2007 afforded universities greater power
and responsibility for hiring staff; 20 universities were
the first to become autonomous in 2009. 

I The Higher Education Law of 2002 in Slovakia

introduced a major reform implying, inter alia, greater
institutional autonomy. This resulted in universities
becoming self-governing, self-organized entities.

I In Finland, the government response to concerns

about the lagging performance of Finnish universities
has been to introduce a development plan with
greater autonomy as one of its pillars, next to the
merger of institutions, for example. 

Autonomy goes hand in hand with accountability and
mechanisms for quality evaluation and quality assurance. In
practically all countries, government funding for university
research follows a dual approach. Next to institutional
funding, usually flowing directly from the government to
the universities, there is competitive funding provided by
one or more research councils or national funding agencies.
The balance between the two types of funding can be very
different from one country to another. In the United
Kingdom, for example, about £2.8 billion is funded by the
research councils and £1.5 billion comes in the form of
institutional funding through the higher education
research councils. To take another example, France created
a National Research Agency (Agence nationale de recherche)
in 2005 for funding exploratory research projects within
government-set priorities on a competitive basis. The aim is
to arrive at 20% competitive funding by 2010. Many of the
examples and data presented here are based on the
ERAWATCH 2008 country reports. 

Performance agreements
The focus in the present section has been on institutional
funds and attempts by countries to relate this funding in
some way to performance. For competitive funds, such a
relation is self-evident. Throughout the EU, we find a variety
of mechanisms. Performance agreements are one example.
Concluded for a period of three to five years, these
agreements have been introduced in recent years in
Austria, Denmark, Finland and Luxembourg, for example. 
In the latter case, a performance agreement was concluded
at the time of the founding of the University of
Luxembourg, the country’s first university. In each case, the
minister and the university agree on a sometimes vast
number of targets which the university accepts to achieve.
These may be quantitative and relate to education,
research, technology transfer and ties to industry, patents
and so on. As an example, Table 3 describes the
Development Contract for 2008–2010 signed by Aarhus
University and the Danish Minister for Science, Technology
and Innovation.

costs of training a bachelor in a three-year course. For
research, that is impossible and therefore the institutional
research budget is usually a lump sum resulting from
negotiations with the ministry on the basis of incremental
changes. As these agreements have only been introduced
recently, no evaluations have so far been carried out.

A very different scheme has been in use in the United
Kingdom since the early 1990s. In 2008, the latest in a series
of Research Assessment Exercises was held to decide about
the allocation to universities of the £1.5 billion pounds per
annum available as institutional research funding. This is a
highly competitive scheme with very strong incentives for
winners and penalties for losers. No country has so far

followed anything similar to the UK’s Research Assessment
Exercise. Even in the UK, the debate continues, as the swings
in funding from one period to the other can be significant
and therefore lead to effects that not everyone considers
beneficial in the long run. On the other hand, the scheme
does promote competition and a concentration of research
funding, both hallmarks of research in the top league. In the
Research Assessment Exercise, universities choose the units
of assessment (such as cardiovascular research) in which they
wish to submit proposals. In 2008, these units numbered 67.
A proposal consists of a number of researchers identified by
name, plus evidence of their quality as researchers in the
form of papers, citations or the number of PhD students
supervised, for example. There is no requirement to submit

154

EU chapter [12] [P3]:Layout 1  18/10/10  18:36  Page 155

all researchers active in a particular unit of assessment. 
The Higher Education Funding Councils have set up panels
to assess the individual researchers using a ‘star system’
ranging from four to zero stars. The upshot is that a group
ranked highest (four stars) gets seven times as much as a
group with an average ranking (two stars). As for groups with
a low ranking, they get nothing.

Only Poland has a system bearing some resemblance to
that of the UK. Institutional research funding is based on an
external assessment system. A fixed set of indicators is used
to evaluate performance over three years. Research units
are benchmarked against similar units in the same
discipline then ranked in five categories. Relatively less
money is involved, however, and the system is not as
severe, nor apparently as automatic, as the UK system. 

In most countries, however, there is only an indirect link
between institutional funding of university research and
performance. Moreover, when some form of formula
funding is used, this may involve, for example, the number
of PhD degrees conferred. That is the case, for instance, in
the Netherlands where institutional research funding for
universities is basically frozen at some historical level but
where around 25% is proportional to the number of PhD
degrees awarded by the university. That does not mean that
countries have not set up extensive evaluation mechanisms.
Indeed, this is one of the key developments of recent years.
Here again, some examples serve to illustrate the trend: Italy
has evaluated the research results of universities and public
research bodies from 2001 to 2003 but their impact on
policy and funding has been shown to be limited as yet. This
evaluation was carried out initially through a committee
established by the Ministry for Universities and Research
that has since been superseded by a National Agency for the
Evaluation of Universities and Research since 2008. Once it
becomes operational, the agency’s findings should guide
the allocation of public funds for research.

France, too, has moved away from a scattered evaluation
system towards the creation of a central Agency for
Evaluation of Research and Higher Education. This agency
will evaluate research at three levels: firstly, institutions
will be assessed, including their internal rules for staff
evaluation; secondly, the research units of both
universities and public research bodies will be evaluated
to the tune of around 1 000 per year; and thirdly, degrees
and diploma structures will be reviewed and lead to some
sort of accreditation of the programmes. How this will

European Union

affect institutional research funding remains to be seen.
Up until now, the universities have negotiated four-year
contracts with the ministry.

The Netherlands also has a national system for evaluating
research at universities and at the institutes conducting
academic research under the umbrella of the Royal Academy
for Arts and Sciences (KNAW) and the Netherlands
Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO) but the system
operates in a different way. The Association of Dutch
universities, KNAW and NWO agreed on a common protocol
in 2002: they accept evaluations, done at the level of research
groups, whenever a research group straddles both a
university and a research institute or could be evaluated in
two different scientific areas; they have established a
common cycle so that research groups in each discipline are
assessed once every six years. Moreover, there is a facilitating
organization they are at liberty to invite to organize the
evaluations. It is up to the management of a given university,
KNAW or NWO, however, to decide whether universities are
to have their research groups in a particular discipline
evaluated by the same international visitation committee or
whether they prefer a separate evaluation for their institution
only. Any financial consequences are the sole responsibility
of these management bodies. A university’s institutional
research budget being fixed without room for negotiation
with the ministry, management has to decide whether to
reallocate research budgets internally. This has been done to
a significant degree in recent years. In an interesting
development, the universities, KNAW and NWO have all
agreed recently to experiment with a broader assessment
protocol that explicitly measures not only the economic
impact but also the societal impact of research for those
groups and institutes with an explicitly societal mission. 

In Germany, there is no national system for evaluating
university research but, for all other public research, it is the
German Science Council which carries out evaluations. All
institutes belonging to renowned German research umbrella
organizations like the Max Planck Society are regularly
evaluated. In 2009, the Science Council was in the process of
completing an evaluation of the 50 or so government
research institutes. The Science Council’s assessments are
usually taken very seriously by research bodies. 

Finland is another country that has a thoroughly developed
system of research evaluation. Here, the Academy of Sciences
is responsible, next to the Technology Foundation (TEKES),
for technology development and innovation support

programmes. The Finnish academy is the equivalent of the
research funding councils or agencies in other countries.
Once every three years, the academy carries out an
evaluation of the entire research system in Finland, with
publication output being an important indicator. The Finnish
academy also assesses research at the programme level and
is increasingly looking not only at the immediate output but
also the longer-term impact of research. The academy also
evaluates scientific disciplines using a method similar to that
employed in the Netherlands: foreign expert panels assess a
large number of research groups on past performance. 

The results of the various assessments serve as input for
the performance contracts that accompany institutional
government funding but there are no algorithms
involved. Many more examples could be given for most of
the EU member states but the trend is clear from just this
handful of countries: more explicit evaluations;
evaluations at various levels, such as research groups,
programmes, disciplines or institutions; a variety of
mechanisms to link performance to institutional research
budgets; and, increasingly, attempts to extend the scope
of evaluations to the longer-term and societal impact.

EUROPEAN CO-OPERATION 
AND INTEGRATION TAKE OFF

In this section, we shall be describing a number of
European schemes for collaboration and issues like the
development of research infrastructure which are based
on agreements between governments or between
national funding agencies. We shall then move on to the
EU’s role in fostering collaboration in R&D.

The region continues to develop the European dimension of
what, in the past, were purely national landscapes of
universities, research institutes, companies, research funding
agencies, policies and regulations. Over the past two
decades, Europe has witnessed a much greater degree of
co-operation among researchers in different European
countries. The EU’s Framework Programmes, about which
more will be said later, have played a key role in this respect.
The new European Research Council is an important
development at the institutional level, although it is not yet
a complete success. The jury is also still out on another
institution, the European Institute of Innovation and
Technology. Major S&T-based services and industries have
also often acquired a European flavour. 

156

One very visible example of pan-European research is the
aircraft manufacturer Airbus. The company is the result of a
merger by the formerly independent aircraft companies of
four European countries, France, Germany, Spain and the
UK. Airbus employs about 57 000 people. It produces about
half of the world’s jet airliners and is credited with designing
the biggest airline jet in the world, the A380, which, despite
delays, was delivered to its first customer in 2007. The
company has subsidiaries in China, Japan and the USA. 

Also in the transport sector, high-speed train services are
spreading their net ever wider across Europe. These are
one of the transeuropean networks that have been
identified in the EU treaties as essential infrastructure for
Europe. Of course, operational costs and investment in
these railways are borne by the rail companies concerned. 

Information infrastructure is another area in which
pan-European co-operation is bearing fruit. GÉANT is the
pan-European data communication infrastructure via which
all the national research and education networks (NRENs) in
Europe co-operate. Through it, they are connected to each
other and to like networks around the world. The third phase
was launched in December 2009. It promises to provide
Europe with highly advanced networking services for
education and research for the coming years. Its
development, construction and operating costs are half
funded by the NRENs themselves and half by the EU
through its FP7. 

One sector to watch in coming years will be nuclear energy.
With the energy crisis and current concerns about global
warming, governments seem to be reassessing their
position on nuclear energy, which they now see as a realistic
option. How the EU nuclear reactor industry positions itself
will be a vital question. So far, the nuclear reactor industry
has been dominated by Areva in France and Siemens in
Germany, two companies which co-operated until early
2009 via a joint venture. Areva and Siemens have both put a
lot of effort into what was first termed the European
Pressurized Water Reactor then the Evolutionary Pressurized
Reactor and now simply EPR. However, the first two EPR
reactors under construction, one in Finland and the other in
France, are facing very costly and lengthy delays linked to
the redesigning of part of the reactor. 

The EU has vowed to slash carbon emissions by 20%
compared to 1990 levels by 2020 and indicated that it
would be prepared to commit to greater cuts if other high

EU chapter [12] [P3]:Layout 1  18/10/10  18:36  Page 157

European Union

emitters like the USA and China do the same. The EU will
essentially have recourse to the carbon trading
mechanism to meet this target. However, everyone seems
to agree that, if we are serious about keeping global
temperature rise this century to a manageable 2 °C, this
will mean cutting back emissions by 80–90% by 2050 then
achieving negative emissions by 2080. The latter target is
not impossible but would require drastic measures. If the
EU follows this more ambitious path, it will need to
invest massively in R&D in the coming years to develop
clean energy technologies that can be deployed on a
large scale.

One recent development at the European level will have
major repercussions for the chemicals industry. On 
1 January 2007, the European Community adopted the
Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of
Chemical Substances (REACH). The aim of REACH is to
improve the protection of human health and the
environment by obliging chemical companies to declare
the intrinsic properties of chemical substances. In parallel,
REACH sets out to enhance the innovative capability and
competitiveness of the EU chemicals industry. Information
is amassed in a central database run by the European
Chemicals Agency in Helsinki, Finland.

After many years of deliberations, the EU has also reached
a decision, at last, as to the fate of Galileo, a state-of-the-
art, autonomous global satellite navigation system which
will provide autonomous navigation and positioning
services, interoperable with the Global Positioning System
(GPS) and the Global Navigation Satellite System
(GLONASS). The first Galileo test satellite was launched by
the European Space Agency in September 2009. 

Europe’s international research organizations
Various countries in Europe have built up large research
organizations since the Second World War (Table 4). The
founding of these centres was partly politically motivated
but also responded to an economic reality underlying the
scientific arguments: in many areas, investment in R&D
had simply become too expensive for individual countries
to bear. The one exception to the rule is the European
Molecular Biology Laboratory. Here, the problem was not
the size of the investment required but rather the
disciplinary rigidity of university structures, which meant
they had difficulty accommodating the new
‘interdiscipline’ of molecular biology. 

The seven largest laboratories are the European
Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN); European

Box 2: The International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor

The project for an International
Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor
(ITER) involves China, the European
Union, India, Japan, the Republic of
Korea, Russian Federation and the USA.
The most ambitious collaborative
project in science ever conceived, ITER 
is developing a reactor which will cost
€10 billion to construct and run for its
anticipated lifetime.
Once operational, this experimental
reactor will be powered by nuclear

fusion, a technology which could
change the face of nuclear power,
Nuclear reactors currently use nuclear
fission which, unlike nuclear fusion,
produces radioactive waste. 

However, nuclear fusion has yet
to be fully mastered. This is because
nuclei strongly resist being brought
close together, owing to of their
positive charge induced by their
protons. The ITER reactor would need
to accelerate the nuclei to high

enough speeds to overcome this
electromagnetic repulsion until the
nuclei came close enough to achieve
fusion. 

In 2006, the project partners
opted to build the reactor in the
town of Cadarache in France,
reflecting Europe’s leading role in
thermonuclear fusion. Construction
should be completed by about 2018.

For details: www.iter.org

Fusion Development Agreement; European Molecular
Biology Laboratory; European Space Agency; European
Organisation for Astronomical Research in the Southern
Hemisphere; European Synchrotron Radiation Facility; and
the Institut Laue Langevin. A couple of years ago, these
organizations formed EIROforum, a platform for
improving their visibility in European policy discussions,
among other goals.

These laboratories are considered to be among the best in
the world. With the exception of the European Space
Agency (ESA), they are all dedicated R&D organizations. 
In tandem with its specific research mission, ESA is, of
course, like all major space agencies, involved in technology
development, the construction and operation of launchers
and spacecraft, and in supporting European space policy.

All but the European Fusion Development Agreement are
intergovernmental bodies. That is, they have been
established by an ad hoc group of countries whose
governments have concluded an international agreement
to establish a research organization, with representatives
of these governments forming a council which acts as the
supreme administrative and strategy-determining body. 

Thermonuclear fusion is the only area in which the European
Commission has real authority. It is also the only area in which
a substantial part of European R&D budgets are concentrated
within EU mechanisms. Since the 1950s, national fusion
programmes have been co-funded and strongly co-ordinated
by this central mechanism. This has given Europe a leading
position in developing and now also hosting the €10 billion

International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor currently
being built in France (Box 2). EFDA is now is focusing on co-
ordination, including the collective use of the Joint European
Tokamak for as long as this, the largest current R&D fusion
facility, remains operational.

As far as the other intergovernmental European research
organizations are concerned, the major event of the past
five years has no doubt been the inauguration of CERN’s
Large Hadron Collider in the autumn of 2008. This new
accelerator is also a global collaborative effort and will be
the world’s leading particle physics facility for the next 
15 years or so with operations having resumed in late
2009 after initial technical problems. 

One other European research laboratory stands out, the
Joint Research Centre of the EU with five locations in Ispra
(Italy), Karlsruhe (Germany), Mol (Belgium), Petten
(Netherlands) and Seville (Spain). It differs from the
EIROforum research organizations in that it is not
concerned with operating large user research facilities.
More will be said about it in the section on funding R&D in
the EU (see page 160).

A road map for research infrastructure
The policy discussion on new research infrastructure has
become intense in Europe. In 2002, the EU member states
and the European Commission decided to establish a
European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructure
(ESFRI). ESFRI consists of high-level officials from the EU
member states and the Commission. Taking the 20-year
Facilities Outlook of the US Department of Energy as an

158

EU chapter [12] [P3]:Layout 1  18/10/10  18:36  Page 159

example,5 ESFRI published a Road Map of 35 new research
facilities or upgrades to existing ones in 2006, ‘research
infrastructures’ in the European jargon. The construction
of these new facilities was considered as being vital for
consolidating Europe’s competitive edge in R&D. The
ESFRI Road Map was updated in December 2008 and now
contains 44 facilities. The coverage is much wider than for
the US report: materials and analytical facilities for
physical and engineering sciences; facilities for the
medical and biological sciences; infrastructure for social
sciences and humanities, as well as for energy,
environmental sciences and so on. 

Much of this infrastructure will be distributed. An example is a
project in which biobanks across Europe form effectively one
big European biobank. For all these reasons, construction
and operating costs vary widely. Next to traditional facilities
for neutrons, synchrotron radiation or astronomy, which
would each cost €1 billion or more to build, the Road Map
contains projects like the European Social Survey, a
collaboration for continuing the co-ordinated, harmonized
gathering of survey data to monitor social attitudes and
value changes in a large number of European countries, a
project measured in only a few tens of millions of euros.

Only two of the major new facilities featuring on the Road
Map have been decided so far, the X-ray Free Electron Laser
Synchrotron (X-FEL) in Hamburg, Germany, and a facility for
studying rare isotope radioactive beams, also in Germany.
A third, the European Neutron Spallation Source (ESS),
which will be built in Lund in Sweden, was at an advanced
stage of the decision-making process in November 2009. 

This shows that the basic problem in Europe remains
unresolved. There is no mechanism in place yet for
deciding on investment in large research infrastructure
that is financially beyond the reach of individual countries
in a reasonably transparent and efficient manner. Many
governments are unwilling to create a substantial role for
the EU, the European Commission is not always eager to
accept such a role and national funding agencies haven’t
found a structural way of co-operating in these matters
either. One consequence is that no EU money is currently
available to contribute to funding new research facilities.

5.  Published in late 2003, the Facilities Outlook contained a priority list of
28 new user facilities or upgrades to existing facilities, ranging from ITER to
accelerators, neutron and synchrotron sources, facilities for nuclear
magnetic resonance and high performance computers.

European Union

European Science Foundation
The European Science Foundation (ESF) differs not only
from the intergovernmental research bodies described
above but also from its US namesake, the National Science
Foundation. With an annual budget of only about 
€50 million, it doesn’t really fund research. The European
Science Foundation is an association of 80 members
composed of national funding agencies, academies of
sciences and arts and so-called research performing
bodies like the Max Planck Organization in Germany. It has
positioned itself as the agenda-setting body for science in
Europe, via foresight studies. It also stimulates co-
operation among scientists to implement these science
agendas through various programmes. One example is
EUROCORES, a programme which brings together
national funding that is thus not included in ESF’s 
€50 million budget. 

The ESF also operates the COST programme, which
consumes the lion’s share of the ESF’s €50 million budget.
Officially, COST is an intergovernmental programme
which funds co-ordinating activities like workshops in
specific areas agreed upon by the COST High Level Group.
In practice, however, the intergovernmental aspect seems
to be rather irrelevant, like the EU Community aspect.
Partly within, partly without the ESF, the heads of the
national funding agencies have created a mechanism for
strengthening co-operation among themselves. They
themselves are known as the European Heads of 
Research Councils (EUROHORCS). This is a source of
persistent confusion but the problem will have to be
resolved in the broader context of a debate on the mutual
roles of the ESF, the recently established European
Research Council – much more comparable to the
National Science Foundation in the USA than the ESF –
and the national funding agencies or research councils.
More will be said later about this issue.

E U R E K A
EUREKA was established in 1985. It was initially a French
response to US President Reagan’s ‘Star Wars’ Strategic
Defense Initiative. EUREKA has since developed into a pan-
European mechanism for stimulating innovation in industry
through close-to-the-market collaboration between small,
medium-sized and large enterprises, universities and
research institutes. It is another intergovernmental initiative
in which the European Commission is just one of several
partners. The relationship between the EU and EUREKA
continues to be a bone of contention.

Companies and research bodies are invited to propose
innovative projects for the EUREKA label, formally granted
by the EUREKA ministers, and for limited government
financial support. The latter is awarded strictly on a
national basis, with levels of support and conditions for
attribution differing widely. The EU does provide some
additional financial support but always on a case-by-case
basis, despite repeated attempts to come to an
agreement on a general support scheme. 

EUREKA functions along two lines: bottom-up projects
proposed by individual companies, and strategic projects,
of which there are two types, EUREKA clusters and
umbrellas. The latter involve collaboration among a
number of countries, which invite companies and research
bodies to develop and submit proposals in specific areas.
EUREKA clusters are strategic associations of usually large
companies, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs),
universities and research institutes (Table 5). 

European Institute of Innovation and Technology
Something must be said about the European Institute of
Innovation and Technology, simply because it has been a
focus of policy attention since 2005. Conceived by the
president of the European Commission as a direct
counterpart to, and copy of, the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology (MIT) in the USA, the European Institute of
Innovation and Technology has provoked much debate.
The underlying assumptions of both the European and
US reality have been questioned with great passion.
Tindemans et al. (2007) provide an in-depth discussion on
this subject. Does Europe really lack an ‘MIT’? Is it true that
industry contract funding is the defining difference

160

between US and European university research funding?
Doesn’t Europe have very good examples of its own of
institutions integrating research, education and
conditions for innovation? The answer to all these
questions is ‘no’.

As a backdrop to this debate, Table 2 provides some
interesting data. Science parks such as those in Cambridge
(UK) and Leuven (Belgium) further substantiate the idea that
the rationale behind the European Institute of Innovation
and Technology, namely that a solid institution linking
training, research and the promotion of innovation is missing
in Europe, is not that straightforward. 

It was nevertheless decided in 2007 to establish the
European Institute of Innovation and Technology as a
distributed organization where the activities would take
place at many locations across Europe. The European
Institute of Innovation and Technology’s key units will be
so-called Knowledge and Innovation Communities. Each
of these communities will consist of a number of teams
formed from companies, universities and research
institutes. Each member of a team is not supposed to
work from his or her own home base but rather cluster at
a few specific locations. Strong leadership and
management should make the difference with other
mechanisms of decentralized co-operation. A Governing
Board has been appointed and the institute’s
headquarters are being set up in Budapest, Hungary.
Three proposals for creating Knowledge and Innovation
Communities were selected in December 2009 on a
competitive basis in three areas: climate change
mitigation and adaptation; sustainable energy; and the
future information and communication society. So far,
€300 million has been made available as additional
funding from the EU for the first five-year phase. The
remainder of the estimated €1.5 billion or so will have to
come from partners and from competitive European or
national funds.

The EU’s role in fostering R&D
In recent decades, the EU has built up a considerable
position in funding R&D in Europe. The real take-off took
place in the early 1980s when the ESPRIT programme was
set up to lure the 10 or so largest European companies in
micro-electronics and information technology into a mode
of co-operating in pre-competitive research. Soon
afterwards, the idea of a Framework Programme was
conceived to simplify the political decision-making

EU chapter [12] [P3]:Layout 1  18/10/10  18:36  Page 161

process. In the past, the Council of Ministers, with the
involvement of the European Parliament, had to agree
unanimously on each separate programme in
information technology (IT), telecommunications,
health and so on. Successive Framework Programmes,
the first six each covering a four-year period, the current
seventh a seven-year period to 2013, have each been
intended to embrace virtually all of the EU’s R&D efforts. 

There are two more programmes from which R&D-
related projects can be funded. One is the
Competitiveness and Innovation Framework
Programme. It focuses largely on helping SMEs to find
venture capital and other forms of funding, adopt
advanced solutions using information and
communication technologies (ICTs) and increase both
energy efficiency and innovative approaches to
renewable energy. Given its scope and the fact that it
represents only about 7% of FP7, it will not be dealt
with further. 

That is also the case for the second additional
mechanism. For a long time, European structural funds
have been part and parcel of the European integration
machinery. Their basic purpose is to help lagging
regions in both new and older member states catch up
and thereby, as the jargon goes, increase cohesion
throughout the EU. Although allocating money to this
cohesion policy is always a highly politically charged
decision, there is an underlying rationale: to identify
those regions that are eligible for support using criteria
such as income or industrial decline. Countries have a
relatively free hand in establishing a programme of
activities for receiving support. Moreover, countries are
increasingly using these funds to help improve their
knowledge infrastructure by investing in universities,
science parks or even research facilities. The innocent
traveller should not be surprised to come across a sign
saying ‘Co-funded by the European Regional Fund’ in
sometimes rather improbable places. No detailed
comprehensive information is available, however, on
the extent to which R&D activities or investment are
funded in this way. The rest of the discussion will thus
be concentrated on the Framework Programme.

Most EU funding is competitive and meant for research
by companies, universities or research institutes
throughout the EU member states, the candidate
member countries and countries that have signed

European Union

association treaties with the EU. The latter basically
implies that, once these countries have paid up what
would be their GDP-proportional share of the Framework
Programme budget, they are then free to compete for
projects. Part of the budget is for the EU’s own in-house
Joint Research Centre. 

The philosophy behind the Framework Programme has
never been simply to fund the best and/or most relevant
research. There have always been two meta-goals, as it
were. Stimulating co-operation between researchers and
between companies, universities and research institutes
across the participating states was one such goal and co-
ordinating national research efforts and policies was the
other. As a consequence, much emphasis has always
been placed on conditions that researchers often did not
feel comfortable with. The obligation to include
researchers from several member states led to the
formation of very large teams and it was not evident that
these comprised the best people for the task at hand. The
idea of co-ordination was translated to mean copious
support for all sorts of networks with all their trappings:
co-ordination meetings, workshops and so on.
The  current FP7 consists of six big chunks: Co-operation;
Ideas; People; Capacities; Civil Nuclear Activities (fusion,
fission, radiation protection); and Non-nuclear Activities of
the Joint Research Centre. 

Table 6 shows the structure and the budget of FP7.
Formally, the nuclear activities, including fusion, are part
of a separate legal mechanism but that distinction is
irrelevant here. To put the EU funding in perspective, it is
helpful to compare the budget of FP7 to total public
funding for R&D. The national governments’ budget
appropriations for R&D (GBAORD) for the EU-27
amounted to €81.3 billion in 2005. The total budget of
FP7 has two components: €50.5 billion is allocated for a
seven-year term and €2.7 billion for a five-year term.
By extrapolation, this amounts to an annual average of
about €7.7 billion, or approximately 8–8.5% of public
funding for R&D. The average annual budget involved
with the Framework Programme and the large
intergovernmental research organizations mentioned
previously amounts to about 10–10.5% of public
funding. This underlines the point that national funding
still dominates, even though EU funds are usually  required to
match national funding. The same point is illustrated by the
fact that the budgets of the national funding agencies like
the UK research councils or the German Research Association

combined are of the order of 25% of public funding for R&D.
This highlights a key policy issue within the EU which has so
far been largely ignored: what should the role of the EU really
be in relation to national funding sources and what should
the role of national funding agencies be in achieving co-
ordination between national funding sources?

European Research Council
Despite the still relatively limited role of the EU budgets
for R&D, important developments are taking place which
are at the heart of current policy debates in the EU. 
The major debate concerns the European Research
Council (ERC), formally established in December 2006
when its seven-year budget of €7.5 billion was approved
as part of FP7. The ERC is a genuine funding agency.
Although it is still run as a formal Executive Agency of the

EU, it is led by an independent Scientific Council
consisting of some 20 scientists. The council sets policy,
defines the scientific strategy and establishes the
methods for reviewing the applications for funding. 

Currently, the ERC has two funding schemes, Starting
Grants for young researchers setting up a small research
group and Advanced Grants for established researchers. 
For the first time, Europe has recognized that the
promotion of scientific research of the highest calibre
requires a European-wide competition, as opposed to
national competitions. Moreover, the way in which these
funding schemes operate is fundamentally different from the
‘normal’ FP7 programmes: scientific excellence is the only
criterion; there is no requirement to collaborate with other
researchers from different countries and the contributions

are grants rather than contracts with deliverables. The ERC
has by now financed one round of some 300 starting grants
for an average amount of €1 million and one round of an
equal number of advanced grants for an average of about 
€2 million. As could be expected, the distribution of these
grants over the various countries is very uneven. As an
example, Figure 2 shows the number of starting grants per
million inhabitants of the host country of the institution at
which the principal investigator works.

The Joint Technology Initiatives
The Joint Technology Initiatives (JTI) build on the
technology platforms which were formed on a
competitive basis in the EU’s Sixth Framework Programme
(FP6). Each initiative is an alliance among what tends to be
a large number of companies, universities and research
institutes throughout Europe, with the aim of establishing
a strategic research agenda in a particular domain. In
order to create strong public–private partnerships to
implement a few of these agendas in strategic areas, the
European Commission and the member states have
defined six Joint Technology Initiatives. A large impact on

European Union

industrial competitiveness and growth; important
contributions to broader policy and societal objectives; a
strong financial and resource commitment from industry;
and the capacity to attract additional national support
were among the criteria used to identify the following
JTIs: Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI), Embedded
Computing Systems (Artemis), Aeronautics and Air
Transport (Clean Sky), Nanoelectronics Technologies 2020
(ENIAC), the Hydrogen and Fuel Cells Initiative (FCH) and
Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES). 

A JTI is known as a ‘joint undertaking’, a rather
complicated European legal structure. On top of that, it is
cumbersome to create, one reason being that ordinary
citizens, companies or organizations cannot decide by
themselves to create a joint undertaking; the Council of
Ministers and the European Parliament have to be
involved. Yet companies on the whole are of the opinion
that JTIs could be an important step forward in
establishing the necessary critical mass and helping to
leverage national funding. Take the example of Artemis.
About 20 countries participate in Artemis, as well as the
European Commission and a dedicated industrial
foundation of some 100 members, 50% of which are
companies. A 10-year R&D programme costing €2.5 billion
has been defined, with funding from the participants and
national governments, together with some €500 million
from FP7. The Board of the Artemis Joint Undertaking will
select projects for funding from proposals submitted by
groups of members of the foundation. JTIs might mark a
new phase in the efforts to increase co-ordination
between national programmes and funding mechanisms,
something which has always been an elusive goal of
official EU policies for STI.

NATIONAL AND REGIONAL
DIFFERENCES IN R&D 

Differences in gender balance
Within the EU, there are yawning differences between
countries when it comes to the share of women among
researchers, be it in industry, academia or government
institutes. As we can see from Figure 3, the range extends
from fewer than 25% of researchers being female to about
50%. There has been little improvement in the EU-15
countries over the years. However, the countries which
acceded to the EU in 2004 have now set a faster pace,
particularly the Baltic States and countries of Central and

Eastern Europe, with the notable exception of the Czech
Republic. In traditional R&D strongholds like Germany or
France, the participation rate of women in R&D is even
much lower than the EU average. 

comes to the performance of R&D. Here, industry shares
tend to be somewhat higher than for R&D funding, since
public support for R&D in industry usually outweighs
industry outsourcing to universities, for example.

Differences in GERD
There are also large variations between countries when it
comes to funding R&D. Incidentally, it should be noted
that all of the organizations, laboratories or research
funding programmes at the European level are taken into
account in the data on GERD, research personnel, patents
and so on collected on a per-country basis, as there is no
separate geographical administrative domain beyond the
countries in Europe.

As Figure 4 and Table 7 demonstrate, the GERD/GDP ratio
varies from less than 0.5% in Bulgaria, Cyprus and Slovakia
to more than 3.4% in Finland and Sweden. The share of R&D
financed by industry represents less than 30% of GERD in
some countries and almost 70% in others. It is no accident
that the GERD/GDP ratio is highest precisely in those
countries where industry contributes much more than 50%
of GERD: Sweden, Finland, Germany and Denmark. Austria
is the only real exception. So is Luxembourg, in fact, but
Luxembourg is statistically an exception in many respects.
In most of the newer member states, the share of industry is
negligible, with the notable exception of the Czech
Republic and Slovenia. We can see a similar pattern when it

Many of these differences in GERD and related indicators
should be nuanced, however. They should come as no
surprise and need not be a cause for concern. One simply
cannot expect all countries to devote the same share of
GDP to R&D. Nor is this the case within countries, as shall
become apparent later from the regional innovation 
index (see page 169). 

Europe should compare itself to the USA, China or Japan.
Natural comparative advantages like lying on the
seaboard and historical developments have been the
cause of wide regional differences. As far as R&D is
concerned, the federal funding sources continue to be a
critical factor in keeping the US R&D system fairly
concentrated both in terms of institutions and geography.
The same can be said for the private equivalent of federal
funding sources in the form of large private foundations.
In Europe, it is understandable but unsustainable for
almost all countries (and often regions within countries)
to have a tendency to build their national systems on
research-based universities and research institutes,
to copy each other’s priorities and to want to host large
research facilities. This situation does define a key policy

Differences in innovation performance
In the meantime, it is now possible to describe the
differences between EU member states in a much more
sophisticated way than before, thanks to the Summary
Innovation Index (opposite). Following work carried out
by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD) in the 1990s to develop indicators
that measure R&D input, throughput and output, and
later the innovation process, a methodology was
developed to try to capture the relative position of
countries, the Summary Innovation Index. This index is
modified slightly each time it is put together but the
methodology is now stable enough to allow
comparisons over a number of years. 

If one looks at the performance of the innovation leaders,
followers, moderate innovators and catching-up countries,
the differences between the four categories are fairly
consistent: innovation followers score less than leaders for
each of the components and so on (Figures 5 and 6). The
two figures may also be used to illustrate that scoring high
on innovation is not per se the only route to prosperity.
Norway is the obvious example. Its score shows that high
income from natural resources can go hand in hand with an
advanced economy and a highly educated population.

A correlation between specialization and public
R&D funding
Innovation performance is a generic characteristic of a
country’s economy and does not look at the strength of
individual sectors. But most countries do have a certain
specialization, of course (Table 8). Finland, for example, is
extremely strong in ICTs. Does government expenditure
on R&D reflect this? Data can show government spending
on R&D, known in EU jargon as Government Budgetary
Appropriations for R&D (GBAORD), broken down by
socio-economic objective. However, a key problem is
whether to classify medium- or longer-term strategic or
application-oriented research as ‘non-oriented’ or even as
‘research financed from general university funds’ or as
sector-related research. For the most recent year for
which data are available, Hungary identifies just 14.1 % of
government expenditure on R&D as being financed from
general university funds and non-oriented research
combined, whereas, in many countries, these two
categories alone account for more than 60% of the total
(Table 9). Clearly, such a discrepancy between countries
in reality is unlikely. Yet it is possible to see some sector
realities reflected in the data.

UNESCO SCIENCE REPORT 2010

Trends in funding defence research 
Defence research tends to be relatively easy to identify,
with marked differences among the EU member states
reflecting the importance each country accords to its
defence industry. For the EU-27 overall, 13.3% of
government spending on R&D is classified as ‘defence’
spending but four countries spend substantially more
than the others: the UK (31.0%), France (22.3%), Sweden
(17.4%) and Spain (16.4%). 

Trends in funding research on agricultural production and
technology
Agricultural production, which includes hunting, forestry
and fisheries, is still relatively important for many of the
countries that acceded to the EU in 2004. According to
Eurostat (2008), the annual growth rate of added value
at constant prices over 2000–2006 averaged 6.7% in
Hungary, 10.9% in Slovakia and 3.8% in Poland, for
example, whereas, in most of the older member states,
production either declined or remained relatively stable.
Government spending on ‘agricultural production and
technology’ is on average much higher in the new
member states: Cyprus (23.5%), Latvia (17.5%), Hungary
(16.4%) and Slovakia (11.5%). Noteworthy is that Poland
is an exception to the rule, at 1.3%, but then Poland
classifies a full 77% as research financed from general
university funds. Among the old member states, only a

handful devote a considerable percentage of expenditure
to agricultural research. Unsurprisingly, these are Ireland,
the Netherlands and Denmark but also Iceland, Portugal
and Greece (on Greece, see page 190). The percentage for
Iceland is even 21.3%. 

Trends in funding energy research
Turning to energy research, even though it seems likely
that budgets will be rising in the near future, the 2005
data show only small amounts of funding for the
‘production, distribution and rational utilization of
energy’. A few countries stand out, however: Hungary
devotes 10.4% to this sector but this is probably relatively
distorted, firstly because of the very small amount of
‘research financed from general university funds’ and,
secondly, in light of the percentages for non-oriented
research. Other examples are Finland (4.8%), France (4%)
and Italy (4.0%). By contrast, Germany’s share is low, at
1.8%, and that of the UK even  lower: 0.4%. The nuclear
industry and nuclear power as such no doubt have much
to do with these differences, although in the case of the
UK, there may  be a grey area between identifying
research as ‘energy’ or ‘defence’.

Trends in funding industrial production and technology
The data for ‘industrial production and technology’ and for
‘protection and improvement of human health’ are,

* Luxembourg does not feature in this table despite its high GERD/GDP ratio because its productivity is low, just 192 scientific articles across all major fields

however, much more equivocal and probably marred
by classification problems. Take the case of ‘industrial
production and technology’. It is no accident that 
the very high figures for Belgium (33.4%), Finland
(26.1%), Lithuania (21.0%) and Hungary (19.6%)
seem to coincide with the relatively low to very low
percentages for ‘research financed from general
university funds’ and ‘non-oriented research’
combined. Germany, Sweden and the UK would be
expected to occupy a strong position but the first
two have considerably higher levels of ‘research
financed from general university funds’ and ‘non-
oriented research’ figures than those for industrial
production and technology, even though Germany’s
share, at 12.6%, is still considerable. In the case of the
UK, its very high defence research component may
partly explain the difference. In a  similar vein, it is
hard to believe that the widely varying figures for
‘protection and improvement of human health’ in
the UK (14.6%), but extremely low figures for 
Sweden (1.0%) or Belgium (1.9%), reflect realities in
health care.

Regional differences in innovation
The analysis of innovation performance along the lines
of the Summary Innovation Index has been extended
to European regions (Hollanders, 2006). Several words

of caution are in order at this point, pertaining to the
incomparable administrative definition of regions in
different countries. In Belgium, for example, the whole of
Flanders and the whole of the Walloon Region are
counted as a single region, whereas, in the  Netherlands,
12 provinces are each considered to be a region.
Nevertheless, two key results stand out. In the first place,
it becomes evident that there is an enormous variety
within each of the EU member states. Whether one
considers countries scoring high on the Summary
Innovation Index for the country as a whole, such as
Sweden or Finland, or countries that fare less well in  this
respect, such as the moderate innovators Greece and
Portugal, the variation between regions within each
country remains considerable. This illustrates the fact that
striving for a homogeneous performance in innovation is
a totally unrealistic goal and not  necessary for a relatively
homogeneous distribution of prosperity in a country.
Secondly, regions that are performing very well can be
found throughout the EU and not just in the old member
states. Prague and Bratislava score as high as the best-
performing region in the Netherlands, Noord-Brabant,
which owes part of its score to the fact that several large
companies – and Philips first and foremost – have
installed large  research laboratories in the  region.
This illustrates the point that making a judicious choice of
specialization and sticking to it  does pay off.

Catching up within the EU: 
spotlight on the newcomers
The position of the last 12 newcomers to the EU has
already received some attention in earlier sections but,
here, we shall examine their situation a little more closely.
Table 10 highlights the situation for some key indicators.
In most cases, the newcomers show relatively high GDP
growth rates. Otherwise, no consistent picture emerges.
Countries are simply too different to appear in an orderly,
homo geneous way in such a comparison. Yet a few
conclusions do seem possible. Estonia and Latvia in
particular, but also the third Baltic country, Lithuania, as
well as Cyprus, have done very well for all the indicators in
Table 10. For the Baltic countries, the question is whether
and how these trends will continue, as these countries are
among the hardest hit by the current global economic
recession. 

Business expenditure on R&D is growing considerably in
most countries. Of course, this growth is starting from a
very low level in almost all cases and, in several countries,
foreign subsidiaries account for much of the investment
in R&D. Nevertheless, the data show that private-sector
investment in R&D has taken hold, with the remarkable
exception of Slovakia and, less surprisingly, Romania,
which faces demanding challenges. 

The GERD/GDP ratio has increased in most of the 12 new
EU countries but not in Slovakia, given the considerable
decline in business expenditure, nor in Bulgaria or Poland.
Doctoral degrees are on the rise in all but two countries:
in Malta, they are down considerably but, for such a small
country, there could be many explanations; in Hungary,
this unexpected situation may be related to the reduction
in public expenditure on R&D. 

One particular area in which most of the most recent
member states still have a long way to go concerns
linkages between universities and public research
institutes with private enterprises. That should come as no
surprise. For most of the countries formerly belonging to
the Council of Mutual Economic Assistance (COMECON)6
in the era of state enterprises, there were few ties, as they
relied on their own state laboratories and private
enterprises were scarce. As for Cyprus and Malta, these are
small countries with economies which are not strongly
based on innovation and technology. Among the
indicators used for the European Innovation Scoreboard,
only one really captures these linkages between
universities or public research institutes and private
enterprises. This is the number of public–private co-
publications, that is, publications where one or more
authors from a university or a public research institute are

involved and at least one from a private enterprise. 
Table 11 reveals the current position of the latest 
12 member states for this indicator and growth rates 
over the past five years. The number of public–private 
co-publications per million inhabitants should be put in
perspective by comparing these figures with the
performance of the highest-ranking EU countries: Sweden
(116.1), Denmark (108.7), the Netherlands (83.7) and
Finland (83.1). Slovenia is not far off the EU-27 average of
31.4 and Hungary, Estonia and the Czech Republic are well
on their way to achieving this target but all the other
countries are far behind. Nor would it be kind to compare
these scores with Switzerland’s score of 193.1 per million
inhabitants. Nevertheless, growth rates among the
newcomers are mostly positive to very positive.

A boost from EU structural funds 
Making available EU structural funds is one of the key
mechanisms by which the EU is helping new member
states, as well as poorer regions in older member states.
The newcomers usually have a lower GDP per capita and
often major problems with their socio-economic
structure. While comprehensive information on the use
and impact of EU structural funds is not easy to obtain,
they do now represent a significant impulse for building
and modernizing the STI infrastructure.

European Union

It is important to know that the budget ceilings for the EU
budget as a whole and for the large subcomponents, the
so-called Financial Perspectives, have been fixed for the
seven-year period to 2013. That is why, in the following
discussion, this period figures frequently. Of course, much
of the money involved in the structural funds is used for
physical infrastructure, utilities or labour market measures
but, in most of the newest member states and some of the
older ones as well, part of funding targets infrastructure for
research and innovation, and the building-up of human
resources. In fact, compared to the first period of structural
fund support to the newest member states from 2004 to
2006, the programmes for 2007–2013 show a marked
increase in support for R&D and innovation. Even though
only a small number of countries have agreed special
operational programmes dedicated to R&D and
innovation,7 in most countries there are now special priority
components within these operational programmes which
are agreed between a country and the European
Commission as implementation vehicles for the policies
governing structural funds. The information presented
below again comes from the ERAWATCH country reports of
2008. It is not always clear whether the amounts mentioned
concern only additional EU funding. A programme for a
particular country involves some national co-funding but,
in the case of R&D and innovation, this usually represents 
a small percentage (10–15%).

In Bulgaria, two of the seven operational programmes are
dedicated to Competitiveness and Development of Human
Resources. The first comprises a grant scheme for improving
the R&D infrastructure of research organizations and for
providing innovation services to companies. Another
provides support to small and medium sized enterprises
wishing to hire researchers to strengthen their innovation
potential. In 2008, some €90 million was spent on these
measures, a considerable sum: it represents three times the
budget of the National Science Fund, for example (see also
page 193). Cyprus intends to use part of the structural funds
for basic infrastructure, such as incubators or a technology
park. In the Czech Republic, the structural funds covering
2007–2013 will be one of the main sources of funding for
R&D infrastructure and for training researchers.

6.  From 1949 to 1991, COMECON served as the Eastern Bloc’s answer to
Europe’s formation of the Organization for European Economic Co-operation.

7.  These are the European Fund for Regional Development and the
European Social Fund, the two components of the structural funds.

UNESCO SCIENCE REPORT 2010

The two dedicated operational programmes, R&D for
Innovation and Education for Competitiveness, will provide
€3.8 billion over 2007–2013. This is a significant addition to
national public expenditure on R&D, which amounted to
just €0.8 billion in 2007. Important as these funds are, they
do have a potentially distortive effect. In the Czech case, the
bulk of the funds will be spent outside the Prague region
where the bulk of R&D capabilities are currently
concentrated. This is because structural funds cannot be
spent at will across a country’s territory; they are linked to a
region’s socio-economic position. There is a risk that
measures to support infrastructure development will be
diluted, especially when it comes to R&D and innovation. As
was argued earlier in the present chapter, Europe should be
careful not to spread its resources for R&D too thinly. That
applies first and foremost to countries. In EU reviews,
countries can earn good marks for vowing to accept the
Lisbon (2000) and Barcelona (2002) goals of the Lisbon
Strategy, which imply devoting 3% of GDP to GERD, if not by
2010 then slightly later. It is a dubious assumption that
Europe will be better off economically with such a
homogeneous distribution of R&D.

If this is true for countries, it also applies to the situation
within countries. Figure 7 shows that large differences
exist in all countries when it comes to their regional
innovation performance. The special Operational
Programme on Competitiveness for Prague will support
science parks, incubators, innovation centres and centres
of excellence, linkages between companies and
universities, or between companies and research centres,
as well as the innovation capacity of enterprises. This
focus on an already dynamic area for R&D may indicate
that countries are aware of the risk. 

In Estonia, one finds a similar heavy reliance on structural
funds for investment in R&D infrastructure. Via two priority
programmes, €365 million will be spent over 2007–2013
on research programmes and modernization of
establishments for higher education and research. 
A further €120 million will go towards developing human
resources for R&D. The same is happening in the other two
Baltic countries. Latvia will spend some € 238 million on
R&D and €202 million on innovation. In Lithuania, 46% of
the funds for economic growth will go to R&D for business

investment in R&D, especially R&D infrastructure. 

learning, as well as co-operation between these
institutions or research centres and industry. 

In Hungary, expenditure on research, technological
development and innovation covers such projects as R&D
centres, innovation and technology parks or complex
technological developments in enterprises. This
expenditure is funded via the Operational Programme on
Economic Development. Similarly, the development of
research infrastructure in institutions of higher learning is
funded via an Operational Programme on Social
Infrastructure. Together, these two programmes constitute
an annual amount of some €200 million. 

Malta, with its small population of about 400 000, will
nevertheless spend €45 million on R&D infrastructure and
human resources training, in addition to funds for
stimulating R&D in industry. 

Poland presents a stark contrast. With a population of about
38 million, it is by far the largest of the 12 member states
that have joined the EU since 2004. The EU structural funds
for Poland are thus incomparably larger. Notwithstanding
this, their relative impact is very considerable indeed. The
ERAWATCH country report of 2008 for Poland mentions that,
in the 2004–2006 period, of the €133 million spent on
strengthening co-operation in Poland between universities
or research institutes and enterprises, a full €100 million was
EU funding. For the 2007–2013 period, in the context of the
Operational Programme for the Innovative Economy, of the
total €9.7 billion, some €1.3 billion supports R&D in modern
technologies and a further €1.3 billion research infrastructure.
Incidentally, this is a case where the EU contribution is
explicitly stated: of the €2.6 billion involved in the two
aforementioned components, €2.23 billion is EU funding. 

Romania is the one country where the use of structural
funds for strengthening the R&D system is so far not
working so well; the country has yet to develop the
capacity to absorb such considerable sums (see page 191). 

Slovenia would not suffer from this handicap. However,
spending structural funds on R&D and innovation is
apparently of lesser priority for Slovenia than for the other
countries discussed here (see also page 190).

Clearly, in many countries, structural funds will be a key
component of their strategies for R&D and innovation for
years to come. Apart from spending these funds wisely
by not falling into the trap of spreading them thinly, for
example, a major challenge will be to build a financially
sustainable STI system by 2013 – for it needs few
predictive powers to foresee that available structural
funds will be thinner on the ground after 2013.

PUBLIC ATTITUDES TO S&T 

European citizens are regularly polled on their attitude to
S&T. These surveys include issues related to scientists
and policy-making. The latest EUROBAROMETER survey
published by the European Commission (2005)8 is based
on 30 000 interviews. Here, we shall give a brief overview
of the illuminating answers to some of the questions. 

Of the respondents, 30% on average said they were very
interested in new inventions and technologies and 48%
moderately interested. The same percentages apply to
scientific discoveries. However, the figures vary greatly
across Europe. In Lithuania, only 14% said they were very
interested in new inventions and technologies, with
similar proportions in Romania (15%), Italy (16%),
Bulgaria (17%) and Portugal (18%). In Cyprus, the figure
was as high as 54%, followed by Malta (46%), the
Netherlands (42%) and Greece (41%). 

There is a marked difference between males (40%) and
females (21%), although the gender difference contracts
when it comes to the level of interest in new scientific
discoveries: 36% versus 25%. When asked which areas of
science were of most interest, 61% of respondents (but
73% of females) cited medicine and 47% the
environment (in equal proportions).

On the question of whether people regularly read articles
on scientific topics in newspapers, magazines or on the
Internet, the smaller countries in north and northwestern

and 25 years. However, the methodology and questions had changed in
this second survey, making it impossible to compare the opinions and
views of the respondents to the 2005 and 2008 surveys.

UNESCO SCIENCE REPORT 2010

Europe emerged with a clear lead: in descending order,
from 38% to 26% of respondents in the Netherlands,
Luxembourg, Belgium, Sweden, Denmark and Finland
answered this question in the affirmative. Switzerland,
Norway and Iceland also scored in the high twenties. The
highest score for the larger countries went to France, with
25%. Italy could manage only 10%, Bulgaria, Romania and
Portugal 11%. The differences shrink if one combines the
answers for regular and occasional reading.

When asked to rank subjects on a scale of 1 (not at all
scientific) to 5 (very scientific), 89% of respondents said
they found medicine to be very scientific and 83% physics.
But 41% were of the opinion that astrology was very
scientific (compared to 40% for astronomy), 33% held the
same view for homeopathy and 40% held economics in a
similar regard. 

Knowledgeability about science was surveyed by asking
10 quiz questions, such as whether the statement that
‘lasers work by focusing sound waves’ was false or
whether it was true that ‘human beings, as we know them
today, developed from earlier species of animals’. On
average, 66% of respondents (70% of men and a 62% of
women) gave correct answers, with extremes of 78% for
Sweden and 48–52% for a group of countries that
includes Bulgaria, Cyprus, Romania, Malta, Lithuania and
Portugal. The question on human evolution was
answered correctly by 70% of respondents throughout
the EU. There is some variation between men and women
but it is insignificant. Perhaps more remarkable is that the
average score for correct answers was still only 78% for
those whose education ended after their twentieth year.

As to which three professional groups or institutions
were most trusted to explain the impact of S&T
developments on society, this question produced some
interesting results (Figure 8). Scientists working for a
university or in a government laboratory were most
trusted by far, followed by television journalists, who
had an edge over their newspaper colleagues.
Somewhat surprisingly, medical doctors scored rather
poorly but this may be because the questionnaire
confined answers to three categories of person or
organization. Again, one finds large variations from one
European country to the next. For example, scientists
working at a university or in a government laboratory
scored 52% on average but between 68% and 76% in
Slovakia, Cyprus, Greece and the Czech Republic.

176

In Portugal, on the other hand, only 38% of
respondents mentioned this category as being among
the three most trusted and in Denmark only 39%.

When it comes to the power respondents ascribe to
science, remarkable differences arise. Asked whether
science would one day give a complete picture of how
nature and the Universe work, 24% of respondents in
Iceland, 27% in Norway and Finland, 31% in the
Netherlands and 37% in Switzerland agreed with the
statement. The figure was even as high as 73% in Malta,
70% in Greece and 59% in Italy. 

As for expectations as to whether S&T progress would
solve social problems, a massive 88% of respondents
agreed that this would help to cure such illnesses as
HIV/AIDS or cancer. The Netherlands, Norway and
Iceland scored highest, 97%, 95% and 94% respectively.
At the other end of the scale came Slovenia and
Lithuania, with a score of 75%. Of course, this heady
level of optimism about what S&T can do does not
extend to all social problems. Only 39% of respondents
in the EU agreed that S&T would help eliminate hunger
and poverty in the world and not more than 21% that

S&T could sort out any problem. There were even deep
lows of 7–9% in the Netherlands, Sweden, France and
Denmark. One might perhaps take the view that
having 21% of respondents believe in the
omnipotence of S&T is a healthy score. Overall, 52% of
respondents were of the view that the benefits of
science outweighed any harmful effects it might have.

Questions were also asked about whether S&T were the
cause of social problems. More than half (57%) of
respondents held S&T responsible for most of today’s
environmental problems and, on a very contentious
issue, 54% of respondents were of the opinion that
genetically modified food was dangerous. Percentages
for this question ranged from 88% and 80% in Cyprus
and Greece respectively to 30% in the Netherlands, 33%
in the UK and 39% in Sweden. Similarly, 59% of
respondents agreed with the statement that, owing to
their knowledge, scientists had a power that made them
dangerous.

The majority of repondents subscribed to the view that
governments ought to support scientific research that
contributes to knowledge: 76% on average for the EU,
the lowest score of 54% going to Austria. The latter
result is surprising, given that Austria is one of only a
handful of the ‘old’ EU countries that has seen its R&D
effort rise considerably in recent years, thanks to a hike
in public funding. 

That the general belief that governments must
support research can be at odds with other
expectations of government is illustrated by the
answers to the question as to whether governments
should spend more money on scientific research and
less in other areas. Here, the Netherlands scored
lowest, with only 25% of respondents agreeing with
this statement. In Malta and Finland, though, only 30%
of those interviewed gave priority to an increase in
government funding of science.

Respondents clearly expected scientists to abide by
ethical standards. As many as 79% felt governments
should formally oblige scientists to respect ethical
standards. This seems to be in line with the view held by
only 36% of respondents that there should be no limit to
what science was allowed to investigate. If, on the other
hand, scientists respected ethical standards, they should
be free to do whatever research they wanted, opined 73%.

European Union

THE EU’S PLACE IN THE WORLD

We are now going to look beyond the EU’s borders to its
competitors. There is no doubt that the EU is one of the
leading regions in the world in STI. However, the total
amount of R&D carried out in the EU-27 measured as a
percentage of GDP remains substantially less than the
comparable amounts in the USA and Japan. Moreover,
China is rapidly catching up to the EU, although the
absolute amount spent on R&D is of course still much
smaller (Table 12). 

A number of non-financial indicators show a more
balanced picture. There are now virtually as many full-
time equivalent (FTE) researchers in the EU-27 as in the
USA, with China not far behind. But perhaps the more
interesting indicator is that for the number of
researchers per 1000 labour force. Here, Japan leads,
followed by the USA, with China still lagging behind
(Table 13).

Not surprisingly, the same scenario repeats itself for the
number of triad patent families. A patent family is a
patent for which protection has been sought in many
countries. A triad patent family means that a patent has
been filed with the European and Japanese Patent
Offices and granted by the US Patents and Trademark
Office. The Triad is almost on a par for this indicator,
which showed little progression between 2003 and 2006
(Figure 9).9 China, on the other hand, has of course
started at a much lower level but is displaying an
extremely rapid growth rate. 

The number of PhD degrees conferred is another
interesting parameter. Here, the EU produces many more
PhDs than the USA and it is Japan that is trailing behind.
To get a better feeling for what these numbers mean, we
need to take the size of the population into account. The
2008 OECD Review of Innovation Policy in China does this
by relating the number of doctoral degrees conferred in
all fields in 2004 to the number of people at the typical
age of graduation. In the 19 EU countries included in the
study, 1.4% of those in this age cohort received a
doctoral degree, compared to 1.3% in the USA, 0.8% in
Japan and 0.1% in China.

9.  This trend will have been calculated for the same number of European
countries for 2003 and 2006.

Turning to the Science Citation Index (SCI), the total
number of publications recorded by Thomson Reuters in
all fields of natural sciences and engineering clearly places
the EU in the lead for this indicator, with 36.5% (39.6% in
2002) of world publications in 2007, ahead of the USA at
27.7% (30.9% in 2002), Japan at 7.6% (10.0%) and China at
10.6% (5.2%) [see page 10]. Put another way, China’s world
share has nearly doubled in just five years, largely to the
detriment of the Triad. 

If the EU also occupies an enviable position in terms of
scientific articles published within international
collaboration, here we must of course take into
consideration that there are 27 countries within the EU,
giving these data only limited comparative value.
The distribution over the various subfields shows that
biology, biomedical sciences and clinical medicine
account for more than 50% of all European publications in
the natural sciences and engineering (Table 14). For the
USA, the equivalent figure is even higher than 60% and for
Japan slightly below 50%. Quite appropriately, it has been
said that the 21st century will be the century of the life
sciences. One is inclined to say that Europe’s higher shares
than the USA (Japan looks more like Europe, with the
exception of mathematics) in physics, chemistry and
mathematics, engineering and technology either reflect a
more traditional, less flexible academic research climate or
a greater emphasis on more traditional industries, or
possibly both. One must be extremely careful, however,
not to draw inferences from generic publication data that
are too general. Not unexpectedly, China differs markedly
from the EU in its publications pattern: biology,
biomedical sciences and clinical medicine account for
some 25% of all publications, whereas the two categories

of chemistry and engineering and technology represent
much higher shares. When differences are this big
between the life sciences and other major fields of
research, this tends to reflect different stages of
development.

We obtain a more comprehensive comparison between
Europe, the USA and Japan if we widen the scope beyond
input, throughput and output in R&D to indicators that try
to measure the outcome in terms of innovation and also
take into account factors conducive to innovation. An
example of the former would be the relative amount of
products new to the market, or at least new to the country
or region concerned. The amount of venture capital
available relative to the size of the economy would be an
example of a stimulating condition. In the wake of efforts
to capture the innovative performance of individual EU

countries and even regions, the European Commission
has begun comparing Europe with the USA and Japan
(Figure 10). A set of 17 indicators is used in three broad
categories: Enablers, Firm Activities and Outputs.  The
methodology is similar to that for the Summary
Innovation Index (see page 167). 

The EU Innovation Scoreboard of 2008 concludes that, for
these 17 indicators, the USA and Japan still perform
considerably better when it comes to innovation.
Nevertheless, the EU-27 has been inching closer to the
USA since 2004 and, to a lesser extent, to Japan. It is a little
soon to rejoice, however, as the gap is not closing for
three key indicators: business R&D, patents filed with the
European Patent Office and those filed under the Patent
Cooperation Treaty. For these three indicators, Japan is
even increasing its lead over the EU.

CONCLUSION

We can see from the foregoing that the EU is now clearly the
world leader as far as SCI publications are concerned. But
what counts in terms of input is expenditure on R&D and, in
terms of output, innovation performance. A lot of work lies
ahead for Europe, as witnessed by the EU effectively having
abandoned the Lisbon and Barcelona targets. The EU is of
course not a homogeneous whole. The Summary
Innovation Index, which offers a one-figure comparison of
countries, shows that there are, in fact, three groups of
countries: the leaders, the followers and the stragglers. 

Interestingly, the statistics reveal that performing well in
innovation is not a privilege reserved for the ‘old’ member
states. More generally, the 12 new member states which
acceded to the EU in 2004 and 2007 are for the most part
making a valiant effort to renew and modernize their research
and innovation systems. A danger is, though, that each of
these countries will be inclined to apply the Barcelona target
of devoting a 3% share of GDP to GERD to their own domestic
situation, even though the example of the USA illustrates that
broad regional differences are the norm.

European scientists, funding agencies and governments –
not to mention companies – have long since realized that,
when it comes to research and innovation, capabilities
sometimes need to be pooled. This realization has led, for
example, to large European multilateral research
organizations like CERN which involve collaboration
among several individual countries. It has also led to the
EU’s Framework Programmes. But a slew of other
organizations and initiatives have also been established:

the European Science Foundation and EUREKA are just
two examples. Setting up the European Research Council
(ERC) as a veritable continental funding agency has been
the most important step taken in Europe for a long time.
It is one reason why this council has triggered a much
more fundamental debate than we usually see in Europe.
What should be done at the European level? What is the
role of the European Commission (or the EU), the
national governments, the national funding agencies
and the ERC? This is a discussion which has far-reaching
implications. 

Shouldn’t the EU’s Framework Programme focus much
more on a limited number of genuine European
challenges, such as developing a much stronger ERC,
investing in key research infrastructure and funding a
limited number of major European missions in the fields
of energy, environment, health and so on? Or should the
EU ignore these options and continue to fund a large
number of relatively small projects that place centre stage
the idea of collaboration between often large research
groups spread across Europe? What future lies ahead for
the EU’s ambition of co-ordinating all national research,
an ambition that has in practice always been thwarted? 

The institutional reforms of universities, research
institutes and organizations in Europe are part and parcel
of this agenda for change. However, providing a more
effective funding system in future is one thing; ensuring
that the institutions carrying out research are positioned
and resourced in the best way possible is quite another.
What is certain is that these twin challenges will need to
be tackled simultaneously.

Slavo Radosevic

INTRODUCTION

Southeast Europe encompasses the relatively developed
science systems of Greece and Slovenia, the ‘semi-
developed’ systems of Bulgaria, Croatia, Romania and
Serbia, along with science systems in real need of
development – those of Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina,
Kosovo, Montenegro and the Former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia. The Republic of Moldova shares many
features with this last group of countries, although it
follows a specific post-Soviet system.

Contemporary Southeast Europe is the most diverse
region in Europe in terms of socio-economic development,
institutional frameworks and the level of science and
technology (S&T) capacity. 

There is a ten-fold difference in per-capita income
between the richest (Greece and Slovenia) and poorest
(Moldova) countries in this region (Table 1). This is both a
historical legacy and the result of the civil wars that
accompanied the gradual break-up of Yugoslavia in the
early 1990s. In fact, the disintegration of Yugoslavia was
only complete in 2008, after popular referenda in
Montenegro (May 2006) and Kosovo (February 2008)
opted for independence from Serbia.

Four countries from Southeast Europe have so far acceded
to the European Union (EU): Greece in 1981, Slovenia in
2004 and Bulgaria and Romania in 2007. These countries
are covered in the present chapter but also appear in that
on the EU (see page 147). The remainder either have
candidate status for the EU (Croatia, Former Yugoslav
Republic of Macedonia and Turkey) or uncertain prospects
regarding membership (Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina,
Kosovo, Moldova, Montenegro and Serbia).

For those countries still on the outside looking in, European
integration represents the only viable project for ensuring
social and political coherence. For those countries that are
already EU members, prosperous neighbours are the best
guarantee of political stability and economic growth.

At the end of the first decade of the 21st century, Albania,
Bulgaria, Croatia Romania and Slovenia have all fully
recovered from the crisis of transition from the Soviet system
to a market economy. In the remaining countries, however,
income levels still compare unfavourably with income per
capita during the socialist period. Nonetheless, since 2000,
the economies of all of the Southeast European countries
have been growing at average rates of around 3% or higher.
With the onset of the global recession in 2008, growth rates
in the region are likely to slow down considerably.

The key challenge for the majority of these countries is to
ensure further sustainable economic growth. These are
open economies; however, the majority of them are still
burdened with high unemployment, weakness in the rule
of law and an undeveloped financial system.

CONDITIONS FOR R&D

Disparities in the pace of restructuring
The socio-economic features of Southeast European
economies strongly influence the role of science in the
region and prospects for national economic growth based
on domestic knowledge. Their research and development
(R&D) systems face acute challenges, in particular
regarding science-oriented innovation.

The pace of restructuring varies enormously. Albania, Bosnia
and Herzogovina – and the Former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia to some extent – are the most disadvantaged.
They are still striving to establish functioning R&D systems
and are thus primarily addressing science policy issues. 
At the other end of the scale, Bulgaria, Croatia and Romania
are implementing very much EU-driven and EU-inspired
changes. Together with Turkey, these three countries are
making a visible attempt to shift the focus from conventional
science policy towards innovation policy. Individual national
plans, such as the 2005 Turkish National Science and
Technology Strategy, have created new momentum which, 
if it continues, could provide examples of good practice for
other countries in the region (see page 202).

In the 1990s, all but Greece grappled with the challenges
of an economic transition to post-socialism following the
disintegration of Yugoslavia. This led to a deterioration of
their science systems, which in some cases has been
extremely severe, as described in the UNESCO Science
Report 2005.

In Southeast Europe, external conditions for innovation,
such as institutions, market efficiency and business
sophistication, have shown improvement since the early
1990s, as a result of institutional changes in these
transitional economies. However, these changes have not
necessarily been accompanied by a greater capability

among firms to absorb new technology and innovate
(Radosevic, 2007). Both the new EU member states and
the ex-socialist countries have come to realize that
policies have not succeeded so far in promoting growth in
the absence of strategies that directly address S&T and
training, although there are of course also major intra-
regional differences in terms of technological readiness.

Science, technology and innovation (STI) play very
different roles in economic growth in the sub-region. The
Global Competitiveness Report (WEF, 2010) categorizes
countries according to their stage of transition towards a
globally competitive economy, taking into account drivers
of growth that range from the availability of labour or raw
materials to measures of efficiency and innovation 
(Figure 1). The report considers eight of the Southeast
European countries to be at the ‘efficiency-driven’ stage
and Slovenia and Greece to be at the ‘innovation-driven’
stage. Nestled in-between is Croatia, in transition from
efficiency- to innovation-driven. Albania and Bosnia and
Herzegovina were upgraded to efficiency-driven
economies in 2008, whereas Moldova has remained 
at the factor-driven stage.

Weak demand for R&D
The R&D systems of countries in Southeast Europe cover a
wide spectrum in terms of their relative size, performance
and role in society and the economy. However, all but
Slovenia share a common feature: domestic demand for
R&D and for skilled employees is relatively weak,
especially compared to the supply of R&D (Radosevic,
2007). There are several reasons for this. One is no doubt
the structure of industry, which is dominated by small
firms working in traditional industries that do not exploit
new technologies. Lack of capacity is another factor.
Serbia easily has the biggest demand–supply gap, both
because of unsophisticated industries and the inability 
of local demand to make up for limited international 
co-operation. Poor demand for R&D is also the greatest
weakness of the new EU Member States.

Throughout the region, R&D systems have stabilized in
recent years and are gradually recovering from the recession
caused by the transition to a market economy. In the new
EU member states, the pace of change is much faster, as
these countries are enjoying significant increases in funding
of their R&D through EU structural funds (see page 173).

R&D INPUT

R&D expenditure
Throughout the region, the decline or, at best, stabilization
of employment in R&D has been accompanied by either
stagnation or a drop in the share of GDP invested in R&D.
Only Slovenia and Romania have managed to inverse 
the trend. Serbia, meanwhile, is trying to make up lost
ground (Figure 2).

Southeast Europe

Differences in gross domestic expenditure on R&D (GERD)
are much greater when population size is taken into
account (Figure 3). For example, Slovenian investment per
capita in R&D is 2.5 times that of Greece and 21 times that
of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.

Sectoral structures of R&D funding and performance differ
significantly from employment structures, largely due to
the lower capital intensity of R&D in higher education
when compared to the business sector (Figures 4 and 5).
This explains the relatively higher share of GERD spent in
the business enterprise sector, the much lower share of
the higher education sector and the relatively similar
position of the government sector.

The main source of R&D funding in the sub-region is the
government (Bulgaria, Croatia, Romania and Serbia) or a
combination of government and foreign sources (Greece).
Only in Slovenia is the business enterprise sector the
dominant funder and performer of R&D, which is to be
expected, given the relatively strong role of innovation
and knowledge in Slovene growth. On the whole, the
business sector enjoys limited support from government
in most countries, as evidenced by the relative similarity of
its shares in R&D funding and in performance. Only in
Romania is the business sector heavily financed by
government, where business accounts for 48.5% of R&D
performed but only 30.4% of R&D funding. The higher
education sectors in all Southeast European countries are
also largely government-funded. With EU accession, the
shares of foreign funding (primarily from the EU) are likely
to increase in both Romania and Bulgaria.

The above structural features indicate a relatively slow
transformation of R&D towards enterprise-based R&D
systems. Yet, during the transition period and until
recently, the trend was towards a stronger higher
education sector. With continuing recovery and economic
growth, we can expect the business enterprise sector to
take on added importance.

Severe brain drain
As a consequence of poor demand for R&D, Albania,
Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Moldova, Montenegro,
Romania, Serbia and the Former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia all suffer from severe brain drain. An
assessment of the severity of this affliction ranks these
countries at between 109th and 121st out of the 
125 countries studied (WEF, 2007).

Growing demand for education
In parallel, there is a growing demand for education,
which is perceived as being the best way to avoid
unemployment or increase one’s chances of emigrating.
Strong economic growth since 2000 has created more
employment opportunities for the highly skilled. This has
swollen the number of tertiary graduates at bachelor level
in all but Bulgaria. One of the positive legacies of socialism
is the high quality of mathematics and science teaching in
schools, as evidenced by assessments in Croatia, Romania,
Serbia and Montenegro (WEF, 2008).

In Romania, Serbia and the Former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia, there has been a huge expansion in the
number of undergraduates. Their number increased by
between 95% and 287% over 2002–2008. There has also
been a stark increase in the number of master’s degrees
and PhDs awarded in the region (Figure 6).

Declining or stagnant numbers of researchers in Croatia,
Moldova, Romania and the Former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia suggest a shrinking demand for R&D. Despite
economic growth, the R&D systems of these countries
have actually downsized, while others have remained
stable or progressed (Figure 7).

Systemic change in R&D
A decreasing demand for R&D accompanied by a growing
number of tertiary graduates suggests that Southeast
European economies are facing significant structural changes
in terms of the demand for knowledge. Once very focused on
R&D, demand for knowledge is becoming non-R&D-based.

In addition, formerly extramural-based R&D systems are
experiencing difficulties in adjusting to an enterprise-based
R&D system. As in other countries at a similar level of
development, R&D systems in the sub-region are either
dominated by the government sector or by the higher
education sector (Figure 8).

Slovenia is the only country where private industry is the
biggest employer. In Slovenia, this reflects the country’s

high level of development and the increasing role of
knowledge in ensuring the competitiveness of industry.
It is also the case in Romania but this was much more a
reflection of the unrestructured network of former
industrial institutes that still operate under state
ownership to the detriment of the development of in-
house R&D.

Countries in Southeast Europe do, however, have some
trends in common. Between 2001 and 2006, there was a
relative rise in employment in the higher education sector
in all but Slovenia and a drop in employment in the
government sector in all but Romania.

The shift towards higher education is symptomatic both
of the neglect of university R&D in the past and of better
financial opportunities for universities, enabling them to
combine R&D and teaching.

Growth in employment in the private sector has been
observed in all but Croatia, Serbia and Romania but
remains modest in all but Greece and Slovenia.

R&D OUTPUT
Publications and patents
The current performance of R&D in Southeast Europe 
is strongly linked to investment per capita and to the
overall level of development. Trade in licenses is a useful
indicator for measuring performance, in that it not only
shows the degree to which countries are involved in
exchanging knowledge but also relates to both the size
of R&D systems and to the technological level of industry.

Slovenia, Croatia and Greece are far more involved in this
type of exchange than their neighbours (Table 2). These
three countries are also the biggest contributors in the
region to world S&T in terms of three important
indicators: the number of papers published per capita, 
the number of US patents obtained per capita and the
amount received per capita in royalty payments and
receipts. In this context, university–industry linkages are
the most developed in Slovenia and Croatia. That this is
not the case in Greece is largely due to the low
technological level of Greece’s industry.

Published scientific papers are not only a key output of a
country’s science system; they also indicate the degree to
which the country is integrated in the international
scientific community. In this respect, Greece stands out in
the region in terms of the overall number of published
scientific articles, with three to four times as many as any
other country in the sub-region (Table 3). That said, the
most developed science system in the sub-region is that
of Slovenia, as evidenced by the number of scientific
papers published per capita (Figure 9). Bulgaria, Croatia,
Romania and Serbia are all intermediate countries. 
As for Albania, Moldova, Montenegro and the Former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, they all have relatively
undeveloped science systems.

Science in Southeast Europe is dominated by four broad
disciplines: physics, engineering/technology, chemistry
and clinical medicine (Figure 10). In all but Albania, these
four areas account for from 56% (Croatia) to 89%
(Moldova) of all scientific publications. There was no
significant evolution in the relative specialization of
published scientific texts between 2002 and 2008,
according to Science Citation Index data.

COUNTRY PROFILES

As we have seen above, the combination of weak demand
for local R&D and innovation, on the one hand, and poor
support systems for science and innovation, on the other,
are the biggest bottlenecks to more effectively harnessing
S&T to socio-economic growth in Southeast Europe.

Constraints on the demand side are further reinforced by
constraints on supply, embodied by persistently strong
external and internal brain drain coupled with an ageing
pool of researchers. This portrait applies mainly to those
countries in the Western Balkans1 and to Moldova – the
very same countries that are yet to become EU members
and which face uncertain prospects for future EU
membership.

Whereas the EU members from Southeast Europe share
their neighbours’ weakness on the demand side, they are
generally in a much better position when it comes to their
support systems for science and innovation (Slovenia and
Greece) and the opportunities at their door for greater R&D
funding and better S&T governance (Romania and Bulgaria).

A review of changes in individual countries reveals
yawning differences in the degree of development and
pace of restructuring of R&D systems, not to mention S&T
governance (Nechifor and Radosevic, 2007). The R&D
systems of Albania, Montenegro and Bosnia and
Herzegovina – and to some extent the Former Yugoslav
Republic of Macedonia – are the most disadvantaged.
These countries are still striving to establish functioning
R&D systems and are primarily addressing issues of
science policy. Moldova is a specific case of a post-Soviet
R&D system that has not reformed substantially. 
Bulgaria, Croatia and Romania have R&D systems at similar
levels of development. In these three countries, there is a
visible attempt to shift the focus from a narrow science
policy to an innovation policy, or to integrate science into
innovation policy.

As new EU members, Romania and Bulgaria have begun
instigating vigorous changes that include introducing
new sources of funding and internationalizing R&D. 
This should result in a substantial reform of their R&D
systems in the medium term.

In view of its R&D capacities, Serbia should also be in this
group. However, owing to its international isolation in the
1990s, accompanied by a dire economic situation, Serbia
is trailing behind in terms of change, especially when it
comes to gearing its science system towards innovation.

Although the structure of industry differs greatly in
Slovenia and Greece, both of these countries have well-
established frameworks for science and innovation
governance. We shall begin with them in the following
country analyses before moving on to the two other 
EU member states then the countries of the former
Yugoslavia, before concluding with Albania and Moldova.

Slovenia
The Slovenian R&D system managed to elude a post-
socialist crisis in the 1990s. Since joining the EU, Slovenia’s
research system has been developing well. Business sector
investment in R&D is growing, even as public expenditure
remains stable as a percentage of GDP. In terms of
scientific output, indicators such as publishing and
citation rates for scientific articles and the impact factor all
show a strong progression, while the overall system
continues to internationalize. In parallel, the inclusion of
various measures supporting R&D and innovation in the
EU’s structural assistance programmes within the EU’s

190

Seventh Framework Programme for Research and
Technological Development (FP7, 2007–2013) is providing
the necessary stability for public investment in R&D (see
page 172).

The government has used EU funds to implement two
operational programmes. The first is Slovenia’s
Operational Programme for Strengthening Regional
Development Potential. This focuses on improving the
competitiveness of the country’s enterprises and its
research excellence, and promoting entrepreneurship and
infrastructure for economic development, with a total
investment of €558.71 million. The second is the
Operational Programme for the Development of Human
Resources. This programme benefits from a fund of 
€39.54 million to foster entrepreneurship among experts
and researchers and to promote their adaptability to the
world of corporate competitiveness. These two
operational programmes complement the Programme of
Measures and provide the basis for effective
implementation of a national policy to encourage
entrepreneurship and competitiveness, as well as the
efficient use of resources from structural funds.

Although business R&D is developing relatively well,
linkages with the public sector remain weak. In 2006, for
example, only 10.1% of public R&D funds went to the
business sector, a decline of approximately 20% since the
turn of the century. This trend suggests that demand for
business knowledge is best met by the business sector’s
own R&D capacities and that public research should keep
to its own areas of interest (ERAWATCH, 2008).

Measures designed to stimulate private investment in
R&D include a corporate income tax subsidy, various
means of co-financing R&D projects, subsidized loans for
R&D investment, co-financing of the services that
technology parks offer the business sector, development
of business incubators and mobility schemes, and support
for technology centres and platforms. One policy measure
to improve the quality of research is the establishment of
centres of excellence. The government has supported the
establishment of 10 such centres, providing a new form of
co-operation between business and public research.

Greece
The Greek science system operates in an economic
environment with limited demand for R&D, due to an
industrial structure dominated by traditional business

activities and small and medium-sized enterprises. 
Even though Greece has developed an R&D-oriented
innovation policy, the non-R&D-intensive structure of its
industry is limiting the policy’s impact on the economy
and employment (PRO-Inno Trendchart, 2007).

Business R&D is not only stagnant but also negligible,
despite persistent efforts to reorient firms towards R&D and
other knowledge-intensive activities. Most of these efforts
have been undertaken within the EU’s structural assistance
programme for competitiveness and entrepreneurship, and
the five regional programmes covering the 13 regions of
Greece. Thematic priorities include information and
communication technologies (ICTs), agriculture, fisheries,
food science and biotechnology.

Greece has set itself a target of devoting 1.5% of GDP to
GERD by 2015. This is ambitious, given that Greece’s
GERD/GDP ratio has been a steady 0.6% since the turn of
the century. The EU contribution to this effort amounts to
€1 291 million. Nearly half of these EU funds (46.5%) are
channelled into areas related to innovation: innovative
investments; R&D activities and infrastructure; the provision
of advanced services to firms and entrepreneurship; and
strengthening linkages between R&D units and small and
medium-sized enterprises. However, faced with limited

local demand, R&D-intensive firms have reoriented
themselves towards EU funding or foreign markets.

In parallel, the education system in Greece remains
unreformed and slow to meet new demands, despite
having expanded considerably. This is because any form of
evaluation of the education system or accountability was
rejected for many years. Without feedback from the labour
market, teaching methods and curricula have remained
based on centrally selected manuals. There is an ongoing
debate about possible reforms, mainly in universities. A
reform law re-regulating administrative issues has begun a
very slow and controversial process of implementation.

Romania
The Romanian R&D system has emerged from its own
‘transition crisis’ and is now recovering, especially since
Romania gained EU membership in 2007 (see page 172).
There has been some growth in public R&D expenditure,
up from 0.37% in 2000 to 0.46% in 2006, as part of the
government’s commitment to meeting the 3% target of
the Lisbon Strategy (Box 1).

The need to converge towards EU norms and practices
has strongly influenced science and innovation policy in
Romania. The decision-making system has been

decentralized, funding systems have diversified and
become more flexible, there has been a gradual increase
in domestic competition-based funding, and the country’s
first National R&D and Innovation Plan has rewarded and
assisted outstanding R&D groups.

Romania’s second National R&D and Innovation Plan
(2007–2013) contains strong provisions for investment in
research, highly consistent with the priorities of the EU
Seventh Framework Programme. The priorities of the Plan
reflect the results of the first Romanian foresight exercise
in S&T. As part of this exercise, a broad Delphi survey was
employed in which over 3500 experts identified in the first
phase of the project were consulted in two rounds. As a
result of the survey, nine priority domains were identified

as having substantial potential for socio-economic
progress and the second plan was built around them.
These nine priority domains are: ICTs, energy,
environment, agriculture, food safety and security,
biotechnologies, innovative materials, processes and
products, space and security, and socio-economic and
humanistic systems. Each of the nine domains comprises
several priority themes.

Within the framework of the second plan, competitive
bidding for five of the six programmes was organized in
2007 and 2008. A better utilization of resources is expected
in the years to come, through support for research
programmes directed more towards satisfying demand
from the public and private sectors. Stricter norms have

also been introduced in the second plan for evaluation and
quality control during a project’s life-cycle.

On the downside, international co-operation in R&D
remains very weak in Romania, a situation exacerbated by
the paltry demand for R&D from the business sector.
Infrastructure for science-oriented innovation also remains
underdeveloped but it is expected that, through EU-
support programmes, this situation will turn around. The
benefit of improvements to the public R&D system may be
limited unless business R&D expands and takes on new
orientations. Accession to the EU has certainly had a
positive impact on the mobility of students. In the long
term, this should provide Romania with more highly skilled
employees and improve the absorptive capacity of firms.

Bulgaria
The Bulgarian research system bears similarities to that of
Romania. For one thing, it is emerging from a prolonged
period of downsizing, restructuring and meagre
investment in R&D. The country’s EU accession has
promoted a large spectrum of institutional changes 
in the governance of science and innovation.

The National Innovation Fund within the Ministry of
Economy and Energy has become the primary public
financial instrument for implementation of Bulgaria’s
National Innovation Strategy. The Ministry has also
approved the creation of several Centres of
Entrepreneurship within Bulgarian Technical Universities.

Box 1: The Lisbon Strategy’s elusive 3% target

When the European Council met in
Lisbon in March 2000, the Heads of
State and Government assigned to the
EU the objective of becoming, by 2010,
‘the most competitive and dynamic
knowledge-based economy in the
world, capable of sustainable
economic growth with more and
better jobs and greater social cohesion’
(Lisbon European Council, 2000). Two
years later in Barcelona, they fixed a

target for each country of devoting 3%
of GDP to R&D by 2010. It was
proposed that two-thirds of this share
(2% of GDP) come from the private
sector. Non-EU members are not
bound by these ambitious goals.

Of the four EU members from

Southeast Europe, only Slovenia
stands a chance of achieving the
Lisbon goals, particularly that for
private-sector investment in R&D.

However, many ‘older’ EU

members are also struggling to attain
the elusive Eldorado. In 2008, just two
European countries exceeded the 3%
target – Sweden and Finland – and
the average for the 27-member
European Union was 1.8%. 

Source: author

For details of the situation in the EU, 
see page 166.

Bulgaria is the implementation of the European PHARE
project focusing on the cluster approach and establishing
the cluster model.

Each individual ministry has a plan to shape and
implement sectoral research policies but there is no
national co-ordination body. As a result, synchronizing
sectoral policies and achieving synergy is proving
problematic. Another weakness of the innovation system
is the lack of well-developed public–private partnerships.

The government has recently introduced incentives for
private financing of R&D through the establishment of the
National Innovation Fund (NIF) and National Science Fund
(NSF). These funds introduce competitive bidding for up
to 50% of R&D project funding.

In parallel, the state has committed to increasing public
spending on research and innovation: the annual NSF budget
for 2008 nearly quadrupled to roughly €32 million over the
previous year. Although the share of the competitive funding
provided by the NSF and NIF remains low, it still allows funds
to be allocated to the best proposals. Other strong points are
that the NSF projects are evaluated by international experts
and that, since 2007, 30% of grants can be used for additional
remuneration of any young researchers who have
participated in the preparation of a project proposal.

Long-term research funding is highly dependent on
European funding, notably via the EU structural funds (see
page 173). EU membership is also providing Romanian
researchers with greater access to knowledge. However,
links are still missing between innovative Romanian
enterprises and the bulk of the R&D system (Ruslanov,
2007). The country’s support system for science-oriented
innovation remains undeveloped.

Croatia
The Croatian R&D system is strongly oriented towards
research in the public sector. This helped to preserve and
maintain the national science base during the 1990s but
also led to neglect of the private sector. As a result, the
private sector’s technological capacities are weak,
generating a limited demand for local R&D. Support for
science-oriented innovation is currently being developed
through five technology centres and the Croatian Institute
of Technology (Svarc and Becic, 2007). This dynamic will
most likely be pursued, with expected accession to the EU
in the next few years.

However, the scope of innovation policy is confined to
infrastructural support for the commercialization of
private R&D results. There is a need to broaden this
framework and to foster co-operation between public
science and private industry.

It should be noted, however, that these two funds would
need to be substantially bigger to have an impact on R&D
and innovation. The government would be wise to
reallocate part of the current institutional funding to these
competitive funds.

Serbia
Serbia made only cosmetic changes to its R&D system
during the 1990s. The country’s R&D system has
transformed itself gradually by diversifying sources of
income and activities, by closing R&D institutions and by

194

reducing reliance on domestic R&D activities. This ‘silent
transition’ (Kutlaca, 2007) has been accompanied by
brain drain and an absence of middle-aged researchers.

Since 2003, Serbia has begun establishing a support
system for science-oriented innovation through
technology incubators, innovation centres and science
and technology parks. The downsized business sector
remains in crisis, however, pending changes in ownership
and larger inflows of foreign direct investment. The
opportunity for Serbia to participate in EU Framework
Programmes for R&D will most likely prove beneficial for
the country’s R&D system.

Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia
The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has begun
modernizing its science system and is in the process of
preparing a national science policy. In 2005, it initiated
this reform by introducing a new system of project
evaluation. A year later, the government approved the
national Programme for the Development of Scientific
Research Activities for the period 2006–2010, the first
official programme adopted by the government relating
to developing the country’s R&D capacities.

Bosnia and Herzegovina
More than a decade after the inter-ethnic war following
the break-up of Yugoslavia, Bosnia and Herzegovina has
not yet established its own R&D system. Current
investment in R&D is estimated to be between 0.05% and
0.15% of GDP (Matic, 2007; Papon and Pejovnik, 2007).
The division of political and administrative responsibilities
among the three levels of government2 makes it very
difficult to define and implement country-level science
policy. 

For many years, the country remained isolated in terms of
access to EU R&D funding and other co-operation
agreements. This was partly due to its inability to operate
as a single entity in international relations. This changed
on 1 January 2009 when Bosnia and Herzegovina became
an ‘associated country’ with respect to the EU Seventh
Framework Programe. This new status will, at last, enable
the country to access the international R&D community; 
it is also an important incentive to overcome internal
fragmentation.

Montenegro
Four years after gaining independence from Serbia in May
2006, Montenegro is in the process of establishing its own
science system and science policy. The country’s S&T system
consists of the Montenegrin Academy of Sciences and Arts
(founded in 1973) and the University of Montenegro
(founded in 1974). The university comprises 14 faculties and
one college, with 1 000 students, and incoroprates four
scientific research institutes.

Albania
Public investment in R&D is less than 0.18% of GDP in
Albania and there is little business R&D to speak of
(Sulstarova, 2007). Brain drain strongly undermines the
rejuvenation of the country’s R&D system.

Albania initiated a reform in 2005 by creating a single system
of scientific research, concentrated in universities. In 2007, 
14 of the institutes attached to the Academy of Sciences
were subsumed into universities.

Since 2008, the Albanian government has initiated a range of
policy measures. In June 2009, it published a Cross-cutting
Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation in Albania. 
This identifies five ‘strategic goals’ for the country to 2015:

I to triple public spending on research to 0.6% of GDP;

I to increase the share of GERD from foreign sources to 40%
of the total, including via the EU’s Framework Programmes
for Research and Technological Development;

I to create four or five Albanian centres of excellence 

in science;

I to double the number of researchers through ‘brain

gain’ incentives like a Young and Returning Researchers
grant scheme and the training of new researchers,
including 500 PhDs: three new doctoral programmes 
are to be established in Albanian universities;

I to increase innovation in 100 companies through

investment in local R&D, or via consortia with either
academic research institutes or foreign partners.

The Cross-cutting Strategy is to be implemented in synergy
with the National Strategy for Development and Integration
(2007–2013) and other sectoral strategies, including
Albania’s Higher Education Strategy (2008).

Box 2: The Venice Process

Since 2001, the Venice Process 
has been rebuilding scientific 
co-operation among Southeast
European countries. The goal is to
encourage countries to share limited
resources and to heal the scars of a
decade of political and socio-
economic turmoil. In parallel, the
process sets out to build scientific 
co-operation between the sub-
region and the rest of Europe, in order
to prepare countries for integration
into the European Research Area.

The process was officially launched
at the Venice Conference of Experts on
Rebuilding Scientific Co-operation in
Southeastern Europe, on 24–27 March
2001. Seven months later, the
recommendations adopted by the
conference met with the unanimous
approval of the ministers responsible
for science and technology from the
countries concerned, at a roundtable
organized during UNESCO’s General
Conference. Also attending the
roundtable were numerous countries
from the EU and several non-
governmental organizations.

The Venice Process is named after

the host city of UNESCO’s Regional
Bureau for Science and Culture in
Europe (BRESCE). Since 2002,
UNESCO’s Venice office has provided
science policy advice and expertise to
Southeast European countries, in
order to raise awareness of the
importance of investing in S&T for
national and regional development.
In addition to gathering ministers and
other high-level decision-makers
together on issues related to STI
governance, BRESCE has contributed
to the elaboration of national STI
strategies in Bosnia and Herzegovina
and in Albania. 

Moreover, the Venice office has

provided financial support and
organized programmes to encourage
regional networking in life sciences,
environmental sciences and
astronomy as a means of tackling
brain drain, supporting communi -
cation services and strengthening
scientific co-operation as a tool for
reconciliation and dialogue.

Four new Southeast European
networks
In 2003, Prof. Alexander Boksenberg
of Cambridge University (UK)
undertook an expert mission to the
main centres of astronomy in the
region on behalf of UNESCO. This
resulted in a programme entitled
Enhancing Astronomical Research
and Observation in Southeast Europe
and Ukraine, with financial support
from the Italian government. Within
this programme, the most important
telescope in Southeast Europe was
upgraded with financial support from
BRESCE. Today, the Astronomical
Observatory of Rozhen in Bulgaria
which hosts the telescope has
become a major research facility
shared by researchers throughout the
sub-region.

A Southeast European

Astronomical Research Network has
also been created with statutes
drafted by its members. The network
has since established a co-ordination
mechanism for astronomical research,
the Sub-regional European
Astronomical Committee, which has 
a rotating presidency and secretariat.
A large number of astronomical
events in the region have been
organized within this framework,
some of which have benefited from

financial support from UNESCO’s
Venice office.

Galvanized by this success story,

the Venice office has gone on to
support the creation of a Human
Genetics and Biotechnology Network,
which met for the first time in March
2006 at the Research Centre for
Genetic Engineering and
Biotechnology in Skopje (Bulgaria).

The Venice office also spear-

headed the establishment, in 2007, 
of a sub-regional network for Risk
Assessment and Mitigation, 
co-ordinated by the Institute of
Geodynamics in Athens and a sub-
regional Mathematical and Theoretical
Physics Network, hosted by the
Faculty of Science and Mathematics at
the University of Niš in Serbia.

The GRID computing project
UNESCO’s GRID project is sponsored
by the Hewlett Packard company.
Since 2004, it has helped to combat
brain drain and facilitate networking
by donating GRID computing
technology to seven universities in
Southeast Europe. This has enabled
students to collaborate on research
projects with their peers worldwide
without having to leave their home
institution. Seed money provided by
the project has also given students
the opportunity to participate in
short exchanges with universities
abroad.

Southeast Europe

Also in 2009, Albania launched its first survey of R&D
statistics, including business R&D and innovation, with the
support of UNESCO.

Moldova
Moldova is the only post-Soviet country in Southeast
Europe. Its R&D system continues to be organized around
the Academy of Sciences. Investment in R&D has
continued its downward spiral, dropping to 0.4% in 2004
from 0.6% in 2000. Between 2000 and 2004, employment
of research scientists and engineers declined by 5%. Mass
emigration accompanied by brain drain is hindering
domestic innovation and entrepreneurship.

INTERNATIONAL CO-OPERATION

The violent break-up of Yugoslavia in the 1990s threw
most of the Western Balkan countries into isolation for the
greater part of the decade, including in terms of
international scientific co-operation. The first decade of
the 21st century marks a new era, one in which science
systems of Western Balkan countries are being rebuilt and
reconnecting to the R&D networks of the EU. The process
is still painfully slow. It is being hindered not only by
external factors like EU policies but, to an even greater
extent, by the lack of a national consensus on the need to
base economic growth on science-oriented innovation.

Since 2000, UNESCO has been leading initiatives to
improve co-operation in the region, within what has come
to be known as the Venice Process (Box 2). This pro cess
has since been followed by various EU initiatives such as
the Southeast European ERA-NET, a horizontal network
that aims to structure and expand the European Research
Area to the Western Balkan countries. Strengthening the
relationship between the EU and the Western Balkan
countries, including Moldova, is the most effective way to
overcome their isolation and give them greater access to
international R&D networks.

In addition, international co-operation may further
improve with the integration since 2007 of the Western
Balkan countries into the EU Seventh Framework
Programme for Research and Technological Development
(FP7). The FP7 is now the single biggest source of foreign
R&D funding for Western Balkan countries and represents
a major opportunity for them to introduce the notion of
excellence into evaluation criteria.

Beyond Europe, the major partner for individual countries in
Southeast Europe is the USA, through bilateral co-operation.
There is of course also considerable scope for intra-regional
bilateral co-operation, one of the goals of the Venice Process.
This bilateral co-operation within Southeast Europe should
include not only bilateral projects but also fellowships,
information services and joint refereeing systems.

Box 3: Measuring implementation of the Science Agenda

Where does Southeast Europe stand
in relation to the Science Agenda, the
document adopted by governments
on 1 July 1999 at the World
Conference on Science organized by
UNESCO and the International
Council for Science?

One of the Science Agenda’s

90 recommendations was for
countries to devote a greater share of
GDP to R&D. In most of Southeast
Europe, there is the political will to do
just this. In the four EU member states
from the region, a range of measures
have been taken which point in the
right direction. Among the three
most recent EU members – Bulgaria,

Romania and Slovenia – there is also a
trend towards a diversification of
funding sources for R&D.

Most countries from the region

are increasing support for
university–industry partnerships as a
way of enhan cing science-oriented
innovation, another recommendation
of the Science Agenda. However, the
experiences of those countries that
are ahead in this area, including
Greece, indicate that this is a slow
process hampered by a lack of
domestic demand.

Another recommendation
advocates a greater mobility of
professionals between universities

and industry, and between countries,
as well as through research networks
and inter-firm partnerships. 
In Southeast Europe, the level of
support for professional mobility
varies widely.

The biggest weakness in the

region remains an insufficient focus
on institutions of higher learning in
the fields of engineering,
technological and vocational
education, not to mention lifelong
learning.

CONCLUSION

BIBLIOGRAPHY

The diversity of Southeast Europe is both a massive
obstacle (such as in terms of competitiveness) and an asset
for intra-regional integration and integration with the EU.

ERAWATCH (2008) Analytical Country Reports 2008: 

Bulgaria, Slovenia, Romania. European Commission,
Brussels. Available at http://cordis.europa.eu/erawatch

Countries also have points in common. Demand for R&D
tends to be weaker than supply, with the notable
exception of Slovenia. Even supply is hampered by
continuing severe external brain drain.

In those countries with functioning R&D systems, namely
Bulgaria, Croatia, Romania and Serbia, there is a need to
broaden the focus of science and innovation policy and to
link public R&D to the countries’ industrial, agricultural and
health care sectors. These countries also need to make
better use of international assistance to integrate R&D into
the European Research Area and to facilitate linkages
between the EU and domestic systems of innovation.

There has been some limited progress in integrating the
Western Balkan countries into the European Research
Area. International stakeholders are aware of the need to
support S&T to facilitate this integration and ensure long-
term growth. However, this will necessitate huge
improvements in infrastructure and a restructuring of the
countries’ S&T systems.

The Western Balkan countries in particular cannot afford
not to increase investment in R&D funding, even though
the benefits are sometimes only seen in the long term.
The alternative would be for them to fall farther behind
the rest of Europe in terms of economic development.
However, this increase should be accompanied by a
strong focus on funding both excellence and locally
relevant research. This will require fair competition,
priority-setting, transparency and international criteria of
excellence.

The ‘Europeanization’ of the region’s R&D systems via EU
research networks will serve to connect the research
endeavours of countries in Southeast Europe with the best
the EU can offer in terms of R&D teams. We can expect a
better balance between incentives (selection through
project funding) and stability (the share of institutional
funding). However, the bottleneck caused by little
domestic demand for R&D and a weak private sector in all
but Slovenia is likely to remain a major structural weakness
in Southeast European R&D systems for years to come.

INTRODUCTION

Turkey is a regional power bridging East and West. In
recent years, it has experienced dynamic growth and rapid
recovery from a severe economic crisis in 2001. Today, the
Turkish economy is among the world’s 20 largest, with
GDP of over US$ 500 billion.

Turkey has a young population: 64% are under 34 years of
age. Population growth is the highest among countries of
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD), the population having climbed from
53 million in 1986 to 73 million in 2006. Turkey also possesses
a larger labour force than any of the 27 countries that make
up the European Union, with an active population of over
24.7 million in 2007, according to the Turkish Investment
Support and Promotion Agency. The population is very
urbanized, with 67% of Turks living in towns or cities,
according to the United Nations Statistical Division.

To spur recovery from the 2001 crisis, Turkey adopted
structural reforms that included exchange-rate flotation,
privatization, strengthening the administration of
revenue, creating a better climate for investment and
reforming both social security and the financial and
energy sectors. These measures succeeded in
regenerating growth and putting an end to chronic
inflation. By 2007, GDP had grown to 5.1%, compared to 
-7.5% six years earlier. At 8.8% in 2007, inflation was at its

lowest for almost 30 years. Although still lower than the
rates of the past three decades, inflation did climb to
10.1% in 2008.

With average annual GDP growth of 4.2% between 
1988 and 2007, Turkey ranked fifth among OECD economies
by 2008 for this indicator. Estimated growth for 2008 is 3.4%,
according to Eurostat. Improvements have also been
observed in other indicators, such as in terms of labour
productivity and the level of foreign direct investment (FDI).

The structural reforms have also strengthened the
regulatory and supervisory role of the State in the
economy by boosting the private sector’s role. Since 2003,
economic growth has been driven by the private sector,
particularly in the automotive industry and the machinery
and equipment sectors (Figure 1). Total exports doubled
between 2005 and 2008, from US$65 billion to
US$132 billion. Turkey’s main export partners are
Germany (11.2%), the UK (8.0%), Italy (7.0%), France
(5.6%), Spain (4.3%) and the USA (3.9%), according to the
Turkish Statistics Institute (Turkstat).

The economic upturn suddenly went into reverse in early
2009, as the impact of the global economic recession
began making its presence felt. Turkish exports
plummeted 35% in February alone over the same period
the previous year, falling to US$6.87 billion, according 
to the Turkish Exporters Association. Although the

automotive sector was also hit hard, it still managed to 
pocket export earnings of US$1.98 billion.

Second to Turkey’s car industry is the iron and steel
industry, with exports worth US$984 million. This is
followed by the ready-to-wear clothing industry, with
exports amounting to US$967 million. Among the early
indicators of the recession, the number of new companies
was down by 34.7% in February 2009 over the previous
year, according to Turkstat, and unemployment was up
from 9.7% in 2007 to 10.9% in 2008.

POLICY OBJECTIVES

Turkey has a long tradition of science and technology
(S&T) policy-making. This dates back to the 1960s when
this exercise was an integral part of development plans.
The country also has a well-developed institutional
framework. Since the turn of the century, Turkey has
attached increasing importance to investment in science,
technology and innovation (STI) for sustainable socio-
economic development. The key milestones have been:

I The implementation of the Vision 2023 Project

(2002–2004), a technology foresight study aimed at
achieving the widest participation possible and greater
commitment around a shared vision for the
formulation of STI strategies for the next two decades.

I Full association with the Sixth Framework Programme
of the European Union (EU) in 2003. Turkey provided
this programme with €250 million, the largest
contribution among the EU candidate countries; Turkey
is expected to contribute €423.5 million to the current
Seventh Framework Programme by the end of 2013.

I The launch in 2004 of the Turkish Research Area
(TARAL) by the Supreme Council of Science and
Technology (BTYK)1 and identification of the main
targets for science and technology (S&T).

I The approval by BTYK in 2005 of the five-year

implementation plan for the National Science and
Technology Strategy (2005–2010) and of the new
priority areas of technology.

The Ninth Development Plan (2007–2013), issued in 2006,
reflects Turkey’s growing political commitment to S&T.
The plan forms the basis for other national and regional
plans and programmes and for the documents required
by the EU for the accession process. It defines improving
STI performance as one of the building blocks for greater
competitiveness. The main policy objective of the
Medium-Term Programme (2008–2010), published by the
State Planning Organization (SPO) of Turkey, is ‘to become
capable in STI and to transform this capability into
economic and social value by enhancing the innovation
skills of the private sector specifically’ (SPO, 2007).

The basic objectives of the National Science and
Technology Strategy (2005–2010) are to improve living
standards, solve social problems, develop competitiveness
and raise public awareness of S&T. This is to be achieved
by stimulating demand for research and development
(R&D), enhancing the quality and quantity of scientists,
other professionals and technical personnel and
increasing gross expenditure on R&D (GERD).

In line with these goals, two primary targets were fixed by
BTYK in 2005. These targets were subsequently revised in
2008: the country’s GERD/GDP ratio is to nearly quadruple
from 0.53%2 in 2002 to 2.0% by 2013, half of this share
being funded by the private sector (Figure 2);

secondly, the number of full-time equivalent (FTE) research
personnel is to be carried from 28 964 in 2002 to 
150 000 by 2013 (Figure 3). The number of vocational and
technical staff is also to be increased proportionally.

In 2005, BTYK also identified priority areas of technology
for capacity-building, including the following:

I information and communication technologies (ICTs);
I biotechnology and genetic technologies;
I material technologies;
I nanotechnologies;
I design technologies;
I mechatronics;3
I production processes and technologies;
I energy and environmental technologies.

Thanks to a strong political commitment, public 
expend iture on S&T has taken off since 2005, with more than 
US$1.5 billion being allocated to the Scientific and Techno -
logical Research Council of Turkey (TÜBITAK) alone for R&D
programmes in the period 2005–2008. This, along with other
factors like economic growth, caused R&D expenditure to
almost triple between 2002 and 2007 (Figure 4).

However, political commitment has been weaker when 
it comes to translating the technology foresight exercise,
Vision 2023, into policy initiatives. No special effort has 
been made since 2005 to build capacity in the priority
technology areas identified by BTYK in 2005. This is a policy
challenge that the government will need to address.

It is important for Turkey to channel R&D resources
strategically into priority technology fields rather than
spreading them thinly across generic programmes.
The priority areas identified by Vision 2023 are fields in
which Turkey recognizes the need to build critical knowledge
and technological capacities for the next 20 years. The
majority of the priority fields, such as nanotechnologies,
ICTs and design technologies, are general-purpose
technologies with numerous potential applications for
productive sectors in Turkey. Thematic measures

2.   In 2008, the GDP series were changed and Turkstat recalculated the
GERD/GDP ratios. Using the new series, the 2002 ratio now stands at 0.53%,
against 0.66% previously.

3.  Mechatronic systems consist of mechanical, electronic and control
components. Robots are the most common product but mechatronics can
also be used to develop mind-controlled artificial limbs, (ecological)
transport systems and so on.

– as opposed to generic ones – will be vital to boost STI in the
priority areas identified for socio-economic development.

The need to invest in these priority areas is also evident from
statistics on GERD in relation to Turkey’s socio-economic
objectives (Figure 5). For example, although energy and
environmental technologies figure among the priority fields,
between 2003 and 2007, govern ment expenditure on R&D
only increased from 2.2% to 4.6% for ‘control and care of the
environment’ and from 3.3% to 4.3% for ‘production,
distribution and rational use of energy’.

R&D INPUT
R&D expenditure
Between 2003 and 2007, GERD more than doubled in
Turkey, from US$ 2.8 billion (PPP) to US$6.8 billion (PPP).
This growth rate is substantially higher than the EU-27
average (9%) and matched globally only by China.
In terms of growth in R&D intensity, also known as the
GERD/GDP ratio, Turkey ranks fourth in the world after
China, South Africa and the Czech Republic for
2002–2007, according to TÜBITAK: R&D intensity grew by

34% in Turkey between 2002 and 2007, compared to 36%
in the Czech Republic and 39% in South Africa. Turkey is
no match for China, though, where R&D intensity grew by
as much as 51% between 2002 and 2007. The GERD/GDP
ratio in Turkey is expected to continue rising, despite the
global economic recession.

Between 2004 and 2007, the share of business
expenditure on R&D (BERD) in total spending climbed by
nearly 60% in Turkey. The catalyst was a boost in public
support for R&D in 2004, which saw BERD rise overnight to
34%. However, the share of higher education in R&D
spending remains high and, even at 48%, Turkish BERD
remains well below the OECD average of 69% (Figure 6).

Enlarging the research pool
The government attaches great importance to boosting
the numbers of R&D personnel, one of the key targets of
the National Science and Technology Strategy, as we have
seen above. At first glance, there has been a remarkable
increase in both the numbers of FTE R&D personnel and
FTE researchers, as seen in Figure 3. However, the main
reason for the increase since 2003 is the change in the
way Turkstat defines FTE R&D personnel and researchers
in surveys.

In point of fact, as of 2006, the number of researchers per
1 000 members of the labour force remains low in Turkey
(2.0), both by EU-27 standards (5.8) and in comparison
with individual Eastern European countries like Poland
(4.7) [World Bank, 2008].

In order to reach the ambitious target of 150 000 FTE
research personnel by 2013, Turkey will need to devote
more resources to tertiary education, swell university rolls
and graduation rates and attract Turkish PhD students
living abroad. Turkey devotes 1.1% of GDP to public
spending on tertiary education; although this is
comparable with many countries or better, it remains below
the level of Scandinavian countries (World Bank, 2007). The
number of Turkish PhD students who remain in the USA for
five years or more is close to 60%, the fifth-largest
proportion after China, India, Iran and Argentina (Box 1).

Enrollment rates in higher education are lower for Turkey
than for most countries with similar or higher levels of
income. Just 11% of Turks in the 25–34 year-old bracket
have a tertiary degree, the lowest rate of any OECD
country: the OECD average is 31%.

Furthermore, Turkey needs to increase enrollment and
graduation rates among women. The gross enrollment
ratio for female students in tertiary education in 2006 
was 30%, compared to a regional average of 66%
(UNESCO Institute for Statistics). Turkey had 5.7 new
science and engineering graduates per 1 000 population
in 2005, corresponding to 44% of the EU-27 average. 
This remains low but a positive trend is emerging:
between 1995 and 2004, Turkey’s average annual 
growth in R&D personnel was as high as Finland’s and
among the top three in the world, even though this was
partially due to its much lower starting point (World 
Bank, 2008).

Building a science culture and a society open to STI calls
for an education system capable of providing pupils with
the requisite skills from an early age. To meet this
challenge and that of developing a larger pool of
researchers, the government has been implementing
various measures since 2004; these range from revising
primary and secondary curricula to measures designed to
stimulate the international mobility of students and
scientists (see for example Box 2).

Box 1: The Tale of a Turkish PhD Returnee

Dr Batu Erman was the 2008 winner of
the prestigious European Marie Curie
Excellence Award. He completed his
PhD in the USA in 1998 before moving
back to Turkey in 2004 to take up a post
at Sabancı University in Istanbul. In the
USA, he had been a postdoctoral fellow
and research associate at the National
Institutes of Health until 2004.

At 40, Dr Erman does not consider
himself unique among the academics
at Sabancı University: the average age is
43, over 85% received their PhD outside
Turkey and over 45% have conducted
postdoctoral research abroad in
academia or industry. Nor does he
consider Sabancı University unique in
its ability to recruit a young generation
of highly trained faculty members.

Dr Erman’s laboratory at Sabancı
University conducts basic research in
immunology using techniques from
molecular biology. In his laboratory, he
works with some of the many ‘young,
enthusiastic, ambitious life scientists

who are setting up shop in Turkish
universities’. These young scientists
choose to teach and conduct research
in Turkey, not because this is a ‘safe’
choice but for the thrill of choosing a
challenging alternative to staying in the
USA after a postdoctoral fellowship.

Dr Erman is currently training six
MSc students, two doctoral students
and two postdoctoral scientists.
He has also helped to organize an
association of 15 molecular biologists
from eight different universities in
Istanbul, Ankara and Izmir. These
scientists have all been trained at
prestigious universities and institutes
in the USA, Europe and Japan. All are
in the same age group, all are eager to
teach a new generation of life
scientists and all have the ‘pioneer
spirit’. For Dr Erman, the members of
this group are typical of the new
generation of scientists who want to
create a culture of conducting basic
research in Turkey. He admits that this

means tackling problems that may not
exist in North America, Western
Europe or Japan, in addition to the
customary hardships associated with
conducting research.

Dr Erman’s Marie Curie Excellence

Award was publicized in the
mainstream media in Turkey as
illustrating the success of a Turkish
scientist. As a result, he was contacted
by many non-scientists curious to
know more about immunology,
molecular biology and the research his
team is conducting. According to
Dr Erman, there may be limited job
oppor tunities but, even so, Turkish
society views a career in science as
being ‘cool’. He observes that there is a
large pool of highly qualified, well
educated, English-speaking, young
researchers in the Turkish education
system.

R&D OUTPUT

ENRICHING THE POLICY MIX

Scientific publications on the rise
Since 2002, Turkey has been stepping up R&D output as
well. The number of research publications continues to
rise, from 15 403 in 2004 to 21 779 in 2007 (Figure 7). This
is mainly due to the fact that a large portion of R&D is
conducted at universities, which employ the majority of
researchers, and to the increase in R&D funding. Turkey’s
ranking in journals covered by the Science Citation Index
(SCI) has likewise improved, from 41st in 1990 to 19th in
2005. In the SCI, Turkey is most visible in clinical medi cine,
followed by engineering and technology (Figure 8).

A similar trend can be observed in patents. Patent 
Co-operation Treaty applications from Turkey have been
growing since 2004 (Figure 9). In addition, domestic
patent filings and grants rose more than four-fold from
2002 to 2007, according to the Turkish Patent Institute.

To support these positive trends, the government has
been enriching the STI policy mix, particularly since late
2006. This policy mix now addresses a broad range of
needs on the part of the research community and
industry.

Overall, the existing policy mix focuses on five main
categories: (1) raising expenditure on research and
technological innovation in private enterprises,
(2) intensifying co-operation on R&D projects between
public or university research and private enterprises, 
(3) swelling the number of new innovation-intensive
enterprises and their chances of survival, (4) increasing the
rate of commercial ization/marketing of the results of R&D
conducted by public research bodies and the university
sector (Elçi, 2008), and (5) developing human resources 
for S&T.

Generic government programmes to support R&D
In terms of government support for public R&D,
programmes tend to be generic in nature, as opposed to
thematic, with no focus on specific areas for capacity-
building. Typical of this approach is the Support
Programme for Research Projects of Public Institutions,
implemented by TÜBITAK. This programme provides R&D
projects with financial support to develop new products
and processes to meet the needs of public organizations.
Since its inception in 2005, the programme has supported
83 projects from a total budget of €123 million. The top
10 beneficiaries of the programme are, in descending order, 
the Undersecretariat of National Defence, the
Undersecretariat for Defence Industries, the Ministry of
Agriculture and Rural Affairs, the Ministry of Energy and
Natural Resources, the Ministry of Public Works and
Settlement, the Social Security Institute, the Ministry of the
Environment and Forestry, the Ministry of Transport, the
Directorate-General of Security and the Ministry of Health.

UNESCO SCIENCE REPORT 2010

Thematic government programmes to support R&D
Defence, space and nuclear technologies are the only
three fields supported through thematic programmes.
The Defence Research Programme has been implemented
by TÜBITAK in co-operation with the Ministry of Defence
since 2005. As of December 2008, 39 projects were being
funded, to the tune of about €243 million.

The National Space Research Programme has been carried
out by TÜBITAK since 2005 with the involvement of the
Turkish Armed Forces, related ministries, universities and
private companies. TÜBITAK’s Space Technologies
Research Institute is actively involved in the
implementation of projects under this programme.
TÜBITAK also manages an international scholarship
programme to develop human resources in the field of
space technologies; in 2008, 10 students were selected
from among 294 applicants to attend graduate
programmes abroad. This programme is accompanied by
a scheme to make pupils and their teachers more aware of
space and space sciences: seminars, training courses and
visits to the National Observatory are organized by
TÜBITAK. A recent development under this programme is
BTYK’s decision to create a National Space Technologies
Platform to initiate dialogue and stimulate two- and
three-way collaboration among the private and public
sectors and academia in this area. In parallel, Turkey is
taking steps to intensify international scientific
collaboration in space science and technology. The 
most significant development in this respect has been 
the closer ties forged with the European Space Agency,
which has led Turkey to apply for membership.

The National Nuclear Technologies Development 
Research Programme is being implemented for the 
period 2007–2015 by the Turkish Atomic Energy 
Authority (TAEK), in co-operation with the Ministry of
Energy and Natural Resources. The programme aims to
establish a centre offering research and training in the
field of nuclear technologies.

Wooing the private sector
An important impediment to a flourishing Turkish STI
system is the underdeveloped venture capital and business
angels market. The total fund for venture capital and private
equity is estimated at around €400 million and annual
investments at no more than €100 million. Only a handful of
these investors prefer to invest in small and medium-sized
enterprises (SMEs) and almost none have chosen to invest in

start-ups at an early stage. Similarly, investments by business
angels are low and the small number of business angel
networks makes this an elusive option for entrepreneurs in
search of finance. This insufficient funding at an early stage
is an obstacle to the development of the venture capital
industry, as initial funding of start-ups by business angels
helps to generate more deal flow4 for venture capital
investments (Elçi, 2008).

In 2001, the government set up a Co-ordination Council
for Improving the Investment Climate under the reform
programme of the same name. The council acts through
12 technical committees which focus on company start-
ups, employment, sectoral licenses, localities for
investment, taxes and incentives, foreign trade and
customs, intellectual and industrial property rights, FDI
legislation, investment promotion, small and medium-
sized enterprises, corporate management and R&D.

The council’s R&D Technical Committee was established
in January 2008. The core action plan currently being
implemented by the committee members revolves around:

I developing university–industry collaboration;
I promoting R&D awareness in society;

4.   ‘Deal flow’ refers to the rate at which investment offers are submitted to
funding bodies.

Box 2: Learning about innovation in Turkey’s schools

Innovation has been taught since
2006 in Turkish secondary schools as
part of a compulsory course in
technology and design, thanks to a
private–public partnership entitled
Triggering a Cultural Change for
Innovation (Project Ekin). The project
was implemented by the Technology
Management Association (TYD)
between 2005 and 2006, in 
co-operation with the Technopolis
Group, Bilkent University, the Turkish
Informatics Association, METU
Technology Park and the newspaper
Referans, and with the participation of
the Board of Education of the Ministry
of Education.

The project was one of the
winning proposals of the World
Bank’s Turkey Development

Marketplace Competition in the
category ‘Social inclusion and
progress on the way to Europe’.
Three schools participated in the pilot
phase; two from a developed region
of Turkey and one from a less
developed region.

In the first of two stages, the

curriculum was defined, a book was
produced and the teachers were
trained. In the second stage, the
pupils received instruction from their
teachers, in accordance with the
prepared content. The pupils also
experienced real-life examples of
innovation and entrepreneurship by
visiting several innovative companies
located in science parks. After these
visits, each school formed four teams
to develop their own innovative

ideas, establish virtual companies and
prepare business plans. A group of
university students trained in the
subject material coached these 
12 virtual companies throughout the
business planning process.

The pilot project ended with an
event at which the teams presented
their ideas for innovation and their
business plans. Participants were
invited to visit the virtual companies
established by the pupils and
become their ‘business angels’ by
buying virtual shares in those in
which they preferred to invest.
The three companies that received
the most investment were presented
with an award.

researchers;

I developing international R&D co-operation;
I investigating what motivates foreign multinationals to

invest in R&D in a particular country;

I ameliorating the quality of data to improve Turkey’s

ranking in international innovation indexes.

In addition, the government has devised a number of
instruments to foster private-sector R&D, ranging from
grants to soft loans. Tax incentives for R&D, which have
been provided for technoparks since 2001, have been
broadened by the Law on the Support of Research and
Development Activities, ratified in 2008. The new
incentives under this law aim to boost investment in R&D
and attract the R&D branches of foreign companies to the
country. The law also sets out to encourage collaboration
on R&D and to stimulate the creation of technology-based
firms. It is implemented by the Ministry of Industry and
Trade in co-operation with the Ministry of Finance.

In regional S&T systems, technoparks are one of the 
key instruments being used by the government to
increase private investment in R&D. By 2008, 31 techno -
parks had been approved in Turkey by the Ministry of

Industry and Trade, under the Technology Development
Zones Law of 2003.

Eighteen of these technoparks are currently active and
house 890 companies – 32 of them foreign – which 
employ 9 475 people, 78% of whom are researchers. 
These companies are implementing 2 671 R&D projects 
in ICTs, electronics, defence, telecommunications,
medical/biomedical research, new materials, industrial
design and environmental technologies. They accounted 
for US$250 million of export revenue in 2008, up from
US$144 million in 2006, according to the Ministry of Industry
and Trade. Technoparks are provided with a broad range of
incentives, including generous tax benefits, to encourage
business R&D and help close the gap between the business
sector and the research community.

The role of non-profit bodies in fostering STI
In parallel to the greater government commitment to S&T,
both private non-profit bodies and non-governmental
organizations (NGOs) have been highly effective in creating
awareness of STI. Two examples are the Innovation Association
and the National Innovation Initiative (Elçi, 2008). The latter is a
platform comprised of leading executives from the private
sector, rectors of several established universities and leaders

from some of the more influential NGOs in Turkey. The
initiative develops and recommends strategies to the
government in the field of innovation. Moreover, since 2004,
there has been a marked increase in initiatives by private
non-profit bodies and NGOs to increase private investment
in STI.

These bottom-up developments have also fostered a
regional approach to the governance of technology and
innovation: regional innovation strategies have started being
designed and new models of innovation intermediaries have
been established. Two examples are the relay centres
(Box 3) and regional innovation centres, developed by the
Turkish Industrialists and Businessmen’s Association
jointly with the Turkish Enterprise and Business
Confederation. In parallel, the introduction of regional
development agencies has broadened funding
opportunities for regional organizations engaged in

STI activities: private enterprises, universities and public
research institutes.

International co-operation
International co-operation in STI is an important policy
objective of the Turkish government. A key element of this
is the integration of the Turkish Research Area (TARAL)
with the European Research Area. A big step in this
direction has been Turkey’s involvement in the European
Union’s Research Framework Programmes, as well as in
the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework
Programme. As we have seen earlier, it is estimated that
Turkey’s contribution to the current Seventh Framework
Programme will total €423.5 million by the end of 2013. 
In addition to research collaborations with the EU, Turkey
has a bilateral research agreement with a large number of
countries and TÜBITAK implements programmes to
stimulate international R&D partnerships.

Box 3: The Aegean Innovation Relay Centre

The Aegean Innovation Relay Centre
(IRC-Ege) has been selected as the
best of its kind by the EU, out of 
71 centres in 33 countries. It was
established in April 2004 under the
auspices of Ege University Science
and Technology Centre (EBILTEM), the
Aegean Region Chamber of Industry
(EBSO), the Izmir Ataturk Organized
Industrial Zone (IAOSB) and the Small
and Medium Industry Development
Organization (KOSGEB) as one of two
innovation relay centres in Turkey.

The IRC-Ege has been providing

R&D services in 14 provinces of
Western Anatolia. IRC-Ege has been
pro-active in promoting its services
and creating awareness of R&D and
innovation among SMEs in the
region. In addition to conferences,
road shows, television programmes
and so on, since its inception, IRC-Ege
has visited 706 companies and
conducted 124 technology audits,
bringing to light 83 new

technologies. In order to promote
these new technologies, which were
developed by Turkish SMEs in the
region, the centre has organized and
participated in 111 brokerage events
Europe-wide. It has also acted as go-
between by passing on ‘technology
requests’ submitted by the regional
SMEs to the members of the EU
Innovation Relay Centres network.
Some 2084 bilateral meetings were
organized during these events
between Turkish and European SMEs
with the centre’s assistance.

This hive of activity has led to 

67 transnational technology transfers
(TTT) between Turkish and European
companies. Thirty of these transfers
emanated from Turkish companies,
with the technology transferred to
companies in European countries
including Bulgaria, the Czech Republic,
Finland, Greece and Italy, while 
37 involved transfers from European
companies towards Turkish companies.

In addition, eight Turkish companies
have also entered into business
partnerships with other European
companies with the help of IRC-Ege.
The value added to the Turkish

economy through these technology
transfers is estimated at around 
€42 million. Eleven of the SMEs that
made a technology transfer had not
contacted any foreign companies for
any reason prior to being approached
by IRC-Ege. Another 15 SMEs do not
employ anyone who speaks a foreign
language. Two technology-based
start-ups were created after inward
technology transfers enabled them to
begin producing new products and
services for the domestic market.

Nearly 260 new jobs have been

created in Western Anatolia as a result
of the TTT. In addition, some SMEs
have taken on extra staff to keep
abreast of new technologies via the
IRC network and to participate actively
in activities organized by IRC-Ege.

CONCLUSION

Turkey has demonstrated remarkable progress in STI in the
new Millennium. The challenge now will be to boost output
from S&T and to transform R&D results into innovation and
viable business opportunities for the benefit of both society
and the economy. In this respect, public intervention needs
to address longer-term drivers and relatively short-term
direct needs of the private sector and academia.

To this end, the key recommendations that follow include
further investment in developing human capital in STI;
facilitating knowledge creation and diffusion and;
increasing the number of innovative high-growth
enterprises, which generate new jobs:

I There needs to be greater investment in education at

all levels. Particular attention should be paid to
expanding enrollment, raising attainment levels and
improving the quality of education in tertiary
institutions. Curricula need to be aligned further on the
needs of the business sector. In addition, participation
in life-long learning should be stimulated through
postg raduate programmes, corporate training, online
learning and other means;

I Since the majority of research is performed by

universities, it is important to encourage the
commercialization of research results and the diffusion
of knowledge generated by universities. The
government’s efforts to encourage university–industry
collaboration should be reinforced by other measures
to facilitate spin-off formations, providing researchers
with training and mentoring in business planning and
other key topics such as intellectual property rights
management and the commercialization of products
and services. The government should also encourage
the creation of special ized institutions for technology
transfer. Moreover, support for the creation and
running of STI networks and clusters is essential to
foster knowledge generation and diffusion among
knowledge producers and enterprises;

I It is important for Turkey to focus on priority 

I To increase the number of innovative high-growth
enterprises, innovation capabilities in existing firms
need to be improved and more measures put in place
to facilitate the creation of innovative enterprises.
Existing firms need to be made aware of the vital
importance of innovation and to be given incentives to
develop their capabilities. It is equally important to
attract investment in the form of venture capital and
via business angels, in tandem with tax incentives for
innovative start-ups.

These and other policy measures, combined with a lasting
government commitment to stimulating STI in Turkey, will
not only allow the country to close the gap with the
developed nations but also ensure that it reaps the social
benefits of higher productivity and economic growth.

INTRODUCTION

According to the strategic document adopted by the
Russian government in 2008, Long-Term Social and
Economic Development to 2020: A Policy Framework 
(LTDP-2020), Russia had completed its transition to a
market economy and the transformation of its social and
political systems by the turn of the century (Government
of Russian Federation, 2008). 

Since 2005, economic trends in Russia have clearly fallen
into two distinct periods. During the first period
(2005–2007), the economy grew and quality of life
gradually improved, thanks largely to high oil prices and
an initially weak currency, combined with rising domestic
demand, consumption and investment. 

The country then experienced a severe economic
downturn in the last quarter of 2008, caused by a global
financial crisis and subsequent economic recession (Table 1).
In an effort to combat the repercussions of this recession,
the Russian government, like governments elsewhere,
developed an extensive national recovery package, 
The Anti-crisis Plan for the Russian Federation (Government
of Russian Federation, 2009). This package is expected to
help cushion the social cost of the recession, maintain a
robust financial system and support some key industrial
sectors, such as motor vehicle and aircraft manufacture,
metallurgy and pharmaceut icals. This will require
substantial public funds; the recovery package cumulated

at about US$ 88.4 billion for 2008–2010 and represented
approximately 9% of Russian GDP for 2009. Experts
believe, however, that the recovery package may
aggravate the risk of immoderate government
intervention in the economy and slow down certain
institutional reforms, particularly those intended to bring
about a radical modernization of the economy and reform
the country’s science, technology and innovation (STI)
system (INSOR, 2009). 

The current economic recession is making it even more
difficult for Russia to respond to pressing long-term global
challenges, such as demographic trends, health issues,
climate change and both energy and food security. These
challenges are exacerbating domestic weaknesses and
hampering the growth of the Russian economy. According to
the LTDP-2020, the gravest among these weaknesses include:

I Russia’s dependence on raw materials, with economic

growth and a better quality of life being ensured
chiefly by export earnings from oil, gas and other raw
materials;

I persistent structural imbalances in the economy and a

technological gap with leading industrial nations; 
I the monopolization of most local markets, which

suppresses incentives to improve productivity and
competitiveness;

I persistent barriers to entrepreneurship and inadequate

protection of ownership rights, including intellectual
property rights;

UNESCO SCIENCE REPORT 2010

I a lack of appropriate incentives and conditions for
fostering a ‘pragmatic coalition’ between business, 
the government and the public; 

I a low level of confidence in state authorities, 

combined with the insufficient effectiveness of 
public governance;

I glaring economic and social differences between

regions; and

I a number of social issues, such as the significant

inequality in income distribution and in the
development of social infrastructure. 

All this makes Russia’s position extremely vulnerable and
unsustainable in the long term and prevents a rapid
transition to post-crisis recovery and growth. The President
of the Russian Federation, Dmitry Medvedev, conceded
this fact, in essence, when he decided to set up and head
the Commission for the Modernization and Technological
Development of Russia’s Economy in May 2009.

More recently, in his State of the Nation address to both
houses of Parliament on 12 November 2009, he said that
‘We must start modernising and technologically
upgrading the entire production sphere. This is an issue of
our country’s survival in today’s world.’  The President
spoke of the decision to develop new medicinal and space
technologies and telecomm unications, as well as to
‘radically increase energy efficiency.’ One target he cited
was for 50% of medicines commercialized in Russia to be
Russian-made by 2020. The President added that
government support would henceforth target those
companies with explicit plans to raise efficiency and
implement high-tech projects (President of the Russian
Federation, 2009).

R&D INPUT

Trends in R&D expenditure
Gross domestic expenditure on research and development
(GERD) in Russia almost doubled at constant prices during
1998–2008 (Figure 1). This is one of the highest growth rates
for R&D investment worldwide. However, current GERD in
Russia has still not climbed back to 1991 levels (it stands at
76.4%), nor even to half the level of 1990, the last year of
existence of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR). 

Federal budget allocations for civil R&D grew 1.3-fold
between 2005 and 2008 at constant prices, about 40% 
of which was allocated to supporting basic research. 
Also on the rise has been financial support for R&D
through public procurement procedures – such as within
the framework of federal targeted R&D programmes – 
as well as contributions to public science foundations,
grants to outstanding research scholars and international 
co-operation in science and technology (S&T).

As a consequence, the salaries of research staff have 
also gone up. These are now 8.5% higher than the 
average for the economy as a whole and 13.5% higher
than salaries in the manufacturing sector. The amount 
of R&D spent on each researcher in Russia 
(PPP US$ 40 100) nevertheless remains much lower
than in other leading countries such as Germany 
(PPP US$ 238 000), the USA (PPP US$ 233 000) or the
Republic of Korea (PPP US$173 000). Levels of 
expenditure in Russia are still insufficient to upgrade
radically the quality of research equipment to 
compensate for years of neglect, even though this is a
crucial factor in ensuring excellence in R&D (Box 1).

Box 1: Russia’s inadequate facilities for research

For many years, Russia has neither
upgraded on a grand scale nor
replaced or acquired machinery,
equipment and other facilities for
research when the need has made
itself felt. As a consequence, 
vital resources for research have 
now deteriorated or are in short
supply. 

One-quarter (25%) of the machinery
and equipment used for R&D in Russia
is more than 10 years old and 12.3%
more than 20 years old. The degree of
wear and tear has been calculated at
55.2%. Overall, the share of scientific
equipment in the aggregate value of
machinery and equipment in the
Russian R&D sector is 35.5%.

Installations specifically designed for
R&D are available at less than 7% of
R&D organizations and less than 20%
of them have their own experimental
base; for the former USSR, this figure
was 34%.

Russian Federation

This said, in absolute terms, Russia has managed to
conserve its place among the world’s top ten spenders
since 2000. During 2005–2008, GERD in Russia increased
from PPP US$18.1 billion to PPP US$24.5 billion. This still
places Russia far behind the USA (fifteen times higher),
Japan (six times higher), China (four times higher),
Germany (three times higher) and France (twice as high).
For the purposes of comparison, Russia trailed only the
USA, Japan, Germany and France in 1991 after the
collapse of the Soviet Union. As for Russia’s GERD/GDP
ratio of 1.03% (2008), this is lower than in 2007 (1.12%)
and a far cry from its level of 1.43% in 1991. Russia ranks
31st for this indicator in OECD and UNESCO publications
(Gokhberg, 2007, pp. 10–11).

Over the past few years, there has been little improvement
in the structure of R&D funding and performance, or in the
socio-economic objectives of GERD. Demand for R&D in
Russia still comes mostly from the government, which
remains the key source of R&D funding at around 65% of
GERD. The continuing large share of the state budget
dedicated to R&D is a necessity to a certain extent,
reflecting the weakness of all other sources of funding. 
The business sector provides just 29% of GERD, a share
that has even fallen slightly since 2005 (30%). 

However, the roles of the government and business
sectors are reversed when it comes to performing R&D.
Here, it is the business sector (including both private
and publicly owned companies) which performs nearly
two-thirds of R&D and the government sector just 30%.
Higher education institutions contribute the remaining
7%. Our analysis suggests that, unless it is accompanied
by strong government incentives for private investment
in R&D, growing public funding for R&D may increas -
ingly substitute company financing rather than
complementing it. 

Figure 2 shows government funding of R&D by socio-
economic objective. Major trends in this regard in
recent years are the stronger orientation of R&D
towards the needs of industry, a quite substantial focus
on non-oriented research (at a stable quarter of GERD)
and the still insufficient share of government funding
assigned to social and environmental issues, even
though these areas are no less important than others
for socio-economic progress in Russia. Energy-related
research, as well as that aimed at exploration and
exploitation of the Earth and atmosphere and civil
space applications, has recently gained a slightly
greater stake in the overall financing of R&D.

TRENDS IN HUMAN RESOURCES

An ageing research population
In 2008, there were 761 300 people engaged in R&D in
Russia, including researchers, technicians and support
staff. This represented 1.3% of the Russian labour force, or
0.6% of the total population. After several years of decline,
this number has now more or less stabilized. The same is
true for researchers, who totalled 375 800, or 49% of R&D
personnel, in 2008. In terms of the absolute numbers of
R&D staff, Russia is among the world leaders, coming only
after the USA, Japan and China. However, the dynamics
and structure of R&D personnel in Russia reveal an
unhealthy imbalance. Unlike in many other countries,
researchers in Russia account for less than half of R&D
personnel. The remainder are mostly support and auxiliary
staff (43%), rather than technicians serving the scientific
process (8%). As a result, Russia ranks 10th globally in
terms of the number of people engaged in R&D per
10 000 employees but 19th in terms of researchers. 
To compound matters, more than 70% of researchers in
Russia hold no advanced scientific degree. 

Between 2002 and 2008, the age structure of researchers
was marked by absolute growth in the two polar groups,
namely scientists under 30 years of age (up by nearly 18%)
and those aged 70 years and above (up by a factor of two).
Simultaneously, the ranks thinned of such creative age
groups as 40–49 year-olds (down by nearly 58%) and 

50–59 years (down by 13%). The bottom line is that about
40% of Russian researchers have overstepped the official
retirement age of 55 years for women and 60 years for
men. In 2008, researchers were 49 years old on average,
compared to an average age of 40 years for those working
in the national economy as a whole. 

A new type of university
The network of institutions of higher education is growing
steadily in Russia. By 2009, they numbered 1 134 across
the country. Of these, 660 are state-owned or municipal
institutions, the remainder being privately owned. 

Existing legislation defines three types of higher
education institution: universities with multi-profile
research activity (53% of the total), academies with 
mono-profile research activity (25%), and institutes that
conduct no research at all (22%). In addition, a fourth 
type was introduced in 2008–2009, the federal university.
This is a large-scale institution usually resulting from the
merger of smaller local universities to become a key
educational centre for macroregions. So far, the
government has decided to inaugurate seven such
universities in Russia: in the city of Rostov-on-Don in the
south of the country, in the Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk, 
in Arkhangelsk (the European North), in Kazan (Volga
Region), in Ekaterinburg (Urals), in Yakutsk (East Siberia)
and in Vladivostok (Far East); other candidate institutions
are under consideration.

Box 2: Higher education popular in Russia 

According to the 2002 population
census, 19.0 million people aged 
over 15 years hold university degrees
in Russia. This represents about 
16.0% of the overall population in 
this age group, compared to 
11.3% in 1989. Among those aged
20–29 years, the share is nearly the
same: 16.1%. 

Regular surveys of household

attitudes to education show that the
majority (77%) of respondents with
children aged between 4 and 22 years
consider higher education to be
important for their children’s future;
56% of households say they would be
willing to invest in higher education.
University degrees are valued for the

crucial role they play in obtaining
well-paid positions (72% of
respondents), becoming highly
demanded professionals (45%),
achieving success and enjoying
rewarding careers (41%), and securing
interesting and creative jobs (22%).

Source: Petrenko et al. (2007) ); HSE (2009a)

The status of a given higher education institution in
terms of its allocation to one of these four categories
depends on the nature of the education and research
offered, as well as the comprehensiveness of educational
programmes. In the present chapter, we shall use the
generic term of ‘university’ to cover the various types of
higher education institutions, in the interests of
simplicity.

In 2008, 4.5% of university students were enrolled in
natural sciences and 18.6% in engineering. Medicine and
agriculture attracted 2.8% and 3.2% of student enrollment
respectively. Socio-economic and managerial disciplines
and the humanities have enjoyed sustainable demand
ever since a shortage in educational supply in this sphere
was revealed in the 1990s when market-oriented reforms
were launched. Within a few years, the situation had
righted itself to the point where concern was voiced at the
excessive numbers of lawyers, economists, managers,
accountants and the like being produced by universities.
Today, the proportion of graduates in these fields remains
unchanged: in 2008, 32.5% students in the public
university sector obtained degrees in economics and
management, 16.3% in humanities and 9.2% in education.
Private universities are even more reluctant than the public
sector to alter their policies and continue to turn out large
numbers of students specializing in the humanities (32.6%)
and in economics and management (58.4%). 

In 2008, the university enrollment rate in Russia was 
529 persons per 10 000 population, up from 495 in 2005 
(Box 2). Over the same period, the number of graduates
per 10 000 employees shrank from 198 to 172. Despite the
dynamic growth of private universities (by nearly one-third
during the 2000s), over 80% of all students – both

undergraduates and graduates – still pass through public
universities. In view of this large proportion and the after-
effects of the global economic recession, it would be
difficult to say what the future prospects will be for private
universities in Russia, especially considering the broad
criticism they have attracted for the quality of training they
offer. With stronger competition, those universities that are
unable to ensure quality education will be ousted from the
market. Another essential factor is the growth of student
bursaries: in 2008, nearly 59% of entrants admitted to
public universities were in possession of a bursary. This
trend is also having an impact on the way private
institutions of higher education function, since they mainly
serve local markets and usually have no substantial impact
on inter-regional student mobility. 

Modernizing the higher education system
The Russian higher education system has undergone
significant modernization in recent years. In addition to the
traditional five-year specialist training programme,
bachelor’s and master’s programmes have been
introduced (Figure 3). Since Russia only joined the Bologna
Convention in 2003 (see page 150), over 90% of graduates
with five years of study behind them still receive ‘specialist
with higher education’ diplomas; just over 1% obtain a
master’s degree after six years of study and 7% a bachelor’s
degree after four years of study.

The qualifications of lecturers have improved visibly. 
By early 2009, the number of Doctors of Science in public
universities had climbed to 42 100, or 12.3% of all faculty
staff, a proportion that includes those working part-time.
More than half of lecturers held a Candidate of Science
degree, equivalent to a PhD. In 2003, the proportions were
a little lower: 11.3% and 46.8% respectively.

The training of professionals with top scientific 
qualifications includes postgraduate programmes that
confer a Candidate of Science degree (equivalent to a PhD)
and doctoral courses leading to the highest scientific
degree in Russia, the Doctor of Science. In 2008, 
post graduate S&T programmes were offered by 
1 529 organizations, 718 of which were universities and
the remainder research institutes. Some 39% of these
organi zations – 388 universities and 205 research institutes
– also ran doctoral courses. 

Women made up just under half (43–45%) of the 
147 700 postgraduate and 4 200 doctoral students in 
S&T fields in 2008. Most of the postgraduates (88%) and
doctoral students (92%) specializing in scientific disciplines
are on the university payroll. This means that the training
of highly qualified scientists in Russia, like elsewhere, is
increasingly becoming a core mission of universities and a
top priority for them. Among disciplines for postgraduate
training, it is engineering, economics, law, medicine and
pedagogy which take the lead. Engineering and
economics also tend to attract the most doctoral students,
although their next preferences go to pedagogy, philology,
physics and mathematics. 

220

The dynamics of postgraduate training in Russia have
generally stabilized in recent years. However, this also
means that success rates have not improved: the
percentage of students who completed their thesis within
the prescribed period dropped from 30% to 26% in 2000–
2008 (and even from 23% to 15% in research institutes).
The average age of researchers upgrading their
qualifications has risen to 41 years for doctoral students
and 26 years for postgraduate students.

The national system for training scientific personnel and
providing certification still suffers from inefficiency and
inflexibility. The key concerns are: 

I the declining quality standards for theses; 
I the poor output of postgraduate and doctoral courses,
with most graduates failing to deliver their completed
theses on time; 

I protracted and excessive formalization of certification

procedures that are sometimes accompanied by biased
attitudes and lack of objective peer review; 

I the insufficient transparency of activities undertaken

by dissertation boards at some universities and
research institutes. 

These issues become even more alarming in light of the
shift announced by policy-makers towards an economy
where the capacity to innovate is crucial. In this context,
there is a need for efficient mechanisms to renew the stock
of highly qualified personnel and, in particular, to ensure
their high-quality training, promotion and rotation. This
also calls for conditions conducive to consolidating human
resources in S&T, education and high-tech industries. One
policy currently being considered is the instigation of a
separate advanced degree system for practitioners, such as
businessmen, civil servants and lawyers, to ensure
adequate recognition of their professional achievements in
a form other than advanced scientific qualifications.

MAJOR TRENDS AND KEY PROBLEMS
IN R&D
Greater support required for university research 
Russia’s higher education sector possesses significant S&T
potential and long-standing research traditions. However,
universities still play a minor role in new knowledge
production: in 2008, they contributed just 6.7% of GERD, 
a figure that has remained fairly stable for the past two

Russia chapter (7) [P3]:Layout 1  18/10/10  19:00  Page 221

Russian Federation

decades. Other key indicators also reflect a low engagement
of university staff in R&D (Figure 4). Only one out of three
universities performs R&D, compared with half (52%) in
1995. As for the private universities which emerged in the
1990s, they hardly perform any research at all. University
R&D laboratories have not yet become a magnet for
scientists. As a result, the population of full-time researchers
at universities remains relatively small but stable in most
cases: 28 900, or about 7.7 % of the country’s research pool.

In addition to insufficient, albeit growing government
support for university research, the higher education sector
faces serious problems that are to a large extent dependent
on available funding mechanisms. Public universities are
budget entities with legally limited rights. They receive
regular funding within the framework of educational
programmes primarily but only a handful are able to compete
with research institutes for tender-based R&D projects. 

Boosting support for university research has become one
of the most important strategic orientations of STI and
education policies in Russia. For instance, the National
Priority Project for Education (2006–2007) envisaged
competitive grants for universities implementing
innovative education programmes. It provided each of
these centres of excellence with additional funding of
approximately US$ 30 million in the form of two-year
institutional grants. These grants served to promote
human resource development, high-quality R&D and
educational projects, and the acquisition of research
equipment. There were 57 beneficiaries in 2006–2007. 
The main challenge today will be to ensure the
sustainability of this project (Gokhberg et al., 2009a). 

The National Priority Project for Education is not the only
government initiative to have provided centres of
excellence with support. In 2008, two Moscow-based
universities, the University of Engineering and Physics and
the University of Steel and Alloys, obtained the coveted
label of national research university, a status that should
channel subsequent incentives for R&D and educational
activities their way. In 2009–2010, a follow-up programme
selected another 27 national research universities in
different areas of S&T. 

Over the period 2009–2013, the federal programme
Science and Education Personnel for an Innovative Russia
(launched in 2008) is offering various incentives to attract
young talent and highly skilled professionals to
universities and R&D institutions. These incentives come in
the form of contest-based funding for advanced research
projects at science and education centres; and grants for
gifted young scientists, teachers and postgraduate
students, as well as for Russian scientists and teachers
returning from abroad. All of these initiatives will be
implemented regardless of any current financial obstacles.

In order to bring research institutes and universities closer
together and remove existing legal and administrative
barriers, a federal law on Changes to Selected Laws of the
Russian Federation concerning the Integration of Education
and Science was adopted in 2007. It provides a legal basis
for different models of integrating scientific research with
university training, such as setting up laboratories of
public research institutes on university grounds and
establishing specialized university departments at leading
research institutes.

UNESCO SCIENCE REPORT 2010

Conflicting trends in R&D
The R&D sector in Russia is still developing along
conflicting lines and remains subject to conflicting trends.
On the one hand, many positive changes can be observed,
which are particularly important since they mark a break
with a longlasting ‘big crisis’ period for Russian S&T.
Despite all the difficulties in the past two decades born of
the collapse of the USSR and the so-called shock-therapy
transition to a market economy, Russia has been able to
maintain its strong position in basic research and in certain
priority fields of applied R&D (examples being physics,
nuclear research, space, biotechnology, organic chemistry
and Earth sciences) to ensure an unbroken flow of
technology to industry. At the same time, the national
S&T sector continues to stagnate. It has three special
characteristics which still follow – to a certain extent – 
the Soviet model: 

I The S&T sector is relatively large in relation to its
productivity, centrally directed and government
financed (Kuznetsova, 1992; Gokhberg et al., 1997).
These features are ill-suited to a market economy;

I There is a striking imbalance between the country’s

performance in STI, on the one hand, and the growing
quantity of financial resources devoted to R&D, on the
other. Moreover, the lion’s share of these resources
mostly circulates beyond the realm of the industrial
and university sectors in public research institutions.
Market reforms of the national innovation system are
much slower and more superficial than those in other
sectors of the economy and remain incomplete.
Accordingly, while only 3–4% of businesses in the
Russian economy are still publicly owned, the figure 
for R&D-performing units is over 70% (Rosstat, 2008, 
pp. 349; HSE, 2009b, pp. 36–37). 

I Structural indicators demonstrate that the institutional

model of Russian S&T remains obsolete and erects
multiple barriers between R&D, industry and education;
this is impairing the quality of the supply of S&T in
Russia and weakening Russia’s position in the global
S&T arena. It will obviously be extremely difficult for
Russia to pursue its economic development and sustain
its competitive position if this model is not radically
amended. However, the S&T sector will not be able to
deal with the problems it faces in its development, nor
implement the necessary reforms effectively, as long as
it remains under the yoke of government. 

222

Changing the organizational structure 
of the R&D network
Institutions executing R&D in Russia have been sensitive to
demand. In 2000–2005, their number decreased by nearly
13%, whereas in 2005–2007, their number increased by
11%. It is hardly surprising that the latest financial crisis has
sent numbers plunging again: the network shrank by 7% in
2007–2008, from 3 957 units to 3 666.

However, the structure of the R&D network remains much
the same, given that the institutional features of Russia’s R&D
sector have changed little. As before, it is mostly dominated
by research institutes, industrial design bureaux and
technological organizations that are legally independent of
universities and industrial enterprises (Figure 5). This tradition
does not correspond to institutional arrangements
characteristic of mature market economies, where national
R&D sectors are typically led by industrial companies and
universities. On the contrary, the latter still play a minor
role in Russian R&D: according to official statistics, there were
only 239 industrial enterprises and 503 universities
engaged regularly in R&D in 2008 (HSE, 2010).

R&D OUTPUT

Trends in publications and patents
Deficiencies in Russia’s S&T sector are reflected in R&D
output and the impact of research applications on the
economy and society. In 2008, Russian scientists published
27 300 articles in the journals indexed in the Web of
Science, corresponding to 2.48% of the world total (HSE,
2010). For this indicator, Russia ranks 14th worldwide. This is
a drop from 7th place in 1995 and an even greater fall from
the 3rd place occupied by the former USSR in 1980. 

While patenting activity in Russia is relatively intensive, with
about 42 000 patent applications annually, placing Russia
6th worldwide, the share of registered licensing contracts in
the country is low: 5–6% of annually registered patents. This
can largely be explained by insufficient industrial demand
for innovation but also by the poor competitiveness of
Russian technologies, especially those destined for civilian
applications. The supply of technology is unsubstantial in
Russia and biased towards mostly unpatented R&D results.
Annual technology exports from Russia amount to just 
US$ 0.8 billion; this compares with US$ 2.5 billion for
Hungary, US$ 3.8 billion for Finland and US$ 85.9 billion 
for the USA.

If we take another indicator, Russia’s innovation activity
expressed as a percentage of the industrial enterprises
engaged in technological innovation has remained at
9–10% since 2000. The economies of the European Union
(EU) perform much better for this indicator, ranging from 
a low of 20% in Hungary to a high of 63% in Germany. 
At the same time, the substantial 1.6-fold increase in
expenditure on technological innovation in Russian
industry between 2000 and 2008 holds some promise for
domestic goods being more competitive in the future.

NEW STI POLICIES

Towards greater competitiveness and 
economic growth
The objectives of Russian STI policies since 2005 have been
largely determined by socio-economic and political factors.
As we have seen in Figure 1, the government was able to
pump considerable additional resources into the S&T
sector, thanks to high oil and gas prices up until the start of
the global recession in the third quarter of 2008. However,
Russia needs to deal with a whole set of complex
challenges simultaneously, including those connected with
the generation of new ideas, their commercialization and
transformation into efficient technologies and, lastly, the
production of competitive goods and services. STI policies
face the dual challenge of having to stimulate both the
demand and supply side of innovation markets. 

objectives of STI policies for the medium term and long
term. A most essential document, The Strategy for S&T and
Innovation in the Russian Federation until 2015 (2006),
establishes crucial new approaches to promoting allied
activities, as well as a system of programmes and other
policy instruments that are interrelated in terms of tasks,
timelines, resources and target indicators.

Another key document is the federal target-oriented
programme Research and Development in Priority Areas for
S&T Development in Russia for 2007–2012 (2006). It aims to
ensure accelerated development of the key segments of
the national innovation system that have immediate links
to priority S&T areas. 

More generally, concern over how to address new global
and national challenges underpins the president’s report
On the Strategy for Russia’s Development to 2020 (2008) and
the aforementioned LTDP-2020 with the same horizon of
2020. The report’s emphasis on the need to shift towards an
innovation-based scenario, dictated by the current state of
the national economy, is of utmost importance. It also
suggests that lessons could be learned from the experience
of other nations that have succeeded in retaining or
improving their global position by relying on effective
institutions and instruments of innovative growth. Both
documents also fix long-term objectives for S&T and socio-
economic development in Russia consistent with global
trends and national specificities and capabilities. 

In recent years, the Russian government has introduced 
a new cycle of strategic documents and implementation
programmes, laying down the foundations and major

Despite their inevitable adjustment in 2009 due to the
global recession, the measures outlined in LTDP-2020 will,
in the long run, make it possible to tackle the principal

223

Russia chapter (7) [P3]:Layout 1  18/10/10  19:00  Page 224

UNESCO SCIENCE REPORT 2010

systemic problems facing the national S&T sector, namely
an inefficient utilization of resources allocated to R&D,
combined with weak industrial demand for innovation. In
particular, LTDP-2020 outlines four broad policy objectives
for strengthening STI: 

I promoting industrial demand for new technology and

innovation; 

I increasing the quality and scale of national R&D

output;

I developing human capital capable of meeting the

challenges and requirements of an innovative
economy; and 

I establishing an effective system for fixing and attaining
R&D objectives and for setting and implementing long-
term R&D priorities.

SETTING NEW PRIORITIES FOR R&D 

Russia has an established system for identifying and
implementing R&D priorities so that resources can be
distributed effectively to a limited number of fields in
compliance with national development objectives,
internal and external challenges and limitations. The
current list of S&T priorities was approved by the President
of the Russian Federation on 25 May 2006. It includes
eight priority areas and 34 critical technologies. This list is
intended to help Russia address global issues, ensure
national competitiveness and promote innovation in key
areas. It is also expected to evolve over time in both size
and scope (Table 2). This list was used to design the
federal target-oriented programme Research and
Development in Priority Areas for S&T Development in Russia
for 2007–2012. This was in turn followed by a government
resolution Approving the Rules for Setting Up, Adjusting and
Implementing S&T Priority Areas and the List of Critical
Technologies of the Russian Federation (2009). 

A persistant priority: ICTs
A national S&T foresight exercise to 2025 was carried out in
Russia in 2007–2008 to develop a better approach to
identifying promising S&T areas and assessing their
technological potential for improving the competitiveness
of domestic industry. Figure 6 shows the results for the field
of ICTs obtained from a Delphi survey1 conducted within the
framework of the same foresight exercise. These estimates
are used in strategic documents on socio-economic

224

development and to define government policies for STI. A
new round of the foresight exercise up to 2030 was initiated
by the Ministry for Education and Science in 2009. 

An emerging priority: nanotechnology
Since the Strategy for Nanoindustry Development was
published at the President’s initiative in 2007, great
importance has also been attached in Russia to the
development and wider use of nanotechnology (President
of the Russian Federation, 2007). Owing to the economic
crisis Russia experienced in the first half of the 1990s in its
transition to a market economy, the country joined the
global nanotechnology race a little late. As a consequence,
its domestic ‘nanomarket’ is still in the early stages.
Nonetheless, the country has managed to preserve its
scientific potential in this domain, along with its world-class
expertise and unique scientific facilities, which include
synchrotron and neutron sources and atomic force
microscopy. Russia figures among the global leaders in a
number of specific areas of nanotechnology, including the
development of new construction materials, catalysts and
catalytic membranes; the production of biochips for rapid
analysis and diagnostics of dangerous infections and
diseases; light-emitting diodes and advanced light sources;
and new technological and diagnostic equipment using
these advanced technologies. Figure 7 shows how the level
of Russian nanotechnology R&D in certain areas compares
with state-of-the-art nanotechnology worldwide.

In order to mobilize organizational, material, financial and
intellectual resources in this priority area, earmarked
government programmes are being implemented. 
The list includes: 

I the Programme for Nanoindustry Development in

Russia to 2015;

I the federal target-oriented programmes for the

Development of Nanoindustry Infrastructure in Russia
for 2008–2010 and for Research and Development in
Priority Areas for S&T Development in Russia for 2007–
2012. The latter includes the priority area ‘industry of
nanosystems and materials’; and

I specialized publicly funded programmes in
nanotechnology conducted by state science
academies and science foundations.

1. The Delphi method uses a series of surveys to gather feedback from
experts on possible developments in particular areas in order to establish a
collective vision of the future.

UNESCO SCIENCE REPORT 2010

It is expected that, by 2015, all the necessary conditions will
be in place for large-scale manufacturing of new
nanotechnology-related products in Russia and for Russian
nanotech companies to enter global markets. 

In 2008–2009, the Higher School of Economics’ Institute for
Statistical Studies and Economics of Knowledge in Moscow
developed a new statistical methodology for collecting data
regularly on sales of nanotechnology-related products in
Russia. This project was carried out jointly with the Russian
Corporation for Nanotechnology (Rosnano) and the Federal
Statistical Service (Rosstat). Sales of nanotechnology-related
products in 2009 have been estimated at around 120 billion
roubles (approximately US$4 billion), a figure that could
grow to seven or eight times this amount by 2015.

RESTRUCTURING THE R&D SECTOR
A new status for R&D institutions 
The traditional dominance of the state-owned, state
budget-funded institutions that was characteristic of the
Soviet R&D model remains one of the key features of the
Russian S&T sector (Gokhberg et al., 1997). During the
transition to a market economy, various types of
commercial and non-profit R&D organizations were
allowed to develop but government R&D organizations
underwent little change. Nearly 43% of R&D institutes in
Russia are still fully government-funded. 

Just as national legislation imposes strict limitations on
public universities, so too does it on R&D institutes.

In many instances, this legislation contradicts academic
freedom and economic reality. Government R&D institutes
claim significant budgetary allocations but are not
expected to provide any guarantees as to the efficient use
of their budget. As a result, there is no immediate link
between performance and funding. This is particularly
true of state science academies (Box 3).

A new, more flexible legal model for state-owned
institutions has been provided by the federal Law on
Autonomous Institutions (2006). The new structures will
be funded through lump-sum subsidies rather than
through fixed budgetary institutional grants broken down
by specific cost items, as is the case at present. This new
approach is expected to provide better and more flexible
opportunities for the development of research institutions
and should increase their accountability when it comes to
research results. Although they will remain government-
owned entities, the new institutions will enjoy a certain
autonomy in attracting – and spending – funds from non-
governmental sources, including loans and investments. 

Another important domain of organizational change in
the Russian R&D landscape is the plan to establish several
large-scale national research centres in order to ensure
high-tech sectors obtain cutting-edge technology for the
development of  new products and processes. These new
centres are also expected to enjoy greater autonomy than

in the past. The first such research centre is the Kurchatov
Institute in Moscow. It has been responsible for co-
ordinating research in nanotechnology and an allied
network in Russia; three R&D institutes were subordinated
to the Kurchatov Institute in 2009. 

Evaluation of R&D units’ performance
Efficient restructuring, coupled with improvements in the
way state-funded R&D institutions operate, requires
comprehensive tools for performance evaluation. Such
instruments are widely used in many countries where they
have proven their worth. During the immediate post-
Soviet period in Russia, research evaluation exercises 
were mostly confined to the procedures followed by
government agencies and state foundations when
deciding which competing R&D projects to finance; the
actual output of R&D institutions was not evaluated. 
This situation caused R&D spending from the federal
budget to spiral upwards between 1998 and 2008.
Spending tripled, even as the growth rate of certain
output indicators fell below zero. To reverse the trend, 
a government policy statement was adopted in 2008,
entitled On the System of Performance Evaluation for Civil
R&D Organizations. Its main goals are to establish
procedures and criteria for regular performance
assessments of government R&D organizations and to
optimize their network. The policy calls for a statistical
survey to be conducted every five years, combined with

Box 3: Modernizing Russia’s Academies of Science 

The Russian network of state
academies includes the Russian
Academy of Sciences and the five
academies for agriculture, medicine,
architecture and construction,
education and arts. Together, these
academies control 865 research
institutes which employed a total of
137 500 R&D personnel in all
occupational categories in 2008. 
Over two-thirds of R&D personnel are
employed by the Russian Academy of
Science’s 468 institutes. 

The most unusual feature of the

academies` legal status is their ‘mixed’
nature, combining elements of a

government institution, public
association and corporation. In reality,
academies act as holdings, ‘owning’
non-profit organizations. As
government institutions, the
academies are responsible for
managing, controlling, creating and
closing these organizations. 

The most worrying issue is the

mismatch between, on the one hand,
the amount of public resources spent
on funding research and running costs
like maintenance of the academies’
premises and, on the other hand, the
performance of the academies in
terms of R&D output. 

In 2005, a programme was adopted

to modernize the structure, functions
and funding mechanisms of the state
academies of science. The aim was to
streamline the network of institutes
governed by the academies. Some
which did not meet quality standards
were to be closed, staff numbers were
to be reduced and salaries increased.
Also envisaged was the reorganization
of the way in which R&D was
conducted to improve efficiency. This
programme was supposed to be fully
implemented by 2008 but had still not
been completed in early 2010.

reviews by evaluation commissions involving major
interest groups, such as government agencies, 
businesses, academia, the scientific community and
nongovernmental organizations. 

Evaluation criteria are based on the relationship between
input and output. At the end of the evaluation process,
every R&D organization will be assigned to one of three
performance groups: the leaders, middle-runners or
outsiders. Subsequent recommendations can then vary
from closure for outsiders to earmarked support for leaders. 

A better legal framework for IPRs and the
commercial ization of new technologies 
In recent years, the government has made a determined
effort to promote the market for intellectual assets in Russia
and develop a national system for registering and controlling
publicly funded research projects. It has also created a single
legal and organizational tool addressing intellectual property
rights (IPRs) generated at the expense of the federal budget.
The idea is to involve them in the economic turnover more
widely and effectively than before.

In 2005, the government adopted two resolutions to improve
the efficiency of intellectual property protection and promote
lawful business transactions, co-ordinate the activities of
partner agencies and strike a balance between the interests
of all stakeholders. These are entitled On the Procedure for
Disposing of Rights to the Results of S&T Activity and On
Government Registration of the Results of Civil-Purpose R&D.

Subsequently, the government focused on developing 
and enforcing legislation to regulate the commercialization
of technologies and protect related rights. In 2006, the
Parliament adopted a new Part IV of the Civil Code which
was designed to regulate intellectual activities in Russia.
Two years later, the Law on the Transfer of Rights to
Integrated Technology was adopted. This law aims for a
multiple use of IPRs due to greater patenting and licensing
activities. IPRs created at the expense of the federal budget
will be transferred to market actors on the basis of open
competition. This will allow public R&D organizations and
universities to sell technologies developed under
government-funded contracts to companies which, in
exchange, will be obliged to commercialize these
technologies. Subsequently, most publicly financed IPRs
will not remain in state possession out of the reach of
industrial demand but rather will enter into market
transactions.

228

The ultimate objective of these and other laws and
regulations is to improve the economic, legal and
organizational framework for the commercialization of
technologies to generate income from this activity and
make the national R&D sector more competitive. Another
important objective is to harmonize national legislation with
the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual
Property Rights (TRIPS), in order for Russia to meet the
requirements for joining the World Trade Organization.

Promoting public– private partnerships 
Faced with the low demand for innovation and an
insufficient influx of private investment into high-tech
industries, the government decided to set up the Russian
Venture Company (RVC) in 2006. This move was
complemented by the founding of sector-specific state
corporations, such as Rosnano (nanotechnologies),
Rosatom (nuclear energy) and Rosteknologii (Russian
Technologies) in 2007 and 2008. 

The role of the RVC is to promote the investment of venture
capital and other forms of financial support for S&T
countrywide. Resources for its capitalization are allocated
from the Investment Fund of the Russian Federation. 
The RVC then invests in regional and sectoral venture
companies. The financial role of the sector-specific state
corporations is to ensure that resources are concentrated in
areas of national interest. As a rule, these corporations are
established by special federal laws that determine their
legislative framework, goals and organizational principles.
For example, Rosnano is specifically dealing with the
growing challenges posed by the rapid development of
new nanotechnologies. Its key objectives include the
commercialization of nanotechnology, investment in
nanotechnology-related new businesses and infrastructure
and the development of professional training in this field
(Gokhberg et al., 2009a; HSE/IWEIR, 2008).

Tax incentives for strengthening R&D 
and innovation 
After much debate, several new regulations for reducing
the tax burden on R&D and innovation were adopted in
2007, followed by tax breaks established by the latest
changes to the Tax Code taking effect in 2008. The most
important novelties include new rules for calculating
value-added tax (VAT), a tax on profits, and an overall
simplification of the taxation system. For example, profits
generated by selling or licensing IPRs are now exempt
from VAT. A list of tax-exempt services that support the

development of new or improved products was also
approved. Regarding the taxing of profits, the list of R&D-
sponsoring foundations whose goal-oriented funding
does not have to be included in the calculation of the
taxation base at R&D organizations has been lengthened.
In addition, more favourable accelerated depreciation
conditions have been introduced for R&D fixed assets. 

These innovation–friendly taxation instruments will help to
create a more favourable climate for innovation. In order to
encourage business investment strategies to promote R&D
and innovation further, a new round of tax legislation
initiatives was launched recently. For example, in 2009, the
government introduced tax benefits for entities investing in
R&D and priority S&T areas, such as bio- and nano technology,
nuclear energy and new types of transport system. The next
round of favourable tax novelties will take effect in 2010,
with a particular emphasis on easing conditions for
compulsory social security payments for employees of
companies whose main economic activities are ICT
development, engineering and R&D; and tax breaks for
profits generated by medical and educational services. 
It is planned to simplify the procedure for customs
registration of imports of high-tech equipment and
materials, as well as to introduce financial guarantees for
exports of high-tech products.

Improved infrastructure for innovation
Infrastructure for technology commercialization and
transfer makes up an important part of Russia’s national
innovation system. This infrastructure includes 
66 technology transfer centres, 84 technoparks, 
174 innovation and technology centres, and 81 business
incubators. In most cases, these are associated with
research institutes or universities (HSE, 2008b).

Government schemes to strengthen infrastructure
promoting innovation have primarily been concentrated
in three areas:

Technoparks
There are dozens of technoparks in Russia, although
technopark policies are fraught with problems due to
multiple ‘white spots’ in the legislation that dramatically
weaken the capabilities of universities and R&D
institutions to commercialize new technologies. On
account of their legal status, state universities and
government R&D institutions have limited rights when it
comes to creating or directly supporting innovative small

Russian Federation

and medium-sized enterprises; in particular, they are not
allowed to provide any funding or facilities for start-ups2.
That is why Russian technoparks either do not function
autonomously but rather as part of a ‘host organization’, or
do not engage in innovation at all, merely leasing the
premises and facilities to others. 

To make better use of technoparks, the government is
considering the following options: providing technoparks
with federal land on a competitive basis, both for
purchase and long-term leasing; direct investment in
technopark infrastructure by government agencies and
publicly sponsored venture companies; and sharing costs
between federal and regional authorities. 

Special economic zones
These were introduced in Russia in 2005 in order to
provide a favourable regime for innovative entrepreneur -
ship in certain areas of S&T. Particular locations were
identified specifically to encourage the development of
new high-tech businesses. Special economic zones can be
found in Saint Petersburg, Dubna, Zelenograd, Tomsk and
elsewhere. 

Science cities
The concept of science cities follows the Soviet-era
tradition of urban settlements specialized in S&T. At one
time, about 70 municipalities were ranked as science
cities, 29 of which were located in the Moscow region.
During the 1990s, their heavy reliance on S&T activities
resulted in economic and social hardship. In a new
approach, the government is determining priorities for
each city and a state programme for S&T development,
with specific forms of federal support. Science city
funding, along with assistance with logistics and
maintenance, is provided by the federal budget, by the
budgets of regional and local authorities, and by other
funding sources. Once science city status for 25 years is
confirmed by the President of the Russian Federation, this
decision serves as a catalyst for the allocation of additional
federal funding on a competitive basis for the
implementation of innovation projects. In addition, more
efficient mechanisms for transferring federal funds to local
innovation-related initiatives are to be introduced in
2010–2011 through amendments to existing legislation. 

2. A special law to eliminate these barriers was adopted in 2009 and further
legislative initiatives in this direction are in the pipeline.

UNESCO SCIENCE REPORT 2010

INTERNATIONAL CO-OPERATION 
IN S&T
In order to facilitate its integration in the global S&T arena
and assume a greater role, Russia has been stepping up its
efforts to develop international co-operation. A crucial
aspect of this co-operation are the ties with the EU,
international organizations and regional economic
associations. 

The Agreement on Co-operation in Science and Technology
between the European Community and the Government of the
Russian Federation was adopted in 1999. Although this
formally expired in 2007, both sides have agreed to prolong
its validity until a new accord can be signed. A road map for
setting up the EU–Russia Common Space of Education and
Science has been developed jointly with the European
Commission on the basis of the principles of equality and
partnership, taking into account the mutual interests of
both parties. At the same time, the EU and Russia are
strengthening the co-ordination of their priorities for S&T
and innovation in areas that include new materials,
nanotechnology, non-nuclear energy production, ICTs and
biotechnology in fields such as food and health. These
efforts have already yielded a growing number of joint
initiatives, including co-ordinated calls, for project
proposals. Thus, for the EU’s Sixth Framework Programme
for Research and Technological Development (2002–2006),
Russia ranked first among participating third parties, both
in terms of the number of projects implemented with
European partners and the amount of funding obtained
from the EU (European Commission, 2009). Moreover,
bilateral discussions regarding Russia’s association with the
EU Framework Programme started in 2008–2009.

Strategic importance is also attached to contacts with the
European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
(OECD) and other international bodies. Apart from the
obvious benefits associated with access to modern
multilateral programmes and facilities, participation in
international projects allows Russian companies to secure
large-scale orders. Other projects make it possible for
Russia to adapt and adopt efficient instruments for
promoting S&T and innovation. These instruments include
various forms of public–private partnership, technology
foresight exercises, cross-country co-operation and
technology transfer, and support for small and medium-
sized enterprises. 

230

In addition, Russia continues to participate in most of the
international projects and alliances involving space
research, including the International Space Station in low
orbit above the Earth3 and the ‘Sea Launch’.4 These
partnerships are supported by the Russian Space Agency,
which considers them an essential element for
implementing the national space programme. Russia is
also an active participant in the International Committee
on Space Research (COSPAR) and the United Nations’
Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS). 

Within the framework of international S&T co-operation,
many joint laboratories, research, education and
innovation alliances and partnerships have been
established. Examples include joint laboratories organized
with the participation of Russian research centres and
universities together with the Dutch Organisation for
Applied Research (TNO), CNRS (France), Industrial
Technology Research Institute (Chinese Taipei), partner
organizations from the Republic of Korea, etc., in
chemistry, biology, nanotechnology and other S&T fields. 
In addition, legal and organizational tools for co-operation
at both intergovernmental and interdepartmental levels
have been improved. It is even more promising that a
growing volume of commercial contracts and agreements
are being concluded in the S&T sector with other countries
and that an increasing number of joint ventures are being
set up in Russia. Thus, the joint–stock enterprise Alcatel-
Lucent RT established by the respective French company
and state corporation Russian Technologies is starting to
invest in 2010 in the development, manufacturing and
marketing of telecommunications equipment for the
Russian market and those of the countries of the
Commonwealth of Independent States5. Rosnano and its
Italian partner company Galileo Vacuum Systems is
launching a new company to produce Radio Frequency
Identification (RFID) labels at manufacturing units located

3. The assembly of the International Space Station is expected to be
completed by 2011. The project involves the American National
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), Canadian Space Agency
(CSA), European Space Agency (ESA), Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency
(JAXA) and Russian Federal Space Agency (RKA). 

4. Sea Launch is a unique, mobile platform from which spacecraft can be
launched and rockets fired at sea from an optimum position on the Earth’s
surface. It involves a consortium of four companies from Norway, Russia,
Ukraine and the USA.

5. The CIS consists of nine former Soviet republics. See Annex I for the list of
CIS countries.

in Russia, Italy and Serbia. The Russian side will contribute
49% of the requisite investment and the company will be a
proprietor of any technologies that are developed.
Meanwhile, the jointly owned US–Russian company
IsomedAlpha has begun production of high-tech medical
equipment like computer tomographs. 

These international partnerships are making it possible to
increase exports of high-tech products and services in
certain areas. For example, in 2005–2007, exports of
Russian ICT products doubled and those of electronic
equipment, aircraft and spaceships grew by 40–50%
(HSE/IWEIR, 2008; HSE, 2009c, p.65).

CONCLUSION 

As 2010 gets under way, Russia, like other nations, is in the
throes of a highly complex global economic recession.
Owing to its national peculiarities, the country not only
enjoys certain advantages – primarily, its huge resource
potential and substantial financial reserves – but also
faces great challenges in its efforts to recover from the
economic recession. The need to innovate in response to
the crisis is obvious and is confirmed by the fact that most
industrial nations are implementing economic recovery
packages. These programmes normally focus on
improving macro-economic parameters and on ensuring
national competitiveness in the post-crisis period. To this
end, the recovery packages of these countries envisage
measures for supporting promising areas of S&T, as well 
as indirect incentives for innovating companies. 

The Russian government today favours the same approach.
Anti-crisis measures that are clearly innovation-oriented,
along with other initiatives, are placing considerable
demands on the R&D sector. This requires prompt
intervention to move institutional reforms forward in order
to overcome the lack of co-ordination at the departmental
level, lower persisting administrative barriers between
science, education and industry, and increase the efficiency
of R&D organizations. This should lead ultimately to the
concentration of resources in the centres of excellence
created in leading research institutes and universities. 
These centres of excellence should be able to ensure the
delivery of cutting-edge achievements in basic science, 
as well as applied results and technology that can meet
growing demand from the national economy. This should
be accompanied by additional policy measures to provide

Russian Federation

greater opportunities for public research bodies and
universities to participate in innovation, facilitate academic
mobility and radically modernize the professional training
of scientists and engineers.

At the end of the day – recession or not – Russia will have
no choice but to improve substantially the efficiency of its
national S&T sector and innovation policies. All the
necessary transformation processes have undoubtedly
been set in motion but they call for a stronger focus on
the part of all stakeholders; direct and indirect systemic
support from the government; forward-looking
innovation-based company strategies; and for monitoring
of both the steps taken and their impact.

INTRODUCTION

Central Asia covers a vast territory consisting of deserts,
steppes and mountains. Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan,
Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan are all primarily
agrarian economies: about 70% of the total surface area
(418 million hectares) is classified as agricultural land.
In theory, 15 % of agricultural land is irrigated but the true
figure is closer to 3%. The contribution of the agriculture
sector to the national economy varies from 31% in
Kyrgyzstan to just 6% in Kazakhstan (Figure 1).

The region has one of the most varied plant collections in
the world: fruit, nuts, grains and beans but also wild
relatives and ancestors of food crops which are of
regional and global importance. The intensification of
grain crop production and overgrazing are threatening
the region, however, with the loss of local varieties and
wild relatives of cultivated plants. The fact that all five
countries have ratified or otherwise endorsed several
international agreements1 over the past 15 years related
to environmental protection and the conservation of
genetic resources offers governments a policy framework
for tackling problems of global importance, such as

climate change, desertification and loss of biological
diversity. 

Central Asia has so far escaped largely unscathed from the
global economic recession. Unlike many post-Soviet countries
which are experiencing a sharp recession, including giants
Russia and Ukraine, the economies of the five Central Asian
countries studied here are holding their own, even if it is too
early for this to be reflected in the data (Table 1). 

All but Turkmenistan belong to the Commonwealth of
Independent States (CIS), a loose association of nine former
Soviet republics2. The Eurasian Economic Community
(EAEC) is increasingly appearing as a more unifying body,
especially as several countries have withdrawn from the 
CIS in recent years, including Georgia in 2008. The EAEC
originated from a customs agreement between Belarus, the
Russian Federation and Kazakhstan in 1996 and was joined
by Tajikistan four years later. In 2010, the EAEC was working
towards establishing a common energy market and
exploring ways to use water more efficiently in Central Asia.
More than a purely economic association, the EAEC offers

R&D INPUT

R&D expenditure remains low
R&D funding has remained low over the past decade in
all five republics and throughout Central Asia. No
country in the region devoted more than 0.25% of GDP
to gross domestic expenditure on R&D (GERD) in 2007
(Table 2). 

In the five countries under study, R&D is conducted
by 836 organizations in total (Table 3). On average,
21.5% of GERD is invested by universities and 
other institutions of higher learning. Government
laboratories account for much of the remainder
(62.6%). The role of the private sector varies
considerably from one country to another. In
Kazakhstan, business contributes 45% of GERD,
compared to just 2% in Tajikistan (Figure 2). Data on
R&D is unfortunately unavailable for Turkmenistan.

The ‘Soviet generation’ is nearing retirement
The five countries under study can boast of good
institutional infrastructure, a solid legislative base and
qualified experts inherited from the Soviet era, assets that
provide a solid foundation for the development of S&T.
Two-thirds of R&D is conducted by government institutes
(64.5%) [Figure 3]. 

It is Uzbekistan which counts the greatest number of
researchers per million population (Table 4). At 954, this
ratio is close to the world average of 1 081 and is higher
than the average for CIS countries in Asia as a whole (526)
[see page 8]. 

The low numbers of research personnel should be a
policy concern for many Central Asian countries, all the
more so in light of the ageing R&D personnel. In
Kazakhstan, 13% of Doctors of Science are more than
60 years old, compared to 11% in Tajikistan and
Uzbekistan. The proportion is even higher in Tajikistan for

holders of a Candidate of Science3 degree: 20% (Table 5).
The problem will become more acute when the ‘Soviet
generation’ retires in 2012–2015. It should thus be
attracting greater attention in government policy circles.

Moreover, among the up and coming generation, the
proportion of students studying for a Candidate of Science
degree is much lower than the proportion of those studying
for a Doctor of Science degree, a situation reversed in the case
of researchers. This suggests that the number of scientists
with a high level of specialization will decline in coming years.  

To make matters worse, rare are those who successfully
defend their thesis. On average, just 8% of candidates
obtain their Candidate of Science degree in Kazakhstan,
22% in Uzbekistan and 15% in Tajikistan. The main reason
for student’s low success rate lies in the inadequate

government funding for postdoctoral research.
Furthermore, the subject of student theses, which tend to
be confined to basic research, rarely corresponds to
government priorities. A third explanation can be found in
the falling prestige of researchers in a society where the
market now wields considerable influence.

COUNTRY PROFILES
Kazakhstan 
Kazakhstan has a relatively good capacity for R&D, as
evidenced by the pool of qualified personnel and the 
1 169 patents accorded in 2009. Kazakh scientists
contributed 0.02% of articles to international journals in
2008, or one article per nine scientists, a figure close to the
global average. It is evident that, with greater government
support, Kazakh R&D could make a substantial
contribution to both GDP and world science. 

At present, Kazakhstan devotes just 0.21% of GDP to GERD,
a figure comparable to the R&D effort of other Central
Asian countries but well below the global average of 1.7%
(see page 2). A GERD/GDP ratio of 2% has been proposed
as the safety threshold for economic growth. With
investment levels being too low to cover the cost of R&D 
in Kazakhstan, scientists are at a disadvantage. The
government has fixed a number of targets for remedying
the situation within a strategic programme for an
Intellectual Nation – 2020 which is discussed overleaf.

Industry contributes more than one-third of GDP (Figure 1).
The main branches are mining, non-ferrous and ferrous
metallurgy, mechanical engineering, oil refining and
petrochemistry, as well as the production of building
materials. According to the national statistics agency,
in 2008, half (51%) of R&D funding was provided by the
government, 29% by customers of R&D services, 18% came
from the institute’s own funds and 1.7% from foreign
sources. One state enterprise that provides customer R&D

modern services, such as reference indexing and rating
systems for organizations and scientists. It has also extended
existing services like the analysis and commercialization of
research results, in addition to developing international 
co-operation. The aim of the portal is to make it easier for
the scientific community to access scientific, technical and
educational information by making it available via Internet.
The Internet has become one of the most popular media for
the exchange of information (Figure 4). In 2004, the centre
also developed a web portal in English, Russian and Kazakh
called All about Science in Kazakhstan.

An intellectual nation by 2020
Kazakhstan has not been impervious to the global
economic recession, a sign of the country’s integration in
the global economy. Like other countries, it has revised its
S&T policy in the wake of the recession. During a meeting
with students from the Balashik Intellectual School in
Astana in 2009, President Nazarbaev unveiled a
programme for the coming decade entitled Intellectual
Nation – 2020. It has three main thrusts:

■ There are currently ‘intellectual schools’ known as

Balashik in the cities of Astana and Semipalatinsk. By
2011, it is planned to open similar schools in every part of
the country. The objective is to spot talented children,
identify their specific gift then begin targeted training to
nurture it. The curriculum of these schools will emphasize
exact and natural sciences and the development of
critical and creative thinking. Together with a new
international university in Astana, these Balashik are the
main elements of a new approach designed to bring the
national education system up to international standards. 

■ On the premise that science should be the basis of an
innovative economy, there will be a drive to push up
government and private-sector funding of R&D. In the past
five years, funding for science has almost quadrupled. In
2009, it amounted to 18.5 billion tenge, or US$ 123 million.
GERD per capita came to US$ 23, by far the highest ratio in
Central Asia (Table 2). The government programme plans
to multiply investment in R&D tenfold to 2.5% of GDP by
2015. A second goal is to achieve parity of 45–50% for
government and private-sector funding of R&D by 2012.
Foreign sources will account for the remainder. 

■ The third thrust is the development of a national

innovation system. Innovation is always a meeting of
ideas and business. Such an encounter results in tangible

240

growth in goods manufacturing and a sharp increase in
profits and competitiveness. Following the adoption of a
Law on State Support for Innovative Activity in March
2006, the president instructed the government to
stimulate innovation through such measures as the
creation of a complex system of technology and
knowledge transfer; an innovation monitoring system
and the development of infrastructure to foster
innovation, including the construction of an Information
Technology Park in Almaty and the creation of regional
technoparks and industrial zones. 

The Intellectual Nation – 2020 programme sets out four
priority areas for R&D:

■ Biotechnologies and biochemistry: with a focus on

improving food safety and strengthening the human
immune system;

■ Ecoenergy: in the form of renewable energy sources, ‘green
power’, solar energy, superconductors and the capture and
storage of light with low energy consumption;

■ Ecology: the development of technologies to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions and of a water treatment
system permitting rapid recognition of various
biosubstances, to be coupled with the introduction of
biodecomposed plastics and the identification of bacteria
capable of destroying sources of environmental pollution;

■ Anti-ageing: research into extending life expectancy

and rejuvenation.

Technoparks to foster innovation
The focus of R&D has changed little over the past decade.
The modest share of research devoted to experimental
development (25%) means that high-tech products
developed in Kazakhstan do not always get as far as the
marketplace (Figure 5). As was noted during an international
conference on Science and Time Challenges in Almaty in
November 2008, scientific personnel basically focus little on
the innovation component of scientific endeavour, as they
tend not to have adapted yet to the market economy. 

Moreover, there are no professional training programmes for
the management of innovation activity, nor any monitoring
of available and potential consumers. To compound matters,
there is a lack of staff qualified to orient the economy
towards innovation. There is also a penury of university

teachers with knowledge of how to use modern
technologies in project management or any familiarity with
the principles and techniques of training specialists in fields
related to innovation. Kazakhstan does, however, train a fairly
large pool of economists, as economics (12.6%) is the
second-most popular specialization for Doctor of Science
candidates after medicine (17.1 %), just ahead of law (12.4 %). 

Kyrgyzstan
Kyrgyzstan has escaped largely unscathed from the global
recession. Professor Jumakadyr Akeneev, President of the
Kirghiz Investment Fund, has observed that Kyrgyzstan
recorded economic growth of 3% in 2009, at a time when
the economy of many countries – Kazakhstan, Russia and
Ukraine included – was stagnating. 

If Central Asia is to embrace the knowledge economy, it will
need to develop infrastructure to foster innovation. The
most effective model for integrating science, education and
production processes establishes linkages between the
research team and the consumer of the finished product or,
in other words, between the scientific idea and its practical
application. Infrastructure for innovation typically consists of
a network of business incubators and technoparks. In
Kazakhstan, there are already several technoparks in
existence: in Karaganda (UniScienTech Technopark), Uralsk
(Algorithm Technopark) and Almaty (Alatau ITCity National
technopark, Almaty Regional Technopark and KazNTU
Technopark at the Kazakh National Technical University,
named after Academician K. I. Satpaev). The majority of
these technoparks are still start-ups. Their activity tends to
be confined to the development of small businesses in
various fields.

Over the past five years, Kyrgyzstan has enjoyed
considerable economic growth, with GDP peaking at 
US$ 5 billion in 2009. This prowess needs to be relativised,
however: prior to independence in 1991, Kyrgyzstan
generated GDP of US$ 13 billion. 

In 2010, Kyrgyzstan plans to increase repayments on the
foreign debt in excess of US$2 billion accumulated under
the republic’s first President Askar Akaev (1991–2005), the
possibilities for restructuring the country’s debt having
been almost exhausted. Under such a scenario, the
prospects for Kyrgyzstan’s economic and scientific
development appear more sombre than in either
Kazakhstan or Uzbekistan. Moreover, at the time of
writing in late April 2010, President Kurmanbek Bakiyev
had just been forced to resign and the country was in the
hands of a transition government led by former foreign

minister Roza Otunbayeva. The political situation in
Kyrgyzstan was thus somewhat uncertain.

The republic does have some S&T capacity, even if the
number of researchers per million population is relatively
low (Table 4). The government has also introduced a
programme entitled 21st Century Personnel to improve
the quality of education.

Building a system for information exchange 
In November 2005, former President Bakiyev published a
Decree on the Optimization of the Structure of State
Bodies of Kyrgyzstan. This decree abolished Kyrgyzpatent,
the centre for S&T information, and transferred its
functions to the Department of Science, Innovation and
Scientific and Technical Information under the Ministry of
Education and Science. The objectives of this department
are to: 

I participate in the formulation and implementation of

state policy and government programmes in the
sphere of scientific, technical and economic
information; 

I gather, process, store, analyse and distribute S&T

information; 

I participate in the creation and development of a

national system of scientific, technical and economic
information-gathering of national importance, which
will then be stored in a database of the Ministry of
Education and Science; 

I gather S&T information using domestic and foreign

sources; 

I provide interested state bodies, organizations and

individuals with reference works and analytical
information related to S&T;

I organize and co-ordinate international co-operation

and the exchange of S&T information with other
countries within the bounds of legal agreements.

The key to accelerating S&T progress in Kyrgyzstan will be
the creation of a national system capable of supplying
information to the actors of economic development and
scientific progress. It is the Ministry of Education and
Science which is responsible for elaborating state policy in
the field of S&T information. The ministry is one of the
bodies implementing the state Programme for the
Development of Education and a Scientific and Technical
Information System in Kyrgyzstan for 2004–2010. Within
this role, the ministry develops co-operation and the

242

exchange of S&T information with branch research
institutes, institutions of higher education, academic
institutes and other ministries and agencies. 

The Ministry of Education and Science has concluded a
number of international agreements and contracts for the
exchange of S&T information. It also participates in
bilateral co-operation with scientific institutes abroad,
such as with the JSC Centre for Scientific and Technical
Information in Kazakhstan, mentioned earlier, UkrInTeI in
Ukraine and the All-Russian Institute of Scientific and
Technical Information under the Russian Academy of
Sciences. This is a step in the right direction but both the
Department of Science, Innovation and Scientific and
Technical Information and the Ministry of Education and
Science will need to expand their international
partnerships to include a greater number of international
centres responsible for S&T information in Central Asia.
Of note is that Kyrgyzstan is a member of the CIS
Interstate Co-ordination Council for Scientific and
Technical Information. 

Thanks to a scientific project for the Organization and 
Co-ordination of International Co-operation and the
Exchange of Scientific and Technical Information, a
‘unique window’ is being developed which will allow
researchers to use information and communication
technologies (ICTs) in various branches of science and
innovation. 

Adapting the economy to market needs
The Ministry of Education and Science is confronted 
with a second urgent challenge: that of preserving the
country’s S&T capacity and adapting it to market needs.
In 2009, the ministry involved students in a project to
create databases for the storage of degree theses. The
ministry is also reforming the competitive funding of
research programmes to ensure that the bidding process
encourages projects that favour socio-economic
development. 

The government needs to do more to foster innovation.
It should stimulate the influx of foreign and private capital
for innovation by proposing such policies as participation
funding, state guarantees, project insurance, tax
incentives for the private sector and the creation of patent
and innovation funds. The adoption of measures to foster
innovation is of strategic importance not only for
Kyrgyzstan but also for other Central Asian countries. 

Central Asia chapter [11] [P3]:Layout 1  18/10/10  19:05  Page 243

Tajikistan
In Tajikistan, the higher education sector employs more
than half of the country’s researchers (3 883 out of 5 617),
followed by the Academy of Sciences (706), the Ministry of
Public Health (380) and the Tajik Academy of Agricultural
Sciences (352). Women make up 13% of Doctors of
Science and 29% of Candidates of Science. The number 
of Candidates of Science among those younger than 
35 years leapt from 173 to 445 between 2005 and 2007,
even though overall numbers of researchers will decline in
Tajikistan in the coming years, as the older generation
approaches retirement. Although the spurt in the number
of young Candidates of Science is an encouraging sign, it
is not the only indicator of the level of efficiency of the
country’s research network. 

The level of investment in R&D is another indicator. If we
examine the state of scientific equipment and facilities,
such as experimental stations or botanical gardens, it
emerges that, of the 67 organizations carrying out R&D in
Tajikistan, just 16 concentrate most of the budget for
scientific equipment and machinery. Generally speaking,
material and technical support for science is sorely
inadequate and most scientific equipment is obsolete.
Those scientific organizations that do receive new
equipment owe their good fortune primarily to grants
from international bodies. Tajikistan devotes just 0.06% of
GDP to R&D, the weakest effort in all of Central Asia.
Yet, incredibly, the level of R&D funding was 16 times
higher in 2007 than in 2000. 

The government considers basic research a priority for
R&D funding. Basic research accounted for half of GERD in
2007 and experimental development for one-third
(Figure 5). The government has adopted a number of laws
to protect intellectual property in recent years. In February
2004, two laws were passed On Invention and On
Industrial Samples respectively. These were followed in
December 2006 by a Law on Rights Protection for the
Topology of Integrated Microcircuits then, in March 2007,
by a Law on trademarks and Service Marks and a second
Law on Geographical Indicators. 

Much of the R&D conducted by Tajik scientists finds practical
applications in the major branches of the national economy,
such as agriculture, construction, metallurgy, the chemical
industry, water-power engineering, computer facilities,
geology and public health services. As a result, Tajik
scientists have succeeded in recent years in developing new

materials, industrial objects and medicines, in furthering risk
prevention for earthquake hazards and in improving dam
construction to increase agricultural productivity. 

In the analytical compendium of the National Patent
Information Centre, which is the structural division of the
Ministry of Economic Development and Trade, there are
unfortunately no data available on the articles published
by Tajik scientists in reviewed international journals.
Bearing in mind that many Tajik scientists are not proficient
in English, the data available in Thomson Reuters’
Science Citation Index give only some indication of the
productivity of Tajik scientists (see Annex II, Tables 5 and 6).

Conscious of the need to prepare the next generation of
R&D personnel to take over from their ageing peers,
President Rakhmon declared 2010 the Year of Education
and Technical Knowledge. The government plans to
double the value of scholarships for talented students

from state schools and universities. Moreover, at the
president’s initiative, it is planned to open a presidential
lycée in 2011 for 1 000 pupils. 

Developing international S&T co-operation
In many respects, the scientific future of Tajikistan will
depend on how fast it can build the necessary infrastructure
to take its rightful place in world science. The government
has effectively recognized this fact in the strategy for S&T
adopted for 2007–2015. In the strategy, science appears as a
national priority and is described as being vital for progress
and a better quality of life. The strategy outlines an ambitious
programme for developing scientific co-operation with other
countries, including fellow members of the CIS, as well as
with international organizations, via intergovernmental
agreements and partnerships to be concluded by the
Academy of Sciences, research institutes and universities. 

There are good prospects for expanding multilateral
scientific co-operation via such bodies as the International
Association of Academies of Sciences, the Association of
Academies of Sciences of Central Asian Countries, the
Academy of Sciences for the Developing World (TWAS)
and the standing Committee on Scientific and
Technological Cooperation of the Organization of the
Islamic Conference. 

Lately, the opportunities for professional training or joint
research projects with scientists abroad have grown
considerably for Tajik scientists. Nevertheless, the level of
international scientific co-operation remains modest: 
in 2010, just 15 research projects were funded by
international grants and there were only nine joint projects. 

Turkmenistan
About 86% of Turkmenistan’s territory is covered by the
Karakum desert. Only in the southwest are there low
mountains known as the Kopet Dag. Turkmenistan shares
the Amu Darya River with Uzbekistan and can count on
the Karakum Canal for freshwater; the canal stretches
more than 1000 km from the upper course of the Amu
Darya River to Ashkhabad, the capital.  

Despite being largely desert, Turkmenistan is not without
natural resources. It possesses about one-third of the
world’s reserves of natural gas: up to 24 billion m3. It is also
blessed with considerable oil reserves of 7–12 billion tons
and has substantial deposits of potassium and the world’s
largest reserves of natural salt deposits. 

244

The potential for solar and wind energy is inexhaustible.
‘In Turkmenistan, solar panels generate 1682–1890 kW/
hour per m2 every year’, observed Professor Luis Lemkov
Zetterling in June 2009. The Director of the Scientific
Institute for Environment and Technologies of the
Independent Unviersity of Barcelona in Spain was
speaking at an international conference in Ashkhabad
on The Scientific Basis for the Introduction of new
Technologies during the Epoch of New Revival.
Professor Lemkov Zetterling (2009) observed that
Turkmenistan enjoyed 2 768–3 081 hours of sunlight
each year and affirmed that ‘all electric power
developed at present can be produced by means of
solar batteries’.

A new epoch for science in Turkmenistan
After the disintegration of the Soviet Union, Turkmen
science encountered great difficulties under the
presidency of Saparmurad Niyazov. By the year 2000,
more than 250 000 Russian-speaking Turkmen had left
the country. Among them were many well-known
researchers and other skilled experts. The Academy of
Sciences of Turkmenistan was closed down and many
research institutes ceased to exist. 

With the election of President Gurbanguly
Berdymuhamedov in February 2007, science in the
republic has revived again. At a meeting of cabinet
ministers on 12 June 2009, the President stated that
‘today, during this epoch of new revival, we shall raise
science to a level worthy of the intrinsic scientific value
and wisdom of our ancestors’. He also said that science
should aim to solve key problems facing the country and
society and become the foundation for national well-
being. Innovation, he said, should be the prerequisite for
Turkmenistan’s successful integration in the world of ideas
and high technologies. The same day, he declared 12 June
National Science Day and issued a decree reinstating the
Academy of Sciences (Nazakov, 2009a). 

The academy consists of 11 research institutes, including
six new open institutes. It is responsible for co-ordinating
and organizing science in Turkmenistan. It is also
entrusted with the vital task of translating the president’s
decree into reality: the development of a system for
managing science capable of accompanying the
modernization of the Turkmen economy. Highly skilled
managers will be a prerequisite for the creation of
infrastructure for science and innovation. 

Central Asia chapter [11] [P3]:Layout 1  18/10/10  19:05  Page 245

As of January 2010, the country counted 29 research
institutes and 16 institutions of higher education.
The president has determined the following priority
areas for R&D in the coming years: 

I extraction and refining of oil and gas and mining of

other minerals; 

I development of the electric power industry, with

exploration of the potential use of alternative sources
of energy: sun, wind, geothermal and biogas; 

I seismology; 
I transportation;
I the development of ICTs; 
I automation of production; 
I conservation of the environment and, accordingly,

introduction of non-polluting technologies that do not
produce waste; 

I development of breeding techniques in the 

agriculture sector;

I medicine and pharmaceuticals; 
I natural sciences;
I humanities, including the study of the country’s

history, culture and folklore. 

Uzbekistan
Science in Uzbekistan has a long history, particularly  
in astronomy, mathematics, medicine and philosophy.
Uzbekistan is home to Ulugh Beg, for example, the 
only astronomer ever to rule a mighty state. It was       
Ulugh Beg who built the enormous observatory in
Samarkand in 1420. Even today, the country has the 
third-biggest pool of researchers among CIS countries
after the Russian Federation and Ukraine: 26 000. Just
under one in ten researchers (2 421) work for the
Academy of Sciences.

In August 2006, President Islam Karimov issued a 
decree On Measures for Improving Co-ordination and
Management for the Development of Science and
Technologies. The purpose of this decree is to strengthen
the role of science in the country’s socio-economic
development, to use progress in S&T to liberalize the
economy and to improve the quality of research and
technological innovation by creating a favourable
environment. One key measure has been the
establishment of a Committee for the Co-ordination 
of the Development of Science and Technology which
answers directly to the Cabinet of Ministers. The
committee’s main objectives are to: 

Central Asia

I select priority areas for R&D, taking into account the

political and socio-economic role of R&D and the
achievements of modern science; 

I co-ordinate the activities of research institutes and agencies,
design bureaux and institutions of higher education falling
under the umbrella of ministries and agencies, and the
activities of the Academy of Sciences in priority areas of R&D; 

I ensure that R&D objectives are achieved and elaborate

S&T programmes;

I oversee effective monitoring of the implementation of

S&T programmes and projects; 

I develop international co-operation in S&T of mutual

benefit.

On the basis of proposals by the Cabinet of Ministers of the
Republic of Karakalpakstan4 and other regions, by ministries,
agencies, economic bodies and the Academy of Sciences, 
the Committee for the Co-ordination of the Development 
of Science and Technology has selected seven priority areas
for R&D:

I Study of the legal, economic and social bases of

development of the democratic state and civil society,
and deepening of economic reforms; 

I Study of moral and historical processes and problems

related to the spiritual and cultural development of
society and curricular reform based on historical,
national and universal values; 

I Development of high technologies and methods for
prospecting and conducting mining operations and
deep-processing of mineral raw materials and secondary
resources; 

I More rational use and conservation of land, water

resources and biological diversity, and the creation of
agrotechnologies for crops and animals based on the
rational use of genetic resources and biotechnologies; 

I Development of high technologies and modern

methods in medicine, an improved system of public
health care and greater environmental security;

I Development of high technologies to produce a new

generation of cars, equipment and materials,
engineering tools and information technology to drive
the knowledge economy; 

I Study of problems related to the creation of an

information society, development of technologies for
the transfer, processing and protection of information
and the creation of software for design and
management.

Once the seven priority areas for R&D had been established,
scientific institutions and universities were invited to develop
17 broad research programmes for the period 2008–2018. In
parallel, the committee consulted the Academy of Sciences
and ministries and agencies responsible for economic
development on which system of competitive bidding to

adopt for the selection of research proposals submitted by
scientific institutions and universities in areas corresponding
to the seven national priorities for R&D. A first round of the
selection process took place in 2007 for projects in basic
research and a second round in 2008 for projects in applied
research and experimental development. Eight basic
research programmes consisting of 417 projects were
adopted for implementation during 2007–2011. A further 
17 programmes consisting of 591 projects in applied
research are being implemented during 2009–2011. Eight
programmes consisting of 172 projects in experimental
development were implemented in 2009 and 2010.

As the national budget for research is very low – just 0.20%
of GDP in 2010, according to estimates – government
funding of selected projects is complemented by foreign
and private investment representing of 25–30% of GERD. 

Box 1: The Big Solar Furnace

In 2007, the most powerful solar laser in
the world began operating in the Tian-
Shan mountains about 50 km from
Uzbekistan’s capital, Tashkent. Capable of
cutting through metal as if it were paper,
the laser is powered by a concave mirror
as tall as a 12-storey building that is the
world’s largest thickener of solar beams:
it can focus up to 1 million watts of solar
energy (see photo, page 234). Facing the
giant concave mirror are 62 other 
mirrors that refract solar beams, rotating
during the day to follow the Sun’s path
across the sky then sending the solar
beams they capt to the primary mirror. 
The heat generated can melt any 
known material: in the heart of the
‘furnace’, the temperature climbs to
3000°C. A specially developed 
computer programme prevents the
furnace from overheating.

This unique optical–mechanical

complex is known as the Big Solar
Furnace. Constructed in 1991, it is
operated by the Institute of Materials
Science at the Uzbek Academy of

Sciences, with the participation of the
Institute of Nuclear Physics. The
project has succeeded in its objective
of transforming solar energy – a clean
and inexhaustible source of energy –
into laser radiation. 

Solar lasers can be applied to a

wide spectrum of fields. The Institute
of Materials Science has an industrial
line for ceramics. Using the solar
furnace, materials are developed
which present unique physical and
chemical properties, such as limited
thermal expansion, high durability
and heat-resistance in extreme
environments, such as during a fire.
Multipurpose ceramics include
high-temperature heaters, fire-
resistant materials, transformers,
gas burners and radiators for
medicine. Other products include
thread drivers for the textile industry
and insulators for the electrical
power industry. Ceramic pontoons
are also produced for the oil and gas
industry. 

When you consider that lasers are

more efficient than cable lines, it is
only a small step to imagine them
being used one day for satellite
communications in space – and
perhaps even to send signals to
distant planets. 

Arguably the most exciting

potential for the solar laser lies in the
development of solar power stations
orbiting Earth, where the Sun’s
radiation is about twice as powerful
as on our planet. Such an experiment
would be extremely costly, however,
not to mention premature; the
technology for a solar power plant is
still being tested at the Big Solar
Furnace. The Uzbek team is co-
operating with Japanese scientists on
this project and hopes to identify
partners in other countries.

The quota for funding allocated to each research
programme is fixed by the committee together with the
Ministry of Finance. The state budget is assigned by the
Ministry of Finance directly to the ‘customers’ responsible
for each R&D programme or project. These customers may
be the Academy of Sciences, Ministry of Higher Education
and Secondary Specialized Education, Ministry of Public
Health, Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources,
Ministry of Public Education or other ministries, leading
research centres and other agencies and organizations. 

It is the committee which monitors implementation of
R&D programmes and projects. In 2006–2008, it reported
that R&D programmes and projects had led to the
obtention of 166 patents. Over this period, among articles
published in international journals, approximately the
same number concerned basic research as applied
research. Uzbek scientists contributed 0.19% of scientific
articles worldwide, compared to 0.02% for Kazakhstan.

Developing innovation infrastructure 
Throughout the republic, regional centres are being created
to foster technology transfer and innovation. Meanwhile,
the Ministry of Education has developed a curriculum for
the Training of Qualified Administrative Staff and Specialists
in Venture Funds and Company Rules (2008).

In July 2008, the President published a Decree on
Additional Measures for Stimulating the Introduction of
Innovation Projects and Technologies in Production. In
parallel, innovation fairs were held in Tashkent in April
2008, April 2009 and March 2010. Each fair produced a
catalogue of ideas, technologies and projects related to
innovation. These catalogues may be consulted on the
committee’s website. The innovation fairs produced 
1200 contracts with state enterprises for the development
of innovative products and processes. Fourteen state
enterprises have since started production of high-tech
products in the medical field, ICTs and the transformation
of local raw materials. Moreover, the market model
adopted by the government includes support for
intellectual property protection. This has given scientists
the chance to increase the volume of research results they
translate into products and processes from 8–10 % to 
27–30% without the need for additional government
capital investment. It should be noted, however, that,
although the innovation fairs have stimulated R&D, the
regional innovation centres remain at an embryonic stage
of development and still face many hurdles. 

Central Asia

CONCLUSION

In economically developed countries like France, Germany,
the UK and USA, the R&D infrastructure pools the efforts of a
wide spectrum of actors: the state, large industrial companies
and small private companies specializing in innovation, the
higher education sector and non-profit organizations. 
This experience should be analysed by Central Asian
countries interested in developing their own infrastructure. 

We have seen that, of the five Central Asian republics, it is
Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan which have the most
developed science systems. The woefully inadequate
funding levels for R&D is a problem common to all Central
Asian countries, however. All five need to make a
determined effort to attract non-governmental sources of
funding, especially from small and medium-sized
businesses and in the form of venture capital and foreign
direct investment. A second necessity is for countries to
make greater use of electronic means to enable
stakeholders to share STI information. 

Central Asian countries share a variety of other problems,
namely:

I the lack of an effective system of interaction between

actors of innovation;

I an inadequate supply of R&D personnel;
I insufficient innovation on the part of scientific

organizations and industrial enterprises;

I an inadequate legal basis for the development of

innovation;

I a lack of large international research projects oriented

towards solving regional problems such as
environmental degradation, the inadequate
conservation of plant genetic resources and food 
and environmental insecurity.

The five countries under study should take advantage of
the vast potential for international scientific co-operation
offered by their close political, historical and cultural ties.
It would be mutually advantageous for the scientific
communities of these countries to join forces to improve
environmental and food security in the region, conserve
and use natural resources sustainably and stabilize
national economies. This said, joint research programmes
will only be effective if they are backed by funding levels
sufficiently high to allow the region to realize its potential
and raise the population’s standard of living.

UNESCO SCIENCE REPORT 2010

Box 2: A blue dye to the rescue of the Aral Sea Basin

Both Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan
border the Aral Sea. The Uzbek part of
the Aral Sea shrank by 80% between
2006 and 2009, according to satellite
imagery provided by the European
Space Agency. The water situation in
Uzbekistan has become critical.
Intensive irrigation and drainage of
lands for agriculture over the past 
40 years have turned what was once
the fourth-largest lake in the world
into a salty, toxic desert where little
will grow. Even today, farmers still
depend upon cotton for their
livelihood, even though this thirsty
crop is ill-adapted to the region’s
ecosystem. 

Indigofera tinctoria is a natural
blue dye. Although the plant has
never before been grown in Central
Asia, it possesses properties that make
it a likely candidate for rehabilitating
the region’s salt-ridden soils. In 2006, a
team led by UNESCO Science Advisor
Professor Abdukodir Ergashev devised
a series of experiments within
UNESCO’s UzIndigo project to
determine how indigo would react to
saline, low-yield soils. The trials were

conducted on the experimental farm
of Urgench State University and led to
the development of a new cultivar of
indigo especially adapted to the harsh
local conditions, Feruz-1. The new
cultivar is able to grow in exceedingly
saline soils thanks to the combination
of highly developed bacteria in the
plant’s roots. 

In 2008, additional field

experiments were carried out in
collaboration with an association of
farmers in Bagat District to identify the
effect of various dosages of fertilizer
on the size of indigo plants. Although
the indigo plant fixes nitrogen in the
soil, it was discovered that the plant
would grow considerably taller if
mineral fertilizers were added. 

In 2009 and 2010, UNESCO’s

Tashkent office ran a series of training
workshops for farmers on growing
indigo. The workshops also attracted
teachers and scientists eager to learn
about the biotechnology of natural
dyes and how to improve soil
ecology. UNESCO used this
opportunity to provide farmers with
seeds of Feruz-1 to enable them to

conduct field tests on their own
properties. The main obstacle to
widespread cultivation of I. tinctoria is
the absence of seeds in Uzbekistan.
One option would be to establish the
country’s first farm specialized in seed
production then to share this
technology with Uzbek farmers.

From the outset, it was decided to
target both the local and international
markets for indigo dye from the region.
The European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development helped to identify
reliable markets in Europe, where it
transpired that 1 kg of indigo dye
could fetch up to €240. 

By 2010, natural indigo was well

on the way to being produced
commercially in the Aral Sea Basin.
Farmers were also being encouraged
to develop other alternative cash
crops to cotton, such as medicinal
plants, vegetables and fruit. The
project is also promoting water-
saving technologies of benefit not
only to agriculture but also to the
domestic and industrial sectors.

INTRODUCTION

The Arab world stretches from the Indian Ocean in the
East to the Atlantic Ocean in the West. Twenty Arab
countries occupy the southern and eastern shores of the
Mediterranean and border the Red Sea. 

It is an area of historical importance, as it is the birthplace
of the world’s three Abrahamic religions. For centuries, the
region was a hub of groundbreaking science. It is of
contemporary strategic importance owing to its location
and a wealth of subterranean natural resources, essentially
in the form of oil and natural gas – 32% of the world’s
known natural gas reserves are to be found in the region –
as well as phosphate: Morocco alone possesses more than
half of the world’s reserves.

The region encompasses remarkable cultural similarities as
well as highly distinct political and economic systems with a
heterogeneous social fabric. Its peoples share a commonality
of language, history and religion but their societies are at
variance in terms of natural wealth, governance, currency,
traditions and socio-economic systems.

The period since the UNESCO Science Report 2005
appeared has been one of mixed fortunes for Arab
countries. The region has witnessed continuing political
upheaval and military conflict in the Gaza Strip and the
West Bank, Iraq, Lebanon and Sudan. The oil-exporting
Arab states of Kuwait, the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, Qatar,
Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have enjoyed a
short-lived downpour of revenue resulting from the hike
in international oil prices to a peak of more than US$ 140 a
barrel in July 2008. Conversely, oil-importing countries
such as Jordan, Tunisia and Morocco have faced fiscal
difficulties due to their mounting national energy bills, a
situation compounded by the associated rise in the cost of
imported food commodities.

The subsequent plummet in oil prices, which fell to about
US$ 40 by the end of 2008 before recovering slightly in
2009, has brought this exceptional situation to an end. 
It has also highlighted the volatility of oil prices and the
need for Arab oil-exporting countries to diversify their
economies in future.

Notwithstanding these difficulties, the same period also
witnessed renewed interest on the part of many Arab
countries in reinvigorating science and technology (S&T)

and higher education, with the launch of a number of top-
down initiatives to support education and research. Some
of these will be highlighted in the present chapter. A
handful of countries have also approved plans to allocate
more resources to research and development (R&D),
among them Egypt, Tunisia and Qatar.

The current global economic recession may not affect
Arab states in the immediate term, as the banking sector
in the majority of Arab states is highly regulated and only
loosely linked to international money markets. However,
the economic fallout will ultimately be felt by all,
negatively affecting foreign direct investment flowing into
Arab countries and real estate markets. This will cause a
slowdown in economic growth and a rise in
unemployment in the region. Arab countries reliant on
exporting goods and services to the USA and European
Union (EU) and those that normally receive aid from these
quarters may suffer. Even before the economic recession
emerged in the last quarter of 2008, unemployment in the
Arab world was higher than in any other part of the world,
at around 12%. Young job-seekers constitute over 40% of
the region’s unemployed (UNESCWA, 2007). 

Despite the international economic uncertainty, Arab
states will have no choice but to stimulate science,
technology and innovation (STI), together with the
education sector, if only to overcome some lingering
problems like food, water and energy insecurity. Arab
countries can also learn from the remarkable socio-
economic progress of countries such as Brazil, China,
India, Malaysia and Mexico, due in part to S&T.

THE SOCIO-ECONOMIC SITUATION

Demography and economics
Arabs are young. Over 30% of the population of Arab
countries is less than 15 years of age (UNESCWA, 2007).
This is a double-edged sword for Arab decision-makers.
Young populations can stimulate growth and create
dynamic societies, particularly if they are well-trained and
well-educated. However, the inability of Arab
governments to provide the young with schooling or a
university education or to expand the productive capacity
to create a repository of jobs may well result in social
upheaval (UN/LAS, 2007). The World Bank estimates that
the region will have to create over 100 million jobs by
2020 to employ the young men and women joining the

employment market. Whereas the problem of
unemployment may prove to be insurmountable in some
of the poorer Arab countries like Yemen, it will be
manageable for those which count among the richest in
the world: Qatar, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates.

Countries of the Arab region may be grouped into three
categories in terms of per capita income. The first category
is characterized by almost total economic dependence on
oil: the Gulf States of Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi
Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, with GDP per capita
income being highest in Qatar (PPP US$ 65 182 in 2007)
and lowest in Oman (PPP US$ 22 695). Some 37 million
people belong to this group of countries, representing
around 11% of the Arab population (Figure 1). The STI and
higher education systems in these countries are new but
developing rapidly thanks to sizeable investments by their
heads of state and governments.

The second group encompasses Algeria, Egypt, Iraq,
Jordan, Lebanon, the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, Morocco, the

Palestinian Autonomous Territories, Syria and Tunisia. Here,
GDP per capita is highest in the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya at
US$ 7 773 and lowest in Egypt at US$ 1 505. Although the
countries in this category have modest oil reserves – with
the notable exception of Iraq and the Libyan Arab
Jamahiriya – they boast relatively mature higher education
infrastructure. This includes some of the oldest universities
in the Arab world, including Cairo University, the American
University of Beirut, Ezzitouna University in Tunisia and the
University of Al-Karaouine in Morocco. The population of
this group amounts to around 219 million, constituting
70% of the population in the Arab world. 

There is a distinct dichotomy between these two groups,
as countries belonging to the former have the material
and financial resources to carry out R&D but lack the solid
S&T and higher education systems to generate
knowledge. In the second group of countries, the
situation is reversed. Egypt, for example, is not wealthy
but is nevertheless considered a regional leader in terms
of S&T human resources and scientific publications.

The third group of countries is characterized by limited or
underdeveloped natural resources and an equally meagre
supply of trained human resources. Countries in this
category also possess some of the lowest GDP per capita
in the world, which classifies them as least developed
countries (LDCs). They are Comoros, Djibouti, Mauritania,
Sudan and Yemen. This group of countries represents
around 19% of the total population of the Arab world. The
proportion of those living below the national poverty line
rose by almost 10% in the Arab LDCs between 1990–1995
and 2000–2004, from 37% to 47% (UN/LAS, 2007). The
problems faced by Arab LDCs have been compounded by
internal political strife over the past 20 years.

As Figure 2 demonstrates, the level of human
development varies widely across the Arab world. Seven
countries – Bahrain, Kuwait, Libyan Arab Jamahiriya,
Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates –
have achieved high human development. GDP per capita
has risen steeply in all seven in recent years.

Between 2002 and 2007, the Arab region enjoyed average
economic growth of around 4% per annum. The bulk of
this growth was due to the hike in oil prices, although
other factors also contributed, such as economic
diversification, international free trade agreements and
the rapid development of the financial sector and other
services sectors, especially in the Gulf.

A key impediment to the region’s economic
development has been the lingering political conflicts in
Iraq, Lebanon, the Palestinian Autonomous Territories
and Sudan. These conflicts have erupted into violence
since the turn of the century. Acts of terrorism in Algeria,
Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia have exacerbated the
situation, causing many Arab countries to divert
resources towards security, military and defence budgets
at the expense of resources earmarked for development.
Figure 3 shows military expenditure in Arab countries as
a percentage of GDP, the highest ratio in the world, even
if it has declined in relative terms. Much of this spending
goes on the purchase of expensive armaments from
industrialized countries. The world’s top seven military
spenders per capita all come from the Middle East: Iraq,
Israel, Jordan, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Yemen 
(CIA, 2009). 

This phenomenon calls for serious review. Surely, the
introduction of security arrangements by the countries of

Arab States

the region and the resolution of political problems would
pave the way for a drop in defence spending, thereby
freeing up resources for development.

Governance
Governance in the majority of Arab countries is in a state
of turmoil. Arab regimes are torn between upholding
national security – as they perceive it – and maintaining
social order on the one hand, and generally adopting
good governance practices, on the other; these practices
include promoting democracy and the ‘rule of law’,
promulgating accountability and combating corruption. 

Notwithstanding the security issue, Arab governments
can help knowledge and knowledge-based industries to
flourish by creating an environment conducive to
enlightening young minds, nurturing creativity and
scientific enquiry and generally encouraging people to
work harder. By allowing citizens to enjoy the basic
freedoms of expression and association, in other words,
by allowing citizens to participate in their own
governance, governments can contribute to mitigating
the brain drain of scientists and intellectuals.

By applying laws fairly and equally, governments support
businesses and attract investment to their societies.
Without good governance, achieving a knowledge society
that simultaneously advances human development,
innovation and economic growth will be difficult, if not
impossible.

Universities, in particular, can only produce quality higher
education and R&D that responds better to national socio-
economic needs if freedom, democracy and tolerance are
allowed to prosper within their walls. 

For the purposes of the present report, two governance
indicators will be examined to gauge where Arab countries
stand: the rule of law and voice and accountability.

Rule of law
The ‘rule of law’ has been described as a yardstick as
important as the Millennium Development Goals (see
Annex II) and as being the key to achieving all of these
goals. Strengthening the rule of law lays the foundations
for safer societies that are able to offer their citizens
security, justice and development. The Arab Human
Development Report (UNDP, 2003) called for a ‘fair and
predictable rule of law’.

Recent research has shown that the performance of Arab
countries is a mixed bag. Kaufmann et al. (2008) measured
the ‘rule of law’ in 1998 and 2007 as the outcome of
governance in Arab countries. Even if the standard error
estimate is taken into account, Qatar emerges from their
survey as the only Arab country to rank above the 75th
percentile on a global scale in 2007. Four Arab countries
rank around the 65th percentile: Oman, Kuwait, United
Arab Emirates and Bahrain. These are followed by Jordan,
Tunisia and Saudi Arabia around the 60th percentile. A
further two Arab countries rank around the 50th percentile
mark: Egypt and Morocco. The remaining countries rank

below the 40th percentile, with Iraq recording the lowest
score. Noteworthy is that the rule of law has actually
receded since 1998 in Iraq, Lebanon, Morocco, Saudi Arabia,
Syria and in the West Bank and Gaza.

Voice and accountability
An ‘independent knowledge sphere’, in which knowledge
can be produced and shared without political interference,
must be an objective of all Arab governments in their
quest to achieve sustainable development. The foundation
of this knowledge sphere lies in providing and sustaining
an environment conducive to creativity and R&D

entrepreneurship, where freedom of opinion, speech and
assembly prevail to stimulate STI.

Although the Cold War of the 20th century and other recent
history have shown that progress in S&T is possible under
totalitarian regimes, any progress has rarely benefited the
population under such regimes. Cutting-edge innovation is
more likely to thrive – and endure – in open societies. Most
importantly, gains in knowledge production in such
societies are more likely to permeate society as a whole.

Here again, the region’s showing for the ‘voice and
accountability’ indicator over the past decade has been
disappointing. According to the study by Kaufmann et al.
(2008), the top five Arab countries for this indicator are
Lebanon, Kuwait, Morocco, Qatar and Jordan. However, 
even for these countries, the scores are low by international
standards, as all five rank between the 35th and 30th percentiles.
A further four countries have shown a marked improvement:
Bahrain, Algeria, Djibouti and Iraq. Overall, 12 out of 18 Arab

countries and territories registered a decline in ‘voice and
accountability’ between 1998 and 2007, including four of the
top five countries for this indicator: Egypt, Jordan, Kuwait,
Lebanon, Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, Morocco, Oman, Syria,
Tunisia, United Arab Emirates, the West Bank and Gaza and
Yemen.

THE S&T LANDSCAPE

Innovation not yet part of S&T parlance
Interest in S&T was kindled in the majority of Arab
countries after the Second World War, when most gained
independence. Universities and research centres were
founded principally by central governments from the
1960s onwards. National S&T policies would come much
later. Jordan, for example, founded its main national
university, the University of Jordan, in 1962 and its main
industrial research centre, the Royal Scientific Society, in
1970, yet adopted a National Science and Technology

255

Arab States 14 [P3]:Layout 1  18/10/10  19:10  Page 256

UNESCO SCIENCE REPORT 2010

Policy only in 1995. Saudi Arabia adopted its own national
policy for S&T as recently as 2003 (Al-Athel, 2003).

Today, many Arab countries still possess no national policies
or strategies for S&T. However, they are in the process of
taking this important first step. Where S&T policies do exist,
they are either too ambitious or ambiguous. All Arab
countries nevertheless have sectoral policies, such as those
for agriculture, water resources and the environment. 

Innovation is not yet part of S&T parlance in the region.
This may be attributed to the weak linkages overall
between private and public R&D, as evidenced by the 
low output of patents. In 2003, Tunisia carried out an
innovation survey as a first step towards remedying this
situation. The United Arab Emirates is the highest-ranking
Arab country in terms of its capacity for innovation. It
comes 27nd out of the 133 economies covered by the
Global Competitiveness Index 2009/2010, followed by
Saudi Arabia (32nd), Qatar (36th), Tunisia (38th), Oman (55th)
and Jordan (59th) [WEF, 2009].

Among recent developments, a European Union–Egypt
Innovation Fund has been established at the Egyptian
Ministry of Scientific Research as part of a joint research,
development and innovation programme. Set up in 2008,
the fund will support projects for applied research on a
competitive basis, with special emphasis on innovation
(Mohamed, 2008).

The establishment of science parks in Bahrain, Morocco,
Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia and the United Arab Emirates
represents a move towards partnerships in innovation
between private and public R&D. In 2009, Jordan was in the
process of launching El-Hassan Science Park as part of a
major science project in Amman and Egypt was setting up
its own Mubarak Science Park.

Politics and policies
But why should any Arab country have an S&T policy in the
first place? What would the objective be of such a policy? In
answer to these questions, we can cite two examples from
beyond the Arab world: Malaysia and the USA. Malaysia is
often cited by Arab decision-makers as a developing
country that has achieved economic success thanks, in part,
to the contribution of S&T. As for the USA, this world leader
in science is developing bilateral scientific relations with a
number of Arab countries, including Algeria and the Libyan
Arab Jamahiriya.

256

The former prime minister of Malaysia, Dr Mahathir
Muhammad, declared back in 1992 that the basic objective
of Malaysian S&T policy was to help Malaysia become fully
developed by the year 2020. Three decades earlier, in 1961,
John Fitzgerald Kennedy had said in a presidential address
that the objective of the US space programme within US
S&T policy was to put a man on the Moon before the end
of the decade. This became a reality on 20 July 1969, nearly
six years after the president’s death.

At the United Nations’ World Summit on Sustainable
Development in 2002, former Secretary-General Kofi
Annan outlined five key priority areas for sustainable
development. Known collectively by the acronym of
WEHAB, these areas are water, energy, health, agriculture
and biodiversity. For Arab countries, key targets will need
to be met in all five priority areas. Other priorities they
need to address include wealth creation and the Arab
region’s contribution to world civilization. 

National S&T capacity is required to address the priorities
symbolized by WEHAB. The authorities can also draw
upon this capacity in an emergency, such as in the event
of a natural disaster or pandemic along the lines of the
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome pandemic scare in
late 2002 and the advent of avian influenza (bird flu) in
2003 and the H1N1 influenza virus in early 2009. In Egypt,
the emergence on the global scene of H1N1, misnamed
‘swine flu’, caused mass confusion and the culling of all
250 000 of Egypt’s pigs, even though the virus did not
originate from pigs but rather was transmitted from one
human being to another. These drastic measures will have
no impact on the spread of the H1N1 virus in Egypt.
Rather, they are a knee-jerk reaction to the wide criticism
levelled at the authorities after they were slow to respond
to the bird flu epidemic – thought to have resulted in the
disease becoming endemic in the country – coupled with
fears of the bird flu virus mutating in Egypt’s pigs to form a
new and more dangerous influenza virus (El-Awady, 2009). 
It is regrettable that the media missed a golden
opportunity here to inform the public dispassionately of
the facts and thereby avoid widespread panic.

Towards an Arab plan for S&T
During the Arab Summit of March 2010, the Heads of
State adopted a resolution mandating the General
Secretariat of the League of Arab States to develop an S&T
strategy for the entire Arab region, in co-ordination with
specialized Arab and international bodies. This strategy is

Arab States 14 [P3]:Layout 1  18/10/10  19:10  Page 257

due to be submitted to the upcoming Arab summit in
2011 for adoption. It is expected to address the important
issue of facilitating the mobility of scientists within the
region and to enhance collaborative research with the
sizeable community of expatriate Arab scientists. 

Both the strategy and the subsequent Arab Science and
Technology Plan of Action (ASTPA) will be drawn up by a
panel of experts from the region with the institutional
support of the Arab League Educational, Cultural and
Scientific Organization (ALECSO), the Union of Arab
Scientific Research Councils and UNESCO, among others. 

ASTPA will envisage both national and pan-Arab initiatives
in about 14 priority areas, including water, food,
agriculture and energy. It is also expected to recommend
the launch of an online Arab S&T observatory to monitor
the S&T scene in Arab states and highlight any
shortcomings in implementation. One of the keys to
implementing measures at the country level will lie in first
identifying some of the national challenges that Arab 
countries face.

One example from the Arab world is Kuwait, which for
some time was a leading regional hub for S&T until the
Second Gulf War of 1990–1991. In 2008, Kuwait adopted a
plan to reform its S&T sector by facing up to a number of
challenges that hindered development. According to the
journal Alrai (2008), these include:

I the absence of an S&T governance mechanism at state

level; 

I low gross domestic expenditure on R&D (GERD);
I a lack of co-operation between scientific organizations

and productive sectors;

I a low technology component, leading to few

manufactured exports and a limited number of 
high-tech exports;

I a poor capacity to innovate according to society’s

needs;

I a lack of databases providing information on S&T;
I challenges facing organizations involved in 

science.

The above challenges are as true for Kuwait as for other
Arab states. To address them, political support for S&T at
the highest level is required, coupled with affirmative
government action, an upgrade of existing STI
infrastructure and an increase in GERD.

Arab States

Needless to say, for any country’s S&T policy to be
implemented successfully with public backing, it is critical
for its objectives to be clearly stated. These must also be
understood by the executive branch of government. For
instance, is the objective for a given Arab country to
mould society into a fully industrialized, export-oriented
economy? In the agriculture sector, is the objective to
achieve food security? It would clearly be beneficial if
reasonable targets were set at the outset, as this would
provide the implementing agencies with a benchmark for
measuring progress. Through regular appraisals, they
could then make any necessary adjustments to improve
the rate of implementation.

R&D governance
Research has shown that the bulk of S&T research in the
Arab world is carried out within the higher education
system, even in Egypt where this represents 65% of R&D
(IDSC, 2007). Table 1 shows that, in eight Arab countries, it
is the ministries of higher education and scientific
research that are responsible for R&D. In another five
countries, councils and government academies assume
this role. This function falls to universities and research
centres in four Arab countries, to ministries of education
in three and to the ministry of planning in one (Saleh,
2008).

Only seven Arab countries or territories out of 22 have a
national academy of sciences or play host to a
supranational academy (Table 2). This is an astounding
fact, as academies of sciences, being strong advocates of
science and impartial advisory bodies, have been at the
vanguard of scientific endeavour in advanced countries
such as the USA, UK and France for centuries. They are also
part of the landscape in economically emerging
economies such as Brazil, China, India, Malaysia and
Mexico (see also Box 1).

The organization of science at the institutional level is
crucial for the effectiveness of R&D. In Arab countries, the
indifference shown by decision-makers to S&T is a major
contributor to the current vegetative state of S&T.
Furthermore, the kaleidoscope of institutional models
renders it quite difficult for Arab states to move forward
collectively. If meaningful regional collaboration in S&T is
to develop beyond individual scientists working together
on small research projects and publishing joint research
work, some uniformity needs to be established among the
institutions responsible for science in the Arab region.

R&D INPUT

Trends in R&D expenditure
GERD as a percentage of GDP has been consistently low 
in the majority of Arab countries for over four de cades
(Figure 4). It is much lower than the world average. 
It varies from 0.1 to 1.0% of GDP, whereas advanced
countries spend over 2.5% of GDP on R&D. 

Countries such as Egypt, Qatar and Tunisia have set
themselves ambitious targets for GERD. In November
2006, Qatar announced that it was lifting GERD to 2.8% 
of GDP over five years (Shobakky, 2007). Since then, Qatar
has launched a number of initiatives in S&T and education
and is approaching this figure for GERD, according to
Weingarten (2009). The figure for Egypt remained stable at
0.23% of GDP in 2007, although there are plans to raise it
to 1% of GDP over the next five years. Meanwhile, Tunisia’s
spending on R&D has been climbing steadily since 2000.
In 2005, it was the leading Arab country in terms of its
R&D effort, which stood at slightly more than 1% of GDP.
The government’s objective is to reach a GERD/GDP ratio
of 1.25% by 2009, of which 19% would be funded by the
business sector (Arvanitis and Mhenni, 2007).

In 2005, Jordan introduced a law whereby 1% of the net
profit of public shareholding companies was transferred to 
a special R&D fund to finance research. Another law has
since been introduced that compels public and private
universities to allocate 5% of their budgets annually to R&D.
Together with the funding made available by the Middle

Box 1: The Islamic World Academy of Sciences

Launched in 1986, the IAS was the
brainchild of a handful of scientists
who persuaded the Organisation of
the Islamic Conference (OIC) to
establish the academy to serve the
S&T community in OIC countries and
others in the developing world. It was
created in Amman (Jordan) as an
independent non-political, 
non-governmental organization.

The IAS combines three different
functions. Firstly, it is a learned society

that promotes the values of modern
science. The IAS identifies and
honours high achievement and
disseminates the latest scientific
achievements internationally through
meetings and publications. 

A second function of the IAS that

is yet to be fully realized is that of
acting as a funding agency to
support outstanding scientists in
undertaking imaginative and 
far-reaching research. 

Thirdly, the IAS leads the scientific
community of the OIC in its relations
with governments, scientific societies
and academies of sciences
worldwide.

The IAS receives seed funding

from Jordan and raises its budget for
activities from the OIC and other
international bodies, including UN
agencies.

Box 2: The Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Foundation

In 2007, Mohammed bin Rashid, the
ruler of Dubai and Prime Minister of
the United Arab Emirates, launched 
a foundation to help build  ‘a
knowledge-based society’ in the
region. With an initial endowment of
$10 billion, the foundation will invest
in knowledge creation and in
translating knowledge into goods 
and services, as well as in human
development. It will focus on
developing and nurturing a

generation of future leaders and on
elevating research, knowledge
creation and higher education
infrastructure to international
standards. It will also stimulate
entrepreneurship and innovation 
and pay special attention to culture,
heritage and cross-cultural
understanding in the region.

The foundation’s programmes
include publishing an annual Arab
Knowledge Report issued in 

co-operation with the United Nations
Development Programme, 
a scholarship programme and a grants
programme to support Arab authors
wishing to publish books in Arabic.

Future projects will include

teacher training programmes, online
education for women and initiatives
for translating acclaimed scholarly and
scientific works into, and from, Arabic.

East Science Fund, these measures will considerably raise
Jordan’s GERD, starting from 2008.

In 2008, Kuwait endorsed a five-year plan to reform the
country’s S&T sector, partly by increasing the budget from
0.2% of GDP in 2008 to 1% of GDP in 2014 (Alrai, 2008). 

Turning now to the Arab private sector, by all accounts,
spending here is minimal. Out of 131 countries studied,
Tunisia ranked 36th in terms of private companies’
expenditure on R&D. Qatar and the United Arab Emirates
both ranked 42nd, Jordan 96th, Egypt 99th, Syria 108th and
Bahrain 119th (Waast, 2008).

Two promising new initiatives have been launched recently
in the United Arab Emirates and Jordan which will make
more funds available in future for scientific activities. The
first is the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Foundation
(Box 2) and the second, the Middle East Science Fund 
(Box 3). Both initiatives offer grant programmes for regional
research projects in priority areas for Arab countries.

Researchers in the Arab world
Arab countries have not produced a critical mass of full-
time equivalent (FTE) researchers in the majority of
disciplines. Moreover, links between universities and
research centres remain weak. This leads to little or no co-
ordination at the national level between research
communities. Also, even when fresh graduates are ready to
become engaged in research, there is often no capacity
within the R&D system to absorb them, or even any
willingness on the part of senior researchers to mentor
young minds.

To make matters worse, unemployment within the R&D
community is high, especially among women researchers,
who constitute around 35% of the total researcher
community in Arab countries, according to estimates by the
UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS).

Estimating R&D personnel is a difficult task, as counting
only individuals whose primary function is to perform
R&D would result in underestimating the national effort.
On the other hand, to do a headcount of everyone
spending some time on R&D would lead to an
overestimate. The number of individuals engaged in R&D
must, therefore, be expressed in full-time equivalents of
the time spent on R&D, both in the government and
private sectors.

The survey carried out in 2006 by UNESCO, ALECSO and the
Arab Academy of Sciences covered both the numbers of
FTE researchers and support staff in Arab states (Saleh,
2008). The figures for FTE researchers only are presented in
Figure 5. It can be concluded from this study that the
numbers of FTE researchers in the majority of Arab
countries are small in comparison to a country like
Argentina, for example, with its 980 FTE researchers per
million population in 2007, or Spain (2 784), or Finland 
(7 382), according to the UIS.

Only a handful of Arab researchers have been
internationally recognized. The annual L’Oréal–UNESCO
Awards for Women in Science bestow US$ 100 000 each on
five women, one from each continent. Of the 13 recipients
of this award for the Africa and Arab States region between
1998 and 2010, five came from Arab countries: Egyptian

More surprising is the fact that only one of the world’s top

Annaba in Algeria (ISI, 2009).

The only Nobel laureate in a scientific discipline to come
from the Arab world is Egyptian-born Ahmed Zewail, who
received the distinction for chemistry in 1999 while working
at the California Institute of Technology in the USA.

R&D PRIORITIES

Arab countries speak almost in unison when it comes to
their designated S&T priorities: water and energy. The
traditional sector of agriculture also features in the S&T
policies of some Arab countries. The relatively new fields of
information and communication technologies (ICTs),
nanotechnology and biotechnology are also viewed as
priority research areas (Arab League, 2008).

Water security
With the exception of Sudan and Iraq, all Arab countries
are water-poor, meaning that water is unavailable in
sufficient quantities for household use, industry or
agriculture. In agriculture, modern water-saving
technologies have been adopted in many Arab countries
and some regional initiatives have been launched.

UNESCO SCIENCE REPORT 2010

One such initiative is the International Centre for Biosaline
Agriculture, based in Dubai (Box 4).

The shortage of water for agriculture has led some Arab
states to lease large plots of arable land in countries like
Sudan to grow food. These countries include Saudi Arabia
and Kuwait. Foreign direct investment in Sudan’s
agriculture sector in the form of land leasing amounted to
US$279 million in 2007. The Sudanese government aims to
secure US$1 billion in from Arab and Asian investment
groups in 2009–2010. This amount has already been
designated for 17 lead projects, covering a land area of 
880 000 ha in northern Sudan (Sudan Tribune, 2008). 

The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) is
increasingly sceptical about the wisdom of such investments,
however, and has pointed to failures of previous mechanized
farming schemes to observe fallow periods, improve land
use and respect prior tenure relations (UNEP, 2007). Although
such projects seem to be commercially viable from the
investor viewpoint, depending on the scale and types of crop
grown, they cannot be a real alternative to attempting to
achieve national, or at least regional, food security. 

Energy security
Energy insecurity is another strategic quandary that many
Arab countries face. In their quest to diversify energy
sources, many Arab states have embarked on R&D
programmes to develop alternative energy sources, 
such as solar and wind energies. 

Jordan embarked on a solar energy research programme in
1972. Jordan’s National Agenda, a government policy
adopted in 2005, stipulated that the projected share of
solar energy in the country’s total energy mix should rise to
3% by 2015, by which time 80% of households ought to be
using solar energy water collectors (Badran, 2006). This is
an achievable target for Jordan which would reduce the
national energy bill of imported oil by about the same
percentage. Furthermore, it is an environment-friendly
technology that is relatively cheap to install and maintain.

Morocco is also increasing investment in renewable
energies. The country aims to raise the share of renewable
energy sources from 4% of the total to 12% by 2012. 
A unit within the National Centre for Scientific and
Technological Research is devoted to the Renewable
Energy Economy and Technologies and the Moroccan
National Electricity Office has put together a 
US$3.2 billion renewable energy investment plan for
2009–2014. The plan provides for the development of
local wind energy technologies and farms, solar energy
demonstration projects and greater investment in R&D.
Within the plan, a ‘knowledge campus’ is to be designed
to strengthen research and training in clean technology.
An industrial park for clean energy is also under
construction in Oujda near Morocco’s border with Algeria. 
At a cost of US$219 million, the park is expected to open
its doors in 2010. It will be supporting private investment
and companies specializing in renewable energy
(Sawahel, 2008a).

Box 4: The International Centre for Biosaline Agriculture

The International Centre for Biosaline
Agriculture (ICBA) is a centre for
applied R&D based in Dubai in the
United Arab Emirates. The centre was
established in 1999 with strong
support from the Islamic Development
Bank and the Government of the
United Arab Emirates. It is developing
and promoting the use of sustainable
agricultural systems that use saline
water to grow crops. 

The centre initially focused on

forage production systems and
ornamental plants in countries of the

Gulf Co-operation Council and other
parts of the Islamic world. The
technologies developed by ICBA are,
however, of global value and
importance. Wherever farmers face
the problem of saline soils or
irrigating with salty water, ICBA can
help.

ICBA also endeavours to

demonstrate the value of saline water
resources for the production of
environmentally and economically
useful plants. It plans to transfer its
research results to national research

services and communities in the
Islamic world and elsewhere. 

ICBA will help water-scarce

countries improve the productivity,
social equity and environmental
sustainability of water use through an
integrated water resource systems
approach, with special emphasis on
saline water and water of marginal
quality.

Box 5: The Regional Centre for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency 

The Regional Centre for Renewable
Energy and Energy Efficiency
(RCREEE) came into existence in Cairo
in June 2008. It acts as a platform for
regional exchanges on policy issues
and technological questions. In
addition, RCREEE encourages the
participation of the private sector in
order to promote the growth of
regional industry.

RCREEE has ten founding

members: Algeria, Egypt, Jordan,

Lebanon, Libyan Arab Jamahiriya,
Morocco, Palestinian Autonomous
Territories, Syria, Tunisia and Yemen.
Egypt is serving as host country for
the centre.

During the launch phase, RCREEE
is being sponsored by Egypt through
the Ministry of Electricity and Energy.
The European Union, German Agency
for Technical Co-operation and
Danish International Development
Agency are its development partners.

These three development partners
have pledged to provide financial and
technical assistance to RCREEE worth
an aggregate value of 15 million €
over the initial five years from 2008 to
2012. In the future, RCREEE will be
funded through contributions from
the member states and income
generated from research and
consultancy work.

Jordan and Morocco are two of the ten founding
members of a think tank set up in 2008, the Regional
Centre for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency 
(Box 5).

Nanotechnology
Plans are underway to boost nanotechnology R&D in 
Egypt and Saudi Arabia. In Egypt, a North African
Nanotechnology Research Centre was set up in 2009.
Located at the ‘Smart Village’ near Cairo, this is a joint
initiative of IBM and the Egyptian government for research
in such nanotechnology-related fields as: Thin Film Silicon
Photovoltaics; Spin-On Carbon-Based Electrodes for Thin
Film; Photovoltaics; and Energy Recovery from
Concentrated Photovoltaic for Desalination. 

In Saudi Arabia, the national R&D organization is the King
Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology (KACST) based
in Riyadh. In February 2008, KACST and IBM agreed to
establish the Nanotechnology Centre of Excellence at
KACST. The centre will conduct research into
nanomaterials for solar energy and nanomembranes for
water desalination, combined with investigating new
methods for recycling plastics (Sawahel, 2008b).

R&D OUTPUT

Patents and publications
From the foregoing, we can see that the R&D landscape in
the Arab region is changing. However, it will take some
time before the results of current initiatives start to

emerge. Furthermore, the success of such initiatives will
depend largely on sustained national interest and
support, hard work and regional co-operation. Another
key factor will be whether or not researchers and research
institutions have the capacity to pool the know-how that
each has acquired so that this can be reinvested to
develop related new technologies and products that are
economically viable.

Notwithstanding the fact that the number of published
journal articles is but one measure of the research interest
of a country, research carried out by Thomson Reuters 
and cited by Naim and Rahman (2009) reveals a certain
heterogeneity in research strengths in the region. The
research strength of Egypt, Morocco and Algeria lies in
chemistry, whereas it is clinical medicine for Jordan,
Kuwait, Lebanon, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia and the
United Arab Emirates. Syria’s strength lies in plant and
animal science, whereas Qatar makes its mark in
engineering.

Given the meagre resources allocated to R&D in Arab
countries, it is imperative that an attempt be made to
synchronize research strengths, R&D initiatives and
national S&T priorities. Each country will have to optimize
resources carefully between investment in basic sciences
– the backbone of S&T capacity – and investment in
demand-driven research that can address national S&T
priorities and/or increase national wealth. One major
interdisciplinary project that can stimulate regional 
co-operation in S&T and thereby drive output is the
SESAME project being launched in Jordan (Box 6).

UNESCO SCIENCE REPORT 2010

Arab countries produce fewer books and fewer S&T
articles than many other regions of the world. According
to the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Foundation, 
20 Arab countries produce 6 000 books per year,
compared to 102 000 in North America (Lord, 2008).

According to Thomson Reuters Inc., the total number of
scientific research articles originating from Arab countries
stood at 13 574  in 2008, up from 7 446 in 2000. In terms of
articles per million population, it is Kuwait which ranks
first, followed by Tunisia (Figure 6). For this indicator, the
average for Arab countries is only 41, compared to a world
average of 147. Over the 2002–2008 period, all but
Mauritania showed an increase in the number of authored
scientific articles (Figure 7). With 2 026 published articles,
Tunisia came close to quadrupling its output. Egypt,
however, continues to lead the region for this indicator. 

From 2000 to 2008, there was a steady increase in the
number of Arab scientists collaborating with the diaspora.
This is evident from the number of scientific publications 
in international collaboration. The notable exception is
Morocco. Of the 3 963 publications published by 
Egyptian scientists in 2008, one-third (1 057) were 
co-authored by scientists outside Egypt (Figure 8).

As for patents, Figure 9 shows that their number increased
in most Arab countries from 2004 to 2008. However, Arab
countries still lag a long way behind in comparison with
relatively small countries such as Chile (19 patents in
2008) and Finland (894 in 2008). The Republic of Korea,
which back in the 1960s was on a par with Egypt in terms
of S&T output, acquired an astonishing 84 110 patents in
2008, compared to a total of just 71 patents for the entire
Arab region.

Box 6: The SESAME story 

It was Pakistani Nobel Laureate Abdus
Salam who first recognized the need
for an international synchrotron light
source in the Middle East more than 
25 years ago. An opportunity arose
when it was announced that the
Bessy I synchrotron source in Berlin,
Germany, was about to be
decommissioned. The Chair of the
Middle East Scientific Co-operation
Group, Sergio Fubini, and Herwig
Schopper, former Director-General of
the European Organization for
Nuclear Research (CERN), invited the
German government to donate the
Bessy I components to a project for an
international synchrotron light source
in the Middle East (the future SESAME).
The government agreed.

At a meeting convened by

UNESCO in 1999, countries from the
region set up an Interim Council for
SESAME under the chairmanship of
Herwig Schopper. In 2002, UNESCO’s
Executive Board approved the request
to place the SESAME centre under
UNESCO’s auspices.

264

Construction of the centre was
completed in Allan, Jordan, in 2008.
Once fully operational in 2014 with
three initial beamlines, SESAME will
offer the Middle East a world-class
laboratory for basic research and
numerous applications in biology,
medical sciences, material sciences,
physics, chemistry and archaeology. 

Synchrotron radiation is produced
by an electron beam accelerated in a
ring at almost the speed of light. The
refurbished microtron (Bessy I) installed
at SESAME successfully produced an
electron beam on 14 July 2009. The
booster synchrotron (also from Bessy I)
was being upgraded and installed in
2010. To meet the users’ demands, a
completely new 2.5 GeV storage ring
with a circumference of 133 m has
been designed by the SESAME staff
and will be built by 2014.

By 2010, more than 400 scientists

and engineers had participated in 
17 workshops and schools in the
Middle East and elsewhere on
applications in biology, materials

science and other fields, as well as on
accelerated technology. Approximately
65 of these men and women have
spent periods of up to two years
working at synchrotron radiation
facilities in Europe, the USA, Asia and
Latin America. The majority of these
facilities are situated in observer
countries, some of which have been
donating beamline components. The
12 observer countries include France,
Japan, Kuwait, the UK and USA.

SESAME will enable scientists to
work together across countries and
cultures within the same research
facility. UNESCO calls it a model project
for other regions, as it has brought
together people from nine countries
and territories who do not all see eye
to eye politically. In 2009, the members
of SESAME were Bahrain, Cyprus, Egypt,
Iran, Israel, Jordan, Pakistan, the
Palestinian Authority and Turkey.

TOWARDS THE KNOWLEDGE
ECONOMY
ICTs
The development of ICTs and their primary manifestation,
the Internet, has offered societies – and the STI
communities within – a new means of knowledge
accumulation, assimilation and production, a new means of
teaching, learning and communicating. ICTs have
undoubtedly helped research communities to access a
greater volume of information than before at a faster pace,
to undertake more complex research, achieve better results
and communicate with much more ease. Even if R&D in
informatics and computer science can be a complex and
expensive business, it necessitates relatively basic tools.
Writing complex software, for instance, does not require
elaborate laboratory equipment.

The majority of Arab states have successfully ridden the IT
wave, as the figures for Internet penetration in Table 3

demonstrate. This is due to the fact that ICTs are pervasive
and general-purpose technologies. Even before the
current global economic recession, telecommunications
the world over were undergoing a transformation towards
advanced Next Generation Networks and converged
services. This is revolutionizing the roles of telephone
companies, Internet service providers and media and
content delivery companies (GAID, 2009).

The leading Arab country in terms of Internet use is the
United Arab Emirates, which has a penetration rate of
almost 50%. Saudi Arabia and Morocco have both
overcome their late start in introducing Internet access
and have caught up with other countries in the region,
with Internet penetration rates of 22% and 21%
respectively. Syria, Algeria and to a lesser extent Iraq seem
to be trying to catch up, although language in the case of
the former two countries may represent a barrier, as the
second spoken language in both is French rather than
English.

The ICT sector in Jordan planned to reduce Internet access
tariffs in 2009, in order to raise the Internet penetration
rate to around 24% by the end of the same year. 

One regional organization that was ‘born digital’,
however, is the Bibliotheca Alexandrina (Box 7).

High-tech exports
High-tech exports are products with high R&D intensity,
such as in aerospace, computers, pharmaceuticals,
scientific instruments and electrical machinery. Some
Arab countries have a relatively advanced
pharmaceutical industry that can contribute to high-tech
exports.

High technology contributes to rapid growth and is a
major source of wealth generation. It contrasts with the
resource-based industries that dominated the 20th
century. High-tech exports are a function of a country’s
level of inward foreign direct investment, consumer
demand at home and technological infrastructure.

Seyom (2005) has shown that the state of a nation’s
technological infrastructure is dependent on two
variables: GERD per capita and the number of scientists
and engineers engaged in R&D. He has concluded that
good technological infrastructure has a positive,
significant influence on high-tech exports.

Figure 10 shows the share of high-tech exports as a
percentage of total exports for selected Arab countries.
With high-tech exports constituting around 10% of all
national exports, Morocco is the leading Arab country for
this indicator. However, the high-tech exports of a country
like Malaysia constitute as much as 55% of total exports.
This is due in part to the country’s developing
technological infrastructure but also to the multitude of
multinational companies that have set up manufacturing
hubs in Malaysia, unlike in the majority of Arab countries.

Figure 11 shows the Knowledge Economy Index (KEI) 
for the majority of Arab countries. Among non-oil
economies, Jordan achieves the highest score for this

on the other hand, has some way to go for the
education and innovation parameters used to calculate
the KEI, even though it boasts a high rate of Internet
penetration.
.
Higher education: forming the S&T labour force
In the Arab world, the number of students in higher
education has increased considerably, from 5.4 million 
in 2000 to 7.3 million in 2008. In 2000, there were 
1 907 students for 100 000 inhabitants. By 2008, this
number had increased to 2185, according to the UIS.

These increases have not been uniform across Arab
countries. This is due not only to the lack of financial
resources in some countries but also to factors related 
to policies, social values and so on. The issue of equal
access to higher education, on the other hand, can be
attributed to wealth divides between communities
within societies, geographical areas and social
categories, as well as to disparities in gender and age.

In 20 Arab countries, there are over 300 public and
private universities (Saleh, 2008). This corresponds to
one university per million population. This is less than

268

the world average, as there are around 10 000 universities
worldwide for a global population of about 6.7 billion. 

How do Arab universities compare with others?
The majority of universities in Arab countries are new. 
The older ones have not been able to keep up and have
seen their standing fall by international yardsticks.

Rankings of universities, although controversial, have
become increasingly popular. Two publications have
attracted wide attention from policy-makers, scientific
communities and the media since they began publishing
their own rankings: the journal of Shanghai Jiao Tong
University in China (SJTU, since 2003) and the Times
Higher Education Supplement in the UK (THES, since 
2004). In 2007, Cairo University was the only Arab
university to rank among SJTU’s top 500 universities in the
world. No Arab university has ever appeared in the THES
ranking.

Research by the statistical agency of the OIC placed only
nine Arab universities in the top 50 of the OIC member
countries (Table 4). Arab universities do not seem to
compare favourably with their OIC counterparts in Iran,
Malaysia or Turkey, in particular (SESRTCIC, 2007).

Inaugurated in 2002, the Bibliotheca
Alexandrina in Egypt seeks to
recapture the legacy of the original
Alexandria library which burnt down
2000 years ago, by disseminating
knowledge and becoming a forum for
dialogue, learning and understanding
between cultures and peoples. 

The Bibliotheca Alexandrina has

capitalized on opportunities

presented by ICTs. Library patrons can
access 21 core databases and 19 584
scholarly electronic journals, e-book
databases and other Internet
resources. The library has emerged as
a leader in the digitization of Arabic
manuscripts, maps, books and
pictures. It is also an active participant
in global campaigns to make
knowledge universally accessible. 

The Bibliotheca Alexandrina

reaches out to the general public,
especially the young. The library
includes special collections for youth,
as well as cultural performances and
programmes designed for young
audiences.

UNESCO SCIENCE REPORT 2010

We can deduce from the afore-mentioned studies that
higher education across the Arab region is in need of
serious reform. In the majority of countries, higher
education is succeeding only in producing bureaucrats
with little innovative capacity to meet the needs of the
private sector. There is a dire mismatch between the skills
companies are seeking and what most universities in the
region are producing. The result is millions of young
people with high expectations and no hope of fulfilling
their dreams.

Investment trends in higher education
Various governance models for higher education exist in
Arab countries. In the majority, a Ministry of Higher
Education is in charge of management, planning, policies
and strategies. In some countries, such a ministry is also
responsible for scientific research. Despite such an
elaborate set-up, it is almost impossible to estimate, for
example, how much Arab countries invest in higher
education. 

Research published by the Economic Research Forum
(Kanaan et al., 2009) reveals that government expenditure
on higher education amounted to 1.4% of GDP on
average for the countries of the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in
2007. This compares with 1.7% in Tunisia, 1.5% in Saudi
Arabia, 1.3% in Egypt, 1.2% in Yemen and Egypt, 0.8% in
Jordan and 0.5% in Syria. Jordan spends no less than 4.3%
of GDP on higher education but most of this comes from
the private sector (Kanaan et al., 2009).

Tunisia’s public spending on higher education constituted
around 25% of total public expenditure on education in
2007 (Abdessalem, 2009). Egypt made a similar commit -
ment in 2004 (28%) but investment was lower in Jordan
(18%) and Morocco (15%) for the same year. 

Table 5 compares average annual expenditure on
education in Arab states for 2001 and 2006. For many 
Arab countries, there has been little change, even though
government expenditure on education has shown a
marked increase in Oman, the United Arab Emirates 
and, to a lesser extent, in Morocco. 

The stampede towards higher education
The percentage of young men and women enrolled in
higher education in Arab countries is increasing overall. 
In Lebanon and the Palestinian Autonomous Territories,

about 50% of the age cohort is on the student rolls. 
In Algeria, Jordan, Lebanon, Oman, the Palestinian
Autonomous Territories, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia and
the United Arab Emirates, more women than men opt for
higher education.

If we compare the figures in Table 6, we find that the
total number of students enrolled in tertiary education
has increased significantly in Algeria, Jordan, Lebanon,
Oman, the Palestinian Autonomous Territories, Saudi
Arabia and Tunisia. The situation in Qatar has
deteriorated.

Arab countries fare well in terms of student gender
balance in higher education. At the bachelor degree level
however, the percentage of female students enrolled in
social sciences and humanities is around 10% higher
than for S&T disciplines (Table 7). It is interesting to note
that, although there were no female PhD students in S&T
streams in Bahrain, Oman or Jordan in 2006, women
accounted for more than 41% of PhD students in S&T
streams in Algeria, 38% in Egypt, 31% in Morocco and a
sizeable 29% in Saudi Arabia.

More than 125 000 university faculty members in Arab
countries are MSc and PhD holders, 30% of them women.
Some researchers have put this figure at over 170 000
(Waast et al., 2008) but this could be due to the inclusion
of faculty teaching at more than one university, meaning
they would be counted more than once.

Despite a sizeable teaching community, in the majority of
Arab countries, the student/teacher ratio falls short of the
OECD average of 14 students per faculty member or even
the world average of 16 students. Statistics dating from
2004 reveal that, in Egypt for example, the ratio was 1:30
and 1:27 in Jordan. Only in Lebanon does the ratio surpass
the OECD and world ratios by an impressive margin, at 1:8
(Waast et al., 2008).

Three regional initiatives exemplify recent top-down
initiatives in higher education: Qatar’s Education City; 
the Masdar Institute in Abu Dhabi, and the King Abdullah
University of Sciences and Technology in Saudi Arabia
(Boxes 8, 9 and 10). These initiatives are likely to staunch
brain drain in Arab countries like Algeria and Egypt which
have been hit by an exodus of talent. 

Figures released by the National Science Foundation in

I Although extensive and well-established, the higher

education system in the Arab region has not
maintained the distinction it once had. Despite being
confronted with globalization and the ascendance of
private education, new knowledge and knowledge
delivery modes, it remains essentially supply-driven
rather than demand-driven.

I Arab universities are under pressure to fulfil many
complementary yet conflicting roles: knowledge
transmission (teaching), knowledge generation
(research) and knowledge preservation and diffusion.
University governance in the majority of Arab countries
remains unsteady, unable to assume one or more of
these roles successfully. This is further complicated by
governments exerting undue influence over
universities, mainly out of political considerations. 

I The archaic hierarchical system of promotion and

incentives at universities remains a major hurdle. As
knowledge transmitters, universities in Arab countries
must aim to form highly productive work-ready
professionals, not bureaucrats, with the appropriate
skills to address economic needs and opportunities, as
well as those of the economy’s component industries
and sectors. This requires student admission policies
and faculty recruitment policies that are essentially
merit-based and transparent.

I Arab universities and research centres have been unable
to develop a smart R&D environment over the past four
decades. There is a certain improvisation in the way R&D is
rewarded. As clear long-term research policies are
generally lacking, researchers are never certain that they
will obtain requisite funding. Often educated and trained
in the West, faculty could implement the best research
practices they picked up during their studies. Instead,
they are frequently forced to take on heavy teaching
loads to supplement their income, leaving little time for
scientific research. Even sabbatical leave is rarely used for
research. As knowledge generators, universities are the

Arab world’s engine room for discovery and invention;
the principal creators and disseminators of new
knowledge. Research is considered the most salient
example of a country’s intellectual resources,
economic strength and global competitiveness.
Universities should be producers of research, not
investors. They currently spend too much time
looking for funding for research projects.

I The present system is eating away at precious

resources from teaching programmes, in order to
maintain research performance. Heavy teaching loads
may be relieved by a long-term faculty development
programme, the introduction of innovative university
management practices and by facilitating further the
movement of faculty between countries.

I Bilateral and trilateral exchanges of faculty and joint

research projects are rare among Arab universities
compared to the co-operation programmes concluded
with parties beyond the Arab world. Arab countries
should each attempt to have at least one model
university that excels in one role: teaching, research or
knowledge diffusion. This will make networking
between Arab universities of similar outlook easier. 

I An Arab Bologna Process is required to create an Arab
Higher Education Area along the lines of the European
model (see page 150). There is a need for Arab ministries
and other bodies responsible for higher education to co-
operate in areas such as the recognition of diplomas and
the exchange of information and expertise in higher
education. An Arab Bologna Process could make Arab
higher education more comparable, more competitive
and more attractive. 

CONCLUSION 

Arab countries have been aware of the importance of STI
for socio-economic development for at least four decades.
Many Arab countries have had a core STI system for as
long. However, little has changed in terms of the impact of
science and the scientific enterprise on achieving socio-
economic development, or generating new knowledge.

The challenges facing Arab countries in S&T is enormous.
However, they can be overcome with vision, commitment
and hard work. The huge strides made by countries that two
or three decades ago were at the same level of development
as Arab states, including Brazil, China, India, Ireland, Mexico
and the Republic of Korea, show that it is possible.

Box 10: King Abdullah University of Science and Technology 

King Abdullah University of Science
and Technology (KAUST) has been
built in Saudi Arabia as an
international, graduate-level research
university dedicated to inspiring a
new age of scientific achievement in
Saudi Arabia, the region and the
world. It is supported by a multi-
billion dollar endowment that is
governed by an independent, 

self-perpetuating Board of Trustees.
KAUST is merit-based and open to
men and women from around the
world.

KAUST’s core campus is located
on more than 36 000 km2 on the Red
Sea 80 km north of Saudi Arabia’s
second-largest city, Jeddah.

Since it opened in September
2009, AUST has pursued a research

agenda in four strategic areas: energy
and the environment; biosciences
and bioengineering; materials science
and engineering; and applied
mathematics and computational
science.

Although Arab decision-makers have been increasing
expenditure on education, there is still little political
patronage of science and the scientific endeavour,
despite a legacy of creativity and innovation. Lack of
expenditure on R&D is a major cause of the poor output
of the Arab STI system but it is not the only quandary.
The lack of a science culture in turn leads to a lack of
appreciation for science. So why do Arab decision-
makers seem more concerned with education than STI?
Can it be that education is viewed as a necessity,
whereas STI is considered a luxury? Basic education
empowers citizens to read, comprehend basic
mathematics and make a living. However, basic
education is not sufficient to create wealth, to address
concerns of food, water and energy security, to provide
better health services and better infrastructure. For that,
science is required. 

The major contemporary problems Arab countries face
which require scientific or technological solutions are
well known. Despite this, the purpose of scientific
research remains unclear. Research undertaken by the
higher education sector, although important, often
serves purely academic purposes.

Appreciation for S&T is also an almost alien concept in
the mindset of the Arab private sector, which has always
been strong in trading goods and services rather than
manufacturing. Even in instances where funding has
been no object, the private sector has been unable to
produce a critical mass of knowledge workers to utilize
these resources to meet national objectives, add to the
national and global pool of knowledge or produce
patents leading to products and services.

274

Another factor stalling change in Arab countries has
historically been the top-down approach to governance.
This places political leaders in a position where they
have to assume the role of championing science for the
scientific enterprise to blossom.

Arab countries today are nation states, a particularly
European invention that became obsolete with the
signing of the Treaty of Rome in 1959. Since then,
European countries have set about harmonizing their
economic and scientific policies. 

It is true that, in the Arab world, there are regional
umbrella organizations that do the job of the European
Union. There is the Arab League, which has been in
existence for over six decades. Its primary concern has
been to deal with political problems, however, causing
issues in S&T and higher education to be neglected by
this body. There is also the Organisation of the Islamic
Conference. This umbrella organization embracing
both Arab and non-Arab Islamic countries has made
some bold attempts to address S&T issues. However,
due to a chronic shortage of funds, it too has been
unable to implement its programmes fully.

Oil wealth has been a double-edged sword. On the one
hand, it has helped Arab countries to consolidate their
infrastructure, invest in service industries and promote
trade. On the down side, ‘easy money’ has meant that
STI-based development and industries took a back seat
until very recently. The slump in oil prices since 2008 has
given oil states a glimpse into the future when they will
no longer be able to count on oil for their major source
of income. 

Arab States 14 [P3]:Layout 1  18/10/10  19:10  Page 275

High-tech exports form Arab countries are negligible. 
The acquisition and application of technology is a
function of an enabling environment, yet this
environment is almost non-existent in many parts of 
the Arab world. For instance, although expenditure on
defence in Arab countries is among the highest in the
world, there is no home-grown defence industry. 

There is very little linkage between universities and
industry when it comes to research output and thus
little wealth generation via the commercialization of
R&D. In the majority of Arab states, intellectual
property regimes are very weak, providing little
protection for the output of scientists. A patent culture
being almost non-existent, researchers often come up
against a blank wall when attempting to commercialize
or otherwise develop their research output.

A number of Arab countries have a sizeable S&T
potential. This potential is often dispersed and
championed by individuals rather than institutions.
S&T output has been growing unsteadily over the past
three decades. Today, exploiting this output still relies
on a handful of dedicated knowledge workers based at
a few universities and research centres in the Arab
world. 

Some countries have begun to streamline R&D into
basic research, applied research and technological
development. They have also started assimilating
market parlance, not only when it comes to producing
papers and patents but also prototypes and products.
There are also those which are attempting to leapfrog
the development cycle by importing ready-made
models of research centres and universities; this may
yield success but only at the local level unless an inter-
regional component is added.

Last but not least, the stability and security of Arab
countries cannot simply be a function of military
expenditure and expenditure devoted to upholding
law and order. Long-term security and prosperity for all
countries in the region can only be achieved by
assuring the triple helix of food, water and energy
security, combined with sustainable and equitable
socio-economic development in tolerant societies
where accountability and rule of law prevail. S&T can
achieve some of these goals, if not all.

There are currently over 40 ministries responsible
for national S&T policies in the region.
Nevertheless, a number of critical problems have
to be resolved before these bodies can render the
services expected of them. These problems are
largely caused by a shortage of funds and
inefficient management and organization of S&T.

INTRODUCTION

The Millennium Declaration set 2015 as the target date for
achieving the eight Millennium Development Goals.
These goals established quantitative benchmarks for
halving extreme poverty in all its forms (see Annex II). 
As the date approaches, the world finds itself mired in an
unprecedented economic recession. In sub-Saharan Africa
and Southern Asia, both the number of poor and the
poverty rate increased in some of the least-growth
economies in 2009, a factor exacerbated by the growing
burden of catastrophes caused by climate change and
natural disasters. Current projections suggest that overall
poverty rates in the developing world fell in 2009 but at a
much slower pace than before the downturn (UNDESA,
2009). For some countries, this may mean the difference
between reaching, or not, their poverty reduction target.

Replete with natural resources, intellectual capital,
indigenous knowledge and culture, Africa is nevertheless
at a comparative disadvantage when it comes to overall
development because of its low investment in science and

technology (S&T). This results in poor infrastructure
development, a small pool of researchers and minimal
scientific output. The situation is exacerbated by
population growth, conflicts, poor governance and
political instability, food insecurity, poverty and disease,
among other factors. 

The continent has made several bold attempts to turn
around its development fortunes through treaties that
include the Monrovia Strategy (1979), the Lagos Plan of
Action (1980), the Abuja Treaty (1991) establishing the
African Economic Community and, most recently, the
adoption of Africa’s Science and Technology Consolidated
Plan of Action (CPA) by the African Union1 in January 2007.
Despite these efforts, Africa remains the poorest and most
economically marginalized continent in the world 
(Figure 1). The continent has often adopted a short-term
view of human development, persisting in a reliance on

1.   Although the African Union embraces the entire continent, we shall be
focusing in the present chapter on countries south of the Sahara, since
North Africa is covered in Chapter 13.

reliance on external financial support, which often targets
short-term goals. As a result, the continent has failed to
invest in science, technology and innovation (STI) as
drivers of economic growth and long-term sustainable
development (Mugabe and Ambali, 2006). This is evident
in Africa’s low public expenditure on research and
development (GERD) [Table 1]. Countries will need to
design and implement policies, as well as create
institutional arrangements, which promote the
development and application of S&T to solving specific
problems related to each of the Millennium Goals.

The need for change was acknowledged by the Malawi
President Bingu wa Mutharika in January 2007, at the
African Union summit in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. He
affirmed that building S&T capacity was the only sure way
to break the long-standing cycle of extreme poverty that
has gripped the African continent for decades. ‘We have
depended on donor countries for scientific development
for so long,’ he noted. ‘It is time we committed more
resources in our national budget to advance S&T.’ 

In the past decade, a number of African countries have been
progressively enhancing their S&T capacity as a strategy for
extricating themselves from the grips of poverty, hunger
and disease, and as a means of achieving industrial
development and social transformation. Attempts have
been made by many African governments to develop
national STI policies for their respective countries. In 2008
alone, 14 countries formally requested UNESCO’s assistance
with science policy reviews: Benin, Botswana, Burundi,
Central African Republic, Côte d’Ivoire, Democratic Republic
of Congo, Madagascar, Malawi, Morocco, Senegal,
Swaziland, Togo, Zimbabwe and Zambia. 

African countries have begun to recognize that, without
investment in S&T, the continent will stay on the periphery
of the global knowledge economy. A number of countries
are taking steps to establish a national innovation system
in an approach generally borrowed from the Organisation
for Economic Cooperation  and Development (OECD).
These efforts are most visible in South Africa, where GERD
as a percentage of GDP grew from 0.73% in 2001 to 0.94 in
2006, according to the UNESCO Institute for Statistics. 

However, as we shall see in the pages that follow, sub-
Saharan Africa still has a long way to go to reach the
eldorado of the knowledge economy, not only in terms of
innovation but also as regards the other three pillars of

Sub-Saharan Africa 

the knowledge economy: a sound economy and
institutional regime; an educated, creative population
capable of utilizing knowledge effectively; and a dynamic
information infrastructure. Although GDP per capita rose
in most African countries between 2002 and 2008, it
remains low by world standards, with the notable
exception of Angola and Equatorial Guinea where a surge
in oil exploitation in recent years has led to a meteoric rise
in national income. Oil production and related activities
contribute about 85% of GDP in Angola and fuelled
growth averaging more than 15% per year from 2004 to
2007, even if GDP contracted in 2009 (-0.6%) as a result of
the drop in oil prices and the global recession. In
Equatorial Guinea, the discovery of large oil reserves
caused GDP to bound by approximately 22% in 2007 and
12% the following year before falling oil prices plunged
the economy into a negative growth of about 1.8% in
2009 (CIA, 2010). This example highlights the need for oil-
rich African countries to diversity their economies in order
to improve their resilience to fluctuating global oil
markets, a policy adopted by Nigeria in recent years 
(see page 309).

In many African countries, subsistence agriculture
occupies most of the population, even though it
contributes a much smaller share to GDP. Subsistence
farming still predominates in Angola, Burundi, Burkina
Faso and Equatorial Guinea, for instance. Moreover, in all
African countries south of the Sahara, enormous hurdles
remain in achieving more equitable access to both
education and information and communication
technologies (ICTs).

AN INVENTORY OF STI CAPABILITIES
IN AFRICA

Persistently low investment in STI
As we have seen in Table 1, R&D attracts less public
investment in sub-Saharan Africa than the military, health
or education sectors. Only South Africa is approaching the
target of a 1% GERD/GDP ratio, the level recommended by
UNESCO and, more recently, by the African Union summit
in January 2007. Even more worrisome is that many
countries either have no record of the share of GDP they
devote to R&D or simply allocate no funds at all to R&D.
This is most saddening for a continent desirous to develop
STI. All African countries would do well to take a leaf out
of South Africa’s book.

UNESCO SCIENCE REPORT 2010

An underexploited pool of human resources
Rising school rolls 
At 62%, sub-Saharan Africa holds the unenviable world
record for the lowest adult literacy rate, followed closely
by South and West Asia, at 64%. Despite this low rate,
many countries have achieved steep rises in adult literacy
rates over the past decade, including some with the
farthest way to go; Burkina Faso and Chad, for example,
doubled and almost tripled their literacy rates respectively
between 1999 and 2007. Public expenditure on education
in sub-Saharan Africa rose from 3.5% of GNP in 1999 to
4.5% in 2007, placing it on a par with the mean for
developing countries but still behind the mean for
developed countries (5.3%). Public expenditure on
education as a percentage of total government
expenditure was actually higher in sub-Saharan Africa in
2007 (17.5%) than the mean for the developed world
(12.4%) [UNESCO, 2010a].

The picture is brightest for primary education, where
the sub-continent registered strong progress between
1999 and 2007. During a period in which the size of its
school-age population increased by 20 million, sub-
Saharan Africa reduced its out-of-school population by
almost 13 million, or 28%. The strength of the region’s
progress can be gauged by a comparison with the
1990s: had the region progressed at the same pace as in
the 1990s, 18 million more children would be out of
school today. Nevertheless, one-quarter of sub-Saharan
Africa’s primary school-age children were still out of
school in 2007 and the region accounted for nearly 45%
of the world’s entire out-of-school population. Progress
in the region has been uneven. Some countries with
large out-of-school populations in 1999 have made
great strides, including Ethiopia, Kenya, Mozambique,
Tanzania and Zambia. Countries making only limited
progress include Liberia, Malawi and Nigeria 
(UNESCO, 2010a).

Despite commitment to international treaties and
declarations by most countries south of the Sahara,
access to secondary and tertiary education in sub-
Saharan Africa remains limited to a minority, with one-
quarter of countries showing gross enrollment rates of no
more than 26% for secondary education and just under
4% for university enrollment in 2008. Holding many
countries back is the substantial gender gap, with
schooling often remaining the privilege of boys. Gender
disparities in primary education increase with the level of

282

education, as can be seen in the drop in the percentage
of girls between the secondary and tertiary levels of
education (Table 2). Empirical studies find a distinct
correlation between university enrollment rates and
growth in national income in many countries (Moyer,
2007, cited in Urama, 2009). Analyses show that attaining
full primary education for all, which has been the main
focus of government policies in many African countries,
may be necessary but is not sufficient in itself to drive
development in most countries. For example, Togo and
Madagascar have attained over 90% primary school
enrollment rates but this has not translated into higher
national income (Urama, 2009). University enrollment
rates in sub-Saharan Africa are among the lowest in the
world. Overall, the contribution of higher education in
Africa to gross national income is very low (Moyer, 2007;
Botman et al., 2009).

A more in-depth analysis provided by Moyer (2007,
cited in Urama, 2009) suggests that the relative cost of
higher education per student as a proportion of gross
national income is higher in Africa than in the developed
countries. This situation leaves African higher education
in a dilemma, as African governments are the primary
source of funding. Therefore, if higher education does not
significantly contribute to growth in national income, it is
most likely that governments will prioritize other
development challenges such as poverty alleviation,
climate change adaptation, water insecurity, peace and
so on (Urama, 2009). However, it should be noted that
investment in higher education has a long-term impact
on national development.

Challenges for higher education 
Africa entered the Millennium with severe education
challenges at every level, as underlined in the African
Union’s Plan of Action for the Second Decade of Education
for Africa (2006–2015). To cope with these challenges,
conferences of ministers of education have reiterated the
need to broaden access to education, improve quality and
relevance, and ensure equity. Specific challenges for
African higher education systems include: 

■ poorly equipped laboratories and overcrowded lecture

rooms;

■ a need to adapt the higher education system to the

bachelor’s–master’s–doctorate triumvate, which is the
norm around the world;

I the fact that women are not only much less represented

than men in tertiary education but are also often confined
to so-called ‘feminine’ fields, such as the social sciences,
humanities, services and health-related courses, which do
not boost their chances of equal job opportunities with
men. What men and women choose to study is a key issue
in the debate about gender equality;

I an inadequation and fragmentation of curricula and

research programmes;

I the lack of a ‘culture’ of evaluation for teachers,

researchers and programmes;

I a lack of co-operation and partnerships with other
institutions at national, sub-regional, regional and
international levels ; 

I excessive bureaucracy in management procedures,
together with frequent strikes by students, teachers,
researchers or administrative staff, among others,
which considerably hamper the stability and
performance of institutions;

I a lack of linkages between academic research and
innovation, hampering socio-economic progress.

A small pool of researchers 
Table 3 shows that Nigeria counted the greatest number
of researchers in Africa in 2005. However, when the
number of researchers is assessed per million inhabitants,
Nigeria slips to fifth place behind Botswana, South Africa,
Senegal and Guinea. The percentage of women
researchers across the continent remains low, as does the
number of scientists and technicians per million

284

Africa [16] [P3]:Layout 1  18/10/10  19:14  Page 285

inhabitants. Also worrisome is the dearth of researchers
employed in the business and private non-profit sectors. 

Low scientific productivity in all but a handful of
countries 
South Africa dominates scientific publishing
Sub-Saharan Africa produced just 11 142 scientific articles in
2008. Its share of the world’s output has risen, however,
since 2002 from 0.9% to 1.1% (see page 10). Within the sub-
continent, South Africa produced almost half (46.4%) of the
total, followed by Nigeria (11.4%) and Kenya (6.6%) 
[Figure 2]. In other words, these three countries alone
produce two-thirds of the sub-continent’s scientific articles,
a reflection of their relatively sophisticated level of R&D. 

Most African countries were unable to produce 
100 publications in the natural sciences in 2008.
According to Bernardes et al. (2003), these figures are well
below the theoretical threshold that would trigger a
virtuous interaction between S&T. This threshold was in
the neighbourhood of 150 papers per million population
in 1998 and has since risen. Of some comfort is the
consistent, if modest, progression across the region in the
number of scientific papers recorded in Thomson Reuters,
Science Citation Index. Moreover, the language barrier
may be hampering the visibility of scientific research from
French- and Portuguese-speaking African countries in
international databases, even though many other factors
also come into play. See, for example, the case of Mali 
(see page 307).

African scientists publish mostly in the fields of clinical
medicine, biology and biomedical research, followed by
Earth and space science (Figure 3). In Kenya, the life
sciences represented as much as 93% of scientific articles
in 2008, compared to just 4% for Earth and space sciences.
In Nigeria, 84% of published articles concerned the life
sciences, compared to 6% for engineering and technology
and 5% for Earth and space sciences. South Africa, on the
other hand, has a more diversified research system.
Although two-thirds of South African publications relate
to the life sciences, the remainder of articles are fairly
evenly spread among the other major fields of science,
including chemistry, mathematics and physics.

Utility patents dominate intellectual property earnings
Table 4 shows the number of patents awarded to African
inventors by the United States Patents and Trademark
Office (USPTO) during 2005–2009. The continent

Sub-Saharan Africa 

produced 706 patents during this period, compared to
633 in 2000–2004 (Pouris and Pouris, 2009). It is
interesting to note that, if the continent produces 2.0% of
the world’s knowledge, as manifested in research
publications, it produces less than 0.1% of the world’s
inventions. Between 2005 and 2009, South Africa
produced two-thirds of the continent’s utility patents
(65%) but 87% of USPTO patents, a share comparable to
that for 2000–2004 (88% of the total).

NATIONAL STRATEGIES FOR
DEVELOPING TECHNOLOGICAL
RESPONSIBILITY IN AFRICA

Strengthening STI development in Africa will require a shift
from the business-as-usual approach to a more proactive
and engaging culture of technological responsibility. An
abundance of natural resources and low-cost labour do not
necessarily constitute in themselves decisive comparative
advantages for the continent, as the parameters of
international competitiveness are increasingly S&T- based.
African countries must improve their competitiveness not
by relying on low labour costs but rather by improving their
technical capacity. According to UNECA (2005) – the source
of inspiration for many of the recommendations that follow
–what Africa needs is nothing less than leadership and
democratization. If we are going to mobilize S&T for
sustainable development, all key stakeholders must be
involved in both policy formulation and implementation.
This is the way to avoid academic and elitist policies and to
define and strengthen the role of public institutions,
international partners, universities, non-governmental
organizations (NGOs), women’s organizations, civil society
and the private sector. This is also the way to ensure that
policies are tailored primarily to meet the specific needs of
end-users and clients. 

Improving governance
Today, in many African countries, there is a lack of stable
political leadership capable of providing a clear vision and
objectives for STI. The frequency of cabinet reshuffles in
many countries results in instability among top officials in
the ministries responsible for S&T, in turn leading to
shifting priorities and disturbances in programme
execution. This results in weak strategies for innovation
and technology transfer, which in turn foster inadequate
higher education and research systems with little
innovative or inventive potential. This critical

phenomenon requires a clear understanding by the head
of state and/or prime minister of the need for a strong,
transparent STI policy owned by all stakeholders and fully
articulated with the national socio-economic
development plan. In this regard, the idea of presidential
fora put forward by the late Professor Thomas Odhiambo
is worthy of consideration.

Institutions responsible for policy-making and
development are weak in many African countries,
particularly the smaller ones. Countries such as Angola,
Chad, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Djibouti, Eritrea,
Gabon, Gambia, Mauritania, Liberia, Sierra Leone and
Swaziland, among others, could benefit from programmes
that build institutional capacity in S&T policy formulation
and implementation. STI policy and operational institutions
created in the 1960s and 1970s with the aid of the United
Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA) need to
be reviewed in light of the new challenges posed by
globalization and technological innovation.

Current macro-economic policies and programmes also
tend to allocate too many resources to large public
enterprises concentrated mostly in urban areas, thereby
discriminating against small and medium-sized
enterprises. Even where policies designed to realize
development goals are in place, experience shows that
most African governments find it difficult to implement
them for reasons that include lack of finance, lack of
transparency, inadequate human resources and an undue
politicization of issues. In a vicious circle, low investment
in education and R&D in both the public and private
sectors has led to a penury of qualified personnel, eroding
the quality of science and engineering education at all
levels. Worse still, the infrastructure for R&D has been
neglected and is decaying. Universities and research
institutions are thus hard-pressed to acquire state-of-the-
art facilities to conduct basic research, forcing them to
depend on foreign institutions. 

To strengthen Africa’s technological regime will require
strong political leadership and a better integration of
cross-cutting STI policies with overall development
policies, including economic, financial, budgetary, fiscal,
labour, agricultural, industrial and micro-enterprise
development. This has far-reaching consequences for
policy-making, as it implies that S&T should move from
the periphery to the centre of the development policy
processes and pervade all relevant policy areas, impacting

Sub-Saharan Africa 

on the development and utilization of S&T. Success in this
realignment and ‘recentering’ requires strong political
commitment vis-à-vis S&T and the full engagement of the
S&T community. This recentering may be facilitated by the
setting-up or strengthening of parliamentary committees
on S&T. Such committees are already in existence in a
number of African countries, including Kenya, Nigeria,
South Africa and Uganda. The African Ministerial
Conference on Science and Technology (AMCOST) has
also set up its own parliamentary committee. Recentering
S&T may also be facilitated by the appointment of high-
profile, credible and respected S&T advisors to the
president, as in Nigeria, for example (see page 309). The
creation of interdepartmental S&T fora comprising focal
points from various ministries and government
institutions dealing with S&T issues may also be useful in
‘demonopolizing’ S&T responsibilities and in bringing S&T
issues to the heart of the development policy process.

Ensuring reliable data and indicators
Also hampering the elaboration of effective STI policies in
Africa is the lack of up-to-date, reliable data and indicators
on the current status of S&T, mostly due to the absence of
trained experts and organizational difficulties. African
institutions, ministries and organizations have not yet
adopted a culture of record-keeping and data banks. This
is a serious issue of concern which our governments and
institutions need to address urgently as a key deliverable
in the process of realizing their development goals. 
One of the objectives of Africa’s Science and Technology
Consolidated Plan of Action is to remedy this situation (see
page 297).

African economies also need to adopt new indicators to
evaluate skills and competencies acquired in traditional
sectors and assess their ability to promote linkages
between actors in the adoption and absorption of new
technologies. 

Grouping STI programmes into a single national system
To ensure the successful implementation of STI
programmes and activities in different countries of Africa,
there is a need for proper co-ordination and integration of
programmes and activities in the innovation system into
all national socio-economic planning issues. Presently, 
co-ordination of STI programmes and activities seems to
fall within the purview of the sole ministries of science
and technology. While it is proposed that these ministries
continue to serve as the main scientific advisory

This will bring together existing capabilities and help to

while encouraging interaction and linkages. 

paid to such key areas as agriculture, industry, energy and
water. In these areas, the generation of new knowledge, the
development of new technologies and the promotion of
innovation are crucial to achieving food security, diversifying
manufactured products, reducing poverty and protecting
the environment and the natural resources base. 

Improving infrastructure and capacity to develop
innovative solutions
Africa’s sustainable development will depend more and
more on its capacity to find innovative solutions to its
particular problems, including in the area of food
production, and its capacity to produce and market
competitive, innovative products and services. In this regard,
policies need to be put in place to develop national
innovation systems by filling existing gaps and
strengthening interaction between critical elements of the
system. Entrepreneurial capacities should be reinforced,
inter-firm partnerships should be encouraged and linkages
between the public and private sectors strengthened. This
new technological regime calls for special attention to be

In this regard, UNECA and UNESCO both support the
commitment by the New Partnership for Africa’s
Development (NEPAD) to create sub-regional centres and
networks of excellence for higher education and research,
with a view to promoting S&T in niche areas of high
priority for sustainable development. 

Nor should African countries underestimate the potential
of South–South co-operation for developing these niche
areas. Brazil, China, Egypt, India and Mexico have all
developed world-class research institutions in recent years
and are increasingly involved in South–South co-operation.
One recent example concerns the development of biofuels
in Sudan in co-operation with Brazil and Egypt (Box 1).

Box 1: South–South co-operation on biofuels: the case of Sudan

In June 2009, Sudan inaugurated its
first biofuel plant. In the next two
years, the plant is expected to
produce 200 million litres of ethanol
from sugarcane. The plant was built in
co-operation with the Brazilian
company Dedini, drawing on the
long-standing experience of Brazil in
the area of biofuels.

Another major project for the

development of biofuels in Sudan is
being carried out in collaboration with
Egypt. At a cost of US$ 150 million, it is
producing second-generation biofuels
from non-edible crops, including
agricultural waste such as rice straw,
crop stalks and leaves. This is proving to
be a good strategy, as it has a positive

impact on both the environment and
food security. By diverting agricultural
waste towards the production of
ethanol, the waste does not need to be
burned, thereby reducing pollution.
The use of agricultural waste also
avoids sacrificing food supplies to
energy production.

Strengthening the relationship between academia,
government and industry
In most African countries, there is very little interaction
between universities and industry, and very few universities
in the region conduct research and training programmes
pertinent to industrial needs. This shortcoming is coupled
with a mismatch between R&D activities and national
strategies and goals for industrial development. As a result,
local industries lack access to research findings from public
research institutions, particularly small and medium-sized
enterprises. It is common knowledge that the biggest
obstacle to the development of technological enterprises in
sub-Saharan Africa is not the lack of resources but their
isolation. Current S&T policies emphasize R&D input,
forgetting that innovation does not spring from an
aggregation of different forms of technological
infrastructure but rather from the quality of the
organization and the circulation of available resources. 

The Africa Commission Report (2009) concluded that African
universities were insufficiently geared to meeting the needs
of industry. The report maintained that graduates often
struggled to find employment, while many small businesses
lacked staff with the education and skills needed to drive
innovation. Essentially, the relationship between the
demands of the private sector and what universities teach is
too weak. The isolation of researchers and R&D institutions is
cited by many African scholars as being one reason for the
weak performance in building technological capabilities.
The lack of linkages between the needs of enterprises,
communities and R&D institutions is a real problem for the
development of innovation. Despite the concentration of
R&D in some fields like agriculture and medicine,
community services remain a peripheral appendage to the
university system in most African countries.

To bridge the gap between scientists, technologists and
industrialists, African governments should encourage and
support the establishment of interdisciplinary research
and training centres within universities in those areas of
S&T most relevant to the development of local industry. 
In particular, greater importance should be given to the
development of strong linkages between engineering
institutions, small-scale industries and the agriculture
sector with the principal aim of producing simple, modern
tools and equipment required by farmers to increase their
productivity and efficiency (Box 2). 

Small research and training units should also be formed and
strengthened in areas of cutting-edge technologies relevant
to industry, such as lasers, fibre optics, composite materials,
pharmaceuticals, fine chemicals and biotechnology. These
centres should operate as a joint venture between universities
and industry and should be run by a common board
involving high-level indigenous industrialists and academics.
Furthermore, to strengthen the linkages between research
institutions and industry, qualified staff and postgraduate
students in these institutions should be encouraged to
undertake specific development projects in industry. 

Protecting Africa’s intellectual and biodiversity capital
Harnessing S&T for sustainable development requires the
protection of intellectual capital and access to technology,
which are governed by a number of complex international
agreements. These include the Convention on Biodiversity
(1992), which, in Article 8, recognizes explicitly the
importance of traditional knowledge and creates a
framework for ensuring that local people share in the
benefits arising from the appropriation and use of such
knowledge and the biological resources of their
environment. Plant breeder’s rights and farmer’s rights are

290

Africa [16] [P3]:Layout 1  18/10/10  19:14  Page 291

Sub-Saharan Africa 

equally recognized in the Convention. These resources are
of great importance for Africa’s sustainable development
and they must receive adequate attention. Plant varieties,
which are protected by the International Convention for
the Protection of New Varieties of Plants (UPOV) and the
International Undertaking on Plant Genetic Resources
(IUPGR), constitute unique instruments through which
Africa can strengthen its capacity in S&T (UNECA, 2005). 
In this regard, the decision by the focal points of Ministers
of the African Agency of Biotechnology to dissolve this
institution in April 2008 is most unfortunate.

The Model Law adopted by the African Union in 2000 for the
Protection of the Rights of Local Communities, Farmers and
Breeders and for the Regulation of Access to Biological
Resources2 established a framework for national laws to
regulate access to genetic resources. Although the Model
Law has been severely criticized for putting African countries
on the defensive and for being too complex and
cumbersome for countries at an early stage of development,
it can be a useful resource for repositioning Africa in STI
development and for protecting the indigenous knowledge,
technological know-how and biological resources of African
countries. This is an important policy area for the African
Union to explore, in collaboration with other partners, such
as the World Intellectual Property Organization, African
Regional Intellectual Property Organization3 and the
Organisation africaine de la propriété intellectuelle.4

Of note is that the African heads of state formally adopted
the Pan-African Intellectual Property Organization in
January 2007 at the African Union summit in Addis Ababa,

Ethiopia. It will serve as a co-ordinating body rather than as
an office for the registration of intellectual property. At the
time of writing, the Pan-African Intellectual Property
Organization had not yet materialised, although it was on
the agenda of the AMCOST meeting in Cairo in March 2010.

An urgent need for ICT development
One factor contributing to the isolation of African scientists is
the communication barrier caused by the lack of
infrastructure in telecommunications and the limited access
to ICTs. ICTs are now also one of the most important assets for
enterprises wishing to compete in world markets and,
therefore, one of the main drivers of inclusion in the ‘global
village’. ICTs provide the main medium for the transfer of
information and knowledge. Most technologically advanced
countries are making massive investments in these
technologies. Public infrastructure can no longer be
conceived only in the traditional terms of roads, railways,
power, ports and airports. The availability of fast, affordable
and reliable connections to the Internet and development of
mobile telephones are some of the new technological
infrastructure that African countries need to put in place in
order to become competitive and remain so. Investment in
these technologies is crucial to give companies a global reach
and enable them to conduct efficient business transactions.

Box 2: Songhai: an agricultural centre of excellence

Songhai is an experimental farm
founded in Porto Novo in Benin in 
1985 by Dominican father Dr Godfrey
Nzamujo. The aim of this NGO is to
develop sustainable, integrated
agriculture to raise the population’s
standard of living. In addition to
practicing animal husbandry, crop-
growing and aquaculture, the farm
conducts agricultural research and
experiments with renewable energies.
Songhai also dispenses training and

provides the local population with
services to make their lives easier. For
instance, it manufactures and maintains
agricultural machines that are well
adapted to local conditions and less
costly than imported models. The farm
sells its own produce on site to earn
revenue and provide the local
population with fresh produce. 

After Nigerian officials visited the
experimental farm, a centre modelled
on Songhai was created in Amukpè in

the Delta State of Nigeria in 2002.

In 2008, Songhai was declared a
regional centre of excellence by the
United Nations and, the following year,
by the Economic Community of West
African States. With the support of the
United Nations, a Regional Project for
the Development of Agricultural
Entrepreneurship was launched in
Africa in 2008.

UNESCO SCIENCE REPORT 2010

Box 3: Science, ICTs and space, an EU–Africa partnership

The European Union–African Union
summit in Lisbon in December 2007
launched an EU–Africa partnership in
eight different areas. One of these
partnerships concerns Science, the
Information Society and Space. A
number of lighthouse projects are
being implemented within this
partnership in line with priorities
identified by Africa’s Science and
Technology Consolidated Plan of Action
(see page 297) and by the African
Regional Action Plan for the Knowledge
Economy, adopted at the World
Summit on the Information Society in
Tunisia in 2005. 

Under the science component of

the partnership, African research grants
are being provided worth €15 million
and a Water and Food Security and
Better Health in Africa project has been
earmarked for €63 million in funding.
The African Union Commission has also
contributed €1 million for the first year
of the Popularization of Science and
Technology and Promotion of Public
Participation project. The first African
Women Scientists award was held 

on Africa Day on 9 September 2009.

Concerning ICTs, the AfricaConnect
project will seek to integrate the African
research community at both regional
and international levels by improving
bandwidth. Meanwhile, the African
Internet Exchange System (AXIS) will
support the growth of a continental
African Internet infrastructure. A third
project concerns the African Virtual
Campus. With funding from the
European Commission, AfDB, Spain and
Japan, UNESCO is establishing virtual
campuses at universities in 15 West
African countries. A 10 000 km-long
submarine fibre-optic multipoint cable
system is also under construction. Last
but not least, a project led by the World
Health Organization is lending support
to telemedicine in Africa.

As concerns the exploration of
inner space, Global Monitoring for
Environment and Security (GMES) is a
European initiative for the
establishment of a European capacity
for Earth observation. The GMES and
Africa project was launched by the
Maputo Declaration, signed on 

15 October 2006. The initiative aims to
develop infrastructure for a more
coherent exploitation of Earth
observation data, technologies and
services in support of the
environmental policies put in place in
Africa. An Action Plan is due to be
submitted to the next European–
Union–African Union Summit in 2010.
It is being prepared by the GMES and
Africa Coordination Group, composed
of seven members from Europe and
seven from Africa. Among the
proposed projects, one known as
Kopernicus-Africa will focus on the use
of remote-sensing satellites for African
Global Monitoring for Environmental
and Security. A second project will
build capacity within the African Union
Commission to use the geospatial
sciences for a range of applications that
include natural resources management,
food security and crisis management.

GMES is an EU Joint Technology Initiative,
see page 163

A number of countries have adopted ICT policies in recent
years, including Nigeria, South Africa and Uganda.
However, Internet connectivity remains extremely low
(Figure 4). In Nigeria, just 6.8% of the population had
access to Internet in 2007. Nevertheless, this represented a
leap from 0.3% in 2002. Progress has been slower in South
Africa, where connectivity grew from 6.7% to 8.2% over the
same period. Progress has also been slow in Uganda,
where just 0.4% of the population had access in 2002 and
2.5% four years later. 

The launch of the Nigerian satellite NigComSat-1 in 2007
should offer Africa better telecommunications in future. There
is also a host of international initiatives to help Africa develop
its information infrastructure. Among these, perhaps one of
the most ambitious is the EU-Africa Partnership (Box 3).

The brain drain syndrome
The continent’s growing sustainability problem will 
never be solved by outside experts, despite their good
intentions. How then can sub-Saharan Africa nurture and
sustain the home-grown scientific talents it needs for
problem-solving scientific research? Indubitably, the most
worrying phenomenon for Africa is brain drain, both
internal and external.

A statement on Brain Drain in Africa submitted by the
Network of African Science Academies (Box 4) to the
G8+5 Summit in July 2009 indicates that at least one-
third of African scientists and technologists live and work
in developed countries. Key factors encouraging brain
drain include the paltry funding of education, poor
incentives for research and innovation, political and

religious crises, a lack of adequate regulations to protect
intellectual property and, most importantly, a poor
reward system for researchers, teachers and
technologists working in research institutions and
universities. These are the factors that have pushed
native scientists to migrate to the comfortable zones of
the developed world. The overriding issue should not be
how to lure African expatriates back home but rather
how to transform brain drain into brain gain by
improving conditions at home.

Uganda figures in the top ten among developing
countries for the rate of loss of university-educated
citizens: 36% (ATPS, 2007). Medical doctors and
researchers are leading this exodus. Uganda’s national
report on the economy for financial year 2008, released in
July 2009, shows that remittances from Ugandans
working overseas jumped from US$ 546 million in

2007/2008 to US$ 748 million a year later. Poor pay – even
by East African standards – is inciting many Ugandan
professionals to leave the country in search of greener
pastures. Uganda’s health and education sectors have
been badly hit as a result. In presenting the national
budget for 2010/2011 in June 2010, President Yoweri
Kaguta Museveni announced a 30% hike in scientists’
salaries, with a budget of 18 billion Ugandan shillings 
(US$ 8 million) [Nordling 2010c].

Uganda also faces internal brain drain. A tracer study
carried out in Uganda by UNCHE (2006) targeted 
1 000 graduates fresh out of university to determine how
long it would take them to find gainful employment.
The public sector took on only 32% of graduates, the
great majority (53%) finding employment in the private
sector. Among degree-holders, graduates in veterinary
medicine and social sciences waited longest – more than

Box 4: The Network of African Science Academies

The Network of African Science
Academies was established in
December 2001. It strives to accelerate
the pace at which its member
academies implement best practices, in
order to equip them to advise their
governments on STI policy reform.
Currently, the consortium has 16
national members, plus the African
Academy of Sciences.

Founded in Nairobi in 1986, the

African Academy of Sciences has a dual
mission to honour African achievers in
S&T and mobilize the African S&T
community to promote science-led
development in Africa. Fellows of the
African Academy of Science work
together in a transdisciplinary manner
to tackle many of Africa’s
developmental problems. Through the
African Academy of Sciences, they
conduct R&D and disseminate the
results, organize training and undertake
public advocacy.

Sub-Saharan Africa 

nine months – for a job proposal. The labour market was
observed to have an inadequate supply of medical
doctors, engineers, information technology specialists
and science teachers but was saturated with arts
graduates, social workers and those with backgrounds in
finance and accounting. An analysis of jobs advertised in
the most widely circulated newspapers in Uganda for the
period 2002–2004 found a low percentage of science-
based opportunities, the majority of jobs advertised
being in the service sector.

Uganda is not the only country to have taken energetic
steps recently to improve its reward system. In early
2009, the Government of Cameroon used the 
writing-off of part of its debt to create a permanent fund
of 4.2 billion Central African francs (CFA, almost 
US$ 9.5 million) to boost the salaries of university
lecturers and researchers. Senior lecturers saw their
monthly salary triple overnight to US$1 600. Within a
year, the number of academics receiving the
supplementary allowance had swollen from 1 800 to
more than 2 500, suggesting that the scheme was
already luring scientists back home. One spin-off of the
scheme has been a rise in the number of scientific
articles produced by state universities (Mvondo, 2010). 

In November 2007, Zambia announced the
reintroduction of allowances for academic staff at state
universities to make salaries more competitive with
those of researchers in other African countries. Other
incentives to curb brain drain presented by the Ministry
of Education include higher grants for academic
research, home loans for academic staff and a first in
Zambia: funding for the journals published by the
University of Zambia and Copperbelt University
(Ngandwe, 2007). In 2008, Zambia received a    
US$ 30 million loan from the African Development Bank
(AfDB) to support teaching and research at the
University of Zambia and to provide postgraduate
fellowships to some 300 students majoring in science
and engineering. At the African Union Summit in 2007,
President Levy Patrick Mwanawasa proclaimed that
building capacity in ‘science and technology is the only
means to develop the country.’

Another example is Botswana. One of the strongest
economies in Africa, Botswana was spending millions 
of dollars each year to support approximately 
7 000 Botswanans studying at universities abroad. 

In order to staunch the haemorrhage of students 
leaving the country, Parliament approved plans for 
the Botswana International University of Science and
Technology in January 2006. Construction of the
university began in April 2009 on a 250-hectare site 
in the city of Palapye, 270 km north of Gaborone. 
A public–private partnership, the university will 
focus on engineering, mining, geology and basic 
sciences. Due to open in 2011, it will initially house
laboratories and residences for 250 students. 
A research park is planned for a later stage (Makoni 
and Scott, 2009).

Borrowing a model from football
If inadequate ICT infrastructure and poor scientific
networks and exchanges are a barrier to the circulation 
of expertise within the continent – not to mention the
language barrier between French-, English- and
Portuguese-speaking Africans – African scientists and
engineers also face a physical barrier, the sheer difficulty
in travelling freely around the continent. The question 
of African countries easing immigration regulations and
procedures in order to facilitate the mobility of
international experts, and African expatriates in 
particular, has figured repeatedly on the agenda of
African Union summits without ever being resolved.

A workshop organized by the African Technology Policy
Studies Network in Nairobi, Kenya, in March 2010 came
up with a novel idea for turning brain drain into
temporary brain gain. It suggested that African
governments should borrow the model of the
International Federation of Association Football (FIFA) 
for African researchers and scientists working abroad. 
The FIFA model entitles foreign football clubs to release
their players to play for their home countries during 
major events like the African Nations Cup. 
The ‘fifarization’ of African scientists and researchers
working abroad would entitle them by law to return 
to their home countries if the occasion presented 
itself and to request permission to participate 
occasionally in charting the way forward for their
country’s development in STI. Once their mission was
accomplished, they would return to their home base. 
In this way, a team of medical professionals working in 
the USA and Europe, for instance, could travel to their
home country in Africa once in a while to share their
knowledge and skills. This idea has been enthusiastically
received in various STI fora in Africa.

UNESCO SCIENCE REPORT 2010

A similar approach to tackling brain drain in Africa has been
proposed by the Network of African Science Academies. 
In their statement submitted to the G8+5 Summit in July
2009, the academies recognize the opportunities offered by
the African diaspora and call for new policies to harness
their knowledge and expertise to driving scientific and
economic progress in Africa, as Nigeria has been doing 
(see page 311). This approach turns the phenomenon long
perceived as a one-way flow out of Africa into a two-way
interaction through joint projects between Africa’s emigrant
researchers and home-based scientific communities.
Developed countries are asked to contribute by helping to
improve Africa’s S&T infrastructure, fostering North–South
scientific co-operation and by promoting policies that allow
scientists greater mobility across borders.

The statement proposes five measures for tackling brain
drain:

■ Investing in the rebuilding of universities and research
centres in Africa to enable African scientists to engage
in world-class research without having to emigrate;

■ Extending financial support to young African scientists

to pursue postgraduate and postdoctoral training at
universities in Africa and in developing countries
elsewhere;

■ Launching regional and international centres of

excellence in Africa in areas of study of critical
importance to Africa’s development, especially with
regard to the Millennium Goals. These centres should
promote international collaboration in solving global
problems relevant to Africa;

■ Broadening efforts to encourage Africa’s diaspora to

participate in initiatives to address critical science-
based issues on the continent and to engage African
scientists in joint projects. To this end, policies may be
devised to encourage short-term visits and
collaborative projects involving Africa’s scientific
diaspora and scientists who have remained in their
home countries; expanding North–South scientific
exchange; and developing a database of highly
qualified Africans in the diaspora.

■ Honouring the commitment made by G8+5 countries

at the 2005 G8 Summit, based on the
recommendations of the Commission for Africa’s

296

publication, Our Common Interest, which called on its
members to provide US$ 5 billion to help rebuild
universities and US$ 3 billion to help establish centres
of scientific excellence in Africa.

Socializing science 
Last but not least, there is a need to domesticate S&T in
Africa. All key stakeholders must be involved through
national dialogue in the policy formulation and
implementation process, so as to transcend policies that
tend to be too narrowly focused on a handful of isolated,
ill-equipped and underpaid researchers and
academicians. This will contribute to moving away from
elitist policies and to defining and strengthening the
respective role of public institutions, international
partners, universities, NGOs, women’s organizations, civil
society and the private sector (UNECA, 2005). It will also
ensure that policies are tailored primarily to meeting the
specific needs of end-users and clients. In this regard, the
fight against illiteracy should aim to give girls and boys
the same chances of being empowered through S&T. 

Various means should be employed to promote science
popularization and to ensure that information on S&T
reaches all the relevant stakeholders, via such media as
science centres and museums, radio programmes for
farmers, media-training for scientists, public libraries with
a focus on S&T, booklets and other printed materials,
school science days, inter-school science competitions,
public lectures, science fairs, academies and associations,
adult education, demonstration centres, national merit
awards in science, science quizzes, science newsletters,
exhibitions, science clubs, science festivals, etc.

Kenya’s National Council for Science and Technology is
working with the African Technology Policy Studies
Network on a project entitled Science, Ethics and
Technological Responsibility in Developing and Emerging
Countries (SETDEV) in the context of the European
Union’s Seventh Framework Programme for Research and
Technological Development. The broad objective of this
project is to help an emerging economy (India) and a
developing country (Kenya) to elaborate their own
perspective on the socialization of research. The National
Council for Science and Technology is involved in the
development of a Handbook on the Socialization of
Science and Technological Research in Kenya, the findings
of which may feed into the implementation plans for the
country’s Kenya Vision 2030 (see page 306).

A REGIONAL STRATEGY FOR
DEVELOPING STI IN AFRICA
Africa’s Science and Technology Consolidated Plan 
of Action
We have seen from the previous section that wide
disparities remain in the level of investment in R&D and
scientific productivity between South Africa and the rest
of sub-Saharan Africa, with only a handful of countries
producing a meaningful volume of publications.
However, there are also wide disparities in economic
terms, with a large share of the African population being
excluded from STI dividends. Inequalities in income
distribution have destroyed internal demand for
manufactured goods, in turn inhibiting the learning
process of enterprises. These factors have also had huge
repercussions for the brain drain of scientists and other
qualified personnel.

One of the most ambitious strategies in recent years for
strengthening STI in Africa has been the adoption of
Africa’s Science and Technology Consolidated Plan of Action
for 2008–2013 (CPA). The fact that countries are at
different stages of developing a national STI policy makes
it all the more difficult to establish a common policy for
Africa. It has been suggested in many fora that one way to
give such a process a kick is to attempt a regional STI
policy that will eventually key into the continent-wide
action plan. The CPA is a framework for channelling
investment into S&T in Africa. It was adopted in 2005 by
the continent's science ministers with buy-in from
development aid agencies and is overseen by AMCOST.
Apart from providing a list of projects, the CPA outlines
flagship R&D programmes in four areas: biosciences;
water; materials science and manufacturing; and ICTs.
Italso co-ordinates science aid and has put a stop to the
tradition of donors cherry-picking projects to suit their
own agenda (Nordling, 2010a).

In January 2007, heads of state and government invited
UNESCO to work closely with the African Union and
NEPAD secretariat to implement the CPA, in the
Declaration adopted at the African Union summit in Addis
Ababa. Later the same year, UNESCO adopted its own
African Science, Technology and Innovation Policy
Initiative for 2008–2013 to accompany this process.   
This initiative involves an assessment of the status of S&T
policy formulation in Africa, the provision of technical
advice and support for national STI policy reviews, 

Sub-Saharan Africa 

the development of common African STI indicators, the
creation of an African STI observatory and the launch of a
pilot science park in Africa.

Five years after the CPA's adoption, several donor agencies
are disappointed with progress, with some even going so
far as to declare it dead (Nordling, 2010a). Development
experts also say that fewer national-level policy-makers
support the CPA than when the plan was first agreed
upon. It has been noted that the CPA's proposed
mechanism for channelling donor funding, the African
Science and Innovation Facility, has not materialized. 
That notwithstanding, ‘the CPA is still the framework for
S&T activities on the continent,’ observes Aggrey Ambali,
advisor on S&T within NEPAD (Nordling, 2010a).
Considerable progress has effectively been made on
several individual programmes within the CPA,
particularly in biosciences and water research. In addition,
the CPA will have met another of its goals when one of its
key elements, the African Science and Technology
Indicators Initiative (ASTII), delivers its first set of pan-
African R&D statistics in June 2010. Having taken over 
the reins of AMCOST in March 2010, Egypt should now
champion a reintroduction of the original expectations 
in the CPA. 

It has been suggested that three things are needed to
revive the CPA: firstly, its implementation needs to refocus
on results and co-ordination; secondly, it needs the African
Union and NEPAD to show leadership; and thirdly, it needs
a political and financial buy-in from African countries.

Another impediment to regional integration is the 
lack of dialogue, collaboration, co-ordination and
harmonization among various initiatives designed to
promote S&T across the continent. These initiatives include
the African Science Academy Development Initiative 
(Box 5), UNESCO’s African Science, Technology and
Innovation Policy Initiative, the Knowledge Management
Africa project (Box 6) and NEPAD’s Science and Technology
programme. 

Also hampering regional co-operation and integration is
the prevalence of micro-nationalism, which causes rivalry.
Each country is keen to house every institution within its
own borders rather than creating centres of excellence on
the basis of the comparative advantages of each. There
are existing international centres in Africa on which new
centres could be modelled. The International Centre of

UNESCO SCIENCE REPORT 2010

Box 5: The African Science Academy Development Initiative

The African Science Academy
Development Initiative (ASADI) is a 
10-year endeavour to empower African
science academies to act as efficient
partners in the policy-development
process. Launched in 2004 with
funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates
Foundation, the initiative is managed
by the US National Academies of
Science, through the Board on African
Science Academy Development at the
Institute of Medicine in Washington DC. 

ASADI works with African

academies of science to develop and
implement mechanisms for providing
independent, apolitical and evidence-
based advice to their national
governments. ASADI supports capacity-
building at the science academies of
Nigeria, South Africa and Uganda.
Partnering with these academies via a
grants system helps to develop
infrastructure, personnel, the
relationship between each academy

and its national government, as well as
rigorous procedures for the provision of
policy advice. The grant also provides
some support to the academies of
Cameroon, Ghana, Kenya, Senegal and
to the regional African Academy of
Sciences, in particular for strategic
planning. It is expected that the
initiative will be extended to academies
in other African countries. 

ASADI has already promoted

strong collaboration among African
academies, research institutes,
universities and other S&T institutions. It
is also fostering co-operation between
the African academies and the Royal
Society of Canada, Royal Society of the
United Kingdom and the Royal
Netherlands Academy of Science.

In addition to capacity-building, the

initiative strives to inform African
government policy-making and public
discourse on issues related to the
amelioration of human health and all

development sectors. In this way, it
aims to foster a deeper appreciation on
the part of African governments of the
benefits of decision-making based on
evidence and analysis. 

Every year, the ASADI Board

organizes an international conference
on a specific issue of great importance
to Africa. This event brings together US
and African representatives of science
academies, policy-makers and experts
on the specific topic under discussion.
These meetings place special emphasis
on what academies in Africa can do to
make an impact on policy pertinent to
the relevant issue. In previous years, the
conferences have focused on food
security, water, health and on achieving
the Millennium Development Goals.

Box 6: Knowledge Management Africa 

Knowledge Management Africa (KMA)
is an African initiative launched by the
Development Bank of Southern Africa
in February 2005. On the premise that
knowledge should be the engine that
drives appropriate development
solutions for Africa, KMA sets out to
improve governance and service
delivery in Africa through the creation,
sharing, dissemination and utilization of
knowledge. 

KMA facilitates research by

mobilizing resources and by linking
basic and applied research on the
continent and beyond. It encourages
co-operation between universities,
research institutes and other specialized

institutions, in order to create a pool of
African expertise on specific challenges
for development.

Every two years, KMA hosts an

international conference to create an
environment conducive to the creation
and sharing of African knowledge
among policy-makers, sector
professionals, researchers, knowledge
management experts, government and
civil society leaders, officials from
international institutions, business
leaders and so on.

The themes of the first three
conferences were: Knowledge to
Address Africa’s Development
challenges (Johannesburg, 2005);

Knowledge to Remobilize Africa
(Nairobi, 2007); and Knowledge to
Reposition Africa in the Global
Economy (Dakar, 2009). At the latter, it
was decided to create the Knowledge
Management Africa Foundation to
ensure the sustainability and
consolidation of the initiative.              
The KMA secretariat is located in

Midran, South Africa, but there are
plans to conduct programmes through
sub-regional chapters.

Insect Physiology and Ecology and the International
Institute for Tropical Agriculture, for example, both enjoy
stable funding and outstanding scientific leadership and
have, over the years, earned international recognition.5

African STI Indicators Initiative
In September 2005, AMCOST established an inter-
governmental committee comprised of relevant national
authorities to develop, adopt and use common indicators
to survey Africa’s development in S&T. This system of
indicators will constitute the mainstay for production of
the African Innovation Outlook, which will report on
developments in STI at the national, regional and
continental levels. The indicators can also be used to
monitor global technological trends, conduct foresight
exercises and determine specific areas for investment. 
An example is the target of a GERD/GDP ratio of 1% for
African countries. 

The intergovernmental committee was given the
following mandate:

I Consider and agree upon common definitions,

indicators and methods for conducting STI surveys.
It will also determine the means of integrating STI
indicators into the African Peer Review Mechanism6;

I Identify and designate competent national authorities

for the gathering and analysis of STI indicators; 

I Design and adopt a work plan for preparing the African

Innovation Outlook;

I Promote the sharing of experiences and information

on national STI surveys;

I Develop, publish and widely disseminate an African STI

Indicators Manual; 

I Consider and agree on the means of establishing and

running an STI observatory;

5.   In June 2010, the International Centre of Insect Physiology and Ecology
developed a collar for cattle which repels tsetse flies. The collar exudes the
synthetic equivalent of the odour of animals that tsetse flies avoid. The flies
transmit trypanosomiasis, a disease which kills up to three million cattle
each year. The European Union has signed a US$ 1.8 million deal with the
centre to trial the collars with Maasai pastoralists in East Africa over the next
three years (Adhiambo, 2010).

6.   This voluntary mechanism was introduced by the African Union in 2005
to help countries improve their governance. Countries develop a self-
assessment report and programme of action, which is then submitted to
the secretariat in South Africa and later publicly released by the country
review team. Countries’ progress in implementing their programme of
action is reviewed in subsequent years. 

Sub-Saharan Africa 

I Participate in international committees and/or

processes on STI indicators. This will involve
establishing formal ties with the OECD and other
regional platforms and programmes for STI indicators; 

I Review national surveys and propose common

policies for promoting STI. 

The committee has been assisted by an expert working
group established by NEPAD. In 2010, this working group
was preparing a document proposing indicators and
guidelines for the conduct of surveys. This document
should form the basis for initiating an intergovernmental
process to enable African countries to agree upon
definitions and methods and, where none exist, to
develop these. 

Since 2008, sub-regional training seminars and
workshops on STI policy-relevant indicators have been
co-organized by UNESCO and the African Union for
English- and French-speaking Africa. The organizers are
also advising on the design of questionnaires, manuals
and documentation for national collection of 
STI data. 

Towards an African STI observatory
For indicators to be used effectively, they must be
embedded in the policy process. This requires interaction
between key stakeholders, including policy-makers and
statisticians. This process of interaction allows each group
to do what it does best, policy analysis and development
on the one hand, survey and questionnaire development
on the other. These are quite different skills but they must
be brought together if the resources available for
indicator production are to be used effectively and
efficiently. In both cases, there may be a need for capacity-
building, which could be addressed by an African
Observatory of Science, Technology and Innovation. In
2010, UNESCO and the African Union were engaged in
discussions on the road map for transforming the African
STI Initiative into a permanent observatory in Equatorial
Guinea, which had volunteered to host the observatory
and pledged US$ 3.6 million (Nordling, 2010b). As part of
the process, UNESCO was preparing a feasibility study for
the African Union in 2010. However, South Africa is also a
contender for the observatory. In the time that it has been
hosting the African STI Indicators Initiative in Midrand, it
has gathered R&D and innovation data from 19 African
countries. The interim observatory is due to deliver its first
set of data in June 2010.

UNESCO SCIENCE REPORT 2010

The observatory will have a mandate for collecting,
storing and disseminating data from the African Union’s
53 member states on everything from R&D expenditure
to the number of PhD students. It will ensure that STI
indicators and methodologies for information-gathering
and validation are standardized across the continent. The
African equivalent of co-ordinating bodies like Eurostat
or the OECD Directorate for Science, Technology and
Industry, it will manage expert committees from African
countries and oversee the collection of national statistics,
in addition to producing manuals and the African
Innovation Outlook. The observatory will also build
capacity through the provision of training, sample survey
instruments and case study templates, as well as practical
advice on the development of country profiles, indicator
reports and the use of indicators in evidence-based policy.

COUNTRY PROFILES 

In the following section, we take a closer look at the
strategies adopted by 14 African countries in recent years
to take up the challenges discussed above. The following
list is by no means exhaustive and is merely intended to
illustrate some of the approaches being adopted by
African countries and the persistent obstacles they face.

Benin
After the change of political regime in Benin in April 2006,
the new government redefined strategic orientations for a
national development policy that would fully recognize
the central role of R&D in the development process. The
aim is to improve higher education and the scientific
research system within a National Policy for Scientific and
Technological Research that takes into consideration the
results of a national consultation – or Etats généraux – on
R&D in 2004. The Benin Minister for Higher Education and
Scientific Research has consequently requested UNESCO’s
support within its African Science, Technology and
Innovation Policy Initiative.

Fully aware of the need for credible, accurate data and
indicators to underpin any policy, the National Directorate for
Scientific and Technical Research (DNRST) launched a study
in 2006 to create databases on research conducted in the
country. The DNRST also initiated the creation of the Benin
Agency for the Enhancement of Research (ABVaR) and a
National Fund for Scientific and Technical Research (FNRST),
together with the adoption of an ethical code for R&D.

300

Like many other African countries, Benin devotes very little
to R&D, although official figures are not available.  The bulk
of financial resources allocated to universities and R&D
institutions goes to salaries and grants for students, leaving
little for research. In addition to budgetary constraints and
organizational problems, R&D in Benin faces a third
challenge: the strain on existing facilities resulting from the
drastic increase in the number of university students. The
student body totalled about 60 000 in the 2006 academic
year but the number of students is expected to rise to 
160 000 by 2015 (Gaillard, 2008). 

Burkina Faso
In Burkina Faso, the Ministry of Secondary and Higher
Education and Scientific Research (MESSRS) is responsible
for S&T policy, with the National Centre for Scientific and
Technological Research (CNRST) acting as the ministry’s
operational arm. The CNRST participates in the
elaboration and implementation of the national S&T
policy and co-ordinates and assesses research
programmes. It also supervises the creation and
management of public research institutes, promotes
research results and oversees the training and promotion
of researchers.

Since the agriculture sector employs more than 90% of
the active population and contributes more than 38% of
GDP, the bulk of resources for R&D goes to agriculture
(Figure 5). Burkina Faso has 11 agricultural research
bodies. Of these, the Institute for Environment and
Agricultural Research (INERA) employs around 60% of the
country’s researchers and absorbs about the same share
of the research budget for agriculture. Burkina Faso has
the highest level of education in Africa in the agriculture
sector, with almost half of researchers holding a PhD
(Stads and Boro, 2004).

In 2006, Parliament passed an important Law on the
Security Regime for Biotechnology in Burkina Faso,
followed by a decree in 2007 defining the mission and
responsibilities of the relevant agencies, including the
Directorate for Studies and Planning (DEP) for the
collection, processing and diffusion of statistics, among
them those on scientific research. However, the DEP
lacked a specific tool for collecting and processing S&T
data. To remedy this, a Memorandum of Understanding
was signed between MESSRS and the UNESCO Institute
for Statistics in 2007 to establish a new scientific
information system by 2009.

Sub-Saharan Africa 

Cameroon
At the time of independence in 1960, Cameroon inherited
an appreciable research infrastructure established during
colonial times but only a small pool of trained Cameroonian
researchers. The research structure remained essentially
agricultural with a focus on plant breeding and crop
protection. Gradually, attention turned from subsistence
crops towards cash crops for export, such as coffee, cocoa,
cotton, rubber and banana. The first institute created by the
new state was the Ecole nationale supérieure d’agronomie. In
1974, the new Council for Higher Education, Science and
Technology was entrusted with the dual tasks of funding
R&D and advising the government on policy issues related
to higher education and R&D. Thanks to oil revenues and a
genuine political will to train scientific elites, Cameroon was
among the first African countries to invest consequent
amounts in research, with funding levels rising from 1
billion CFA in 1976/1977 to almost 10 billion CFA a decade
later. Unfortunately, during this euphoric period, research
was carried out within programmes included in the
country’s five-year development plans, under which each
researcher was simply asked to execute programmes
defined beforehand by the institute in question. Under
such conditions, many researchers participated in
programmes without actually publishing anything.

Today, the Ministry of Higher Education, Scientific Research
and Innovation (MINRESI) is charged with formulating
research policy and programmes in Cameroon. Its main
attributions are to initiate, co-ordinate and assess scientific
research, as well as to promote science popularization and
innovation through the utilization of research results, in
permanent relation with all national economic sectors,

Box 7: Technology transfer in Cameroon

others ministries and interested organizations. The ministry
operates the state research institutes, which include the
Institute of Agronomic Research for Development (IRAD),
the Geological and Mineral Research Institute (IRGM), the
Institute for Medical Research and Medicinal Plant Studies
(IMPM), the National Institute for Mapping (INC) and the
Centre for Energy Research (NERCE) supported by the
International Atomic Energy Agency. Other institutions are
attached to various ministries or are of an international
character with offices in Cameroon. The latter include the
French Institute of Research for Development (IRD), the
Centre for International Cooperation in Agronomic Research
for Development (CIRAD) and the International Institute for
Tropical Agriculture. Moreover, MINRESI launched a Mission
for the Promotion of Local Materials (MIPROMALO) in the
1990s, combining technology transfer, R&D and the
promotion of entrepreneurship (Box 7).

The country’s seven state-owned universities and four
private universities provide the national platform for
education and research. There is a strong demand for
tertiary education, with university enrollment in S&T fields
having increased from 90 000 in 2000 to 150 000 in 2010.
However, the government’s agenda of achieving education
for all might be compromised unless proactive measures
are taken urgently to align education expenditure on the
growing demand for higher education. Nor can private
universities make up the difference, as the high fees they
charge keep student rolls low. 

Cameroon has several specialized journals: the Journal of
the Cameroon Academy of Sciences, the Journal of Health
and Disease, the Journal of Applied Social Sciences,

In the 1990s, the Government of
Cameroon set up the Mission de
promotion des matériaux locaux
(MIPROMALO) to promote the use of
local building materials and thereby
reduce the country’s trade deficit. 

A key mission of this public body,

which answers to the Ministry of 
Higher Education, Scientific Research
and Innovation but is financially
independent, is to set up technology

transfer centres in 10 regions across the
country. 

public–private partnerships. 
It provides the following services: 

MIPROMALO consists of three main

programmes: eco-construction and
development (solar panels, etc);
business creation and development
and gender empowerment; and
education and new technologies.

industrialization of production of local
materials in Cameroon and develops

UNESCO SCIENCE REPORT 2010

Biodiagnostics and Therapy, and a quarterly newsletter
published by the organization responsible for the
surveillance of endemic diseases in Central Africa
(OCEAC), the Bulletin de l’OCEAC. The OCEAC secretariat is
located in Yaoundé and supported by the World Health
Organization. Scientists would be able to access the
content of these journals more easily if they were
registered in standard bibliometric indexes.

One issue of concern is the low output of Cameroonian
scientists. In early 2009, the government showed its
willingness to strengthen university research by creating 
a special fund to triple the salaries of academics from 
US$ 550 to US$ 1 850 per month and modernize research
facilities. This measure has been designed to increase the
productivity of researchers and staunch brain drain. 

The development of R&D has become one of the
government’s priorities, with an annual budget of 3 billion
CFA and an average budgetary growth rate of
approximately 1%. To promote excellence in scientific
research and innovation, MINRESI launched a national
biennial event in October 2007 tagged Journées
d’excellence de la recherche scientifique et de l’innovation du
Cameroun (Days of Excellence in Scientific Research and
Innovation in Cameroon), while working in parallel on a
directory of isolated or independent researchers and a
scientific Research Sectoral Strategy Plan. Major barriers to
the development of STI persist, however. These include: 

I the lack of a national STI policy;
I a policy vacuum on distance learning;
I poor, expensive communication infrastructure;
I institutional inertia towards innovation that fuels a

misuse of funds;

I a scarce, expensive energy supply reliant on fossil fuels

and hydropower that would benefit from heavy
investment in R&D to develop renewable sources of
energy such as biomass, wind and solar energy.

Central African Republic
Statistics on scientists, researchers, engineers and their
programmes are fragmentary in the Central African
Republic, mostly due to latent political instability and
repeated crises. Only the University of Bangui produces a
statistical yearbook and then only with long delays, in
spite of support from the UNESCO Institute for Statistics.
What is certain is that the country lacks a critical mass of
researchers and that the research pool is concentrated at

302

the University of Bangui and the Pasteur Institute situated
in the capital. The small size of the country’s research
body precludes the constitution of any associations of
scientists or engineers. 

Founded in 1970, the University of Bangui is the country’s
only university. The small pool of researchers is mostly
involved in teaching rather than in research, as the
budget for research is negligible. Although a High
Council for Research was established in 1987, 
it is not operational. 

To improve the situation, the government issued a
Decree on the Organization and Functioning of the
Ministry of Education, Literacy, Higher Education and
Research in June 2005. This was followed in May 2006 by
a special Decree on the Creation and Organization of the
Researchers’ Profession. In December of the same year,
the ministry was again the subject of a decree modifying
its statutes. The Decree on the Organization and
Functioning of the Ministry of Education, Literacy, Higher
Education and Research also fixed the minister’s duties. 
In 2010, the ministry was implementing an important
project funded by the French cooperation agency in
support of higher education. Known as SUPC@, this
project includes a number of R&D components.

In response to the government’s request, UNESCO is
currently providing support for the adoption of a national
STI policy under its African Science, Technology and
Innovation Policy Initiative. To that end, a consultant
visited the country in July 2008 and July 2009. Moreover,
a national forum was organized in March 2010 to ensure
shared ownership of the new policy by all relevant
stakeholder groups in the elaboration of a national STI
policy: the research community, public and private
entrepreneurs, civil society, funding agencies and so on.

Republic of Congo
Like Angola, Equatorial Guinea and Nigeria, among others,
the Republic of Congo’s industrial sector is largely
dependent on oil. Oil has supplanted forestry as the
mainstay of the economy, providing a major share of
government revenues and exports. The country was
seriously handicapped by two civil wars in the 1990s and,
more recently, by the fall in global oil prices in 2008. As
a result, it is currently experiencing a severe economic
crisis that is jeopardizing the country’s R&D
programmes. 

Africa [16] [P3]:Layout 1  18/10/10  19:14  Page 303

Although agriculture contributes only about 6% of GDP
and 1% of exports, it is vital for the national economy, as it
employs 40% of the workforce (Figure 5). This makes
agricultural R&D a national priority. However, although
the total number of agricultural researchers in Congo has
gradually increased in recent years, expenditure on
agricultural R&D has fallen by more than half over the
same period. The country’s 11 agricultural research
centres, which fall under the Directorate-General for
Scientific and Technological Research, account for about
two-thirds of expenditure on agricultural R&D. The large
number of these relatively small agricultural research
agencies, however, coupled with their overlapping
mandates, weakens the co-ordination and efficacy of
agricultural research in Congo.

In 2004, the Congolese government requested UNESCO’s
assistance in strengthening national capacities in S&T to
revitalize the science system after all the lost years of the
Congolese civil war. UNESCO has since accompanied this
ongoing effort to reform the country’s science system step
by step, with financial support from the Government of
Japan. In the project’s first stage, a General Report was
prepared in 2004 to assess the state of S&T in Congo, in
close collaboration with national stakeholders from the
public and private sectors. The General Report (UNESCO,
2010b) found that:

I the science governance system was dysfunctional. Some

governance structures existed only in theory and, at
0.13% of GDP, public research funding was well below
the stated target of 1%;

I research institutes, universities and industry remained

isolated from one another and the entire system suffered
from a lack of networking and intersectoral co-operation; 

I the scientific community had no common representative

structure, such as an academy or professional
associations;

I research institutions suffered from a severe shortage of

facilities, equipment, logistics and administrative and
technical personnel; 

I public research was placed under the auspices of the

Ministry of Scientific Research and Technological
Innovation but remained isolated from other sectors,
such as agriculture or industry;

Sub-Saharan Africa 

I since the end of the civil war, Congolese scientists had
enjoyed little interaction and only rare exchanges with
foreign scientists, including limited involvement in
regional and international co-operation; 

I the capacity of science policy-makers and managers

was very low.

Once feedback had been received from officials on the
diagnosis made in the General Report, a series of
recommendations were made on the formulation,
organization and implementation of an S&T policy. 
These were then the object of extensive consultations
before being forwarded to the government in early 
2006. The ‘diagnosis’ was validated and enriched by 
nearly 60 Congolese officials from various stakeholder
groups at a National Policy Forum for Scientific 
Research and Technological Innovation organized in
Brazzaville in May 2007. A series of seminars and training
sessions on such themes as the governance of S&T and
innovation policies followed in Brazzaville (UNESCO,
2010b).

Since 2005, the project has resulted in (UNESCO, 2010b):

I the creation of a full-fledged ministry responsible for

scientific research and technological innovation in
January 2005 to deal with an area that had previously
come under the responsibility of the Ministry for
Higher Education;

I the establishment of a Directorate for Technological

Innovation within the new ministry;

I the development of specific statutes for research

workers which were in the final stages of adoption in
2010, under consideration by the Supreme Court;

I a reform of the research infrastructure which was still

under way in 2010, in order to group the large number
of research units within three major institutes, those for
agricultural sciences, health sciences and exact and life
sciences;

I reconstruction of several research facilities and the

allocation of greater resources to strategic areas, such
as the National Agency for the Enhancement of
Research (Agence nationale de valorisation de la
recherche);

■ the establishment of a postgraduate school at the

Marien Ngouabi University, supported by the
university’s Centre for Information Technology (Campus
numérique de l’Université Marien Ngouabi);

■ the elaboration and approval in April 2009 of a science

policy document and an action plan for research and
innovation covering 2010–2013. The action plan
reiterates the 1% target for the GERD/GDP ratio.
Specific research priorities have been defined, such as
human and animal health; food security; and
environment and biodiversity. These are in keeping
with the major objectives of the country’s
development policy; 

■ the inclusion of a chapter on S&T in President Denis

Sassou-Nguesso’s Vision document for Congolese
society, covering 2009–2016, entitled Le Chemin
d’Avenir. 

The first project phase wound up in 2010. For the second
phase, UNESCO is suggesting to the Congolese
government that it undertake the following projects:

■ review of research institutions;
■ the development of an STI financing system; 
■ the strengthening of human resources in science

policy;

■ the launch of a sub-regional parliamentary forum on

the role of STI in socio-economic development;

■ the setting-up of university teaching and research

programmes on STI ;

■ a study on how to develop science and innovation in

the private sector;

■ promotion of innovation and technological entre-

preneurship, taking into account the informal sector;

■ the establishment of an intellectual property

protection system;

■ a review of participation in regional and international

scientific activities.

UNESCO has also recommended that the budgeting
process be adjusted to allow for a multi-year budgetary
programming cycle with a long-term vision, accompanied
by greater flexibility in the use of funds. It proposes that
the Directorate General for Scientific and Technological
Research fulfil the essential role of co-ordination and
supervision, in close partnership with the Ministry of
Finance. UNESCO is also urging the scientific community

Sub-Saharan Africa 

to organize itself into fully representative bodies, such as
one or more academies or associations. The scientific
community is currently too fragmented to play the role of
partner in a permanent process of interaction with the
state authorities and civil society (UNESCO, 2010b). 

Côte d’Ivoire
Côte d’Ivoire was a paragon of stability and economic
growth in West Africa from the time of independence in
1960 until 2002 when a severe political crisis degenerated
into civil war. This situation practically partitioned the
country and completely jeopardized economic growth,
paralysing scientific progress in the process. As a result,
Côte d’Ivoire produced 129 publications in 2000 but only
111 in 2002. By 2008, productivity had recovered to 
171 but the growth rate was well below that of Uganda, 
a country with comparable output in 2000. International
collaboration was likewise affected. Côte d’Ivoire’s
scientists co-authored 103 articles in 2000 and 84 in 2002,
a number that had risen to 115 by 2008.

One consequence of the political crisis has been the
extreme difficulty in collecting and processing statistical
data, since the second National Strategy Document for
Statistics Development (2001–2005) was never adopted by
the government and its successor for 2007–2010 was still
being finalized in 2010. 

Cote d'Ivoire is the world's largest producer and exporter
of cocoa beans and a key exporter of coffee and palm oil.
Despite government attempts to diversify the economy to
reduce its vulnerability to international prices and climatic
conditions, the country remains heavily dependent on
agriculture (CIA, 2010). The National Centre for Agronomic
Research (CNRA) employs two-thirds of the country’s
researchers and absorbs three-quarters of R&D
expenditure. 

CNRA has benefited from significant funding from the
World Bank within two successive National Agricultural
Services Support Projects for 1994–1997 and 1998–2010.
CNRA has also attracted funding from the African
Development Bank, United Nations Development
Programme and the co-operation agencies of France and
Belgium. It has established bilateral co-operation with the
private sector via contracts with the African Sugar
Company (SUCAF), the Ivorian Company for Textile
Development (CIDT) and the Ivorian Cotton Company
(ICCI), among others.

UNESCO SCIENCE REPORT 2010

Democratic Republic of Congo (Kinshasa) 
Endowed with rich agricultural soils, dense forests, abundant
water and large reserves of minerals, this large country with
enormous potential was devastated by almost uninterrupted
civil war, rebellions and armed conflict between the time of
independence in 1960 and the government signing of peace
agreements with various rebel groups in March 2009. As a
result of this prolonged political instability, the country’s
economy is in ruins: GDP amounted to just PPP US$ 20 billion
in 2008. Scientific productivity is negligible, with just 
30 publications registered in Thomson Reuters’ Science
Citation Index in 2008, although the language barrier may
explain, in part, this poor performance. 

The Democratic Republic of Congo has a small research
infrastructure. Of the country’s 25 public research centres
and institutes, 18 fall under the Ministry of Scientific and
Technological Research and seven under other ministries.
There are also 19 institutions of tertiary education and 
13 research centres and institutes in the higher education
sector. The main private R&D institutions are the Luozi
Pharma ceutical Research Centre (CRPL), Pan-African
Research Development Institute (IRDA), African Centre for
Industrial Research (CARI) and the Congolese Centre for
Strategic Studies and Research specializing in international
relations.

In May 2005, the country organized the Etats généraux for
scientific research. This national forum brought together
different stakeholder groups to draft a strategic plan for
S&T and gave orientations for the future, including for the
periodic assessment of the research system.

In 2008, the Democratic Republic of Congo requested
UNESCO’s assistance in developing a national S&T policy.
This process is being conducted by the Ministry of
Scientific and Technological Research, together with the
National Scientific Council (CSN).

Gabon 
Gabon is among the richest countries in Africa, thanks
mainly to exports of petroleum, manganese, uranium and
wood. Some 85% of the country is covered by dense forest.
With its natural resources deteriorating, however, more
importance is now being given to agriculture, although
Gabon’s agricultural R&D capacity remains one of the
weakest on the continent. Three agricultural research
institutes account for more than three-quarters of the
country’s total R&D staff and expenditure.

306

The Ministry of Higher Education, Research and
Technological Innovation is entrusted with the 
mission of planning, promoting and assessing R&D
programmes, as well as capacity-building. The ministry
has signed an agreement with the French Cooperation
Mission to develop a Research Directory Scheme in
Gabon. This could boost scientific production, which is
globally very low: in 2008, Gabonese scientists authored
just 76 of the papers recorded in the Science Citation
Index.

Besides the National Council for Higher Education and
Scientific Research (CONAREST) and the three national
universities – Omar Bongo University, the Science and
Technology University of Masuku and the University of
Health Sciences – Gabon’s main research institutions are
the National Centre for Scientific and Technological
Research (CENAREST), the Centre for Specialized
University Research (CERESU), the International Medical
Research Centre of Franceville (CIRMF) and the
Schweitzer Foundation Medical Research Laboratory. 

Research programmes are mostly conducted within
teams participating in international or sub-regional
collaborative networks, such as with Europe (28.6%),
North America (8.6%), the Economic and Monetary
Community of Central Africa (17.1 %) and the Economic
Community of West African States (12.4 %). In 2007, just
57 scientific articles resulted from international
collaboration in S&T. However, 22% of researchers have
never published within international networks and,
more worrisome still, 14% of researchers have never
published at all in the course of their career.

Kenya
Kenya is the regional hub for trade and finance in 
East Africa. Kenya’s economy suffered in early 2008,
after post-election violence affected tourism and
investor confidence. This situation, coupled with the
drop in exports and remittances as a result of the
global recession, has caused annual GDP growth to
slip from 7% in 2007 to barely 2% in 2008 and 2009 
(CIA, 2010).

Against this backdrop, the Kenyan president decided to
establish a new science ministry in 2008 by merging the
Ministry of Science and Technology with the
Department of Higher Education. The resultant Ministry
of Higher Education, Science and Technology plans to

Africa [1] [Ed2]:Layout 1  25/11/10  12:44  Page 307

Sub-Saharan Africa 

strengthen the linkages between higher education and
research. The Kenyan Parliament has since approved a
national policy for biotechnology devised by the ministry
(Box 8).

adopted a policy of centralizing research. There is one
main agricultural R&D agency, the Rural Economy
Institute, which groups roughly 85% of the country’s
agricultural researchers and expenditure. 

The government announced a Kenya Vision 2030 in
June 2008. This document calls for a series of five-year
plans for the country’s economic development. The
first plan covers 2008–2012 and identifies six key
sectors for investment with 20 flagship projects. These
sectors are: tourism, agriculture, manufacturing, trade,
information technology and financial services. 

Concerned at the impact of climate change on the
environment, the government allocated US$ 721 million
to conservation in 2010 and announced plans to
establish a regional carbon emissions trading scheme.
The government is hopeful that such a scheme will
attract funding to Kenya and add regional carbon trading
hub to Kenya’s established role as a regional hub for trade
and finance. Most of the US$ 721 million allocated to
conservation – a rise of more than 50% over the previous
year’s budget – will go to the environment, water and
sanitation sectors (Mboya, 2010).

Mali
A landlocked country, Mali has suffered droughts,
rebellions, coups and a brief border war with Burkina
Faso in recent years. Endowed with a democratically
elected civilian government since 1992, Mali still faces
sporadic fighting with nomadic Tuareg tribes in the
north. The country is saddled with a chronic foreign trade
deficit and an economy largely dependent on cotton
production. The low level of resources allocated to STI has
spawned a small pool of ageing researchers who often
lack motivation. 

Since 2000, the national budget has allocated an annual
grant of approximately €1 200 000 (circa US$ 1.8 million)
to studies and research. In addition, a special budget for
investment of 600 million CFA (about US$ 1.2 million) 
was allocated each year from 2005 to 2007 for the
rehabilitation and equipping of laboratories in 
universities and secondary schools.

As elsewhere in Africa, agricultural research predominates
in Mali. It is thus hardly surprising that it is one of the
priorities of Mali’s Strategic Plan for 2010–2019. Mali differs
from many other African countries, however, in that it has

In addition to government contributions, the Rural
Economy Institute is largely dependent on funding
from the National Agricultural Research Project and the
Support Programme for Agricultural Services and
Associations of Producers (PASAOP), drawn
predominantly from World Bank loans and funding
from the Netherlands through the Rural Economy
Institute Support Project (PAPIER). PASAOP ended in
December 2009 but has been replaced by another
programme supporting agricultural productivity in Mali
(PAPAM).

Private-sector involvement in funding agricultural
research on cotton, rice and other crops is limited to
the Malian Company for Textile Development and the
Niger Office. However, research institutions generate
some income of their own through the
commercialization of research products or services.

Despite a research environment lacking in everything
from infrastructure and equipment to a well-trained,
motivated young labour force, Malian research has
managed to innovate, in particular in the agriculture
and health sectors. Scientists have developed new
varieties of maize, millet, rice and cowpea that are
drought- and pest-resistant, as well as new techniques
to increase yields. They have also developed traditional
medicines and vaccines. 

Scientific authorship remains low, however. Just 
88 scientific articles from Mali were recorded in the
Science Citation Index in 2008, although this was up
from 30 in 2000. There was a similar level of
productivity in international collaboration in 2008, with
Malian scientists co-authoring 81 articles. 

Today, there is a perceptible political will to support STI.
The government has set up 18 national research
institutes co-ordinated by the National Centre for
Scientific and Technological Research (CNRST).
Established in March 2004 under the Ministry of Higher
Education and Scientific Research, CNRST manages the
budget line for Studies and Research. This budget line
leapt from 9 million CFA in 2000 to 60 million CFA in 2009.

UNESCO SCIENCE REPORT 2010

In Mali, agricultural research is co-ordinated by the
National Committee for Agricultural Research (CNRA).
Health research, on the other hand, is the purview of the
National Institute for Public Health Research (INRSP).

The University of Bamako was founded in January 2006
to take over from the University of Mali. It counts five
faculties and two institutes. Other institutions employed
in R&D and training are the: Central Veterinary Laboratory;

Box 8: Africa invests in biotech

Just three months after discovering
Cuba’s drug manufacturing capacity
during a visit to the country, so the
story goes, former South African
President Thabo Mbeki announced
South Africa’s first National
Biotechnology Strategy in 2001.
Several regional and one national
biotechnology innovation centres
followed, the role of which was to
recruit venture capitalists and distribute
federal funds to start-ups. In just a few
years, South Africa’s biotech strategy
has doubled the number of biotech
companies to more than 80 and
created more than 1 000 research jobs.
Biotech products in development
nearly doubled from 900 in 2003 to
more than 1 500 in 2007 and the
industry reported over US$ 100 million
in revenue in 2006.

This novel approach has become
the hallmark of biotech R&D in Africa.
Rather than relying on big
pharmaceutical companies for
investment, a growing number of
African governments are funding
biotech themselves via support for
start-ups, partnerships with
foundations and United Nations
agencies, and R&D collaborations
between universities and private
laboratories. The Wellcome Trust’s
African Institutions initiative is investing
US$ 50 million in training researchers in
neglected tropical diseases and in
sponsoring collaboration between
50 scientific institutions in 18 African
countries and private companies.

The World Health Organization is also
pouring US$ 30 million annually into
research and bringing biotech products
to the market within the African
Network for Drugs and Diagnosis
Innovation that it has helped to
establish.

In 2004, the Kenyan government

decided to invest US$ 12 million to
build a‘biosafety greenhouse’to allow
containment of genetically modified
(GM) crops, in a project funded jointly
by the government and the Swiss
Syngenta Foundation. Kenya thereby
became the second sub-Saharan
country after South Africa to be
equipped to conduct GM experiments
that conform to international biosafety
standards. The greenhouse has been
built within the Insect-Resistant Maize
for Africa project. The greenhouse was
developed jointly by the Kenya
Agricultural Research Institute and the
International Center for Maize and
Wheat Research (CIMMYT), which also
trained scientists to manage the facility
at its centre in Mexico.

In 2007, the Kenya Wildlife Service
concluded a five-year biotech research
partnership with the Danish company
Novozymes to use enzymes with
potential industrial applications in
biofuels and medicine, in particular. In
return for authorizing Novozymes to
exploit rich microbial biodiversity
commercially within areas under its
control, the Kenya Wildlife Service is
collaborating with Novozymes in
enzyme R&D and patenting.

Novozymes is also assisting with
transfer technology to Kenya and is
training Kenyan students to turn plants,
animals, insects and micro-organisms
into marketable goods. The company
has agreed to build a special laboratory
at the Kenya Wildlife Service
headquarters in Nairobi. Kenya passed
a biosafety bill in 2009.

Burkino Faso passed its own

biosafety bill in 2006. Two years later,
Uganda’s Cabinet approved the
country’s first national biotechnology
and biosafety policy. Uganda is
currently using a US$30 million loan
from the World Bank to improve the
cassava plant.

Nigeria established a National

Biotechnology Development Agency
(NABDA) in 2001 as an institutional
framework for implementing the
National Biotechnology Policy. At a
roundtable organized by NABDA in
April 2008 on the introduction of GM
crops into Nigeria, participants‘noted
the undue delay in the processing of
the Nigerian biosafety bill’and urged
‘the [relevant ministers] to fast-track the
process to obtain National Assembly
approval without further delay.’
NABDA has designated six zonal
biotechnology centres of excellence for
the conduct of R&D corresponding to
specific biotechnology problems within
each zone. The biosafety bill has been
before parliament since 2009.

Rural Economy Institute mentioned above; Traditional
Medicine Research Centre (CRMT); National Agency for
Telemedicine and Medical Computing (ANTIM) and; Rural
Polytechnic Institute/ Institute for Training and Applied
Research of Katibougou (IPR/IFRA).

The Ministry of Industry holds a National Invention and
Innovation Exhibition every two years, through the
National Directorate for industry (DNI) and the Malian
Centre for Industrial Property (CEMAPI).

A wide range of laws and decrees have been adopted in
recent years to improve the legal framework for S&T. Of note
are those establishing a Statute for Researchers (2000) and
new institutions, or fixing the functioning modalities of
existing institutions. One product of this legislative onslaught
is the National Agency for Information and Communication
Technologies (AGETIC) dating from January 2005. One of the
first tasks for AGETIC was to conduct a study, in June 2005, for
the establishment of a National Policy on Information and
Communication Technologies, with support from UNECA,
the European Commission and the United Nations
Development Programme.

In 2010, Mali was in the process of formulating a national
STI policy with a strong focus on innovation, with UNECA
support.

Nigeria
With the return to democracy in 1999 after 15 years of
military rule, the role of STI in driving development
started to feature prominently in Nigeria’s economic
reform agenda. In 2001, President Obasanjo appointed an
International Honorary Presidential Advisory Council on
Science and Technology to advise him on:

I effective ways of developing S&T for the benefit of

Nigerians, by enhancing capacities in such critical areas
as biotechnologies, ICTs, space science and technology,
energy, nanotechnology and mathematics;

The Council met twice a year for nearly seven years and
made several important recommendations in the areas
described above. 

Under the presidency of Olusegan Obasanjo (1999–2007),
the National Economic Empowerment and Development
Strategy (NEEDS) was adopted to provide a framework for
poverty reduction and wealth creation over the period
2003–2007. It identified STI as a cross-cutting issue, the
promotion of which was vital to achieving economic
objectives. This was followed by a Seven-point Agenda and
Nigeria Vision 20: 2020, which represents the country’s
current economic development policy platform. The
Nigeria Vision 20: 2020 embraces areas identified by 
12 committees set up by the Federal Ministry of Science 
and Technology at the turn of the century. It spans: 

I biotechnology;
I nanotechnology; 
I institutional linkages; 
I capacity-building; 
I renewable energy; 
I venture capital; 
I space research; 
I industry-targeted research by small and medium-sized

enterprises; 

I knowledge-intensive new and advanced materials; 
I STI information management; 
I information and communication technologies; 
I intellectual property rights; 
I traditional medicine and indigenous knowledge. 

The target of the Nigeria Vision 20: 2020 is for Nigeria to join
the 20 most powerful economies in the world by 2020. This
target is based on the assumption that the country will
achieve a consistent 12.5% growth rate in GDP per capita
over the next decade. There are nine strategic targets:

I Carry out a technology foresight programme by the

end of 2010;

I Invest a percentage of GDP in R&D that is comparable

I effective ways of promoting S&T as an instrument for

co-operation and integration in Africa;

to the percentage invested by the 20 leading
developed economies of the world;

I effective capacity-building programmes for

implementation by the Federal Ministry of Science and
Technology, including recourse to the expertise of
Nigerians in the diaspora, and partnerships with
international bodies. 

I Establish three technology information centres and
three R&D laboratories to foster the development of
small and medium-sized enterprises;

I Increase the number of scientists, engineers and
technicians and provide them with incentives to
remain in Nigeria;

UNESCO SCIENCE REPORT 2010

I Support programmes designed by professional S&T

bodies to build STI capacity;

I Develop an STI information management system for the
acquisition, storage and dissemination of research results;

I Attain progressively 30% of local technology content

by 2013, 50% by 2016 and 75% by 2020;

I Develop new and advanced materials as an alternative

to the use of petroleum products;

I Establish a National Science Foundation. 

In October 2004, UNESCO set up an International
Advisory Board for the reform of the Nigerian science
system, at the government’s request. One aim of the
reform process was to diversity Nigeria’s economy, which
had become extremely dependent on fluctuating global
oil prices. The board recommended (UNESCO, 2006):

I establishing a US$ 5 billion Endowment Fund in

Nigeria which would be supplemented by donors;

I creating a National Science Foundation. This would be
an independent funding body for competitive research
and projects and programmes in innovation. Its main
functions would be the provision of grants to research

bodies, universities, enterprises and individuals on a
competitive basis; the equipping and capitalization of
research groups; and the establishment of research
universities;

I creating technology-based ‘good business’ zones in each

state where, for instance, businesses could obtain a license
within 30 days and benefit from reduced capital costs;

I providing six Nigerian universities with targeted

funding and technical assistance to enable them to rank
among the 200 top universities in the world by 2020. 

These four recommendations have since been approved
by the government. Moreover, the proposal to create 
the National Science Foundation has been incorporated
in the Economic Transformation Blue Print for the 
Nigeria Vision 20:20, as we have seen. In 2010, the
government approved a special intervention fund of
US$210 million over three years to develop centres of
excellence at six universities, as well as US$ 66 million for
upgrading selected polytechnics and colleges of
education. Nigeria has 104 approved universities, 27 of
which are federal, 36 state and 41 private universities.

Box 9: African Institutes of Science and Technology

The African University of Science and
Technology in Abuja (AUST), Nigeria,
was established in 2007 by the Nelson
Mandela Institution, a charity
incorporated in the USA, as the first in a
Pan-African Network of Institutes of
Science and Technology and centres of
excellence across the continent. 

AUST started its first academic year

in June 2008. Two years later, the
university was offering five MSc degree
programmes in pure and applied
mathematics; computer science;
applied physics; materials science and;
petroleum engineering. The university
intends to develop its own PhD
programme in the coming years and to
establish strong partnerships with
overseas universities to allow PhD
students to do part of their research
abroad.

The AUST in Arusha, Tanzania, has
six start-up postgraduate programmes.
These are in materials science and
engineering; biosciences and
bioengineering; mathematics and
computational science and
engineering; water and environment
engineering; energy science and
engineering (both renewable and non-
renewable energy); and humanities
and business studies. The latter includes
management and entrepreneurship;
innovation management and
competitiveness; and law and IPRs.
Each AUST intends to become a

world-class research-oriented
institution. In Abuja, the AUST has
developed extensive links with the
African scientific diaspora and
partnerships with the African Institute
of Mathematical Sciences in 

Capetown (South Africa), with the
Indian Institute of Technology Bombay
(India) and with an AUST affiliate centre,
the International Institute for Water and
Environmental Engineering in
Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso). The AUST
in Abuja is also expected to collaborate
with the Nigerians in the Diaspora
Commission established by Parliament
in 2010 to identify Nigerian specialists
living abroad and encourage their
participation in Nigerian policy and
project formulation. Sponsors of the
AUST in Abuja include UNESCO’s Abdus
Salam International Centre for
Theoretical Physics, the African
Development Bank Group and the
Nigerian National Petroleum
Corporation.

Sub-Saharan Africa

In 2010, Parliament approved the establishment of the
Nigerians in the Diaspora Commission, the aim of which is to
identify Nigerian specialists living abroad and encourage
their participation in Nigerian policy and project formulation.
The African University of Science and Technology in Abuja is
expected to collaborate with the Commission on
implementing this project (Box 9).

Priorities for industrial development in Nigeria
Nigeria has about 66 R&D institutes covering various sectors
of the economy. R&D in many of these institutes has
produced a host of nationally patented inventions but the
vast majority remain on the shelf rather than being turned
into innovative products and processes. In line with the
government’s NEEDS strategy and ensuing reforms, the
federal government approved funding for the development
of the Abuja Technology Village in 2007 and established a
project team. This project draws on similar initiatives
worldwide which cluster local and multinational companies,
as well as residential areas. These include Silicon Valley in the
USA, Dubai Internet City, the International Technology Park
in India and Cyberjaya in Malaysia. The main clusters of the
Abuja Technology Village are: minerals technology,
biotechnology, energy technology and ICTs.

The National Biotechnology Development Agency was
established in 2001 as an institutional framework for
implementing the National Biotechnology Policy adopted
the same year. The agency has a mandate to co-ordinate,
promote and regulate all biotechnology activities in the
country with a view to making available this cutting-edge
technology for the promotion of a healthy environment,
ensuring national food security and providing affordable
health care delivery and poverty alleviation. Its development
has been hampered, however, by the delay in the adoption
of a biosafety act to provide a framework for the introduction
and development of GM crops in Nigeria. See Box 8 for
details.

The state of information technology (IT) in Nigeria left
much to be desired at the turn of the century. Technology
and industrial policy regimes had been marked by the
indiscriminate importation of technology in which
transfer agreements contained unfair clauses. These clauses
included monopoly pricing; restrictive business practices;
export restrictions; high royalty rates; tie-in clauses with
equipment, raw materials, components and so on; a lack
of training and management programmes; and poor
opportunities for local R&D.

The elaboration of Nigeria’s National Information
Technology Policy in 2001 sought to reduce Nigeria’s
dependence on imported technology and promote the
country’s global integration to facilitate economic
development. The policy went through a consultative
process that brought together the country’s major IT
stakeholders8. Nigeria created a National Information
Technology Development Agency in 2001 specifically to
implement the IT policy. Six years later, Internet access
had jumped from just 0.3% in 2002 to 6.8%. One area that
merits investment in Nigeria is software development.

In July 2006, the federal government launched the
Computer for All Nigerians Initiative (CANI). This
public–private collaboration is sponsored by the Federal
Ministry of Science and Technology, Microsoft and Intel.
The computers are made with Intel processors and are
assembled locally by International Business Machines,
Hewlett Packard and four Nigerian companies: Omatek,
Zinox, Brian and Beta Computers. The scheme makes
desktop computers and laptops available to employers at
a 30% discount off the market price. It also offers
affordable 24-month bank loans for the purchase of
personal computers (PCs). The loans are guaranteed by
the employer, with instalments being deducted directly
from the employee’s salary. Employers are being
encouraged to subsidize the package by about 20% to
reduce the cost of a PC to half the market price.

In 2003, Nigeria became the third country after South
Africa and Egypt to have a presence in space, after the
launch of a low-orbit remote-sensing micro-satellite,
NigeriaSat-1, with the assistance of the Russian
Federation. NigeriaSat-1 monitors the environment and
provides information for infrastructure development. This
prowess enabled Nigeria to join the Disaster Monitoring
Constellation grouping Algeria, China, the UK and
Viet Nam. NigComSat-1 followed in 2007, in collaboration
with the China Great Wall Industry Corporation, to offer
Africa better telecommunications.

In April 2010, the Nigerian Oil and Gas Industry Content
Development Act (Local Content Act) received
presidential assent. Now in force, the new law seeks to

increase indigenous participation in the oil and gas
industry by prescribing minimum thresholds for the use of
local services and materials and by promoting the
employment of Nigerian staff. The Local Content Act
derives from the Nigerian Content Policy, which seeks to
promote active participation by Nigerians in the petroleum
sector without compromising standards. The policy also
focuses on promoting value addition in Nigeria through
the utilization of local raw materials, products and services
in order to stimulate the growth of endogenous capacity. 

Rwanda
Rwanda's new development strategy, as elaborated in
reports like Vision 2020 and the National Investment
Strategy, shows the country's determination to adopt S&T
as a fundamental tool to achieve economic development.
Key government measures to promote STI include
improvements to the country's S&T infrastructure through
public investment and South–South co-operation, the
promotion of a knowledge economy through information
technology and the application of science, as well as the
development of a small number of world-class institutions
of higher education, including the National University of
Rwanda and the Kigali Institute of Science, Technology and
Management.

At the African Union Summit in January 2007, Rwandan
President Paul Kagame announced that his country had
boosted expenditure on S&T from less than 0.5% of GDP 
a few years ago to 1.6%. He also said his country would
increase investment in R&D to 3% of GDP by 2012. That
would make Rwanda’s GERD/GDP ratio higher than that of
most developed countries. A country teetering on collapse
less than a decade ago and still living in the shadow of
genocide has embarked on a path that could lead to
science-based sustainable development.

In 2008, the government evoked the possibility of
establishing an endowment fund for innovation which
would also serve to build R&D capacity in Rwanda’s centres
of excellence. A first for Rwanda, the fund would be a
public–private partnership, with research teams being
entitled to apply for funding collectively, a move which
would facilitate the composition of multidisciplinary
research teams. At present, each researcher has to apply
for funding from individual ministries. However, at the time
of writing in early 2010, no specific amount had been
confirmed for the fund and the project was still under
consideration (Niyonshuti, 2010).

Senegal
In Senegal, agriculture earns around 14% of GDP and
employs three-quarters of the labour force (Figure 5). As in
many other African countries, it occupies the lion’s share
of research activities. In all, nine institutes conduct
agricultural research, the two core ones being the
Senegalese Institute for Agricultural Research (ISRA) and
the Institute of Food Technology (ITA), which employ 70%
and 5% of Senegalese researchers respectively.

Given the importance of agriculture, the government has
deployed a lot of energy in funding and re-organizing
agricultural research over the past decade. In 1999, it
created the National Fund for Agricultural and Agro-Food
Research (FNRAA) to serve as a mechanism for
channelling competitive funding during the first phase of
the World Bank’s PASAOP programme offering support to
farmers' organizations. This fund has since become an
instrument for harmonizing and promoting institutional
collaboration in agricultural R&D and related sectors.
FNRAA has been the major initiator of the National
Research System for Agriculture, Forestry and Animal
Husbandry (SNRASP) launched in June 2009. This system
has considerably strengthened co-operation among
major institutions operating in this sector. SNRASP derived
from a decree issued in November 2008, which itself
emanated from the Orientation Law adopted in June 2004
to implement a 20-year vision for the agriculture sector.
SNRASP aims to rationalize agricultural R&D and foster
inter-institutional collaboration, as well as the setting-up
of an efficient S&T information network for agriculture and
related sectors.

The Ministry of Scientific Research adopted a Strategic
Research Plan for 2006–2010 in June 2006. However, this
plan has not been implemented as expected, mostly due
to frequent cabinet reshuffles. The ministry merged with
the Ministry of Higher Education in October 2009 to form
the Ministry of Scientific Research and Higher Education.
In 2010, the ministry was putting together a formal STI
policy with UNESCO’s assistance. 

Founded in 1999, the National Academy of Science and
Technology of Senegal is an independent body that
provides evidence-based advice to the government and
alerts public opinion to S&T issues. The academy is divided
into four sections: agricultural sciences; health sciences;
science and technology; and economic and social
sciences.

Africa [16] [P3]:Layout 1  18/10/10  19:14  Page 313

The academy has clocked up a number of achievements.
For example, it has adopted a draft programme for the
development of science teaching in Senegal called the
National Indicative Programme. In parallel, it has reviewed
innovative experiences and trends at home and abroad as
a preamble to elaborating a science education policy.
Following a fact-finding mission to Saint-Louis, members
of the academy staged a special scientific session on the
theme of Floods and Management: the Case of Saint-Louis,
which resulted in the submission of a paper on a Flood
Control and Urban Management Strategy to the Ministry
of Hydraulics and Water Resources. The academy has also
organized a number of intercontinental conferences in
recent years, in partnership with the African Regional
Centre for Technology and within both the African Science
Academy Development Initiative (Box 5) and the
Knowledge Management Africa Initiative (Box 6). 

In May 2008, the National Agency for Applied Scientific
Research came into being. It operates directly under the
presidency with its own agenda. One of its main
programmes is the development of a science park
supported by the United Nations Department of Economic
and Social Affairs (UNDESA), which is supporting a similar
park in Ghana. The park in Senegal will focus on four areas:
ICTs; biotechnologies; the garment industry and;
aquaculture. The agency also organized a sub-regional
exhibtion on research and innovation in March 2010. 

South Africa
Just two years after the election of the country’s first
democratic government, a White Paper on Science and
Technology was published in 1996. Entitled Preparing for
the 21st Century, it pinpointed a number of systemic failures
(OECD, 1999):

I a fragmented and inadequately co-ordinated science

system;

I the erosion of innovative capacity;
I poor knowledge and technology flows from the science

base into industry;

I poor networking both within the region and in the

global context;

I low investment in R&D;
I imbalances created by past policies and actions;
I a lack of competitivity within the global environment.

The White Paper made a number of policy recommen-
dations for developing South Africa’s national innovation

Sub-Saharan Africa 

system, including: the re-allocation of government
spending according to new priorities to promote
innovative solutions for the disadvantaged, in particular;
the introduction of processes to challenge government
research institutions to derive more support from
competitive sources of funding; the promotion of the
diffusion of the results of R&D to make R&D expenditure
more efficient; and the introduction of longer-term
perspectives in planning and budgeting for R&D (OECD,
1999).

Six common themes emerged from the White Paper’s
review of policy documents (OECD, 1999):

I Promoting competitiveness and job creation;
I Enhancing the quality of life;
I Developing human resources;
I Working towards environmental sustainability;
I Promoting an information society;
I Producing a greater volume of knowledge-embedded

products and services.

In 2002, the government adopted the National Research
and Development Strategy. This document has since
formed the basis for the development of South Africa’s
national innovation system. To promote South Africa’s
competitiveness, the strategy identified key technology
missions and science platforms. The former include bio-
technology, nanotechnology and ICTs, and the latter
Antarctic research, marine biology, astronomy and
palaeosciences. 

The National Research and Development Strategy
recognized the need to develop synergies among the
public and private components of the science system to
create wealth, improve the quality of life, develop human
resources and build R&D capacity. It also fixed the
objective of attaining a GERD/GDP ratio of 1%. One of the
measures implemented by the government to realize this
goal is the R&D Tax incentive Programme launched in 2008
(see page 315).

Another objective of the National Research and
Development Strategy was to scale up the number of
skilled researchers and technologists by adopting a dual
upstream (existing R&D personnel) and downstream
(school learners) approach. Upstream, the government
has since put in place a South African Research Chairs
Initiative, a Centres of Excellence Programme and a

Postdoctoral Fellowship Programme. Downstream, it has
introduced Bursary Initiatives, Youth into Science and the
Science and Engineering and Technology Awareness
programmes.

Since the National Research and Development Strategy
was adopted, statistics gathering and analysis have been
reinforced and new indicators have been introduced to
assess how well the national innovation system is
performing. The role of the National Advisory Council on
Innovation (NACI) is to provide a diagnosis and propose
ways of improving the national innovation system.

NACI is comprised of 22 members. Established by law in
1997, the council advises the Minister of Science and
Technology and, through the minister, the Cabinet, on the
role and contribution of science, mathematics, innovation
and technology in promoting national objectives. NACI
also identifies R&D priorities. The council groups the full
spectrum of sectors and organizations involved in 
the South African national innovation system and is
supported by a professional secretariat based within the
Department of Science and Technology in Pretoria, as 
well as by three specialized advisory committees: 
Science, Engineering and Technology for Women; the
National Biotechnology Advisory Committee and; the
Indicators Reference Group.

Trends in R&D investment in South Africa
South Africa has managed to increase GERD from 0.7% at the
time the National Research and Development Strategy was
adopted to 0.9% in 2006. The business sector funded 44.8%
of GERD in 2006 and performed 57.7%. Investment is not
evenly spread around the country, however, as just three out
of nine provinces concentrate four-fifths of the total. A
National Survey of Research and Experimental Development
undertaken in 2006 and 2007 by the Department of Science
and Technology (DST, 2009) revealed that more than half
(51%) of the country’s R&D expenditure in the private and
public sectors was concentrated in the Gauteng Province.
The Western Cape (20.4%) and KwaZulu-Natal (11.0%)
Provinces ranked second and third respectively.

South Africa’s R&D effort can be broken down into 
15 broad fields. In 2006, the lion’s share of government
funding went to the engineering sciences (Figure 6). There
may be a correlation between this high level of funding and
the numerous breakthroughs in engineering by South Africa
in recent years, one example being the Southern African

Towards a knowledge economy in South Africa
In July 2007, the DST adopted a ten-year innovation plan
(2008–2018). Innovation towards a Knowledge-based Economy
builds on the foundations laid by the National Research and
Development Strategy adopted in 2002. The purpose of the
ten-year plan is to help drive South Africa’s transformation
towards a knowledge economy, one in which the production
and dissemination of knowledge lead to economic benefits
and enrich all fields of human endeavour. The plan is
underpinned by five grand challenges: 

I The ‘Farmer to Pharma’ value chain to strengthen the bio-

economy: over the next decade, the goal is for South
Africa to become a world leader in biotechnology and
pharmaceuticals, based on the nation’s indigenous
resources and expanding knowledge base (Box 8);

Box 10: The largest telescope in the Southern Hemisphere

The Southern African Large Telescope
(SALT) is the largest single optical
telescope in the Southern
Hemisphere (see photo, page 278)
with a hexagonal mirror array 11 m
across. It is located in the semi-
desertic region of Karoo in South
Africa. 

SALT is a facility of the South
African Astronomical Observatory
established in 1972 and run by 
South Africa's National Research
Foundation. Inaugurated in
November 2005, SALT has been
funded by a consortium of partners
from South Africa, the USA, 
Germany, Poland, India, the UK
and New Zealand.

The telescope will be able to
record distant stars, galaxies and
quasars a billion times too faint to be
seen with the naked eye, as faint as a
candle flame at the distance of the
Moon.

In 2010, the South African

Astronomical Observatory won 
a bid to host the International
Astronomical Union’s Office for
Astronomy Development, which will
play a key role in taking astronomy 
to the developing world by 
co-ordinating and managing all
educational activities. 

South African astronomy

celebrated another milestone in 2010
when the first four telescopes of the

KAT-7 demonstrator radio telescope
were linked together as an integrated
system to produce Africa's first
interferometric image of an
astronomical object. Interferometry
refers to a technique by which radio
signals collected at the same time by
a system of networked radio
telescopes are processed into a single
high-resolution image. This milestone
augurs well for the African bid to host
what will be the world's largest radio
telescope, the Square Kilometre Array,
because it demonstrates that Africans
have the technical expertise to build
such a complex working instrument.

I Space science and technology: South Africa should become
a key contributor to global space science and technology,
with the founding of the National Space Agency in 2009,
a growing satellite industry and a range of innovations in
space sciences, Earth observation, communications,
navigation and engineering;

I Energy security: South Africa must meet its medium-term
requirements in terms of energy supply while innovating
for the long term in clean-coal technologies, nuclear
energy, renewable energy and the promise of the
hydrogen economy;

I Global climate change science: South Africa’s geographical
position enables it to play a leading role in climate change
science;

I Human and social dynamics: as a leading voice among

developing countries, South Africa should contribute to a
greater global understanding of shifting social dynamics
and the role of science in stimulating growth and
development.

The government launched an R&D Tax incentive
Programme in 2008 to help reach the target stated in the
National Research and Development Strategy of a 1%
GERD/GDP ratio. The aim of the programme is to

encourage businesses to invest in R&D and innovation
(NACI, 2009). It encourages private companies to acquire
capital assets, labour and technology for R&D in the
manner they consider most productive then to claim the
tax incentive. The incentive includes a tax deduction of
150% in respect of actual expenditure incurred for eligible
activities and provides for an accelerated depreciation of
assets used for R&D over three years at the rate of
50:30:20.

The government has also introduced a scheme allowing it
to assess the impact of the R&D Tax Incentive Programme
on the economy and society. The Income Tax Act requires
the DST to report on the aggregate expenditure on R&D
activities and direct benefits of such activities in terms of
economic growth, employment and other government
objectives. 

In 1999, the DST set up an Innovation Fund. It invests in
late-stage R&D, intellectual property protection and the
commercialization of novel technologies. Among the
selection criteria, applicants are expected to form a
consortium and to propose a programme for diffusing
their new technology to small, medium-sized and micro-
enterprises. From 2010 onwards, applications for funding
will be administered by the newly created Technology
Innovation Agency.

UNESCO SCIENCE REPORT 2010

Among other measures to foster university–industry
linkages, science councils themselves are now entitled to
engage in high-tech spin-offs, either via their own R&D or
via the commercialization of research results acquired from
universities. The Department of Trade has also introduced
the Technology for Human Resources in Industry
Programme. Administered by the National Research
Foundation, it matches the funding provided by university–
industry research projects (OECD, 1999).

In 2008, South Africa exported most of its high technology to
Germany, followed by France, Nigeria and Zambia. Most of its
high-tech imports came from China, followed by the USA,
Germany and Sweden (NACI, 2009). 

Internet remains unaffordable for many South Africans, a
factor which hampers the development of a knowledge
economy. Just 8.2% of the population had access to Internet
in 2007. In a speech before Parliament in April 2010, the
Minister of Communications stated that ‘for the past five
years, the cost of communicating and doing business in
South Africa has been impeded by exorbitant charges.’ He
said that ‘consultation towards developing a comprehensive
ICT policy framework has begun’. He also announced that the
Department of Communications had developed an ICT Small
and Medium Enterprise Strategy for the establishment of ICT
business incubation centres in the Limpopo, Mpumalanga
and KwaZulu provinces (Minister of Communications, 2010).

South Africa is active in pan-African collaboration. It chairs
the Southern African Development Community (SADC) S&T
group, which recently drafted a 10-year plan for the SADC.
South Africa also supports three NEPAD flagship projects: the
African Institute for Mathematical Sciences, the African Laser
Centre and the Southern African Network for Biosciences.
South Africa also participates in the NEPAD/Southern African
Regional Universities Association roundtable discussions on
implementation of the CPA and on engineering capacity-
building for manufacturing. It has also offered to host the
African Observatory of Science, Technology and Innovation
(see page 299).

Uganda
Manufacturing, construction and mining are Uganda’s main
industries. The industrial sector accounts for about 25% of
GDP and is estimated to have grown by 7.0% in 2007, up
from 6.4% a year earlier. The discovery of commercially
viable oil deposits has prompted hopes that Uganda will
soon become a net oil exporter. 

316

It has been argued that it is not the level of innovation of a
country that is paramount but rather its ability to adopt,
adapt and absorb technologies. However, many industries in
Uganda are operating below capacity because 1) they have
imported obsolete technology or for lack of regular
maintenance of machinery, 2) some technologies are
unsuited to local conditions or even 3) because some
technologies have been imported without the technical
know-how to use them, rendering them useless – especially
when they break down. A further bottleneck stems from the
fact that a number of bodies mandated to oversee
technology transfer, assessment and forecasting have not
been given the means to carry out their mission. These
include the Uganda Investment Authority, the Uganda
Registration Services Bureau, the Uganda Industrial
Research Institute and the Uganda National Council for
Science and Technology.

The National Industrialization Policy of 2008 aims to create a
business-friendly environment for private sector-led,
environmentally sustainable industrialization to help
industries improve their productivity and the quality of their
products through innovation. It contains provisions for
developing domestic resource-based industries such as the
petroleum, cement, fertilizer and agro-processing industries
(leather goods, dairy products, garments, etc.), as well as
such knowledge-based industries as ICTs, call centres and
pharmaceuticals. Strategies include encouraging foreign
direct investment in industry and industry-related services,
the creation of a framework to support public–private
partnerships for the production of higher value-added
goods and services for domestic consumption and export, 
a wider tax base and greater integration with agriculture to
produce value-added niche products.

In 2008 the Atomic Energy Act established the Atomic
Energy Council. The act also provided a framework for the
promotion and development of nuclear energy for use in
power generation and other peaceful purposes.

Uganda’s Information and Communication Technology
Policy dates back to 2003. Although Internet access has
since grown to 2.5% (2006), Internet infrastructure
remains largely confined to the cities, with rural locations
depending primarily on VSAT applications. Phase One of
the National Backbone Infrastructure (NBI) initiative
ended in 2008 after covering Kampala with 900 km of
high-capacity fibre optic cables. Phase Two covered an
additional 1 500 km in 2009. As a result, the core

Africa [16] [P3]:Layout 1  18/10/10  19:14  Page 317

Sub-Saharan Africa 

telecommunications infrastructure network in and around
Kampala is relatively well developed, with some fibre
optic infrastructure and microwave links. New ICT
enterprises and training facilities have proliferated in the
form of handset sellers and airtime vendors that include
Midcom and Simba Telecom. ICT-related courses like
telecommunications engineering are also now being
offered at universities that include the Makerere
University IT Centre and the ICT incubation park of the
Uganda Investment Authority. 

Although GERD remains low in Uganda at around 0.3–0.4%
of GDP, all of government expenditure on R&D is used for
civil purposes, unlike many other countries where it also
encompasses defence spending (UNCST, 2007; 2009). 

In Uganda, there is little that would qualify as R&D according
to the strict definition in the Frascati Manual but the
government is investing in a wide range of R&D-based
programmes. These include programmes to support R&D
performed in the higher education sector, with funding from
the Millennium Science Initiative and the Swedish
International Development Agency. The government also
funds R&D programmes executed by government
departments and agencies which include the Uganda
Industrial Research Institute, the National Agricultural
Research Organisation and the Joint Clinical Research Centre.

The government is also funding projects administered by
the National Council for Science and Technology and
Makerere University to help businesses develop R&D. The
2010–2011 budget announced in June 2010 brings a 
breath of fresh air to the university. It foresees an extra 
US$ 2.2 million for Makerere University and US$ 1.8 million
to nurture a venture capital fund for start-up companies
launched by university graduates. Ugandan scientists are
also to receive a 30% rise in salary, the Uganda Industrial
Research Institute an extra US$ 540 000 and Enterprise
Uganda, a fund supporting entrepreneurship, a further 
US$ 450 000 (Nordling, 2010c). 

In 2006, Uganda received a US$ 25 million loan from the
World Bank to support S&T within the country, including
the creation of centres of scientific excellence that will
serve not only Uganda but the entire region. The grant
was given, in part, because of Uganda’s efforts to build its
own S&T capacities, particularly in the fields of agricultural
science and public health, including via the Uganda
National Health Research Organization Act (2006).

The National Agricultural Research Policy was released 
in 2003 in line with the principles of the Plan for
Modernization of Agriculture, in order to guide the
generation and dissemination of research and improved
technologies for agricultural development and promote
the uptake thereof. The policy includes guidelines for the
formulation and prioritization of agricultural research
programmes. Priority areas for R&D are:

I technology development and multiplication, including

the importation, adaptation and adoption of high-
yielding disease- and pest-resistant planting and
storing materials;

I socio-economic research, including participatory

needs assessment, technology adoption and impact
studies, policy research and analysis, cost-benefit 
studies and gender-responsive technologies;

I research on agriculture-related aspects of poverty and

food security;

I application of information technologies in developing

decision support systems, such as crop modelling;

I farm power and post-harvest technologies, including

animal traction, solar and wind energy and biogas;

I storage and preservation of perishable commodities

and agro-processing;

I land and water resources management, including soil

fertility, land degradation, production systems (for
crop, livestock, aquaculture, agro-forestry), water
harvesting techniques and irrigation;

I sustainable natural resource utilization, including

capture fisheries, biodiversity conservation and
environmental-friendly technologies.

I integration of indigenous knowledge into modern and

improved technologies, including disease and pest
control, food preservation and the improvement of
food palatability.

In 2008, Uganda’s cabinet approved the country’s first
National Biotechnology and Biosafety Policy. The policy
provides objectives and guidelines for the promotion and
regulation of biotechnology use in the country (Box 8).

UNESCO SCIENCE REPORT 2010

The National Council for Science and Technology submitted
a comprehensive national STI policy to the Cabinet for
approval and implementation in July 2006. The broad
objectives of this policy are to:

I increase public awareness and appreciation of STI;
I increase investment in STI;
I support R&D;
I strengthen the national system for technology transfer

and intellectual property management;

I improve the information management system;
I build and maintain STI human capital and infrastructure;
I strengthen systems for ensuring safety, ethics and high

standards in STI;

I strengthen the framework for STI co-ordination.

The national STI policy came a year after the government
introduced measures to improve scientific literacy and attract
more young people to scientific careers. Under the Science
Education Policy adopted in 2005, classes in biology,
chemistry and physics have become compulsory for all
secondary school pupils. First-year university students are also
obliged to take some science courses towards their degree.
The policy allocates nearly three-quarters of government
scholarships to students studying towards a science degree at
university and other institutions of tertiary education. 

CONCLUSION

While it appears that the majority of African leaders are
convinced that only through science-driven development
can their nations overcome poverty and achieve the
Millennium Development Goals, there is an urgent need for
single-minded political leadership to translate this conviction
into an articulated plan of action and for a strong
government commitment to implement it. There are seven
levels of action that require the attention of governments:

Firstly, it is essential that a national science policy based on
the technological and industrial needs of society be
appropriately designed in collaboration with the local
scientific leadership. For a country to have a clear and
effective science policy, it is imperative that an efficient
science policy organ be formed involving knowledgeable
and capable science managers and advisors with sufficient
responsibility and power to enable it to design and execute
the national science plan and co-ordinate all the country’s
S&T activities. The number of African countries with science

318

policy organs has, fortunately, substantially increased in
recent years, particularly at the ministerial level. There are
currently over 40 ministries responsible for national S&T
policies in the region. Nevertheless, a number of critical
problems have to be resolved before these bodies can
render the services expected of them. These problems are
largely caused by a shortage of funds and inefficiency in the
management and organization of S&T.

Secondly, it is essential that the science policy be fully
integrated into the nation’s development plan. This will
ensure that the S&T knowledge generated by various
research institutions is linked to the country’s socio-
economic and industrial needs. Furthermore, ensuring a
close relationship between the national development plan
and the national S&T policy will expand industrial
involvement and that of the productive sectors in R&D, on
the one hand, and promote mission-oriented R&D in support
of economic sectors, on the other. This is well-illustrated by
the case of the Republic of Korea where concerted action by
the government and private sector has helped the country
to achieve remarkable progress in S&T and industrial
development (see page 415).

Thirdly, the government must ensure that adequate, stable
funding is provided for the implementation of the national
S&T policy. As indicated earlier, without a firm commitment
by the majority of African governments to raising the level of
R&D funding from its current level of less than 0.3% of GDP to
at least 1%, no science policy will be effective in generating
and sustaining endogenous research. The average proportion
of GDP allocated to R&D in Africa is about one-tenth the
proportion in industrialized countries. This is in stark contrast
to the large percentage of GDP spent on the military.

Fourthly, to counteract brain drain and ensure a critical mass
of highly qualified experts in S&T, a number of world-class
research and training institutions in critical areas such as food
security, energy supply, tropical diseases, soil erosion, water
quality, deforestation and desertification must be established
and sustained on the continent. In addition, African states
and donor organizations need to act collectively to establish
high-level research and training centres in key areas of
frontier science and technology, such as molecular biology,
biotechnology, informatics, nanotechnology and new
materials. The African Academy of Science, which groups
eminent scientists from all over Africa and has facilitated the
establishment of a Network of Academies of Science on the
continent, can play a key role in developing regional

Africa [16] [P3]:Layout 1  18/10/10  19:14  Page 319

Sub-Saharan Africa 

programmes in S&T. Both the Academy of Science and the
network deserve strong support from African governments.

REFERENCES

Fifthly, every African country should strive to produce at least
1 000 scientists per million population by 2025. To facilitate
this trend, African governments and donor organizations
should fund a major scholarship programme to enable
African students to pursue postgraduate education at high-
level scientific institutions on the continent and in other
scientifically advanced developing countries. Such a
programme could be implemented in collaboration with the
Academy of Sciences for the Developing World. Special
attention should be paid to the discovery and development
of talent. Special programmes, such as the Olympiads aimed
at identifying students with exceptional scientific abilities,
should be supported at the national, sub-regional and
regional levels. Gifted students selected through these
programmes should be nurtured in an environment
conducive to accelerating the development of their talent.
This can be achieved through the establishment of national
or regional elite schools and colleges for gifted students, as
has been done in Central Asia (see page 240), or through the
design of intensive, challenging additional school and
university courses in basic sciences and mathematics.

Sixthly, there is an urgent need to restructure the systems of
secondary and higher education to make science more
interesting and attractive to the young. This means devising
a more hands-on approach to scientific study in the
classroom, emphasizing learning by doing rather than the
rote memorization that has historically characterised
scientific learning, especially in biology. La main à la pâte
initiative launched by the French Academy of Sciences a few
years ago has become a much emulated strategy for
educational reform in science.

Last but not least, African countries must support
programmes to increase scientific literacy among both
children and adults. As science gains prominence among
African countries, it is important to create and support
institutions for lifelong learning that enable people to
understand what science-based development means for
them and the role that science can play in poverty alleviation
and sustainable growth. Of the 2 400 science centres and
science museums worldwide, just 23 are in Africa, where they
are concentrated in five countries: Egypt, Tunisia, Botswana,
Mauritius and, most notably, South Africa, which hosts 
17 such centres. There is an urgent need to establish at least

INTRODUCTION

South Asia’s average economic growth of 6–7% in the 
past decade compares poorly with the economic growth of
the countries of East Asia during the same time period. 
A small country like Singapore, with a population of
5 million, earns ten times the export income 
(US$ 391 billion) of Pakistan and Bangladesh 
(US$ 33 billion) with their combined population of
326 million in 2008. South Asian countries continue to
suffer from low human development, gender
discrimination and social inequalities. Historical,
geographical and demographic factors have partly
contributed to this disparity but the fact remains that the
massive income and productivity gap between South Asian
countries and Singapore, the Republic of Korea or other
developed economies can primarily be attributed to the
lack of technological progress in these countries. 

The South Asian countries discussed in the present
chapter1 are also characterized by political instability,
regional conﬂicts, civil war and terrorism, not to mention
natural disasters. In Pakistan, the continuing conﬂict in the
northern regions of Swat and Waziristan has resulted in
the destruction of infrastructure and a large number of
displaced people. The army action to combat terrorism
continues at the time of writing this report in 2010. The
country also suﬀered ﬂooding in 2010 which left about 
25 million homeless and an earthquake in 2005 which
killed over 70 000. India, the Maldives and Sri Lanka were
all hit by a tsunami in 2004. Nepal’s protracted civil war
ended in 2008 with the country oﬃcially abandoning the
monarchy and the Maoists giving up armed resistance
before going on to win the elections. Afghanistan is still at
war but Sri Lanka’s three decades of civil war ended in
2009 with hope for future economic growth.

The current global economic recession has inevitably
slowed growth rates and foreign capital inflows, resulting in
an increase in the number of people living below the
poverty line in South Asia.2 The economic slowdown is
more visible in Pakistan than elsewhere in the region owing
to the increasing incidence of terrorism, political instability,
energy shortages and an ongoing army operation that
consumes more than half of Pakistan’s annual development

1. Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and 
Sri Lanka. Iran is discussed in Chapter 16 and India in Chapter 17.
2. Defined as living on less than US$ 2 a day

budget. Pakistan’s GDP growth of 6.8% in 2007 declined to
2.7% in 2009. The economies of Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and
Nepal, which had also shown signs of fatigue in 2008, have
bounced back in the last quarter of 2009, showing relative
resilience. As for Bhutan, its economy was not affected due
to its weak integration in the global economy.     

Among competing priorities, the governments of these
countries are compelled to divert a large amount of
resources towards addressing rehabilitation, meeting
increased military expenditure, immediate infrastructure
needs and security issues. Furthermore, debt repayments
also subtract a substantial amount from national incomes.
Within this resource-constrained environment, the region
faces enormous challenges in achieving progress towards
the Millennium Development Goals (Annex II) and
simultaneously addressing the opportunities and risks of
globalization, technological change and economic growth.
According to Mahroum (2008), the current global recession
can be turned into an opportunity if there is greater
scientific collaboration both within the region and on a
global scale. 

The scarcity of investment capital in South Asian countries
should not be an excuse, however, for budget cuts in
human development and scientific research. It is a
demonstrated fact that S&T capabilities are essential for
meeting the challenges of development. S&T can provide
solutions for eliminating poverty, hunger and disease, 
for combating natural disasters and preserving the
environment. The wide technology and innovation
capability gap of the South Asian countries will widen
further if timely action is not taken to:

I increase investment in human development; 
I develop infrastructure for scientific research and

information technology (IT); 

I introduce incentives to build the absorptive capacity of

firms through contract research; 

I promote entrepreneurship.  

The integration of public institutions and private
enterprises locally and within global knowledge networks
can help reduce the knowledge and innovation gap in
these countries. Policies and strategies need to be designed
collectively to address common regional problems such as
lagging social development, environmental degradation
and infectious diseases, as well as to improve economic
competitiveness in general.

STRUCTURE OF SOUTH ASIAN
ECONOMIES

The structure of South Asian economies and their relative
share of GDP are shown in Figure 1. The share of agriculture
ranges from a high of 35% in Nepal to a low of 6% in the
Maldives. Despite a continual decline in the share of

agriculture in GDP, almost 70% of people in the region
remain dependent on agriculture for their livelihoods.
Furthermore, many of them work in the informal services
sector, which demands little knowledge input. The
knowledge-intensive sectors are relatively small, as
innovation in both the formal and informal sectors remains
concentrated within a small segment of the economy.

South Asia

South Asia contributes less than 2% of world exports,
in comparison to 12% by East Asian countries. The
composition of exports shows a small share of high-tech
products of less than 6%, compared to an average of 34%
for East Asia. The recent growth in exports has been
mostly confined to manufactured primary goods, with the
exception of India whose exports are increasingly driven
by skill-intensive manufacturing and services (Table 1).
Due to lack of co-operation within the region, South Asia
has been unable to leverage its regional trade potential of
an additional US$ 20 billion per annum.

R&D INPUT
Trends in R&D expenditure 
While global expenditure on research and development
(R&D) has been rising consistently, two of the ten countries
which contribute 78% of the total are now emerging
economies: China (9.2%) and India (2.2%).3 South Asia’s
contribution to global R&D expenditure is estimated at a
pitiful 4% of the total and even this expenditure mostly
comes from public development budgets and is utilized
primarily to fund public universities and research bodies. 

The Global Competitiveness Report of the World Economic
Forum has benchmarked the following stages in the
economic development of a country: i), Factor-driven, 
ii) Transition, iii) Efficiency-driven, iv) Transition, and 
v) Innovation-driven. This classification is based on 
12 pillars for which a number of indicators have been
developed. These 12 pillars are: institutions; infrastructure;
macro-economic stability; health and primary education;
higher education and training; goods market efficiency;
labour market efficiency; financial market sophistication,
technological readiness, market size, business
sophistication and innovation. Within this framework, the
economies of all countries in South Asia, including India,
are classified as Factor-driven (WEF, 2009). (See Figure 1 on
page 185 for a comparison with Southeast Europe.)

Within the South Asian region, Pakistan experienced the
fastest growth in gross domestic expenditure on R&D
(GERD) and funding allocation for IT and higher education
during 2002–2008. President Musharraf’s commitment
resulted in unprecedented growth in the budgets of
higher education and science and technology (S&T).
Public R&D expenditure, which had fluctuated for several
years between 0.2% and 0.4% of GDP, was boosted to
nearly 0.7% of GDP in 2007, according to the UNESCO
Institute for Statistics (Figure 2). Most of the R&D budget
was spent on modernizing the dilapidated R&D

3. The others are the USA (32.4%), Japan (13.0%), Germany (6.1%), France
(3.8%), Republic of Korea (3.7%), UK (3.3%), Canada (2.1%) and Russia

UNESCO SCIENCE REPORT 2010

Box 1: Social research and the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission

The Pakistan Atomic Energy
Commission (PAEC) in Islamabad
manages several research
laboratories in different parts of
Pakistan. Almost 50% of the budget
allocated to PAEC is spent on social
research in the fields of nuclear
energy, renewable energy, health,
agriculture and environment. In the
health sector, PAEC has established 
14 centres in various parts of the
country where patients requiring
radiation-related treatment receive
medical care. PAEC also has four

agriculture and biotechnology
centres which have discovered
several new varieties of wheat 
and cotton. 

The efforts of the PAEC Chair, 
Dr Ishfaq Ahmad (1991–2001), led 
to the establishment of the Global
Change Impact Studies Centre in
2002. The centre conducts research
on the impact of global climate
change on Pakistan in such areas as
water resources and agriculture,
environment, biodiversity, health and
energy. It is also responsible for

identifying appropriate adaptation
measures. In January 2005, it was
designated the secretariat for the
newly established Prime Minister's
Committee on Climate Change
grouping relevant ministers. The
centre has established collaboration
with several research organizations
both in Pakistan and in Bangladesh,
India, Nepal and Sri Lanka, as well as
beyond the immediate region.

infrastructure in universities and promoting information
and communication technologies (ICTs), biotechnology
and engineering research. Defence R&D consumes 60% of
public expenditure on R&D in Pakistan. Unlike the USA
where the findings of defence R&D is widely diffused for
the benefit of economic and social institutions, most of
this research remains classified in South Asian countries.
An exception is the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission,
which has made remarkable contributions to agriculture
and health research (Box 1). 

The private sector use of public R&D expenditure is low in
South Asia in general and particularly low in the countries
under discussion: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, the
Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. This is due to the
fact that these countries have followed a linear S&T policy
model. The linear model encouraged research in public
institutions, on the assumption that local industry would
use this knowledge. There have been no incentives for
university–industry collaboration or for the promotion of
contract research by industry, even though the promotion
of R&D in private enterprises is vital for innovation and
consequently for economic development. 

South Asian countries should foster public policies that
support a continuous learning process in firms. At the
initial stages of the development of the Republic of Korea
and Japan, private companies were encouraged by
government subsidies in the form of tax incentives and
subsidized bank loans to import capital technology for

manufacturing. Firms were encouraged to reverse-
engineer imported technology and to promote learning-
by-doing practices. In the second phase, firms were
motivated to develop their own design capabilities and a
learning culture to enable them to absorb and adapt
imported technology. As firms advanced in their learning
curves, they realized the importance of in-house R&D and
continual upgrading of the skills of their technical,
management and marketing personnel if they were to
survive in increasingly competitive global markets. The
rise in private R&D expenditure in these countries has
accompanied a shift in the composition of exports, from
low value-added agriculture-based products to value-
added manufacturing in agriculture, automobiles,
electrical and electronic goods.   

The growing role of transnational companies in R&D
According to UNCTAD’s Global Investment Report (2005),
transnational companies are major contributors to global
GERD. Over 80% of the 700 biggest-spending firms on
R&D come from just five countries: the USA, Japan,
Germany, UK and France. Since R&D is a capital-intensive
activity, the number of transnational companies
expanding their R&D activities in developing countries is
growing. These large firms are seeking low-cost, highly
skilled R&D personnel, on the one hand, and access to
centres of excellence in developing countries, on the
other. The potential benefits for the host country depend
on the quality of its infrastructure and the availability of
highly skilled R&D personnel.

(see page 363). These companies rank among the world’s top 1
250 companies in terms of R&D investment. 
In Pakistan and Iran, the pharmaceutical and automobile
sectors are showing significant growth but no reliable statistics
are available on private R&D expenditure in these countries.

Trends in human resources
General trends in education
South Asia has the world’s highest number of adult 
(392.7 million) and young (67.1 million) illiterates, 63% of
whom are female. The majority of the illiterate population
lives in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India and Pakistan. Only
half of the region’s secondary school age group of 
242 million is currently enrolled in school. Secondary
enrollment ratios in the region range from 87% for Sri Lanka
to just 29% for Afghanistan, with female secondary
enrollment across the region being significantly lower than
for males in some countries (Table 2).

Only Iran, the Maldives and Sri Lanka have achieved
significant improvements in literacy in recent years. 
Sri Lanka and the Maldives can now boast of universal
primary literacy. Iran has also made big strides in 
improving adult literacy rates and narrowing the 
gender gap (see page 350). 

At 3.4% of GDP on average, South Asia’s expenditure on
education remains lower than that of East Asian and
Caribbean countries, which devote 4–9% of their much larger
GDP to education. Table 3 shows a modest increase in

Private R&D expenditure in India represents 20% of total
expenditure, according to the UNESCO Institute for Statistics,
and is rising, due to the fact that a large number of
multinationals have recently moved their R&D activities to
India. Large firms in India working in the pharmaceutical, steel
and automobile sectors are investing in R&D. Among local
R&D investors, there are Ranbaxy and Dr Reddy’s Labs in
pharmaceuticals and Tata Motors in the automobile sector

expenditure on education since 1990 in all but India and a
corresponding decrease in military expenditure in all but Iran,
Nepal and Sri Lanka. Pakistan’s expenditure on education has
remained static for several years, partly due to relatively high
military expenditure attributed to regional tensions, a
prolonged Afghan war and expanding terrorism, and a higher
ratio of debt repayment to GDP than its neighbours.
Expenditure on higher education in Pakistan did, however,
witness unprecedented growth of almost 2 000% between
2002 and 2008. 

Researchers in South Asia
In the contemporary global knowledge economy, higher
education is viewed as a critical economic resource.
Universities are expected both to produce a flexible
labour force with multidisciplinary skills and a quest for 
lifelong learning and play an entrepreneurial role by
transferring and applying the knowledge generated to
support industrial processes and increase the
endogenous competitive advantage. In most South
Asian countries, the systems or institutions which
transfer knowledge to economic advantage are either
non-existent or underdeveloped. Consequently, existing
knowledge, be it tacit or codified, is seldom integrated in
the development system. Although the region trains a

large number of scientists and engineers – India has the
third-largest body of scientists in the world – all
countries face an extreme shortage of highly skilled
university teachers and researchers, managers and other
skilled personnel. Thomson Reuters’ Science Citation
Index (SCI) provides information on 5 000 highly cited
researchers in 22 scientific fields the world over. These
scientists are selected on the basis of maximum received
citations within a prescribed period. The database
includes just 13 researchers from South Asia. Among
these, 11 come from India and just one each from Iran
and Pakistan. 

The number of researchers per million population in the
region varies from 706 per million in Iran to just 46 per
million in Bangladesh (Table 4). As concerns the number
of researchers working in private enterprises, this
information is unfortunately not documented for South
Asian countries, despite being an important measure of
innovation activity.

In sum, South Asian countries are faced with the dual
challenge of widening access to higher education and
ensuring it is of quality and relevance to their economy. An
additional challenge will be to retain the talented scientists
and engineers they train in an expanding global labour
market for highly skilled personnel. A 2008 study by the UK
Parliamentary Office cited data from the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)
indicating that, of the 59 million migrants living in OECD
countries, 20 million were highly skilled. This migration is
not only depriving South Asian countries of much-needed
skills but is also a burden on their fragile economies. Since
higher education receives generous subsidies from the
state in most South Asian countries, brain drain means that
the benefits of these subsidies go to the developed host
countries. Data from the Pakistan Bureau of Emigration
show that 2.82 skilled and semi-skilled workers emigrated
between 1970 and 2000. This number soared to 4.50
million during 2000–2005. Of these, 88 572 were highly
skilled. Bangladesh and Sri Lanka are experiencing a similar
exodus. The Bangladesh Bureau of Migration, Employment
and Training reports that 6.57 million skilled and semi-
skilled workers left Bangladesh for employment abroad
between 1976 and 2008, 4% of whom were highly
qualified professionals. A 2006 survey by Sri Lanka’s
National Science Foundation found that the number of
economically active scientists in Sri Lanka had decreased
between 1996 and 2006 from 13 286 to 7 907. 

South Asia chapter [16] [P3]:Layout 1  18/10/10  19:31  Page 329

South Asia

In response to the growing demand for highly skilled
personnel and the threat of persistent brain drain, South
Asian countries have begun taking steps to reform their
higher education systems, as we shall see in the country
profiles beginning on page 386. In this regard, India and
China can serve as models. Although both have suffered
extensive brain drain in recent decades, they have
successfully used their diaspora as a ‘brain reserve’ abroad to
stimulate high-tech industries at home. Today, expatriates are
even beginning to return, drawn by a booming economy
and exciting professional opportunities.

R&D OUTPUT
Trends in scientific papers
South Asia contributes just 2.7% of research papers
published in international journals abstracted from the
database of Thomson Reuters’  Web of Knowledge. 
Eight-year publication data show a rising trend in research
publications from 2002 onwards for India, Iran and Pakistan
which can be attributed to the substantial rise in public 
R&D expenditure in these countries (Table 5).

While the number of research papers contributed by a
country is a quantitative indicator, the number of citations
received by these papers is considered as reflecting the
quality of research. In its bimonthly newsletter, Thomson
ScienceWatch.com produces a listing of scientists,
institutions and countries that have achieved the highest
percentage increase in total citations in a given period.
From December 2007 to February 2008, Iran and Pakistan
consistently appeared in the list of countries ranked as

Table 5: Scientific publications in South Asia, 2000–2008

‘rising stars’ for achieving maximum citations of papers
published in multiple fields.

According to Thomson Reuters’  Web of Science database,
almost 87% of research articles by Bangladeshi scientists
came from just seven institutions, listed in descending order
as: Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology,
University of Dhaka, International Centre for Diarrheal
Diseases, Rajshahi University of Engineering and Technology,
Bangladesh Agriculture University, Jahangirnagar
University and the Chittagong University of Engineering
and Technology. An a analysis of the research output of
these universities reveals priority areas to be predominantly
in the realms of agriculture and engineering.

Collaboration in scientific research
Scientific collaboration within and beyond national borders
is considered vital for enhancing scientific capabilities
through the pooling of the best scientific expertise and of
funding. It also reduces wastage from duplication in a
resource-constrained environment. Regional scientific
collaboration may result not only in lower project costs for
large projects of common interest but also in the sharing of
technical risks. International scientific collaboration is
growing and is considered a preferred method of building
scientific capacity in developing countries.  

One method of measuring collaboration is through
mapping of co-authored scientific papers published from
the institutions of South Asian countries. The Thomson
Reuters database provides information on the percentage
of co-authored research papers published by the scientists
of South Asian countries in international journals. India, Iran

Patent applications from South Asia
Patent applications filed by public research organizations
and local and foreign firms are an indication of the
dynamism of innovation. Foreign firms undertaking
innovation in a country protect their inventions through
patents to block competitors and imitators, so as to
exploit the right to market their innovation either locally
or for export. For both India and Pakistan, patent
applications from non-residents are much higher than
those filed by residents (Table 6). 

In Bangladesh, the recent growth in international
publications has not been matched by greater patenting
activity or by other efforts to commercialize research
produced in public laboratories. University–industry
collaboration appears to remain limited and there seems
to be no concerted effort to integrate knowledge
produced in public R&D organizations in the productive
sector. A study commissioned by the United Nations
Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) to
evaluate the impact of intellectual property rights (IPRs)
on innovation in Bangladesh in textiles, agro-processing
and generic drugs found that innovation capabilities
were very low in all three sectors (Sampath, 2007). The
study demonstrated that local firms did not consider
technology transfer from the public sector to the private
sector as being important for innovation. Rather,
process innovations at the firm level were limited to
imitation.

UNIVERSITY–INDUSTRY
COLLABORATION

Innovation is an interactive process requiring dynamic
networks between the users and producers of knowledge.
Several studies have mentioned the huge potential for
commercialization of the untapped scientific knowledge
that exists in the public laboratories of South Asian
countries, particularly those of India, Iran, Pakistan and Sri
Lanka. In almost all the countries of the region, incentives
for public sector laboratories to work with industry are
either ineffective or missing altogether. The service
structures of scientists and engineers need to become
changed to motivate them either to seek careers in
industry or be actively involved in solving problems of
industry. Increasing the mobility of scientists via
appropriate incentive measures is the best route for
knowledge transfer from university to industry.

Box 2: The story of CASE and CARE

The Centre for Advanced Studies in
Engineering (CASE) and its sister
organization, the Centre for Advanced
Research in Engineering (CARE), offer a
model in Pakistan for university–
industry partnerships.

CASE is a project of the Engineering

Education Trust. It was developed by a
devoted group of Pakistani and US
qualified engineers as a self-financing
school in Islamabad in 2001. The centre
primarily studies chip design, control
systems, computer networks, digital

signal processing, lasers and optics, as
well as various areas of engineering
management. CASE graduates find
employment in prestigious national
and international institutions. The
centre has 50 PhD students, the first of
whom graduated in 2008.

CARE has also provided services to
national defence bodies. The
organization recently (2007) won an
R&D grant of US$180 million from the
Pakistani army on a competitive basis
for a military project.

Science parks, industrial parks and technology incubators
act as intermediary institutions to foster technology 
spin-offs from public research laboratories. South Asian
countries are making efforts to establish these. There are
176 information technology parks operating in India. Iran
has established 12 technology parks and 40 technology
incubators. These have helped 3 500 students create 
500 new start-up companies (Mansouri, 2006). Pakistan
has 11 information technology parks and just two business
incubators: one at the National University of Science and
Technology and the other, privately operated, at the Fauji
Foundation in Rawalpindi (see also Box 2).

Technology-based start-ups also require venture capital
and funding by business angels. Public research institutes
themselves need help in business planning and product
marketing. In South Asia, however, both venture capital
and business angels are in short supply.

INFORMATION INFRASTRUCTURE

Information and communication technologies (ICTs) are
playing an increasingly important role in development. 
ICT’s provide the means for bridging the knowledge gap
between developed and developing countries. As
enabling technologies, ICTs help stimulate innovation
and increase economic productivity through 
e-governance, e-commerce and e-education. The
availability and quality of ICT infrastructure is the
determining factor in exploiting the full potential of

these technologies. Figure 4 shows the relative Internet
connectivity in South Asia. Iran has better Internet access
than other countries in the region. Pakistan was a late 
starter in building ICT infrastructure; however, an
investment-friendly ICT policy launched in 2001 has 
resulted in a rapid increase in Internet connectivity and
access to mobile phone coverage, with 80 million users 
in 2009. Bangladesh has extremely low Internet access 
but this may change with the adoption of an ambitious
Information and Communication Technology Policy in 
2009 (see page 337). 

Broadband connectivity is still limited to a small number
of people in South Asia. ICTs provide all countries with
opportunities not only to maximize their own R&D input
by connecting researchers within the country but also to
tap into the international pool of knowledge and research.
National research and education networks are now
considered an essential part of R&D infrastructure (Box 3). 

PROMOTING COLLABORATION FOR
TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT 

Technology purchases through licensing
The global purchasing of technology through the
payment of license fees (or royalties) is often used as a
comparative indicator for measuring the inward flow of
technology. In South Asia in 2007, the maximum amount
of licensing fees for the purchase of foreign technology
was paid by India (US$ 949 million), followed by Pakistan

(US$ 107 million). This is a pittance compared to the
amount paid by China and the Republic of Korea in the
same year. The licensing of foreign technology for the
purpose of production or services by local firms needs to
be combined with incentives for learning and innovation,
which should result in license fees or royalties earned
through technology exports. India and Pakistan both
earned small amounts in license fees from the sales of
their technologies in 2007, especially in comparison to the
Republic of Korea (Figure 5).

Foreign direct investment
Foreign direct investment (FDI) is not just a source of
capital and employment creation. Successful FDI policy
not only creates employment opportunities but also
results in technology transfer and knowledge spillovers.
FDI that benefits the local economy through forward and
backward linkages can contribute to the transfer of
knowledge and sustained economic growth. Vertical and
horizontal effects can help local firms raise productivity as
a result of improvements in human capital and industrial
management skills, efficiency in production processes,
technological capabilities and R&D. China, for example,
has attracted FDI in knowledge-intensive, export-oriented
manufacturing and has encouraged linkages between

Box 3: Two examples of e-networks for education and research

Pakistan Education and Research
Network
Implemented in 2002, the Pakistan
Education and Research Network
(PERN) is connected with 60 public
sector universities via a fibre-optic
broadband network. A digital library
service provides access to over 
23 000 research journals and 
45 000 graduate-level books for all
universities free of charge. 

PERN has integrated Pakistani

scientists and researchers and
encouraged national knowledge
networks on 155 Mbps connectivity.
PERN2 was launched in 2008 with
the increased bandwidth of 10 Gbps. 
It connects PERN with international

research networks operating in East
Asia, Europe and the USA.

Nepal Research and Education
Network
The Nepal Research and Education
Network (NREN) is a public–private
initiative established in 2007 to check
brain drain and develop research
infrastructure. It is using ICTs to create
a national network for advanced
research and education that will also
give researchers access to information
and data around the world. 

In 2008, NREN obtained a grant

from the Information Society
Innovation Fund in Asia for a project
to develop the high-speed backbone

for the Nepal Research and Education
Network. This network is developing
e-learning for higher education in
villages and remote areas in the local
language and creating an Intranet
portal and telemedicine for health
posts in villages.

NREN networks with its

counterparts elsewhere in South Asia
and beyond. Its activities are
supported by the Network Start-up
Resource Center at the University of
Oregon in the USA and by Keio
University in Japan, among others.

transnational companies and local universities. The
productivity of firms operating in China’s export zones is
reported to be three times higher than that of firms
operating on the mainland.

Within the Asian continent, South Asia remains an
unattractive destination for FDI. In 2008, India received
the highest amount (US$ 41.5 billion), partly due to the
size of its economy but above all because of the
relatively higher number of scientists and engineers
trained in India than elsewhere. This amount may 
sound substantial but it pales in comparison with the
US$ 187 billion China received in 2008. India’s ICT and
pharmaceutical sectors have attracted FDI in R&D
services. Hundreds of foreign firms have established R&D
units in India (see page 363). While it is too early to assess
the spillover effect of these transnational corporations
on R&D investment in India, the gains are already visible
in terms of additional employment and the size of the
diaspora returning home to seize employment
opportunities with multinationals.

Pakistan’s attractiveness for FDI improved between 2005
and 2006, with Pakistan climbing from 114th to 83rd place.
Since 2005, Pakistan has also had the highest Inward FDI

Afghanistan 
Higher education reforms 
Afghanistan has begun the process of re-opening and
reconstructing universities since the fall of the Taliban in
2001 but the overall capacities of these institutions are
limited and do not meet the overwhelming demand for
access from the increasing number of high-school
graduates.

Higher education is one of the eight pillars of the Afghan
National Development Strategy for 2008–2014. In
December 2009, the Ministry of Higher Education
launched the National Higher Education Strategic Plan for
2010–2014, after organizing a series of consultation
workshops with Afghan universities earlier the same year
with support from UNESCO and the World Bank. The Plan
builds on an earlier framework for the reform of higher
education developed by the Ministry of Higher Education
with the support of UNESCO’s International Institute for
Educational Planning in 2004. This already covered a wide
spectrum of reform, spanning the institutional structure
of universities, questions of governance, recruitment and
retention of staff and students, the relationship between
teaching and research, management, finance and the
procurement of equipment, land and textbooks.

The National Higher Education Strategic Plan for
2010–2014 outlines two broad programmes. 
Programme I seeks to educate and train skilled graduates
to meet the country’s socio-economic development
needs. It includes various sub-programmes for
developing infrastructure and for building human
capacity in the higher education sector, including
curriculum development and the participation of
graduate students in regional and international research
partnerships. The Plan affirms that research policy and
practice should focus on S&T as a cornerstone of
development. In 2010, UNESCO was supporting the
Ministry of Higher Education in developing an S&T policy. 

Programme II aspires to lead and manage a co-ordinated
system of higher education comprising universities,
institutes and community colleges. It focuses on
governance and developing capacity both in the Ministry of
Higher Education and universities. It also tackles the issues
of access to university and the expansion and structure of

334

the higher education system. It plans to redesign the
national admissions examination, a task that has been
entrusted to a committee set up for the purpose in early
2010. The national admissions system will be computerized
to make it efficient and user-friendly. It will also be
configured to ensure that applicants with optimum
potential are admitted to university, taking into account
national needs. Programme II will also establish a self-
assessment process for universities and found an agency
responsible for quality assurance and accreditation in
Afghanistan. 

The Plan will establish a national research and education
network linking all universities and institutes in
Afghanistan to the Ministry of Higher Education and the
Internet, in order to allow data-sharing and provide
access to a digital library. 

Another challenge for the ministry will be the
development and institutionalization of a Higher
Education Management Information System (HEMIS) to
ensure proper planning and monitoring of the National
Higher Education Strategic Plan over the next five years.

Specific targets of the Plan to 2014 include:
I increasing the number of faculty members with

master’s degrees by 60% and faculty members with
PhDs to at least 20%5;

I establishing five comprehensive research universities;
I reaching a target of at least 30% female university

students; 

I increasing the number of students enrolled in
universities from 62 000 at present to 110 000;

I establishing five community colleges with a total

enrollment of at least 5 000 students, giving a total of
115 000 students and 800 additional staff.

Another important aspect of the Plan is its funding
strategy for universities. The Ministry of Higher Education
will continue to decentralize financial control to
universities and other institutes, and to push for legislation 
allowing universities to raise and spend funds from non-
government sources. The ministry will also facilitate
fundraising from non-governmental sources for higher
education and work to establish scholarships for poor
students. 

5. In 2008, 5.5% of the 2 526 faculty members at Afghan universities held
PhDs, 30.1% a Master of Arts or MSc and 63.8% a Bachelor of Arts.

Bangladesh
Challenges for higher education
A higher level of investment in education in general and
higher education in particular has shown tangible results
in Bangladesh. The number of universities has expanded
from just seven in the 1980s to over 80 today, with total
enrollment in the tertiary sector of about 2 million
students. There are deepening concerns, however, about
the quality of graduate education.

The problem of poorly educated graduates from tertiary
institutions in Bangladesh is attributed to the structure of
tertiary education. Most tertiary enrollment in Bangladesh
takes place in degree colleges and public and private
universities. Degree colleges attract the lion’s share of
enrollment at the tertiary level. These colleges suffer,
however, from poor infrastructure and a dearth of trained
teachers. Public universities are themselves hampered by
an inadequate financial allocation that prevents them
from upgrading their research and information
infrastructure. This forces them to raise tuition fees to
narrow the funding gap. The limited number of places at
public universities and the high tuition fees charged by
private universities block access to the university system
in Bangladesh. Moreover, public and private universities
compete for the limited number of highly trained faculty.
This staffing shortage obliges private universities to draw
upon the faculty strength of public universities on a part-
time basis. University faculty are consequently unable to
devote sufficient time to teaching and research, resulting
in the transmission of an education of uncertain quality.

This state of affairs culminates in graduates who turn out to
be uncompetitive by market standards. It also leads to weak
linkages between public universities and employers in the
job market. Consequently, university graduates produced
at considerable cost to the nation remain unemployed for 
a long period of time. Even when they do find employment,
it is often in areas outside their field of study.

In 2003, the Ministry of Education proposed a 20-year plan
for higher education formulated with the help of six expert
groups. This reform is coupled with the promotion of ICTs, as
Internet coverage remains low in Bangladesh compared to
other countries in the region, at just 0.32% in 2008 (Figure 4). 

Industrial development in Bangladesh
Agriculture has long been the backbone of the economy
and the chief source of income for the majority of people in

South Asia

Bangladesh, even though it contributes just 19% to GDP
(Figure 1). The government plans to reduce poverty by
increasing agricultural productivity and achieving self-
reliance in food production. It also plans to increase income
from non-agricultural exports through industrialization. As
part of the implementation strategy for this industrialization
plan, industries have been rapidly established in the
following areas: textiles, light engineering, pharmaceuticals,
ship-building, leather goods, ICTs and agro-based and agro-
supportive sectors. In the chemical sector, a large number of
industries have been set up, including tanneries, dying,
printing and soap production (see also Box 4).

The government plans to develop 79 industrial estates in
different districts of Bangladesh. Sixty of these industrial
estates were in the initial stages of development in 2009 as
part of the first phase. Industries involving investment of up
to Taka 10 crores (approx. US$ 1.4 million) are being set up on
these estates. They concern mainly food and allied products,
chemicals, engineering and textiles. A number of the
industrial estates have been supported by private initiatives.

Two export processing zones were in the early stages of
development in 2009. The Export Processing Zone
Authority is creating four zones in the cities of Dhaka,
Chittagong and Khulna. Two additional export processing
zones are to be established via private initiatives. Both
medium-sized and large export-oriented industries are
being established via joint ventures with foreign firms. The
government also plans to establish industrial parks and
garment factories. The major exporting sectors of the
country are now textiles, garments, jute and jute products,
leather and leather products and tea. The contribution of
the industrial sector to GDP is about 29% (Figure 1).

In recent years, Bangladesh has managed not only to
increase its exports substantially but also to diversify them.
At the time Bangladesh achieved independence in 1971, jute
and tea were the major export-oriented industries. Exposed
to frequent flooding which reduced jute yields, as well as
falling jute fibre prices and a considerable decline in world
demand, the role of the jute sector in the country’s economy
has declined. Consequently, the focus has shifted towards
textile manufacturing and the garment industry in particular.

The garment industry has been a major source of foreign
exchange for the past 25 years. At present, the country
generates about US$ 5 billion from exports of garments
and apparel. The industry employs about 3 million workers,

Box 4: The City Cluster Economic Development Initiative

The Asian Development Bank’s City
Cluster Economic Development
initiative attempts to activate industrial
clusters by supporting their growth.
Research conducted for the initiative
measured and compared attributes of
competitiveness for more than 30
cities and towns across Bangladesh,
India and Sri Lanka. Researchers
identified, mapped and analysed
sectoral and spatial changes in urban
industry and economic activities. 

Three competitive industries that

have formed spatial clusters but are still

at a dormant stage were identified in
the capital of each country. Commonly,
these industrial clusters require support
in several critical areas: R&D, vocational
skills training, knowledge-sharing,
marketing (software infrastructure) and
basic urban infrastructure, such as a
water supply, waste management,
electricity, IT, roads, transportation and
logistics (hardware infrastructure).

After helping to identify clusters
that are either at a dormant stage or
involve environmental improvements
and waste management, such as the

tannery industry in Dhaka, the
initiative plans to help jump-start
these industrial clusters by providing
support in the areas identified above,
with private-sector participation. The
project will also allow policy-makers
to make informed decisions on
‘where to invest first’ and ‘what to
invest in,’ so as to maximize economic
impact with limited resources.

90% of whom are women. Bangladesh has benefited from
the trend of relocating production to developing
countries. Two vital non-market elements have contributed
to the garment industry’s success: (a) quotas under the
Multi-Fiber Arrangement in the North American market
and (b) special access to European markets. 

In 2008, the shipbuilding industry emerged as a sector
with great potential for development. The industry aimed
to fetch over US$ 1 billion through exports of ocean-going
ships in 2009. The industry had export orders worth over
US$ 800 million in 2008 for about 50 ocean-going vessels.
The Ananda Shipyard, a local ship-building company, has
received orders from various European and African
countries for the construction of 40 ships and ferries
worth a total of US$ 450 million. A second local ship-
building company, the Western Marine Shipyard Ltd, 
is exporting 12 ships each weighing 5 200 tonnes to
Denmark, Germany and the Netherlands by 2010.

The pharmaceutical sector has emerged as one of
Bangladesh’s most developed high-tech sectors, with
potential for further growth. The sector not only meets
97% of domestic demand but also exports medicines 
to markets worldwide, including Europe. Leading
pharmaceutical companies are expanding their
businesses with a view to developing the export 
market. A number of new pharmaceutical companies
have been established recently which are equipped 
with high-tech facilities and skilled professionals.

The light engineering sector is playing an important
role in employment generation and poverty alleviation
through endogenous technology. It consists of small and
medium-sized light engineering industries scattered
across the country which have been producing 
import-substitution products. The product lines consist 
of 25 245 diverse items. Machinery and spare parts
produced by entrepreneurs are supplied to various mills

336

South Asia chapter [16] [P3]:Layout 1  18/10/10  19:31  Page 337

and factories. Other products include ferries, railways,
power plants and vehicles for the transport sector.
Around 40 000 light engineering industries are operating
all over the country. They are engaged in the production
and manufacturing of highly value-added engineered
goods and services with an annual turnover of more than
US$ 1.2 million. In recognition of this fact, the
government declared light engineering a ‘thrust sector’ 
in its Industrial Policy of 2005. Moreover, in the
government’s Export Policy of 2007, light engineering
was identified as one of the ‘highest priority sectors’. 
The policy provided a 10% cash incentive for the export
of light engineering products.

Bangladesh has a substantial domestic leather industry
that is mostly export-oriented. Some leather is exported in
the form of ready-made garments but this tends to be
confined to a small export-trade in ‘Italian-made’ garments
for the US market. Footwear is more important in terms of
added value and is the fastest-growing sector for leather
products. Presently, Bangladesh meets the leather
requirements of 2–3% of the world market. Most of the
livestock base for this production is domestic: it is
estimated that 1.8% of the world’s cattle and 3.7% of the
world’s goats are raised in Bangladesh. Their hides and
skins have a good international reputation. FDI in this
sector and in the production of tanning chemicals appears
to be highly rewarding. Bangladesh has the potential to
become an off-shore location for the manufacture of low-
cost, high-quality leather and leather goods. It has the basic
raw materials, a large and inexpensive labour force and
enjoys a tariff concession facility under the agreements
mentioned earlier which limits the size of tariffs that major
importing countries can impose. 

Weaving S&T into the national culture
The Ministry of Science and Information and Communication
Technology is promoting S&T as a way of bringing about
positive social change and balanced socio-economic
development in Bangladesh. S&T is being harnessed to foster
sustainable use of the environment, ecosystem and
resources, on the one hand, and contribute to the global
pool of knowledge, on the other. The overall aim is make S&T
part of the national culture.

In 2009, the government approved the country’s
Information and Communication Technology Policy. 
It falls within the national vision of raising the profile of
the nation to that of a middle-income country within a

South Asia

decade, a feat that would require more than doubling the
current level of per-capita GNP. The policy considers that
the country’s annual growth rate can be pushed to above
7.5% of GNP through extensive use of ICTs. 

The ten objectives of the policy are to: 
I ensure social equity; 
I increase productivity across all economic sectors,

including agriculture; 

I foster transparency, accountability and efficiency in the

delivery of services to citizens; 

I ensure computer literacy at all levels of education and

public service; 

I facilitate innovation and the creation of intellectual

property;

I enlarge the pool of world-class ICT professionals to

cater to both local and overseas employment
opportunities;

I strengthen exports in software;
I improve health care and ensure universal access as a

public service obligation;

I enhance the creation and adoption of environment-

friendly green technologies, ensure the safe disposal of
toxic wastes and minimize disaster response times; 

I enable effective climate-change management

programmes.

Nepal
Challenges for higher education 
The significance of basic sciences in strengthening 
the overall S&T capability has not yet been properly
recognized in Nepal, according to Bajracharya et al.
(2006). For them, ‘little priority is given to higher
education in basic sciences, compared to higher
education in technical subjects such as engineering,
medicine, agriculture and forestry’. They argue that this
attitude has been largely responsible for the lack of
development of an adequate S&T capability in Nepal.
Moreover, despite the growing opportunities for higher
education in technical subjects, many students still
venture abroad to India, China, Bangladesh, Australia
and the USA. Despite this trend, the number of scientists
and engineers in Nepal quadrupled between 1995 and
2008 from 8 236 to 34 880 (Nepal Academy of Science
and Technology, 2009).

Until 1986, Tribhuvan University was Nepal’s only
university offering higher education and research in S&T
fields. In 1991, this public institution was joined by a

private university, Kathmandu University, followed by two
other private institutions in 1994: Purbanchal University
and Pokhara University. The most recent addition is the
Nepal Academy of Medical Sciences, set up by the
government in 2004. 

Today, Tribhuvan University still produces over three-
quarters of S&T personnel and nearly 40% of the country’s
master’s and PhD holders in S&T fields, most of whom are
destined for university teaching. The low number of PhD
students is a problem (Bajracharya et al., 2006).

Three-quarters of the Nepalese students enrolled in S&T
fields attend Tribhuvan University, where they represent
nearly 16% of student admissions. Demand for higher
education is growing: in 2004, the university counted 
25 564 students enrolled in S&T fields, up from 19 056 in
2000. The university conducts academic programmes in
S&T through its five technical institutes: the Institutes of
Science and Technology, Engineering, Medicine,
Agriculture and Animal Sciences, and Forestry. 

338

The Institute of Science and Technology had by far the
highest student enrollment in 2004 (18 891), followed by
the Institute of Engineering (4050) and the Institute of
Medicine (1 543) [Bajracharya et al., 2006].

Between 1990 and 2004, the government made ‘huge
investments’ (5.7 billion rupees) in the Institutes of
Medicine, Engineering, Forestry and Agriculture to build
infrastructure, with the lion’s share going to the Institute of
Medicine (40%). Although the Institute of Science and
Technology received the second-biggest budgetary
allocation (26%), its student roll is also much higher than
that of the other four institutes (Bajracharya et al., 2006).

There are as many as 75 campuses under the Institute of
Science and Technology. They offer programmes in
zoology, botany, chemistry, physics, mathematics, statistics,
microbiology, meteorology, geology, environmental
science, computer sciences and food technology. In 2005,
the institute planned to introduce programmes in energy
studies and technology; material sciences; remote sensing;
water resource studies; biotechnology; dairy technology;
mountain risk engineering and computer applications.

Tribhuvan University attracts the bulk of students because 
its tuition fees are lower than those of private institutions. This
forces most of the university’s campuses to admit more
students than they can actually accommodate. The overall
percentage of investment in higher education has been
declining even as the cost of science education has risen. 
This obliges the university to generate revenue itself but any
proposal to raise tuition fees has met with opposition from the
student unions. The lack of investment has resulted in poor
laboratory and library facilities on most of the science
campuses. It has also meant that the university could not
diversify academic programmes, leading to an oversupply of
graduates in some disciplines. The low salaries of university
professors have also affected morale and encouraged
professors to take on part-time jobs on different campuses –
including private campuses – to make ends meet
(Bajracharya et al., 2006).

Fostering development-oriented research
A mountainous country, Nepal has little arable land, yet
the majority of the active population works in agriculture
and forestry. About one-third of Nepal’s export earnings
come from agriculture and forest products. The other
major sources of revenue are tourism and remittances
from Nepalese living abroad. The small manufacturing

Box 5: The Nepal Development Research Institute

A non-profit, non-governmental
organization, the Nepal Development
Research Institute (NDRI) was
established in 2007 to conduct quality
research on issues of relevance to
Nepalese society. It also provides
consultancy and training services.

Research focuses on four

multidisciplinary areas: policy analysis
on the national economy; infra-
structure policy and planning; poverty
reduction and sustainable livelihoods;
climate change, agriculture and
renewable natural resources.

In October 2009, NDRI was

implementing the following 
key projects:

■ an assessment of the role of
community forests in CO2
sequestration, biodiversity and land
use change. This project was being
carried out in the Teraj and Hills
Districts of Nepal, with funding
from the Asia–Pacific Network for
Global Change Research in Japan;

■ an evaluation of assistance for

vulnerable populations living in 
18 districts who were affected by
high food prices, conflict and
natural disasters. The study was
being carried out by NDRI in
partnership with the United
Nations World Food Programme;

■ household surveys for the World

Food Programme’s research
projects on food markets in mid-
western Nepal and cash for work
in Far West Nepal;

■ hazard and vulnerability mapping,

as well as the documenting of
good practices in disaster risk
management and adaptation to
climate change adaptation. This
project was being implemented 
in partnership with the United
Nations Food and Agriculture
Organization.

sector tends to be limited to labour-intensive industries
such as handicrafts, garment- and carpet-making, 
agri-products and the like (Bajracharya et al., 2006).

■ enhancing local technology;
■ expanding the water sector and meteorological

services (Bajracharya et al., 2006).

Nepal has set itself the target of reducing the number of
people living below the poverty line from over 38% in
2004 to 10% by 2017. Poverty alleviation was a special
focus of the Tenth Plan (2002–2007), which sought to
attain this goal by ‘enhancing production and productivity
through the maximum utilization of S&T’ (Figure 6). 
The budget amounted to 234 million rupees (circa
US$ 3.2 million), up from 190 million rupees for the
previous Plan.

The Tenth Plan focused on:
■ mobilizing available physical and human resources and

giving special priority to S&T in tertiary education;
■ strengthening the institutional and administrative

sector to activate research agencies;

■ attracting private-sector participation in research; 
■ encouraging development-oriented, competitive research; 
■ incorporating information technology and biotechnology;
■ creating an environment conducive to technology

transfer and foreign investment;

■ disseminating information on the results of scientific

research and its applications;

■ producing highly skilled personnel;

Despite its abundant rivers, Nepal uses only a small
percentage of its hydro-electric potential, which reaches
less than 40% of the population. A major project to
develop hydropower was concluded with India in 2006
but the project never got off the ground. In 2007, Nepal
won the prestigious Ashden Award for replacing diesel-
powered mills with water-powered ones. It had won a
similar award two years earlier for making biogas out of
cow dung. The biogas project even sold carbon credits to
the World Bank under the Clean Development Mechanism
of the Kyoto Protocol (Khadka, 2009).

Nepal formed a high-level Commission on Climate
Change in 2009 under the chairmanship of the Prime
Minister which was charged with preparing an action
plan for adaptation. The plan will emphasize the concept
of sustainable and clean development and accord high
priority to renewable energy to generate ‘green’
employment. In presenting its programmes and policies
for 2009–2010 to Parliament, the government observed
that it would accord high priority ‘to the expeditious
implementation of some large-scale hydropower
projects’ (Government of Nepal, 2009).

UNESCO SCIENCE REPORT 2010

The government decided to prepare a three-year Interim
Development Plan (IDP) in place of an Eleventh Five-Year
Plan, in order to map the country’s development to 2010
during the transition period from a monarchy to a
parliamentary democracy. The IDP’s main objectives are to
contribute to the national goal of poverty alleviation by
improving living standards through the development and
utilization of S&T. The IDP also aims to build national
capacity by strengthening the institutional framework of
the S&T sector and making production and services more
competitive via R&D. With a target of annual economic
growth of 5.5%, the IDP has adopted a strategy of
involving stakeholders in the institutional development of
S&T by mobilizing academia and the private sector.

In terms of institutional capacity, Nepal counts some 
170 organizations involved in S&T, the majority of which
fall under government ministries (see also Box 5). As we
have seen earlier, Nepal now has five institutions of higher
learning and research related to S&T (see page 337). The
Research Centre for Applied Science and Technology
(RECAST) is the main R&D wing of Tribhuvan University.
RECAST conducts R&D into renewable sources of energy
(solar energy, biomass briquetting, biofuels and improved
cooking stoves), natural dyes and other natural products,
crop science and medicinal chemistry. Recent major
research activities include: exploration and utilization 
of renewable oil resources; bioprospecting of ethno-
medicinal plants of Nepal for conservation of biological
and cultural resources; development of a gassifier stove
for domestic use; and dissemination of a programme of
appropriate technology for micro- and small enterprise
development in Nepal (Bajracharya et al., 2006).

In recent years, the private sector has been contributing to
building technological capability in the energy sector via
solar water heaters, water turbines and multi-purpose
power units. Companies include Balaju Yantra Shala, the
Development Consulting Service and Butwal Technical
Institute. Private businesses have emerged in software
development and IT, telecommunications and cable
technology (Bajracharya et al., 2006).

The Ministry of Environment, Science and Technology set 
up an Information Technology Park at Dhulikhel in 2003. 
For several years, the 270 million rupees (circa US$ 3.6 million)
facility lay idle until International Business Machines (IBM)
Corporation decided to set up a research centre within the
park. The centre was inaugurated in October 2009 by Prime

340

Minister Madhav Kumar Nepal and the chairman of Nepal’s
Information Technology High-Level Commission. IBM has
employed eight researchers in the centre to develop new
software for use in business (Tech Nepalko Info, 2009).

In 2005, the Ministry of Environment, Science and
Technology6 promulgated a national S&T policy after
presenting the draft policy to the Fourth National
Conference on Science and Technology organized by the
Nepal Academy of Science and Technology7 (Bajracharya
et al., 2006). In 2010, this S&T policy was under revision. 

Pakistan
Higher education reforms
Pakistan is the world’s sixth-most populous nation with 
166 million inhabitants, more than half of whom are younger
than 19 years. This demographic situation is a challenge but
also an opportunity. Amid a host of problems related to
regional conflicts, natural disasters, political instability and
the turmoil and violence that have gripped the country in
recent years, one positive trend has emerged: the nation has
dramatically increased its investment in higher education
and scientific research (Rahman, 2009).

Pakistan’s reforms in higher education were initiated in 
2003, a year after the Higher Education Commission (HEC)
was established by Presidential Ordinance to reform the
country’s ailing higher education system. The plan of action
implemented by the HEC over the past five years has focused
on addressing issues related to access, quality and relevance. 

Access is being addressed by providing talented students
with greater opportunities for higher education through the
expansion of universities from 94 in 2005 to 128 in 2008,
as well as the promotion of high-quality distance learning
programmes through a virtual university established in
2001. This virtual university has since expanded its
programmes and counted 35 000 enrolled students in 2009. 

To address other challenges, a core strategic plan was
drafted in 2002–2003 to implement reforms which include
the following:

■ programmes to reverse brain drain, under which the
monthly salaries of faculty members increased to an

average of US$ 3 000–5 000. Under its Foreign Faculty
Hiring Programme, the HEC has managed to attract about
500 highly qualified faculty from abroad to take up
positions at universities across the country, including
expatriate Pakistani scholars and international experts;

aggressively pursued by providing merit-based
scholarships for training approximately 2 400 PhD
students per year at universities in developed countries; 

I the HEC has also established a Quality Assurance

Agency and Quality Assurance Cells in the country’s
universities to enforce sound standards in higher
education and encourage continual upgrading
through the implementation of international
benchmarks. HEC funded 742 development projects 
at a cost of US$ 4.2 billion from 2007 to 2008. Figure 7
outlines priority sectors and fields of research. 

Centralized equipment facilities providing access to
advanced scientific instrumentation have been
established at 20 national centres for researchers from
universities across the country. Moreover, to ensure the
relevance of higher education to national objectives, the
HEC has also promoted endogenous PhD programmes at
local universities, resulting in a 56% increase in the
enrollment of researchers. Joint research projects
between university and industry are encouraged. 

The past five years of targeted reforms in the fields of
engineering, IT and biological sciences have left their mark:
there has been a leap in university enrollment from 
135 123 students in 2003 to 741 009 in 2008. Female
enrollment grew from 36% of the total student cohort in
2001 to 48.7% in 2007. Women comprise as much as 70% 
of total enrollment in MPhil and PhD programmes. A
substantial rise in the number of postgraduate research
students has resulted in a 60% increase in internationally
co-authored publications from Pakistani institutions of
higher learning (see also Box 6). 

Knowledge hubs in Pakistan
Despite a long history of developments in philosophy,
science, technology and manufacturing predating Roman
times, modern science was brought to the South Asian region
by colonial rulers. During the British Raj in India, the British
established a number of universities and about 30 research
laboratories in the agriculture and health sectors across the

region. Following partition in 1947, Pakistan inherited just one
university and three small agriculture stations. 

The scientific research infrastructure has since expanded in
Pakistan. Within this framework of institutions, regional
knowledge hubs have emerged in the cities of Karachi,
Lahore, Faisalabad, Sialkot (Box 7) and Islamabad. Karachi,
Pakistan’s most densely populated port with a population
of 21 million, is the largest industrial city with a focus on the

Box 6: Pakistan’s research collaboration with China and the USA

Pakistan and China have enjoyed
strong political and economic ties for
the past few decades. Both countries
have also collaborated on a number of
research projects in various fields of
S&T. One landmark project was the
construction of the world’s highest
highway, the Karakoram Highway,
considered the eighth wonder of the
world. Pakistani and Chinese engineers
jointly constructed this highway in the
Himalayan mountains connecting
Pakistan and China through the old
Silk Road over a period of 20 years. The
project was completed in 1986. 

A second landmark project is the
recent joint production of a jet fighter,
Thunder, which, after successful
completion of its test flight in 2008,
has been approved for commercial
production. 

Pakistani and US scientific

collaboration is facilitated by an
agreement signed by the presidents
of both countries in 2003. Under this
agreement, both countries contribute
to a common S&T fund which is
jointly managed by the National
Academy of Sciences in the USA and
by the Higher Education Commission
and Ministry of Science and
Technology in Pakistan. Each year,
proposals for research collaboration
are invited with at least one US and
one Pakistani scientist as principal
investigators. The proposals undergo
peer review in both countries and are
selected on merit. 

This programme has resulted not
only in capacity-building of Pakistan’s
laboratories but also in the joint
discovery of a vaccine to prevent a

deadly disease caused by tick bites
which afflicts those working with
animal herds in the southern region of
Sindh in Pakistan. 

Another success story is the

Pakistan telemedicine programme.
Two Pakistani doctors were trained by
US specialists to be master trainers
who in turn trained a critical number
of medical professionals. Telemedicine
services are now being offered to
patients living in remote villages via
28 centres. Telemedicine also helped
save several lives in the earthquake-
hit cities and towns in 2005.

textile, leather and automobile industries. The city houses 
29 universities and degree-awarding institutes operating in
both the public and private sectors. These include the
famous Aga Khan University of Medical Sciences and Sindh
Urology Institute, which are recognized the world over for
training high-quality medical graduates and for research in
renal diseases respectively. The Institute for Business
Administration and HEJ Research Institute of Chemistry at

Karachi University are known respectively for training high-
quality management graduates and for top-quality
researchers in chemistry. The 32 R&D organizations in 
Karachi include the laboratories of the Space and Upper
Atmospheric Research Commission (SUPARCO), the National
Oceanography Institute and the laboratories of the Pakistan
Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (PCSIR) working
in the areas of energy, biomedical and leather research. 

Box 7: Initiatives to promote industry in Sialkot

The city of Sialkot in Pakistan is well-
known for the production and export
of surgical instruments, leather
goods, textiles, musical instruments
and cutlery. Sialkot is the third-largest
industrial hub in the province of
Punjab after Lahore and Faisalabad. 
It is Pakistan’s second-largest 
export-earner after Karachi. 

Sialkot’s entrepreneurs have

collaborated on a number of
successful projects to make the city a
highly desirable location for industry.
These include setting up a dry port 
in Sambrial; raising private funds to
improve city roads and drainage;
sealing roads on industrial estates;
locating tanneries in a specialized zone;

and providing toxic waste treatment.
Sialkot’s commercial and industrial
interests are being served through the
building of an international airport for
cargo flights completely financed by
the private sector.

The city of Lahore, situated at the heart of the province of
Punjab, is home to 25 universities, institutes and 20 R&D
organizations. This city has emerged as the regional IT hub
and has attracted a significant amount of foreign
investment in this field. Two centres have been liberally
funded from the public purse. The first is the Abdus Salam
School of Mathematical Sciences at Government College
University in Lahore; it has attracted top-class
mathematicians from different countries to form a
knowledge cluster. The second is the Centre of Excellence in
Molecular Biology at Punjab University; it has several
postgraduate students on its roll and has established a
world-class virology laboratory. 

Jointly funded by the provincial government of Punjab and
the federal government, the Abdus Salam School of
Mathematical Sciences was established in 2003 to honour
Pakistani scientist Abdus Salam, who was awarded the
Nobel Prize for Physics in 1979 jointly with Steven Weinberg
and Sheldon Lee Glashow. The institution has made
remarkable progress in a short period. It has an
international faculty of 36 PhDs, most of whom come from
Eastern Europe. The school had 93 PhD students on its roll
in 2009 and has attracted a large number of doctoral and
postdoctoral students from different countries. 

The privately funded Lahore University of Management
Sciences produces top-class graduates in management-
related studies. The Metal and Material Science Laboratories
of the PCSIR provide services to light engineering industries
located in the neighbouring cities of Sialkot, Gujranwala
and Gujrat. These three cities are known for their traditional
strengths in light engineering sectors and are commonly
referred to as the technology triangle of Pakistan.

Islamabad, the federal capital, and its twin city, 
Rawalpindi, had only three universities until 1990. 
These have now expanded to 16 universities and 34 R&D
organizations, including laboratories of the National
Agriculture Research Commission, the Pakistan Atomic
Energy Commission and the laboratories of the 
National Defense Complex. 

Faisalabad is known for agro-based industries and 
textile manufacturing industries. It has four universities,
including the Agriculture University of Faisalabad and a
Textile University. In addition, 20 research institutes, mostly
involved in research in the fields of agriculture and
biotechnology, provide services to agro-based industries.

South Asia

Sri Lanka
Towards a framework for higher education reforms 
Like most South Asian countries, Sri Lanka faces the
challenge of improving the quality of education at all levels.
The challenge is particularly acute for higher education,
where issues encompass not only improving access, quality
and relevance but also wider reforms to introduce
international standards, better management and
governance, as well as greater flexibility and adaptability to
meet labour market demands. 

Sri Lanka loses many of its highly qualified professionals to
brain drain. According to a recent World Bank study (2009),
Sri Lanka’s higher education enrollment of 6% of the age
cohort is underestimated. The recent promotion of distance
education programmes is expected to have increased
access to higher education to almost 23% of the 18–25 age
group. The quality and relevance of higher education
remains a matter of concern, as few institutions are
providing education that is up to international standards.
Research efforts are also concentrated in just three or four
universities, the Industrial Technology Institute and some
research institutes conducting agricultural research.  

The Sri Lankan government has realized the importance of
human capital for survival in an increasingly competitive,
knowledge-based global economy. It has entrusted the
National Education Commission – established in 1991 – with
the task of developing a policy framework in collaboration
with the Ministry of Planning, Ministry of Finance and the
University Grants Commission. In 2009, the Commission was
consulting all stakeholders, such as academics, researchers
and development planners, with a view to formulating a
framework for higher education reforms (World Bank, 2009). 

A vision for Sri Lankan science
Sri Lanka is an island economy with a population of 
20 million and GDP of US$ 40.6 billion (2008). It has the
highest per capita income (US$ 2 013) in the region after
the Maldives and Iran (Table 1). 

Sri Lanka was the first country in South Asia to liberalize
its economy in 1979. Its share of global exports in 2003
exceeded its share of global GDP, indicating that it is an
export-driven economy (Dahlman, 2007). Over the past 
20 years, the composition of the economy has changed,
with the share of the services sector rising to the
detriment of the agriculture sector, which contributed just
13% to GDP in 2009 (Figure 1). The potential for further

economic growth will depend on the country’s ability to
overcome internal political problems, bridge regional
inequalities by widening access to economic gains and
increase investment in ICT infrastructure, education and
scientific research to achieve productivity gains through
innovation (World Bank, 2009).

The higher education and research infrastructure currently
comprises 62 institutions. The 19 state-controlled
universities include one university working under the
Ministry of Defense. There are 11 R&D centres, the
remainder of infrastructure being made up of colleges and
institutes. For many years, Sri Lanka was credited with
providing some of the best higher education in the region.
This achievement could not be sustained, however, due to
decades of internal conflict which resulted in the major
share of GDP being spent on combating terrorism.
Expenditure on education and on R&D also stagnated for
several years, resulting in lower standards of education and
having an adverse impact on skills development
programmes and the training of engineers and scientists.

Of note is that Sri Lanka leads other countries in the region
for the World Bank’s Knowledge Economy Index (KEI) 
[Table 8]. The KEI is calculated using four pillars of 
the knowledge economy, namely: incentive and the
institutional regime; education and human resources; the
innovation system and; ICT infrastructure. Iran and Pakistan
have also shown progress in these four areas since 1995.

In 2009, the Ministry of Science and Technology launched
its Vision 2020 for transforming Sri Lanka into a scientifically
and technologically advanced country. Within this vision, a
new STI policy was formulated which was in the process of

review and consensus-building at the time of writing the
present chapter in early 2010. The new policy lays emphasis
on:

I fostering a science and innovation culture for every

citizen; 

I training a higher number of scientists and technologists;
I achieving self-reliance in S&T by acquiring technology

and adapting and developing it for increased
competitiveness; 

I ensuring quality standards of S&T institutions and

national certification and accreditation bodies; 
I ensuring sustainable development through the

conservation of the country’s natural resources and
environmental protection; 

I promotion of basic and applied research in the fields of
nanotechnology, biotechnology, materials science and
electronics;

Box 8: The Sri Lanka Institute of Nanotechnology

Established in 2008, the Sri Lanka
Institute of Nanotechnology (SLINTEC)
is a joint venture between the National
Science Foundation and Sri Lankan
corporate giants that include Brandix,
Dialog, Hayleys, Loadstar and MAS. 
The Institute is housed within a
futuristic complex in the Blyagama
Export Promotion Zone. SLINTEC

laboratories are equipped and staffed
with some of the most advanced,
cutting-edge research equipment and
a research staff that includes 20 PhDs
who qualified abroad. 

Research at SLINTEC focuses on
the integration of nano-scale devices
and materials into complex
nanosystems that will elevate the

global competitiveness of products.
SLINTEC claims access to a global
resource base and takes an industry-
focused approach. The institute aims
to become the regional hub for
nanotechnology research and
intellectual property rights acquisition.

I encouraging science-based entrepreneurship through

appropriate incentives and regulations, including
intellectual property rights and the promotion of S&T at
the grassroots level.

Current GERD in Sri Lanka is reported to be about 
0.2% of GDP (Figure 2), 70% of which is considered 
non-development expenditure. The new STI policy
envisages raising GERD to 1% of GDP and increasing the
number of researchers from 93 per million population
(Table 4) to at least 948 per million population. Enrollment
in engineering will be encouraged to achieve a fourfold
increase in the number of graduates. Four institutions
under the Ministry of Science and Technology have been
assigned the task of implementing the STI policy. These
are the National Engineering and Development
Corporation, the Industrial Technology Institute, the
National Science Foundation and the Arthur C. Clark
Institute of Modern Technologies. The ministry has posted
the implementation strategy for the STI policy and
progress achieved thus far on its website. 

The initiative for establishing a world-class institute of
nanotechnology as a public–private partnership has
received positive feedback from international agencies
like the World Bank review team, which termed it a step 
in the right direction (Box 8). 

Another initiative promotes S&T at the grassroots level.
The Sri Lankan government is implementing 300 Science
and Technology Vidatha Centers in villages. Staffed by
science graduates, these centres are expected to provide
training and consultancy services to entrepreneurs for the
commercialization of local research and locally developed
technologies.

Sri Lanka’s new STI policy and plans were reviewed by
World Bank experts and their findings were presented 
at a conference held on 15 October 2009 in Colombo.
The study identifies weaknesses in organizations
implementing the policy. These organizations are unable
to hire talented staff owing to low salary structures and
minimal opportunities for training due to lack of funds,
the study observes. There are also problems related to the
fact that institutions employ an inadequate number of
technicians and a proportionally high number of non-
technical support staff. The World Bank study
recommended major reforms in the higher education
sector to create a merit-based national cadre of

researchers that would involve the Sri Lankan diaspora in
reforming higher education institutions and restructuring
R&D organizations to make them market-driven rather
than supply-oriented. The study also suggested
strengthening Sri Lankan institutes providing
accreditation services related to metrology, standards,
quality and testing.

Concerning the establishment of a national innovation
system, the study recommended that STI policy be
aligned with the overarching national development
policies. It proposed creating demand for STI by
promoting risk-sharing between government and
industry through public–private partnerships, the
promotion of contract research and the provision of tax
credits, tax deductions and investment allowances to the
productive and services sectors for the purposes of
fostering R&D and innovation.

In 2009, the Sri Lankan government approved a project
assigned to the Munasinghe Institute for Development
(MIND) for aligning the national technology and
innovation policy with the National Sustainable
Development Strategy (2007). This project is intended to
support the implementation plan and facilitate formal
adoption of the STI policy. The project strives to orient STI
towards meeting socio-economic challenges related to
sustainable development, improving health and
education and the general well-being of the population,
as well as other challenges such as ethnic conflict,
environmental issues and natural disasters.

CONCLUSION

The building of S&T capabilities is considered essential for
economic growth and development. The technology gap
between South Asia and the developed world cannot be
bridged by simply importing technology from other
countries. Rather, it requires that the governments of South
Asian countries invest in:

I building sound educational and scientific infrastructure;
I training a critical mass of scientists, engineers and skilled

technicians;

I appropriate regulation for the protection of IPRs and;
I the formulation of public policies to support a continual
learning process in private firms so that they can master
the tacit knowledge attached to technology transfer.

In addition, South Asia has been unable to exploit its
regional trade potential. The cultural and linguistic ties and
geographical proximity of South Asian countries should
facilitate regional trade. Trade creates a demand for
technology and innovation and links people in many
different ways. South Asian countries have a competitive
edge in a variety of services and products with potential for
trade within the region. Furthermore, there are location-
specific advantages in the industrial clusters that exist in all
South Asian countries, particularly in India and Pakistan.
Most of these clusters require new management and
organizational techniques to integrate existing knowledge
and new technologies in their production processes. They
need to seek technological alliances regionally and globally
to gain a competitive advantage (Dahlman, 2007).

The national innovation systems of South Asian countries
remain underdeveloped. Overall, Pakistan, Bangladesh and
Sri Lanka seem better at producing basic knowledge than
commercializing it. In general, the emphasis of public-funded
R&D has been on military and space research rather than on
industrial research, health or other areas of research where
innovation can improve the quality of life for most of the
population. South Asian countries require aggressive STI and
competition policies and strong institutional infrastructure to
improve co-ordination and cohesion between the various
public and private institutions and enterprises. Building
strong knowledge networks within each country and at the
regional level, and linking these to international networks,
may result in the knowledge transfer and knowledge
accumulation countries need to become competitive in an
increasingly knowledge-intensive global economy.

INTRODUCTION

In Iran, science, technology and innovation (STI) policy
hinges on the country’s status as an oil economy. Home to
the second-biggest known reserves in the world after
Saudi Arabia, Iran has invested in the oil industry to the
point where receipts now represent more than four-fifths
of GDP. No discussion of the evolution of STI policy in Iran
since 2000 would thus be complete without an analysis of
the impact of Iran’s oil economy on STI policy. 

In the present chapter, we shall argue that oil receipts can
play a perverse role in S&T policy and development. This is
because the windfall from oil revenue tends to stimulate
consumerism and create a schism between consumers
and the scientific community. With S&T policy relegated to
the back seat, bureaucratic preferences take precedence
over the development of science as a public good. 

We shall also argue that an oil economy need not be an
obstacle to the development of science and technology
(S&T). Recent trends in planning and public policy-making
demonstrate that Iranian officials plan to foster S&T,
although the effectiveness of this policy will depend on 
its socio-economic orientation. 

Iranians have a positive attitude towards science, so there
is no major cultural barrier to the evolution of S&T.
Scientific advances are easily accepted within the religious
and political spheres. Yet, despite this positive attitude,
science is neither an important part of economic life, nor
considered an intellectual right. 

Attitudes towards science are largely influenced by cultural
and, to some extent, political considerations. As science is
recognized as being the determining factor in the
efficiency of Iran’s political system, the elite has tended to
mainstream scientific progress in its political discourse. As
a consequence, expenditure on research and development
(GERD) and research budgets in higher education have
largely been spared from cuts, even in hard times. 

Over the past decade or so, Iran has reacted to the
imposition of trade embargoes by some Western countries
by developing its own scientific and economic
infrastructure. This has entailed expanding higher education
and spawned the Southern Pars Oil Projects, national
projects for the production of steel, cement and so on, and
the local production of goods for domestic consumption,

such as cars or electrical appliances. Nevertheless,  research
and development (R&D) have failed to target market needs.
Iran has instead chosen to focus on such fields as peaceful
nuclear technology, nanotechnology, satellite launching, 
the reproduction of stem cells, animal cloning and so on. 
As a result, S&T policy remains insulated from changes in 
the economic conjuncture. 

High oil receipts in recent years have been a boon for
science. At the same time, however, this natural wealth has
divorced science from socio-economic needs and favoured
government intervention in S&T policy: as much as 73% of
research is government-funded. As we shall see later, the
steep climb in oil revenue in 2004–2005 has been followed
by a spending spree on science and social welfare but also
by a burgeoning bureaucracy. This situation has not only
favoured a science pull instead of a technology push; it has
also nurtured the domination of S&T policy by a scientific
elite in academia. This dual phenomenon explains the low
contribution of S&T policy to industrial development and
the high rate of resource-based exports for an industrial
economy, about 50% (Iranian Centre for Statistics, 2004).

In addition to the country’s economic dependence on oil,
S&T policy in Iran is typified by an interventionist
bureaucracy which can lead to wastage of public funds.
The greatest weakness, however, is the lack of orientation
of STI policy towards problem-solving. Although the focus
of scientific research is gradually shifting towards national
problems, much of policy research in Iran demonstrates
no strong relevance to national issues. Demand push for
research and technology, a knowledge economy and
problem-oriented research are all fashionable concepts in
S&T policy, yet it would seem that the interrelation of
these concepts and their integration into the economy
receive little consideration in the policy-making process in
Iran, despite their social relevance. 

S&T policy-making in Iran needs to pay attention to such
notions as technology diffusion, standardization, legal
system reform, commercialization of research, establishing
a trade-off system, institutional reform, communication and
so on, if it is to make a real connection between scientific
research and society. In the policy agenda, government
preferences and the science pull approach should come
after the demand push for research. Iran needs to take
progressing towards a knowledge economy more seriously
because basing the economy on oil could prevent a strong
relationship from developing between science and wealth.

UNESCO SCIENCE REPORT 2010

SOCIO-ECONOMIC SITUATION
Healthy growth in GDP 
Iran has enjoyed a healthy rate of economic growth since
2001, with a peak in 2007 of 7.8% (Tables 1 and 2).
Overshadowing this performance, however, is an inflation
rate that has fluctuated between 10% and 25% since 2000.
As a result, Iran’s standing among its neighbours, such as
Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Pakistan, has oscillated at times. 

An economy dominated by oil  
The share of non-oil economic activities in GDP has
dropped during Iran’s fourth Five-Year Economic, Social and
Cultural Plan (2005–2009), compared to the previous plan.
In parallel, oil revenue has climbed to US$270 billion since
President Ahmadinejad took office in August 2005. One-
third of the economy is now dependent on oil, especially
since the downturn in the construction sector 
in 2009 caused by the global recession (Figure 1).

GDP per capita has grown rapidly, from PPP US$ 6 820 in
2000 to PPP US$ 11 844 in 2007. Over the same period,
Iran's human development ranking likewise improved
from 98th to 88th place. This places Iran near the top of the
list of countries with medium human development,
between Georgia and Thailand (UNDP, 2009).

Slower population growth and better literacy
In the past decade, population growth has slowed from
1.6% per annum in 2000 to 1.4% in 2008. It is estimated
that this rate will further decline to 1.3% by 2015 when Iran
will have a population of about 79.4 million. Iran’s young
population could be an opportunity for the country’s
development but the high rate of unemployment could
also cause socio-economic problems. 

According to UNESCO (2010), 82% of Iranians over the age
of 15 years were literate in 2007, a figure projected to rise
to 88% by 2015. It is also expected that the literacy gap
between men and women will shrink: 23% of women
were illiterate in 2006, compared to 12% of men; the
projected figures for 2015 are 12% and 8% respectively. 
At university, women made up two-thirds of the student
body in 2009. 

Table 1: Socio-economic indicators for Iran, 2000–2007

The proportion of non-oil industrial sectors shrank to less
than one-fifth of total gross national income (GNI)
between 2002 and 2007 (Iranian Central Bank, 2007a).
These sectors include agriculture, industry and mining,
electricity, gas, water and construction (Figure 2). Only
mining managed to hold its own, even though it was
progressing from a low starting point: 0.7% of GDP in
2002 and 0.8% five years later. The share of oil, on the
other hand, nearly doubled, climbing from 15.1% in 2000
to 27.9% in 2007 (Iranian Central Bank, 2007b).

Imports represent an estimated 30% of GDP and exports
39% of GDP (2007). The share of goods and services in
imports has not changed since 2006 but has risen more than
7% for exports. Exports of goods and services can be broken
down into raw materials (88%), industrial products (9%) and
advanced technologies (3%) [Iranian Central Bank, 2008].

Between 2004 and 2008, the share of oil revenue allocated
to the government rose to US$60 billion. By 2007, the
increase represented four times that forecast for the period
of the Fourth Plan (2005–2009). Since the revolution of
1979, reducing government funding via taxes and non-oil
revenue had become a priority. This led successive

governments to assign a US$16 billion ceiling for
government withdrawals of oil revenue during the
country’s successive development programmes, especially
those since 1990.  Oil revenue in the eight years of
President Khatami’s government (1996–2004) climbed to
US$193 billion and in the first four years of President
Ahmadinejad’s government (2005–2009) to US$258 billion.

A trend towards privatization  
More than 60% of industrial production in Iran is supplied
by government companies. In 2006, the government
announced an ambitious Industrial Privatization
Programme to sell off the country’s major companies to the
private sector, such as the Ahwaz Steel Company or Iran’s
Communication Company. 

The financial sector remains dominated by state banks,
even though four private banks were established in early
2000 and major public banks were gradually being
privatized in 2009. Banks have become an important
source of funding for the private sector. In 2007, they
provided 94% of liquidities to private companies,
compared to just 4% in 1990. This increase implies that
the largely state-controlled banking system has been a
significant contributor to economic growth. Borrowing
facilities have grown along with the increase in the money
supply: 60% of deposits held in Iranian banks were made
available to borrowers in 1998, a share which had risen to
85% by 2007. The Iranian banking system has been
harnessed to help the country improve its competitive
advantage, upgrade technology and stimulate

productivity and economic growth. As a consequence of
being indexed on the economy, however, the banking
system has also become dependent on the oil economy.

A slowly shrinking income gap 
The income gap is shrinking in Iran but remains wide.
Whereas the richest citizens earned 22 times as much as
the poorest in 1990, this ratio had dropped to 17 by 2004.
This is higher than the ratio for Pakistan (8:1), Indonesia
(7:1) or Thailand (12:1). The picture is the same if we take
some developed countries: France (9:1), Switzerland (10:1)
and Germany (7:1) [Iranian Central Bank, 2008].

Some 4.5 million Iranians, or 1.5 million poor households,
are covered by government social welfare networks and
charities. Subsidies have a major impact on the economy.
One of the most important challenges for the Iranian
economy in recent years has been to reduce non-targeted
energy subsidies, which constitute 10% of GDP and do not
always go to those most in need. 

In all, 48 million Iranians are entitled to health insurance
provided by their private or government employer. 
A non-governmental charity, the Comit-e Emdad Imam
Khomeini, provides additional coverage for four million
poor. The country's social security system includes health
care, training, retirement and unemployment benefits, 
as well as subsidies for energy, food, housing and other
social services. 

S&T POLICY CHANGES AND TRENDS
SINCE 2000 

Even after 60 years of experience, there remains a lack of
methodological studies and critical reviews in policy-
making and planning in Iran, particularly when it comes 
to technology policy. This dearth of action plans,
programmes and overarching policies seems to be one 
of the main factors behind the difficulties encountered
in implementing  public policies up until now. S&T
planning, like other areas of policy-making in Iran, is
dominated by a comprehensive planning model which
ignores priorities, thereby preventing a focus on the 
most important problems. By refusing to prioritize, this
model leads to an unfair system of budget allocation
(Tofigh, 2006). 

The other characteristic of S&T policies is their inadequate
orientation towards problem-solving. A centralized,
bureaucratic approach to S&T policy-making allows
academic, bureaucratic or political elites to impose 
their own priorities on the science agenda. Theories and
models for S&T policies are ‘imported’ from abroad and
consequently ignore Iran’s socio-economic situation, 
be it the business world’s preoccupations, trade,
international collaboration or social problems. 
This weakens the private sector and could be a 
determing factor in the inefficacy and inefficiency of 
S&T policies. 

352

Iran chapter [9] [P3]:Layout 1  18/10/10  19:38  Page 353

As Shahmirzaii (1999) observes, ‘because of the presence
of a science pull approach in technological development,
aspects like industrial standardization, the engineering
regulatory system, support for design companies,
collaborative research between industrial enterprises, the
technical inspection system, export of technical and
engineering services, spreading new technologies to
industries … are ignored’.

As the highest authority for public policy-making in Iran, 
it is the Expediency Council which develops these ‘grand
policies’ for the Leader of the Islamic Republic of Iran,
including in the area of S&T.1 Grand policies are
elaborated to achieve the goals of the Vision document,
which identifies the mains goals of Iranian society for the
coming 20 years.

Once the grand policies have been developed by the
Expediency Council, they are officially communicated 
by the Leader of the Islamic Republic of Iran to the
legislative, executive and judicial branches. The grand
policies for S&T in the Fourth Development Plan
(2005–2009) are: 

I Development of the higher education system, research

centres, basic science and applied research;

I Optimization of education and research infrastructure,

together with improving scientific productivity and
efficiency; 

I Education and training of researchers and university

professors and, for those already in employment,
development of their scientific and practical skills and
ideological quality;

I Design of a system for ranking universities and

researchers based on criteria such as efficiency and
effectiveness, scientific productivity, applied research
and technological development, or the problem-
solving nature of their research;

1. According to the Constitution, the Leader ratifies grand policies after
‘consultation with the Expediency Council’ (Article 110). The members of
the Expediency Council are nominated by the Leader (Article 112),
currently Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. They are political personalities drawn
from different factions, as well as experts and officials such as the
president, the chief of the judiciary and the speaker of Parliament.  

Iran

I Collection of governmental and non-governmental

statistics, development of a scientific information
system. Creation of structures for applying the results
of scientific research;

I A greater role for universities and research centres in

promoting effective government and defending
religious beliefs;

I Development of technological capacities and

improvement of Iran’s position in global technology,
knowledge production, etc.

The Plan sets out to achieve these goals via action plans
and policy packages collectively known as ‘development
documents’ and a one-year budgeting system prepared
by the Management and Planning Organization, which
was renamed the President Deputy for Strategic
Monitoring2 in 2009.

As we have seen above, the centralization of S&T policy-
making is one of the characteristics of government. 
The aim of this centralization is to co-ordinate all agencies
and ministries. This is reflected in the transformation of
the Ministry of Science and Higher Education into the
Ministry of Science, Research and Technology (MoSRT) in
the Third Development Plan (2000–2004) and its new
mandate as co-ordinator of all scientific activities.
However, in order to co-ordinate different activities and
avoid overlap with the Ministry of Health and Medical
Education, the Ministry of Energy and the Ministry of
Agriculture, not to mention the many other institutions
with a mandate for S&T, a new post was created in 2005,
that of President Deputy for Science and Technology. This
deputy reports to the president and is responsible for co-
ordinating all S&T activities for which the budget and
planning are centralized. Up until the creation of this post,
the ministerial Supreme Council of Science, Research and
Technology had fulfilled this role but had failed to fully
achieve its objectives.

The other objective of centralization is to strengthen the
national innovation system. This system is perceived as a
means of avoiding the dispersal of public policies and
budget wastage by facilitating interaction between

2. The President Deputy is a full administration that is not subordinated to
any ministry. On the contrary, the various ministries are expected to co-
ordinate their work with that of the President Deputy.

multiple systems and sub-systems such as the national
education and economic systems. 

Policy-making in S&T is executed by different institutions
that include the President Deputy for Science and
Technology, MoSRT and the Ministry of Health and Medical
Education. Although this demonstrates broad-based
attention to S&T issues, the complex co-ordination
mechanism and division of tasks this necessitates can
complicate the execution of S&T policy.

R&D INPUT
Growth in R&D expenditure
GERD rose by 41% in 2004, 64% in 2005 and 65% in 2006.
According to the UNESCO Institute for Statistics, Iran
devoted 5.1 billion rials to R&D in 2002, 8.3 billion in 2004
and as much as 13.7 billion in 2006. This translates into a
GERD/GDP ratio of 0.67% in 2006, compared to 0.55% seven
years earlier (Figure 3). More than 74% of GERD is provided
by the government, the remainder coming from business

(14%) and higher education (11%). Interestingly, the role of
business R&D has even declined somewhat in recent years, 
in favour of the higher education sector (Figure 4).

When we compare Iran with a non-oil economy like Turkey, the
reality supports the hypothesis that an oil economy has a
negative impact on the business sector. In Turkey, business
expenditure on R&D made up 48% of total GERD in 2007 (up
from 41% in 2002), compared to just 14% in Iran (see page 205).

TRENDS IN HUMAN RESOURCES

A gender imbalance that favours women
The share of female students in higher education has risen
steadily from 45% in 2000 to 52% in 2007 (Figure 5) and
even more than 65% in 2009, according to preliminary data.
Consequently, public policy-makers need to acknowledge
the changing roles of men and women in Iranian society by
facilitating career opportunities for women and fostering a
supportive cultural climate for women wishing to combine 
a career with raising a family. 

A strong demand for higher education
For the past 30 years, Iran has been expanding its university
admission capacity. By the turn of the century, universities had
a capacity of about 160 000 students. By 2009, this number
had risen to 1 500 000 students. At the graduate level, the
increase has been nearly as spectacular: 10 000 graduates in
2000 and 81 000 in 2009. Full and part-time enrollment in both
public and private tertiary institutions doubled between 2000
and 2007 from 1 404 880 to 2 828 528 (Figure 6).

UNESCO SCIENCE REPORT 2010

In the past 20 years, Iran has deployed students and
researchers abroad, either to study or to present their
scientific achievements in international scientific
conferences. One example is collaboration between the
UK and Iran in higher education and research (British
Council et al., 2005). Today, numerous Iranian students are
pursuing their studies abroad in different disciplines. The
cost is borne mainly by the students themselves but the
government also offers study grants.

POLICY ENVIRONMENT FOR 
BUSINESS R&D
Progress in developing new technologies is hampered in
Iran by the cost of setting up a business, weak intellectual
property rights and government domination of large
enterprises. Over the past 15 years, the government has
set up high executive councils in nanotechnology,
biotechnology, fuel cell technology and information and

R&D OUTPUT
Trends in scientific publishing
The expansion of higher education in general (Figure 6)
and graduate studies in particular has in turn improved
Iran’s standing in international journals. The number of
Iranian articles published in the natural and social
sciences and engineering rose by 123% between 1995
and 2005, according to Thomson Reuters’ Science Citation
Index (SCI). In the seven months to July 2009, Iranian
scientists published 10 991 articles in international
journals. This compares with 10 361 in 2007 for the entire
twelve-month period and 13 569 in 2008, according to
MoSRT (Figure 7). Not surprisingly, the number of
researchers per million population has similarly risen from
500 in 2000 to 850 in 2007, according to MoSRT.

Figure 8 illustrates the contribution of different scientific
disciplines over the past sixteen years. Iran has been
consistently strong in engineering but clinical medicine
has replaced chemistry as the second most prolific field of
Iranian science in recent years.

Since 1999, Iran has overtaken Pakistan, Malaysia and
South Africa in scientific publishing. According to MoSRT,
scientific publishing has grown faster in Iran than
anywhere else in the world in recent years. International
collaboration as measured by scientific articles has also
increased markedly (Figure 9).

Today, the Iranian government is attempting to use another
international index known as the Islamic World Citation
Database (ISC). This database recorded more than 73 000
articles for Iranian scientists from 2000 to 2008. The Council
of the Cultural Revolution and the MoSRT have put
incentives in place to encourage scientists to submit papers
to the ISC, such as the promise of promotion to a higher
grade for university professors.

Box 1:  Biolarvicides and beauty products from biotechnology research  

The Persian Gulf Biotechnology
Research Centre was set up on the
island of Qeshm in southern Iran in
1997 by Nasrin Moazami, founder of
the Biotechnology Research Centre at
the Iranian Research Organization for
Science and Technology (IROST) in
Tehran in 1982. The plant develops
plant propagation using the tissue
culture of bananas, orchids and date
palms to increase agricultural
productivity. It also explores the
qualities of coral for health
applications. Coral is strikingly similar
to bone, with a 98% degree of
compatibility. This makes coral a
potential substitute for bone
transplants in patients, as there is no
risk of rejection by the human body.      

The sea offers endless possibilities

for product development using
biotechnology. Algae, for example,
can be used as a biofertilizer for

agriculture; it can be fermented to
produce methane and methanol for
use in cooking and to fuel cars. Algae
can also be marketed on the food,
health and beauty markets. 

The centre is also exploring the
potential of Aloe vera. This plant can
be marketed as a highly nutritious
supplement or even in the form of a
moisturizing cream. As it stimulates
the body’s immune system, it is also
effective in healing intestinal diseases.     

Qeshm island has also been the
theatre of trials to test a biolarvicide
known as Bacillus thuringiensis M-H-
14, which was also successfully tested
elsewhere in southern Iran and in
Sudan before being registered at the
European Patent Office in 2003. This
toxin hones in a on a receptor in the
gut that only the Anopheles mosquito
possesses, making the biolarvicide
innoccuous to all other living species,

including human beings. The
bacterium was isolated from dead
Anopheles stepehensis larvae, a major
vector of malaria in Iran. The
biolarvicide was developed by a
research team led by Nasrin Moazami
at the Biotechnology Research Centre
in Tehran. Since November 2004, it
has been manufactured under the
trademark of Bioflash by the Iranian
Nature Biotechnology Company,
founded in 1999.

The Biotechnology Research
Centre is a member of UNESCO’s
global network of microbial resource
centres in developed and developing
countries, which co-operate in
microbiological and biotechnological
research.

Box 2:  Developing high-tech industries via IDRO

Since its inception in 1967, Iran’s
Industrial Development and
Renovation Organization (IDRO) has
established and developed general
contractor companies in different
fields. Today, it promotes domestic
and foreign investment in minority
holdings it owns in new, high-tech
and export-oriented industries in
particular. These high-tech areas
include ICTs, advanced materials,
biotechnology and life sciences,
electronics, micro-electronics and
nanotechnology. 

(ARYA) and the Iran Industrial
Consultant Engineering Company (IIC).

IDRO supports high-tech

development from the earliest stages
of a project, when it is still no more
than an idea, through to the delivery
of products and services to the
market. IDRO develops an
entrepreneurship development plan
and innovation development plan for
affiliated companies wishing to set up
pilot plants to scale up research
projects. It also runs a Small Business
Development Centre.

According to Article 44 of Iran’s

As part of its mission for attracting

Constitution, all large-scale industries
are public property. IDRO controls
about 290 companies, making it one
of Iran’s largest holding companies.
Major companies owned by IDRO
include Industrial Projects
Management of Iran (IPMI), the Rail
Transportation Industries Company
(RTI), Pars International Development
and Engineering Company (PIDECO),
the Iranian Offshore Engineering and
Construction Company (IOEC),
Construction Projects Management of
Iran (MAPSA), the Langroud Gas
Production Company (GTL), the Arya
Oil and Gas Development company

local and foreign investors to high-
tech industries, IDRO prepares a
feasibility study and business plan,
and identifies potential investors and
technology providers in order to
establish partnerships and joint
ventures. IDRO also sets up small and
medium-sized enterprises with local
and foreign partners to execute
approved projects and commercialize
technology. Partners invest in
industrial plants set up through
technology transfer.  

IDRO has founded special-purpose
companies in each high-tech sector to
co-ordinate investment and business

development. These entities are the
Life Science Development Company
(LIDCO), Information Technology
Development Center (MAGFA), Iran
InfoTech Development Company
(IIDCO), Advanced Materials Industrial
Development Company (AMIDCO) and
the Emad Semiconductor Company.
In 2009, IDRO was planning to set
up a venture capital fund to finance the
innovation cycle. The fund will focus on
the intermediary stages of product and
technology-based business
development. One of IDRO’s subsidiaries,
the Entrepreneurship Development
Company of Iran, has done a lot of
preparatory work for this fund. 

By March 2010, it is expected 
that IDRO will have offered private
investors shares in 150 industrial
companies. IDRO has privatized 
140 of its companies in the past for 
a value of about 2000 billion rials
(about US$ 200 million). This strategy
follows an amendment to Article 44
of the Constitution in 2004 which set
in motion a ten-year plan to privatize 
80% of Iran’s state-owned assets

industries in high technologies in particular. It also
promotes a business climate for private enterprises. 

The centre’s first step has been to prepare a strategic plan
for electronic industries encompassing communication
technology, micro-electronics, the automation industry
and so on, as well as for new materials, biotechnologies,
information technologies, civil airspace, laser technology
and optics, and nanotechnologies. 

the private sector since the beginning of the Third
Development Plan to develop new industries (Box 2). 
As of 2002, five foreign investment projects had been set
up with a budget of US$ 300 million (MPO, 2003). 

With regard to infrastructure, the government had
planned to develop the country's technology parks,
incubators, visionary technology institutions, techno-
markets and clusters during the Third and Fourth
Development Plans.3 The success of this kind of policy

Box 3: The Iranian Fisheries Research Organization

One of the country’s major research
centres is the Iranian Fisheries Research
Organization (IFRO). 

IFRO performs applied research to
determine how best to protect aquatic
organisms and their environment. 
The aim is to replenish fish stocks and
exploit them sustainably in Iranian
waters. This goal is mentioned in
Article 3 of the constitution of the
Iranian Fisheries Company, adopted in
1985. It also figures in the second law

governing the protection and
exploitation of aquatic resources,
adopted by Parliament on 
5 September 1995. 

IFRO pursues scientific 

co-operation with the United Nations
Food and Agricultural Organization,
INFOFISH, the Southeast Asian Fisheries
Development Centre, FISHBASE, the
World Conservation Union’s NACA
network of aquacultural research
centres across 18 countries in the 

Asia–Pacific region, the Indian Ocean
Tuna Commission, World Fish Centre
(GOFAR), the Convention on
International Trade in Endangered
Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, 
and Gent University in Belgium. 
IFRO is also a member of the European
Aquaculture society, Marine
Technology Society, Asian Fisheries
Society, World Aquaculture Society and
World Sturgeon Conservation Society.

depends on macro-economic conditions, intellectual
property regimes, international co-operation and trade to
reduce the risks, particularly for small and medium-sized
enterprises and the broader private sector. To create
conditions that will be conducive to the development of
infrastructure, you need to improve supporting networks
and providers, and to develop R&D in the private sector.
Without these foundations, the private sector remains
weak, increasing the need for government intervention.
As the government itself is faced with budgetary
limitations, this creates a major problem. Moreover,
centralized public policy breeds supply-oriented – as
opposed to demand-driven – S&T policy, as stated earlier.

Both public and private enterprises are involved in
international co-operation in licensing and technology
transfer in various areas, such as ICTs and the oil industry.
Examples are the involvement of the Mouj enterprise in
point-to-point radio and digital switch technology in
collaboration with the Republic of Korea and the sale of
the Samand automobile license belonging to the Iranian
Khodro company. 

Iran is developing scientific co-operation with the
Organization of Islamic Countries (OIC). It also plays an
active role in the Indian Ocean Rim Association for
Regional Co-operation4 and in the Economic Cooperation

4. The association promotes linkages between businesses in member
states (see Annex I for a list of countries). Projects and programmes are run
under the umbrella of three separate working groups: the Working Group
on Trade and Investment; the Indian Ocean Rim Business Forum; and the
Indian Ocean Rim Academic Group.

Organization (ECO),5 for which it was the host country in
2004, 2005 and 2006. Iran is also spearheading an
agricultural biotechnology network to connect national
biotechnology institutes, researchers, scientists,
engineers, and policy-makers from ECO member countries
and promote the continual exchange of knowledge and
research results (see also Box 3).

PROGRESS TOWARDS AN 
INFORMATION SOCIETY

E-readiness refers to the state of play of a country’s ICT
infrastructure. In this index, Iran ranked 69th in 2007 and
65th a year earlier (Economist Intelligence Unit, 2007). 
This index has been developed by the Economist Group.
‘The ranking model evaluates the technological,
economic, political and social assets of 69 countries and
their cumulative impact on their respective information
economies.’ Iran’s ranking might improve if scientific and
educational criteria were factored into the model. The
index for high-tech acquisitions by developing countries
ranges from 0.51 to 0.74. On this scale, Iran is indexed at
0.26 among active acquisition countries like India, Brazil,
and Egypt (MPO, 2003). 

In terms of access to technology, Iran has made rapid
progress. About 32% of the population used Internet in
2007, for example, up from barely 1% seven years earlier
(Table 2).

PUBLIC ATTITUDES TOWARDS SCIENCE

Among residents of Tehran, as many as 85.8% of respondents
to A National Survey on Socio-cultural Attitudes in the 1990s
considered science and knowledge to be ‘a very important
social value’ (Mohseni, 1996). A further 13.7% considered
them to be ‘more or less important’ and just 0.6%, or 
15 respondents out of 2320, ‘not important at all’. These results
were mirrored in the rest of the country. In the respondents’
ranking of social values, science came after reputation, health
or honesty but before wealth, position and fame.

Another national survey in 2005 studied cultural changes
within Iranian society. It found that Iranians equated
success in life first with individual effort then with
education, followed by position then familial influence
and, lastly, wealth. In a similar survey in 1975, Iranians had
placed education ahead of individual effort, education
being still a scarce resource at the time (Goodarzi, 2008).
Thanks to improvements in education, equality has
progressed in Iran, making individual effort more
important than before (Figure 10). 

In sum, we can conclude that Iranian society greatly
values science and that this has been one of the main

360

factors behind the development of both public and
private higher education in Iran. In spite of economic
difficulties, people spend a large share of their budget on
private tertiary education. Privately owned Azad
University has even become one of the biggest
universities in the world thanks to its paying students. 

CONCLUSION 

We have seen in these pages that the particularity of an oil
economy is that it can invest in S&T regardless of the social
and scientific contexts. S&T policy should insist on the role
of the private sector in R&D. A move towards participatory
planning with the co-operation of the private sector could
offer a valid alternative to centralized, bureaucratic
planning in S&T policy. This would create an environment
conducive to substituting the current science pull for an
orientation towards technology push, thereby allowing
socio-economic factors to play a role in S&T policy.

INTRODUCTION

The impressive performance of India’s economy since
liberalization of the economy got under way in 1991 – and
especially since 2005 – has been much talked about. Along
with China, India has become one of the fastest-growing econ -
omies in the world, strong enough to withstand the brunt of
the global recession since 2008. If growth in GDP dipped from
9.4% in 2007 to 5.7% in 2009, it was expected to climb back to
8.8% in 2010 (IMF, 2010). A number of studies have identified
technological development as one of the drivers of India’s
strong economic growth. The country’s science system has
undergone perceptible changes over the past five years or so:

I Although India's R&D intensity increased only slightly

between 2003 and 2007, from 0.80% to 0.88% of GDP, the
share of the business enterprise sector in gross domestic
expenditure on research and development (GERD) leapt
from 18% to an estimated 28%. As the government share
of GERD remained stable at 0.61% of GDP over the same
period, the 10% rise in the GERD/GDP ratio can be
attributed to the dynamism of the private sector;

I The state continues to accord great importance to
public research and development (R&D) in certain
high-tech areas, such as space, information technology
(IT) and pharmaceuticals; moreover, public R&D itself
has become more commercial and market-driven;

I The state has come to recognize the need to improve

both the quantity and quality of scientific personnel by
inaugurating a host of new tertiary institutions
focusing on science and engineering education. This
issue is discussed further on page 366;

I There has been a tremendous increase in the number
of foreign R&D centres, which have grown from fewer
than 100 in 2003 to about 750 by the end of 2009.
Most of these R&D centres relate to information and
communication technologies (ICTs) and the
automotive and pharmaceutical industries;

I Indian companies have been investing abroad and

acquiring important technology-based companies in
medium-tech and high-tech sectors. Examples are Tata
Steel’s takeover of the British industrial giant Corus,
Bharat Forge’s takeover of forging companies in
Germany, the UK and the USA, and Suzlon’s takeover of
wind turbine companies in Germany.

These five factors are slowly but steadily remodelling the
science and technology (S&T) landscape in India. In the
pages that follow, we shall survey developments since
2005 to the extent that data availability allows.

THE RISE OF INNOVATION IN INDIA

In recent years, there has been much discussion in the
popular press about the rise of innovation in India. This has
most likely been precipitated by the following factors:

I India’s rank in the Global Innovation Index1 has
improved. According to EIU (2009), India’s rank in 
the Economist Group’s Global Innovation Index for 
82 countries progressed from 58th place in 2006 to 56th
in 2008, with a further progression predicted to 54th
place by 2013. India has emerged as the fifth-largest
economy in the world in purchasing power parity (PPP)
dollars (World Bank, 2008). However, in relative terms,
India’s economy is just half the size of China’s, which is
growing at a faster rate: 8.7% in 2009 after progressing
by 10% or more for six years in a row. India’s GDP
growth slipped back to 7% in 2007 and to less than 6%
in 2009, after climbing from 5% in 2002 to a steady 9%
in 2005–2007 (IMF, 2010).

I There are many instances of innovation in the services

sector, especially as concerns health care. Currently,
the services sector accounts for two-thirds of GDP in India
(see page 324). Both the services and manufacturing
sectors have been performing very well. For a very long
time, Indian policy-makers avoided using the explicit term
of ‘innovation’ in policy documents dealing with
technological activities. The word ‘innovation’ appears in a
policy document for the first time in 2008, in the draft
National Innovation Act. This development reflects a
broad sentiment in both policy and business circles that
the country is becoming more innovative – or at least
certain industries. In the manufacturing sector, the release
of Tata’s Nano brand in 2008 hailed the advent of ‘the
world’s cheapest car’, at US$ 2 2002. In the health sector,
the MAC 400 machine produced by General Electric’s

1.   This index measures innovation performance in 82 countries, based on
the number of patents awarded to inventors from different countries by
patent offices in the USA, European Union and Japan. It also takes into
account factors that help or hinder the ability to innovate, such as the
GERD/GDP ratio and technical skills of the country’s labour force. The index
was created by the Economist Group, publisher of The Economist magazine.

used in rural areas to diagnose heart disease.

I The knowledge-intensity of India’s overall output

has expanded. Currently, about 14% of India’s net
domestic product3 is composed of knowledge-
intensive production (Table 1), much of it from the
services sector. Also noteworthy is that growth in
knowledge-intensive production surpasses that of the
economy overall. Data show that the majority of new
companies belong to knowledge-intensive sectors and
that the number of knowledge-intensive enterprises
has mushroomed over the past seven years or so. This
trend is corroborated by the technology content of all
industrial proposals implemented since the first
economic reforms in 1991. Once again, with the
exception of the textile industry and a few others, the
majority of new proposals emanate from technology-
oriented industries in areas such as chemicals, energy,
electrical equipment and so on.

I Foreign direct investment (FDI) from India has 
grown from just US$ 2 million in 1993 to about 
US$ 19 billion in 2009. This includes some high-
profile technology-based acquisitions abroad by Indian
companies. However, information on the rate of
survival of these ventures is unavailable. The amount of
FDI flowing from India had always been insignificant
until the trickle became a torrent from about 2005
onwards. Most of these investments have gone to
technology-based ventures in the manufacturing
sector of developed economies. According to Nayyar

(2008), ‘Indian firms could not have become
international without the capacity and the ability to
compete in the world market. The attributes of Indian
firms, which created such capacities and abilities, are
embedded in the past and have emerged over a much
longer period of time’. According to The Economist
(2009), the pursuit of technology is a powerful motive
for foreign acquisitions. Before Tata Steel’s purchase of
Corus, Europe's second-largest steel producer with
annual revenues of around £12 billion, the Indian
steelmaker did not hold a single American patent. The
takeover brought it over 80 patents, as well as almost
1 000 research staff. Thus, the growing number of
foreign acquisitions of ‘active targets’, in technological
jargon, has given Indian companies considerable
access to the technological capacity of the acquired
firms without their having to build this up assiduously
from scratch. The same goes for mergers.

I India has become more competitive in high-tech

areas. Although manufactured exports are still
dominated by low-tech products, the share of high-tech
products has doubled in the past 20 years (Figure 1).
India has become the world’s largest exporter of IT
services since 2005 and exports of aerospace products

Source: United Nations Comtrade database, applying the UNIDO (2009) definition of high-tech exports

have been increasing at a rate of 74% per year, compared
to 15% for world exports of these products. India is
acknowledged to have considerable technological
capability in the design and manufacture of spacecraft
and is now an acknowledged global leader in remote
sensing (Box 1). According to Futron’s 2009 ranking of ten
entities in its Space Competitiveness Index4, India ranks
better than the Republic of Korea, Israel or Brazil.
However, in India, the bulk of innovation in this area
comes entirely from the government rather than from
industry. By evoking the security angle, the government
seems to have thwarted all attempts to create a sectoral
system of innovation in the aerospace industry. This has
prevented the country from emerging as a serious player
in the civilian aerospace sector, despite possessing all the
requisite ingredients. However, this situation is now set to
change. Aerospace exports from India have increased
manifold in recent years, even if these tend to be
confined to aircraft parts or components. With
approximately 300 small and medium-sized enterprises
active in this area5, India is slowly emerging as one of the
few developing countries to have a high-tech industry of
the calibre of its aerospace industry.

leading players in space: Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, India, Israel, Japan,
Korea (Rep.), Russia and the USA. The index assesses more than 50 individual
metrics across three underlying dimensions of competitiveness: government,
human capital and industry.

5.  The Society of Indian Aerospace Technologies and Industries had over
300 members in 2009. Formed in 1991 and based in Bangalore, it brings
together R&D, manufacturing and support services in aerospace. Members
are drawn from both public- and private-sector industries and institutions
dealing in one way or another with the aerospace industry.

A PROPITIOUS POLICY ENVIRONMENT

India has a long history of policies related to technology
development, although no distinction was made initially
between science and technology. The earliest attempt to
support technical change in industry was the adoption of a
Scientific Policy Resolution by Parliament in 1958. This
policy laid the groundwork for training S&T personnel on a
sufficient scale to satisfy the needs of the various economic
sectors. This move was followed by a Technology Policy
Statement in 1983, the main aim of which was to develop
endogenous technology and ensure efficient absorption
and adaptation of imported technology corresponding to
national priorities and available resources.

In January 2003, the Prime Minister formally announced a
new Science and Technology Policy, the main objective of
which was to raise India's overall research intensity from
0.80% of GDP in 2003 to 2.0% of GDP by the end of the
Tenth Five-Year Plan in 2007. Although this target has not
been reached – the GDP/GERD ratio stood at 0.88% in 2007
– this policy contained four refreshingly new features:

I for the first time, a clear recognition of the extremely

low density of scientists and engineers, even though a
populous country like India counts a large number;

I an explicit statement on the need to manage brain

drain;

I an emphasis on increasing the number of patents at

home and abroad;

365

India_[11a] [P3]:Layout 1  18/10/10  19:41  Page 366

UNESCO SCIENCE REPORT 2010

I an explicit mention of monitoring implementation of

the policy, for instance stating that, ‘effective,
expeditious, transparent and science-based monitoring
and reviewing mechanisms will be significantly
strengthened and, if not available, will be put in place. 
It will be ensured that the scientific community is
involved in, and responsible for, the smooth and speedy
implementation’. This said, statistical indicators for
measuring policy outcomes are still very rudimentary in
India and what is meant by ‘science-based monitoring’
remains unclear. Another difficulty relates to the fact
that the 11 strategies outlined in the policy document
are extremely general. Much work needs to be done to
give them a more concrete form. Only then will it be
possible to evaluate whether or not the 2003 policy is a
real improvement over its predecessor in 1983.

India’s Eleventh Five-year Plan (2007–2012) contains
provisions for a massive rise in the public outlay for S&T   
of 220% over the previous plan. It fixes eight primary
objectives which confirm the growing emphasis on
innovation:

I a national mechanism is to be set up to develop policies

and provide orientations for basic research;

I the pool of S&T personnel is to be enlarged and
infrastructure reinforced (see below for details);
in parallel, efforts are to be made to attract and retain
young people to careers in science;

I ten national flagship programmes are to be launched in
areas ranging from the rural water supply, sanitation and
health to telephony and education, with a direct bearing
on India’s technological competitiveness;

I globally competitive research facilities and centres of

excellence are to be established (see below);

I an innovative spirit is to be kindled among scientists to

encourage them to translate R&D leads into
technologies that can be scaled up;

I new models of public–private partnership are to be

developed in higher education, particularly as concerns
university research and research in high-tech areas;

I linkages with advanced countries are to be encouraged,
including via participation in international megascience
initiatives like the Large Hadron Collider at the
European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), the
International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor
project (ITER) [see page 158] or the rice genome
sequencing project. The latter is based at the Indian
Agricultural Research Institute and involves
collaboration with Brazil, Japan, the Republic of Korea
and the USA, among others.

A key element of the policy are the linkages the
government is seeking to establish between 
innovation and development. This is exemplified in 
the implementation of the national flagship programmes
for improving the quality of primary education through
schemes like Sarva Sikhya Abhayan6 and in the intention
to develop the private sector’s role in establishing
research-based universities. The plan also stresses the 
oft-repeated maxim of improving university–industry ties.

As we near the end of the period covered by the plan, 
to what extent has the policy lived up to its promise? 
One major outcome of the S&T chapter within the
Eleventh Five-Year Plan has been the initiation of a system-
wide consultation of stakeholders on a draft National
Innovation Act by the Department of Science and
Technology within the Ministry of Science and
Technology. The main objective of this Act is to facilitate
public or private initiatives and public–private
partnerships to build an innovation support system;
develop a national integrated science and technology
plan; and codify and consolidate the law of confidentiality
to protect confidential information, trade secrets and
innovation. The proposed Act focuses on increasing
investment in R&D and enacting data confidentiality
clauses to make India a preferred destination for research-
oriented companies in sectors like IT, pharmaceuticals and
engineering. However, the draft Act is yet to come before
Parliament and, as such, remains of purely academic value
for the moment.

Improving the quality and quantity of human resources in
science and engineering is another area of great
importance to the government. In higher education, the

I ways and means are to be identified of catalysing

industry–university collaboration;

6.   This scheme strives to give all children eight years of primary schooling
and bridge the gender gap in elementary education by 2010, via
community ownership of the school system.

India

government is seeking to raise the gross enrollment ratio
from 11% in 2007 to about 15% by 2012 and 21% by 2017.
To achieve the target of 21 million students by 2012,
compared to 14.8 million in 2007, enrollment in
universities and colleges will need to grow by an annual
rate of 8.9%. This does not seem unattainable, as tertiary
enrollment grew by 15% between 2006 and 2007.

One-quarter of the student body is now enrolled in S&T
fields, according to the UNESCO Institute for Statistics.

To this end, the government has opted to establish
30 new central universities which will be owned and
managed by the central government: 16 new universities
for those 16 states which did not have a central university

Box 1: A space odyssey

India has had a very dynamic space
programme since 1969 when the
Indian Space Research Organization
(ISRO) was founded with
headquarters in Bangalore and
facilities spread throughout the
country. The size and importance of
India’s space programme can be
gauged from the fact that it is second
only to the USA in terms of the public
budget committed to space research:
approximately 0.10% of GDP. Space
research alone accounts for about
12% of GERD in India. 

The history of the space

programme since 1969 falls into two
phases. During the first phase
(1970–1980), ISRO used experimental
satellite programmes like Aryabhatta,
Bhaskara, Rohini and Apple for
experimental learning. During the
second phase in the post-1980
period, ISRO introduced endogenous
satellite and launch vehicle design
programmes.

ISRO’s activities cover four areas

of space research: 

I Earth observations and remote

sensing; 

I satellite communications and

navigation; 

I space science and environment:
spacecrafts Chandarayan 1 and 2
were the first to confirm the
presence of water at the poles on
the Moon in September 2009;

I launch vehicles. 

Of these four areas, India excels in
remote sensing, where it is considered
a world leader, and in the design and
manufacture of satellites and launch
vehicles. 

One important innovation in the
area of remote sensing has been the
development and launch of the beta
version of its web-based three-
dimensional satellite imagery tool,
Bhuvan, in August 2009. Bhuvan will
offer imagery of Indian locations
superior to that provided by other
Virtual Globe software like Google
Earth and Wiki Mapia, with spatial
resolutions ranging from 10 m to
100 m. For the moment, Bhuvan is
available only for the observation of
Indian locations, although it is
capable of offering images of the
entire planet. It is claimed to possess
a number of characteristics which
give it an edge over its immediate
competitor, Google Earth. This said,
given the large number of technical
glitches from which the software
suffers, its actual diffusion rate has
been limited. Nevertheless, Bhuvan
brings a new arc to ISRO’s bow by
combining both astronautic and
software capabilities.

Between its inception in 1975 and

2009, India's satellite launch
programme sent 55 satellites into orbit,
about half of them for Earth
observation and the remainder for
communication. ISRO has also
developed the technological capability

to design and manufacture both Polar
Satellite Launch vehicles and
Geostationary Satellite Launch Vehicles
(GSLV), although it has a better record
for the former. Recently, it has managed
to design highly complex cryogenic
engines for its GSLV, although the
technology has yet to be perfected. 

Two aspects of India’s space

programme are worth noting. Firstly,
ISRO has institutionalized an excellent
procedure for learning from past
failures in technology development.
Secondly, it has managed to use this
high technology for the benefit of the
civilian, through the establishment of
Village Resource Centres. This concept
integrates the capabilities of
communications and Earth observation
satellites to provide information
emanating from space systems and
other IT tools, in order to address the
changing and critical needs of rural
communities. One example is the
EDUSAT programme, launched by the
GSLV in September 2004. EDUSAT is
India’s first satellite devoted exclusively
to educational services, providing one-
way television broadcasts, interactive
television and video and computer
conferencing, among other services.
Networks have been set up in at least
24 states and programmes reach more
than 35 000 classrooms, including
schools for the blind via a specialized
network.

UNESCO SCIENCE REPORT 2010

Box 2: The incredible feat of Indian pharma

The pharmaceutical industry is one of
India’s foremost science-based
industries, with wide-ranging
capabilities in the complex field of
drug manufacture and technology.
The country produces pharmaceutical
formulations – the process of
combining different chemical
substances to produce a drug – and
over 400 active chemicals for use in
drug manufacture, known as Active
Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs). 

Industry turnover has grown from

a modest US$ 300 million in 1980 to
about US$ 19 billion in 2008. India
now ranks third worldwide after the
USA and Japan in terms of the volume
of production, with a 10% share of the
world market. In terms of the value of
production, it ranks 14th for a 1.5%
global share. 

A kaleidoscope of foreign and

Indian firms of varying sizes occupy
the manufacturing landscape. In all,
there are about 5 000 firms engaged
in manufacturing pharmaceuticals in
India, which employ directly about
340 000 individuals.

Much of industrial growth is

fuelled by exports. Between 2003 and
2008, exports grew by an average
rate of 22%. India currently exports
drug intermediates, bulk drugs, APIs,
finished dosage formulations,
biopharmaceuticals and clinical services.
The top five destinations in 2008 were,
in descending order, the USA, Germany,
Russia, the United Kingdom and China.

The industry has four key

characteristics: 

I it is dominated by formulations; 
I it is very active in the global

market for generics, supplying
even developed countries; 

I it enables India to be self-
sufficient in most drugs, as
witnessed by a growing positive
trade balance;

I it is one of the most innovative

industries in India, in terms of
R&D and the number of patents
granted, both in India and
abroad.

This fourth characteristic may

very well be the most important for
India, accounting for one out of every
four abbreviated new drug
applications (generic product
approvals) in 2007 and 2008. The
Indian pharmaceutical industry also
accounts for approximately 25% of
the drug master files with the US
Food and Drug Administration
(USFDA). India has the highest
number of USFDA-approved plants of
any foreign country.

What explains the dynamic

growth of Indian pharmaceuticals in
the past few decades? According to
one hypothesis, the 1970 Indian
Patents Act allowed Indian
pharmaceutical companies to come
up with very cost-effective processes
for imitating known products, by not
recognizing product patents for
pharmaceutical products. Favourable
to intellectual property rights, this
policy thus afforded the industry a
long learning period through a
process of reverse-engineering
essentially. A second hypothesis is
that the pharmaceutical industry
benefited from the availability of
highly trained personnel with a solid
scientific background. In fact, for
many years, the Indian higher
education system was biased in
favour of science to the detriment of

engineering. As a science-based
industry, pharmaceuticals are
purported to have benefited from
this apparent bias. 

One spin-off of India’s innovative
capability in pharmaceuticals is that it
has become a popular destination for
clinical trials, contract manufacturing
and R&D outsourcing. These
capabilities hold great promise for the
Indian pharmaceutical industry, as an
estimated US$ 103 billion of generic
products are at risk of losing patents
by 2012. Furthermore, the global
market for contract manufacturing of
prescription drugs is estimated to
grow from US$ 26 billion to US$ 44
billion by 2015 or so. According to
experts, the country has ‘good’ to
‘high’ skills in preclinical trials and
Phase I clinical trials and ‘very high’
skills in Phase II and Phase III clinical
trials. 

A very recent trend observed in
India’s pharmaceutical industry is the
wave of cross-border mergers and
acquisitions in which Indian
companies have taken over foreign
ones and foreign firms have in turn
taken over Indian companies. The
pharmaceutical industry has become
one of India’s most globalized
industries. One of the most high-
profile takeovers concerns Ranbaxy,
India’s largest pharmaceutical
company and the country’s biggest
producer of generic drugs. In 2008,
the Japanese pharmaceutical giant
Daiichi Sankyo acquired a majority
stake (35%) in Ranbaxy, at a cost of up
to US$ 4.6 billion.

before and 14 world-class universities. The Ministry of
Human Resource Development plans to set up these
14 ‘innovation universities’ across the country from 2010
onwards to build ‘disciplinary foci’ and drive R&D. Each
‘innovation university’ is expected to focus on one area 
or problem of significance to India, such as urbanization,
environmental sustainability and public health. Two
private companies have announced plans to build 
world-class universities of their own, Reliance and Anil
Agarwal. The latter has even donated US$ 1 billion to get
the Vedanta University project off the drawing board.

In parallel, the government is in the process of doubling
the number of Indian Institutes of Technology to 16 and
establishing 10 new National Institutes of Technology,
three Indian Institutes of Science Education and Research,
and 20 Indian Institutes of Information Technology to
improve engineering education. These new universities
and institutes are at various stages of creation. In 2006,
the ministry founded the Indian Institute for Science
Education and Research and the National Institute of
Science Education and Research. The Indian Institute of
Space and Technology followed a year later.

In addition, in 2010, the government was in the process of
adopting a policy permitting foreign universities to enter
the higher education system in India by establishing their
own campuses or joint ventures with existing universities
and institutes.

All of these changes augur well for the further development
of science and engineering education in India.

The impact of the Indian Patent Act
One important policy change in recent years has been
the adoption of the Indian Patent Act, which took effect
on 1 January 2005. This ordinance sought to bring the
country into compliance with the Agreement on 
Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights
(TRIPS) of the World Trade Organization. The most
distinguishing feature of this policy change is the
recognition of both product and process patents, as
opposed to solely process patents in the earlier Act of
1970. In bringing India into compliance with TRIPS, the
intention was to restrict innovation in the pharmaceutical
industry in particular, where the lack of product patents
had allowed firms to reverse-engineer known products at
little cost. This 35-year learning period seems to have
given the pharmaceutical firms the time they needed to

I

i

India

acquire the skills that are crucial to inventing new
chemical entities (Box 2).

After the adoption of the Indian Patent Act, it was
expected that R&D spending by the pharmaceutical
industry would slump. This reasoning was based on the
belief that much of Indian R&D in pharmaceuticals
consisted of reverse-engineering. By requiring recognition
of both product and process patents, it was thought that
the amended act would effectively reduce the space for
this type of R&D. However, it turns out that private
pharmaceutical companies in India have actually been
registering an increase in R&D investment since 2000 of
almost 35% per year (Figure 2).

In fact, some of the provisions in the Indian Patent Act
have protected Indian pharma, even if the ordinance
imposes a 20-year protection period for product patents.

UNESCO SCIENCE REPORT 2010

For example, there is a provision for granting compulsory
licenses for the export of medicines to countries that have
insufficient or no marketing capacity, to meet emergent
public health situations, in accordance with the Doha
Declaration on TRIPS and Public Health. This allows Indian
companies to produce and export AIDS drugs to African
and Southeast Asian countries. Another safeguard has
been the introduction of a provision making patent rights
for mailbox applications available only from the date of
granting the patent rather than retrospectively from the
date of publication. This provision has saved many Indian
companies from being attacked for infringement of
patent law by multinational companies that might
otherwise have obtained patents for drugs already put on
the market by Indian companies (UNESCO, 2005).

As for the impact of the Indian Patent Act on innovation in
the agriculture, biotechnology and IT sectors this still
requires in-depth analysis.

R&D INPUT

Complex trends in R&D expenditure
Both the nominal and real growth rates of GERD have
declined in India since liberalization of the economy
began in 1991. The country’s overall research intensity
has remained virtually constant at about 0.78% (Table 2).
In China, on the other hand, the GERD/GDP ratio has
more than doubled to 1.54% (see page 389).

Care must be exercised in interpreting these figures to
mean that overall investment in R&D has declined, owing
to the peculiarities of Indian research. Even now, the
government accounts for over two-thirds of R&D
performed in the country, although this share has
declined over time. This trend has been accompanied by
an increase in R&D investment by business enterprises,
which now account for about 28% of GERD, compared to
just 14% in 1991. In China, business enterprises have
come to perform as much as 71%, with government
research institutes accounting for only 19%. The growing
share of R&D performed by the private sector is generally
considered to be a desirable trend, as enterprises tend to
transform the results of their research into products and
processes more rapidly than the government sector.
As concerns the breakdown of GERD by type of research,
the share devoted to basic research has increased quite
substantially since 2003 (Figure 3).

370

Government expenditure on R&D in India tends to focus
on nuclear energy, defence, space, health and agriculture
(Figure 4). In the Eleventh Five-Year Plan, the public-sector
outlay on S&T increased by a whopping 220% in nominal
terms compared to actual expenditure on S&T in the Tenth
Plan. The biggest beneficiary has been the Department of
Atomic Energy, the budget of which nearly tripled from 
Rs 3 501 to Rs 11 000 Crores. Part of this amount will go
towards funding India’s participation in the ITER project,
which India joined in 2005. The Council of Scientific and
Industrial Research has also enjoyed a massive increase
(from Rs 2 575 to Rs 9 000 Crores), as has the Department
of Biotechnology (from Rs 1 450 to Rs 6 389 Crores). The
rise in the public-sector plan outlay for renewable energy
may have been less dramatic (from Rs 7 167 to Rs 10 460
Crores) but nevertheless represents a growth rate of
about 46%.

The spillover of government research to civilian use is 
very limited in the Indian context, although conscious
efforts have been made by the government recently to
orient research more towards socio-economic goals. This
is slowly beginning to produce results, especially in the
area of space research with the development of
environmental monitoring, satellite communications 
and so on.

One interesting result highlighted by the above analysis
is that the higher education sector constitutes only a
fraction of R&D performed in India, despite the fact that
this sector encompasses the prestigious Indian Institute
of Science dating back to 1909, the eight Indian
Institutes of Technology and over 300 universities. In
other words, the higher education sector in India is not a
source of technology for industry. This may come as a
surprise, as the Indian Institutes of Technology do
collaborate with private industry. Unfortunately,
however, cases of actual technology generation are few
and far between, as much of R&D relates to basic
research. Moreover, the institutes tend to be extremely
teaching-intensive institutions. It is estimated that the
entire higher education sector in India contributes no
more than 5% of GERD. It does act as an important
reservoir of skilled personnel, however, for the other
actors in India’s national innovation system.

Thus, the only sector performing more R&D than before is
industry and the private sector in particular. Currently,
private companies spend approximately four times more

than public enterprises on R&D and nearly three times
more when compared to government research institutes.
In other words, private enterprises in India are moving
towards the core of India’s innovation system.

The veracity of this trend is sometimes questioned on
the grounds that business enterprises reporting R&D
expenditure to the Department of Science and
Technology may be tempted to exaggerate their R&D
expenditure to gain tax incentives available in India to
any business enterprise investing in R&D. These tax
incentives are linked to the volume of R&D performed –
hence the temptation to overstate it. However, this
suspicion would appear to be unfounded if one
compares R&D investment as reported by the
Department of Science and Technology with the 
dataset available from the Centre for Monitoring the
Indian Economy’s Prowess for the period 1991–2003. 
This comparison shows that, although the level 
reported by the Department of Science and Technology
is higher over most of the years under consideration
than in the early 1990s, the difference has tended to
decrease over time. Moreover, both series have followed
a similar curve. The argument that the increase in R&D
expenditure by private companies is a mere statistical
artifice would thus appear to be false.

Four industries account for the lion’s share of 
investment in R&D, with the pharmaceutical and
automotive industries topping the list (Figure 5). In fact,
it is sometimes claimed that India’s national system of
innovation is led by the pharmaceutical industry. It can
therefore be safely concluded that, although GERD may
not have risen, the pharmaceutical industry has been at
the helm of an impressive rise in R&D expenditure by the
private sector. Based on this one indicator, the more
correct statement would be that there is insufficient
evidence to show that the entire industrial sector in 
India has become more innovative since 1991 but
sufficient evidence to posit that India’s pharmaceutical
industry has become more innovative. We shall confront
this statement later with trends in the number of patent
applications and grants in India (see page 375).

The recent growth of knowledge-intensive industries
is prompting many commentators to profess that
India is becoming a knowledge economy. India’s
‘copious supply’ of technically trained personnel is
considered one of the key drivers of this growth.
However, of late, industry has been complaining of
serious shortages in technically trained personnel.
For instance, a study by the Federation of Indian
Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI, 2007)
has revealed that rapid industrial expansion in a
globally integrated Indian economy has stimulated a
huge demand for skilled personnel. However, the lack
of quality higher education has become a hindrance
to satisfying this demand. Based on a study
conducted in 25 industrial sectors, the survey also
revealed that there is currentlya 25% shortage of
skilled personnel in the engineering sector. Figure 6
compares the present supply and density of scientists
and engineers in India with the situation in China.

Two issues have an impact on the potential supply of
scientists and engineers for domestic businesses in
particular. The first is the long-standing issue of the
migration of highly skilled personnel from India to
the West primarily, with every indication that this
brain drain has increased recently (Mani, 2009).
According to some estimates, the emigration by
highly skilled Indians as a share of those in tertiary
education has increased from 2.6% in the 1990s to
about 4.2% in the early 2000s. The second issue
concerns the growing amount of FDI flowing into
R&D. Foreign R&D centres are able to offer domestic
researchers and R&D personnel better incentives,
both pecuniary and otherwise, than domestic
businesses. As a result, India’s small stock of scientists
and engineers may be lured to the foreign R&D
centres, causing a ‘crowding out’ of sorts to take
place. Lan and Liang (2006) have already observed
this phenomenon in China. In addition to the supply
question, doubts have been expressed as to the
quality of education in science and engineering in
India, although quality is often a difficult parameter
to measure objectively.

Scientists and engineers in short supply
It is generally held that India has a copious supply of
scientists and engineers, yet the actual density of
personnel engaged in R&D and innovation is fairly
modest, at just 137 per million population (see page 328).

The central government in particular has reacted by
putting in place a number of measures which
combine quantity and quality, not only in higher
education but also in technical education. For details
of these ambitious schemes, see page 366.

A sharp rise in scientific publications
According to Thomson Reuters data, India’s publication
record shows a steep rise, especially since 2003 (Table 3 and 
Figure 7). If this growth rate is maintained, India’s publication
record will be on par with most G8 nations within 7–8 years.
India could even overtake them between 2015 and 2020.

India’s publications are evenly distributed between the
physical and life sciences. The most recent data confirm
earlier findings that India’s strength truly lies in the basic
sciences such as chemistry, physics, pharmacology and
toxicology (Figure 8).

economies like Brazil. However, the period since 2004 has
seen greater collaboration with Asian countries, notably
Japan and the Republic of Korea. One important finding is
the relatively sparse collaboration with European partners
and especially the UK. This shortcoming is now being
explicitly addressed by the European Union (EU) and British
government through a host of new partnerships. The UK–
India research partnership and recent initiatives under the
EU’s Seventh Framework Programme for Research and
Technological Development (2007–2013) are two
illustrations of research partnerships between India and the
developed world in a host of S&T areas ranging from health
to space and nanotechnology.

Foreign companies dominate patents
India has improved its patenting record in the USA, 
with an acceleration over the past decade. Most Indian
patents are utility patents, defined as being those for new
inventions (Figure 9). However, most of these patents are in
chemistry-related areas and the great majority are being
granted to foreign companies located in India, based on
R&D projects they have carried out in India, in a growing
trend (Mani, 2010a). 

Similarly, the number of national patents granted by the
India Patent Office has increased tremendously but over
three-quarters are still being granted to foreign entities.
Once again, most of these patents concern chemistry and
pharmaceutical-related areas. Thus, although the TRIPS
compliance of the Indian Patents Act appears to have had a
positive effect on patenting by Indian inventors, most of the

CONCLUSION

We have seen that economic growth has taken off in India,
especially in the past five years. This performance has
been very lopsided, however, tending to favour certain
regions and income groups over others. In order to make
economic growth more inclusive, the government has
been placing greater emphasis on S&T, as witnessed by
the massive increase in the budget allocation to S&T
during the Eleventh Five-year Plan (2007–2012). It is also
making an effort to orient innovation in the government
sector more towards socio-economic goals.

The country has certainly made great strides in 
space research, life sciences and especially in
biopharmaceuticals and information technology.
Although domestic science continues to dominate, there
is also a growing presence of foreign entities in India’s
technology system. The main challenge facing the country
will be to improve both the quality and quantity of S&T

personnel. Fortunately, policy-makers are seized of this
problem and have taken energetic steps to remedy the
situation. The future success of India’s STI system will
depend on how well they succeed.

INTRODUCTION

China has made great strides in system reform and
economic development over the past decade. The
world’s fastest-growing large economy, it will overtake
Japan by the end of 2010 to become the world’s
second-biggest economy in terms of GDP1. 

The country has emerged more or less unscathed from
the global economic recession triggered by the sub-
prime crisis in the USA in 2008. After an initial slump in
employment caused by falling demand for exports to
Europe and the USA, China’s economy bounced back in
2009, growing by 8.7% (IMF, 2010). The key driver of this
growth is government-led investment. For example, the
government has implemented a plan for injecting an
additional 4 trillion Yuan (circa US$ 590 billion) into the
economy over a two-year period. According to this plan,
the central government is investing 1.18 trillion Yuan to
leverage local governments and private firms to spend
more than 2.82 trillion Yuan. Another government plan
aims to restructure and invigorate ten key industries:
automobile, iron and steel, textiles, equipment
manufacturing, shipbuilding, petrochemicals, light
industry, electronic information, non-ferrous metal and
logistics. The central government’s investment rose from
420.5 billion Yuan in the previous year’s budget to 
924.3 billion Yuan (circa US$ 62.8 billion) in 2009. Of this,
16% was earmarked for innovation, restructuring,
energy-saving, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and
environmental protection. This not only effectively
compensated for the shortfall created by shrinking
external demand but also strengthened weak links and
laid a solid foundation for long-term socio-economic
development (Wen Jiabao, 2010). 

The government has given environmental protection
high priority in the Tenth (2001–2005) and Eleventh
Five-Year Plans (2006–2010). It has imposed the
mandatory objective of reducing energy consumption
per unit of GDP by 20% and emissions of major
pollutants by 10% by the end of the Eleventh Five-Year
Plan in 2010, in order to reverse the trend of ecological

and environmental deterioration over the past two
decades. In April 2010, Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao
announced plans to adopt a binding target for cutting
carbon dioxide emissions (Box 1). Local government
leaders and entrepreneurs are expected to assume a
greater role than before in achieving these targets and
will be evaluated for their performance in saving
energy and reaching emission-reduction targets.

Over the past decade, China has not only multiplied gross
domestic expenditure on R&D (GERD) by a factor of six
but also improved its capacity for generating intellectual
property rights (IPRs) via scientific papers and patents.
Today, only the USA publishes more scientific articles (see
page 10). The Eleventh Five-Year Plan for capacity-building
in innovation foresees the rapid development of
infrastructure to implement the knowledge innovation
programme and the programme for science and
technology (S&T) platforms: 12 megafacilities are to be
established by 2010, as well as about 30 national science
centres and national laboratories2  and 300 national key
laboratories. 

In 2005, the government issued the Outline of the
Medium- and Long-Term Plan for National Science and
Technology Development (2006–2020), which proposed
that China become an innovation-driven country by
2020 (State Council, 2006). The government then issued
a series of supportive policies to encourage
endogenous innovation, as well as 76 detailed policy
documents for implementing these supportive policies
by the end of 2008. This series of policies has had a
great impact on innovation in China and especially on
the innovative capacity of enterprises. It shall thus be
discussed in detail in the following section. 

China’s goal of becoming an innovation-driven country
by 2020 is a highly ambitious one. Today, the R&D
intensity of high-tech industry remains much lower in
China than in developed countries. China faces
daunting challenges in narrowing this innovation gap,
not least of which will be to find the right balance
between economic development and capacity-building
in science, technology and innovation (STI).

1. China ranks third in terms of annual output measured in US dollars but,
in terms of purchasing power parity (PPP), it has been the world’s second-
largest economy for years.

2. National laboratories are designed to conduct complex research and
innovation, whereas national key laboratories usually focus on research in
a specific discipline. Some national laboratories consist of several national
key laboratories.

Box 1: Accelerating development and use of renewable energies

At the first meeting of the National
Energy Commission in Beijing on 
22 April 2010, Chinese Premier Wen
Jiabao called for greater efforts to
enhance the country’s innovative
capacity in energy technology to cope
with rising domestic fuel demand and
severe energy shortages. ‘We must
accelerate the development and use
of renewable energies to ensure the
country’s energy security and better
cope with climate change,’ he said. 

Wen went on to say that China
ought to take measures to ensure
that non-fossil fuels accounted for
15% of China’s energy consumption
by 2020. He also stated that the
country would make it a binding
target to cut carbon dioxide
emissions per unit of GDP by 40–45%
by 2020 from 2005 levels. ‘The target
will be incorporated into the
country’s long-term economic and
social development plan,’ he said.

The government set up the
National Energy Commission in
January 2010 to improve co-ordination
of energy policy .The commission is
responsible for drafting the national
energy development plan, for
reviewing energy security and major
energy issues and for co-ordinating
domestic energy development and
international co-operation.

A PLAN FOR MAKING CHINA
INNOVATION-DRIVEN BY 2020
Priority areas for R&D to 2020
Experts have played an important role in the elaboration of
the Outline of the Medium- and Long-Term Plan for National
Science and Technology Development (2006–2020), the
eighth in China’s history. Once the 20 strategic issues had
been selected in 2003 by the State Council and an expert
consultation group composed of 20 scientists, more than 
2 000 experts were invited to conduct studies on these
topics. A broader consultation was also undertaken via 
e-mail, workshops and other means to enable people from
all walks of life to contribute ideas. The Outline groups all
technologies into five high-priority clusters:

be capable of absorbing the main bottlenecks of socio-
economic development. Fourthly, each should protect and
enhance national security. Last but not least, each should
be affordable for the Chinese government. In 2008, the
government invested 3.6 billion Yuan in 8 of the 
16 special megaprojects for civil S&T, corresponding to
about 167 smaller projects. Thirteen of the 16 mega
projects are listed in the Outline:

I core electronic devices, high-end generic chips and

basic software;

I extra large-scale integrated circuit manufacturing

technology and associated technology;

I next-generation broadband wireless mobile

communication;

I advanced computerized numerical control machinery

I technologies in the fields of energy, water resources 

and basic manufacturing technology;

and environmental protection; 

I large-scale oil and gas fields and coal-bed methane

I information technology (IT), advanced materials and

development;

manufacturing;

I biotechnologies and their applications in the fields of

agriculture, industry and human health; 

I space and marine technology; 
I basic sciences and frontier technology.

I advanced large-scale pressurized water reactors and

nuclear power plants with high-temperature, gas-
cooled reactors;

I water pollution control and governance;
I cultivation of new varieties of genetically modified

organisms;

The Outline launches 16 megaprojects in S&T. These
projects have been selected according to five basic
principles. Firstly, each project should correspond to
socio-economic needs, in order to cultivate strategic
industries. Secondly, each project should focus on key
common technologies that will have a profound impact
on industrial competitiveness. Thirdly, each project should

I development of major new drugs;
I prevention and treatment of AIDS, viral hepatitis and

other major infectious diseases;

I large aircraft;
I high-resolution Earth observation systems;
I human space flight and the Moon exploration

programme.

China

In recent years, there have been a number of breakthroughs
in priority areas for R&D. In 2003, China became the third
country after Russia and the USA to send astronauts into
space, for example, and there are plans to land a rover on the
Moon by 2012. In information technology, a team at the
University of Science and Technology of China built the
world’s first photonic telephone network in April 2009 (Box 2),
six months before China’s fastest supercomputer was released
in Changsha (Box 3). Also of note is the completion of the
Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility in April 2009, the
biggest scientific platform in China so far (Box 4).

Policies for building an innovation-driven nation 
Since the adoption of the Outline of the Medium- and Long-
Term Plan for National Science and Technology Development,
the government has issued a series of innovation policies
with a view to establishing an enterprise-centred national
innovation system and making China an innovation-driven
nation by 2020. Capacity-building for innovation has
become the core of the country’s national strategies,
marking an important shift in policy. This shift in focus is
reflected in the eight primary thrusts of the innovation
policies described overleaf.

Box 2: The world’s first photonic telephone network 

Quantum communication possesses
the feature of absolute security which
traditional means of communication
lack. However, due to the imperfect
nature of real systems and the lack of
true quantum single-photon sources,
the secure communication rate of
quantum communication systems
declines sharply with increasing
distance. This meant that, for a long
time, quantum communication was
stuck at the laboratory stage. 
In April 2009, Professor Pan

Jianwei and his research group from
the University of Science and

Technology of China built the world's
first photonic telephone network in
Hefei. This shows that absolutely
secure quantum communication can
be applicable to daily life. The group
successfully developed a quantum
phone prototype and constructed a
photonic telephone network which
can be freely expanded based on the
commercial fibre network. 

This research has taken the lead

worldwide in the field of practical
quantum communication. As Science
put it, ‘With such a presentation,
“quantum privacy” will not be a very

distant future in your own home’. 
As long ago as 2008, the group
established quantum entanglement
between two ensembles of cold
atoms connected by 300 m fibres,
perfectly realizing ‘quantum
repeaters’, which is vital to long-
distance quantum communication.
This significant outcome was
published in the issue of Nature dated
28 August 2009. It was listed as one of
China’s top ten achievements in S&T
for 2008.

Box 3: China’s supercomputers

China’s fastest supercomputer,
Tianhe-1 (TH-1), was released in
Changsha on 29 October 2009. With a
theoretical peak performance of
1.206 PetaFlop per second, TH-1
makes China only the second country
after the USA to develop a
supercomputer on such a scale. In
2009, TH-1 ranked fifth worldwide on
the Top500 organization’s list of
supercomputers. By 2010, it had
climbed to second place, according

to a Nebulae report, with a Linpack
performance of 1.271 PFlop per
second. TH-1 was voted one of
China's top ten achievements in S&T
for 2009 by 563 academicians of the
Chinese Academy of Sciences and
Chinese Academy of Engineering. 

Funded by the National

Programme for High-tech R&D (the
863 programme), the TH-1 project
was launched in 2008. TH-1
represents a hybrid design with Intel

Xeon processors and GPUs from
Advanced Micro Devices Inc. It has
wide applications in the fields of
resource exploration, biological
medicine development, aircraft and
space craft development, financial
engineering and new materials
development.

Box 4: The Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility

The Shanghai Synchrotron
Radiation Facility (SSRF) was
competed in April 2009 after 
52 months of construction. It is the
biggest scientific platform in China 
so far and represents an investment
of about 1.43 billion Yuan by the
central government. 

With electron beam energy of
3.5GeV, it is one of the best third-
generation light sources in the world.
SSRF consists of a 150MeV linear
particle accelerator, a booster that
can increase the electron energy from
150MeV to 3.5GeV in 0.5 seconds, as
well as a 3.5GeV electron storage ring. 

SSRF has the capacity to serve

hundreds of scientists and engineers
in various disciplines from
universities, institutes and industry
every day.

First thrust: a boost for investment in R&D 
I The government has established a diversified

investment system for S&T development to ensure that
government investment in S&T maintains a faster
growth rate than that of regular government revenue,
in order to guarantee the implementation of national
megaprojects in science and engineering and national
S&T programmes.

I The government has optimized the structure of

government expenditure on R&D by focusing on basic
research, public goods research and frontier
technology research and by providing the requisite
preferential policies to solve major challenges for
national, regional and industrial development.
Expenditure on basic research nearly doubled between
2004 and 2008, from 11.72 to 22.08 billion Yuan.
Despite this effort, the share of GERD devoted to basic
research actually dropped from 5.96% to 4.78% over
the same period (see page 389).

I The government has devised a new mechanism for

managing government expenditure on R&D, in order
to improve efficiency and effectiveness, with a focus on
expenditure on scientific research, the development of
talent and national S&T programmes. It has also
established a performance evaluation system to assess
government expenditure on R&D. 

Second thrust: tax incentives for investment in STI
I The government has formulated additional

preferential policies to enable enterprises to upgrade
their experimental facilities and instruments, by
speeding up the depreciation of imported facilities
and instruments for R&D. For example, the
government shares 12.5% of enterprise expenditure
on R&D by means of tax deductions. 

I Government policy provides tax incentives for the

technology development centre of enterprises3 ,
national engineering research centres4 , national
megaprojects for S&T and national R&D projects
involving sophisticated technological equipment, to
build innovation capacity in enterprises. Enterprises
are entitled to deduct the tariff and related value-
added tax from imported goods that are to be used in
R&D and when undertaking projects within national
S&T programmes. 

I The policies devised by the Ministry of Finance and the
State Administration of Taxation in 2006–2007 promise
to waive the income tax of transformed research
institutes5  to strengthen their capacity for innovation
(Box 5). In order to promote the development of small
and medium-sized enterprises, tax incentives extend to
venture capital and service organizations active in S&T,
such as science parks on university campuses and
incubators of technology-based enterprises. The policy
also encourages social organizations to support
innovation via tax-deductible donations. 

Third thrust: a government procurement policy to
promote innovation 
I The government has established a system for

purchasing the product of endogenous innovation
using government funds. This scheme includes setting

3. Creation of a technology development centre within an enterprise is
authorized by the National Development and Reform Committee and
three other government agencies. 

4 . The term national enterprise research centre also refers to a national
engineering technology research centre. 

5. Transformed research institutes have been transformed from state-
owned research institutes into enterprises (see Box 5).

up a system for authorizing endogenous innovation
and giving high priority to the product of endogenous
innovation in major national construction projects and
other relevant projects. 

I The government has taken administrative steps to
purchase initially and order products arising from
endogenous innovation, in order to encourage
enterprises to invest more in innovative product
development and capacity-building. 

I The government is establishing a scheme that will give
high priority to foreign companies prepared to transfer
technology to China6 ; this scheme will comprise a
system for authorizing domestic goods and an auditing
system for the purchase of foreign goods.

Fourth thrust: innovation based on assimilating imported
advanced technology
I Henceforth, key national projects are required to draw

up a plan for building innovation capacity based on
the assimilation of imported advanced technology.

I The government has modified the list of technologies

for which importation is either encouraged or
restricted. Enterprises and other bodies are
encouraged to import advanced technology for the
purposes of design and manufacture. 

I The government is giving high priority to key national
projects leading to the manufacture of a first batch of
equipment in China based on the assimilation of
imported advanced technology. 

I The government is supporting co-operation among

I The government supports technology standard-setting

and is encouraging enterprises to set endogenous
technology standards jointly with universities and
research institutes, and to integrate these standards in
R&D, design and manufacture. 

I The government has created an environment conducive
to IPR protection by making laws and regulations more
effective and by rewarding inventors and major
contributors to the commercialization of IPRs held by
public organizations. 

I The government has shortened the examination cycle

for invention patents.

Sixth thrust: building national infrastructure and platforms 
for STI
I The government has constructed infrastructure and
platforms for R&D, including scientific facilities, large
equipment and scientific databases. These have been
established for use by national laboratories, national
engineering laboratories and national engineering
research centres. 

I By fostering co-operation between enterprises,

universities and research institutes, the government is
supporting enterprises in their efforts to establish a
technology development centre and national
engineering laboratories in their midst in key R&D
fields. The greatest beneficiaries of this scheme so far
have been the transformed research institutes and
large enterprises. National engineering laboratories
tend to focus on developing pre-competitive
technology and frontier technology. 

industries, universities and research institutes in
assimilating imported advance technologies and
innovation. It is also giving high priority to the technology
platform in the national programme for S&T infrastructure. 

I The government has established a mechanism for

sharing platforms for S&T and innovation among users
and for evaluating the openness and effectiveness of
these platforms. 

Fifth thrust: capacity-building in generating and 
protecting IPRs
I In 2007, the Ministry of Science and Technology
compiled a list of key technologies and products 
for which China should hold related patents and 
which the country should develop within national 
S&T programmes (MOST, 2007a). The ministry also
established a platform for an IPR information service 
to support enterprises in applying for patents.

Seventh thrust: cultivate and utilize talents for STI
I In order to cultivate home-grown talents that are

world-class and give them an international
perspective, China has recruited more than 800 top
foreign scientists and other experts working in China

6.One example is the opening of the Airbus (Beijing) Engineering Centre in
early 2006, within a joint venture between Airbus and China's two largest
aviation companies, the China Aviation Industry Corporation I and II.

UNESCO SCIENCE REPORT 2010

Box 5: Milestones on the road to a national innovation system

In 1978, China initiated the first of a
series of far-reaching reforms and
began opening up to the outside
world. The first reform as far as the
science system was concerned
consisted in extending the decision-
making power of R&D institutes and
reforming the R&D funding system.
This was followed by the gradual
introduction of a market mechanism
into the S&T system and by S&T-related
legislation. The last stage has seen the
establishment of a national innovation
system favouring S&T-based socio-
economic development. The reform of
the science system can be divided into
four historic stages.

Reconstructing the scientific
management system (1978–1985)
The National Science Conference in
March 1978 marked a turning point in
China. The conference emphasized
that ‘S&T is the productive force’ and
that ‘the modernization of S&T is the
key of the four modernizations’, the
other three being industry, agriculture
and defence. The 1978 conference laid
vital ideological and theoretical
foundations for the rediscovery of the
position, function and influence of S&T
in promoting economic development.
The conference approved the Outline
of the National Science and Technology
Development Plan (1978–1985) and
issued three complementary
documents: Main Tasks of Scientific and
Technological Research, a National Plan
for Basic Science and a National Plan for
Technological Sciences. Two critical
measures were adopted in this period:
the national examination system for
higher education was restored in 1978
to develop qualified S&T personnel
and the National Leading Group for

Science and Technology of the State
Council was established in December
1981 to strengthen scientific
management. 

Reforming the science system
(1985–1992)
In March 1985, the Central
Committee of the Communist Party
of China (CCCPC) proposed a
strategic guideline that ‘economic
development must rely on S&T, while
the development of S&T must be
oriented towards serving economic
development’ (CCCPC, 1985). This
guideline served as a roadmap for the
reform of the science system. It had
five main thrusts, namely to: 

I reform the funding system for S&T

and manage funding;

I implement a technology contract

system, so as to develop the
market for technology and
promote the commercialization of
research results;

I introduce a market mechanism

and adjust the organizational
structure of S&T, in order to
strengthen enterprises’ capacity
for technology development;

I empower research institutes by

giving them the right to self-
determination and independent
status;

I reform the system of S&T personnel

management and implement a
merit-based pay system. 

Technology Contract Law (1987) and
Copyright Law (1990). 

It also improved the national S&T
awards system by adjusting existing
awards and setting up new ones,
including the: National Natural Science
Award, National Invention Award and
National Science and Technology
Progress Award. In parallel, China
adopted a series of important policy
measures to adapt institutions and
policies to the needs of socio-economic
development, including: establishing
the National Natural Science
Foundation of China; initiating the
National High-Tech R&D Programme,
also known as the 863 programme
because it was proposed by four top
Chinese scientists in March 1986;
creating high-tech industrial
development zones and; encouraging
the development of technology-based
enterprises.

Making S&T an integral part of the
economy (1992–1998)
In 1992, China proposed establishing a
socialist market economy. In order to
make S&T an integral part of the
economy, the government proposed
adjusting the allocation pattern for
resources destined for S&T. A key policy
measure was the instigation of the
Combination Development Project for
Industries, Universities and Research
Institutes in April 1992 by the State
Economic and Trade Commission, 
in tandem with the State Education
Commission and Chinese Academy of
Sciences.

The Science and Technology

Between 1982 and 1990, 

China promulgated several laws and
regulations that included the Trademark
Law (1982), Patent Law (1984),

Progress Law, promulgated in July l993,
resolved some fundamental legal issues.
For instance, it defined the objective
and key tasks of S&T activities and

related policies. To make sure R&D was
not ignored in the process of
integrating S&T in the economy, the
CCCPC and State Council issued the
Decision on Accelerating the Progress of
Science and Technology (1995), which
emphasized, as in 1985, that ‘economic
construction must rely on S&T, while the
development of S&T must be oriented
towards serving economic develop-
ment’ but, significantly, added to this the
mention ‘towards scaling the heights of
world S&T’. 

In order to promote the economic

integration of S&T, China formulated
the Law on Promoting the
Transformation of Scientific and
Technological Achievements in May
1996. This law provides legal protection
for the commercialization of research
results. Thereafter, the government
advocated orienting scientific research
institutes towards economic
development by having them: join an
enterprise as a technology
development arm for the enterprise or
an industrial sector; function according
to the operational mechanism of
corporations; set up enterprises or
become an enterprise themselves;
become a technological service
organization (State Council, 1996). 
In order to ‘scale the heights of

world S&T’, the government initiated the
National Key Basic R&D Programme. This
is also known as the 973 programme
because it was approved by the State
Leading Group for Science and
Education11 of the State Council in
March 1997.

Building a national innovation
system (1998–2005)
In June 1998, the State Leading Group
for Science and Education decided to
initiate the Knowledge Innovation

Programme (KIP) by supporting the
pilot project of the Chinese Academy of
Sciences, in order to create a national
innovation system and knowledge
economy. The goal of KIP was to build
the Chinese Academy of Sciences into a
leading academic institution and
comprehensive R&D centre in the
natural and engineering sciences and in
high-tech innovation, turn it into a
scientific research base of international
standing, an incubator of talented S&T
personnel and a springboard for the
development of China's high-tech
industries.

In order to strengthen linkages

between the different actors of S&T and
develop an enterprise-centred
technological innovation system, the
government decided to transform 242
state-owned research institutes into
state-owned enterprises in February
2009. This process can only two take
forms: either the institute joins an
existing enterprise or it becomes a
state-owned enterprise itself.

These 242 research institutes were

affiliated to 10 former ministries that
included the Ministry of Machine
Building, the Ministry of the Metallurgy
Industry and the Ministry of Coal. By the
end of 1999, all had been transformed
into state-owned enterprises: 131 had
joined large enterprises, 40 had become
enterprises, 18 had become techno-
logical service organizations and 29 had
been transformed into 12 large self-
supporting, technology-based

enterprises owned by the central
government. In order to support 
the industrialization of these 
242 institutions, the central government
adopted preferential policies
concerning taxation, loans, subsidies
and personnel. 

In June 1999, the government

established the Innovation Fund for
Technology-based Small Enterprises. 
It also implemented a Strategy for
Rejuvenating Trade by Means of
Science and Technology, with a view 
to promoting quality high-tech
exports. The Decision issued by
CCCPC and State Council in August
1999 on Strengthening Technological
Innovation to Develop and Industrialize
High-tech gave an additional boost to
the commercialization of research
results. In June 2000, the government
adopted preferential policies
concerning investment, financing,
taxation, talented personnel and the
intellectual property protection to
promote the development of
software and integrated circuit
industry (State Council, 2000).

In June 2002, China promulgated

the Outline of the National Talents
Construction Plan (2002–2005) and
proposed a Strategy for
Reinvigorating China with its Talented
Human Resources. In December
2003, the CCCPC and the State
Council issued a Decision on Further
Strengthening the Work of Talented
Personnel. It emphasized that ‘China
must incorporate the work of
talented personnel in the overall
planning of national socio-economic
development, vigorously develop
human resources and reinvigorate
the nation by using its talent’.

via its Recruitment Programme of Global Experts,
known as the Thousand Talents Programme. This
programme plans to recruit 2 000 overseas experts
over the next five to ten years for national laboratories,
leading enterprises and selected research institutes, 
as well as a number of universities.

I In order to woo talented Chinese scientists and

engineers living abroad in particular, the government
is backstopping efforts by enterprises to reform
income distribution and incentive measures for staff by
implementing preferential policies that include special
government subsidies, tax breaks and benefit-sharing
arrangements for original patents.

Eighth thrust: support endogenous innovation via
financial measures
I The government has instructed policy-oriented

funding bodies to give priority to financing national
megaprojects for S&T, national projects for the
industrialization of high technology, the assimilation of
imported advanced technology and the export of
high-tech products. 

I To ease the financial burden on small and medium-
sized enterprises, the government has improved the
financial services available to them for innovation,
established a credit system for them and facilitated
venture capital. In parallel, it has improved the legal
framework for innovation by making it easier for
venture capital to invest in start-ups. 

THE NATIONAL S&T PROGRAMMES 

China’s national S&T programmes encompass three major
programmes:

I the National Programme for High-tech R&D

(the 863 programme), which received an allocation
from the central government of 5.6 billion Yuan 
(US$ 805.2 million) in 2008;

I the National Programme for Key Technology R&D,

which received an allocation of 5.1 billion Yuan 
(US$ 729.5 million) in 2008;

I the National Programme for Key Basic R&D

(the 973 programme), which received 1.9 billion Yuan
(US$ 273.6 million) in 2008.

In 2008, these three programmes represented two-thirds
(12.6 billion Yuan) of the central government’s allocation
to national S&T programmes (17.6 billion Yuan). A further
1.8 billion Yuan went to the national programme for the
construction of basic infrastructure like national key
laboratories, which consumed most of its budget 
(1.6 billion Yuan). 

A further 3.2 billion Yuan went to national policy-oriented
programmes and special programmes. Their budget
encompasses the:
I Innovation Fund for Small Technology-based Firms

(1.462 billion Yuan); 

I International S&T Co-operation Programme 

I The government has established multiple capital

(400 million Yuan); 

markets to support endogenous innovation, including
a stock market for technology-based small and
medium-sized enterprises, stock transactions for high-
tech enterprises and a regional transaction market for
property rights. 

7. The Spark Programme was launched in 1986 to promote S&T development
in rural areas, raise rural productivity and promote an S&T-based rural economy.

8. Launched in August 1988, the Torch Programme focuses on the
development of high-tech industries. Implemented via project demonstration,
the Torch Programme aims to commercialize those high-tech products with
good market prospects and to develop new products in high-tech and related
industries. This includes establishing some high-tech industrial development
zones around China.

9. Soft science is interdisciplinary research involving natural and social sciences,
engineering and mathematics in support of the decision-making process. 

I Agricultural S&T Transfer Fund (300 million Yuan);
I Special Technology Development Project for

Research Institutes (250 million Yuan);
I Spark Programme7 (200 million Yuan); 
I Torch Programme8  (152 million Yuan); 
I National New Products Programme (150 million Yuan);
I Soft Science Programme9 (25 million Yuan);
I other special programmes (300 million Yuan).

Last but not least, the National Natural Science
Foundation of China increased its project funding 
for basic research from 4.1 billion Yuan in 2006 to 
6.3 billion Yuan in 2008. However, the growth rate of
expenditure on basic research remains lower than that 
of R&D expenditure because of the rapid expansion of
experimental development in enterprises (see page 389).

The R&D priorities of the three main programmes
China’s national S&T programmes have set their priorities
for R&D according to the five strategic areas identified in
the Outline of the Medium- and Long- Term Plan for National
Science and Technology Development (2006–2020). During
2006–2008, the central government’s appropriation for
these five strategic areas accounted for 90% of the budget
allocated to the three major national S&T programmes
(MOST, 2009b):

I Energy resources and environmental protection: 

10.1 billion Yuan (19.8% of the total appropriation);

I IT, new materials and manufacturing: 12.2 billion Yuan

(23.8% of the total appropriation);

I Agriculture, population and health: 11.9 billion Yuan

(23.8% of the total appropriation);

I Space and ocean technology: 2.5 billion Yuan 

(4.9% of the total appropriation);

I Basic sciences and frontier technology: 9.7 billion Yuan

(19% of the total appropriation).

National Programme for High-tech R&D
The 863 programme covers 10 fields of technology. 
In 2008, the programme approved 1 220 new projects
spread fairly evenly across all 10 fields, half of the projects
being related to agriculture, materials science, biotech-
nology and IT. Funding, on the other hand, tended to
favour IT (see, for example, Box 3), followed by materials
science, energy, biotechnology and ocean science 
(Figure 1). Universities undertake 57.9% of ongoing
projects within the 863 programme, compared to 28.5%
for research institutes and just 13.5% for enterprises.
Interestingly, enterprises fund much more R&D than they
perform within the 863 programme: (24.4%), compared to
43.7% for universities and 31.7% for research institutes. 

National Programme for Key Technology R&D
The National Programme for Key Technology R&D covers
11 fields. In 2008, it approved 140 new projects (Figure 2).
The central government appropriation was largest by far
for agriculture (20.1%). Within this programme,

universities undertake 26.4% of projects, compared to
18.1% for research institutes and 44.4% for enterprises.
Other players account for 11.1% of these projects. 

National Programme for Key Basic R&D 
The 973 programme covers eight fields. Since, 2006, it has
also been supporting the National Special Science Research
Programme, which consists of four evenly balanced key
research projects: nano-research, development and
reproduction research, protein research and quantum
manipulation. In 2008, the National Special Science
Research Programme accounted for 20.8% of the
government appropriation (Figure 3). The same year, the 
973 programme approved 79 new projects in the eight
traditional fields and 35 new projects within the National
Special Science Research programme. In addition to these
new projects, there were 274 ongoing projects within the
973 programme in the eight traditional fields and 82 within
the National Special Science Research Programme.
Universities undertake more than half (54.5%) of all ongoing
projects within the 973 programme, research institutes and
enterprises performing 41.9% and 3.1% of R&D respectively.

R&D INPUT
A steep rise in R&D expenditure 
In less than a decade, China has become one of the
world’s biggest spenders on R&D10. Between 2000 and
2008, GERD leapt from 89.6 billion Yuan (US$ 10.8 billion)
to 461.6 billion Yuan (US$ 66.5 billion), at an average
annual growth rate of 22.8%. The ratio of GERD to GDP in
China has likewise increased: from 0.90% in 2000 to
1.54% 2008 (Figure 4). Despite this performance, China’s
R&D intensity still lags behind that of most developed
countries. At US$ 368.1 billion, GERD in the USA was
about 5.5 times that of China in 2007, for example, and
58.5 times that of India (World Bank, 2009). In 2008, the
GERD/GDP ratio was 2.67% in the USA, 3.40% in Japan
and 1.80% in the UK (see page 62). The Medium- and
Long- Term Plan does, however, fix the target of raising
China’s GERD/GDP ratio to 2.50% by 2020.

In China, the lion’s share of GERD goes to experimental
development (83%), compared to just 5% for basic
research (Figure 5). Despite basic sciences and frontier
research being one of the five strategic areas for R&D to
2020, the share of GERD devoted to basic research
actually dropped in China between 2004 and 2008
from 5.96% to 4.78%, even if expenditure on basic
research nearly doubled from 11.72 to 22.08 billion
Yuan over the same period. Although the R&D
expenditure of enterprises leapt from 131.40 billion to
338.17 billion Yuan over the same period, the majority
of this expenditure goes to experimental development.
Among industrial enterprises with total revenue from
product sales of over 5 million Yuan for example, R&D
expenditure amounted to 307.31 billion Yuan in 2008,
98.55% of which was destined for experimental
development (NBS and MOST, 2010).

Business enterprises have become big R&D spenders,
contributing 59.95% of GERD in 2000 and 73.26% in
2008 (Table 1). There are two reasons for 
this rapid growth. Firstly, more and more enterprises
have come to regard innovation capacity as a core
competence. Some Chinese firms are expanding their
R&D activities globally. For example, Huawei has set 
up five research institutes in Silicon Valley and Dallas
(USA), Bangalore (India), Sweden and Russia to access

10. R&D expenditure in the present chapter refers to intramural R&D
expenditure.

world knowledge (OECD, 2008). Other enterprises like
Lenovo and GEELY are accessing foreign R&D resources
by means of transnational acquisitions. This phenomenon
is also being observed in India (see page 363). Secondly,
many public research institutes have been transformed
into technology-based enterprises and are thus also
playing a role in improving the innovation capacity of
industry. 

One of the world’s biggest reservoirs of R&D
personnel
China has become one of the world’s biggest reservoirs 
of R&D personnel. The number of scientists and
engineers more than doubled between 2000 and 2008
to 1.59 million (Table 2). Over the same period, both the
share of GDP and the share of GERD spent on each
researcher likewise increased. Despite this feat, the
density of researchers in China remains lower than that
of developed countries, even if China is rapidly closing
the gap. In 2007, there were 1 071 researchers per million
population in China, compared to 5 573 in Japan, 4 663
in the USA (2006), 3 532 in Germany and 4 181 in the UK
(see page 8).

R&D OUTPUT
Only the USA and Japan now publish more
China has become one of the world’s most prolific
countries for scientific authorship. In 2000, it ranked eighth
in the world, according to the database of Thomson
Reuters’ Science Citation Index (SCI). By 2007, it had
climbed to third place. Over the same period, the number
of SCI papers published by Chinese researchers nearly
tripled from 30 499 to 89 147, representing an average
growth rate of 17.3% (NBS and MOST, 2010). However, the
average citation rate for Chinese papers in the Essential
Science Indicators database during the period 1999–2008
was only 4.61 (Table 3). This indicates that there is still a
wide gap in the quality of scientific publications between

China and the world leaders in S&T. Of note is that China
and India share a similar citation rate. (See pages 374 and
375 for a comparison of Brazilian, Indian and Chinese
papers recorded in the SCI database between 2000 and
2008.) China is most influential in materials science,
where it represented 20.83% of global output between
2004 and 2008 (Table 4). 

Rapid growth in patents
China has become one of the most prolific countries 
in terms of applications for, and grants of, domestic
resident invention patents (Figure 6). Moreover, in 2008,
a total of 77 501 domestic resident invention patents
were granted in the USA, about 1.66 times as many as in
China.

UNESCO SCIENCE REPORT 2010

The efficiency of Chinese researchers in terms of
invention patents is much lower than that of most
developed countries. Some 22.4 domestic resident
invention patents were granted per thousand
researchers in China in 2007, compared to 412.9 
in the Republic of Korea, 204.3 in Japan, 45.6 in
Germany and 63.0 in the USA (2006). The landscape
for filing within the Patent Co-operation Treaty
(PCT) offers almost the same view. In 2007, China
filed 3.8 PCT patents per thousand researchers, far
fewer than Germany (62.7), Japan (39.1) or the USA
(36.0) [Table 5].

China

High-tech industries in China have experienced rapid
growth in the past 10 years. The value of gross industrial
output of high-tech industries leapt between 2000 and
2008 from 1 041.1 billion Yuan (US$ 125.8 billion) to 
5 708.7 billion Yuan (US$ 822.0 billion). Over the same
period, the number of employees more than doubled
from 3.9 million to 9.5 million.

R&D expenditure by high-tech industries tripled in just five
years: from 22.2 billion Yuan in 2003 to 65.5 billion Yuan in
2008, growing at an average annual rate of 24.1%.
Electronics and telecommunications accounted for 61.5% of
all high-tech expenditure on R&D in 2008 (Figure 7). Despite
these impressive figures, the R&D intensity of high-tech
industry in China remains much lower than that of
developed countries. In 2008, the ratio of R&D expenditure
to the value of gross industrial output of high-tech
industries was just 1.15% in China. This was much lower
than the 2006 ratio for the USA (16.41%), the UK (11.04%),
Japan (10.64%), Germany (8.34%) or the Republic of Korea
(5.98%), according to the 2008 databases of the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
(OECD) on Structural Analysis Statistics (STAN) and Analytical
Business Enterprise Research and Development (2009).

R&D personnel in high-tech industries in China has
experienced remarkable growth, after a fleeting dip from

2003 to 2004. In 2008, there were 285 100 full-time
equivalent researchers, more than twice the number in
2003. Not surprisingly, 60.4% of R&D personnel working
for high-tech industries were employed in electronics and
telecommunications in 2008 (Figure 8).

The number of applications for invention, utility model and
design patents in high-tech industries grew annually by
36.8% during 2003–2008. Again, electronics and
telecommunications accounted for 65.3% of the total in
2008. However, the fastest annual growth (50.6%) concerned
medical equipment and measuring instruments (Figure 9).

The share of high-tech exports in manufactured exports
grew steadily in China between 2000 and 2008, at 8.1%
per year. Many dominant players in S&T saw this
percentage decline over the same period (Figure 10).
Notwithstanding this, China is still a net technology
importer. In 2008, China paid US$ 10.3 billion in royalties
and license fees, earning receipts of only US$ 570.5 million
(State Administration of Foreign Exchange, 2010). The
same year, China spent US$ 27.1 billion on imported
technology from 82 countries. Of this, US$ 23.5 billion
corresponded to technology and US$ 3.6 billion to
equipment. Four countries account for two-thirds of
China’s technology imports: the USA (18.71%), Japan
(17.93%), Republic of Korea (12.15%) and Germany (11.75%).

Measuring China’s capacity to innovate
The National Innovative Development Index
The National Innovative Development Index (NIDI) covers
five areas, namely:

I Industrialization: this represents the transition from a
rural economy to an industrial economy characterized
by a high S&T content, good economic returns, lower
resource consumption, less environmental pollution
and a wide spectrum of human resource advantages;
I ‘Informationization’: this refers to the development of an

information society via the utilization of information
technology, information exchange and knowledge sharing.

I Urbanization;
I Education and health;
I Science, technology and innovation.

According to the China Innovation Development Report (CAS,
2009), China’s NIDI experienced fairly rapid growth between
2000 and 2006 of 5.3% per annum. Even so, there remains a
yawning gap between China and developed countries for this
index. China’s NIDI amounted to just 20.94, placing it far
behind the leader, Sweden (67.01), and 32nd out of the 
34 countries studied in 2006, which included the member

states of the European Union, Canada, Japan, the Republic of
Korea and USA. China ranked higher than South Africa (33rd)
and India (34th) but trailed Brazil (27th), Mexico, Russia,Turkey
and Romania. China performed best for education (28th) and
worst when it came to industrialization that was respectful of
the environment (34th). 

The National Innovation Capacity Index
In a broad sense, a country’s national innovation capacity is
its ability to transform STI into wealth. The National
Innovation Capacity Index (NICI) is determined not only by
the efficiency and intensity of innovation but also by the
scale of it. According to the China Innovation Development
Report (2009), China’s NICI shot up from 6.96 in 2000 to
19.59 in 2007. This performance was more the result of
greater intensity in innovative activity than a reflection of
its efficiency. Between 2000 and 2006, China experienced
the fastest growth in national innovation capacity of all 
38 countries under study, with an annual growth rate of
over 16% which saw it climb to 17th place by 2006, between
Ireland and Austria. However, China’s NICI still fell far short
of the countries which topped the index, the USA (56.96),
Japan (36.75) and Sweden (26.63). For this indicator, Russia
ranked 25th, Brazil 32nd, South Africa 33rd and India 37th.

INTERNATIONAL CO-OPERATION IN S&T

In recent years, China has expanded the scale and scope of
international co-operation considerably. By the end of 2008,
China had established collaborative partnerships in S&T with
152 countries and regions, and signed 104 agreements with
the governments of 97 countries and regions (MOST, 2009a). 

The Chinese government is paying great attention to
developing international co-operation in order to improve
the country’s capacity for innovation. In 2006, it issued the
Outline for the Eleventh Five–Year Plan for Implementing
International S&T Cooperation to diversify the fields
covered by co-operation and improve the effectiveness of
these partnerships.

In 2001, the government launched the International
Science and Technology Co-operation Programme (ISTCP).
The ISTCP budget increased steadily over the next seven
years from 100 million Yuan to 400 million Yuan in 2008
(NBS and MOST, 2009). In 2001, the National Natural
Science Foundation of China created a special fund for

international S&T co-operation, the budget of which had
nearly doubled by 2008 from 63.9 million Yuan to 
144.4 million Yuan. 

Over the same seven-year period, the flow of foreign
scientists to China exceeded the number of Chinese
scientists going abroad, even if the number of mobile
Chinese scientists increased gradually from 48 616 in 2001
to 69 125 in 2008. A growing number of Chinese scientists
are attending international conferences and participating 
in international collaborative research. The number of
scientists coming to China has almost tripled from 32 472 
in 2001 to 99 955 in 2008 (Figure 11).

International co-operation in China has gradually evolved
from personal exchanges, communications among
academics and the importation of technology to joint
research projects, the joint establishment of research
institutions and Chinese participation in, or initiation, of
megaprojects. China has participated, or is participating,
in major international projects that include the European
Union’s Galileo Global Navigation Satellite System,

the Human Genome Project, the Global Earth Observation
System, the Integrated Ocean Drilling Programme and the
International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (Box 6).

Among programmes initiated by China, both the
International S&T Co-operation on Traditional Chinese
Medicine Programme launched in 2006 and the
International S&T Co-operation on New and Renewable
Energy Programme launched in 2007 are noteworthy.

International co-operation has produced some
remarkable results, as manifested by the rapid growth in
joint scientific publications and the rise in both patent
applications and technology trade. Chinese scientists
co-author articles mostly with their peers from the USA,
Japan, the UK, Germany, Canada and Australia. However,
co-publications are growing fastest with scientists from
Sweden and the Republic of Korea, followed by Canada,
Singapore, Australia and the USA (Figure 12).

Box 6: China’s role in an international clean energy project

First proposed in 1985, the International
Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor
(ITER) is the second-biggest inter-
national science and engineering
project after the International Space
Station. 

ITER is also the most ambitious
international project in which China
has taken part so far. China began
negotiating its participation in ITER in
2003 before officially signing the ITER
Agreement in November 2006. As one
of the discretionary and independent

members, China will assume 9.09% of
the cost of construction and spend
over US$ 1 billion in total. Some 
1 000 Chinese scientists will participate
in the ITER project. 

According to the Procurement

Arrangement, China will be in charge 
of developing, installing and testing 
12 components, including magnet
supports, correction coils and feeders. In
February 2007, the State Council
authorized the launch of a domestic
support programme to fulfil China’s

obligations vis-à-vis ITER and make full
use of the facility once construction has
been completed in 2018 or thereabouts.

ITER Director-General Kaname

Ikeda has commented that, ‘Like other
big powers in the world, China,
realizing fully the significance of clean
energy, is actively taking part in this
ITER project, which I think is key to the
success of the project’.

CONCLUSION

REFERENCES

The series of policies issued by the Chinese government in
the past four years for making China an innovation-driven
nation by 2020 provide a wide spectrum of measures for
inciting enterprises to invest more in innovation and
wooing talented scientists living overseas back to serve
their homeland. 

However, a host of barriers still restrain the development
of national innovation capacity in China, especially that of
enterprises. This supposes paying greater attention to the
three following factors in promoting the development of
STI:

I Firstly, the innovation risk of enterprises needs to 

be shared via incentive policies and the development 
of public infrastructure to support innovation. 
In parallel, it should be made difficult for enterprises 
to generate enormous profits without investing 
massively in innovation.

I Secondly, systematic innovation and the exploration of

emerging technology must be supported so that
breakthroughs become commonplace and Chinese
industry is able to leapfrog over leading or emerging
industries elsewhere.

I Thirdly, the government should continually increase

investment in innovation and shape favourable market
demands for technology, in order to stimulate the flow
of innovative talents from universities and research
institutes to enterprises.

INTRODUCTION

Japan’s socio-economic system underwent a major structural
reform in the first decade of the 21st century. The top priority
for the nation at the turn of the century was to recover from
the prolonged economic distress caused by the collapse of
the ‘bubble economy’ in the 1990s. In an effort to regain its
industrial vigour in an increasingly competitive global
environment, Japan opted for small government. By
streamlining the public sector and promoting market
competition, it sought to rebuild its economic strength. 

The central figure in the reform was Junichiro Koizumi,
Prime Minister of Japan from 2001 to 2006. Backed by
strong public support, Koizumi made bold policy moves.
First and foremost, his Cabinet accelerated the disposal of
the huge bad debts that Japanese banks had accumulated
in the 1990s, by supplying them with taxpayers’ money.
This initiative actually succeeded in mending Japan’s
financial system. Other factors, such as near-zero interest
rates, depreciation of the yen (which favours Japan’s export
industry) and expansion of the foreign economy, also
contributed to a gradual, yet sustained recovery of Japan’s
economy. In February 2002, Japan entered a period of
economic upturn which lasted until October 2007.

Japan would not escape the global recession, however.
The financial crisis triggered by the upset of the US
financial market, along with the rising prices of oil and
other natural resources, has seriously affected Japan’s
economy: Japan’s real GDP growth, which had hovered
around 2% from 2003 to 2007, plunged below zero in
2008.1 The world’s largest automobile manufacturer,
Toyota, which in 2007 had made its biggest profit ever,
suddenly found itself in the red in 2008. A number of major
companies filed for bankruptcy and the unemployment
rate rose from 3.9% in 2007 to over 5% in 2009.

Apart from this acute crisis, Japan’s economy faces more
fundamental, long-term challenges. In the past 20 years and
particularly during the second half of the 1990s, the Japanese
government has spent extravagantly on public works to
stimulate the economy. As a result, government debt has
soared to the point where it easily exceeds annual GDP. 

In addition, the cost of social security has been rising rapidly
because of the steady growth in the aged population2
(Table 1). This critical fiscal situation is becoming a serious
hindrance to policy planning and implementation in Japan.

Today, Japan is struggling to identify the right approach to
cope with these impending and long-term problems. The
reform promoted by Koizumi temporarily buoyed Japan’s
economy but it also brought about grave social changes.
Whereas large corporations have benefited from the
deregulation of labour policies, many young people are
discovering employment insecurity. Income disparities are
growing, eroding the stable consumption capacity of the
large middle class that has long characterized Japanese
society. The Koizumi reform has also magnified disparities
between large cities like Tokyo and rural areas, which now
suffer from depopulation and ageing. 

Since Koizumi resigned in 2006, Japan’s prime minister 
has changed often, leaving Japanese policy-makers still
searching for the right policy direction. 

Adding to the uncertainty has been the surprise 
ousting of the Liberal Democratic Party in the elections 
of August 2009, after half a century of nearly unbroken
rule. The new Japanese Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama 
of the Democratic Party vowed to radically change how
the country was run, declaring an end to bureaucratic
control over policy-making. However, Hatoyama's political
and diplomatic inexperience led to his resignation in June
2010. The formidable array of political and economic
problems facing Japan were thus passed on to the new
Prime Minister Naoto Kan.

In this period of uncertainty, however, there is a firm
consensus among Japanese politicians, bureaucrats and
industrialists on the cardinal importance of science and
technology (S&T) and the need to foster innovation. 
They all consider that the survival and prosperity of Japan, 
a country lacking in natural resources and now facing a
shrinking labour force, critically depends on its capacities 
in S&T. Even in today’s extremely tight fiscal situation, 
S&T receives a high priority in the nation’s public spending.
At the same time, shaping effective S&T and innovation
policies has climbed to the top of the national agenda.

1. According to the International Monetary Fund’s forecast published in
October 2009, Japan’s economy contracted by 5.4% in 2009 and would
achieve only 1.7% growth in 2010.

2. The United Nations estimates that those aged over 60 years will
represent 31% of the Japanese population by 2020.

POLICY ENVIRONMENT

The Third Basic Plan for S&T
In Japan, it is the Council for Science and Technology Policy
(CSTP) which draws up the Science and Technology Basic
Plan, the most fundamental document on S&T policy in
Japan. The Science and Technology Basic Law (1995)
stipulated that the government should formulate such a
plan every five years. The one currently in effect is the Third
Science and Technology Basic Plan, issued in 2006 to cover
the fiscal years 2006–2010. It is a comprehensive
programme for the promotion of S&T in Japan, dealing with
such issues as government funding, development of human
resources, university–industry collaboration and so on.

The Third Science and Technology Basic Plan has inherited
some key policies from its predecessor issued in 2001. Both
plans pledged to promote basic research on a broad front,
while setting differentiated priorities for research and
development (R&D) corresponding to national and social
needs; both prioritized funding for four areas (life sciences,
information/telecommunications, environmental sciences
and nanotechnology/materials science) over four others
(energy, manufacturing technology, social infrastructure
and frontier exploration [oceans and space]). Both plans
also specified the amount of necessary government
funding for R&D; the Second Basic Plan called for 24 trillion
yen (PPP US$ 185 million) for fiscal years 2001–2005 and
the Third Basic Plan for 25 trillion yen (PPP US$ 193 million)
for 2006–2010. The actual spending for 2001–2005 was
21 trillion yen (PPP US$ 162 million), however; that for
2006–2010 is also expected to fall short of the target. 

With regard to the development of human resources, 
both Basic Plans have highlighted the need to increase 
the mobility of researchers and promote the activities of
young, female and foreign researchers. 

The Third Basic Plan did contain some new policy
initiatives, however. While it granted funding priorities to
the same four areas as the Second Basic Plan, it also
introduced such new concepts as ‘a critical R&D topic’,
‘strategic prioritized S&T’ and ‘key technology of national
importance,’ for the purpose of detailed prioritizing. Then,
in a separate policy document, CSTP specified 273 ‘critical
R&D topics’, from which it selected 62 under the category
of ‘strategic prioritized S&T’. CSTP also specified five ‘key
technologies of national importance’ requiring focused
funding: the next-generation supercomputer, the space
transportation system, the marine–Earth observation and
exploration system, fast-breeder reactor-cycle technology
and the X-ray free electron laser. Thus, the Third Basic Plan
created an elaborate framework for focused R&D investment.

Another key feature of the Third Basic Plan has been the
heavy emphasis on returning the fruits of R&D to
taxpayers through innovation. For that purpose, the plan
called for the further expansion and refinement of
competitive R&D funds, active support for high-risk
research and innovative R&D, and closer collaboration
between universities, industry and government. 
The plan also pointed to the goal of ‘enhancing the
competitiveness of universities’, envisioning Japanese
universities as leading the world in S&T and attracting
foreign scholars and students. 

These basic policies materialized in some new funding
programmes. In 2006, the programme for the Creation of
Innovation Centres for Advanced Interdisciplinary
Research was launched to build human and institutional
R&D capacities through close co-operation between
universities, industry and government. In 2007, the Global
Centres of Excellence Programme succeeded the 21st
Century Centres of Excellence Programme to provide 
150 centres of excellence with support for five years.

The same year, the World Premier International Research
Centre Initiative was launched to focus investment on just
five institutions to make them truly prominent research
centres with high visibility in the international community.
These five institutions are the: Advanced Institute for
Materials Research at Tohoku University; Institute for the
Physics and Mathematics of the Universe at the University
of Tokyo; Institute for Integrated Cell-Material Sciences at
Kyoto University; Immunology Frontier Research Centre at
Osaka University; and the International Centre for
Materials Nanoarchitectonics at the National Institute for
Materials Science.

As a whole, the Third Basic Plan reflected the global trends
encoded in the Science Agenda – Framework for Action,
adopted by governments at the World Conference on
Science in Budapest, Hungary, in 1999. As the Science
Agenda called for a closer partnership between science and
society, the Third Basic Plan made a commitment to ‘S&T
supported by society and people, and returning fruits to
them’. The Plan also adopted basic stances that are
consistent with the Science Agenda, such as the promotion
of international collaboration and the building-up of
human resources. Such principles structure Japan’s S&T
policies today.

Promoting innovation
In keeping with the Third Basic Plan’s policy of promoting
innovation, the Japanese government has taken a wide
range of measures. In October 2006, the Cabinet Office
established a committee to deliberate on a long-term
strategy dubbed Innovation 25. Authorized by the Cabinet in
June 2007, this strategy envisioned what Japanese society
would look like in 2025 and produced a roadmap of the
innovation needed to realize this vision. Meanwhile, the
Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) launched
the Innovation Superhighway Initiative in 2006; this scheme
set out to accelerate innovation through transdisciplinary
R&D, a smooth flow of knowledge between the R&D side of
product development and the market side, and close
collaboration among industry, universities and government.
This initiative led to an amendment of the Industrial
Technology Capability Enhancement Act in 2007, which
now mandates the government to reinforce the nation’s
capability in technology management. 

Some parliamentarians are also greatly concerned with
promoting innovation. In June 2008, the Japanese
parliament, the Diet, passed the Research and Development

Japan

Capability Enhancing Act. In Japan, most new bills are
introduced to the Diet by the relevant ministries; in the case
of this particular bill, it was drafted by parliamentarians, like
the Science and Technology Basic Law of 1995. On the
whole, its content was consistent with the policies
presented in the Third Science and Technology Basic Plan:
improving science education; fostering the mobility of
researchers; harnessing the capabilities of young, female
and foreign researchers; promoting international
collaboration and exchanges; allocating R&D funds
strategically; augmenting the flexibility of fiscal regulations
and so on. The overall aim of the Act was to shape an
efficient R&D system that would constantly generate
innovation. Parliamentarians have also taken initiatives in
specific S&T areas. The Aerospace Basic Act passed in May
2008 called for a new regime to shape strategies for Japan’s
space activities, urging a shift in the focus of Japan’s space
efforts from the development of new technologies per se to
using these technologies for the sake of society. Space
technologies can be used for environmental monitoring, for
disaster prevention via hazard mapping and monitoring of
earthquakes and volcanoes, for telecommunications, global
positioning and so on.

The promotion of innovation is a global trend but it takes
on special significance in the context of Japanese
industrial policy. Japanese manufacturers have
traditionally excelled in steadily improving production
processes and accumulating production know-how within
their organizations, ultimately achieving a high
performance and quality at competitive costs. But this
Japanese model is losing its effectiveness in many
industrial fields, as China, the Republic of Korea and other
nations with gross advantages in terms of labour costs
emerge as tough competitors. Under such circumstances,
Japanese manufacturers have come to believe that they
must constantly innovate to survive in the global market.
In short, they are experiencing a fundamental shift in the
premise of their enterprises.

One can see some clear signs of change in Japan’s
innovation system. For example, collaboration between
universities and industry has greatly expanded in recent
years. The number and scale of joint research projects and
contract research projects between the two sectors more
than doubled in the period 2002–2007. As we shall see
later, the number of patent licenses and transfers from
universities to industry has also increased dramatically.
On the other hand, the number of new university

start-ups has begun to drop after peaking at 245 in 2004;
venture capitalists are becoming less willing to invest in
new start-ups. Also, many university start-ups are facing
financial difficulties, despite multifaceted support from
the government. University–industry collaboration will
continue to be a key issue in the reform of Japan’s
innovation system (Table 2).

difference by collecting more donations and obtaining
more R&D funds but only a small number have actually
been able to make up the loss. While powerful universities
such as the University of Tokyo and Kyoto University now
prosper, thanks to a deluge of competitive funds, others
have slowed the pace at which they hire new faculty and
are spending less on R&D.

Reforming universities: a sector under intense pressure
Currently, universities in Japan are under intense pressure 
to change their mode of operation. In 2004, all national
universities in Japan were semi-privatized and transformed
into ‘national university corporations’. While these
universities still receive taxpayers’ money, they have
adopted new accounting systems incorporating corporate
accounting principles. They have strengthened their internal
governance by augmenting the authority of their
presidents, by setting up boards of directors whose
membership includes some members selected from beyond
the university walls and by subjecting themselves to a
system of external evaluation. Many regulations have been
abolished and both faculty and staff have lost their status as
public servants. This reform has increased the financial
autonomy and flexibility of national universities, as well as
that of their personnel, thereby encouraging university–
industry collaboration. It was also in line with Japan’s
national effort to promote innovation and, more generally,
with the nation’s fundamental policy of streamlining the
public sector and realizing small government.

In point of fact, however, many national university
corporations are now facing financial difficulties. In the
tight fiscal situation of recent years, the government has
begun cutting back the amount of money regularly
allocated for their operating costs by 1% each year. As
these universities rely on this funding source for nearly
half of their total income, this policy has dealt them a
severe blow. They have been expected to make up the

The amount of government subsidies for private
universities also began to decrease in 2007. With the 
18-year-old population shrinking in Japan, many private
universities will be forced to close down or merge with
one other. The academic sector as a whole is deeply
concerned about all of these trends and policy-makers
themselves are now re-examining the proper balance
between regular and competitive funding. 

International co-operation: using S&T for soft power
CSTP has always stressed the importance of international
co-operation in S&T but, in the past few years, it has gone
a step farther. After calling for the ‘strategic promotion of
international activities’ in the Third Basic Plan, CSTP issued
Towards the Reinforcement of Science and Technology
Diplomacy in May 2008. In this document, CSTP proposes
a new rationale for international activities: linking S&T and
diplomacy. In other words, it proposes enhancing Japan’s
‘soft power’ by actively utilizing its capacity in S&T to help
resolve global issues and carry out co-operative
programmes with other countries. Thus, the idea of ‘S&T
diplomacy’ reflects Japan’s national interests – but also
espouses the ideals set out in the Science Agenda adopted
in Budapest in 1999 to use S&T for the welfare of
humankind. Ultimately, the goal of S&T diplomacy is to
contribute to the world’s sustainable development and
construct mutually beneficial relationships with partners. 

To materialize the concept of S&T diplomacy, relevant
ministries have begun designing new frameworks for

international co-operation. In 2008, the Ministry of
Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology
(MEXT) and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MoFA)
launched a joint programme called the Science and
Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable
Development. Under this scheme, researchers from Japan
and developing countries co-operate to tackle problems
in such areas as environment, energy, natural disasters
and infectious diseases. These ministries have also
launched a programme to send Japanese researchers to
developing countries. In order to expand the reach of
international co-operation in S&T, Japan is now actively
participating in dialogue with Asian and African countries
in a variety of high-level meetings.

R&D INPUT

Rising R&D expenditure
Japan’s gross domestic expenditure on R&D (GERD)
climbed steadily between 2002 and 2007. This reflects the
economic upturn of the period and the growing
awareness by Japanese firms of the critical role R&D plays
in their competitiveness. As a result, Japan’s GERD/GDP

ratio, which had long been high by international
standards, climbed even higher to 3.67% in 2007. 

A drop in government funding
In parallel, government expenditure on R&D decreased 
over the same period. This is largely due to fluctuating
extraordinary spending: the Diet frequently approved 
large supplementary budgets around the turn of the
century to stimulate the lagging economy but such extra
spending became modest after 2003. Nevertheless, regular
government spending on R&D, which had consistently 
risen up until the turn of the century, has certainly stopped
growing in recent years, reflecting the nation’s increasingly
tight fiscal situation. As a result, Japan is becoming more
and more dependent on R&D funding from the private
sector (Figures 1 and 2).

As regards the focus of government spending on R&D, the
Second and Third Science and Technology Basic Plans stated
that basic research should be steadily promoted in all areas

of S&T, while specifying four priority areas that responded
to the needs of the nation and society. As we have seen
above, these areas are the life sciences, information/
telecommunications, environmental sciences and
nanotechnology/materials science. This policy has been
steadily reflected in the actual spending pattern. The ratio
of basic research funding to total government R&D funding
has risen from 39.6% (2002) to 42.3% (2007). Over the same
period, spending for non-basic research has decreased and
its allocation pattern has changed. The four high priority
areas have seen their shares rise to the detriment of two of
the other four areas: energy and frontier exploration. 
A gradual cutback in spending on both nuclear power
development and space development has contributed to
this trend. Overall, a ‘macroshift’ is evident in the allocation
of government R&D funding in Japan (Figure 3).

Rapid growth in competitive funds
Another important change in the structure of government
R&D funding is the rapid growth in the number and size of
competitive funds, allocated on the basis of merit. The
total amount of competitive R&D funds increased from
344 billion yen in 2002 to 477 billion yen in 2007. Many
new funds were instituted by MEXT, METI and other
ministries to cover various types of R&D activities. The
largest competitive fund in Japan, the Grants-in-Aid for
Academic Research, grew from 170 to 191 billion yen over
this five-year period; the fund is administered by MEXT
and the Japanese Society for the Promotion of Science. 

This expansion in competitive funding reflects CSTP’s
intention to render Japan’s R&D environment more
vigorous and competitive. CSTP has also adopted a policy

406

Japan chapter [8] [P3]:Layout 1  18/10/10  19:53  Page 407

of increasing the proportion of indirect costs in
competitive R&D funds to stimulate competition between
universities. In fact, the ratio of indirect costs to direct
costs in all competitive R&D funds grew from 7.7% in 2002
to 17.9% in 2007. Now, many universities see indirect costs
as a significant source of revenue and are encouraging
their faculty to apply for competitive R&D funds. 

A growing pool of researchers
There were 827 291 researchers in Japan in 2008, an
increase of 9.2% since 2003 (Figure 4). Most of this increase
has been borne by the industrial sector, although
universities and colleges have also taken on faculty. The
number of researchers per 10 000 population in Japan in
2008 was 64.8, one of the highest proportions in the world.
Any international comparison for this indicator should
inspire caution, however, since the method of counting
researchers varies greatly from one country to another. 

The number of female researchers in Japan has been growing
steadily but is still low compared to other countries.
In the Third Basic Plan, CSTP stated that one in four researchers
in Japan should be female. The government has taken various
measures to move towards this goal. For example, a
fellowship was created for female researchers wishing to
resume research activities after giving birth and raising
children. However, the actual ratio has only grown from 11.2%
(2003) to 13.0% (2008). Similarly, the proportion of foreign
researchers in Japan has remained modest. In 2008, just 3.5%
of university faculty members were foreign-born.

Decreasing numbers of doctoral students
The training of researchers in Japan is now at a crossroads.
Whereas the 18-year-old population in Japan has been
declining since the early 1990s, enrollment in higher
education has only tailed off recently after progressing
steadily until 2002. Since 2003, enrollment at the
bachelor’s level has stagnated and, at the doctoral level,
has begun a fairly rapid decline. Thus, from the perspective
of Japan’s S&T capacity, the problem of a shrinking
younger generation has entered a critical phase (Figure 5).

The recent decline in the number of doctoral students is a
manifestation of a crisis in human resources in S&T. There
was a great expansion in graduate education in Japan in the
1990s, in response to the expectation that demand for
highly educated talents would grow in the emerging
knowledge society. In reality, no such demand has
eventuated in the academic, public or private sectors,

especially for those with doctoral degrees. As a result, many
doctorate-holders have been left without stable
employment. The number of postdoctoral positions and
other non-permanent positions has grown, due to a
consistent increase in competitive R&D funds. But these
positions have not guaranteed job security and many
doctorate-holders cannot even accede to these positions. 
As word has got round, many students have simply stopped
applying for doctoral programmes, despite the government
schemes expanding financial support for them. 

In an effort to solve this problem, the Japanese
government has launched various initiatives to develop
diverse career paths for doctoral students and
postdoctorates. New programmes have allowed them 
to acquire a broad range of skills and to experience
internships, in order to smooth their transition to the
private sector. They have also been expected to seek
opportunities at the interface between S&T and society.
For example, there is a growing demand for S&T experts 
in the intellectual property departments of universities.
Strengthening these departments would accelerate
university–industry collaboration and lead to more
innovation. Another area where doctorate-holders could
use their expertise is science communication; this would
not only earn public support for S&T but also attract
young students to S&T professions. In reality, however,
such new paths for doctoral students and postdocs 
have done little to solve the problem of employment
insecurity. The overwhelming imbalance between supply
and demand for doctorate-holders will take many years 
to absorb.

As for the Japanese government’s efforts to promote the
international exchange of researchers, these have yielded
mixed results. The number of foreign students studying in
Japan has grown considerably since 2001, thanks to

fellowships designed especially for them. Yet, the number
of foreign researchers staying in Japan for longer than 
30 days has actually decreased, as has the number of
Japanese researchers who stay abroad for more than 
30 days (Table 3). These figures indicate that Japanese
researchers are becoming increasingly inward-looking
and are being left out of the international network of
researchers. According to a survey conducted by MEXT 
in 2007, Japanese researchers, especially young ones,
hesitate to go abroad mainly because they worry about
finding positions on their return to Japan and do not see 
a possible economic return on their investment. Within
the government, there is a growing sense of crisis about
this trend, even if the government has not yet managed 
to take effective measures to remedy the situation. 

R&D OUTPUT
Trends in scientific publications
Japan’s world share of scientific publications has dropped
in the past few years. Whereas the nation produced 10.0%
of the world’s scientific papers in 2002, according to the
Science Citation Index, its share had dropped to 7.6% by
2007 (see page 10). Although this is largely due to the
rapid growth of scientific publications in China, Japan’s
share has declined faster than that of other member
countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development (OECD). It is difficult to analyse here
precisely what factors contributed to such a decline but
stagnating R&D input in Japan has possibly played a role.
As discussed above, the amount of government
expenditure on R&D fell between 2002 to 2007, while the
number of researchers in Japanese universities grew only
slowly over the same period. Japan’s share of the top 10%
of scientific publications also fell, from 8.2% in 2002 to
7.5% in 2007.

Japan remains strong in chemistry, materials science,
physics and space science. In each of these fields, Japan’s
world share of publications is around 10.0% and its world
share of the top 10% of publications is even higher.
Japan’s performance is less impressive in other fields, such
as computer science and mathematics or environmental
and Earth sciences. Japan is also traditionally weak in
clinical medicine, although its performance has improved
slightly in recent years (Table 4).

of all scientific papers in Japan in 2007. This percentage is
a little higher than the world average but significantly
lower than that for most OECD countries. This is mainly
because European nations enjoy geographical and
institutional advantages that allow them to form a huge
network of researchers, as in the USA. Again, Japanese
researchers appear to be less tightly integrated in the
international network of researchers than their foreign
counterparts (Figures 6 and 7). 

Reflecting the trend towards internationalization of R&D,
researchers throughout the world are producing greater
numbers of internationally co-authored publications and
the Japanese are no exception. Scientific papers co-
authored with non-Japanese scientists represented 23.9%

Patents: from quantity to quality
The total number of patent applications to the Japan Patent
Office has been gradually falling. Whereas there were 
421 000 applications in 2002, this number had dropped to
just 396 000 by 2007. Behind this trend lies a fundamental

change in the patent strategies of Japanese firms. Many
have been refraining from filing large quantities of patents
for mainly defensive purposes, instead focusing their efforts
on obtaining high-quality patents to help develop their
core businesses. Also, firms have adopted the strategy of
not applying for patents, choosing instead to hide new
technologies within their organizations whenever this
would appear to secure their competitive edge. 

At the same time, Japanese firms are now placing greater
emphasis on filing patents overseas. Their patent strategies
are evidently acquiring a global perspective. If the share of
Japanese applicants in total patent applications to the
Japan Patent Office fell from 87.7% in 2002 to 84.2% in
2007, Japanese firms applied for many more patents to the
USA, Europe, China and elsewhere in 2007 than in 2002
(Table 5). The number of Japanese patent applications

under the Patent Co-operation Treaty, which was
concluded in 1970 to facilitate international applications,
also increased from 14 000 in 2002 to 27 000 in 2007. These
figures indicate a steady trend towards internationalization. 

Another notable trend in patent activity in Japan is the
deepening involvement of the academic sector. In 1999, the
Diet passed legislation granting Japanese universities the right
to pursue intellectual property rights arising from government-
funded R&D. This legislation, also known as the Japanese
version of the Bayh-Dole Act3, spurred the patent activities of
Japanese universities. The number of patent applications,
patent licenses and transfers by universities showed impressive
growth from 2002 to 2007. However, the growth in total income
earned by universities through patents was less spectacular.
So far, patent activities have not become a significant source
of income for Japanese universities (Figure 8).

CONCLUSION

Since the turn of the century, S&T in Japan has been
metamorphosed by the changing socio-economic
environment in which it operates. Under severe fiscal
pressure, the government has begun capping growth in
government R&D expenditure, striving to allocate its
limited resources in a strategic manner. CSTP has been the
architect of this strategy. As we have seen, particular areas
have received priority over others and the number and
size of competitive R&D funds have grown. 

These policy initiatives have not visibly improved Japan’s
performance in the academic sector, however; Japan’s
share of scientific publications has even declined in recent
years. Nor has the training of the next generation of
researchers been going smoothly. The number of doctoral
students has begun dropping, as has the number of long-

term international exchanges of researchers. It is apparent
that Japan’s S&T policy has not fully met the challenges
posed by the evolution of society in a changing world.

An entirely new approach to policy-making may be
necessary. Over the past decade, Japanese policy-makers
have embraced competitive R&D funding, supported
centres of excellence and expanded non-permanent
positions in the academic sector. All of these initiatives,
however, were essentially appropriated from existing
foreign schemes, especially American ones. Introducing
such schemes quickly into Japan without taking into
consideration the wider socio-cultural context of
Japanese academia may have undermined the unique
strengths of the nation’s university system, which has its
own history and tradition, even if it may have also had the
merit of alleviating some of the university system’s
weaknesses. For example, the government’s policy of
focusing investment on the nation’s top universities may
have improved their performance but, at the same time,
damaged the R&D capacities of other universities, thereby
destroying the domestic networks of researchers along
with the diverse capabilities and approaches these have
to offer. Similarly, expanding non-permanent academic
positions through project-type competitive R&D funds
may have enhanced the domestic mobility of researchers
but also driven them into reckless competition, thereby
eroding the attractiveness of the academic profession. 

As such concerns are increasingly being voiced in the
academic community and among S&T policy researchers
in Japan, it may be necessary to reconsider thoroughly the
basic policies of the past 10 years. More generally, the
Japanese government would do well to exercise caution
in introducing foreign schemes; the strengths and
weaknesses of current schemes require more thoughtful
analysis and the impact of new initiatives needs to be
carefully assessed.

S&T in Japan’s private sector appears to be in better shape
than in the academic sector. Owing to the economic
upturn between 2002 and 2007, both R&D expenditure
and the number of researchers in the private sector have

Business Patent Procedures Act, gave universities, small businesses and
non-profit organizations in the USA the right to file for ownership of their
inventions and other intellectual property resulting from R&D funded by
the government. Prior to 1980, such intellectual property had basically
belonged to the government.

grown considerably. Although the number of patent
applications has recently been falling, this is largely due to
the changing patent strategies of corporations rather than
the weakening of their R&D performance. University–
industry collaboration has expanded greatly and many
new university start-ups have emerged, albeit with
uncertain financial prospects. Overall, Japanese industry is
investing heavily in R&D and making vigorous efforts to
generate innovation.

Japanese industry is also facing new challenges. Since the
1990s, competitive pressures from emerging nations such as
China and the Republic of Korea have driven many Japanese
firms to target the high end of the market. Yet recently, the
high end of the global market has been shrinking rapidly,
especially since the global recession hit wealthy consumer
countries in Europe and North America in 2008. In this new
market environment, developing high-quality, high-
performance, expensive products through intensive R&D
investment ceases to be an effective strategy. Japan’s world
share of mostly electronic products has dwindled, in fact, in
the past 10 years. 

Japan nevertheless maintains its predominant position in
such areas as automobiles, machine tools, digital cameras
and electronic components. These products typically have a
tightly integrated architecture; their development requires
exercising tacit know-how and intricate co-ordination, both
areas in which Japanese firms excel. Here again, however,
Japan faces a new challenge, as engineers and craftsmen
with this expertise begin retiring en masse. Whether
Japanese manufacturers can retain their unique strengths
will be a vital question for the future of Japanese industry.

In today’s world, Japan should be fully aware of global
trends and standards in shaping its S&T policies but that
does not mean foreign schemes and systems should be
quickly and blindly imported into Japan. Many of the
problems that Japan now faces in S&T seem to require
original strategies that take into consideration the nation’s
own unique strengths and weaknesses. Up until now,
Western policy models in general have had an almost
invincible power of persuasion among Japanese policy-
makers. A fundamental change in mindset is needed for
the sound and sustained development of S&T in Japan.

INTRODUCTION

In the Republic of Korea, the present government considers
science and technology (S&T) to be the core element for
achieving a number of national goals1. These goals include
acquiring the dual status of  ‘advanced country’ and world
power. The government also hopes that assigning a central
role to S&T will help to ensure economic growth,
strategically concentrate national resources on creative,
original research, build a more equitable and progressive
society, and promote prosperity in northeast Asia.

Although, in the past, economic growth in the Republic of
Korea relied on imitation, the country was able to
assimilate advanced technologies and improve on these
by considerably increasing investment in research and
development (R&D). Today, it aims to use innovation to
create added value and to increase gross domestic
expenditure on R&D (GERD) to 5% of GDP by 2012. This
target has become one of the country’s top priorities. 

The timetable for meeting this target has been contraried
by the global slowdown caused by the US subprime
mortgage crisis, which plunged the Korean economy into a
severe recession at the end of 2008. According to the Bank
of Korea, GDP shrank by 5.6% in the fourth quarter of 2008. 

However, thanks mainly to the government-led stimulus
packages to minimize the economic downturn, the
Korean economy expanded by 0.2% in 2009, the third-
highest growth rate among the 21 members of the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD), which unveiled preliminary growth
figures in February 2010. The OECD expects the Korean
economy to grow by 4.4% in 2010, the highest growth
rate among OECD countries (OECD, 2009). This is much
higher than the OECD average of a 1.9% growth rate.

The Korean government has tried to raise R&D
expenditure during the global economic recession, 
in order to stimulate national R&D and innovation. 
As a result, R&D investment in 2008 and 2009 by the
government and public sector increased by 13.5% and
11.4% respectively over the previous year. 

S&T POLICY INITIATIVES

In 2003, the Roh Moo-Hyun government established the
Planning Committee for a Science and Technology-oriented
Society and placed it within the Presidential Advisory
Council on Science and Technology. The Planning
Committee’s chairperson was the presidential secretary for
S&T. It was she who drafted the Roadmap for Building a
Science and Technology-oriented Society. The Ministry of
Science and Technology (MoST) set up its own Planning
Committee for a Science and Technology-oriented Society.
After many meetings and public hearings, this body
prepared a proposal and drafted general plans, including a
detailed methodology for building an S&T-oriented society.

As a result of these efforts, the Initiative for Establishing a
National Technology Innovation System, the government’s
practical strategy for building an S&T-oriented society, was
implemented in July 2004. Ministries identified five major
innovation areas with 30 priority tasks on which to focus.
This constituted the basic framework for Korea’s S&T
innovation policy under the Roh government (2003–2008).

The Science and Technology Basic Plan for 2008–2013
(known as the 577 Initiative2) of the new Lee Myung-Bak
government, which took office in February 2008, was
finalized by the National Science and Technology Council
(NSTC) in December 2008. This Plan consists of 50 priority
tasks for the next five years.  

Despite the global economic recession, GERD in 2008
amounted to 34 498.1 billion Korean won (KRW, about 
US$ 31.3 billion), an increase of 10.2% over the previous year.
R&D expenditure as a percentage of GDP was a healthy 3.37%,
an increase of 0.16% over 2007, equivalent to US$ 644 per
capita. 

A few months earlier, in August 2008, President Lee
Myung-Bak had declared a Low Carbon, Green Growth
policy as a key national agenda. Both the Science and
Technology Basic Plan and the Low Carbon, Green Growth
policy constitute the basic framework for the S&T policy of
the Lee government.

1. Much of this chapter is based on the White Paper on National Science and
Technology Policy from 2003 to 2007, published by the Korean Ministry of
Science and Technology in December 2007, and on the Science and
Technology Basic Plan of the Lee government, published in December 2008.
‘Korean’ in the present chapter refers to the Republic of Korea.

2. ‘577’ is a reference to three key digits: total R&D investment will reach 5%
of GDP by 2012; the Korean government will focus GERD on seven priority
S&T areas; and it will promote seven policy sectors, such as nurturing
human resources in S&T, promoting basic research and so on.

UNESCO SCIENCE REPORT 2010

Main thrusts of national S&T policies from 2003 
to 2012
After the basic S&T policy frameworks of the new
governments had been established, the Roh and Lee
administrations both prepared basic plans for the
implementation of these frameworks. Drafted in 
May 2003 and December 2008 respectively, these basic
plans for S&T set goals for key S&T sectors with quantified
targets and input and output categories (Table 1).

As for the Low Carbon, Green Growth policy, it aims to
promote the development of competitive green industries,
while at the same time improving the quality of life by

reducing CO2 emissions and saving resources and energy
through ‘green’ technological innovation (Korean
National Commission for UNESCO, 2009).

Main S&T policy focus and actions
Government action in the five main S&T policy areas from
2003 onwards can be summarized as follows. Firstly, the
Roh government elevated the Minister of Science and
Technology (MoST) to the level of Deputy Prime Minister
in 2004 and created the semi-autonomous Office of
Science and Technology Innovation within MoST to
support the NSTC and the S&T Deputy Prime Minister. 
In order to pursue national policy initiatives through S&T

policy, the S&T Deputy Prime Minister co-ordinated
industrial, human resource and regional policies. 

The S&T Deputy Prime Minister is responsible for overall
co-ordination of science, technology and innovation (STI)
policy, while serving as Vice-chair of the NSTC (Korean
National Commission for UNESCO, 2009).

KRW 66.5 trillion (equivalent to about US$55.4 billion)
over a five-year period (2008–2012). Also, tax incentives
for investment in R&D will be provided to foster private
expenditure on R&D, corporate research institutes will be
deregulated and the tax deduction rate of 7–10% will be
extended to a greater number of beneficiaries to facilitate
investment in R&D, among other measures.

Secondly, the Roh government chose a knowledge-based
technology development strategy. This entailed
increasing R&D investment in basic research in order to
strengthen the capacity to create new, high value-added
knowledge industries. In the past, S&T policies had relied
on imitation and R&D strategies for independent
development. 

Secondly, the Lee government will invest in strategic areas
for national R&D, such as basic research, emerging areas of
industrial technology and technology related to global
issues. Korea will also become a leading nation in the
‘green market’, which will be worth KRW 3 000 trillion
(equivalent to about US$ 2.5 trillion) by 2020, by more
than doubling R&D investment in green technologies. 

Thirdly, the Roh government advocated an S&T policy
ensuring both economic progress and a better quality 
of life, including by meeting social demands. 

Fourthly, the Roh government took a more global
perspective on S&T than the domestically centered policy
the government had adopted in the past. It sought to
liberalize S&T policy and strengthen international co-
operation, in particular with Northeast Asia, as well as
reduce the gap among regions caused by a regional bias
in the distribution of resources. The objective was not only
to reinforce the global competitiveness of Korean
industries and regions but also to increase domestic
cohesion and solidarity. 

Fifthly, the Roh government promoted private-sector
participation and appealed to society at large to develop
S&T. This approach was a departure from past practice
when S&T policy and participation had centered on
scientists and engineers. The government considered the
development of S&T to be an economic, social and
cultural reality in which all sectors of society should
participate and which called for high standards in ethics,
transparency and responsibility.

After the inauguration of President Lee Myung-Bak in
February 2008, the new government set about
reorganizing the system of S&T administration and
prepared the 577 Initiative. The main S&T policy areas of
the Lee government can be summarized as follows: 

Firstly, the Lee administration plans to increase R&D
investment to 5% of GDP by 2012. It will commit a total of

Thirdly, the Lee administration’s STI policy emphasizes
nurturing scientists and engineers who are capable of
conducting world-class research, along with a strategic
concentration of R&D resources on creative, original
research. In this context, the government plans to double
the share of basic research in total government
expenditure on R&D, while stepping up its efforts to
produce creative talents by integrating education with
S&T (Government of Republic of Korea, 2008).

Promoting innovation
From 2003 to 2009, more than 40 laws and ordinances
relating to S&T innovation were enacted. These involve
developing human resources; ensuring a safe research
environment; and establishing a system to promote
innovation and support technological innovation as a
basis for building an S&T-oriented society and becoming
one of the seven major S&T powers in the world by 2012. 
Key laws passed or amended during this period include
the Law on Government Organizational Structure, the
Basic Laws on Science and Technology and the Basic Laws
on Human Resources Development.

The government has also implemented policies to create
a favourable environment for technological innovation in
order to attract the best brains to science and engineering
and promote the development of new technologies 
(Box 1). For instance, it introduced a system encouraging
public institutions to employ scientists and engineers. 
As a result, the number of new recruits in public service at
Level 5 (director level) holding degrees in science and
engineering has increased from 158 (23.5%) in 2002 to 
185 (34.7%) in 2006.

UNESCO SCIENCE REPORT 2010

Furthermore, the Lee government has introduced plans to
improve R&D performance in specific areas, including bio-
engineering, the national satellite navigation system, the
integrated establishment of broadband and the
development of national nuclear fusion technology.

Administrative reorganization
In order to reinforce overall responsibility and co-ordination
of S&T innovation policies and relevant micro-economic
policies, the consecutive Roh and Lee governments have
proceeded with a series of administrative and organizational
changes. We have already seen that the Science and
Technology Minister was promoted to Deputy Prime
Minister in 2004 and that the Minister also holds the post of
Vice-Chair of the NSTC.

In order to ensure the planning and co-ordination of S&T
policies, the Roh government introduced ministry-wide R&D
programmes and established the ephemeral Office 
of Science and Technology Innovation (OSTI) within MoST. 
It consisted of specialists from the private sector (20%) and
civil servants from both relevant ministries (40%) and from
MoST (40%). OSTI was responsible for addressing specialized
S&T issues and for ensuring fairness and neutrality in the
formulation and implementation of S&T innovation policy
until it was abolished by the incoming Lee government. 

In addition, the Law on the Presidential Advisory Council on
Science and Technology (enacted in 1991) was amended to
reinforce the council’s status in 2004. A Presidential Advisor
for Information and Science and Technology was appointed
to assist the president in managing an enlarged council. The
law was subsequently revised in 2008 and renamed the Law
on the Presidential Advisory Council on Education, Science
and Technology.

Since the advent of the Lee government in February 2008,
not only has OSTI been abolished but MoST and the Ministry
of Education have also been merged to form the Ministry of
Education, Science and Technology (MEST)3, while the
Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Energy and the Ministry
of Communication have been merged to create the Ministry
of the Knowledge Economy (MKE). This consolidation has
been initiated by the new Korean President within an overall
drive to reduce the size of government and cut the number
of ministries in the executive branch (OECD, 2009).

S&T innovation policy integration, co-ordination,
evaluation and management
By introducing various administrative and organizational
changes to promote innovation, both the Roh and Lee
governments have reinforced the co-ordination, evaluation
and management function of S&T policy. This includes
giving authority to the NSTC to co-ordinate and evaluate
national R&D programmes. Up until 2008, it was also
responsible for distributing the budget for national R&D
programmes. Since 2008, NSTC has been responsible for
setting national R&D priorities, co-ordinating national R&D
programmes and so on. Responsibility for evaluating
national R&D programmes and distributing their resource
budget has fallen to the Ministry of Strategy and Finance.
Also, a Special Committee on National Defence R&D was set
up in 2007 to discuss and co-ordinate S&T policy-related
issues, including the allocation of the national defence R&D
budget among the relevant ministries (Figure 1). 

Greater co-ordination of current S&T policy can be seen in
the growing number of joint agendas submitted by more
than two ministries; these now exceed 40% of all submitted
agendas. For instance, various ministries are collaborating
on the new drug development programme (MEST, MKE and
Ministry of Welfare) and on the agriculture and forestry R&D
programme (Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, Rural
Development Administration and the Forest Service).

Greater support for government-funded research
institutions 
The government is also promoting R&D activities of
government-funded research institutes, which are key
performers of national R&D. The Roh government enacted
the Law on the Establishment, Management and
Development of Government-funded Research Institutions in
the Areas of Science and Technology (2004) and transferred
authority over research institutions to the NSTC to develop
closer ties between STI policy and R&D activities. However,
starting with the Lee administration, the government-funded
Research Institute was reorganized within the government’s
administrative reform in 2008 and authority over research
institutions was transferred to MEST and MKE.4

Furthermore, the Lee government has introduced measures
to promote specialized research programmes and

3. MEST continues to assume the role of NSTC Secretariat. 

4. There are now two research councils, the Research Council of Basic
Science and Technology under MEST and the Research Council of Industrial
Science and Technology under MKE.

established a mid-term strategy to ensure that R&D
resources and the capabilities of government-funded
research institutions are utilized efficiently.

A performance-based evaluation and management
system for R&D
In 2005, the government enacted the Law on the
Evaluation and Management of the Performance of
National R&D Programmes to enhance the efficiency of
these programmes. A year later, it implemented the Basic
Plan for Performance Evaluation (2006–2010), leading to
the establishment of a performance-based evaluation and
management system. Three years earlier, the Ministry of
Information and Communication – now part of MKE – had
implemented the Project Manager System to deal with
specialization issues in R&D management, such as
improving efficiency in R&D using the Six Sigma5 method.
The same year, it had established the National Science and
Technology Information System (2007–2009) for the
integrated management of S&T information. 

R&D INPUT

Greater government investment in R&D
Government investment in R&D has increased steadily
since 1993. In addition, diverse policies were pursued
from 2003 to 2009 to enhance the efficiency of R&D
investment. Over this period, the government share 
of the annual budget dedicated to R&D reached a total 
of KRW 42.4 trillion (US$ 31.9 billion), or some 
KRW 10 trillion (US$ 7.5 billion). From 2005 to 2009, 
total government investment in R&D increased by 12.2 %,
a considerably higher rate than the increase in total
government expenditure of about 8.0%. 

5. Originally developed by Motorola (USA) in the early 1980s for
manufacturing, this method of quality management has since been
extended to other business processes. It relies on analysis, statistical
methods and other means to achieve targets such as improved product
quality, better safety, greater profits or a faster delivery time.

Research and Development in Korea

Furthermore, the government diversified financial
resources for investment in R&D by issuing Government
Science and Technology Bonds (2006) and by establishing
the Daedeok Special Zone Fund, the Technology
Commercial ization Fund administered by MKE and the
Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises Fund administered
by the Small and Medium-Sized Business Administration.
The government also incited the private sector to invest
more in R&D via tax incentives and reductions, as we have
seen earlier. As a result, private sector investment grew at
an annual average rate of 12.3% from 2003 to 2008. GERD
consequently increased rapidly from KRW 17.3 trillion in
2002 (2.53% of GDP) to KRW 34.5 trillion in 2008 
(3.37% of GDP) [Table 2 and Figures 2 and 3].

Increasing the efficiency of R&D investment
As investment in R&D grew, new policies were
implemented to ensure that this investment would be
used efficiently. Changes included a medium and long-
term investment portfolio for the efficient use of limited 
R&D resources and a Total Roadmap for National R&D
Programmes. These were presented in 2006. A year later,
preliminary feasibility studies were introduced for large-
scale R&D programmes requiring a budget of more than
KRW 50 billion (US$ 37.6 million). In addition, the
government implemented a comprehensive plan for the
promotion of basic research (2005) and increased
investment in basic and fusion research with the aim of
developing independent fundamental technologies and
intellectual property. The public R&D budget share for

basic research increased from 19.0% in 2002 to 
23.1% in 2006 and an estimated 29.3 % in 2009. 
At the same time, the government boosted support 
for small-scale basic research projects, from 
KRW 263.2 billion (US$ 198 million) in 2004 to 
KRW 380.4 billion (US$ 286.5 million) in 2008.

Incentives for the private sector to innovate
In 2006, the government amended the Law for the
Transfer of Technology and secured adequate funding for
corporate R&D, in order to encourage innovation.
Corporations conduct about three-quarters of R&D in the
Republic of Korea, linking technology valuation with
financing. At the same time, the government provided tax
incentives to spur corporate R&D and innovation. These
incentives include more time to apply for tax deductions
on R&D, human resources development and investment in
installations (from the end of 2006 to the end of 2009), 
an increase in tax deductions from 40% to 50% on
outsourced research costs for large corporations and
income and corporate tax reductions for research
enterprises and cutting-edge technology companies in
Daedeok Innopolis.6 As a result of these measures, the
number of innovation enterprises increased substantially

6. Daedeok Innopolis is located near Daejeon. It has been designed to link
researchers and developers with capital so that they can run businesses or
take a share in a business. The main role of the organization is to translate
the results of R&D into business profits.

research centres of companies; from 1 856 to 
7 183 for innovative small and medium-sized enterprises;
and from 8 778 to 12 218 for venture companies.

A greater effort to develop human resources
From 2003 to 2009, the government formulated and
implemented major policies to support the development
of basic science and human resources. The government is
well aware that creativity is the foundation of innovation
and will be essential if the country’s efforts to develop
endogenous innovation capabilities in the midst of global
competition are to succeed. These policies include the
Strategy to Develop Human Resources in Science and
Technology, the Medium and Long-term Supply and
Demand Forecast for Human Resources in Science and
Technology (2006–2010), the second Brain Korea 21
project (Box 2) and the Measures to Increase the Number
of Civil Servants Specialized in Science and Engineering.
Over the same period, the government introduced a
number of programmes and raised the budget in all areas
of S&T human resource development, including
programmes for both young people and retired scientists
and engineers (Table 4).

UNESCO SCIENCE REPORT 2010

Box 1: Preparing for the future with innovation

From 2003 to 2007, the government
developed and supported 10 major
next-generation growth engine
programmes in S&T to prepare the
national economy for the future. 
This research has resulted in a total 
of 136 achievements, including:

■ The first wireless broadband

(WiBro) technology in the world.
WiBro was developed by the
Korean telecommunications
industry; 

■ An active-matrix organic light-
emitting diode (AM-OLED) for
large televisions;

■ A digital multimedia broadcasting
(DMB) transmission and reception
system. DMB is a digital radio
transmission technology
developed by Korea as part of 
the national IT project to send

multimedia, such as television,
radio and datacasting, to mobile
devices like mobile phones;

■ 521M PRAM (Parameter RAM). 

The government also launched large-
scale national R&D programmes to
support the commercialization of
major research results, such as the
magnetic levitation train, a treatment
for encephalopathic dementia and
digital actor and large-sized wing-in-
ground-effect (WIG) craft. 

In addition, the advancement of
existing key industries has produced
visible results. For example, thanks to
support for the components and
materials industry, including the
establishment of the Korea Materials
and Components Industry Agency in
2005, profits from international trade
in this sector have skyrocketed:

from US$ 2.9 billion in 2002 to 
US$ 34.7 billion in 2006. This said,
the trading deficit with Japan in
components and materials widened
over the same period from
US$ 1.8 billion to US$ 15.6 billion.
However, the ratio of technology
trade revenue to expenditure is
improving. It rose from 0.23 % in 2002
to 0.42% in 2007, thanks to growth in
technology exports. According to a
report by the Ministry of Commerce,
Industry and Energy (MoCIE), now
MKE, Korea was 9th in the world for
the export volume of cutting-edge
technological products in 2003 but
had climbed to 7th position by 2006.
Korea is also making a greater number
of the world’s best-quality products
than before, up from 122 in 2002 to
308 in 2006, according to MoCIE. 
Source: MoCIE, January 2010

As a result of these efforts, the human resource base for
research expanded during 2003–2008. The total number 
of researchers grew to 300 050 by the end of 
2008, which is equivalent to 97 researchers for every 
10 000 Koreans. Furthermore, in order to encourage
research productivity, the remuneration system for
researchers has improved, including an increase in
remuneration to 50% of revenue generated from
technology fees. A policy has also been introduced to raise
KRW 200 billion (US$ 150 million) for the Korean Scientists
and Engineers Mutual Aid Association by 2012. Another
policy shortens the compulsory period of employment for
specialized research staff – who are already exempted from
military service – from four to three years, in order to
promote a more stable and research-friendly environment.

Ensuring a better quality of life through S&T
From 2003 to 2009, the government also implemented
R&D policies to promote a better quality of life, in a
departure from the previous growth-oriented policies. 
It identified 22 priority areas and introduced policy
documents entitled Means of Technology-based
Enhancement of the Quality of Life for the Realization of 

Vision 2030 (NSTC, 2007a) and Comprehensive Means of
Technology-based Improvement of the Quality of Life
(NSTC, 2007b). In addition, Plans for the Pursuit of
Transforming Transdepartmental R&D into Wonder 
Drugs were adopted for a healthier life through the
development of biotechnology and medical technology.
In parallel, investment in these areas was expanded. 

In order to improve health care and medical services, the
government introduced the Law on the Development of
Oriental Medicine and the Law on Cancer Management in
2003 and established the Korea Centre for Disease Control
and Prevention. As implementation of all these policies
and initiatives requires substantial funding, the
government increased investment in areas related to
technology-based life improvement to KRW 385.3 billion
(US$ 290 million) in 2007, a 3.5 increase over 2003.

At the same time, different ministries began a concerted
effort to tackle other societal issues. These measures
included the enactment of the Basic Law on Low Birth
Rates and an Ageing Society (2005). In addition, 
the government introduced measures to ensure safety

Box 2: Brain Korea 21 

The first Brain Korea 21 project got
under way in 1999. The aim was to
prepare higher education for the
realities of the 21st century. The
government invested KRW 1.4 trillion
(about US$ 1.2 billion) over seven
years to develop world-class
research universities and graduate
schools. About three-quarters of this
amount was earmarked for
developing graduate schools in
natural and applied sciences and in
social and human sciences.

The second Brain Korea 21 project
took over in 2006 and has pursued
the goals of its predecessor with a
budget of KRW 2.1 trillion (about 
US$ 1.8 billion) over seven years.  
In order to qualify for the pro -
gramme and thereby receive
government funding, universities
are obliged to organize them -
selves into research consortia
made up of university staff and to
collaborate on specific projects.
Extremely ambitious, the project

has shifted the government focus
from undergraduate to graduate
education. Whereas some criticize
this move for abandoning the
principle of equal opportunity, others
praise it for the focus on nurturing
world-class research and for
encouraging students to pursue
graduate education.

The project is due to wind up in

2012.

from atomic power and radioactive waste materials. 
For example, in 2005, the location of a radioactive waste
treatment plant was chosen with the consent of the local
community. The Atomic Energy Act (2005) was also
amended to include a nuclear power plant safety
examination system. Furthermore, the government set up
a National Emergency Management Agency (2007) and
Social Safety Network Research Institute (2006) to cope
with disasters comprehensively .

The government has also strived to ensure safety and
reliability in the construction and transportation sectors,
as demonstrated by the development of the Korean tilting
train (2001–2007) and bullet train (2002–2007). The
government has also engaged in a variety of activities to
secure eco-friendly resources, such as drilling for gas
hydrates in 2007 in the East Sea, the fifth successful
attempt in the world. It is also participating in a project
within the International Partnership for the Hydrogen
Economy7 and developing core environmental
technologies. 

Under the new government, NSTC recommended to
President Lee in January 2009 that investment in public
welfare be expanded to cope with social and global issues
such as food safety, climate change, mad cow disease, avian
influenza and so on.

Measures for ensuring more balanced regional
development
Past policies designed to achieve rapid economic growth
have led to imbalanced regional development and
widened gaps between sectors. The government is now
assertively pursuing regional STI policies that are
expected to help correct these inequalities and ensure
balanced and sustainable regional development for the
future. These policies include the first five-year Plan for
Balanced Regional Development of the Nation (2004) and
the third five-year Plan for Promotion of Regional Science
and Technology (2007) covering the period 2008–2012.

A noticeable effect of this shift towards S&T policy for
regional development has been a substantial increase in
investment in regional R&D. The share of the government

budget for R&D (general accounting plus special
accounting) allocated to regions – excluding the Seoul
Metropolitan Area and the City of Daejeon – increased
from 27% in 2003 to 40% in 2008. Local governments
have also recognized the importance of S&T for the
development of their regions and carried investment in
this sector from 0.93% of their budget in 2002 to 2.3% 
in 2006. 

This surge in funding of regional R&D has led to 
an increase in regional innovation. The number of
technoparks, which totalled only eight in 2002, had
doubled to 16 by 2006. In addition, the Special Law on
Daedeok R&D Special Zone was enacted in July 2005 
to spur regional innovation. This law established a
comprehensive plan for the development of special 
R&D zones in November 2005 and promoted the 
Daedeok region as the site for research, development and
commercialization of new innovative products. As a result,
Daedok Innopolis has attracted foreign investment of 
US$ 13 million and 28 companies with an annual turnover
of more than KRW 10 billion (US$ 7 million). It has 
become an important site for technology transfer 
(600 cases as of March 2010) and for bringing innovation
to the marketplace (21 new innovative products).

More foreign R&D centres and stronger international
co–operation in S&T
While pursuing balanced regional development at home,
the government is also aiming to broaden the scope of
S&T policy and to strengthen national competitiveness in
the global economy. As part of this strategy, the
government is attempting to attract overseas research
centres to the country. To this end, it implemented the
Method of Consolidating Laws Related to Attracting
Overseas R&D Centres in March 2006. As a result, 
51 foreign R&D centres had been established on Korean
soil by the end of June 2007. 

Moreover, the Republic of Korea is now playing a greater
role in international S&T co-operation and participating in
various international projects to tackle global issues. 
These projects include the International Thermonuclear
Experimental Reactor (see page 158), the European Union’s
Galileo satellite navigation system and the Global
Research Laboratory (Box 3). The Republic of Korea is also
seeking to participate in the EU’s Seventh Framework
Programme for Research and Technological Development
(FP7).

Korea chapter [2] [Ed2]:Layout 1  27/1/11  10:25  Page 425

Republic of Korea

The government is promoting the participation of
companies in the EU Framework Programme and
supporting public R&D funding (about KRW 20 million per
company annually) for these companies. In 2009, the
government was planning to spend a total of KRW 
2.6 billion to support companies’ participation in FP7.

Encouraging people to participate in S&T
development
Fostering an ethical approach to research
For the government, social responsibility and ethical
awareness are important issues for scientists and engineers.
It has introduced the Scientist and Engineer’s Charter (2004)
and the Scientist and Engineer’s Code of Ethics (2007).
Furthermore, it has reinforced internal monitoring of how
research funds are being used, set up the Cyber Report
Centre for Execution of the Research Budget (2005) and
introduced the Research Budget Management Certification
System (2005) to foster greater transparency in the
allocation and utilization of research budgets.

By October 2007, a total of 113 research organizations had
implemented the government’s Guidelines for Securing
Research Ethics and supported the establishment of a self-
examination system for verifying the truthfulness of research. 

Moreover, the government is analysing the effect of new
technologies on society, culture, ethics and the
environment. In order to be able to deal with these effects
appropriately, it was conducting an Evaluation of
Technological Influence resulting from the development of
new technologies in 2010. These new technologies include
nanotechnology, biotechnology, information technology
(IT), convergence technologies and ubiquitous computing
technologies that have substantial social ripple effects.

Developing an S&T culture
In building a society based on principle and trust, 
it is important to ensure that practices are ethical. 
This holds true for the S&T sector as well. That is why 
the government is attempting to increase people’s
understanding of, and support for, S&T and to promote
popular participation in their development.

In 2003, the government implemented a five-year plan to
bring S&T and culture closer together. It launched the
Science Korea initiative in 2004 to build a national
consensus on how S&T should develop and to integrate
science into daily life. This includes stimulating interest 
in science and engineering among young people and
popularizing scientific topics. 

Box 3: The Global Research Laboratory

The Global Research Laboratory
programme was launched by the Korea
Foundation for International
Cooperation in Science and Technology
(KICOS) in 2006. It develops original core
technologies to solve global problems
through international collaborative
research between Korean and foreign
laboratories. One advantage of the
programme is that it makes it possible
to share research results from large-
scale projects and pool resources,
thereby reducing the cost of research.  

In 2007, a total of 16 areas were

being supported:
■ Stem cell applications; 
■ Early diagnosis of cancer; 
■ Environmental conservation and

restoration; 

■ Gene therapy; 
■ Nano-based materials; 
■ IT nanodevices; 
■ Bio-information application

technology; 

■ Environmentally friendly nano-

materials; 

■ Nano-level materials processing; 
■ New and renewable energy; 
■ Prevention of, and response to,

natural disasters; 

■ Bio-immune protection and
infectious diseases control; 

■ Nano-bio materials; 
■ Next-generation display technology; 
■ Biochip Sensor technology; 
■ Climate change projection and

responsive technologies for
environmental change.

The Global Research Laboratory
programme is supported by MEST 
and managed by the National
Research Foundation of Korea. Any
Korean research centre, laboratory,
research group, organization or
institution may apply for the programme,
in line with Article 7 of the Technology
Development Promotion Law. Project
proposals must be presented jointly by
the Korean and foreign research
laboratory to a review committee that
includes foreign members.

UNESCO SCIENCE REPORT 2010

The government is relying on the media and other means
to build an S&T culture. For example, it provides science
programmes like Science Café, broadcast by KBS, Korea’s
premier public broadcaster and the biggest Korean
television network with an audience rating of more than
7%. Another science programme is Science TV, which was
broadcast throughout the country in September 2007. 
A third example is Brain Power Plant Q, 
a programme aired by the Munhwa Broadcasting
Corporation, one of the four major national Korean
television and radio networks. On the Internet, the
government has posted Science All, a scientific literary
portal, since 2005 and has been publishing the science
news bulletin Science Times regularly since 2003.

In addition, the government disseminates information on
S&T policy through its Science and Technology Innovation
Newsletter and provides an opportunity to share scientific
knowledge through the weekly science lecture programme
Science Touch. Research achievements are also disseminated
through exhibitions like that on research performance and
future economic growth. Other initiatives include the
Science for Leaders and the Science and Technology
Ambassador programmes to increase awareness among
leaders from various sectors of society of the importance of
S&T and to stimulate their interest. As a result of these efforts,
the level of interest among Koreans in new scientific
discoveries has improved considerably (Figure 4). 

POSITIVE TRENDS AND OUTCOMES

Rapid growth in private sector investment in S&T
One of the government’s major achievements during
2003–2008 was the introduction of measures establishing
a firm foundation for the enhancement of R&D and
economic performance to drive future growth. 

The government increased the share of the budget it
allocated to R&D and encouraged the private sector to do
likewise. From 2003 to 2008, the combined R&D budget of
the government and private sector increased at an
average annual rate of 12.6 %. Private sector investment
alone grew by 12.3% during this period, a rate which far
exceeds that of some very advanced countries: USA, Japan
and Germany could all boast of growth of around 5%. In
addition, the Korean GERD/GDP ratio, or R&D intensity,
climbed from 2.63% in 2003 to 3.37% in 2008, placing the
country fourth among OECD members for this indicator.

Greater support for basic research and innovation 
With greater R&D investment has come greater support
for basic research, creating a better basis for independent
innovation. Government investment in basic research
increased from 19.5% of the budget in 2003 to 23.1% in
2006 then to 25.6% in 2008. In monetary terms, however,
the budget for basic research almost doubled in five years,
from KRW 2.76 trillion (US$ 2.1 billion) in 2003 to 
KRW 5.54 trillion (US$ 4.2 billion) in 2008, reflecting the
determination of the government and private sector to
develop basic research (Figure 5).

Greater R&D investment by small and medium-sized
venture enterprises
During 2003–2009, the government continued to
promote balanced growth for both large corporations and
small and medium-sized venture enterprises, together
with encouraging innovation in the private sector. This
differs from past administrations which had tended to
concentrate more on large corporations. As a result,
investment in R&D by small and medium-sized venture
enterprises has started to grow again after contracting in
2000 due to the collapse of the IT venture bubble 
(Figure 6). The manufacturing industry is also showing
healthy growth: the ratio of R&D investment to sales has
grown from 2.19% in 2002 to 2.76% in 2008 (Table 4).

A steep climb in the number of researchers
Besides greater investment in R&D, another major trend
in S&T has been the significant increase in the number 
of researchers. Their ranks grew at an annual average rate
of 8.7% from 2003 to 2008. As a result, there are now 
300 050 researchers, placing the Republic of Korea fifth
worldwide. As for the number of researchers in relation 
to population size, there were 97 full-time equivalent
(FTE) researchers per 10 000 population in 2008,
compared to 66 in 2003. The number of FTE researchers
relative to active researchers also increased substantially
over the same period. However, the Republic of Korea still
trails the USA, China, Japan and Germany in terms of
overall numbers (Figure 7). 

A stronger patent performance and productivity
The number of registered patents is a key indicator of
innovation. From 2003 to 2007, the volume of Korean
patents increased substantially, largely due to greater and
more effective investment in R&D over this period and
government efforts to stimulate innovation. The number
of patents registered by Koreans in the USA increased by
99.4% from 3 786 in 2003 to 7 549 in 2008 – ranking the
Republic of Korea fourth worldwide for this indicator.

As for domestic patents, their number grew from 
45 298 in 2002 to 123 705 in 2007 (Figure 8). These
positive trends in patent performance suggest that
increases in R&D investment from 2003 onwards started
producing results as early as 2005.

Moreover, the number of Korean patents belonging to the
Triadic patent families, which are registered in the patent
offices of the USA, Japan and EU, grew approximatively by
a factor of 2.3 from 2002 to 2005, increasing from 1 383 to
3 158 respectively. Also, the number of Triadic patent family

patents per KRW 1 billion of research budget funding
increased from 0.08 in 2002 to 0.13 in 2005 (Figure 9). 

A healthier technology trade balance
During 2003–2007, technology trade volumes increased
markedly. This suggests that innovation has become more
intensive in the Republic of Korea in recent years and
technology trade with other countries more active. The
technology trade volume amounted to US$ 4.05 billion in
2003 and by 2007 had almost doubled (growing by 80%) to
US$ 7.28 billion (Figure 10).

In addition, the ratio of technology trade revenue to
expenditure, calculated as the ratio of technology exports
to technology imports, increased from 0.25% in 2003 to
0.43% in 2007, indicating that conditions for technology
trade have improved substantially in the Republic of
Korea. However, judging from 2007 figures, this ratio is still
very low compared to such advanced countries as Japan
(3.49), UK (1.90), USA (1.75), Sweden (1.51), Finland (0.69)
and Germany (1.11). 

More articles in SCI journals
The number of articles in Science Citation Index (SCI)
journals is a commonly used indicator to measure R&D
performance at the national level. The number of Korean
articles almost doubled between 2003 and 2008 from 
18 830 to 35 569 (Figure 11). In addition, the number of
Korean articles in SCI journals per 100 researchers has gone
up to nine since 2003, indicating that research efficiency has
improved overall.

Furthermore, the distribution of Korean articles in SCI
journals shows a heavy focus on the physical sciences and
engineering, with far fewer publications in life sciences
than in other dynamic countries for research (OECD, 2009).
Figure 12 suggests this might be changing, albeit slowly.
In terms of volume and world share, Korea performs best
in clinical medicine and material sciences respectively
(Figure 13). 

Improved competitiveness in S&T
The results of a comprehensive evaluation carried out by
the Institute of Management Development (IMD) in
Switzerland of national competitiveness in S&T for various
countries show that the competitiveness of the Republic
of Korea in S&T has taken off since 2003 (IMD, 2009). The
country’s scientific competitiveness climbed from 13th
place worldwide in 2005 to 3rd place in 2009.

In terms of technological competitiveness, however, the
Republic of Korea has taken the opposite path, slipping
from 2nd place overall (2005) to 14th (2009) [Figure 14]. 
This is due to a poor showing for some key indicators. For
example, in terms of the extent to which the development
and application of technology are supported by the legal
environment, the Republic of Korea ranks only 37th and for
technological co-operation between companies 38th. 
It can only manage 36th place for the extent to which
technological regulation supports business development
and innovation and 34th for the funding of technological
development. Other indicators taken into account in the
overall evaluation include whether cyber security is being
adequately addressed by corporations (38th) and the
percentage of mobile telephone subscribers in the
general population (38th) [IMD, 2009]. In Japan, scientific
competitiveness may have managed to hold on to 
3rd place since 2009 but the country’s technological
competitiveness has slipped from 9th place (2005) to 
16th place (2009), owing to the recent economic recession
in Japan.

CONCLUSION

The Republic of Korea has performed exceptionally well in
the past few decades in its efforts to catch up to the
world’s leading economies, instigating waves of industrial
upgrades to become a world leader in some of the most
high-tech industries (OECD, 2009). More than 80% of
GERD has gone on research applications and develop-
ment. Of this share, 50% has fuelled economic
development with a focus on industrial technology.

Despite the global economic recession caused by the 
US subprime mortgage crisis, the Korean economy
expanded by 1.2% in 2009 and is projected to grow 
4.4 % this year (OECD, 2009). The Republic of Korea 
owes much of its success to high levels of both total
expenditure on R&D and business expenditure on R&D, 
a highly educated labour force, strong infrastructure in
ICTs and the development of substantial technological
capabilities in a number of high-tech areas.8

8. Korean firms recently conquered the highest world market share in three
areas: DRAM semiconductors, a memory product commonly used in personal
computers; liquid crystal display (LCD) computer monitors and televisions to
which thin-film transistors (TFT) are added; and CDMA cellular phones.

Republic of Korea

However, the Republic of Korea is now entering a critical
phase in its development with few guarantees of continuing
success. It is reaching the limits of its catch-up strategy due
to the difficulties of creating a new growth engine, its
continuing deficit in the technological balance of payments
and a lack of national R&D investment in preparedness for
natural and human-induced disasters and in global issues
like climate change. 

To overcome these limitations, the Republic of Korea’s STI
strategy needs to shift from a ‘catch-up’ model to a ‘post
catch-up’ model incorporating such features as a ‘creative
mode’ and ‘green growth mode’ , among others. Future
investment in R&D should be expanded in the areas of
basic research and green technology to enable research to
focus more on frontier research and take a greener path,
raise the innovative and absorptive capacities of small and
medium-sized enterprises and link up researchers better to
international sources of knowledge (OECD, 2009). The
Republic of Korea needs to expand R&D investment in
socially responsible technology in such areas as disaster
prevention, food safety and mitigation and adaptation to
climate change.

It will also be necessary to boost R&D investment in the
university sector. Universities are the key performers of
basic research and concentrate high-quality human
capital. Korean STI policy needs to nurture and utilize its
world-class human resources and to strengthen global
S&T co-operation.

INTRODUCTION

The present chapter covers a wide diversity of economies in
Southeast Asia, Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific
Islands.1 Of the seven countries grouped under Southeast
Asia, one is the world’s fifth-largest exporter of merchandise,
newly industrialized Singapore. At the other end of the
scale, Cambodia ranks 111th for world merchandise exports,
whereas Timor Leste does not even feature in the global
statistics of the World Trade Organization (WTO). 

The total population of the seven Southeast Asian
countries plus Australia and New Zealand came to 
549 million in 2009. The total GDP for this group in 
2008 amounted to US$ 2 475 million, just over half that 
of China (US$ 4 327 million) and twice that of India 
(US$ 1 213 million). The developed industrial economies 
of Australia and New Zealand account for only 5% of the
population but nearly half of the group’s total GDP.  

motion as a consequence served to cushion many
economies from the impact of the global recession a
decade later, compared to what North America and
Western Europe have been going through. Moreover, in
most of the countries covered here, science remains a
comparatively low priority in national strategic plans, as we
shall see in the country profiles that follow for Cambodia,
Thailand and Fiji in particular. As a consequence, the global
recession has had very little direct impact on science. 

Nevertheless, the impact can be observed through: (a) a
reduction in high-tech exports; (b) more sharply defined
science priorities aligned with local national priorities in
Australia, New Zealand and Singapore; and in some cases
(c) reduced spending on science and technology (S&T).
This latter impact is not yet clearly documented because
of the time lag in data availability on expenditure on
research and development (R&D) but the issue has been
foreshadowed in some national policy statements.

The present chapter also encompasses 22 Pacific Island
countries and territories, although, in terms of science,
these are dominated by ‘the big four’: Fiji, Papua New
Guinea, New Caledonia and French Polynesia. These
economies are nevertheless small in size and in terms of
their contribution to world trade. 

The stories that will unfold in the following pages are as
diverse as the countries themselves. There is no one single
story that epitomizes the region as a whole, or even sub-
regions. There are, however, some common trends in terms
of the general direction science policy is taking, the mobility
of human resources and international collaboration.

The global recession triggered by the US subprime crisis in
2008 has been experienced differently from one country to
another. Australia, for example, was one of the few countries
of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD) that technically avoided a recession.
This was largely because of the comparatively sound financial
structures in the economy and the continued high demand
for commodities from China and India. A strong economic
stimulus programme was introduced by the Australian
government in 2009 but this focused on infrastructure
projects with little or no direct implications for science.

Firstly, all countries are dependent to some degree on the
science systems of the global scientific Triad: USA, Europe
and Japan. This is evident in world output of scientific
papers, patents and other related intellectual property,
foreign investment and technological innovation and
research training. 

Secondly, the global mobility of, and competition for,
scientists and engineers have intensified. All countries are
seeking to train, attract and retain an increasing cohort of
scientists and engineers.

The earlier Asian financial crisis from 1997 to 1999 had
reverberated around Southeast Asia, leading to a number
of structural and institutional reforms in national financial
systems. Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand and Malaysia
were all hard-hit by the Asian crisis but reforms set in

1. The present chapter includes the seven Southeast Asian countries of
Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Viet
Nam, as well as Australia and New Zealand, plus the 22 Pacific Island
countries and territories dominated by Fiji, Papua New Guinea, New
Caledonia and French Polynesia.

Thirdly, international collaboration in S&T is growing
rapidly, partly due to liberalized political arrangements
and partly due to the growing cost of much scientific
infrastructure. 

Fourthly, science policy has shifted ground in terms of
national development strategies. Science policy has been
brought in from the cold to play a central role in innovation
policies. This has quite significant long-term implications
and carries with it policy management dilemmas.

UNESCO SCIENCE REPORT 2010

The responsibility for a science, technology and innovation
(STI) system draws on a wider range of government
portfolios than previously, whereas science has usually
remained the responsibility of one, or perhaps two,
ministries. With innovation touching on the responsibilities
of a much wider range of portfolios, co-ordination becomes
a key factor. An accompanying challenge is thus to maintain
a strong, competitive basic science system in the context of
the sometimes competing policy demands that emerge. 

Last but not least, globalization offers both opportunities
and challenges for some of the smaller economies. 
Global competition has drawn groups of countries into
collaborating networks. Thus, regional structures2 such as
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), the Pacific
Islands Forum and the Greater Mekong Subregion offer
new opportunities for coalescing scientific capacity.

2. See Annex I for the composition of ASEAN, APEC, the Pacific Islands
Forum and Greater Mekong Region

These issues are discussed below in the context of five
structural factors: (i) research and development (R&D)
input (ii) R&D output and, in the country profiles (iii)
institutional arrangements (iv) policies and priorities and
(v) future trends and challenges.

R&D INPUT
Trends in R&D expenditure and personnel
The available data for all countries show rising national
investment in R&D. Singapore and Australia more than
doubled spending between 2000 and 2006. However, when
gross domestic expenditure on R&D (GERD) is configured as
a percentage of GDP, it becomes clear that, for Thailand, the
Philippines and Indonesia, among others, these investments
have barely kept pace with growth in GDP (Table 1). 

Of all the countries covered in the present chapter,
Singapore stands out as the most rapidly growing science
investor. In Singapore, GERD doubled between 2000 and
2007, progressing from 1.9% to 2.5% of GDP.

Note: Developed by the World Bank, the Knowledge Eonomy Index (KEI) is based on the average of the normalised scores of a country for all four pillars of the
knowledge economy: economic incentive and institutional regime; education; innovation and ICTs. The Knowledge Index (KI) measures a country’s ability to
generate, adopt and use knowledge. The KI index is based on key variables for the three knowledge pillars: education, innovation and ICTs. It should be noted
that some data are missing for Viet Nam.

Source: World Bank database, accessed March 2010

GERD per capita also doubled to US$ 1 342, a figure
considerably higher than that for Japan (US$ 1 159), the
USA (US$ 1 195) or the UK (US$ 620). Singapore also
stands out for the four groups of variables used by the
World Bank to construct its Knowledge Economy Index
(KEI): economic incentive, innovation, education and
information and communication technologies (ICTs)
[Table 2]. Yet, even Singapore has struggled to move up
the ladder: in 2009, it ranked 19th out of 146 economies on
the KEI, having climbed just two rungs since 1995.
Nevertheless, the dynamic rise of Singapore is one of the
outstanding developments of the past five years.

The number of S&T personnel has also grown
considerably across the region. Again, Singapore leads in
terms of growth. However, Singapore still has a
comparatively small pool of technicians, suggesting
future skills shortages if the current pace of scientific
growth continues unabated. In Indonesia, numbers of S&T
personnel appear to have declined, although it should
be noted that the available data are not directly
comparable. Meanwhile, data on investment in R&D and
S&T personnel are few and far between for many of the
Pacific countries and Timor Leste.

An important indicator of national capability in STI is the
level of business sector investment in R&D. These data are

highly variable across the countries covered here. 
For example, Malaysia and the Philippines both have
comparatively high rates of business investment in R&D.
However, this is largely because of the presence of large
foreign firms operating in those countries. There is
evidence that similar developments are underway in
Thailand. The challenges for the STI systems of these
countries will be to lever knowledge and technology from
this foreign investment for their domestic economies.

Cambodia and Timor Leste have been undergoing
considerable social and economic transformation. As a
consequence, investment in S&T has focused primarily on
institution-building and on developing human resources.
The tragedy of Cambodia’s turmoil throughout the 1970s
is reflected in a miniscule human resource base compared
to its neighbours. Also undergoing economic transition,
Viet Nam has been developing from a low base but S&T
institutional structures are comparatively well-developed
and, although undergoing widespread reform, provide a
strong historical foundation on which to build. 

Two important observations can be made from these
indicators. The first is that there is considerable diversity
across the region in terms of human resources and
expenditure on S&T. The second observation concerns the
rapid, meteoric rise of Singapore’s scientific capacity.

UNESCO SCIENCE REPORT 2010

Singapore is one of the few countries in the region with a
net inflow of scientific personnel, both from the region
and from other scientifically advanced economies. There is
growing evidence that Singapore is becoming central to
global knowledge hubs in fields such as biomedical
science and information technology (IT). A big challenge
for Singapore will be to maintain the present inflow of
human capital in order to underpin sustained knowledge-
based development over the next decade, even as the
rapid growth of the Indian and Chinese economies is
stimulating demand for skilled personnel in these
countries. However, it can be safely said that the growing
presence of Singapore in global science is not simply a
localized phenomenon but also carries wider implications
for scientific collaboration across regional economies.

Information infrastructure: reaching the poor
One issue confronting most countries concerns their capacity
to deliver benefits from science to the rural poor who live
outside the major cities. According to the World Bank’s ICT
variable, Singapore performs best in Southeast Asia, no
doubt due in part to being essentially an urban country. 

Singapore, Australia and New Zealand have all massively
expanded Internet access since 2001 (Figure 1). What is
striking is the difficulty countries with a large, urban poor
face in spreading access to the Internet, such as Cambodia,
the Philippines and Timor Leste. Interestingly, the French-
speaking Pacific territories have developed Internet usage
quite rapidly since 2000, no doubt due to their ties to
metropolitan France.

R&D OUTPUT

Scientific publications  
The number of scientific publications has grown
substantially in the region, increasing by around 70% from
1998 to 2008, with Australia, Singapore and New Zealand
being the largest knowledge producers (Table 3). For
many countries, publications grew from a very low
starting point but some quickly overcame this handicap,
including Thailand and Malaysia. In 2001, Singapore even
overtook New Zealand, a country with a similar
population, and has since consolidated its position.

‘The big four’ dominated the scientific output of the
Pacific over the same ten-year period: New Caledonia,
Papua New Guinea, Fiji and French Polynesia. These four
accounted for 86% of articles published by scientists in
the Pacific islands that were recorded in Thomson Reuters’
Science Citation Index (Table 4). Overall, the Pacific
countries and territories account for less than 1% of all the
scientific articles produced by the countries covered in the
present chapter.

These data raise the question of just how central the three
major science publishing countries of Australia, Singapore

and New Zealand are to scientific collaboration? Do
regional knowledge hubs really pivot around these
countries or is each of the three simply pursuing its own
separate scientific endeavour? In the answer lies the key
to understanding the dynamics of regional co-operation
in S&T.

It is possible to explore this question by investigating
patterns of co-authorship (Table 5). Co-authorship data
tell an interesting story. Firstly, it is clear that
international co-authorship of scientific papers is a
commonplace practice for scientists right across the
region. Secondly, the rate of international co-authorship
is significantly higher among those countries that
produce a modest amount of scientific papers. The level
of international co-authorship for specific countries may
thus provide an indicator of international scientific
dependence. Cambodia, for example, has been almost
entirely dependent on international co-authorship for its
publication output for the past decade (94%). Scientists
in Indonesia and the Philippines also have relatively high
rates of co-publication with international colleagues.
Singapore, Australia, New Zealand and Malaysia are, by
contrast, far less dependent on co-authors abroad for
their publication output and there is evidence of

considerable collaboration between countries in the
region. International comparisons suggest that a figure
of around 40–50% for international co-authorship
represents a good balance between the national science
base and global collaborative science. 

Although scientists from the USA are the most
prominent collaborators overall, there is some diversity
in international co-authorship. Among the Pacific
nations and territories, Australia and France are the
dominant partners, with the French connection logically
being strongest for the French-speaking territories. There
is also co-operation among Pacific countries and
territories. For example, over 10% of Fiji’s international
co-authored publications include at least one author
from another Pacific country. The same is true for French
Polynesia and New Caledonia. This is an important
development for the smaller Pacific States and territories
because co-authorship with the larger Pacific economies
indicates not only co-operation in common areas of
scientific endeavour but also potential knowledge
conduits to major global science hubs elsewhere. The US
scientific hub is the most frequent source of co-authors
for most Southeast Asian countries, Australia and New
Zealand. However, Indonesian and Vietnamese scientists
co-author articles primarily with their Japanese

counterparts and Malaysian authors with Chinese
scientists. China is also an important collaborator for
scientists from Singapore, the Philippines and Australia,
an interesting addition to the scientific domination
generally accorded to the USA, Japan and the European
Union (EU).

National strengths in particular fields emerge when
publications are counted by field of research (Figure 2).
For the region as a whole, clinical medicine
predominates (30% of all publications), followed by
biological (15%), engineering (15%) and biomedical
sciences (13%). In some countries, scientific output is
concentrated in one or two fields. For example, more
than half of Cambodia’s modest output is circumscribed
to the medical sciences. Interestingly, Earth and space
sciences also make up a sizeable share of its research
output. By contrast, output from Singapore emanates
firstly from engineering, followed by medicine and
physics. Fiji, Indonesia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea
and the Philippines all have a high output in biological
sciences. Malaysia stands apart, with its strong focus on
chemistry. 

There is also evidence of the growing impact of the
science produced in the region. One indicator of scientific

impact is the level of citation of scientific papers (Table 6).
Most of the larger science systems in the region were
achieving average citations per paper that were relatively
close to the overall average number of citations for all
papers from all countries (10.51 citations per paper).
Citations per paper also appear to be on an upward trend
for the developing economies in the region. 

A higher than average citation rate for papers from a
particular country in a given field can be considered an
indicator of scientific impact. For example, Australian
papers were more highly cited than the overall average in
16 out of 22 broad scientific field for the period 1999–2009,
with New Zealand (10 fields) and Singapore (8 fields) also
showing clear evidence of achieving above-average
impact across a spectrum of sciences. However, some of
the smaller science systems from the region also achieved
above-average impact in specific fields, including: the
Philippines (computer science, environment/ecology,
pharmacology and toxicology, plant and animal science);
Viet Nam (clinical medicine, microbiology, neuroscience);
Indonesia (geosciences, social sciences); Papua New
Guinea (biology, microbiology) and New Caledonia
(geosciences). These apparent strengths are discussed in
the country profiles that follow, along with national
priorities for science and national policy directions.

Patents
One regional feature is the trend towards integrating S&T
policies with innovation and industry policies, notably
through the registration of patents. Through the period
2000–2007, the number of patents held in the USA and
registered by the Southeast Asian countries, Australia or
New Zealand nearly doubled (Table 7). Australia and New
Zealand were the two largest patent-registering countries
and Malaysia was the fastest-growing patent producer,
although from a smaller base. Malaysia registered half as
many patents as New Zealand in 2001 but matched it by
2006 and moved ahead in 2007.

Southeast Asia and Oceania

High-tech exports
Despite the global recession, a number of Southeast Asian
economies have performed well in high-tech
manufactured exports and commodities in particular
(Figure 3). High-tech manufacturing is drawn mainly from
Sections 5 and 7 of the Standard International Trade
Classification. Within Section 7, the major high-tech
products are electronics, electrical and related data
equipment but also some power-generating equipment

and medical devices. Section 5 includes medical and
pharmaceutical products, optical equipment, aeronautics,
photographic equipment and metrological devices (Lall,
2000). Where the available data are recent enough,
growth in some of these high-tech exports appears to
have slowed or even declined as a result of the global
recession. However, a closer analysis shows that the
decline has been progressing since 2000, suggesting a
lead up to the recession rather than a direct consequence.

UNESCO SCIENCE REPORT 2010

Malaysia’s exports of machinery and transport equipment
(Section 7), the largest commodity group (33.2% of
exports), actually dropped by 23.6% in 2007–2008,
mainly due to a fall in exports of electronic integrated
circuits. This sub-group collapsed by 75% from 2007 to
2008 but was generally flat through 2000–2008. Other
major high-tech exports from Malaysia for 2007 include
automatic data processing equipment (7.2% of total
exports) and office and data processing machine parts
(5.5%).

Major high-tech exports from the Philippines dropped
40% between 2006 and 2007. For the latter year,
electronic integrated circuits comprised 11.0% of total
exports and automatic data processing machines 7.8%.

Exports of machinery and transport equipment
constituted the majority (54.8%) of Singapore’s exports in
2007. High-tech manufacturing featured strongly in
Singapore’s export performance, including electronic
integrated circuits (21.1% of total exports) and automatic
data processing equipment (3.4%). Over the period
2003–2007, Section 7 exports averaged a growth rate of
13.8% but this fell to 4.7% for 2006–2007. Although
exports of electronic circuits slowed, they still reflected a
positive trend. 

Like Malaysia, Thailand performed well in high-tech
exports of automatic data processing equipment 
(8.2% of total exports in 2006–2007) and electronic
integrated circuits (5.3%) over the same period. 
For Thailand, machinery and transport equipment
represented nearly half (44.8%) of total exports. For this
section, Thailand has maintained an annual growth rate
of 18.3% for several years, with a slight dip in 2006–2007
to 17.9%.

It is likely that, when data emerge for 2009 and 2010, they
will reveal evidence of a decline in high-tech exports but
it is also likely that some countries in the region will fare
worse than others. As recovery deepens, economies such
as Singapore and Thailand will probably recover more
quickly than others, given the current trend.

COUNTRY PROFILES: 
Australia and New Zealand 

Australia
S&T and economic status 
Although it maintains a comparatively small population,
Australia ranks 23rd in terms of world trade merchandise
exports. GDP per capita amounted to US$ 48 253 in 2008.
Merchandise exports (US$ 187 million in 2009) were
dominated by fuel and mining (60%), with manufacturing
comprising just 16% and agriculture 14%. 

Australia has been undergoing somewhat of an STI policy
transition since 2005. Through the early 2000s, the economy
lagged behind other OECD countries in terms of the level of
investment in R&D. In 2000, GERD in Australia amounted to
just 1.61% of GDP, with business contributing just under half
(47.8%) of the total, according to the UNESCO Institute for
Statistics. With the exception of mining, business expenditure
on R&D remained well below the OECD average. Even
though GERD rose to 2.17% by 2006, driven largely by the
growing share (57.3%) invested by business in general and
mining in particular, the Australian economy still slipped
from 5th to 18th position in the World Economic Forum Index
from 2000 to 2008 (Cutler, 2008). This apparent slide in global
competitiveness in all but the natural resources sector
spurred the new government to undertake a series of
reforms in 2007. A number of reviews that directly or
indirectly focused on the national science system were
carried out between 2007 and 2010. These included reviews
of: the Australian innovation system; the higher education
system; the co-operative research centres programme; and a
series of sectoral reviews covering automobile production,
clothing and footwear, and pharmaceuticals. In all cases, the
recommendations made and the policies that have resulted
so far have sought to bring science more centrally into the
Australian innovation and industrial systems and to
overcome some of the structural weaknesses noted in recent
years, such as a general decline in public investment in
science. According to the Innovation Review, Australian
government support for science and innovation as a share of
GDP fell by approximately 25% from 1994 to 2007 (Cutler,
2008). 

Structural arrangements, priorities and policies
As a consequence of the recent reviews cited above and an
apparent commitment to strengthening the science base
underpinning the country’s innovation performance, seven

SE Asia+Oceania [12] [P3]:Layout 1  18/10/10  20:02  Page 447

priorities for innovation were identified in 2009 to
complement existing national research priorities. These
are not sectoral priorities but rather are directed towards
systemic reform of the innovation system. These priorities
are: 

improving research funding;
producing skilled researchers to undertake the
national research effort; 
securing value from commercialization and
development of ‘industries for the future’; 
disseminating new technologies, processes and ideas; 
enhancing collaboration within the research sector and
between researchers and industry; 
stimulating international collaboration in R&D;
involving the public and communities to work with
others in the innovation system to improve policy
development and service delivery. 

Within the university research system, there remains a set
of four overarching research priorities dating from 2002.
These are: 

an environmentally sustainable Australia; 
promoting and maintaining good health; 
frontier technologies for building and transforming
Australian industries; 
safeguarding Australia. 

These research priorities are not directly attributable to
specific fields of scientific enquiry but rather set out
generic targets for socio-economic development. Under
each broad heading, there are lists of more specific
research targets.

Australia’s business sector investment in R&D has
traditionally been weak and dominated by a small number
of large firms, particularly in mining. The recent growth in
business sector R&D shows promise but this has largely
been led by mining and energy, which accounted for 17.4%
of the total national R&D effort in 2007, up from 12.8% two
years earlier. The public sector remains the major performer
across most fields of research; it is responsible for nearly
100% of pure basic research and 94% of strategic basic
research. Around 94% of business sector investment is
either experimental development or applied research. 

Apart from universities, the Commonwealth Scientific and
Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) is by far the
biggest public sector performer of research. In 2009, 
it employed 6500 people at 50 sites across the country.

Southeast Asia and Oceania

CSIRO research priorities are driven by a set of flagship
programmes adopted in 2000:

energy transformed; 
food futures; 
climate adaptation; 
future manufacturing;
preventative health; 
wealth from oceans; 
minerals down under and; 
sustainable agriculture.  

These flagship priorities reflect the growing regional
concern with climate change and sustainable production.
Expenditure on the Commonwealth socio-economic
objective of the environment has been rising slowly over
the past decade, reaching 2.4% of all Commonwealth
research investment for 2007.

Future trends and challenges for Australia
The Australian government increased the science budget
by 5% over the previous year’s budget in 2008 and a
further increase of 25% was foreshadowed for the 2010
science and innovation budget. Among major initiatives,
the government has announced a ‘super science initiative’.
This AU$ 1 100 million initiative is directed towards key
enabling technologies: biotechnology, nanotechnology
and ICTs, as well as two other key areas: space science and
astronomy; and marine and climate science. This
investment is likely to direct the overall national R&D
effort further towards the development of environmental
technologies and management practices. 

The Australian Cooperative Research Centres Programme has
been a key feature of the national science system for nearly
two decades. Over AU$ 150 million of Commonwealth funds
are invested in the programme. Recent changes announced
by the government include a refocus on public good
research, which should again add further impetus to
environmental technologies and their management,
including alternative energy and water management. 

There are three key challenges confronting the Australian
system. The first concerns the comparatively weak and
narrowly focused business sector involvement in the
system. The challenge will be to draw smaller and
potentially innovative firms into the broader national
science and innovation system. Public sector investment
is critical for building a strong national basic science
capability but the recent trend toward contestable

UNESCO SCIENCE REPORT 2010

funding in a common arena for the academic and public
sector system has blurred the boundaries for the missions
of different science institutions. The Australian Institute of
Marine Science (AIMS), the Australian Nuclear Science and
Technology Organisation (ANSTO), the CSIRO and
universities are now in competition across many common
sources of funds. This is a product of the integration of
S&T policy with innovation policy. The challenge, however,
will be to ensure that the basic science base can remain as
broad as possible in order to sustain a strong, diverse and
sustainable science culture. Managing the sometimes
competing demands of science and the much broader
demands of innovation and industry policy will remain a
major structural challenge for policy advisors and
governments.

New Zealand
S&T and economic status
New Zealand ranks 63rd on the World Trade Organization
(WTO) world trade merchandise index. GDP per capita is
lower than in neighbouring Australia, at US$ 29 870. New
Zealand’s trade remains dominated by agricultural exports
(59%) and scientific output is strongly concentrated in the
biological and medical sciences (Figure 2). 

New Zealand, like Australia, has lagged behind most other
OECD countries in terms of the level of investment in R&D.
It was not until 2002 that the GERD/GDP ratio reached
1.2%. Moreover, the level of private sector R&D is lower
than for almost all other OECD countries. 

Structural arrangements, priorities and policies
In early 1990, New Zealand introduced a major
restructuring of its science system which is still valid today.
The new arrangement separated science policy
development, science funding and the production of
scientific output. A longer-term strategic view directed
towards ‘benefit’ to New Zealand was adopted and a rather
unique structure put in place establishing the government
as a ‘science purchaser’ (Cleland and Manly, 2007). The
Ministry of Research, Science and Technology (MoRST) is
still the main driver of science policy and the Foundation
for Research, Science and Technology is the major
purchaser of public-funded science. The Health Research
Council is the major purchaser of medical research.

Although science policy is aligned with innovation policy,
administration remains more discrete than in Australia.
However, there is a strong emphasis on ‘Transformational

448

Research, Science and Technology’ and on establishing
roadmaps for S&T investment. There are currently four
strategic priorities:

sharpening the agenda;
engaging the population with S&T;
improving business performance; and
building a world-class science system. 

Existing priorities in biological and medical research have
been maintained, with new sectoral areas targeted for
development through national roadmaps, including food
research, energy and biotechnology. Through 2008–2009,
transformational research focused on building a high-tech
platform for renewable energy. The Health Research
Council received a considerable increase in funding in the
2009 budget. 

Established in 1992, Crown Research Institutes (CRIs) are a
major feature of the New Zealand system. By 2004,
investment in CRIs had reached US$ 395 million, making
them the biggest national investment programme.
Although their structural arrangements are quite different
from the Cooperative Research Centres in Australia, they
represent a similar structural feature in the New Zealand
science system and provide a similar level of policy input. 

International linkages are a strategic priority for New
Zealand. These are enshrined in a number of agreements,
including the Energy Development in Island Nations
partnership with the USA and Iceland, and the Science
and Technology Cooperative Agreement with the EU. 

Future trends and challenges for New Zealand
New Zealand ranks just below Australia on the
Knowledge Economy Index (KEI) overall but higher for
the variable of economic incentive regime. Both countries
have policies in place to build closer alliances between
the research and business sectors. Both are also placing
greater emphasis on public good research, much of
which comes in response to environmental concerns. For
New Zealand, this is described as ‘eco-innovation’ that will
draw together government, industry and science (MoRST,
2009: 3)

A key challenge identified by the New Zealand
government is to ‘refocus’ the CRIs in order to deliver a
greater impact in tackling challenges New Zealand faces
for the future. This includes, building high-tech platforms
for renewable energy, food research and biotechnology.

COUNTRY PROFILES: Southeast Asia

Cambodia
S&T and economic status
Cambodia is still recovering from the trauma of the
international and civil wars that decimated the country’s
scientific capacity in the 1970s. The economy has grown
rapidly in the first decade of the 21st century, albeit from a
very low base. GDP per capita stood at US$ 769 in 2009,
placing Cambodia just ahead of Timor Leste for this
indicator. The country currently ranks 111th on the world
trade merchandise export index. Merchandise exports are
concentrated in manufacturing, primarily clothing. 

Although Cambodia has been progressing rapidly both
economically and socially, the country does not compare
well in terms of knowledge-based development. On the
World Bank Knowledge for Development Index for 2009,
the Cambodian economy still lags well behind all other
East Asian and Pacific countries. The country has fallen
further behind on the knowledge index with a ‘normalised
regional score’ of 2.8 in 1996 declining to 1.15 in 2009. This
is in spite of the presence of many other positive social
and economic indicators.

There is currently no competitive funding programme to
support scientific research, although proposals are in
place to establish a National Research Commission for
Education. Consequently, there are, as yet, no clearly
defined research priorities but, with renewed efforts to
establish a national science funding system, these are in
the process of being developed. Publications are growing
from a small base with output almost totally dependent
on international co-authorship. The USA, France and
Japan are the three main partner countries contributing
to this output. Output is almost entirely concentrated in
the life sciences, with three-quarters of publications
relating to the biological, biomedical or medical sciences
(Figure 2). Internet usage is in its infancy with just 0.5% of
the population having access (Figure 1).

Structural arrangements, priorities and policies
There is currently no overt national strategy for S&T. 
As a consequence, S&T policy remains fragmented and
dispersed across the various ministries responsible for
social and economic management and development.
There are, however, some nascent structures emerging
that could provide the basis for a national strategy.

Southeast Asia and Oceania

The supply of scientists and engineers has been growing
and there is potential for further development. Their
number remains limited, however, because of a
comparatively weak institutional capacity and a higher
education system that has grown faster than its capacity to
deliver quality control across a highly diverse range of
institutions proposing higher education. Responsibility for
university-based professional training rests with the
Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport and technical
training with the Ministry of Labour. As the higher
education system continues to grow, the country faces an
immediate, pressing challenge to co-ordinate institutional
strengths in order to entrench national quality and achieve
policy objectives across the entire higher education system.
As yet, there are no defined priorities for scientific research.

Cambodia’s private sector remains weak and very much
dependent on both foreign direct investment (FDI) and
overseas development aid (ODA). Consequently, it is the
public sector which shoulders most of the burden for
national investment in knowledge-based development,
including R&D. As the private sector becomes stronger and
more innovative, the policy challenge will be to find ways
to stimulate the development of R&D and innovation in
the private sector. While S&T is not specifically mentioned
in the country’s development plans, S&T issues are
directed to an ad hoc committee composed of
representatives from eight ministries and co-ordinated by
the Ministry of Industry, Mines and Energy. 

Future trends and challenges for Cambodia
The future challenges for Cambodia are immense, with
institutional and human resource-building a major priority.
At present, there are a number of internationally
supported initiatives underway to help the country
overcome institutional barriers. For example, the World
Bank is supporting an initiative with the Ministry of
Education, Youth and Sport to enhance the research
capacity of the higher education system, and the Asian
Development Bank is supporting the elaboration of a
‘technology adoption framework’ with the Ministry of
Industry, Mines and Energy. There are also plans to develop
the nation’s research funding system and reviews are
underway to revitalize science and engineering education.

The country is at an early stage of developing an industrial
private sector. FDI is being sought and will probably by
located in one or more of the 21 special economic zones
that have been proposed by the government.

UNESCO SCIENCE REPORT 2010

The growth areas at the moment are the garment,
tourism, construction and property development
industries. The growth in garment manufacturing is
related to the influx of FDI due to low labour costs. 

As S&T policy becomes more national in focus and is
directed towards the development of a national
innovation system, it will be necessary to monitor and
review national progress. At present, no single agency has
the mandate or the resources to evaluate S&T policy or
develop indicators for monitoring S&T and innovation. A
critical challenge will be to build some institutional
capacity to carry out this work and to resource periodic
data collection and analysis.

The global economic recession since 2008 threatens to
staunch the flow of international support. However, there
are promising signs for Cambodia in terms of natural oil
reserves. At present, agriculture and fuel comprise just 
5% of the country’s merchandise exports. The discovery 
of potentially lucrative oil reserves in recent years may
lead to growth in raw production but the capacity to
process the raw product onshore will depend upon the
availability of skilled personnel and funding for industrial
development.

Indonesia
S&T and economic status
Indonesia is the most populous country in Southeast Asia;
it also comprises 45% of the total population of the
countries studied here. Since the Asian financial crisis in
the late 1990s, the economy has struggled to recover. The
Indonesian economy is now well down on the World Bank
Knowledge Index scale, above only Cambodia. However,
due to the overall size of the economy, it ranks 31st in the
world merchandise trade value index. Manufacturing and
fuel (36%) and mining (38%) comprise the main
merchandise export category groups. GDP per capita in
2008 came to US$ 2 247. The GERD/GDP ratio has
languished, recording only 0.05% in 2005. It fares only
better than Cambodia and Viet Nam for the share of GERD
contributed by the private sector. 

In previous decades, Indonesia placed great emphasis on
building S&T institutions. Apart from the university sector
and departmental R&D organizations, there are currently
seven national R&D agencies (see next section). In 2005,
these seven agencies were working on a series of priority
programmes: food and agriculture, energy, defence,

450

transportation, ICTs, health and pharmaceuticals. 
With the onset of the global recession, the policy effort
has been directed toward sharpening the S&T investment
focus on those areas that have potential for economic
‘transformation’. Consequently, there is a determined
effort to establish intermediate agencies, such as business
innovation centres, business technology centres and
incubators. In the university system, there has been a
strong focus has on improving quality.

Structural arrangements, priorities and policies
The Ministry of Research and Technology (MoRT) is
responsible for driving S&T policy. In 2005, it announced a
20-year vision statement. In this vision statement, S&T is
portrayed as a ‘main force’ for sustainable prosperity.
Seven R&D agencies come under the direct authority of
MoRT. These are: the National Institute for Scientific
Research (LIPI), the Agency for the Assessment and
Application of Technology (BPPT); the National Institute
of Aeronautics and Space (LAPAN); the National 
Co-ordinating Agency of Survey and Mapping
(BAKOSURTANAL); the National Standardisation Agency
(BSN); the National Nuclear Energy Agency (BATAN) and
the National Nuclear Energy Control Board (BAPETEN). 
A set of additional institutes and centres reside under the
jurisdiction of various ministries. 

Four key science programmes were identified for
development in 2005–2009: (1) R&D; (2) diffusion and
utilization of S&T; (3) institutional capacity-building and; 
(4) increasing the industrial capacity of S&T. For 2009, a set of
thematic programmes were also identified (Firdausy, 2006): 

I tsunami early warning system; 
I open source (software development); 
I agro-technology; 
I marine science; 
I defence from bioterrorism; 
I bio-ethics; 
I DNA forensic technology;
I natural resource accounting. 

Since 2002, a number of presidential decrees have driven
the development of the science system, for example: the
2005 decree for Technology Transfer of Property Rights and
Outputs of R&D and the 2006 Decree of Permission for
International Researchers, Bodies and Institutions to
Conduct Research Activities in Indonesia. The latter reflects
an overall strategy to develop international collaboration. 

SE Asia+Oceania [12] [P3]:Layout 1  18/10/10  20:02  Page 451

The numbers of researchers in the system appeared to 
slip back around the mid-2000s but there has since been 
a concerted effort to build up numbers of research
personnel in national S&T institutions. Publication output
has only progressed modestly, thanks to a high level of
international co-authorship. Japan is the primary country of
origin for collaborators, followed by the USA and Australia
(Table 5). Output has been dominated by biological,
biomedical and medical sciences, presenting a pattern
somewhat similar to that of Cambodia and New Zealand.

In 2009, there were 2 600 institutions providing higher
education, including universities, academies and
institutes. The emphasis has been on strengthening the
research capacity and quality of just a fraction of the top
universities.

Indonesian patenting activity has remained limited
throughout the first decade of the century, with
essentially no growth in the patent system. Developing
IPR centres and technology transfer institutions are part of
the national strategy to stimulate patenting activity.

Future trends and challenges for Indonesia
MoRT has identified three key challenges: overcoming the
mismatch between public sector research output and the
demands of industry; enhancing R&D capacity in the
private sector; and overcoming the structural barriers
between the public and private sectors. 

Science networks have been identified as a mechanism 
for responding to these challenges. Current policies focus
on fostering national co-operation in the key areas noted
above, in order to share resources, utilize economies of
scale and build both virtual and actual centres of
excellence. International networking is being encouraged
to increase the quality and quantity of researchers
engaged in international research. 

Like many other countries in the region, Indonesia has
also identified the need to broaden community
acceptance and understanding of how S&T serve to
enhance development.

Human resources are likely to remain a major challenge.
Balancing efforts to augment the pool of researchers
against budget constraints from the global recession will
make the task of network-building all the more
imperative.

Southeast Asia and Oceania

Malaysia
S&T and economic status
Malaysia has made rapid progress in science, technology
and economic development, recovering rapidly from the
Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s. The economy is
dominated by a high ratio of manufacturing (65%) among
exports, ranking 21st in the world merchandise export value
index. As with the Philippines, much of this is a product of
foreign firms located in the country. GDP per capita in 2008
amounted to US$ 8 197. The GERD/GDP ratio has grown
from 0.49% in 2000 to 0.64% in 2006 (Table 1).

Growth in business expenditure on R&D as a proportion of
GERD has been a major contributor to this expansion,
rising from 58% in 2000 to 85% in 2006. For the immediate
future, this may be a double-edged sword, as contractions
in R&D investment by many multinational firms following
the global recession may leave a vacuum that might not
easily be covered by the increase in public expenditure. 
In terms of the Knowledge Index, Malaysia has remained
stationary in 48th position. The economy ranks
comparatively highly on the ICT and innovation variables,
with education remaining the key challenge. Internet
usage has grown dramatically, with 56% of the population
enjoying access in 2008 (Figure 1). 

Publication output has risen rapidly over the past decade,
very much led by domestic capacity. The international 
co-authorship rate for Malaysian scientists was of the same
order as for Australia and New Zealand. Interestingly, 
China was the primary contributor to international 
co-authorship. In contrast to most other countries in the
region, chemistry dominated Malaysia’s scientific output.

Numbers of S&T personnel have continued to climb. So
too has the number of patents. Malaysia has recorded the
fastest growth in patenting activity of all countries in the
region, from only 63 USTPO registered patents in 2000 to
over 200 in 2007. Consistent with these data is the good
national performance in high-tech exports (see page 445).

Structural arrangements, priorities and policies
The Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation is the
leading national institution, drawing STI policies towards 
a common goal. The second National Plan for Science and
Technology Policy 2002-2020, adopted in 2003, set out a
clear strategy of developing institutions and partnerships
to enhance Malaysia’s economic position. Underpinning
this strategy are four specific capacity-building targets:

UNESCO SCIENCE REPORT 2010

S&T institutional capacity, commercialization of R&D
output, human resource development, and generating a
culture of techno-entrepreneurship.

The National Plan presented a vision for 2020 centred on
those areas that could yield the highest economic pay-
off. This included policy considerations of: demonstrated
need, availability of national advantage, relevance and
the capacity to achieve objectives. This approach to
strategic planning is common across many of the
industrially advanced economies, such as Singapore,
Australia and New Zealand. However, Malaysia has been
more explicit than many other countries in identifying
industrial targets for the science base. 
These include: 
I advanced manufacturing and materials; 
I micro-electronics;
I biotechnology; 
I ICTs and multimedia; 
I energy; 
I aerospace;
I nanotechnology; 
I photonics;
I pharmaceuticals. 

In addition, Malaysia has announced plans to engage in
roadmapping-type exercises in key industrial sectors. 

Future trends and challenges for Malaysia
Over the past decade, there has been a clear shift towards
demand-driven R&D. However, a shortage of skills is likely
to hamper development efforts. In spite of considerable
growth in human resources in S&T overall, there is some
evidence of a net loss of scientific personnel across many
fields, with the notable exception of agricultural science
and chemistry.

Another major challenge for Malaysian S&T will be to
maintain and nurture growth in public sector investment
in basic science through the current period of global
economic downturn.

The Philippines
S&T and economic status
The Philippines has struggled to maintain and develop its
science system since the Asian financial crisis. For many
indicators, it has barely kept pace with regional S&T
development. GERD as a proportion of GDP has actually
fallen, as has GERD per capita. Only Indonesia and

452

Cambodia record lower GERD/GDP ratios (Table 1). With
the second-largest population in the region, the economy
ranks 56th in terms of merchandise exports. GDP per capita
amounted to US$ 1 856 in 2009. Manufactured goods
comprised 83% of merchandise exports in 2008 but this
was largely because of the dominance of foreign firms
operating in the economy. The activity of many of these is
concentrated in electronics manufacturing and assembly.
The National Science and Technology Plan, 2002–2020
describes the economy as ‘sluggish or slow moving with
uncontrolled urbanisation’.

Although the business sector share of GERD is high, 
this is misleading. As in Malaysia, it is due to a high level 
of foreign manufacturing. A clear challenge for S&T policy
will be to seek ways to leverage technological capacity
into local firms and into sectors other than the assembly
of electrical components.

Structural arrangements, priorities and policies
The Department of Science and Technology is the key
agency in the Philippines, with policy development co-
ordinated by a series of sectoral councils. The National
Science and Technology Plan, 2002–2020 sets out the short-
and long-term strategy for deriving greater benefits from
investment in science. Strategic emphasis is placed on
raising GERD to 2% of GDP by 2020 and doubling the share
of business R&D investment. Strategic emphasis is also
placed on promoting technology transfer, improving
human development indices, promoting S&T advocacy
and expanding science networks.

The Philippines is also seeking to identify key areas for
innovation-led growth. Biotechnology and ICTs get a
particular mention. There is an expectation that, by 2020,
the economy will have developed a wide range of globally
competitive products with high-tech content. Strategies for
achieving these goals included clustering – an approach
successfully adopted by Singapore (see overleaf) – and
targeting human resource development in S&T. The Plan
targets small and medium-sized enterprises as loci for
stimulating local S&T spill-overs. The Philippines has also
been pursuing a strategy for communicating science to the
broader population through various media-based strategies.
This vision for the future foreshadows the Philippines as
carving out niches in selected S&T areas that could be
described as world-class. Specific longer-term sectoral
priorities defined in the 2002–2020 plan are farther-
ranging and broader than, for example, in Singapore. 

SE Asia+Oceania [12] [P3]:Layout 1  18/10/10  20:02  Page 453

They include: 
I agriculture and forestry; 
I health and medicine; 
I biotechnology; 
I ICTs; 
I micro-electronics; 
I materials science; 
I the environment; 
I natural disaster mitigation;
I energy; 
I manufacturing and process engineering. 

Future trends and challenges for the Philippines
High-tech manufacturing exports are tied to a small number
of very large multinational corporations. A key challenge will
be to maintain the broad range of desired priorities within
the financial constraints presented by the global recession. 

Many ambitious targets are set out in the national plan for
2002–2020. Although these targets are very clear, the
institutional and economic capacity to deliver them has not
been forthcoming. In particular, the goal to raise the
Philippines’ global ranking in key areas is challenged by the
high achievements of many other countries in the Asian
region. For example, the Philippines has actually fallen 
16 places on the World Knowledge Economy Index, from
65th to 89th position. Although still ranking above Indonesia,
the economy is well behind those of Malaysia and Thailand.

Singapore
S&T and economic status
Singapore is one of the smaller countries in the region with
a population only slightly larger than that of New Zealand.
Despite its small geographical size and population, it has
demonstrated considerable success in developing a
globally competitive science system. In 2008, Singapore’s
economy recorded GDP per capita of US$ 39 423, the
second-highest of the countries covered in the present
chapter after Australia. It ranks 14th in terms of world
merchandise export value. According to the World Bank,
Singapore is one of only two countries in the region (Viet
Nam being the other) that improved their world ranking in
the Knowledge Index between 1995 and 2008. Singapore
outranked all countries covered in the present chapter for
the related variables of  ‘economic incentive regime, ICTs’
and ‘innovation’. The country’s growth in publications may
not have not been as dramatic as some of the countries
starting from a smaller base but, significantly, growth has
been strongly driven by Singapore-based scientists.

Southeast Asia and Oceania

Structural arrangements, priorities and policies
Singapore’s five-year National Science and Technology
Plan published in 2000 noted the need to increase the
number and quality of human resources in S&T
substantially. The Plan for 2005–2010 reinforced this
strategy, emphasizing the need to build on three areas
to achieve ‘translational competency’: nurturing local
talent; recruiting global talent and working with industry
to promote technology development and transfer (MTIS,
2006). Co-ordination for implementing the plan is
divided between the Agency for Science, Technology
and Research (A*STAR) for public sector activities and the
Economic Development Board for private sector
activities. Throughout the decade, Singapore has
remained focused on recruiting key world-renowned
scientists, offering them globally competitive salaries
and conditions. The success of this recruitment
campaign is reflected in a considerable level of growth
(nearly 50%) in the number of researchers per million in
the total population between 2000 and 2007.

Although the global recession has led to a tighter focus on
the development of S&T, growth since 2000 has been
remarkable. The national approach has been to cluster key
research agencies geographically to provide a national
knowledge hub with ties to institutes abroad that are
world-renowned for scientific endeavour in two key areas:
ICTs and biomedical research. To achieve this, the Science
and Engineering Council has drawn together seven
research institutions concerned with ICT to create
Fusionopolis and the Biomedical Research Council has
created a cluster of five key biomedical research institutes
to form Biopolis. These two clusters are at the heart of
Singapore’s drive to create global centres of excellence in
these two niche areas. 

The Singaporean approach is very much policy-driven. For
example, ministerial-level steering committees have been
established to drive development in key areas, including
environment and water technologies, and interactive
digital media. While the general approach is to build close
links between public-funded science and business, there is
still a strong focus on basic research.

Future trends and challenges for Singapore
The government fixed a target in 2006 of achieving a
GERD/GDP ratio of 3% by 2010. A challenge for Singapore
will be to consolidate the significant scientific growth that
has occurred throughout the decade and maintain the

comparatively high levels of investment in the wake of the
global recession. The business sector was a major
contributor to GERD even before the turn of the century and
has increased its share over the past decade. Maintaining
the momentum in the wake of the global recession will thus
remain a challenge for the next few years. 

Singapore has been highly successful in attracting foreign
scientists and technicians to its well-funded laboratories and
institutions. Another key challenge will be maintain this level
of human capital and further develop the country’s training
system to meet technical demands in the longer term.

Thailand
S&T and economic status
Thailand ranks 26th in terms of world merchandise exports
and, like Malaysia and the Philippines, these exports are
dominated by manufactured exports. GDP per capita in
2008 came to US$ 4 187. The GERD/GDP ratio for Thailand
is low and actually fell marginally from 0.26% in 2001 to
0.25% in 2007. On the World Bank’s Knowledge Economy
Index, Thailand ranks 63rd, well behind Malaysia and
Singapore but well ahead of Viet Nam.

Objectives in three key areas have been identified for
national development and improving overall economic
performance. The first goal is to increase the total number
of firms undertaking innovation. The second is to improve
management skills and the third is to raise the country’s
competitiveness in S&T against international benchmarks.

The targets for development cover three main sectors: 

I the industrial sector, comprising industries selected by
the government and those possessing future potential,
including the food, automotive, software, microchip
and textile industies, tourism, health-related services
and the bio-industry; 

I the community economy, focusing on quality upgrades

of the One-Village-One-Product programme . This
programme has now been in place for two decades. 
It is directed towards improving communities’ access 
to finance and management skills; 

I the social sector, covering environmental development,

support for children and the underprivileged and so
forth. An additional focus after the present Abisit
Goverment came to power in 2009 was to make

454

Thailand a ‘creative economy’ based on the creativity,
talent and unique culture of the Thai people.

The main strength of the Thai system can be found in
private firms. More intense competition in the global market
and the Asian financial crisis of 1997 have, to some degree,
led to a behaviour change among Thai firms. After the 1997
crisis, they abandoned their long-standing attitude of
relying on off-the-shelf foreign technologies in favour of
developing in-house R&D capabilities. Several large
conglomerates recently expanded their R&D activities and a
number of smaller companies have begun collaborating
with university R&D groups to develop technology. Another
new phenomenon is that multinational corporations are
now engaging in more technologically sophisticated
activities than before, such as product design. In the
automotive industry, for example, several Japanese car-
makers, such as Toyota, Honda, Isuzu and Nissan, have set
up technical centres in Thailand. Toyota’s technical centre
employs 600 R&D engineers.

Structural arrangements, priorities and policies
The main objectives of the current National Science and
Technology Strategic Plan (2004–2013) are to enhance
Thailand’s capability to adapt to rapid change in the
globalization era and strengthen the country’s long-term
competitiveness. The vision statement in the Plan is
consistent with the government’s development goals of
sustainable competitiveness, a strong community
economy, a knowledge society, healthy environment and
better quality of life. The Plan emphasizes four fundamental
development factors for achieving these goals: a strong
national innovation system, robust human resources, an
enabling environment for development and capacity in
four core future technologies: ICTs, biotechnology,
materials science and nanotechnology. 

The cluster concept has been the main policy for industrial
collaboration at the local, national and regional levels ever
since the Thaksin Government (2001–2006) and remains
so. The government declared five strategic clusters for
Thailand to pursue: automotive industry, food industry,
tourism, fashion and software. These are not conceived
simply as geographical clusters but rather as virtual
clusters with innovation links that can be supported
through policy. Visions for these five clusters have been
defined as: Kitchen of the World (food cluster), Detroit of
Asia (automotive cluster), Asia Tropical Fashion (fashion
cluster) , World Graphic Design and Animation Centre

Southeast Asia and Oceania

(software cluster), and Asia Tourism Capital. At the
regional level, Thailand has been divided into 
19 geographical areas. Each area has had to plan and
implement its own cluster strategy, focusing on a few
strategic products or services. Each has been supervised
by the so-called Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Governors,
who have been given authority by the central
government to act like provincial CEOs. The cluster
concept has also been applied at the local level to build
the capacity of the grassroot economy in the name of
‘community-based clusters’, especially to help the 
One-Village-One Product programme succeed.

An ‘innovative nation with wisdom and a learning base’
was one of Thailand’s Dreams projected by the Thaksin
Government within attempts to make this dream (one of
seven) come true, several strategies were devised. These
include: continual investment in R&D, an environment
conducive to attracting and stimulating innovation, high
accessibility to knowledge and information across the
nation, fluent English as a second language, possessing a
stronglearning basis, such as a passion for reading and
greater access to cheap but good books (Phasukavanich,
2003). The issue of ‘competitiveness’ has also been made a
high priority, as illustrated by the establishment of a
National Competitiveness Committee in 2003 chaired by
the prime minister.

The ten-year National Science and Technology Strategic Plan
(2004–2013) placed the concepts of a national innovation
system and industrial clusters at its heart by highlighting
concrete measures to stimulate their development. This
plan marks the country’s ‘official’ transition from an S&T
policy to an STI policy. However, to date, neither the
National Science and Technology Strategic Plan nor the
Basic Law on Science, Technology and Innovation has
adopted, in practice, the innovation system approach as
the main policy content (Intarakumnerd, 2006). 

Future trends and challenges for Thailand
Several key weaknesses in the Thai policy-making process
have been identified by local analysts. These include:
ineffective supra-ministerial cross-cutting policy processes
and a lack of inter-ministerial co-ordinating mechanisms;
an imbalance in the STI policy-making process between
the key science ministry, the Ministry of Science and
Technology (MoST), and other ministries with an
economic mission; and the limited participation of the
private sector in the policy-making process. 

In Thailand, there is no structured mechanism for 
co-ordination between ministries. The national plan for
2004–2013 creates the position of Chief Science Officer in
every relevant ministry to co-ordinate S&T activities and
interact with the National Competitiveness Committee.
However, these posts still exist only on paper today. MoST
plays a more central role in STI policy planning and
implementation than economic agencies like the Ministry
of Industry. This imbalance contrasts with the situation in
Chinese Taipei, the Republic of Korea and Japan, where
economic agencies like the Japanese Ministry of
International Trade and Industry, the Korean Economic
Planning Board (EPB) and the Taiwanese Ministry of
Economic Affairs play significant roles in this area.

A further challenge is to overcome inconsistencies in the
amount of resources allocated to different strategies for
S&T development. For example, initiatives directed
towards enhancing S&T training capacity in the private
sector are dwarfed by the level of resources directed
towards new initiatives in the public research sector.
Systemic failures also need to be overcome, such as by
providing grants where they are needed or direct
subsidies, as in the East Asian newly industrialized
economies, to help private firms develop their
technological capabilities. 

Timor Leste
Timor Leste has the smallest population and economy of all
the countries discussed in the present chapter, with the
exception of some of the Pacific Island nations. It has been
defined as the poorest Asian nation. The country is still in the
early stages of recovery from socio-political turmoil since
gaining independence in 1999. Few data are available on
economic development and even fewer on S&T. However, it
is known that FDI accounts for over 40% of GDP, an indicator
of the economy’s high level of dependence on international
funding. Unemployment is estimated to be around 70%.
Over 80% of the population is dependent on agriculture,
forestry or fisheries. Consequently, environmental issues are
of prime concern. 

There is no designated agency with overall responsibility
for S&T but the Ministry of Education is the biggest source
of funding. After the turmoil of the late 1990s, the country’s
only university, the Universidade Nacional de Timor-Leste,
re-opened in 2000. There are currently five faculties that
reflect the country’s development needs: agriculture,
political science, economics, education and engineering.

UNESCO SCIENCE REPORT 2010

The National Research Centre and the Institute of Linguistics
opened in July 2001 to support the work of the faculties.
Longer-term planning foreshadows the development of
tertiary studies in health, law, communications,
accounting, fisheries, architecture, physics and chemistry. 

Broader institutional development for S&T is only now just
under way, with US$ 500 000 having been allocated in 2009
towards the establishment and maintenance of national
laboratories. National parks have recently been established,
including some marine parks. Their development will rely
on international knowledge-based linkages. 

According to the president, the economy is faring well,
with more than 10% real growth at the end of 2008, in
spite of the global recession. Nevertheless, it will be a big
challenge to overcome the lack of educated or skilled
personnel. Weak public institutions and inadequate
infrastructure compound these difficulties. Significant oil
reserves offer a glimmer of hope for future economic
development but the technical resources required to
manage these in order to obtain maximum benefit
remain, as with Cambodia, a major challenge for the
country’s nascent technical capacity.

Viet Nam
S&T and economic status
The Vietnamese economy has been undergoing
considerable restructuring and transformation. This has
carried through into the area of STI. Viet Nam is one of the
few countries covered in the present chapter that has
been gaining ground in the World Bank Knowledge for
Development index; it currently ranks 51st on the world
merchandise trade index. However, GDP per capita of 
US$ 1 041 reflects the considerable disparities in income
across the country. Investment in S&T in Viet Nam remains
low, at just US$ 5 per capita in 2007, compared to 
US$ 20 for China in 2004 and US $1 000 in the Republic of
Korea in 2007.

To cope with the demands of fulfilling the requirements
for joining WTO, Viet Nam has enacted the Intellectual
Property Law (2005) and Technology Transfer Law (2006).
The aim of these two laws is to protect the rights and
responsibilities of people and organizations who own
intellectual property or invest in technology transfer,
according to international standards. Further decrees and
resolutions have been issued by the government give
greater autonomy to R&D organizations and provide firms
with financial incentives. These measures are a radical
departure from the situation prevailing just a decade ago
when all S&T activity fell under the exclusive jurisdiction
of the state.

Tangible achievements of R&D in recent years include
Vietnamese script identification and processing
software, kits for virus-related disease testing, the
construction of a 53 000 tonne ship, the first satellite
Vinasat and advancements in agriculture. In December
2009, these success stories and others were celebrated
by a gathering of nearly 500 representatives of S&T
organizations. 

Structural arrangements, priorities and policies
As in Thailand, Vietnamese policies are evolving from S&T
policy to STI policy. A growing number of features of the
national innovation system concept have been
incorporated into the policy-making process. Six
important STI policy areas were identified by the prime
minister in September 2004: 

■ improve the process of formulating R&D projects

funded by the state budget;

■ reform state management of public 

R&D institutions;

■ reform S&T financing; 
■ reform human resource management in S&T;
■ develop technological markets; 
■ improve state management of S&T.

S&T policies in Viet Nam have been described as comprising
two distinct types: explicit and implicit. Explicit policies
emerged in 1987 with the government’s decision to remove
the state monopoly on S&T. This was followed by decrees on
foreign technology transfer (1988), organizational and
individual rights to enter into contracts or to co-operate in
S&T (1992) and on external grants in support of S&T (1994).
A foreign investment law was adopted in 1995 that governs
S&T activities in economic projects. 

At this stage, these have been defined as general areas for
future policy action. As yet, there is little evidence as to
how these areas might be addressed across different
agencies. Nevertheless, they do suggest a shift towards a
more systemic, networked approach to STI.

Those national institutes for research which do not come
directly under an individual government ministry or
agency were designed in Viet Nam to act as national

456

SE Asia+Oceania [12] [P3]:Layout 1  18/10/10  20:02  Page 457

Southeast Asia and Oceania

networks of S&T and placed under the Office of the Prime
Minister. They are not instruments for implementing
policies laid down by ministries but rather focus on R&D.
The most influential of these institutes is the National
Centre of Natural Science and Technology, which
performs advanced basic research primarily in
mathematics and theoretical physics. This particularity of
Viet Nam finds a parallel in the Advanced Institute of
Science and Technology under the Ministry of Economy,
Trade and Industry in Japan and the Industrial
Technology Research Institute under the Ministry of
Economic Affairs in Chinese Taipei. 

Innovation has emerged centre stage in many initiatives.
For example, there was a national forum on innovation
strategy in 2006. The Ministry of Science and Technology
is also trying to establish collaboration with global players
like IBM to promote innovation. Firms, as the centre of
innovation, are obtaining a more crucial role in the
learning process. 

A new actor has also emerged in the national innovation
system, namely, quasi-governmental, quasi-private
organizations. These provide mainly technical, information
gathering and technology consulting services. They throw
bridges between universities, government research and
technology organizations and firms. This type of
organization has been permitted since the early 1990s as
a result of economic reform policy. Scientists and
researchers who were formerly, or are currently, employed
at government institutes or universities have established
many of these organizations. It is estimated that over 
500 such organizations, often called ‘centres’, are in
operation (Sinh, 2009).

Future trends and challenges for Viet Nam
Industry collaboration policy is a major area of weakness
in Viet Nam, with some notable exceptions like Nong Lam
University. Its administration and research centres
contribute strongly to the agriculture sector: designing
efficient agriculture machines and providing technical
assistances to farmers. Weak linkages between
government research institutes and private firms have
been acknowledged by the government. However,
research institutes were recently allowed to set up their
own companies. This is an attempt to reduce the
dichotomy between production (done by firms) and
technology development activities (done by research
institutes). 

Another future challenge for the government is the fact
that the major source of investment in S&T is the state
budget. Trying to build linkages between universities,
public research institutes and private firms entirely via
state investment presents a real difficulty. Increasing the
level of private investment in S&T will not be easy,
particularly in the years following the global recession
when all other countries in the region will be seeking to
create incentives to attract much-needed private
investment.

COUNTRY PROFILES: 
The Pacific Island states

Science and R&D in the Pacific
The Pacific Island states are diverse, yet each is in many
ways unique. Although science is a comparatively low
priority among policy-makers, there is an emerging
regional presence in S&T. This is largely due to the
common concerns confronting many of the smaller 
low-lying Pacific nations, such as sea-level rise, saltwater
intrusion and the growing frequency of destructive
storms. Regional organizations increasingly play an
important role in providing member countries with
specialized expertise and assistance in conducting
research in priority areas that they would otherwise be
unable to afford. A number of regional bodies are
involved in conducting R&D studies on environmental
and economic issues, renewable energy, health care and
social and cultural issues facing the region. Many of
these are based in Fiji. Organizations include the Asia
Pacific Regional Environment Network (APRENET), the
University of the South Pacific (USP), the Secretariat of
the Pacific Community (SPC) with its head office in New
Caledonia, the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat (PIFS),
Pacific Island Geosciences; the Pacific Island Association
of Non-Governmental Organisations (PIANGO), the
Ecumenical Centre for Research, Education and
Advocacy (ECREA), the International Council for the
Study of the Pacific Islands (ICSPI) and the Pacific
Operations Centre (EPOC) of the United Nations
Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the
Pacific (UNESCAP).

These regional institutions and initiatives have been
successful in generating high-quality information on
research. Among these, the Secretariat of the Pacific

UNESCO SCIENCE REPORT 2010

Box 1: The Secretariat of the Pacific Community 

The Secretariat of the Pacific
Community (SPC) was the first
regional organization in the Pacific. 
It was established in 1947 as the
South Pacific Commission. The SPC
now acts as an international body. It
delivers priority work programmes to
member countries and territories to
develop professional, scientific,
technical, research and management
capacity with a focus on:

I land resources, including forestry

and agriculture; 

I marine resources, including

coastal and oceanic fisheries, 
as well as related broader
environmental issues;

I social resources, with a focus on

women, youth and culture. 

Most SPC programmes are funded by
the EU, the Australian Centre for
International Agricultural Research
(ACIAR), AUSAID, NZAID, the German 
Co-operation Agency (GTZ) and
Chinese Taipei. 

The Pacific Agricultural Plant

Genetic Resources Network
(PAPGREN) was set up in 2004, in
order to ensure the survival of Pacific
food crops by maintaining a diversity
of plant stocks. It has been one of the
key achievements of the SPC
programmes. Financial support for
PAPGREN is provided by ACIAR and
NZAID. The ‘seeds’ of PAPGREN were
sown in 1998 when the SPC created a
regional genebank that is now known
as the Centre for Pacific Crops and
Trees (CePaCT).

The Pacific Regional Information

SysteM (PRISM) is the brainchild of the
region’s National Statistical Offices
(NSOs). It was adopted by the SPC in
2002 with support from the UK
Department for International
Development. The aim is to give
National Statistical Offices the tools and
skills necessary to develop, publish and
maintain statistical indicators,
summaries, reports and so on for the
region. As of 2010, no data were yet
available on R&D in the region. 

The four founding members of
the SPC remain members: Australia,
France, New Zealand and the USA.

Island states and territories which are

Community (SPC) plays a key role in developing S&T
competencies in the region (Box 1).

The past few years have seen an improvement in 
R&D capacity in the higher education sector in
particular, in the midst of continuing high turnover 
in S&T personnel. Much of the credit for the
emergence of a vibrant, if fledgling research culture
can go to institutions like the USP and the Fiji School
of Medicine, founded in 1979, as well as other more
recent institutions like the University of Fiji (UoF) and
the Fiji National University (FNU). 

Established in 2006, UoF has lost no time in laying 
the groundwork for research on matters of national
interest. It has already established two centres: the
Centre for Energy, Environment and Sustainable
Development and the Centre for Indigenous Studies. 
In 2010, it was planning to promote a rural
electrification programme using photovoltaic battery
systems which it plans to adapt with the assistance of
the Tata Energy Research Institute in New Delhi, India
(personal submission). 

Of even more recent vintage is the FNU3, dating from
January 2010. The FNU has yet to articulate its strategic
approach to serving national priorities using its own S&T
capabilities.

The oldest university in the region, the USP4 focuses
heavily on the concerns of the Pacific Islands. The
university concentrates research on sustainable
development in the broad sense of the word, as R&D
covers environmental economics, S&T and social and
cultural issues. Capitalizing on current scholarship
programmes with Australia, New Zealand, Chinese Taipei
and France, the university plans to enhance international
and regional research partnerships, according to the USP
Strategic Plan 2010–2012. 

3. The FNU was formed by bringing six existing organizations under one
umbrella: Fiji College of Agriculture, Fiji Institute of Advanced Education,
Fiji School of Medicine, Fiji School of Nursing, Fiji Teacher Training School
and Fiji Institute of Technology.

4. The main campus of the USP is in Suva, Fiji. Founded in 1968, the
university is supported by 12 Pacific Island countries: Cook Islands, Fiji,
Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru, Niue, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tokelau,
Tonga, Tuvalu and Vanuatu.

Southeast Asia and Oceania

Intergovernmental organizations such as the United
Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the United
Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund (UNICEF)
also play an important role by way of targeted research
and project assistance with soft technologies in their
respective areas of expertise. Private-sector industrial R&D
in the region is almost non-existent, as firms’
technological requirements can be adequately satisfied
through technology transfer from beyond the region. The
government established the Papua New Guinea Research,
Science and Technology Council in 2008 to embark upon
research and innovation, and to pave the way for
industrialization in the light of major development
projects in mining, oil and gas. 

There is only limited information available for some Pacific
Island states on priority areas for science. In the section
that follows, these countries are therefore discussed as a
group rather than individually.

Trends and challenges in the Pacific Islands 
Food and energy security
The region is heavily dependent on imported foodstuffs.
This is due to a decline in per capita food production and
an imbalance in demand for local foodstuffs within island
nations5. In line with this observation, the Pacific Islands
Forum Action Plan 2009 emphasized the need to sustain
momentum to ensure better food and energy security,
maximize the sustainable economic returns for fisheries
and design an appropriate disaster-risk management
programme to minimize any adverse impact of natural
disasters on agriculture.

ICTs
Pacific Island countries are experiencing a wave of
liberalization and development of their telecommunications
markets. At present, integration of ICTs into development
efforts is not uniform across the region. Papua New Guinea
has a relatively advanced telecom network but teledensity
and mobile and Internet penetration remain extremely low,
at less than 2%. Fiji also has a fairly reliable and efficient
telecom system but low Internet penetration (12% in 2008). 

The Pacific ICT Ministerial Forum held in February 2009
agreed to a set of priorities and actions to spur ICT
development in the Pacific. Among the agreed priorities
were: regional connectivity initiatives, the building of
human capacity, shared regulatory resources and the use
of ICTs for early warning and response systems. The Pacific

Region Headquarters of the US National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), situated in
Honolulu, serves as the key source of early warning
bulletins for natural disasters. Regional connectivity
needs improving rapidly, however, and staff will need
advanced training if the response system is to be
effective.

Climate change
Climate change is a great challenge for Pacific Island
states. It threatens not only livelihoods and living
standards but the very viability of communities.
Although Pacific Island states play a small role in causing
climate change, the impact on them is great. Many Pacific
Islands face new challenges like ensuring access to
freshwater in the wake of contamination of groundwater
with seawater as a result of sea-level rise and the greater
frequency of violent storms. These phenomena place the
security and health of communities in greater jeopardy
than before. Some habitats and island states even face
obliteration, such as Tuvalu, which lies on average just 
1.5 m above sea level.

For the SPC, scientific research is required to model the
future impact of climate change on agriculture and
forestry in particular and devise means of adaptation, 
in order to maintain these sectors. In this regard, the
Tsukuba Declaration outlines a strategy for adapting
agriculture to climate change in the Pacific (Tsukuba,
2008). It advocates the development of ‘climate ready’6
collections of crop varieties, for example, at the region’s
Centre for Pacific Crops and Trees (Box 1).

Education
Policies for developing better education systems are a
priority in the region. With the technology boom in 
Asia–Pacific, the need to integrate modern technology
into classroom instruction is on everyone’s lips. The
following measures have been proposed to achieve 21st
century competencies and skills in Asia–Pacific. All are of
high relevance to the Pacific Islands: evidence-based
learning approaches, cognitive research, enhancement
of the professional development of science teachers,
inclusion, and usage of modern ICT facilities so that

schools can access Internet for classroom activities.
Taking this point a step further, Papua New Guinea’s
National Higher Education Plan 2030 (forthcoming) aims
to make research and S&T the fundamental priority of
the higher education sector, as these twin engines will
drive the National Vision 2050.

Health
A better delivery of health services is considered a high
priority in the region, in order to minimize child
mortality, maternal mortality and obesity, and tackle
HIV/AIDS issues. Obesity seems to be a key health
problem among Pacific Islanders, consuming a very large
proportion of the health budget. As the key health
research school in the region, the Fiji School of Medicine
has taken it upon itself to establish the Pacific STI & HIV
Research Centre7 and the Centre for Health Information,
Policy and Systems, launched in 2009 and 2010
respectively.

Towards an S&T policy for the Pacific
The features common to Pacific Islands suggest that
there may well be some advantage in promoting
science policy at the regional level. Such an approach
would serve to foster collaboration across the region.
In an attempt to ascertain whether it would be feasible
to draw up a regional policy on S&T, the Australian
National University and UNESCO collaborated with 
SPC on a review of existing literature on formal science
policy in the Pacific Islands covering agriculture, health,
environment and education. The review noted the
advantages of having a science policy at a regional
level, at least for environmental and biosecurity
matters (Perera and Lamberts, 2006). The review
stressed that, in order to develop S&T that is
appropriate and applicable to the socio-economic
climate of the Pacific, provisions would need to be
made for wide consultations with governments and
other key stakeholders in the region, in order to obtain
a clear indication of the perceived needs and interests
of each Pacific Island nation. In this regard, the absence
of basic statistics on S&T needs to be rectified to make
the Pacific Islands more visible in global science. 
These two issues — the consultation process and 
the generation of statistics in the region — become
fundamental requirements for moving towards an 
S&T policy for the region.

CONCLUSION

The country reviews presented in the present chapter
reflect considerable economic, industrial and social
diversity across Southeast Asia and Oceania. The region
is home to some of the world’s wealthiest industrially
developed economies and some of the world’s
poorest. The status of science in terms of capacity,
priorities and output consequently varies accordingly.
Behind these structural differences, there are some
common features in terms of the way in which science
is progressing.

Firstly, sustained growth over the past decade in both
the Chinese and Indian economies has been dramatic
and is already having a marked impact on regional S&T
capacity. Although this manifests itself in different
ways, the influence of the Indian and Chinese growth
affects almost all countries. For example, the
commodities boom through the 2000s, driven to a
large extent by India and China, has led to
considerable rise in mining-related R&D in Australia
and a consequent growth in business-sector R&D
investment. The growth in scientific publications from
India and China has also had the effect of limiting
comparative gain for all countries in terms of their
contribution to global output in scientific publications.
Furthermore, in co-authored publications from the
region, China and India are already among the top
three co-authoring countries for five of the countries
covered here. 

Secondly, in most countries, science policy has
become integrated with innovation policies. This has
been a global trend, as countries seek to use science
to drive economic competitiveness and, among the
less developed countries, development. A challenge
for the future will be to ensure that innovation policy
is not the sole driver of science policy and that the
national science base can remain sufficiently
comprehensive to enable global scientific
collaboration to continue. 

Thirdly, with the move from S&T to STI, there has
been a growing focus on policies to promote and
manage cross-sector R&D. Across the region, a range
of strategies for achieving this purpose is evident.
Many countries have introduced collaborative

SE Asia+Oceania [12] [P3]:Layout 1  18/10/10  20:02  Page 461

Southeast Asia and Oceania

project-funding schemes. Others have introduced
major initiatives like the Australian Cooperative
Research Centres programme. This program has been
in place in Australia since 1991 and has served as a
model for similar policy initiatives in other countries
(e.g. Thailand). Singapore has approached the issue
by making large, strategic investments to establish
cross-sector clusters like Biopolis. All countries that
have introduced such programmes have tied them in
one way or another to broad national strategic
priorities. 

There is also evidence of new knowledge hubs
emerging in some fields linked to those already
anchored in North America and Western Europe and,
in some ways, moving beyond these hubs in the
Northern Hemisphere. There is evidence, for example,
that Singapore is an emerging hub for biomedical and
engineering technologies, both in the region and
globally. 

Another common thread running through the region
is the growing attention being paid to climate change
and sustainable development. The role of science in
improving understanding of issues associated with
climate change and in mitigating or adapting to the
impact of climate change are reflected in the national
plans of most countries in Southeast Asia and Oceania.
In many cases, these issues are embedded in general
priority statements, even if the specifics of tackling the
challenge are left to public research institutes. One
example is the Thai Biotechnology Center under the
National Science and Technology Development
Agency. It has been conducting research over the past
five years on biogas from casava, corn, sugar cane and
pig’s waste. However, except for some pilot projects,
most are still in the early stages of research and thus a
long way from attracting markets or becoming a future
source of energy. 

In Fiji and elsewhere, foreign donor funds are being
directed towards sustainable agriculture and forestry.
In the Philippines, priorities for sustainable
agriculture are strategically linked to regional science
networks like ACIAR. In other countries, there are
localised responses. In Indonesia for example,
national priorities for renewable energy focus on
geothermal production and bioethanol, among
others. Australia has identified ‘environmentally

sustainable Australia’ as a research priority.
Furthermore, Australia’s Commonwealth Scientific
and Industrial Research Organisation has a
programme called Flagship for Energy Transformed
which focuses on developing clean, affordable
energy and transport technologies for a sustainable
future. The environment is also a key feature in the
country’s Sustainable Agriculture programme,
which addresses productivity and food security ‘in a
carbon constrained world’. In Australia, however, the
main driver of alternative energy R&D are incentives
like the introduction of levies to support household
production of solar electricity for regional grid
systems. In many parts of the country, householders
who have installed solar energy collectors and
inverters are paid a kilowatt hour rate for
production at more than twice the scheduled peak
purchase rate for electricity delivered through the
grid. Singapore’s Thematic Strategic Research
Programme noted that its 2005 five-year plan
includes Carbon Capture and Utilization and
Sustainable Materials which are directed towards
key environmental issues but with a market focus. 

In sum, the scientific response to climate change and
the quest for alternative energy sources in the region
is being driven by market demand, on the one hand,
and public debates and expectations, on the other
hand, coupled with local natural advantage. Even
among those countries with defined ‘green’ research
priorities, the level of investment is driven by a
combination of scientific quality and market demand.
The critical issue for most countries will be to ensure
they have a sufficient scientific base to serve these
consumer demands as they emerge.

Lastly, one of the clear trends across the region is 
the greater level of international engagement and 
co-operation. This is evident in the growing 
co-publication rates but also in the trend which sees
researchers spending time abroad as part of their
training and on-going collaboration throughout their
careers. This is a promising trend for many of the
smaller countries because only through international
scientific engagement will many local problems be
resolved. Only time will tell whether such an
engagement will serve the interests of the smaller
economies or simply those more deeply embedded in
the core of global scientific networks.

The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) are eight goals
to be achieved by 2015 that respond to the world’s main
development challenges. The MDGs are drawn from the
actions and targets contained in the Millennium
Declaration adopted by 189 nations and signed by 147
heads of State and government during the United Nations'
Millennium Summit in September 2000. 

The eight MDGs break down into 21 quantifiable targets
that are measured by 60 indicators. The specific indicators
can be found at: www.un.org/millenniumgoals

National STI policies clearly face a radically new global
landscape today, one in which the territorial policy focus is
coming under severe pressure… the steep drop in the
marginal cost of reproduction and diffusion of information 
has led to a world in which geographical borders are less
and less relevant for research and innovation. Knowledge
accumulation and knowledge diffusion are able to take
place at a faster pace, involving a growing number of
new entrants and providing a threat to established
institutions and positions.

Increasingly, international
diplomacy will take the form
of science diplomacy in the
years to come.

In the decade to 2007, the world experienced 
an unprecedented period of economic growth. 
This  cycle was brought to a halt when the fall-out
from the ‘subprime’ mortgage crisis in the USA in 2008
triggered a global economic recession. Two years on, what
impact has the global recession had on knowledge creation
around the world? 

Written by a team of independent experts who are each covering the country or
region from which they hail, the UNESCO Science Report 2010 analyses the trends and
developments that have shaped scientific research, innovation and higher education
over the past five years. The report depicts an increasingly competitive environment,
one in which the flow of information, knowledge, personnel and investment has
become a two-way traffic. Both China and India, for instance, are using their newfound
economic might to invest in high-tech companies in Europe and elsewhere to acquire
technological expertise overnight. Other large emerging economies are also spending
more on research and development than before, among them Brazil, Mexico, South
Africa and Turkey. 

If more countries are participating in science, we are also seeing a shift in global
influence. China is a hair’s breadth away from counting more researchers than either
the USA or the European Union, for instance, and now publishes more scientific articles
than Japan.

Even countries with a lesser scientific capacity are finding that they can acquire, adopt
and sometimes even transform existing technology and thereby ‘leapfrog’ over certain
costly investments, such as in infrastructure like land lines for telephones. Technological
progress is allowing these countries to produce more knowledge and participate more
actively than before in international networks and research partnerships with countries
in both North and South. This trend is fostering a democratization of science worldwide.
In turn, science diplomacy is becoming a key instrument of peace-building and
sustainable development in international relations. 

Taking up from where its predecessor left off in 2005, the UNESCO Science Report 2010
proposes a world tour of the status of science today that should enable ‘science watchers’
everywhere to decipher the trends that are shaping our rapidly changing world.
