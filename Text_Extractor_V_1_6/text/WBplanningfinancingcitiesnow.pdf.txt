tions that are tailored to the fiscal, political, 
and administrative realities of cities.

This  book,  Planning,  Connecting,  and 
Financing  Cities—Now  distills  the  lessons 
learned from these diagnostics into a practi-
cal  framework  for  sustainable  urbanization, 
which  is  organized  around  the  three  policy 
pillars  of  the  title.  The  coordination  among 
these  pillars  is  critical,  particularly  the  rela-
tionship between land use planning and haz-
ard  risk,  housing,  infrastructure,  and  urban 
transport. This framework has already helped 
to  reshape  core  urbanization  policy  debates 
and to integrate action across the urban space 
in countries such as Colombia, India, Uganda, 
and  Vietnam.  For  example,  In  India,  the 
 Urbanization  Review  provided  considerable 
inputs to the teams that shaped the contours 
of the 12th Five-Year Plan; in Colombia, the 
Urbanization Review helped in the design of 
a Mission for Cities—the product of a high- 
level committee for urban management.

We encourage you to read this report, and 
that you look at your own city and assess its 
planning, connecting, and financing and how 
they  are  coordinated  to  support  sustainable 
urbanization.

Cities  are  where  development  chal-

lenges  and  solutions  meet.  With  the 
cities of emerging economies expected 
to double from 2 billion to 4 billion people 
between  2000  and  2030—accompanied  by 
a  tripling  of  their  physical  footprint  from 
200,000  to  600,000  square  kilometers—the 
policies  and  investments  that  get  this  rapid 
urbanization  right  hold  the  key  to  resilient 
and sustainable development. The good news 
is  that  cities  in  the  developing  world  can 
build  on  the  knowledge  of  those  that  have 
been  successful  before  them  and  combine 
these insights with homegrown solutions and 
innovations to catalyze the engines of job cre-
ation, centers of innovation, and gateways to 
the global marketplace.

To  help  mayors  and  other  policy  makers 
identify the bottlenecks they face as urbaniza-
tion accelerates and to propose policy options 
to tackle such challenges, the World Bank—
with support from the Swiss State Secretariat 
for Economic Affairs (SECO) and the Cities 
Alliance—has  carried  out  diagnostics  called 
“Urbanization  Reviews”  in  12  countries 
across 4 continents. This program has created 
a bedrock of credible facts and a set of solu-

of  knowledge  on  urbanization  challenges 
and public policy implications in a variety of 
country settings. These prototypes have been 
piloted in Brazil, China, Colombia, India, In-

Overview

The world’s first cities were in the Uruk 

Cluster in Mesopotamia. The largest 
was Ur, which appears in the Epic of 
Gilgamesh (one of the earliest known works 
of literature, set around 3,500 BCE). Extend-
ing over 60 hectares, Ur was home to about 
24,000 people. But as an irrigation city—also 
providing marketing and defense services—
it  governed  and  extracted  surpluses  from  a 
neighboring population of about 500,000. Its 
urban population was densely concentrated, 
more than 400 people per hectare, and the 
planning  practices  were  strikingly  sophisti-
cated. With four main residential areas, Ur 
offered its inhabitants basic amenities such as 
well-laid-out streets and sanitation.

Cities have thus been planned from the 
beginning, enabling new settlements, eco-
nomic specialization, and cultural expres-
sion. The growth of cities is driven largely 
by the economic prosperity they help create. 
By enabling density—the concentration of 
people and economic activities in a small geo-
graphic space—cities have helped transform 
economies for many centuries. High densities 
enable social and economic interactions at 
a much higher frequency than in nonurban 
settings. These interactions create a vibrant 
market for ideas that translates into innova-
tions by entrepreneurs and investors. Indeed, 

50 percent of world gross domestic product 
(GDP) is produced on just 1.5 percent of the 
world’s land, almost all of it in cities (World 
Bank 2008). And various estimates point out 
that more than 80 percent of global GDP is 
generated in cities, with this share increasing 
rapidly.

But today, cities are growing at an unprec-
edented and challenging speed. City leaders 
are concerned about creating jobs and mak-
ing their cities competitive. They also worry 
about the quality of life for citizens, and how 
cities can lower their carbon trajectories.1 The 
city populations of emerging economies are 
expected to double between 2000 and 2030, 
from 2 billion to 4 billion people. Megacities, 
such as Tokyo, Mexico City, and São Paulo, 
are already home to 30 million people or 
more. The built-up area of cities worldwide 
will triple in size, from 200,000 to 600,000 
square kilometers. Such rapid population 
growth accompanied by an even faster spatial 
expansion of cities may lead to low-density 
development dominated by individual-vehicle 
transportation—a largely irreversible pattern 
(World Bank 2012b). With more than 70 per-
cent of generated energy now consumed in 
cities, and as much as 80 percent of global 
greenhouse gas emissions attributed to urban 
residents—and with vulnerability to natural

hazards increasingly concentrated in cities—
getting this rapidly paced urbanization right 
is the key to resilient and sustainable growth. 
This report is written for city leaders, but 
city leaders does not just mean mayors. It 
means anyone whose position—local, munic-
ipal, provincial, or national—gives him or 
her a policy- or decision-making role and 
thereby a stake in urban development.2 City 
leaders are mayors, but they are also direc-
tors of community-based organizations; they 
are subnational and national policy makers 
and ministers (of finance, investment, and 
planning); and they are private sector inves-
tors, developers, and service providers.

The report provides a framework to help 
city leaders make informed decisions for sus-
tainable development in their cities. What 
must be done to improve living conditions, 
especially in slums and hazard-prone areas? 
To create jobs? To bridge the divided cit-
ies (inclusion)? To expand the coverage and 
quality of basic infrastructure services? To 
manage the city’s physical form? In trying to 
address these challenges, city leaders often 
pursue  targeted  investments—providing 
housing subsidies, increasing infrastructure 
spending, or creating new growth poles. Yet 
history shows us that a more comprehensive 
set of rules is needed.

To think comprehensively about how pol-
icy and investment choices can influence the 
pace, magnitude, and impact of urbanization 
and city development, the World Bank has 
developed a program of diagnostics called the 
Urbanization Reviews. These diagnostics are 
being carried out in collaboration with city 
leaders in several pilot countries (box O.1).

At the heart of the diagnostic approach 
used in the Urbanization Reviews are the 
three main dimensions of urban development 
(figure O.1), also the focus of the three main 
chapters in this report:

•	 Planning—charting a course for cities by 
setting the terms of urbanization, espe-
cially policies for using urban land and 
expanding basic infrastructure and public 
services.

•	 Connecting—making  a  city’s  markets 
(labor, goods, and services) accessible to 

other cities and to other neighborhoods 
in the city, as well as to outside export 
markets.

•	 Financing—finding sources for large capi-
tal outlays needed to provide infrastruc-
ture and services as cities grow and urban-
ization picks up speed.

And for the framework of planning, con-
necting, and financing to work, a good gov-
ernance structure is a prerequisite. City lead-
ers, at all government levels, will have to 
work together. If this fails, everything else 
will stumble. 

Planning, connecting, and financing—
these are terms that policy makers use on a 
daily basis, but they often place financing 
first without fully considering the other two 
dimensions. Of the three dimensions, plan-
ning for land use and basic services is pri-
mary. Yet because planning must allow for 
people and products to be mobile, it must be 
coordinated with connecting at all stages of 
a city’s growth. What follows then is financ-
ing: a dimension that, although as necessary 
as the other two, should be city leaders’ last 
concern rather than their first.

This  point  cannot  be  emphasized  too 
strongly. A primary focus on financing—
though understandable as an attempt to meet 
urgent needs—is likely to result in unplanned 
cities if it is not coordinated with planning 
and connecting. And that will lock a city into 
undesirable physical forms that can set back 
its development for decades, even centuries. 
A city’s physical structures, once established, 
may remain in place for more than 150 years 
(Hallegatte 2009).

Putting financing first, without full con-
sideration of the other dimensions, is a mis-
take because it often neglects the overriding 
need to coordinate infrastructure improve-
ments (connecting) with policies (planning). 
And the lack of such coordination will be 
regretted  by  later  urban  generations.  For 
example, in Hanoi, Vietnam, a projected 
new mass transit system will extend in sev-
eral directions from today’s central business 
district—but it will not reach an emerging 
second central business district, southwest of 
the city, where dense housing developments

BOX O.1  Thinking through policy and investment choices using the World Bank’s 
Urbanization Reviews

Lessons from developed and urbanized countries 
can help rapidly urbanizing ones. Synthesizing such 
lessons was the aim of the 2009 World Develop-
ment  Report:  Reshaping  Economic  Geography 
(World Bank 2008). The report looked at urbaniza-
tion trends and policies worldwide, and it proposed 
a three-part policy framework for urbanization. 
First, institutions should provide the foundations for 
liberalizing the movement of people and goods and 
easing the exchange and redevelopment of land—
enabling vast economic gains. Second, investments 
respond to the needs of residents and businesses, 
especially for basic and connective infrastructure. 
Third, targeted interventions respond to the needs of 
the poor and people in marginal locations or address 
individual behaviors that endanger health, safety, or 
the environment.

Applying the 2009 World Development Report 
policy framework, the World Bank’s Urbanization 
Reviews offer city leaders diagnostic tools to iden-
tify policy distortions and analyze investment priori-

ties. Each review starts by assessing a country’s or 
region’s spatial transformation: how the urban econ-
omy is evolving, how demand for the city is chang-
ing with economic development, the pace of new 
arrivals, and how these new arrivals into the city are 
finding places to live and commuting to their jobs. 
It then compares the city’s observed patterns with 
benchmarks in other places or with past conditions. 
Such comparisons help reveal how policy distortions 
constrain urbanization and how investment short-
falls restrict the benefits from it. Once the review has 
identified the possible constraints and shortfalls, it 
proposes policy options. It aims to show how a city 
can harness economic and social benefits not just 
today, but in the future, as economies grow, tech-
nologies change, and institutions are strengthened.

To test the relevance of the tools and policy frame-
work in different development circumstances, the 
World Bank has piloted the Urbanization Reviews in 
more than 10 countries at varying stages of urban-
ization (see figure BO.1.1): Uganda and Sri Lanka

approach for all countries—but the policy options 
that are explored vary by country in their emphasis, 
reflecting each country’s particular stage of urban-
ization and institutional circumstances.

 (continued)

The country-specific and city-specific diagnos-
tics of the Urbanization Reviews can identify prob-
lems and help formulate policy responses. Although 
the Urbanization Review is not intended to gener-
ate a policy or investment blueprint, it should help 
in identifying and resolving key policy distortions. 
In addition, because diagnostics compare present 
realities with what could be or should be, they imply 

benchmarking—comparing performance against the 
situation in other places, against chosen standards, 
or against known best practices. The Urbanization 
Reviews also draw on the Banks’s Urban and Local 
Government Strategy, “System of Cities: Harnessing 
Urbanization for Growth and Poverty Reduction” 
(World Bank 2010).

called New Urban Zones are already being 
built (map O.1).

Another  example:  the  government  of 
South Africa tried to save money by select-
ing isolated regions, with lower land values, 
as the sites for about 2 million newly built 
subsidized homes. But there was no plan to 

connect these new homes to the job market. 
Many workers now commute in collective 
taxis, which are slow and expensive. The 
roads are not good enough to handle traffic 
efficiently, and several transfers are needed 
to reach dispersed job sites (Bertaud 2009). 
Buses, too, carry workers on commutes that

Here is how a typical day passes for one 
South African worker:

Jones is a limousine driver in Johan-
nesburg . . . he lives three hours away 
from his place of work. He leaves home 
at 5:00 every morning, takes a bus and 
reaches his work place at 8:00. On the 
return, it’s the same story. He leaves 
at 5:00 and reaches home at 8:00. On 
most days the only meal he is able to 
find time for—or even afford, due to 
the high travel cost—is his dinner. He 
sees his little daughter only on Sun-
day, as she is not awake by the time he 
leaves and is asleep by the time he gets 
back. (Personal communication with

Similarly, Colombia’s urban development 
challenges arise from problems of policy and 
planning. One of Latin America’s most decen-
tralized countries, Colombia has more than 
1,000 municipal governments with parallel 
responsibilities—basic infrastructure service 
delivery, land use and economic development, 
and social service provision. Urban areas 
comprise multiple municipalities: Bogotá, for 
example, contains seven. These municipalities 
lack mechanisms to coordinate policy and 
planning across their boundaries. As a result, 
Colombia’s metropolitan areas are crippled 
by inertia—unable to coordinate their land 
use policies, or plan for strategic investments, 
at the metropolitan or regional scale that is 
demanded by a growing urban economy.

Also similar, Uganda’s 1995 constitution 
created private land ownership and abolished 
land leases vested with local urban bodies. 
Local  governments  were  fiscally  starved, 
unable to acquire land or protect rights-of-
way for infrastructure improvement. And 
land transactions generally were hampered by 
poor tenure security (only 18 percent of land 
is registered and titled); by the lack of a cred-
ible system for valuing land; by low incen-
tives for landowners to rent their land; and 
by high entry costs for land development ven-
tures. To remedy the situation, especially in

the metropolis of Kampala, Uganda urgently 
needs a credible system for documenting and 
valuing land. To be sure, local urban bodies 
also need financing support—to buy land 
and pay for infrastructure. But no amount of 
financing alone will solve Uganda’s problems.
The  Republic  of  Korea  can  be  consid-
ered a model of success, where urban plan-
ning and land management institutions have 
evolved to meet challenges at each stage of 
urbanization. Land development programs 
were established first, followed by a land use 
regulation system. Then came comprehensive 
urban planning, with guidelines for manda-
tory 20-year visions, zoning decisions, and 
planning facilities. Downtown development 
projects systematically adhered to phased sce-
narios under the comprehensive plans. Later, 
in the 1990s and 2000s, Korea integrated

separate  laws  regulating  urban  and  non-
urban areas, and in 2000 it instituted met-
ropolitan city–regional planning (between 
the city and the county or province). Mean-
while, the government initiated large-scale 
apartment construction projects that solved 
Korea’s most serious urban housing prob-
lems. Multiple transport modes were devel-
oped. Road projects, over time, have included 
urban highways and pavement projects as 
well as a network of expressways. And the 
nation’s rail network includes urban subway 
lines alongside traditional railroads and high-
speed rail—the bullet trains that have shrunk 
Korea into a half-day travel zone.

Planning, connecting, and financing need 
to be integrated—as they are in this report, 
with chapters 1–3 drawing lessons from pre-
vious and ongoing Urbanization Reviews. In 
addition, chapter 4 presents the plan-connect-
finance framework in action, distilling les-
sons from pilots in seven countries (Brazil, 
China, Colombia, India, Indonesia, Korea, 
and Vietnam), with lessons from each. Inter-
leaved with the chapters are four spotlights 
that apply the framework to ongoing policy 
debates. They discuss slums and natural haz-
ards (spotlight A), infrastructure service pro-
vision (spotlight B), new growth poles and 
urban regeneration (spotlight C), and innova-
tions in municipal finance (spotlight D).

City leaders can use the three-dimensional 
urban development framework and the case 
studies in this report to tailor the analysis 
and identify the impediments to urbaniza-
tion in their cities and countries—assessing 
“where the shoe really pinches.” Then they 
can identify the policy options that are most 
politically, technically, and fiscally feasible. 
What are the specific tasks under planning, 
connecting, and financing that policy makers 
should focus on? Consider three more terms 
that are also commonly used: value, coor-
dinate, and leverage—terms that can help 
sharpen the effectiveness of planning, con-
necting, and financing.

Planning cities
Planning is fundamental to agglomeration 
economies  in  three  ways.  First,  land  use 

requires  effective  systems  for  land  valua-
tion. Second, land use must be allocated in a 
way that allows for infrastructure improve-
ments. Third, the most basic infrastructure 
services—water, energy, sanitation, and solid 
waste management—need to be provided for 
all residents, urban and peri-urban alike.

Value the city’s land by establishing 
systematic and transparent assessment 
Urbanization generates an increase in the 
demand for land, and a problem arises when 
land is scarce in places it is needed the most. 
The  success  of  tools  for  accommodating 
urban expansion and redevelopment is typi-
cally based on robust systems for assessing 
land values. And a clear definition of property 
rights is a first requirement in this direction. 
Further, developed countries rely on various 
forms of data and institutions to assess land 
values, including market data on transac-
tions and attributes of the property, as well as 
ancillary data on potential income from land 
and the cost of inputs into land development. 
These data are managed to provide up-to-
date and reliable information for professional 
appraisers as well as the general public. Insti-
tutions that improve the information foun-
dations of the valuation process, including a 
trained cadre of appraisers in property valu-
ation, contribute to ensuring transparency in 
the valuation process and to making informa-
tion on land values widely accessible.

To establish appraised land values and pre-
vent land-related conflict, city leaders should 
promote valuation processes that are sys-
tematic, professional, and transparent. Con-
sider Korea, which during the 1970s encour-
aged the development of a cadre of property 
appraisers—bringing  transparency  to  the 
valuation process while making information 
on land values widely accessible. In previous 
land acquisitions, market values and asset 
replacement costs had been assessed by local 
government officials. In 1972, the govern-
ment introduced the Basic Land Prices sys-
tem, which mandated the assessment of land 
and buildings by certified private appraisers. 
Estimated property values from two apprais-
ers were averaged for a final value; if the two

O V E R V I E W  

  7

appraisals differed by more than 10 percent, 
a third private appraiser was selected and a 
new average calculated (World Bank 2013).

Although the valuation of land is essential 
to the efficient allocation of land use, many 
developing  countries  lack  institutions  for 
valuing land effectively. In countries where 
land values are concealed to avoid high trans-
action taxes, or are distorted by laws that 
allow developers to acquire land at favorable 
rates, the result is inefficiency: land may not 
be allocated to the best use, high prices may 
lead to affordability problems, and infra-
structure expansion may face delays because 
land  is  not  easily  accessible.  Take  India, 
where such information systems are in their 
infancy and the government often acquires 
land for industrial and infrastructure devel-
opment. Farmers and other landowners are 
compensated with payments benchmarked 
on the stamp duties—a land transaction tax. 
But since the marginal rate for stamp duties 
historically has been as high as 12 percent, 
land  and  property  values  have  long  been 
underreported. Now, as India’s policy makers 
amend the rules for changes in land use, the 
lack of independent and reliable land valua-
tions is likely to generate public discontent 
and related conflicts.

But building these institutions may take 
time, and second-best solutions may help 
countries in the interim as longer-term objec-
tives  are  pursued.  In  India,  for  example, 
while stronger institutions governing land 
use conversion, property rights definition and 
adjudication, and land valuation emerge and 
land markets mature over time, city leaders 
may want to look at alternative options for 
the short and medium term. In India, lead-
ers could explore expanding the use of land 
readjustment3 methods for land assembly and 
infrastructure development in urban areas. 

Coordinate land management with 
infrastructure, natural resources, and 
hazard risk
A  city’s  demand  for  physical  structures, 
infrastructure, housing, and amenities will 
change with time as its population grows. To 
meet new demand, city leaders and planners 

must have strategies that are flexible. Other-
wise their decisions and policies can lock cit-
ies into physical forms that may prove subop-
timal. For example, density limits—though 
important—should  not  impede  economic 
growth or prevent the development of afford-
able urban housing. Bangalore is an example 
of density regulations reducing economic effi-
ciency. Research shows that if the city’s den-
sity restrictions were lifted, its radius would 
be 8 kilometers rather than the present 12, so 
the city would grow in a more compact form. 
Commuting  times  would  shrink,  saving 
households about 4 percent of their income 
through lower transport costs (Bertaud and 
Brueckner 2004). 

Similarly,  land  use  policies  need  to  be 
aligned with infrastructure plans (such as 
plans for public transit). Singapore is a good 
example: densities vary by location, planned 
use,  and  infrastructure  availability  (with 
higher densities near metro stations). New 
York varies densities block by block and by 
planned use—commercial areas in midtown 
and downtown Manhattan have much higher 
densities than do uptown residential areas. 
To fund infrastructure improvements, cities 
can sell developers the right to build at higher 
densities than would otherwise be allowed in 
a given location. Aligning land use and infra-
structure can also help manage the forma-
tion and growth of slums (see spotlight A). 
In Tunisia, the national upgrading program 
has dramatically reduced slum housing from 
23 percent in 1975 to 2 percent in 1995 of 
the overall housing stock. The program was 
successful as national utilities made massive 
investments in water and sewer trunk infra-
structure over the same period, making it pos-
sible to upgrade existing informal settlements.
In thinking about coordinating land use 
policies with infrastructure plans, it is also 
important to consider vulnerability to natu-
ral hazard risks. While 70 percent of high-
income countries integrate land use and nat-
ural risk management, only about 15 percent 
of low-income countries are doing so (World 
Bank 2012b). This is of concern as cities are 
more vulnerable to natural hazards, includ-
ing floods that are becoming more destruc-
tive  in  many  parts  of  the  world.  Equally

important is coordination between land use 
and natural resource management—includ-
ing water resources and water supply (World 
Bank 2012c). Swakopmund, Namibia, a city 
of 42,000 surrounded by environmentally 
sensitive areas, has been able to limit devel-
opment to within the zoned “townlands” 
and has protected watersheds through inte-
grated environmental, sector, and land use 
planning. 

Leverage competitive markets 
alongside regulation to expand basic 
infrastructure
Water, sanitation, transportation, and elec-
tricity are basic services. How can city leaders 
promote their expansion and increase access? 
For certain services—such as trucking—it is 
possible to establish wholly competitive mar-
kets, with free entry to providers and prices 
that reflect demand while covering costs. For 
other services, such as bus transportation and 
garbage removal, the effects of competition 
can be mimicked through recurrent auctions: 
franchises go to the provider who offers the 
lowest price for a given set of performance 
criteria.

Such franchise auctions have succeeded in 
reducing both costs and prices, so they deserve 
serious consideration. In many cities, such as 
Bogotá, London, and Santiago, bus routes are 
auctioned to operators who are then assigned 
to predefined itineraries. In London, since auc-
tions were instituted, operating costs per bus-
kilometer have declined considerably (gross of 
administrative costs by an estimated 20–35 
percent, net of administrative costs by at least 
14 percent) (Estache and Gomez-Lobo 2004). 
Santiago awards five-year contracts using cri-
teria that include the fare offered by the bid-
der, along with performance standards. Before 
the auctions, during a period of deregulation, 
bus fares had risen; with the auctions, the 
fares came back down. 

For still other services, characterized by 
natural monopolies (networks) and public 
good characteristics, such as provision of 
water and sanitation, governments and city 
leaders have to set realistic objectives for 

the  development  of  the  water  supply  and 
sanitation sector, checked against available 
resources  and  agreed  on  in  a  multistake-
holder policy dialogue. Efforts to improve 
the  effectiveness  of  service  delivery  and 
lower capital costs are needed in most cities. 
These efforts may be supported by a range 
of planning tools including strategic financial 
planning, legislative and regulatory reform, 
benchmarking, and performance tools.

In addition, prices may have to be regu-
lated. But to make regulatory regimes work, 
cities need a mechanism to prevent after-the-
fact opportunism—by regulators or by ser-
vice providers. In Latin America, for exam-
ple, providers have renegotiated 55 percent of 
infrastructure concessions in transport and 
75 percent in water and sanitation. 

Finally, price discrimination and subsidies 
can be used to expand access to services such 
as public transportation—for both social 
equity and environmental sustainability. Still, 
city leaders should look first at market struc-
tures that give providers the needed incen-
tives and flexibility to cover costs while serv-
ing as many people as possible.

Connecting cities 
Connections—between cities and within cit-
ies—benefit producers and consumers. They 
give  producers  access  to  input  (including 
labor) and output markets. They give con-
sumers options and, in many cases, better 
prices. And connections expose cities to new 
economic opportunities. But city leaders who 
envision better transport connections for cit-
ies and neighborhoods face difficult choices. 
With limited resources, they cannot invest in 
everything. It is hard to know which new or 
improved connections will yield the highest 
returns over time. 

Setting priorities for connective investment 
means picking winners and losers in the short 
run—but in the long run, thinking about pri-
orities can make a vast difference for cities, 
even countries. To identify the most effective 
additions and improvements to the networks 
connecting cities and neighborhoods, city 
leaders can take the following three steps.

Value the city’s external and 
internal connections
For external connections, compare a city’s 
transport  costs—and  the  density,  quality, 
and capacity of roads, railways, waterways, 
and the like—with data from similar cities. 
In this way, determine where improvement is 
most needed. Alternatively, identify possible 
transport cost reductions and connectivity 
gains that reflect the city’s desired mix of eco-
nomic activities and extent of specialization. 
In Colombia, lowering transport costs along 
the country’s key trade corridors can enhance 
competitiveness—for cities and for the nation. 
For example, transporting freight by road 
from Bogotá to the Atlantic costs about $94 
per ton while maritime transport from the 
Colombian coast to the United States is less, 
at about $75 per ton. High domestic transport 
costs undermine the competitiveness of goods 
produced in Colombia’s largest cities, espe-
cially compared with other large cities around 
the  world.  Reducing  domestic  transport 
costs by 12 percent can lead to an increase in 
exports of about 9 percent (Blyde and Martin-
cus 2011).

For internal connections, find out what 
the problems are: are gridlocks and lack of 
adequate public transport deterring residents 
from working outside their immediate neigh-
borhoods (making labor markets inefficient)? 
Conversely, are long commuting times or 
high fares forcing residents to live in crowded 
slums so that they can walk to work? A city 
that faces one or both of these challenges 
needs a plan for a better transport system, 
including a desired mix of transportation 
modes. The plan must balance two main 
objectives: increasing the supply of affordable 
transport options, and ensuring that conges-
tion and pollution remain within acceptable 
limits.

Coordinate among transport options 
and with land use
From the beginning, city leaders must system-
atically coordinate transport plans with land 
use policies and related infrastructure plans. 

Different  cities  demand  different  modal 
mixes, different neighborhoods demand dif-
ferent modes: mass transport is generally 
suited to compact areas, private vehicles to 
more sprawling ones. 

City  leaders  should  also  seek  ways  to 
reduce  the  gap  between  transport  prices 
and costs—both between cities and within 
them—by inducing competition in trans-
port markets. Not all modes and routes will 
support multiple providers. But where they 
will, and where demand is high enough, pol-
icies and regulations should foster competi-
tion and not create artificial monopolies. At 
the same time, city leaders should find ways 
to price the full cost of individual motor 
vehicle use. These costs include externalities 
from congestion where road users do not 
take account of the time costs they incur on 
other road users (Kopp 2007). Local air pol-
lution imposes additional costs. The expan-
sion of urban areas separates jobs and resi-
dential locations, increasing trip lengths and 
use of motorized transport. The associated 
health costs are high—in Beijing, the health 
costs from local air pollution are estimated 
at $3.5 billion annually (Creutzig and He 
2009).

Finally, city leaders must balance the aim 
of covering transport costs through market 
pricing with other social and environmen-
tal  objectives.  In  Brazil,  the  government 
requires formal sector employers to provide 
transit tickets to their employees through a 
system called vale transporte (transporta-
tion vouchers, VT); the firms then deduct the 
VT expenditures from taxable income. The 
VT system—albeit affecting only the formal 
sector—effectively spreads the cost of trans-
port subsidies between employers and the 
government.

If  city  leaders  were  to  convey  all  the 
external effects of transport to users, mon-
etary costs of transport would increase. This 
would gradually make households and firms 
rebalance their decisions on where to live and 
where to establish business. The result would 
be a denser settlement pattern, higher land 
rents, and shorter transport distances—con-
tributing to the efficiency of cities.

Leverage investments that will yield the 
highest returns for cities—collectively 
and individually
Nationally, leaders must identify the most 
efficient investments in connections among 
all the cities in a country. Where is demand 
highest for the expansion of intercity infra-
structure and transport services? Which cor-
ridors are identified through spatial analy-
sis and simulations as most central to the 
network, in that improving them will yield 
the highest returns—for efficiency and for 
equity? Similarly, leaders must find ways to 
make transport within cities affordable while 
limiting congestion and pollution. Invest-
ments to increase capacity should be com-
bined and aligned with other policies. Tar-
geted subsidies, though not effective for all 
purposes or in all contexts, can sometimes be 
used to make transport more efficient as well 
as more equitable and safer for the environ-
ment. And other fiscal and regulatory tools 
can be used to manage demand for particular 
transport modes.

Financing cities
How do city leaders bridge the gap between 
readily available resources and investment 
needs? What sources should they tap? To 
start with, the government can establish its 
creditworthiness by first securing cash flows 
from user fees and taxes—and by leveraging 
the value of land in several ways, including 
taxes. Only after that can the government 
begin to borrow money and attract private 
investment, making finance easier. Whether 
financing is public or private generally does 
not make the difference between successful 
and struggling cities. But there are at least 
two situations in which private financing 
may be the preferred course: when the gov-
ernment sees public-private partnerships as 
a way to improve efficiency in service provi-
sion, and when the government suffers from 
severe credit constraints that prevent it from 
obtaining credit for improvements to publicly 
run systems.

Value and develop the city’s 
creditworthiness
Without domestic credit markets, and often 
lacking the transparency needed in munici-
pal bond markets, many city governments in 
developing countries cannot access long-term 
credit. Experience shows that subnational debt 
can work if clear regulations are in place to:

•	 Guide	the	issuance	of	debt.
•	 Manage	risks	from	borrowing.
•	 Clearly	set	forth	the	conditions	for	subna-
tional governments to issue debt (includ-
ing the purpose, type, and amount of debt 
that can be issued).4

To make the issuance of debt to cities more 
transparent, Colombia has published traffic-
light ratings of local government payment 
capacity, with red, green, and yellow signals 
reflecting  a  combination  of  liquidity  and 
solvency indicators. To rate municipalities’ 
subnational debt, a red light identifies those 
whose ratio of interest to operational savings 
exceeds 40 percent and whose ratio of debt 
stock to current revenues exceeds 80 per-
cent. Red-light municipalities cannot borrow. 
Green-light municipalities can. Yellow-light 
municipalities can borrow only after obtain-
ing the approval of the central government.

Creditworthiness is limited not only to 
local governments—it extends to their util-
ity companies. In Kenya, the Water Services 
Regulatory Board calculated and published 
utility shadow credit ratings for 43 water 
service providers in 2011 and found only 13 
providers to have investment grade ratings.

Smaller cities can seek short- and medium-
term loans from higher levels of government 
and pool their credit. Thus, governments of 
smaller cities can use bond banks, loan pools, 
and guarantees to reduce lenders’ risks. There 
are two common types of municipal bonds: 
general obligation bonds—debt instruments 
secured by general purpose municipal rev-
enue such as property taxes—and revenue 
bonds—debt instruments secured by the rev-
enue generated from specific municipal assets

  11

(such as ports, toll roads, water and wastewa-
ter utilities), with or without recourse to gen-
eral revenues. Revenue bonds are particularly 
useful in cases where bond markets are not 
well developed. Colombia, India, Malaysia, 
Romania, the Russian Federation, the Slo-
vak Republic, Slovenia, South Africa, and 
the República Bolivariana de Venezuela pro-
vide examples of countries where cities have 
raised funds from municipal bonds.

In the absence of a well-developed bond 
market, financial intermediaries in diverse 
forms  play  important  roles  in  mobilizing 
resources for urban infrastructure financ-
ing.  In  Colombia,  a  successful  financial 
intermediary is FINDETER (Financiera de 
Desarrollo Territorial), a government com-
pany created to finance regional urban infra-
structure projects. More than 90 percent 
owned by the national government, with the 
remainder owned by the regions (Depart-
ments), FINDETER provides resources for 
financial intermediaries who assign them to 
regional authorities. It has received funds 
from multilateral banks and has consistently 
received high credit ratings (Samad, Lozano- 
Gracia, and Panman 2012). Still, none of 
these methods can replace a creditworthy 
local government.

Coordinate public and private finance 
using clear and consistent rules 
When  city  governments  have  constrained 
access to credit, private investors may step in 
to fill the gap. There are many types of part-
nership structures, with each one transferring 
different levels of risk to the private sector. 
They include service contracts, management 
contracts, leases, and privatization. Under 
any of these structures, property rights must 
first be clearly defined, so that creditors need 
not depend on the government’s promises. 
Then a public-private partnership, with pri-
vate sector selection mechanisms based on 
the market and on cost-benefit analyses, can 
improve project selection and ensure project 
sustainability while adding sources of infra-
structure  financing.  Nevertheless,  public- 

private partnerships (PPPs) are no magic bullet: 
they require commitments to sustainable cost-  
covering tariffs or equivalent tax revenues. 
They cannot stand in for good financial man-
agement or good project evaluation. Clear 
rules must dictate the procedures, the require-
ments, the approvals, the institutional respon-
sibilities of the entities involved, and the allo-
cation of risk. 

Consider Ghana, where such rules were 
not in place. In 2002, the government of 
Ghana initiated a process to encourage PPPs 
in the urban water sector. However, lack of 
transparency and accusations of corruption 
in the selection process led to the end of the 
PPP. And in Bolivia, the government priva-
tized the water supply system in the city of 
Cochabamba, awarding a 40-year concession 
to the private consortium, Aguas del Tunari. 
The contract was awarded without adequate 
appraisal of the financial situation of the 
company. Once the concession was awarded, 
rate structures were modified resulting in an 
increase of up to $20 in water bills, repre-
senting as much as 20 percent of incomes for 
local families. Subsequent violent protests led 
to Aguas del Tunari withdrawing from the 
project (Cuttaree 2008; World Bank Institute 
and PPIAF 2012).

In contrast, Chile put in place a clear and 
transparent procurement process, focusing 
on public awareness and a learning-by-doing 
approach that allowed for adjustments along 
the way. This process led to the award of 21 
road projects on a competitive basis between 
1993 and 2001 (Hodge 2006). The bidding 
started with smaller projects in order to test 
the market while also minimizing the risk 
for the private sector. More than 40 Chilean 
and international companies from 10 coun-
tries participated in the bidding through 27 
consortia. 

To successfully implement PPPs, city lead-
ers will have to consider strengthening public 
sector capacity, laying out the appropriate 
legal and sector framework, promoting rig-
orous planning and risk assessment through 
feasibility studies, ensuring transparent and 
competitive procurement, building strong

monitoring systems, and allowing flexibility

methods, and to support and oversee land 
management, land sales, and tax collection.

Leverage existing assets to develop new 
ones, linking both to land use planning
Land sales and leaseholds can provide initial 
capital for new infrastructure investments. 
Sales in Cairo, Istanbul, and Mumbai pro-
vide examples of the revenue potential of 
land auctions. Yet in the long run, govern-
ments must tap own source revenues such as 
property taxes, or similar levies, and access 
long-term credit to fund the maintenance 
and expansion of public facilities. Of special 
interest are three revenue sources—better-
ment levies, special assessment taxes, and 
exactions—that link fees to increases in land 
value based on infrastructure improvements. 
All these ways to leverage state assets require 
the presence of many factors to succeed, and 
all have risks. Strong institutions are essen-
tial to make these instruments work. Insti-
tutions  to  clearly  define  property  rights,

Planning, connecting, and 
financing cities—now
Urbanization in today’s developed countries 
occurred gradually, over a hundred years or 
more. That fairly leisurely pace allowed for 
trial and error in the development of rules 
and capabilities. In contrast, today’s devel-
oping countries face sudden deluges from 
the countryside. Some can expect to go from 
10–20 percent urban population to 60–85 
percent in just 30 years.

Such rapid urbanization confronts devel-
oping  country  governments  with  unprec-
edented institutional and fiscal challenges. 
Managing individual decisions and planning 
for urbanization, today’s cities struggle to 
ensure the availability of shelter, transport, 
and other basic infrastructure and services. 
All are needed by growing populations—and 
they are needed by businesses to start and 
expand.

BOX O.2  Planning, connecting, and financing cities: How the World Bank can help 
city leaders

The World Bank has instruments to help city leaders 
plan, connect, and finance for the future.

Planning. To support evidence-based urban plan-
ning policy at the national and city levels, the World 
Bank can build on:

•	 City	Asset	Management	Strategies	(with	robust	

data collection and dissemination).

•	 Municipal	Contracts	(with	tools	to	capture	multi­

city data, as part of a wholesaling approach).

•	 Subnational	Investment	Climate	Assessments	and	

Doing Business Surveys (with greater coverage).

The Bank can also use the Urbanization Knowledge 
Platform and its Singapore and Marseille Urban 
Hubs to support city leaders with just-in-time advice. 

Connecting.  To  support  improved  connections 
through Development Policy Loans at the subna-
tional level—with its focus on housing and slums, 
land and urban poverty, and urban mobility—the 
Bank can expand programmatic and policy-based 
lending. It is also exploring options for results-based 
programmatic lending linked to core elements of 
planning and connecting cities. 

Financing. To partly cover debt servicing for govern-
ments borrowing from commercial markets (loans 
and bonds) and so improve debt terms, the Bank can 
provide policy-based guarantees—resulting in longer 
maturities, lower interest rates, higher debt limits, 
and the power to tap new markets and institutional 
investors.

For the economy, for equity, and for sus-
tainability,  it  is  therefore  of  the  greatest 
urgency that city leaders plan, connect, and 
finance their cities—now. How decision mak-
ers prepare for rapid urbanization is crucial, 
not only to the future of their cities, but also 
to global economic progress and sustainabil-
ity. The World Bank, among others, can help 
(box O.2).

Notes
1.  These are concerns expressed by more than 
750 city leaders in regional and national con-
sultations on urbanization priorities carried 
out through the Urbanization Knowledge 
Platform—a  global  partnership  for  open-
source knowledge exchange among policy 
makers, practitioners, and researchers. The 
platform included countries ranging from low 
to high income, from the smallest country 
size to the largest.

2.  See Clark (forthcoming) for a discussion on 
who constitutes city leaders and what leader-
ship implies.

3.  Land readjustment is, in essence, a participa-
tory tool used for land assembly and infra-
structure development. In India, it has been 
applied under the name of Town Planning 
Schemes in the State of Gujarat.

4.  This includes national government clearing of 

subnational borrowing.

Planning cities

Cities  thrive  when  people  and  firms 

can benefit from being close together, 
creating  agglomeration  economies. 
But  this  beneficial  transformation  can  be 
thwarted by policies that stymie development 
in urban areas. One obstacle arising from bad 
policy is inefficiency in the use and exchange 
of  land.  Another  is  a  lack  of  coordination 
between  land  use  and  infrastructure  plan-
ning.  To  overcome  these  obstacles  requires 
three sets of policies:

•	 Value	the	city’s	land	by	establishing	sys-
tematic	 and	 transparent	 assessment. 
Because land use shapes a city’s spatial 
structure, cities need policies that clearly 
define property rights and determine land 
values. With such policies in place, urban 
land  markets  help  to  mediate  between 
demand and supply, increasing land utili-
zation and optimizing the development of 
constructed floor area. 

•	 Coordinate	land	management	with	infra-
structure,	natural	resources,	and	hazard	
risk. Cities need policies to govern the 
intensity of land use and to manage its 
integration with infrastructure develop-
ment—especially transport. 

•	 Leverage	competitive	markets	alongside	
regulation	to	expand	basic	infrastructure. 

Cities need policies for the provision of 
public goods and basic infrastructure ser-
vices (water, sanitation, and solid waste 
management). In developing countries, 
access to these services tends to be espe-
cially  low  in  smaller  cities  and  on  the 
fringes of metropolitan cities.

Value the city’s land by 
establishing systematic and 
transparent assessment 
The  use  and  reuse  of  land  is  central  to  a 
city’s expansion and development. For eco-
nomic efficiency, land should be able to shift 
among various uses—though public inter-
vention may be required to offset market 
failures (Henderson and Wang 2007). Urban 
land markets should efficiently allocate land 
between urban and rural uses (with incen-
tives to conserve farmland and green space) 
and within urban areas (to prevent disordered 
land use and underserved neighborhoods).

What is the key to efficient land use? The 
answer is the price of land. Developed coun-
tries determine the price and value of land by 
examining property attributes and market 
data from transactions. Developing countries 
cannot do this so long as they lack certain 
basic institutions, as well as ancillary data

concerning potential income from land, and 
the cost of inputs into land development. 
These data are managed to provide up-to-
date and reliable information for professional 
appraisers as well as the general public. Con-
sider the Republic of Korea, which during the 
1970s encouraged the development of a cadre 
of property appraisers—bringing transpar-
ency to the valuation process while making 
information on land values widely acces-
sible. In previous land acquisitions, market 
values and asset replacement costs had been 
assessed by local government officials. In 
1972, the government introduced the Basic 
Land  Prices  system,  which  mandated  the 
assessment of land and buildings by certified 
private appraisers. Estimated property values 
from two appraisers were averaged for a final 
value; if the two appraisals differed by more 
than 10 percent, a third private appraiser was 
selected and a new average calculated (World 
Bank 2013). 

Many developing countries often lack the 
systems to record and manage this informa-
tion. Transaction data, for instance, may not 
reflect the true price of land because of infor-
mal market transactions to save on duties or 
heavy public subsidies on housing and land 
use. Land registries are often archaic and 
lack the dynamic functionality that allows 
them  to  be  searched  or  updated  quickly. 
These deficient features in transaction record 
management translate to a dearth of data on 
real estate prices, preventing analysis that is 
critical for land value appraisal. The impli-
cations of this bear heavily on local financ-
ing mechanisms involving real estate and 
infrastructure.

Land valuation is integral to local revenue 
generation since land values form the basis 
for activities such as property tax collection 
and land sales or leases. A credible system 
that helps “discover” and “disseminate” the 
value of land makes it difficult for buyers to 
defraud existing landowners. In the absence 
of such information, there is considerable 
scope for undervaluation of land during the 
acquisition process.

Take India, where such information sys-
tems are in their infancy and the government 

often acquires land for industrial and infra-
structure development. Farmers and other 
landowners are compensated with payments 
benchmarked on the stamp duties—a land 
transaction tax. But since the marginal rate 
for  stamp  duties  historically  has  been  as 
high as 12 percent, land and property values 
have long been underreported (World Bank 
2013).1 Now, as India’s policy makers amend 
the rules for changes in land use, the lack of 
independent and reliable land valuations is 
likely to result in public discontent and con-
flicts over land.

In Vietnam, too, official land prices fail to 
reflect demand. The country has two kinds 
of prices for land transactions. First, there 
is the market price—the higher of the two. 
Then  there  is  the  imposed  land  price—a 
much lower value, used by the government in 
acquiring land and allocating it to developers 
and investors (World Bank 2011f). Such an 
inequitable system generates resentment over 
land  acquisitions:  over  1996–2005,  there 
were more than 12,000 complaints. And con-
flicts over land, in turn, hinder the consolida-
tion of plots for industrial development. More 
than 85 percent of available plots in Vietnam 
are smaller than 20 hectares—but industrial 
parks and districts typically need 150–200 
hectares of contiguous land (figure 1.1). So 
the country’s two-price system impedes effi-
ciency and economic development.

In countries that have created success-
ful industrial parks, these areas are much 
larger. An example is Shenzhen, China—the 
most thriving special economic zone in the 
country, and among the world’s most suc-
cessful examples of an integrated growth 
center and magnet for foreign investment. 
In 2005, Shenzhen comprised more than 
70,000 hectares (Lei and Bin 2008). And in 
Indonesia, which has deconcentrated indus-
trial activities out of the cores of Jakarta and 
Surabaya, industrial districts range from 
500–800 hectares (World Bank 2011b).

City leaders in Bogotá recently pioneered 
the improvement of land valuation. Between 
2008 and 2010, the city updated its cadastral 
database, revaluing the 2.1 million properties 
it contains—generating a new revenue stream

of $171 million annually (Ruiz and Vallejo 
2010). To complete the cadastral update, the 
government introduced information tech-
nology,  consulted  with  stakeholders,  and 
began estimating property values using spa-
tially detailed information from geographic 
information  systems  (GIS)  (Uribe  2010). 
Since no property transaction information 
was available, a team of expert appraisers 
collected price data using a combination of 
approaches to yield an appraised value. But 
to keep property taxes progressive—and to 
avoid resistance from property owners—the 
city imposed a cap on property tax increases. 
Similarly, it is generally recognized in the 
United States that tax assessors’ calculation 
of property value is about 33 percent lower 
than market value.

tion economies and hard for governments to

to  suitable  land  (zoned  and  serviced  for 
industry) as a major business constraint. And 
in India, about one in two firms reports that 
its greatest business development challenge is 
to obtain land in its desired industrial zone.2 
In South Asia, it takes 100 days to lease pub-
lic land for industrial purposes—the longest 
wait worldwide (figure 1.2). (In high-income 
Organisation for Economic Co-operation 
and Development countries it takes just 26 
days.)

In accommodating industry, infrastruc-
ture, and urban development, city leaders 
should first think about improving their insti-
tutions for land information and valuation. 
They can do so by:

•	 Training	a	cadre	of	appraisers	in	property	

valuation.

•	 Ensuring	transparency	in	the	valuation	

process.

•	 Making	information	on	land	values	widely	

accessible.

So  long  as  institutions  cannot  consis-
tently and accurately discover and dissemi-
nate land values, signals to developers and

entre preneurs will be weak—and tensions 
with landowners will rise. To enable the gov-
ernment—as well as other interested private 
parties—to value land correctly is to lay the 
bedrock  for  complementary  policies  and 
investments.

Coordinate land management 
with infrastructure, natural 
resources, and hazard risk 
to reflect market needs and 
societal preferences
Linked to the functioning of a city’s land 
markets is its demand for physical structures, 
infrastructure, housing, and amenities. That 
demand will change over time, requiring city 
leaders and planners to adapt.

Once the physical structures of a city have 
been built, though, they are generally fixed 
for a long time. Urban structures typically 
survive for more than 100 years—buildings 
and housing from 20 to 150 years, transport 
infrastructure from 30 to 200 years (Halle-
gatte 2009). Such structures will determine 
how the city’s land can be used and reused, 
dictating whether the urban economy can 
take full advantage of agglomeration and can 
contribute to social equity and environment 
sustainability (box 1.1).

City leaders, therefore, must make careful 
decisions about their cities’ physical struc-
tures  today—to  avoid  locking  them  into 
physical forms that will be regretted tomor-
row. City leaders often are vexed with two 
different but interrelated problems. First, 
they need to accommodate new demographic 
and economic growth, and this may best be 
located on “greenfield” areas that are not 
urbanized. And second, they need to revi-
talize and reorient their cities to modernize 
them, making them more attractive to busi-
nesses and residents. Additionally, a global 
survey of cities indicates that population 
densities are falling and that, as the develop-
ing country cities continue to grow, they will 
require much more land. Therefore, many 
cities are exploring how to manage their 
densities so that they can minimize urban 
sprawl.

Managing densities
Land use planning does much to determine 
urban density, which in turn drives much 
of the demand for urban infrastructure and 
largely determines a city’s functional effi-
ciency (Levy 2011). Density regulations—one 
of the tools used most frequently by urban 
planners—cap the quantity of property that 
can be developed on a plot of land. Such a 
cap is often called the floor space index (FSI) 
or floor area ratio (FAR). So, for example, if 
the FSI in an area of a city is 1:1, it means 
that developers can only build a building 
whose total floor space on the parcel is less 
than or equal to the total plot area. While 
in some cases it may be possible to build a 
one-story building on a plot that entirely cov-
ers the plot, and therefore achieves an FSI of 
1:1, developers will typically build a building 
with a “footprint” or “plinth” that covers 
less than 100 percent of the site, but they will 
build more than a one-story structure. For 
example, a developer could cover 25 percent 
of a plot and build a four-story building and 
still meet the FSI regulation of 1:1. 

Other planning regulations include set-
backs (minimum distances to the front, rear, 
and sides of a plot) and maximum building 
heights. Both are designed to protect adjacent 
properties and preserve access to sun, air, 
and open space (parks and plazas). Finally, 
plot coverage ratio regulations limit the total 
area of a plot that can be developed (Dowall 
2012; World Bank 2013). It is very impor-
tant to highlight that there is no such thing 
as an optimal FSI. The “right” FSI for a spe-
cific area will depend on the existing spatial 
structure of the city, the street patterns and 
widths, the level of infrastructure (is there 
enough capacity to accommodate higher den-
sity—higher FSIs?), and cultural and social 
factors (are skyscrapers acceptable?) (Bertaud 
2004). 

Although these regulations exist for good 
reasons, they often have unintended con-
sequences. If an area’s FSI is set far below 
the level at which investors might otherwise 
develop it (assuming an unregulated market), 
this repression of supply can push people out

BOX 1.1  Greening city growth: Coordinating land use and infrastructure planning

Urban development decisions are long-lived. As such, 
they create substantial inertia in socioeconomic sys-
tems. Because the economic system reorganizes itself 
around infrastructure and urban plans, and because 
so much of current growth is in cities, this inertia 
can extend over centuries. A delay in greening city 
investments may therefore prove costly if it results in 
a lock-in into technologies that turn out to no longer 
be appropriate (because of their excessive carbon, 
land, or water intensity) or settlement patterns that 
prove vulnerable to changing climatic conditions. 

Developing  countries,  which  still  face  a  huge 
transport  infrastructure  gap,  have  the  opportu-
nity to choose their urban forms and their trans-
port development path: low-emission transport or 
car-dependent transport. Experience suggests that 
demand for car ownership increases dramatically at 
annual household incomes of $6,000–$8,000. If his-
tory repeats itself, an additional 2.3 billion cars will 
be added by 2050, mostly in developing countries, 
given expected economic growth and past patterns of 
motorization (Chamon, Mauro, and Okawa 2008). 
Without policies to encourage high-density urban-
ization and public transport, high reliance on indi-
vidual car transport will ensue. Consequences would 
include high congestion—costly in energy expendi-
ture and time lost—and local pollution with signifi-
cant health impacts.

But if public transport is included as a major part 
of modal structure in urban transport, there is no 
conflict between a low-emission transport sector 
and rapid growth or high income. In fact, economies 
with some of the lowest ratios of energy consump-
tion to GDP in the world—including Hong Kong 
SAR, China; Japan; and Singapore—have experi-
enced extraordinary development over the past few 
decades. Curitiba and Copenhagen are two examples 
of where the reliance on cars is lower than average:

•	 The  city  of  Curitiba  shows  that  coordinating 
urban transport with planning—to concentrate 
population around public transportation lines and 
hubs—makes it possible to maximize the share of 

trips done with low-energy-consumption modes 
(Suzuki, Cervero, and Iuchi 2013). 

•	 The	city	of	Copenhagen	was	designed	following	a	
transit-oriented and bike-friendly approach: start-
ing from a “finger plan”—the identification of few 
priority development areas—then investing in five-
axis transit radials and corridors of satellite, rail-
served new towns (Cervero 1998).

But in most world cities, the decrease in the rela-
tive price of transport by individual car—due to 
income growth and improved car energy efficiency—
has led to decreasing density, increasing sprawl, and 
rising dependency on individual vehicles. 

The consequence of the inertia in urban develop-
ment is an enormous potential for regret if decisions 
are made without adequate consideration of how 
conditions—socioeconomic,  environmental,  and 
technological—will change over time. The potential 
for regret has always been a challenge for policies 
with long-term implications, but it has been height-
ened by climate change and the volatility in energy 
prices. Avoiding these lock-ins—and the correspond-
ing regret or retrofitting costs—should be a priority 
for making decisions on urban planning and urban 
infrastructure. 

Of course, building better (cleaner, more resilient, 
or both) can be more expensive. This tradeoff raises 
the fear that countries faced with severe financing 
constraints may need to choose between “building 
right” (which may make both economic and envi-
ronmental sense) and “building more” (which may 
be what is required socially). But the additional cost 
of building greener cities should not be overstated: 
in the urban sector, the additional cost to build with 
higher density and with lower energy building—
thanks to better insulation and more efficient heat-
ing systems—is limited and provides multiple cobe-
nefits, making this domain a priority for immediate 
action (Viguie and Hallegatte 2012).

to other areas—and the increased demand 
for those other areas can raise prices across 
the city (Annez and Linn 2010). Similarly, 
if the FSI is a uniform limit, it may increase 

housing prices by limiting the supply of land 
that would otherwise be built up. It may also 
encourage the allocation of land and build-
ings to less productive uses. Beyond slowing 

20

city growth in these ways, a uniform limit 
can also push poor households to distant 
suburbs, adding to their poverty by increas-
ing their commuting costs and times. When 
households  have  no  choice  but  to  locate 
themselves near jobs, they often join hazard-
prone informal settlements (see spotlight A).
Bangalore is an example of density regu-
lations reducing economic efficiency. Its FAR 
is between 1.75 and 3.25, well below the 
typical range (most large cities around the 
world have a FAR between 5 and 15). The 
result? Research shows that if the city’s den-
sity restrictions were lifted, its radius would 
be 8 kilometers rather than the present 12. 
Commuting  times  would  shrink,  saving 
households about 4 percent of their income 
through lower transport costs (Bertaud and 
Brueckner 2004).

By contrast, developers in Bangkok’s less 
restricted land markets were able to adapt to 
growing demographic and economic pres-
sures and climbing costs. Over 1974–88, 
when growth was rapid and land and housing 
construction prices were on the rise, develop-
ers responded by increasing the density of 
their housing projects. The average number 
of units per hectare rose from 35 to 56, and 
multifamily housing increased from less than 
2 percent of new construction in 1986 to 
43 percent in 1990. Such shifts allowed the 
developers to build affordable housing profit-
ably (Dowall 1992). Over 1986–90, almost 
half the growth in Bangkok housing stock 
was from private development, while infor-
mally produced housing composed a mere 
3 percent of the total. In other cities with 
highly constrained land markets, informally 
produced housing composed 20–80 percent 
of the total (Dowall 1998).

To effectively shape the space, density, and 
land use pattern of a city or metropolitan 
area, planners can work with a master plan 
and structure plan to prepare detailed dis-
trict plans. They can draft zoning ordinances 
to aid the plans’ implementation. And they 
can prepare FSI or FAR regulations to limit 
building density (Dowall 2012). Such density 
regulations can simultaneously be coordi-
nated with infrastructure plans. 

In  addition  to  density  regulations, 
enforcement of land use plans becomes a 
challenge when local governments do not 
have the administrative capacity to monitor 
and facilitate growth of new settlements. In 
Dakar, the fastest population growth in the 
metropolitan region over the past 20 years 
took place in peri-urban areas as they pro-
vide cheap and readily available land for set-
tlement. However, 40 percent of the popula-
tion growth in these areas occurred on land 
in precarious areas—with the risk exacer-
bated by lack of planning standards and of 
adequate infrastructure (Pelling 2003). The 
physical vulnerability and risk in these peri-
urban areas is compounded by their weak 
institutional capacity.

Coordinating land use and 
infrastructure planning
A central problem of urban planning is that 
of matching land use and infrastructure for 
the best possible outcome. Higher densities 
generate greater need for infrastructure ser-
vices (electricity, water, and waste water). 
But they also support environmental sustain-
ability in being better suited to public trans-
port. To be sure, density must not overwhelm 
infrastructure. Yet it is equally important 
not to underuse infrastructure, imposing low 
density caps where infrastructure can sup-
port higher ones.

To see what is at stake, compare Manhat-
tan—New York City’s archetypal borough—
with Mumbai (map 1.1). Manhattan’s density 
zones are typically small. Its restrictions on 
land use vary with street width and capacity, 
with infrastructure capacity, and with his-
torical land use patterns (commercial office 
districts typically have higher FSIs than resi-
dential districts). This granularity helps to 
make Manhattan a good example of integra-
tion between land use and infrastructure.

In contrast, Mumbai’s density zones are 
large—uniform across much of the city—and 
generally low. India’s urban planners jus-
tify such low formal densities as necessary 
to avoid overburdening existing infrastruc-
ture, which is severely limited. Rather than

Note: In some zones, the floor space index (FSI) might be increased up to two additional units because of bonuses due to plaza, arcades, and the like. In some areas, the permitted FSI 
might not be reached because of setbacks and plot geometry.

increase formal or planned densities, they 
have tried to preserve urban areas by push-
ing development out to new towns and sub-
urban industrial estates (World Bank 2013). 
But this strategy ignores an opportunity: 
India’s cities could instead use rising land val-
ues to finance better, higher-capacity infra-
structure, to increase office space and to add 
affordable housing for low- and moderate-
income groups.

Central business districts, and other eco-
nomically dynamic areas of cities, normally 
have the highest FSIs. Being well connected 
to public transit, they can accommodate large 
daytime populations. But outlying areas adja-
cent to transit stations—or at major highway 
intersections—are also given high FSIs by 

planners who seek to increase transit use and 
discourage private motor vehicles. Because 
a city’s transport choices can generate both 
positive and negative externalities as the city 
grows, transport is best addressed as part of 
an integrated urban strategy that can cater to 
various user groups and anticipate long-term 
needs. In too many cities, such a strategy has 
been lacking (World Bank 2002; World Bank 
2012a).

Consider Hanoi, where mass transport 
investments failed to anticipate rising den-
sities. The city expects to complete the first 
phase of its urban mass rapid transit plan 
by 2020, meaning that the network and 25 
stations will be built (map 1.2, with stations 
marked in green). In 2009, more than one of

subjecting land use to economic principles of 
efficiency.

In two São Paulo localities, Faria Lima 
and  Agua  Espraiada,  revenues  from  the 
sale of additional building rights have been 
increasing  (figure  1.3).  The  revenues  are 
deposited in a common Urban Development 
Fund  (FUNDURB) that carries out projects 
defined in the master plan of 2002. So far, 
most of the revenues have been allocated in 
two ways: to drainage and sanitation works, 
and to housing and support for land ten-
ure regularization. A large share of funded 
improvements is located in the city fringe, 
implying a redistribution of funds through-
out  São  Paulo:  revenues  collected  in  the 
most dynamic areas are invested in the most 
deprived, peripheral areas. 

Leverage competitive markets 
alongside regulation to expand 
basic infrastructure
City leaders need systems for valuing land, 
and they need land use plans that are coor-
dinated with infrastructure plans. But they 
also need ways to promote the expansion of 
urban infrastructure services. The urgency 
of this need appears in figure 1.4, showing 
access to piped water for urban residents in

five residents lived within walking distance 
of a planned transit station. Yet new devel-
opments are now increasing the density of 
the population along the Pham Hung road 
in southwest Hanoi—an area that the first 
phase of the transit network will not serve. 
As a result, in 2020 a large share of Hanoi’s 
population will be disconnected from the rest 
of the city.

Cities can use their control over densities 
to pay for infrastructure, as São Paulo did 
when it set new rules that integrated land 
management with infrastructure provision. 
To balance efficiency with equity, when the 
city redefined allowable development den-
sities,  it  imposed  a  charge  for  additional 
building rights even as it capped each area’s 
land supply (World Bank 2011c). The charge

Brazil, Colombia, India, Uganda, and Viet-
nam. In each of these five pilot countries for 
the World Bank’s Urbanization Reviews (see 
box O.1 in the overview), water access varies 

with city size—but it does so differently. In 
Vietnam, access is high but less equitable, 
with smaller cities showing lower access. In 
Brazil and Colombia, service coverage is high

and fairly equitable. In India and Uganda, 
access is lower and less equitable.

How to increase access to basic infrastruc-
ture services? In most infrastructure services, 
such as transport, electricity, and telecommu-
nications, a useful question for city leaders 
is whether there is a framework of clear and 
consistent rules for service delivery. Three 
approaches merit consideration:

•	 Harness	market	forces, either by allowing 
free competition among providers or by 
auctioning service franchises (mimicking 
the effects of competitive pricing through 
recurrent auctions).

•	 Regulate	prices, with mechanisms to insu-
late the regulators from political influence 
by the regulated firms.

•	 Establish	subsidies, primarily to expand 
access, when there is no way for prices 
to  cover  the  costs  of  equitable  service 
provision.

For services such as water supply and sani-
tation, the first order considerations are for 
national governments and city leaders to set 
realistic objectives for the development of the 
water supply and sanitation sector, checked 
against available resources and agreed on in a 
multistakeholder policy dialogue; to address 
the governance issues particularly regarding 
to accountability and public participation; 
and to address the coordination challenges 
across sectors and space.

Harnessing market forces
In  basic  infrastructure,  as  in  other  mar-
kets, prices ideally should cover costs. Why? 
Because cost-covering prices are likely to be 
a city’s strongest protection against wasteful 
investments and consumption.

When  policy  makers  inform  potential 
providers that they will not receive any fis-
cal transfers or subsidies—but that regula-
tion will allow pricing to cover costs in the 
aggregate—then providers estimate demand 
and calibrate it against costs, just as investors 
in any market would do. Whether the pro-
viders are publicly or privately owned makes 

no difference: they understand that they will 
make money only if customers are able and 
willing to pay the required price. 

Can market forces indeed be harnessed—
to make basic infrastructure service provi-
sion more efficient, to expand access to ser-
vices, or both (Klein 2012)? Head-to-head 
competition is feasible in principle for certain 
sectors: electricity, natural gas, transport, 
water, and waste management, though the 
sectors with large expensive networks (elec-
tricity, natural gas, rail transport, and water) 
require elaborate regulation to let service 
providers share networks.3 Even where only 
monopolies are feasible, periodic franchise 
auctioning can mimic the effects of competi-
tive pricing. However, when large expensive 
network infrastructure is required, auction-
ing may be less efficient. 

Opportunities to allow free competition
Telecommunications is the most prominent 
example of a competitive infrastructure mar-
ket. Others are possible, however.

•	 In	electricity,	some	competition	may	be	 
feasible  among  generators,  as  well  as 
among energy traders and sellers in larger 
systems. Hong Kong SAR, China, even 
left residential prices unregulated until a 
few years ago. In natural gas, there can 
be effective competition from competing 
fuels such as fuel oil. Some systems, such 
as Germany’s, have left prices unregulated 
and allowed entry into the pipeline busi-
ness. However, typically duplication of 
pipelines or creation of a number of adja-
cent networks with different owners is not 
economically optimal. 

•	 In	transport,	various	forms	of	head-to-
head competition are possible. Bus and 
truck  companies  can  compete  freely. 
Ports, or airports, can compete if they are 
not separated too widely. And freight rail 
firms may face effective competition from 
road transport over large distances. In 
water supply, there may be head-to-head 
competition. But in most cases, compe-
tition  between  household  connections 
and stand-posts, and alternatives such as 

P L A N N I N G ,   C O N N E C T I N G ,   A N D   F I N A N C I N G   C I T I E S — N O W

unprotected springs or private wells, may 
in fact suggest affordability issues or cop-
ing strategies to overcome poor infrastruc-
ture services. 

In some urban services, free market entry is 
undesirable, because the resulting competition 
can undermine safety standards. The “penny 
wars” of Bogotá are an interesting exam-
ple. Before a bus rapid transit system called 
TransMilenio was introduced in 2000, about 
30,000–35,000 buses were operating in the 
city (Hook 2005). The government granted 
nonexclusive permits to the route operators, 
with whom bus owners were affiliated. The 
bus owners in turn charged their drivers fixed 
rents. The drivers’ revenue thus depended 
directly on how many fares they collected 
(World Bank 2008). Cutthroat competition 
ensued, with unsafe results: drivers had a 
strong incentive to speed, cut people off, and 
carry too many passengers. The introduction 
of TransMilenio, together with a new regu-
latory framework, eliminated these “penny 
wars.” The new framework included bid-
ding for all parts of the service, from routes 
to infrastructure. TransMilenio allocates the 
market to operators according to their qual-
ity, among other factors—and it pays them 
by the kilometer, assuring them of a certain 
amount regardless of their passenger load. 

Head-to-head competition may also be 
technically unfeasible in sectors that natu-
rally favor monopolies. Much of a city’s net-
worked infrastructure falls in this category: 
its duplication tends to be inefficient. A single 
network, fully built out, can often underbid 
any competitor.4 

Canada’s cities are one example of a natu-
ral monopoly superseding market competi-
tion. Water utilities would at first compete to 
supply firms and households in a given mar-
ket by laying separate pipelines. Then all the 
providers but one would fade away. In other 
cases, a monopoly provider started and was 
not challenged, either because competitors 
could not undercut it or because entry was 
forbidden by law. Natural monopolies can 
also appear in exclusive locations, such as 
airports and central metro stations.

Yet monopolies can abuse their market 
power, charging prices that are too high to 
be socially acceptable. Such prices can also 
make  economies  less  productive  and  less 
competitive. So how can policy allow prices 
to cover costs—while ensuring that prices 
stay close to costs, as opposed to fattening a 
monopoly with excessive profits?

Auctioning service franchises
Regulation can closely mimic the effects of 
competitive pricing even where monopolies 
exist. City leaders can auction the right to 
provide a service for a certain period—mov-
ing  away  from  a  monopolistic  price,  and 
closer to that which would arise from com-
petition. Firms that lose at auction exit the 
particular market. If it is possible to put such 
a monopoly franchise up for auction fairly 
frequently based on the lowest price, the auc-
tions will act like a market to set prices.

Many cities auction bus routes, assigning 
operators to predefined itineraries. Examples 
include Santiago, Bogotá, and London. San-
tiago awards five-year contracts using criteria 
that include the fare offered by the bidder, 
along with quality variables. Before the auc-
tions, during a period of deregulation, bus 
fares had risen; with the auctions, the fares 
came back down. In London, since auctions 
were  instituted,  operating  costs  per  bus-
kilometer have declined considerably (gross 
administrative costs by an estimated 20–35 
percent, net administrative costs by at least 
14 percent) (Estache and Gomez-Lobo 2004).
Where  possible,  franchise  auctions 
repeated at intervals of one to three years 
can make price regulation essentially unnec-
essary. Such auctions have been used, not 
only in bus transport, but also in waste man-
agement.  If  a  company  loses  a  franchise, 
its assets—buses, garbage trucks—can be 
deployed elsewhere.

Regulating prices
Where  free  entry  and  auctions  are  both 
impractical because of a natural monopoly 
involving fixed assets in a service area, price 
regulation is needed.5 For example, it would 

26 

  P L A N N I N G   C I T I E S  

P L A N N I N G ,   C O N N E C T I N G ,   A N D   F I N A N C I N G   C I T I E S — N O W

be absurd for water providers to remove and 
replace pipelines after every auction. Nor can 
such fixed assets be included in the auctions. 
For an auction to determine the price of a 
service, the bidder needs to know the price 
of the assets. And since assets in the ground 
have negligible market value outside the fran-
chise area, their value depends on the price 
that the provider can charge—which is what 
the auction was supposed to determine. Fix-
ing the asset price before the auction would 
be tantamount to direct regulation of prices.
In regulating prices for basic infrastruc-
ture  services,  the  government  typically 
announces a regulatory regime for private 
or state-owned providers.6 Only after firms 
invest does the actual demand become clear. 
The firms then operate the system to meet 
demand. Finally, the regulator rules on the 
revenue that firms can make.

The problem: private providers know that 
in the last stage of this process—revenue cap-
ping—the regulator can renege on the pric-
ing rules announced at first. Such reversals 
are likely when regulators are under pres-
sure to lower consumer prices or to reduce 
profits deemed too large. Even in countries 
with strong legal systems and long regulatory 
traditions, regulators can be strongly pres-
sured to renege on initially announced pric-
ing rules. In a few parts of the United States 
where utility regulators are publicly elected, 
demands to curb prices tend to undermine 
service provision.

Another problem follows: providers try to 
renegotiate contracts shortly after the con-
tracts are awarded. In Latin America, provid-
ers have renegotiated 55 percent of infrastruc-
ture concessions in transport and 75 percent 
in water and sanitation. The high incidence 
suggests that this is opportunism—not merely 
an  attempt  to  compensate  for  incomplete 
information in concession contracts. What 
should be decided through a competitive auc-
tion is opportunistically dictated through 
a bilateral negotiation in which the govern-
ment, however, lacks power. The benefits of 
competition thus vanish (Guasch 2004).

In  short,  wherever  the  regulatory  pro-
cess is rife with political risk, both private 

and state-owned firms will underinvest in 
basic infrastructure provision. Moreover, 
firms that win infrastructure contracts will 
be tempted to renegotiate them. So to make 
regulatory regimes work, cities need a mech-
anism to prevent after-the-fact opportun-
ism—either by regulators or by the service 
providers. Such a mechanism has three parts:

•	 The	design	of	the	pricing	rules.
•	 The	legal	framework	under	which	rules	

are made and administered.

•	 The	 organizational	 arrangements	 for	

administering the rules.

The design of pricing rules
For prices to cover costs while giving firms 
an incentive to expand coverage and pro-
vide high-quality service, the costs must be 
calculated—and  the  prices  must  allow  a 
rate of return. The danger of after-the-fact 
expropriation is highest when the regula-
tor imposes a price cap, such as those used 
in the United Kingdom. Although price caps 
were meant to give firms an incentive to per-
form efficiently—allowing them to profit by 
serving customers well at a lower cost than 
expected—their profits, once made, were 
attacked as “too high.” Furthermore, caps 
decouple infrastructure prices from utiliza-
tion. Even when demand is low, the regulated 
price will reflect the cost of both used and 
unused capacity. At such times, regulators 
may feel pressure to reduce revenues.

Providers have a smaller incentive for effi-
ciency—but may be more willing to invest—
when the rate of return is regulated, as in the 
United States. Profits, rather than prices, are 
capped after the fact. Regulators can vary 
this cap, allowing less profit when demand is 
low and more when demand is high, to make 
revenues more closely reflect utilization (an 
instance of the “used and useful” doctrine7). 
An advantage of these typical U.S. arrange-
ments  is  that  they  reduce  the  regulator’s 
incentive to renege. This greater reliability 
makes investors more likely to put their capi-
tal into infrastructure expansion projects, 
even though prices may fail to cover costs 
during times of low demand.8

In  cities  in  developing  countries,  basic 
infrastructure service prices regularly fail to 
cover the providers’ costs. In some of India’s 
largest cities, the cost of water provision, 
on average, exceeds revenues from use (fig-
ure 1.5). Of the 20 cities in figure 1.5, only 8 
do not recover their operating costs for water 
supply  and  sanitation  through  fees.  As  a 
result, India’s urban water sector can survive 
only on large operating subsidies and capital 
grants from the States.

In sum, excessively low price caps reduce 
the incentives for infrastructure providers 
to expand coverage. They also put utilities 
under financial stress—enough to harm ser-
vice quality.

The legal and contractual framework
Any pricing rule will be laid down in a legal 
document. But the commitment value of legal 
arrangements varies across countries. Inves-
tors seeking protection from potentially arbi-
trary regulators may prefer contracts that are 
subject to court supervision—or even regula-
tions enshrined in the law, which can be hard 
to change.9 Generally, a regulatory regime’s 
most prudent legal form will depend on the 
quality of the institutions that safeguard and 
administer it. 

Governance challenges
Usually	there is a tradeoff between contrac-
tual commitment and flexibility (since regu-
lations may require adjustment to unforeseen 
circumstances). Managing this tradeoff is the 
key challenge for the designers of a regulatory 
institution. Typically they seek mechanisms 
to protect the regulatory body from undue 
political influence by regulated firms—while 
giving the regulator some leeway in the appli-
cation of rules. 

A lack of transparency in policy and plan-
ning and a lack of quality and integrity in 
decision making may be called the account-
ability gap (OECD 2012). This is an issue 
for both public and private service provision, 
although the specific characteristics of the 
issues depend on whether it is public or pri-
vate service provision. Improved monitoring 
of outcomes, enhanced use of benchmarking,

and increased public awareness, concern, 
and involvement could all contribute to bet-
ter planning and implementation of infra-
structure service provision. In addition, for 
private sector service provision, a transpar-
ent process of awards and contract provi-
sions including, as mentioned above, barriers 
to revise contract provisions ex post are all 
key components of effective infrastructure 
provision  planning  (box 1.2).  Key  gover-
nance challenges include: coordinating the 
service delivery level and financing decisions, 
addressing the accountability gap, and coor-
dinating across sectors and space.

BOX 1.2  Successful policy reform in Armenia is based on a well-defined policy 
framework, clear service-level targets, and incentives for public private participation

In 1995 when a local self-governance system was cre-
ated in Armenia, the responsibility for water supply 
and sanitation was delegated to municipalities. But 
most of them did not have the necessary organiza-
tional and financial capacities to manage water supply 
and sanitation services, especially small municipalities. 
Systems were in disrepair and despite an abundance of 
water in the country for almost all Armenians, water 
was available for only a few hours a day.

In response to these challenges, a policy frame-
work has been created with the support of the World 
Bank. This includes a revised legal and regulatory 
framework, the establishment of four water opera-

tors at the regional level, the use of Yerevan Water at 
the municipal level for 80 percent of the population, 
public-private participation with increasing private 
sector involvement and responsibility over time, and 
the establishment of clear performance targets.

On the whole, the results have been very posi-
tive. For example, from 2000 to 2009, the number 
of hours of water supply in Yerevan increased from 
4–6 hours a day to 18–19, and electricity consump-
tion was reduced by more than half.

 holder  policy  dialogues  coined  Strategic 
Financial Planning by the Organisation for 
Economic Co-operation and Development 
(OECD) must be carried out in the context 
of broader sector and urban planning that 
addresses the role and responsibility of public 
agencies, policy priorities, and related regula-
tory and legislative issues in order to ensure 
that the result is a package of measures, which 
can be realistically financed (OECD 2009 and 
2011). Efforts to improve the effectiveness of 
service delivery and lowering of capital costs 
are needed in most cities. These efforts may be 
supported by a range of planning tools includ-
ing strategic financial planning, legislative and 
regulatory reform, benchmarking, and perfor-
mance tools and by combining both funding 
and service provision from the public and pri-
vate sector (World Bank 2012b).

In most countries, particularly, but not 
solely, in Africa, there is a dearth of infor-
mation to guide policy makers and planners. 
Often  there  is  asymmetry  of  information 
across national and local level actors involved 
in policy and planning. For example, in the 
water sector, information about basic issues 
(such as the water supply and sanitation cover-
age and the source, quality, and timely avail-
ability of water consumed by households) is 
limited at the local level and precious little 
data are available about the economic and 

institutional implications of planning deci-
sions. Sharing information across all levels of 
government, as well as between sector agencies 
at one level of government, is indispensable for 
sound planning. OECD (2012) calls this the 
information gap. In addition, particularly for 
water, the geographical mismatch between 
hydrologic and administrative boundaries is a 
major obstacle to successful planning. OECD 
(2012) calls this the administrative gap. Met-
ropolitan areas, with their overlapping juris-
diction and political fragmentation, can lead 
to incoherent and, at worst, mutually exclusive 
water management planning and practice. 
Similarly, the city’s dependence on the catch-
ment and competition for water may threaten 
city-level planning. For example, the water 
supply of Adelaide, Australia, depends cru-
cially on water uses for irrigation and other 
purposes higher in the Murray-Darling catch-
ment. Singapore’s much touted “four taps” 
water management strategy aims to reduce the 
reliance on supply from Malaysia, as heavy 
reliance on one upstream source is perceived 
to entail risks (World Bank 2012b). 

Establishing subsidies
Public policy can set service prices below 
cost-recovery levels to meet social and envi-
ronmental obligations. When prices are set to

cover all the costs of an infrastructure proj-
ect, including the cost of capital, systems will 
likely be built out to serve all customers who 
are ready to pay the service cost. But policy 
makers may also want access to infrastruc-
ture to be extended to other customers—
both for equity and for environmental sus-
tainability. Price discrimination and subsidies 
can boost coverage and access.

Social equity
The poor often pay higher prices per unit 
of, for example, water or energy, than do 
wealthier  people.  Water  vendors  in  poor 
urban areas may charge several times the unit 
cost of modern water service (Klein 2012). 
Price discrimination is a way to restore equity 
by charging rich people more and poor peo-
ple less.

One  method  of  price  discrimination  is 
to offer the poor a specially tailored price-
quality mix. For example, poor people who 
can afford to buy water at times—but not 
regularly—can do so by the bucket. Or the 
poor can be served by simpler pipelines. In 
other ways, too, the poor can be offered flex-
ible service that is better than what they had 
before, yet not exactly what the rich receive. 
(Water that is not fully treated can still serve 
many common uses, such as flushing toilets. 
Poor people can make their water potable by 
boiling it.) Finally, the poor can be given more 
flexible payment terms—for example, through 
the use of electronic cards. In pursuing these 
possibilities, it can help to let unconventional 
providers—from for-profit vendors to commu-
nity-based organizations—enter the market 
(Baker 2009). While these are clearly not the 
only solutions for improving access to water, 
they provide various second-best options to 
provide services of varying quality. 

Governments can also provide subsidies 
for equity. However, one must recognize that 
many subsidies do not increase access to ser-
vices. For example, subsidizing an existing 
utility may help the better-off people who are 
already connected—and no one else (Estache 
and de Rus 2000; Komives et al. 2005).

Accordingly, city leaders should focus dis-
cussions of subsidies on policies to expand 

access. They should target subsidies to poor 
people—whether  by  conducting  means-
testing (as in Chile’s water subsidy system), 
by targeting areas where the poor tend to 
live, or by offering lifeline rates (for reduced 
service  at  a  reduced  price).  Lifeline  rates 
raise an objection, though: they can benefit 
people at any income level. Such objections 
are a reminder that subsidies require careful 
design. Basing them on quantity or consump-
tion does not necessarily promote equity. A 
study of 26 quantity-based subsidy cases in 
Africa, Asia, and Latin America suggested 
that 24 were regressive, and that where cov-
erage is not universal, connection subsidies 
may be better at reaching the poor (Komives 
et al. 2005).

Environmental sustainability
Public transport can mitigate urban conges-
tion: a bus carrying 40 or 50 people takes up 
no more road space than two or three private 
cars. And public transport pollutes less, gen-
erating fewer greenhouse emissions. Yet in 
many countries, public transport is unafford-
able for the poor.

For  example,  households  in  Kampala, 
Uganda, pay $13 a month on fares, about 8 
percent of their budget (World Bank 2011e). 
Although that is consistent with global esti-
mates of what people pay for transport, it 
is unaffordable for the poor. To use public 
transport, the poorest 20 percent of house-
holds would need to spend 41 percent of their 
income on fares. Similar patterns appear in 
other cities worldwide.

The predictable result is that, in many 
developing countries, urban public trans-
port ridership is low. In cities where trans-
port fares do not cover the full cost of ser-
vice provision, transport subsidies can boost 
ridership.  But  such  subsidies,  to  succeed, 
require strong contractual agreements and 
regulation.

The problem is that even after fares are 
decoupled from full operating costs, trans-
port providers still need assurance that their 
costs will be met by revenues. Cities such as 
Bogotá, Curitiba (Brazil), London, and Seoul 
have  solved  the  problem  with  gross  cost

contracts, which assure operators that their 
revenues will be based on performance—not 
on fare box collections (or not directly so). 
To cover costs fully, public agencies then seek 
other sources of revenue.

Transport systems around the world vary 
widely in the share of operating costs that 
they recover through fares. In a sample of 15 
public transit systems, only 2 fully covered 
their costs through fares. In Paris, 51 per-
cent of costs were recovered through fares; 
in New York, 36 percent (figure 1.6). While 
public transport systems appear to be subsi-
dized, what matters for mobility is the rela-
tive price of public and private transport. It 
turns out private transport in many cities 
worldwide are subsidized—as their full costs 
are not recognized because road use and 
parking are not charged efficiently. In Delhi, 
for example, the relative prices of driving to 
public transit range between 1.91 and 4.13; 
in Tokyo, a city with low metro fares and 
high gasoline prices, the relative prices range 
between 5.19 and 7.20; in New York, the 

cost of mass transit is high, but the cost of 
parking is high, as well, so that the relative 
price of driving relative to using public tran-
sit is as high as Tokyo at 6.75 (World Bank 
2011d).

Financing subsidies
Across sectors, subsidies can be funded by 
various taxes. Or they can be funded through 
cross-subsidies. In Paris, where fares cover 
less than 40 percent of public transit operat-
ing costs, the main additional revenue source 
for transport operations is an employment 
tax levied on employers as a share of their 
wage bill (see figure 1.6). The tax is justified 
on the grounds that public transport invest-
ments increase the employers’ access to labor 
markets.

For services other than transport, cross-
subsidies could require richer urban consum-
ers to pay prices in excess of cost—allow-
ing providers to charge poorer customers 
less, perhaps in rural areas or in peripheral 
neighborhoods. (Spotlight B discusses this

approach.) But the viability of such cross-sub-
sidies varies inversely with the scope for com-
petition in the infrastructure sector. Where 
head-to-head competition exists, high prices 
in urban areas could attract new entrants to 
undercut an incumbent who depends on the 
urban market to cover rural costs through 
cross-subsidies. In such cases, a better solu-
tion is a general tax scheme on all providers. 
Several telecommunications regimes impose 
this type of general levy, which is used to 
fund universal access.

Price  discrimination  and  subsidies  can 
expand access to infrastructure services for 
equity and for environmental sustainability. 
Still, city leaders should look first at market 
structures  that  give  providers  the  needed 
incentives and flexibility to cover costs while 
serving as many people as possible.

3.  Head-to-head	competition refers to the case 
where firms compete in	the	market. In this 
kind of competition, firms must offer a price 
lower than that of their competitors (for a cer-
tain quality) in order to increase their profits. 
This keeps a check on prices. In cases where 
head-to-head competition is not possible due to 
the existence of monopolistic characteristics, a 
competitive market can be mimicked through 
the use of auctions. This is called competition	
for	the	market. 

4.  Networks are said to have “natural monopoly” 
characteristics. Marginal costs tend to fall for 
additional  connections,  making  profitable 
entry into segments of the network infeasible 
as long as the network monopoly is free to 
charge any prices it likes. 

5.  In situations with network externalities, pri-
vate underinvestment may justify government 
intervention to provide infrastructure services 
(see chapter 2).

6.  For state-owned firms, governments may use 
performance contracts (such as the contract-
plans traditionally found in France).

7.  This doctrine is a fundamental principle in 
utility regulation, stating that capital assets 

must be physically used and useful to ratepay-
ers before they can be asked to pay the costs 
associated with them (Newbery 2001).

8.  Other schemes can help build credibility. The 
German electricity company, RWE, initially 
escaped nationalization by splitting its prof-
its  50–50  with  the  government.  Similarly, 
resource rents are sometimes shared in min-
ing  contracts  (an  example  is  resource  rent 
taxation).

9.  Some call this “regulation by contract” (for 
example, Gómez-Ibáñez 2003). Not funda-
mentally different from other regulatory rules, 
regulation by contract merely happens to rely 
(partly) on enforcement by the courts.

Slums are not inevitable:  
Rules for flexible land use and 
coordinated connections can 
improve living conditions

The United Nations projects that 2 bil-

lion people will live in slums by 2030. 
How to manage slum formation and 
reduce the hazards faced by slum dwellers?1 
Most policy discussions tend to focus on mov-
ing people to safe environments or providing 
better housing elsewhere. Proposed objectives 
include urban upgrades, such as community 
and household infrastructure projects; reset-
tlement to new housing developments; hous-
ing subsidies; and land titling.

But many of these policies do not work. 
The reason is that people do not always will-
ingly trade away a better location for a bet-
ter home with modern utilities. People choose 
neighborhoods for their affordable services 
and amenities—but also for their proximity 
to jobs.

In many developing-country cities, it can 
be difficult to live near one’s job, because 
land markets have failed: formal housing 
supply is low, in part because of restrictive 
regulations. But it may also be difficult and 
costly to commute to work, because trans-
port infrastructure fails to connect urban 
neighborhoods. Commuting by public transit 
in many African cities would cost more than 
half a poor household’s income. In Harare, 
Zimbabwe,  the  poor  spend  more  than  a 

fourth of their disposable income on trans-
port (Hook 2005).

Do many people live in slums by choice, 
simply because the tradeoffs from commut-
ing would be too great? This seems at least 
possible. What is certain is that many slum 
dwellers are people for whom even the cheap-
est public transit would be too expensive. 
And it is an illustrative fact that in Mumbai 
more than three in five commuters walk to 
their jobs.

To  foster  better  living  conditions,  city 
leaders  can  coordinate  land  market  rules 
with  urban  infrastructure  development. 
Hanoi has been able to grow without the 
formation of large slums because the govern-
ment set prudent rules for land markets and 
infrastructure. It allowed the densification of 
former village areas. It pushed for modern-
izing road networks just outside the city, yet 
it mostly avoided demolishing older houses. 
These roads have opened new land for for-
mal developers while improving connections 
between existing village areas and the city. 
The village areas were allowed to grow and 
were integrated into the urban economy. 

City  leaders  in  Bogotá  similarly  suc-
ceeded by coordinating land use with infra-
structure  development.  The  Programa  de

Mejoramiento Integral de Barrios (PMIB) 
aimed  at  improving  mobility  and  living 
conditions in 26 of the poorest city areas, 
called Unidades de Planificacion Zonal. The 
Unidades comprised 107 neighborhoods of 
informal origin, with 1,440 informal settle-
ments, 300,000 plots not formally titled, and 
about half million structurally substandard 
dwellings. The PMIB legalized homes and 
neighborhoods; it expanded infrastructure 
with roads, rainwater traps, and sanitary 
and aqueduct trunk networks; and it added 
urban facilities (stairs, parks, community 
rooms). Living conditions improved for about 
650,000 people. 

Other cities, such as Bangkok and Jakarta, 
still do not consistently coordinate land use 
with infrastructure. Their undeveloped main 
roads and transit systems are extremely con-
gested, even though the cities are far less 
dense than, say, Hanoi. Their housing sup-
ply has overtaken their transport infrastruc-
ture—making housing fairly cheap, but sur-
rounding it with gridlock. In Jakarta, the loss 
in productivity is severe.

In cities such as Delhi and Mumbai, hous-
ing supply has been restricted by rules prevent-
ing the development of land. The outcomes 
have been very expensive housing, low hous-
ing consumption—and often poor mobility, 
because of infrastructure’s failure to adapt.

In still other countries where the rules for 
land and infrastructure were not set pru-
dently, households ended up disconnected 
from jobs. The government of South Africa 
tried to manage costs for subsidized hous-
ing by choosing isolated sites, with lower 
land values, for about two million newly 
built homes. But there was no plan to con-
nect these subsidized homes to the job mar-
ket. Many workers now commute in collec-
tive taxis, which are slow and expensive. The 
roads are not good enough to handle traffic 

efficiently, and multiple transfers are needed 
to reach dispersed jobs (Bertaud 2009). Buses 
carry other workers on commutes that last 
nearly as long as the work day itself.

Two main lessons emerge from these cit-

ies’ experiences:

•	 Efforts	 to	 alleviate	 slum	 growth	 and	
unsafe conditions with improved housing 
should not have the unintended effect of 
reducing workers’ access to labor markets.
•	 Setting	rules	for	land	and	infrastructure	
coordination can connect generations of 
workers to jobs—and earn city leaders the 
right to say that their policies have trans-
formed urban living conditions.

Note
1.  Slum dwellers, though not all living in hazard 
prone areas, are more likely than others to do 
so. Studies show that the share of the world’s 
urban population subject to natural hazards 
will more than double by 2050. Today, 370 
million  people  live  in  cities  in  earthquake 
prone areas, 310 million in cities with high 
probability of tropical cyclones. By 2050, these 
numbers are also likely to more than double 
(Lall and Deichmann 2009).

The value of market rules for basic 
services: For expanded coverage 
and increased efficiency, it’s not 
all about the money

When policy makers consider how to 

expand infrastructure and improve 
the provision of basic services, they 
have a choice. Rather than give first priority 
to financing, as is often done, they can look at 
the structure of markets for basic services—
and determine what rules will work best.

In particular, policy makers may consider 
rules for competitive pricing and cost recov-
ery. Indeed, in many cases the expectation of 
cost recovery through fees will determine the 
availability of financing.

Consider Colombia. In 1964, only half the 
residents of Bogotá and other large cities had 
access to water, electricity, and sanitation. 
In smaller cities, coverage was even lower. 
Today, there is nearly universal access in cit-
ies of all sizes—a convergence that took more 
than 40 years (figure SB.1).

How did Colombia expand service cover-
age? A big part of the answer is that policy 
reforms allowed fees to nearly cover costs. For 
example, average residential water fees more 
than doubled over 1990–2001 (World Bank 
2004). With almost 90 percent of households 
having a metered connection, household con-
sumption was nearly halved. And that, in 
turn, reduced the need to develop major new 
infrastructure.

Even with fee increases, water remains 
fairly affordable in Colombia. The fee struc-
ture allows the government to cross- subsidize: 
richer households and industrial users pay for 
the poorest consumers. As a result, the aver-
age poor household spends less than 5 per-
cent of its income on utility services.

In the electricity sector, Colombia’s gov-
ernment changed the rules to increase effi-
ciency—loosening  restrictions  on  market 
entry and unbundling electricity provision 
into four categories (generation, transmis-
sion, distribution, and commercialization) 
(Larsen, Pham, and Rama 2004). The policy 
change succeeded, transforming the electric-
ity market in Colombia and greatly increas-
ing its output. Indeed, the country became 
a net exporter of electricity, exporting 1.76 
terawatt hours to Ecuador in 2005.

Vietnam also increased electricity cover-
age—rapidly (figure SB.2). In the early 1990s, 
electricity reached only a small minority of 
Vietnamese (about 14 percent). Today, it is 
available to almost everyone (97 percent). 
Coverage  is  almost  universally  equitable: 
there is little disparity between rural and 
urban areas, and regional gaps are minor.

 What policies led to Vietnam’s steep rise 
in coverage? In 1995, the government created

a public enterprise, EVN, to manage the elec-
tricity system. Prices were kept well below 
cost, and service expansion was funded by 
fiscal transfers along with other EVN rev-
enues.  But  EVN  also  remained  viable  by 
diversifying into other profitable businesses, 
including telecommunications.

Vietnam’s approach has brought benefits 
to many—but those benefits have come with 
costs. First, the service is spotty and ineffi-
cient, with frequent outages (World Bank 
2007). Second, low revenues from electric-
ity provision led EVN to focus on its more 
profitable ancillary businesses, rather than 

on further electricity improvements. Instead 
of focusing exclusively on universal access, 
Vietnam’s policy makers could have tried to 
ensure higher quality. It might have been bet-
ter for all to provide businesses with reliable 
power than everyone with unreliable service. 
And Vietnam cannot easily sustain its fiscal 
support for EVN. The strain on the budget 
gives the government a stake in seeking alter-
natives, such as privately financed electricity 
generation—but  those  alternatives  would 
require cost recovery through higher fees.

Vietnam’s present government is trying to 
increase electricity fees and attract private 
financers and generators. It is also consider-
ing whether to open the electricity market to 
competition among generators. Signs indicate 
that the market can indeed support higher 
fees (World Bank 2007).

In contrast to Colombia and Vietnam, 
Uganda still has large gaps in access to basic 
services throughout the country. In 2008, 
Uganda’s rate of access to improved water 
sources was 22 percent in urban areas and 
5 percent in rural areas (Mugisha and Bor-
isova 2010)—far below the overall average 
for developing countries (84 percent) and for 
the Sub-Saharan region (58 percent) (UNDP 
2008).

Ugandan  policy  makers  have  started 
thinking about the rules that need to be in

place  to  expand  access  to  basic  services. 
A water reform of 1998 focused on creat-
ing the right incentives for more efficient 
service provision: attributing responsibil-
ity to local service managers and increas-
ing  their  accountability.  Since  2000,  the 
national government has been working with 
the Ugandan National Water and Sewerage 
Corporation  (NWSC)—the  autonomous 
public provider of water and sanitation to 
the country’s large towns—to enforce per-
formance contracts. Renewed every three 
years, the contracts include specific indica-
tors that NWSC must meet at the end of the 
period (Banerjee and Morella 2011). How-
ever, Uganda’s reform has not yet attempted 
to promote cost recovery through user fees. 
The NWSC charges a uniform fee across 
all towns and customer categories served. 
In 2010, of 23 areas served, only 6 covered 
production costs.

Policy makers hoping to improve basic 
services have usually focused on financing. 
Sometimes they have even expressed objec-
tives as investment targets (such as spending 
7 percent of GDP on infrastructure). But the 
examples of Colombia, Vietnam, and Uganda 
show the value of rules—three in particular:

•	 Establish	 clear	 and	 consistent	 rules	 for	
service provision to increase effectiveness, 
efficiency, and equity.

•	 Ensure	 sustainability	 through	 full	 cost	

recovery from tariffs and/or transfers.

•	 Where	required,	subsidize	access.

Connecting cities 

A city’s	 connections—external	 and	 in-

ternal, physical and economic—bear 
heavily on its future. Where cities and 
city  neighborhoods  are  disconnected,  labor 
and product markets are not integrated. The 
results  are  forgone  productivity  and  higher 
product  prices,  costs  felt  by  producers  and 
consumers  alike.  And  as  weak  connections 
limit the growth of cities, so feeble cites stunt 
the growth of countries.

The benefits of strong connections are 
well understood.1 Between cities, connec-
tions enable firms to access local, regional, 
and global markets—both for buying inputs 
and selling outputs. They also give consum-
ers options and, in many cases, better prices. 
Within cities, connections enable people to 
access employment; and they enable firms to 
attract workers, access other inputs, and sell 
their products in local markets. Enhanced 
connections	can	expose	cities	to	new	eco-
nomic  opportunities,  allowing  them  to 
flourish. Policy makers who make markets 
and jobs more accessible open the door to 
unforeseen possibilities, facilitating economic 
transformation.

But  city  leaders  who  envision  stronger 
connections for their cities and city neigh-
borhoods face difficult choices. With limited 

resources, they cannot invest in everything. 
It is hard to know which new or improved 
connections will yield the highest returns 
over time. As facts change, cities will need to 
adapt. Setting priorities for investment means 
picking winners and losers in the short run—
but in the long run it can make a vast dif-
ference for entire cities, even countries. Some 
decisions lock cities and countries into pat-
terns that last a century or more; others have 
outcomes that are simply irreversible.

How can policy makers know which con-
nective investments are needed and will yield 
the highest returns? What related consid-
erations should they keep in mind? To help 
their cities grow and adapt by identifying the 
most effective additions and improvements 
to connective networks, city leaders can take 
the following three steps:

•	 Value	 the	 city’s	 external	 and	 internal	

connections.

•	 Coordinate	among	transport	options	and	
with land use, by deciding how to smartly 
use competition among providers and by 
balancing cost recovery with targeted sub-
sidies where needed.

•	 Leverage	investments	that	will	yield	the	

highest returns—for one city or for all.

Value the city’s external and 
internal connections
City	leaders	can	value	a	city’s	external	and	
internal  connections  by  comparison  with 
other cities—cities in similar countries, cities 
at similar development stages or urbanization 
levels, cities with similar per capita income, 
or cities with similar geographic constraints. 
Or city leaders can take a more analytical 
approach,	identifying	a	city’s	desired	con-
nections just as they may identify its desired 
level	of	economic	specialization	or	mix	of	
economic activities—through insights from 
economics and related fields. 

Value cities’ external connections
How should connections be valued? Physi-
cal connections comprise the physical quality 
and capacity of infrastructure, including road 
density. Where information on a road net-
work is available, one useful measure is the 
network’s	total	length.	On	average,	network	
length is far lower for developing regions 
than for high-income countries, which con-
tain	about	60	percent	of	the	world’s	paved	
roads. Even with population size taken into 
account, the gap remains large.

Measure distances 
Where information on road networks is not 
available, measuring intercity connections 
becomes	a	complex	task.	One	cannot	sim-
ply take the straight-line distance between 
cities, because this distance fails to account 
for actual travel conditions in developing 
countries. Nor is the distance between two

points along a road network a good enough 
measure, because it ignores bad roads and 
rough terrain. Rather, the only way to mea-
sure connections with reasonable accuracy 
is to include information on the quality of 
each network segment. In Malawi, the main 
road network does not constrain connections 
very much—but feeder roads do, ratcheting 
up	transport	costs.	Malawi’s	primary	roads	
are wide and smooth in comparison with its 
secondary and tertiary roads, which are nar-
rower, slower, and bumpier (table 2.1).

Again, consider two maps of India—both 
designed to reveal nationwide variations in 
market access, but using different measures 
of the distance between locations (map 2.1, 
with darker shades indicating lower access). 
The left panel uses straight-line distance. In 
contrast, the right panel uses economic dis-
tance: a measure designed to account for the 
number of travel lanes, the roughness of the 
road, and the pavement ratio. The straight-
line distance measure produces much higher 
access estimates than does the economic dis-
tance measure (with transport network con-
ditions considered).

Measure transport costs
In addition to measures of distance, trans-
port	costs	can	be	useful	for	measuring	a	city’s	
external	 connections.	 Typically	 including	
direct vehicle operating costs (maintenance, 
tires, fuel, labor, and capital), transport costs 
can also incorporate indirect costs (licens-
ing,  insurance,  road  tolls,  and  roadblock 
payments).

Measurements	of	Brazil’s	annual	growth	
in transport costs for 2009, 2010, and 2011 
show that costs have been rising, in real terms, 
by an average of about 5 percent a year (table 
2.2)	(World	Bank	2011a).	Brazil’s	paved	road	
network, built in the 1950s and 1970s, has 
since deteriorated (World Bank 2006). Many 
federal and state roads stand in urgent need 
of repaving. In 2007, more than 40 percent of 
roads were considered bad (and less than 35 
percent good), a sharp rise from the less than 
30 percent that were considered bad in 2000. 
Large	investments	in	Brazilian	infrastruc-
ture are needed. But what investments, and

where? The highest increases in transport 
costs over the past three years have been 
over short distances (see table 2.2). Further 
decomposing the transport costs by source 
would	help	explain	why	they	are	rising,	and	
why they are rising most on certain road seg-
ments.	In	Vietnam,	such	decomposition	was	
achieved through a trucking industry survey 
developed by the World Bank urbanization 
review	team	(box	2.1).	

Systematically disaggregating transport 
costs can identify bottlenecks—and reveal 

opportunities for infrastructure improvement 
to yield high dividends. When the trucking 
survey was administered in India, it showed 
that transport costs were highest near large 
cities:	a	pattern	similar	to	that	of	Vietnam	
(and also of Brazil). Freight rates for metro-
politan transport in India, defined as trips 
shorter than 100 kilometers, averaged as high 
as Rs 5.2 per ton-kilometer ($0.12)—twice 
the national average of Rs 2.6, and more 
than five times the cost of such trips in the 
United States.

Why	 are	 India’s	 metropolitan	 freight	
transport costs so much higher than its long-
haul costs? One reason is the use of smaller, 
older trucks on metropolitan routes. Another 
is the higher share of empty backhauls (truck-
ers returning without a load) on metropolitan 
routes. Finally, trucks on metropolitan routes 
clock about 25,000 kilometers annually—
just a fourth of what they need to be econom-
ically viable. To improve coordination and 
reduce the cost of metropolitan freight move-
ments, trucking firms could adopt logistics

trucking industry survey

Identifying road connection constraints in Vietnam: The World Bank’s 

To	understand	Vietnam’s	transport	infrastructure	
bottlenecks and reveal the main drivers of its trans-
port costs, the World Bank urbanization review 
team commissioned a route-specific trucking survey 
(map B2.1.1). It comprised structured, face-to-face 
interviews with key managers and owners of truck-
ing companies, as well with individual operators 
who owned or leased their trucks as independent 
businesses. The final sample included 246 respon-
dents  answering  questions  on  852  data  points  
(origin-destination combinations).

The survey suggested that corruption and poor 
road conditions were the main causes of bottlenecks 

in	Vietnamese	truck	transport.	On	average,	truck	
operators rated the severity of corruption at 3.7 out 
of 5 and the severity of poor road conditions at 3.1 
out of 5. 

Trips	in	the	vicinity	of	Hanoi	and	Ho	Chi	Minh	
City	appeared	to	have	higher	transport	costs.	About	
13	percent	of	transport	costs	around	Ho	Chi	Minh	
City,	 and	 6	 percent	 around	 Hanoi,	 consisted	 of	
informal facilitation payments (such as bribes). On 
average, such payments account for about 8 percent 
of all trucking operation costs.

management systems; they could collabo-
rate or consolidate with competitors; or they 
could	form	trucking	associations.	If	India’s	
high  freight  costs  are  not  reined  in,  then 
they—like	Vietnam’s—will	affect	national	
economic development. That is because both 
nations have large concentrations of eco-
nomic activity in metropolitan areas.

Transport  prices  depend  partly  on  the 
quality and capacity of infrastructure. But 
they also reflect the governance and market 
structure of the transport sector, since the 
indivisibility  of  transport  networks  leads  
to natural monopolies (World Bank 2008). 
For	example,	once	a	rail	network	is	built,	
other firms are unlikely to enter the market. 
The	fixed	costs	of	building	a	second	network	
are	too	high—and	the	owner	of	the	existing	
one can bar other providers from it or charge 
them prohibitive fees for its use. The govern-
ment therefore needs to promote competitive 
behavior in transport service provision—
but how? One way is to own the network. 
Another is to regulate prices at competitive 
levels (Klein 2012).2

Value a city’s internal connections
In  planning  to  increase  access,  to  ensure 
affordability, and to keep traffic and pollu-
tion within acceptable limits, policy makers 
need	to	begin	by	assessing	a	city’s	mobility	
constraints. A good first step is to look at 
three measures: transport mode, street den-
sity, and population density.

Measure the use of transport modes
First, what is the modal split of commutes to 
work? In Uganda, data from national surveys 
suggest that 64 percent of urban workers com-
mute on foot—a figure that rises to 70 percent 
in Kampala (figure 2.1). For people who live 
far	from	a	city’s	economic	centers,	few	jobs	
are available within walking distance—so 
the prevalence of foot commuting constrains 
labor	markets.	It	may	also	exacerbate	slums,	
as many people will trade away housing qual-
ity to be near their jobs. And it points to the 
insufficiency of affordable transport options 
(see chapter 1) (Kumar and Barrett 2008).

Measure street density
Second, street density can also help to iden-
tify	constraints	on	mobility	among	a	city’s	
neighborhoods. Map 2.2 shows streets wider 
than 15 meters in the central business dis-
tricts of Bangkok, Hanoi, New York, and 
Seoul.	They	indicate	that	Hanoi’s	street	den-
sity,	though	greater	than	Bangkok’s,	is	less	
than	a	third	of	New	York’s—while	Hanoi	
lacks the transport alternatives of a city such 
as	New	York	or	Seoul	(both	have	extensive	
underground metro systems).

Measure population density
Third, information on street density can be 
combined with population size and density to 
predict the stress that added vehicles would 
create	 for	 road	 networks.	 For	 example,	 if	
car ownership in Hanoi were to rise until it 
equaled the average in Malaysia (250 cars 
per 1,000 inhabitants), the result—assum-
ing	no	expansion	of	road	or	other	transport	
infrastructure—would be total gridlock in 
the central part of Hanoi. To ensure that just 
half	of	Hanoi’s	cars	could	travel	at	30	kilo-
meters per hour after the assumed increase 
in	car	ownership,	Hanoi’s	vehicular	street	
area would need to rise from 9 percent of the 
built up area—the present total—to 19 per-
cent. Note that population densities are much

Measure transport prices and compare 
them with transport costs—and 
consider the benefits of competition
As  discussed  above,  when  constraints  on 
a	 city’s	 external	 connections	 are	 associ-
ated with distance, the constraints can be 
measured using transport costs and physi-
cal measures. But many constraints on con-
nections—internal	and	external	alike—are	
induced by policy. 

To measure constraints induced by pol-
icy, city leaders can look at transport prices. 

Transport prices reflect various factors: trans-
port costs, operator overhead, operator profit, 
regulatory constraints, and market structure. 
The last of these—market structure—is a key 
determinant of prices in the transport indus-
try. As noted above, some transport mar-
kets are natural monopolies. Another cause 
of monopolistic behavior is the emergence 
of transport scale economies, leading to a 
vicious circle between higher costs and lower 
trade and traffic. Areas with high demand 
and large freight volumes will generate com-
petition,  reducing  prices—but  areas  with 
lower demand will attract only a few provid-
ers,	who	are	likely	to	seek	excessive	profits.	

Connecting	sparsely	populated	rural	areas	
can enable people and firms to move to more

productive areas. It can also increase resi-
dents’	access	to	schools,	health	centers,	and	
local markets. However, given that lagging 
places do not have great market potential 
(and the volumes transported are likely to 
be small), it can be hard to attract transport 
operators to these areas—let alone induce 
competition among them. Merely improv-
ing roads or deregulating the market will 
not suffice. In these cases, policy makers can 
encourage intermediate modes of transport. 
Bicycles, hand carts, motorcycles, power til-
lers and trailers, and community participa-
tion—all can increase mobility in rural areas 
(Lall,	Wang,	and	Munthali	2009).

Competition in the market and for the market 
Considerable	benefits	follow	from	inducing	
competition in the transport sector. One is 
greater efficiency. Another is more affordable 
service. In contrast, a monopolistic sector is 
likely to be inefficient and unaffordable—and 
to encourage opportunistic behavior, inviting 
markups and creating incentives for bribes.

Along major transport routes in Africa, 
considerable gaps separate transport prices 
from transport costs (figure 2.2). A recent 
study by the World Bank suggests that the 
causes of these gaps are bribes, regulatory 
rents, and high profits (Teravaninthorn and 
Raballand 2009). Inefficiencies in logistics, 
such as large numbers of empty backhauls, 
could also be driving prices up.

A competitive market brings benefits, not 
only within transport modes (competition in 
the market), but also between them (compe-
tition	for	the	market).	Competition	between	
modes can lower prices, and it can promote 
the most efficient distribution of transport 
services for various product types. Generally, 
most road transport is dominated by short-
haul freight—but as distance increases, rail 
transport becomes more attractive. In India, 
road transport is estimated to be the least 
expensive	option	for	distances	up	to	400	kilo-
meters. Rail prices are lower for distances of 
400–700 kilometers. Beyond 700 kilometers, 
waterways	are	cheapest	(McKinsey	&	Com-
pany 2010). These break points may vary by 
country, as they depend on truck, train, and

vessel size and on the type of product being 
transported. Similarly, topographical endow-
ments and barriers are likely to affect the 
break points. 

High  demand  can  have  two  opposed 
effects  on  transport  prices.  As  discussed 
above, it can attract competition leading to 
lower prices. But it can also lead to conges-
tion, and congestion—beyond what the infra-
structure and its maintenance regimes can 
readily handle—imposes economic costs. In 
Sri	Lanka,	estimates	suggest	that	traffic	vol-
umes and poor road maintenance contribute 
costs equivalent to about 1 percent of GDP 
(World	Bank	2004).	And	in	Colombia,	delays	
in  ports  (especially  the  busiest  ones)  sig-
nificantly increase transport costs: for every 
hour that cargo remains idle, the added cost 
per	ton	is	826	pesos	($0.69)	(Samad,	Lozano-
Gracia, and Panman 2012). A 2007 study 
of	logistics	costs	for	trucking	in	Colombia’s	
port terminals showed that, on average, driv-
ers reported nine hours of lag time between

joining the queue for entry into port facilities 
and departing the facilities with a new freight 
load (Egis Bceom International 2007).

Coordinate among transport 
options and with land use 
to improve a city’s internal 
connections
Once city leaders have identified constraints 
on	 a	 city’s	 internal	 connections,	 they	 can	
determine what is needed for a good trans-
port	system—one	that	connects	the	city’s	
neighborhoods to each other, giving people a 
wider choice of places to live and work.

Connections	among	neighborhoods	are	
a growing problem for cities in developing 
countries. As incomes rise and populations 
explode,	private	motor	vehicles	strain	road	
capacity.	In	1981–2001,	for	example,	while	
the	population	of	India’s	six	largest	metro-
politan cities nearly doubled, the number of 
private motor vehicles increased eightfold. In 
Delhi alone, motor vehicles shot up from 3.9 
million to 5.6 million between 2002–03 and 
2007–08.	Meanwhile	the	city’s	total	road	
length merely crept up, from 30,698 kilome-
ters to 30,985. Because of this disconnection 
between urban growth and urban infrastruc-
ture, trips in large Indian cities are barely 
faster by car or truck than by bicycle.3

Although some urban congestion can be 
efficient, too much is the opposite. It keeps 
people stuck in traffic for long hours, unable 
to reach their jobs—not to mention the health 
problems caused by pollution. A good trans-
port system allows people to reach jobs while 
further linking them to education, health, 
and recreation. Policy makers need ways to 
boost mobility within a city while managing 
congestion and pollution, and they need to 
ensure that transport is available to the poor. 
To connect neighborhoods for all these 
purposes,  city  leaders  can  systematically 
coordinate urban mobility plans with land 
use policies and related infrastructure plans. 
In addition, they can seek ways to reduce 
transport  prices—within  cities  as  well  as 
between them—by inducing competition in 

transport markets. Finally, they can consider 
how to balance the aim of covering transport 
costs through prices against other social and 
ecological objectives.

Establish a basis for increased mobility 
within cities
As city leaders seek to improve connections 
among  neighborhoods,  they  must  care-
fully steer away from options that lock the 
city into undesirable forms. The best way to 
avoid such wrong turns is to begin by inte-
grating land use policies with plans for urban 
mobility.

Integrate land use planning and mobility 
planning
Plans to connect neighborhoods are insepa-
rable from plans for urban land use—espe-
cially density plans. For any of these policies 
to benefit the city as intended, they must be 
integrated throughout the planning process. 
However, urban transport is often an “insti-
tutional  orphan,”  with  its  responsibility 
often	fragmented	across	agencies.	Land	use	
planning is a core function of development 
authorities, with transport planning often 
limited to developing the road network. Such 
fragmentation of responsibilities results in 
inefficiencies. In Bangalore, India, a new air-
port, several miles outside the city, was close 
to being commissioned when city authorities 
realized that the road connecting the city to 
the airport was inadequate.

Land	 use	 planning	 is	 integral	 to	 trans-
port planning, because land use will largely 
determine transport demand. Different cities 
need	different	modal	mixes,	different	neigh-
borhoods different modes. Mass transport 
generally suits compact areas, private vehicles 
more	sprawling	ones.	Mixed-use	plans	can	
reduce the need for long trips by locating 
housing, shops, services, and jobs all within a 
short radius. Studies also suggest that higher 
densities are good for efficiency and for envi-
ronmental sustainability, reducing energy 
consumption and emissions by reducing vehi-
cle miles traveled (Newman and Kenworthy

1998;	Schrank,	Lomax,	and	Eisele	2011).

Transport plans, in turn, shape land use 
by making specific sites more accessible. For 
example,	a	new	road	to	undeveloped	land	
can enable its development. Or a new down-
town metro connection can boost demand 
for redevelopment of the urban core.

Look for prudent ways to make transport 
markets competitive
Not all modes and routes will support mul-
tiple  transport  providers.  But  where  they 
will—and where demand is high enough—
policies and regulations should foster com-
petition	and	avert	monopolies.	Competitive	
pricing can also be encouraged by promoting 
multiple modes of transport.

Although  competition  across  modes 
may be desirable, free entry to some indi-
vidual modes may not be. In bus transport, 
for	example,	competition	that	is	excessively	
fierce—or not structured carefully by plan-
ners—can	put	passengers’	lives	at	risk	(see	
the discussion of Bogotá in chapter 1). 

Balance the aim of covering transport 
costs through market pricing with the 
complementary objectives of efficiency, equity, 
and environmental sustainability
Cost	recovery	through	prices	need	not	always	
mean  that  transport  users  pay  the  whole 
cost of transport. Urban transport subsidies 
are sometimes desirable, not only for equity 
and the environment (reducing emissions and 
so forth), but also for efficiency (Gwilliam 
1987).	For	example,	subsidies	that	target	
lower-income groups to make urban tran-
sit more affordable can boost ridership and 
reduce congestion.

Many cities in the developing world lack 
affordable transport for their poorest resi-
dents.	 An	 extreme	 example	 is	 Mumbai,	
ranked	 as	 the	 6th	 most	 expensive	 among	
27	 cities	 worldwide	 (Carruthers,	 Dick,	
and Saurkar 2005). According to a study 
published  in  2007,  for  riders  in  the  low-
est income category in Mumbai, transport 
expenditure	represented	at	least	16	percent	

of income—even with subsidies covering as 
much	as	30	percent	of	transport	costs	(Crop-
per and Bhattacharya 2007).

Targeted subsidies have not always been 
successful. But some targeted subsidies reach 
the right groups and increase their access 
to	 jobs.	 For	 example,	 South	 Africa	 uses	
highly  subsidized  weekly  coupons—each 
for 10 journeys between black townships 
and industrial development areas—to con-
nect low-income groups to jobs. And Brazil 
requires formal sector employers to provide 
transit tickets to their employees through a 
system called vale transporte (transportation 
voucher,	VT);	the	firms	then	deduct	the	VT	
expenditures	from	taxable	income.	The	VT	
system—albeit affecting only the formal sec-
tor—effectively spreads the cost of transport 
subsidies between employers and the govern-
ment (Gwilliam 2011).

Increase the supply of transport 
while managing demand and harmful 
externalities
Once the basis for a better transport system 
is in place, an urban mobility plan can be 
made that: 

•	 Increases	 transport	 supply	 (capacity)	
through new investments and ensures ade-
quate maintenance.

•	 Improves	existing	transport	systems	by	

managing demand.

•	 Controls	congestion	and	limits	pollution	

with fiscal and regulatory instruments.

The ultimate objective is to increase the 
supply of affordable transport options while 
keeping traffic and pollution within accept-
able limits.

City	 leaders	 can	 make	 investments	 in	
added network capacity and multiple trans-
port modes. They can manage the demand 
for  transport  through  regulation,  enact-
ing	policies	that	reduce	pressure	on	existing	
infrastructure. Finally, they can control traf-
fic and limit emissions with fiscal and regula-
tory	instruments	such	as	subsidies	and	taxes.

Increase transport supply through new 
investments, with attention to demand
Because transport infrastructure investments 
are	part	of	a	city’s	mobility	plan,	they	need	
to be integrated with its land use plan (as 
emphasized	above).	The	next	section	of	this	
chapter—on identifying the investments that 
will yield the highest returns—presents a 
detailed discussion of ways to enhance trans-
port supply, between cities as well as within 
them.

What needs underlining here is that devel-
oping cities cannot attain desirable forms 
unless investments in infrastructure are coor-
dinated with land use—and with efforts to 
manage demand.

Improve existing transport systems 
by managing demand
To have strong internal connections, a city 
must have a transport system that is respon-
sive to demand: not just new roads or a new 
metro line, but also regulatory and fiscal 
instruments that will manage the demand for 
both	new	and	existing	infrastructure.	This	
need to manage demand is seldom considered 
by developing cities—they have traditionally 
focused on increasing supply (Gómez-Ibáñez 
2011).4

The management of infrastructure can 
direct  demand  to  transport  modes  with 
unused  capacity—relieving  pressure  on 
modes  that  are  already  congested  to  the 
point of strain. It can restrain the demand 
for travel, or it can incline demand to take a 
certain	form.	For	example,	demand	restraint	
measures can seek to shift commuters from 
private vehicles to mass transport. They can 
motivate people to travel during off-peak 
times. They can seek to reduce trip lengths. 
And in some cases, they can be designed to 
render travel unnecessary. 

In addition to managing demand, regula-
tions can promote competition in the market 
or set prices near competitive levels (chapter 
1). And they can include policies to mitigate 
harmful	externalities,	such	as	congestion	and	
pollution from vehicle emissions.

Congestion	and	pollution	need	to	be	man-
aged with fiscal and regulatory instruments. 

Even with coordination between investments 
to increase supply and policies to manage 
demand,  individual  actions  often  impose 
social  costs.  In  transport,  these  harmful 
externalities	arise	mostly	from	congestion	
and from pollution (including greenhouse gas 
emissions).

In the developing world, rapid increases 
in private motor vehicle use have created 
excessive	congestion.	A	look	at	the	numbers	
for	 Vietnam	 shows	 how	 quickly	 vehicles	
have multiplied in recent years (figure 2.3). 
A recent study estimates the economic costs 
of traffic congestion to be equivalent to 0.7 
percent of GDP in Manila, 0.9 percent in 
Jakarta,	1.8	percent	in	Kuala	Lumpur,	and	
2.1	percent	in	Bangkok	(ESCAP	2007).	

City	leaders	often	consider	building	more	
roads to accommodate rising numbers of pri-
vate	vehicles—yet	road	expansion	in	the	long	
run may only attract more vehicles to the 
road, with no resulting reduction in traffic. 
Even if congestion declines, fuel consumption 
and emissions will not. Moreover, new infra-
structure requires land and rights-of-way 
that can be costly and difficult to assemble 
in cities.

Fiscal  and  regulatory  instruments  are 
another way to manage congestion and limit 
pollution. Used in combination with infra-
structure  investments,  such  instruments 
can guarantee that the benefits of increased 
access	exceed	its	social	costs.	To	determine	
the best instrument in a given case, a cost-
benefit analysis can be conducted, with atten-
tion to impacts on efficiency, equity, and 
affordability.

To bring congestion down to manageable 
levels, policies can discourage the use of per-
sonal motor vehicles, making their use more 
difficult and costly. Measures that have been 
used include restrictions on available parking 
space, parking fees that reflect the full eco-
nomic cost of motorized travel, and a conges-
tion fee for driving in core city areas at peak 
times.

Congestion	 fees	 would	 seem	 to	 be	 the	
most efficient instrument for their purpose, 
as	 they	 attack	 the	 externality	 directly.	 In	
practice, their use is limited—they tend to

be	politically	costly.	Examples	in	the	devel-
oped	world	include	London,	Singapore,	and	
Stockholm.

The	City	of	London	raised	£137	million	in	
2007 from its congestion fees, which by law 
are reinvested into public transport systems in 
the city. Drivers entering, leaving, or driving 
in the congestion zone between 7 a.m. and 
6 p.m. on weekdays must pay a fee of about 
$16 by midnight of the same day. If they do 
not	pay	the	fee	by	the	next	day,	it	increases	to	
$20. If still unpaid, the fee rises to $240 on 
the following day and to $360 after 28 days. 
After that the authorities can tow the car or 
immobilize it with wheel boots, either action 
burdening the car owner with $140–$400 
in added costs. Residents of the congestion 
zone must pay, but at a 90 percent discount. 
Exemptions	are	given	for	disabled	 drivers	
and for bicycles, motorcycles, and electric or 
alternatively fueled cars.5 

London’s	congestion	fee	has	reduced	the	
number of cars on the roads each day, and it 
has raised revenue for the city. It is also asso-
ciated with a 6 percent increase in the number 
of bus passengers during charging hours. The 
policy, however, achieves less than it could in 
two ways. First, drivers have no incentive to 
limit driving once inside the congestion zone. 
Second, there is no additional incentive to 
reduce driving during peak hours, since the 
fee	is	constant	throughout	the	day	(Litman	
2006).

Other cities have tried to discourage the 
use	of	cars	by	making	cars	expensive	to	own.	
They	may	charge	high	vehicle	taxes	or	regis-
tration fees—or they may hold auctions for 
the	legal	right	to	buy	a	car.	Vehicle	taxes	have	
been imposed in Denmark, France, Germany, 
Malaysia, the Netherlands, Philippines, Swe-
den,  Thailand,  and  the  United  Kingdom. 
Such	taxes	can	be	based	on	engine	model	and	
capacity, fuel economy, emissions, weight, or 
fuel type (Timilsina and Dulal 2010). Auc-
tions are used in Singapore, which since 1990 
has limited the annual rise in the vehicle pop-
ulation to 3 percent (a figure reached through 
long-term projections of land use and trans-
port facility development). The government 
releases  monthly  quotas  to  allocate  new

vehicles, and it issues certificates of entitle-
ment—the right to buy cars—to the highest 
bidders. Good for 10 years, the certificates 
can then be renewed at the prevailing permit 
price (Menon 2002).

Fuel	taxes	can	reduce	both	congestion	and	
pollution—but they can cause unintended 
harm	if	not	properly	defined.	For	example,	
increased transport costs can make products 
less competitive. One solution to this prob-
lem	is	a	discriminatory	tax,	imposed	only	on	
fuels used for private transport (Timilsina 
and Dulal 2010).

Parking fees can help to manage conges-
tion by shifting travelers from private cars to 
mass transit. In Ottawa, the reduction of a 
parking subsidy for government employees 
from 100 percent of the cost to 30 percent 
led—one year later—to a 20 percent reduc-
tion	in	employees’	trips	by	private	car	and	a	
17 percent increase in their use of public tran-
sit (Timilsina and Dulal 2010).

Such fiscal or regulatory instruments are 
more likely to succeed in combination than 
alone. When they are designed to shift travel-
ers from one transport mode to another, the 
other modes must be ready for use, or the 
instruments will not work as desired.

Besides  congestion,  another  harmful 
externality	associated	with	urban	transport	
is unsafe road conditions. Road accidents are 
one of the largest causes of death worldwide, 
resulting  in  1.2  million  annual  fatalities. 
Each hour, about 40 people younger than 25 
are estimated to die in crashes.

The poor and vulnerable tend to be the 
most affected by road accidents. The number 
of annual road fatalities per 1,000,000 peo-
ple has risen in low-income countries, even 
while declining in high-income countries (fig-
ure 2.4). Although low- and middle-income 
countries	have	only	48	percent	of	the	world’s	
registered motor vehicles, they account for 90 
percent of road fatalities. To realize the bene-
fits of stronger connections within cities, reg-
ulation to control speeds—and guarantee the 
safety of public transport—may be essential.
Taxes,	standards,	and	subsidies	can	also	
be used to manage pollution and to make 
transport more affordable. In many cities, 
the transport sector is the main contribu-
tor to local air pollution and greenhouse gas 
emissions.	In	Brazil’s	largest	cities,	private	
transportation is the main source of vehicle 
emissions, even though it is used by just 30 
percent of commuters (figure 2.5). Across 
all city sizes private transportation gener-
ates more than 40 percent of greenhouse gas 

emissions—and in medium-size cities, those 
of  100,000–250,000  people,  it  generates 
more than 70 percent.

To limit or reduce air pollution and green-
house gas emissions, city leaders may con-
sider emissions standards a useful instrument. 
Other	measures	include	pollution	taxes,	fuel	
economy standards, and fuel quality stan-
dards. Motor vehicle emissions have been reg-
ulated since the 1960s and 1970s in Europe 
and the United States. More recent, new cars 
have been required to meet emissions stan-
dards	 in	 Argentina,	 Brazil,	 Chile,	 China,	
Colombia,	India,	and	Indonesia	(following	
U.S.	and	European	practice).	In	2009,	Cali-
fornia and the European Union set specific 
standards	for	carbon	dioxide	emissions.	But	
fuel economy standards, which also control 
carbon	dioxide,	had	been	established	much	
earlier (in 1975) by the U.S. federal govern-
ment (Gómez-Ibáñez 2011).

Adding	congestion	taxes	or	fuel	taxes	can	
further reduce pollution along with conges-
tion. Again, a combination of instruments 
can be more successful than one—if all are 
planned within a single framework.

Subsidies may be appropriate for transport 
modes that are preferable because they are 
more	ecologically	sustainable.	For	example,	
Mexico	City’s	system	for	bus	rapid	transit	
(BRT)	is	expected	to	reduce	carbon	monox-
ide emissions by 0.28 metric tons and to gen-
erate $3 million each year in health benefits 
from reduced air pollution. And the Trans-
Milenio BRT system in Bogotá, in its first 30 
years of operation, will reduce carbon mon-
oxide	emissions	by	an	estimated	15	percent,	
reduce traffic fatalities by 93 percent across 
the system, reduce local air pollutants by 40 
percent, and improve travel time by 32 per-
cent, compared with the transport system 
that	would	be	available	otherwise	(Lee	2003;	
Gómez-Ibáñez 2011).

Because the costs of air pollution are not 
internalized by private agents, city leaders 
may choose to subsidize cleaner transport—
such as BRT—as a way of internalizing the 
additional benefits from switching to cleaner 
modes.  Where  congestion  costs  at  peak 
hours are high, policy makers may consider

demand-side subsidies to shift demand for 
private cars toward public transit. Subsidiz-
ing cleaner vehicles and cleaner fuels can help 
in reducing pollution and emissions from 
vehicles, though not in reducing congestion.

Leverage investments that will 
yield the highest returns
When deciding where and how to improve 
transport networks, city leaders should iden-
tify the most efficient investments in connec-
tions throughout a country. Where is demand 
highest	for	the	expansion	of	infrastructure	
and transport services? Which corridors are 
identified by spatial tools and simulations as 
most central to the network, in that improv-
ing them will yield the highest returns—both 
locally and nationally, for efficiency and for 
equity?6

Within  urban  areas,  investments  to 
improve connections similarly require inte-
gration with long-term planning—especially 
land use and density plans, as the preceding 
sections have emphasized. Most cities will 
benefit from mass transit and from multiple 

transport modes. The questions that city lead-
ers	must	answer	concern	the	particular	mix	of	
modes, their specific design, and their integra-
tion in the larger urban transport system.

Consider ways to induce healthy 
competition
More	 than	 building	 and	 fixing,	 efforts	 to	
improve intercity connections are also about 
the economics of the transport sector. If the 
market structure for transport service provi-
sion does not promote competitive pricing, 
any cost reductions stemming from network 
investments will be absorbed by monopolis-
tic providers as profit. That is because of the 
sector’s	tendency	toward	natural	monopolies,	
discussed earlier in this chapter.

Investments in infrastructure are more suc-
cessful when bundled with regulatory reforms 
that promote competitive pricing while ensur-
ing compliance with safety standards. The 
government regulates in large part to induce 
healthy competition—limiting monopolis-
tic behavior but also limiting the number or 
behavior of competitors where required.

In Uganda, as in many other African coun-
tries, a large gap between transport costs and 
prices attests to monopolistic behavior (see 
figure 2.2). Along the Kampala–Mombasa 
corridor,	home	to	most	of	Uganda’s	indus-
trial production, transport prices are $2.22 
per kilometer—double the average price in 
the United States—even though transport 
costs per kilometer are about $0.35 per kilo-
meter. According to trucker surveys, 86 per-
cent of the corridor is in good condition. So 
the fact that providers are making more than 
85 percent profit suggests a need for competi-
tion, competition that can be most effectively 
induced through policy measures and regula-
tion (World Bank 2012b).

Use spatial analysis to set priorities for 
intercity connections
Once the basis for competitive pricing is in 
place,  spatial  or  geographic  analysis  can 
reveal the emerging demand for particular 
cities and help city leaders identify the invest-
ments that will most reduce transport costs. 
Some	spatial	tools	examine	the	growth	of	
cities by looking at their demographic and 
economic footprints. Others point to areas 
of	urban	expansion,	those	where	investments	
can	yield	the	highest	returns.	Combining	this	
information with data on households and on 
industry location can suggest where demand 
is	 highest	 for	 expanded	 infrastructure	 or	
related	services	(box	2.2).

Transport	markets	display	network	exter-
nalities,  meaning  that  improvements  to 
one segment can affect the whole network. 
Spatial tools can help identify the network 
improvements that will bring the highest pos-
itive	externalities.	And	that,	in	turn,	can	help	
city leaders identify and understand the com-
plex	tradeoffs	between	efficiency	and	equity	
in decisions about transport infrastructure.

Take	 Sri	 Lanka,	 where	 transport	 costs	
are high by international standards. It costs 
$2.90 per kilometer to move products there, 
more than twice the U.S. cost of $1.25. The 
quality of the road network seems to be a 
main driver of transport costs: more than 
half reportedly is in bad condition (World 
Bank 2010). In deciding which segments to 
improve, policy makers must weigh two con-
flicting objectives:

•	 Efficiency.	Resources can be allocated 
to  investments  that  make  the  most  of 
national income (connecting regions with 
the highest rate of return), or to those that 
would reduce transport costs by the great-
est amount (compared with investments in 
other network segments).

•	 Equity.	 Resources  can  be  distributed 
equally throughout the country, with no 
eye to efficiency.

Recent research used a simulation model 
to  measure  transport  cost  savings  from 
alternative infrastructure investments in Sri 

BOX 2.2  The Republic of Korea’s strategic decisions to expand infrastructure 
networks enabled the development of new towns

City	leaders	in	the	Republic	of	Korea	integrated	their	
transport infrastructure investments to enable the 
spatial evolution of the economy. Figures B2.2.1–
B2.2.3 depict changes in the spatial distribution of 
city sizes, in the share of manufacturing employ-
ment,	and	in	proximity	to	intercity	highways.	As	
the left panel in each figure illustrates, in the 1960s 
the  population  was  concentrated  in  the  cities  of 
Seoul and Busan. The middle panels show how in 
the 1980s, as these cities grew and manufacturing 

was concentrated in and near them, the government 
made efforts to connect them—to each other and 
to domestic and international markets. Finally, the 
right panel in each figure shows how urbanization 
advanced and large urban centers arose outside Seoul 
and Busan. Korean manufacturing now remains 
highly concentrated in and around these two cities—
yet government efforts have ensured that the entire 
national network of cities is well connected.

Lanka	(World	Bank	2010).	The	main	finding:	
connections in poor and remote areas can 
be most enhanced by improving roads and 
transport in areas of intermediate wealth—
not in the poorest and most remote areas 
themselves, where traffic is thin. Improving 
corridors with the highest potential, such as 
that	from	Kandy	to	Colombo,	will	connect	
the most poor people to large markets (map 
2.3). Since these investments will promote 
both efficiency and equity, it makes sense to 
give them priority. 

Similarly, a recent study identified key 
infrastructure investments for Mozambique 
using population distribution data and infor-
mation about the road network (including 
quality characteristics). The study showed 
that investments in the five major interna-
tional transport corridors (in the north of 
the  country),  and  in  the  Maputo–Pemba 
corridor, would greatly reduce travel times 
between major cities—but would scarcely 
improve	most	people’s	access	to	markets.	
Instead, large investments in feeder roads 
were revealed as the best way to improve con-
nections for people in remote northern areas. 
If the corridors were paved and kept in good 
condition while the entire rural road network 

was upgraded to high-quality gravel, 9 of 10 
people would reside within five hours of a 
city with at least 50,000 inhabitants (Dorosh 
and Schmidt 2008).

Increase urban transport capacity— 
but how?
Discussions of urban transport have tradi-
tionally  focused  on  supply.  Enhancement 
was long taken to mean increasing the sys-
tem’s	 carrying	 capacity	 to	 meet	 growing	
demand. Making roads wider, enabling them 
to hold more traffic, was considered the best 
approach. But now that rising incomes are 
making private vehicles more common, add-
ing road space only attracts more cars onto 
the roads. In place of wider roads, affordable 
mass transit—either public or private—has 
come to be seen as a central need for cities.

Why affordable mass transit is essential for 
urban development in many cities
When  urban  transport  is  available  and 
affordable, people are freer to settle in areas 
across the city. When it is not, people are less 
free in their choice of housing, locations, and 
amenities because they are constrained by 

P L A N N I N G ,   C O N N E C T I N G ,   A N D   F I N A N C I N G   C I T I E S — N O W

the need to stay near their jobs. A symptom 
of this constraint is a large informal market 
for land and housing—often located precari-
ously on hilltops, floodplains, and the like. In 
India, data from the 2001 census suggested 
that slum dwellers were more likely than oth-
ers to walk or bicycle to work (figure 2.6). 
Slum dwellers may thus be internalizing the 
transport constraint as a constraint on loca-
tion and housing, trading off decent living 
conditions for the ability to commute and 
participate in labor markets.

Density and mass transit options
Mass transit can take many forms, including 
public buses, rail, and BRT. As this chapter 
has repeatedly indicated, linking transport 
modes to urban density plans is a critical part 
of planning infrastructure investments.

A scatter chart of some 30 cities, plot-
ting each city according to its density and 
its physical concentration around an urban 
center, shows a consistent pattern: dense and 
compact cities form a group that emphasizes 
mass transit, while sparse and sprawling ones

vehicles  (figure  2.7).  Between  these  two 
groups is a third, larger group that benefits 
most  by  combining  the  two—indeed,  by

integrating several transport modes within a 
single framework.

Two pivotal choices for transit 
Should mass transit use rail or buses? How 
should various transport modes be integrated 
within the urban transport system? These 
are two of the main questions that confront 
urban mass transit planners.

First: In weighing rail against buses, policy 
makers should consider that rail transit sys-
tems rarely cover operating costs with fares.7 
By comparison, BRT generally requires a 
lower	capital	investment—it	often	uses	exist-
ing infrastructure, and it runs at ground level 
(box	 2.3).	 And	 BRT	 can	 operate	 without	
subsidies while charging affordable fares, 
imposing less financial stress on cities (Gwil-
liam	2011).	Note,	however,	that	rail	transit’s	

unrecovered financial cost can be matched or 
exceeded	by	its	social	benefits.

Second, and more important: An essential 
part of integrating land use and infrastruc-
ture planning is the integration of various 
transport infrastructures within the larger 
urban mobility plan. Research has suggested 
that two kinds of integration are needed: 
physical integration for transfers between 
modes,  and  fare  integration  for  avoiding 
excessive	price	competition	among	modes	
(NEA  Transport  Research  and  Training 
2003). Further, different modes have also dif-
ferent energy needs, and therefore much can 
be gained from planning a transport system 
that integrates the different infrastructures 
and considers all costs (World Bank 2012a).

placement, policy, and infrastructure.

BOX 2.3  Bus rapid transit: Successful if handled with care

Bus rapid transit (BRT) systems have been praised—
including by the World Bank—for their performance 
capability, their low build cost compared with rail 
and metro systems, and their ability to operate with 
small subsidies or no subsidies. Famous projects in 
Bogotá	and	Brazil’s	Curitiba	are	often	touted	as	BRT	
successes.

Less	 often	 noticed	 have	 been	 the	 pitfalls	 and	
shortcomings of these and other BRT projects. A 
World Bank review reveals key determinants of suc-
cess along with certain challenges:

•	 Bureaucracy	was	circumvented.	In all 11 cities 
studied, planning and implementation teams were 
formed	outside	existing	public	structures	to	avoid	
bureaucratic obstructions.

•	 Political	leadership	was	on	board. Projects went 
forward rapidly in cities where the mayor or other 
political leaders had a clear vision for BRT, such as 
in	Bogotá,	Curitiba,	Jakarta,	and	Ecuador’s	Guay-
aquil. Projects were stalled, sometimes for years, 
in cities where no such political commitment was 
present.

•	 Lead	times	were	reduced	to	match	political	time-
tables—but	this	produced	gaps	in	planning.	Steps 

toward project completion were hastened so that 
elected officials could claim credit before the end 
of their terms in office. As a result, crucial insti-
tutional, legal, and financial issues were some-
times neglected—though BRT planners gave long 
thought to busway designs (median or curbside), 
platform types (high or low), fuel technologies 
(diesel or compressed natural gas), and fare collec-
tion mechanisms (on board or prepaid).

•	 Fares	were	defined	by	political	authorities—some-
times without a complete calculation of costs and 
revenues.

•	 The	public	was	not	adequately	educated	about	
route	changes.	Communication	failures	occurred	
in	Bogotá,	Santiago,	Mexico	City,	and	Mexico’s	
León	during	the	expansion	of	its	system—leading	
to chaotic conditions and, in some cases, dramatic 
public protests. 

•	 Existing	transport	operators	protested	when	their	
interests	were	sidelined.	For	example,	they	were	
not involved in the BRT process through direct 
negotiations—or the bidding process failed to sat-
isfy them.

•	 Fare	 collection	 systems	 were	 not	 integrated	
everywhere	 with	 public	 transit	 systems.  Such

disconnections occurred in Beijing, Bogotá, and 
Mexico	City.	Even	BRT	corridors	were	not	always	
integrated	 with	 each	 other:	 examples	 include	
Jakarta and Quito.

•	 Bus	scheduling	has	sometimes	led	to	overuse	at	
peak	hours	and	underuse	at	off-peak	hours. Peak 
hour crowding and off-peak inactivity are perhaps 
the most visible weakness in BRT operation. One 
or	both	can	be	seen	in	Beijing,	Bogotá,	Curitiba,	

Guayaquil,	 Jakarta,	 León,	 Mexico	 City,	 and	
Quito.

In short, BRT projects indeed have great poten-
tial—but they must be carefully planned and carried 
out.

Notes
1.  A vast literature shows positive links between 
market access and the growth of cities (see, 
among others, Beeson, DeJong, and Troesken 
2001; Henderson and Thisse 2004; and Tao, 
Hewings,	 and	 Donaghy	 2010).	 For	 exam-
ple, research on Brazil shows that a 1 per-
cent increase in market potential leads to an 
increase in city size of 2.7 percent, while a 
reduction in transport costs of 10 percent leads 
to a 1 percent increase in city growth over a 
decade (Da Mata and others 2007).

2.  Research on the effects of transport deregula-
tion is a major area in recent transport eco-
nomics. Much of the impetus for this devel-
opment  has  come  from  outside  traditional 
transport economics, being intellectually stim-
ulated by work in such areas as regulatory cap-
ture (Stigler 1971), market structures (Baumol, 
Panzar, and Willig 1982), and new regulatory 
instruments	(Laffont	1994).

3.  Bicycles are typically ridden at around 15 kilo-

meters per hour.

4.	 For	 example,	 the	 Ho	 Chi	 Minh	 City	 plan	
for 2025 contains a proposal to build a 161-  
kilometer rail system and highway investments 
of more than $9.8 billion.

6.  In the transport sector, network economies—
where the benefits from connecting two points 
extend	to	all	related	connections	in	the	net-
work—can often benefit from policy measures 

(Economides 1996). That is because a private 
agent whose interests span only two points in 
the network might not realize the wider ben-
efits of connecting them. Say that a new road 
connects Hanoi and Guangzhou. With this 
link,	a	firm	in	Hanoi	has	expanded	its	output	
market by the total number of additional cit-
ies that can be reached through Guangzhou. 
Furthermore,	because	Ho	Chi	Minh	City	is	
already connected to Hanoi and Guangzhou 
to	Beijing,	the	new	road	lets	firms	in	Ho	Chi	
Minh	City	sell	in	Beijing.	Ignoring	such	net-
work effects can lead to underinvestment in 
infrastructure connections.

7.  Few cities can bring the cost of rail transit close 
to the revenues from rail transit. Those few cit-
ies share three important characteristics: they 
are large in absolute terms, they have highly 
concentrated corridor flows, and they have 
medium to high incomes that warrant fairly 
high revenues per passenger (Gwilliam 2011).

New cities should be well located, flexibly 
regulated, and efficiently connected: Lessons 
from China, the Arab Republic of Egypt, and 
the Republic of Korea on placement, policy, 
and provision of infrastructure

C ities in the developing world increas-

ingly  must  accommodate  urban 
	ex-pansion.	During	rapid	urbaniza-
tion,	 existing	 cities	 struggle	 to	 cope	 with	
infrastructure backlogs and increased densi-
ties. Policy makers have two main options: 
they	 can	 expand	 existing	 cities—increas-
ing urban areas and densities—or they can 
 create new ones.

New	cities	have	been	planned,	with	mixed	
success,	in	countries	including	China,	the	
Arab Republic of Egypt, and the Republic of 
Korea. A look at their history suggests two 
main lessons:

•	 New	cities	are	more	economically	viable	if	
they	are	located	near	existing	metropoli-
tan areas.

•	 Given	a	good	location,	a	new	city	can	yield	
higher returns if it benefits from coordi-
nated policies for land use and for infra-
structure—with fluid land markets and 
strong	connections	to	existing	cities.	

These two principles—a good location, 
institutionally supported land use transfor-
mation coordinated with connective infra-
structure—do	 much	 to	 explain	 the	 early	
success	of	China’s	Jing	Ji	Te	Qu or special 

economic	zones	(SEZs).1	The	Shenzhen	SEZ	
was deliberately located just north of Hong 
Kong	 SAR,	 China,	 on	 a	 greenfield	 site	 in	
southern	China.	Although	basically	rural,	
the area had two urban settlements. One was 
Luohu,	the	main	customs	checkpoint	with	
Hong	Kong	SAR,	China	and	a	major	point	of	
cross-border	traffic	on	the	Kowloon-Canton	
Railway. The other was Shenzhen Old Town, 
a stopover for cross-border travelers (Wong 
and Yeh 1985).

China’s	 government	 enabled	 land	 use	
transformation	 in	 the	 Shenzhen	 SEZ	 by	
assembling large lots of land and by adjust-
ing  land  prices  to  attract  industry.  The 
introduction of land auctions in 1987 led 
to a boom in property development, while 
giving	the	local	government	more	extrabud-
getary capital to improve basic and connec-
tive infrastructure—ports and roads, water 
and sewerage, electricity and gas, telephone 
communications—and to carry out develop-
ment	plans	(Zeng	2011).	Shenzhen’s	success	
revolves	around	its	spatial	proximity	to	Hong	
Kong	SAR,	China,	but	this	advantage	was	
supported by strong state actions to nurture 
land	and	labor	markets.	China’s	government	
invested in the initial basic and connective 
infrastructure	for	SEZs,	even	as	it	offered

private  investors  the  opportunity  to  col-
laborate in infrastructure development. The 
government also helped entrepreneurs take 
risks	 and	 experiment	 with	 new	 products,	
in	part	through	subsidized	financing	(Zeng	
2011).	And	the	SEZ	was	granted	considerable	
autonomy in deciding how to attract indus-
try, including legislative authority: it could 
develop municipal laws and regulations along 
the basic lines of national laws and regula-
tions	(Zheng	2009).	Finally,	labor	markets	
were created. Shenzhen was the first zone in 
China	to	adopt	wage	reforms,	including	a	
minimum wage and a social insurance pack-
age (Sklair 1991).

What happens to new cities planned with-
out regard for the principles of convenient 
location,	flexible	regulations,	and	efficient	
connections? They fail. Egypt planned and 
developed 20 towns over the past 20 years 
to	reduce	population	growth	in	Cairo	and	
the Nile valley. Meant for 5 million people, 
the new towns have barely drawn 800,000. 
In	the	Greater	Cairo	Area,	eight	new	towns	
were created to deconcentrate the city—but 
by 2006 they still accounted for less than 
14	 percent	 of	 Greater	 Cairo’s	 population	
increase over a decade (World Bank 2008a). 
The	reason	for	these	failures	is	that	Egypt’s	
new towns are hobbled by their distant loca-
tions, overly rigid land use plans, and lack 
of connective infrastructure. Their planning 
norms, considered restrictive by international 
standards, have elevated property prices and 
limited affordable housing. And the need 
for infrastructure to connect the new towns 
with	 existing	 metropolitan	 markets	 has	
been neglected, deterring firms from relocat-
ing.	Finally,	taxes	on	new	trucks	are	high	in	
Egypt, and important roads are of low qual-
ity, so road transport costs are prohibitive 
(Nathan Associates 1999).

In	contrast	to	Egypt’s	failed	towns,	Korea’s	
new cities were a success. Developed mostly 
over a single five-year period in the mid-
1990s, they quickly attracted 2.7 million new 
residents	(Lee	and	Ahn	2005).	During	their	
rise, Seoul was spatially deconcentrated, and 
its population began a gradual decline. How 
did Korea ensure that its new cities would be 

viable? By basing its regional development 
plans on the principles of convenient loca-
tion,	flexible	regulation,	and	efficient	connec-
tion. During the 1980s, as the demand for 
urban land increased, the government assem-
bled	land	in	Seoul’s	periphery	for	five	new	
cities strategically positioned within 20–25 
kilometers	of	the	city’s	central	business	dis-
trict	(Kim	1999;	Korea	Land	Company	n.d.).	
The land, acquired through public purchase, 
was fully paid for at market prices. Densifica-
tion was encouraged by fluid urban develop-
ment guidelines on issues such as floor area 
ratio and land conversion. And the new cities 
were	connected	to	Seoul’s	core	with	metro	
links and with bridges across the Han River 
(World Bank 2008b).

Rigid  policies  on  land  use  and  urban 
expansion,	with	underinvestment	in	urban	
infrastructure, will limit the growth of new 
cities	and	existing	metropolitan	areas	alike.	
New	cities	are	likely	to	do	well	near	exist-
ing metropolitan areas, but underlying land 
market distortions must also be corrected 
and rights-of-way set aside for infrastructure 
in greenfield locations (just as infrastructure 
must be developed in areas already show-
ing economic promise). The suburbs of large 
metropolitan areas are well suited to the cre-
ation of thriving new cities. Developing new 
cities far from large metropolitan areas is 
more risky—so before a government plans 
to develop such locations, it should first care-
fully assess why they have not already taken 
off. Is it because of regulatory constraints, 
high transport costs, or low market accessi-
bility (limiting yields on private investment)? 
If public investments are made to offset some 
of these costs, will they succeed in counter-
ing the tendency of firms to cluster in sectors 
that value agglomeration economies? Finally, 
since agglomeration economics asserts that 
some  metropolitan  concentration  of  eco-
nomic activity is best for productivity, what 
is the tradeoff in industrial location between 
national efficiency and spatial equity? 

Around the world, new cities have been 
seen as solutions to metropolitan problems. 
But city leaders could more prudently address 
the problems by encouraging fluid urban land

and labor markets—regardless of whether 
the solutions include new cities or redevel-
oping old ones. The main question is not 
whether the government should or should 
not initiate the development of new cities. 
It is whether the government has taken the 
needed measures to correct underlying land 
market failures and has created institutions 
to set aside rights-of-way for infrastructure 
expansion.	With	these	policies	in	place,	a	
city can develop organically. In their absence, 
urban development will falter.

Financing cities

Having identified priorities for invest-

ments, city leaders confront the prob-
lem of financing those investments. 
The main difficulty is the need for money up 
front. Large capital outlays are needed to pro-
vide infrastructure and services that are not 
fully in demand now, but will become so as 
urbanization picks up speed (Mohan 2009). 
The large capital investments that are needed 
in the construction phase—whether for trans-
port,  water  provision,  solid  waste  manage-
ment, or sewage removal and treatment—are 
likely to far exceed the budget of any city gov-
ernment (figure 3.1).

How  do  city  leaders  bridge  the  gap 
between  readily  available  resources  and 
investment needs? What sources should they 
tap? To start with, the government can estab-
lish its creditworthiness by first securing 
cash flows from user fees and taxes—and by 
leveraging the value of land in various ways, 
including taxes. Only with future cash flows 
secured can the government begin to borrow 
money and attract private investment.

Whether financing is public or private gen-
erally does not make the difference between 
successful and struggling cities. But there 
are at least two situations in which private 
financing may be the preferred course: when 

the government sees public-private partner-
ships (PPPs) as a way toward greater long-
term  efficiency  in  service  provision,  and 
when the government suffers from severe 
credit constraints that prevent it from obtain-
ing credit for improvements to a publicly run 
system.

Infrastructure service providers, whether 
public or private, will usually benefit from 
clear government policies that ensure cost 
recovery through competitive pricing. The 
value of covering costs through user fees has 
been emphasized throughout this report.1 
If costs can be covered through prices, then 
whether ownership is public or private need 
not make a large difference to city leaders—
or to the urban residents who are best served 
when provision is reliable, affordable, and 
efficient.

Thus, the primary question for city leaders 
is not likely to be the question of ownership. 
(To be sure, policy debates have too often 
focused on this question—and on details of 
financial engineering that similarly do not 
deserve first consideration.) Instead, policy 
makers are wise to think first about how to 
secure cash flows for service provision, how 
to finance improvements by turning a city’s 
existing assets into new ones, and how to

create an inviting economic environment for 
private firms.

To finance investments in infrastructure, 
city leaders have three main tasks (CDIA 
2010;  World  Bank  Institute  and  PPIAF 
2012). They need to:

•	 Value and develop the city’s creditwor-
thiness. Creditworthiness can be demon-
strated by securing cash flows through 
user fees and taxes—and, where neces-
sary, by raising revenue through leveraged 
assets. It is also possible to tap capital 
markets, either by issuing bonds or by bor-
rowing from specialized financial institu-
tions and intermediaries.

•	 Coordinate public and private finance 
using  clear  and  consistent  rules.  With 
enough assurance that commitments are 
firm, PPPs can reduce the fiscal burden of 
infrastructure improvement projects. 

•	 Leverage existing assets to develop new 
ones, linking both to land use planning. 
Leveraging can include land and prop-
erty taxes; land sales and leases; charges 
for impact and for development (devel-
oper extractions); betterment levies (land 

The rest of this chapter presents key con-
siderations for city leaders, as they scrutinize 
these choices and seek the best way to finance 
their cities’ infrastructure needs. Land-based 
financing instruments and PPPs have both 
advantages and disadvantages. Neither can 
turn a project based on bad economics into 
a good project. Nor is either likely to impose 
excessive costs. Any decision by city leaders 
to pursue one financing option rather than 
another should be made for the sake of effi-
ciency, not finance—except perhaps in times 
of fiscal crisis, when severe credit constraints 
may compel government to tap land-based 
instruments and private finance for addi-
tional resources.

Value and develop the city’s 
creditworthiness
City leaders can also consider borrowing to 
finance infrastructure investments—but bor-
rowing might not be easy. Municipal govern-
ments in most developing countries have little 
access to credit markets, partly because there 
are no local government credit markets.

Despite this lack of local credit in devel-
oping  countries,  experience  in  developed 
countries suggests that local credit can work 
for long-term municipal financing—if regu-
lations are in place to guide the issuance of 
debt and manage the risks. Such regulations 
should clearly set forth procedures for sub-
national governments to follow when lending 
money, including the purposes, types, and 
amounts of allowable loans. They also should 
clearly define institutional mechanisms for 
approving loans and monitoring debt (Liu 
2010).

Only a strong regulatory framework can 
enable cities to manage debt and reduce the 
risk of insolvency. The 1990s saw a wide-
spread subnational debt crisis affecting many 
countries:  Argentina,  Brazil,  Colombia, 
Hungary, Mexico, the Russian Federation, 
South Africa, and others. What those coun-
tries needed, but lacked, was a regulatory

framework to strengthen subnational fiscal 
discipline (Liu and Waibel 2008).

Valuing creditworthiness
Even where subnational credit markets exist, 
it is hard to find useful and reliable informa-
tion on the creditworthiness of local govern-
ments in developing countries—one reason 
being a lack of transparency in municipal 
government  operations  (Kaganova  2011). 
Developed countries make information on 
creditworthiness  available  in  the  form  of 
bond ratings.

Colombia has promoted transparency by 
publishing traffic-light ratings of local pay-
ment capacity, with red, green, and yellow 
signals reflecting a combination of liquidity 
and solvency indicators. To rate municipali-
ties’ subnational debt, a red light identifies 
those whose ratio of interest to operational 
savings exceeds 40 percent and whose ratio 
of debt stock to current revenues exceeds 80 
percent. Red-light municipalities cannot bor-
row. Green-light municipalities can. Yellow-
light municipalities can borrow only after 
obtaining the approval of the central govern-
ment (Liu and Waibel 2008).

In 2010, the Municipality of Lima, Peru, 
obtained a loan to finance urban infrastruc-
ture. As a first step, the city received donor-
supported technical assistance to apply for 
a credit rating from an international rating 
agency. The outcome was a $70 million com-
mercial bank loan from BBVA Banco Con-
tinental to the municipality. This loan took 
Lima a large step forward to securing long-
term financing—its maturity was double that 
of the city’s previous debts, making debt ser-
vice payments more affordable and freeing 
municipal revenues to cover critical operating 
expenses. The loan was partially backed by 
a $32 million guarantee from the Interna-
tional Finance Corporation (Samad, Lozano- 
Gracia, and Panman 2012; IFC 2012).

An example involving the water sector is 
found in Kenya. The Water and Sanitation 
Program, together with the Water Services 
Regulatory Board in Kenya, recently com-
pleted an effort to establish utility shadow 

credit ratings for 43 urban water supply pro-
viders. In the process, they found that 13 
would be likely to be rated A or BBB credit-
worthy and 16 BB; these high credits scores 
may open the door for private commercial 
finance on the local bond market for these 
local water suppliers. 

Giving smaller cities access to capital 
markets: bond banks and resource pools
Smaller cities may be unable to gain direct 
access to long-term credit because they lack 
the  required  financial  infrastructure  and 
local capacity. In such cases, city leaders can 
instead seek short- or medium-term loans 
from higher levels of government through 
specialized donor-funded entities, such as 
municipal  development  funds.  Or  finan-
cial institutions can pool capacities to set up 
municipal local government financial inter-
mediaries, or bond banks (Samad, Lozano- 
Gracia, and Panman 2012).

Developed  countries  with  bond  banks 
include Belgium, Finland, France, Spain, and 
Sweden, as well as Canada with its munici-
pal finance corporations (mostly provincial 
agencies operating at the provincial level) and 
the United States with its municipal bond 
banks (state instrumentalities operating at 
the state level). Funds may not be available 
for all projects through bond banks, but they 
are an important source of funding for cities 
(Kaganova 2011).

In Colombia, a successful bond bank is 
FINDETER (Financiera de Desarrollo Ter-
ritorial),  a  government  company  created 
to  finance  regional  urban  infrastructure 
projects.  More  than  90  percent  nation-
ally owned, with the remainder owned by 
the Departamentos, FINDETER provides 
resources to financial intermediaries who 
assign them to regional authorities. It has 
received funds from multilateral banks and 
has consistently received very high credit 
ratings (see spotlight D) (Samad, Lozano- 
Gracia, and Panman 2012). 

Another way to give smaller cities access 
to capital markets is through resource pools. 
India  has  pooled  smaller  municipalities’

resources for this purpose. The first step 
was to rate municipal credit using a national 
methodology. In 1995, this methodology was 
applied to the Ahmedabad Municipal Corpo-
ration by Credit Rating Information Services 
of India Limited. And in 1996, Ahmedabad 
received a rating for bond offering. In 1998, 
Ahmedabad issued India’s first municipal 
bond without a state guarantee—a Rs 1 bil-
lion bond to finance a water supply and sew-
erage project. Used in combination with fis-
cal and management reforms (to computerize 
accounting, improve tax collection, and the 
like), the bond issue helped Ahmedabad turn 
a fiscal deficit into a surplus.

In  2001,  the  government  of  India 
announced guidelines for tax-free munici-
pal bonds. Its aim was to create incentives 
for local governments to improve their fiscal 
management and meet the demands of capi-
tal markets. Again, Ahmedabad was first to 
issue the bonds: in 2002, it borrowed Rs 1 
billion through a 10-year tax-free bond with 
9 percent annual interest.

Because only larger municipalities such as 
Ahmedabad were able to obtain the credit 
ratings needed for municipal bond issues, 
the  government  of  India  took  a  further 
step: it created special mechanisms to help 
smaller municipalities pool their resources 
and jointly access credit. The government’s 
Pooled Finance Development Fund Guide-
lines are meant to encourage small munici-
palities in undertaking the fiscal, financial, 
and institutional reforms that will give them 
access to market funds (Vaidya and Vaidya 
2008; World Bank 2011a).

Another example in India is the Tamil 
Nadu  Urban  Development  Fund,  which 
converted  from  a  state-owned  municipal 
development fund into India’s first financial 
intermediary, with private sector capital and 
management participation. It has successfully 
mobilized financial resources from the capital 
market, through various innovative financ-
ing schemes and helped small municipali-
ties develop PPP projects such as the Build, 
Operate, and Transfer (BOT) project—for 
example, the Karur Bridge BOT and Alandur 
wastewater BOT (see spotlight D).

Is  resource  pooling  the  best  way  for 
smaller cities to obtain credit? The jury is still 
out. Pooling can be difficult, as a highly rated 
government may be reluctant to lend weaker 
governments the benefit of its credit rating. In 
such cases, a more realistic alternative is par-
allel financing: each municipality borrows on 
its own terms—based on its creditworthiness 
and ability to pay—to finance a common 
project (Isabel Chatterton, personal commu-
nications, May 2012).

Bond banks and resource pooling—with 
guarantees—can be used to reduce the risk 
of smaller government debt. Yet neither is a 
substitute for establishing the foundations of 
creditworthiness in local governments (box 
3.1). City leaders can help cities establish 
their creditworthiness by (Pethe and Ghodke 
2005):

•	 Creating	credible	accounting	mechanisms.
•	 Creating	 sound	 financial	 management	

systems.

•	 Requiring	 the	 independent	 auditing	 of	

local government finances.

•	 Requiring	 performance	 evaluations	 for	

local government services.

Finally, it should be recalled that capital 
markets—in assessing the risks of municipal 
government debt—will strongly prefer invest-
ment projects designed to cover costs through 
pricing mechanisms (World Bank Institute 
and PPIAF 2012).

Besides bond banks and resource pools, 
another option for accessing credit is private 
financing through PPPs. Such partnerships 
are likely to favor cost recovery through user 
fees in service provision. And they can work 
well—if they follow rules that are clearly 
established in advance.

private finance using clear 
and consistent rules 
Traditionally, urban infrastructure financing 
has come from higher government levels—
which raise the funds through taxes—and 
from  government-owned  or  government-

BOX 3.1  Subnational debt finance: Making it sustainable

State and local government debt, and debt of quasi-
public agencies have been growing in importance. 
Rapid urbanization, with unprecedented rural-to-
urban migration, will continue to demand massive 
urban infrastructure investments—investments that 
largely have been decentralized to subnational gov-
ernments in many countries. Developing countries 
invest an annual average of 3–4 percent of GDP in 
infrastructure, well short of what is considered to 
be required (7–8 percent). The scale and the sus-
tainability of infrastructure financing will criti-
cally depend on the subnational government’s fiscal 
sustainability.

The sovereign’s macroeconomic fundamentals 
will continue to be vital to the fiscal sustainability of 
subnational governments. Major international rating 
agencies generally cap subsovereign credit ratings by 
the sovereign credit ratings. A country’s macroeco-
nomic management and countrywide risks affect not 
only the broader economic, fiscal, and financial con-
ditions under which a subnational government oper-
ates, but they also place restrictions on its ability to 
raise funds.

Subnational debt sustainability will also require 
strong  regulatory  frameworks  for  borrowing, 
including the management of implicit and contin-
gent liabilities. Significant progress has been made 
in establishing ex ante fiscal rules for subnationals in 
various developing countries to reduce default risks. 
Newly decentralizing countries will need to develop 
regulatory frameworks for subnational debt instru-
ments before opening up subnational government 
access to financial markets. More also needs to be 
done in developing a robust ex post insolvency sys-
tem for debt restructuring in the case of subnational 
defaults. A sound insolvency system reduces the 
moral hazard of free-riding on common resources by 
individual subnationals and sends signals to finan-
cial markets about pricing risks and returns. 

Many  subnational  governments  have  created 
special-purpose vehicles to undertake infrastructure 
investments, often in partnership with private finan-
ciers and operators. Such vehicles can play an impor-

tant role in developing infrastructure networks that 
cut across the boundaries of subnational adminis-
trations. But the special-purpose vehicle operations 
must be within a transparent governance and finan-
cial structure to ensure that they do not become a 
means of circumventing borrowing limits or contin-
gent liabilities of their creators. 

Land asset–based financing is an additional and 
important source of subnational finance for urban 
infrastructure in many countries, as land is often 
the most valuable asset on the asset side of subna-
tional balance sheets. It can also create significant 
fiscal risks, including diverting proceeds for current 
expenditure and using land and other hard assets as 
collateral for debt instruments such as bank loans. 
The upswing in the value of hard assets in economic 
booms can lead to excessive borrowing; and the vol-
atility of land and real estate markets creates risks 
for nonperforming loans, which can create macro-
economic risks. 

The global financial crisis has brought home the 
importance of developing domestic financial mar-
kets, including subnational credit markets. Sub-
national governments or their entities in various 
countries  have  already  issued  bond  instruments 
(for example, in China, Colombia, India, Mexico, 
Poland, the Russian Federation, and South Africa). 
More countries are considering policy frameworks 
for facilitating subnational debt market development 
(Indonesia), whereas others are allowing selected 
subnational entities to pilot-test transaction and 
capacity-building activities (Peru). A competitive and 
diversified subnational credit market can help ensure 
the lowest cost and the sustainable availability of 
credit. This means opening access on equal terms 
to bank lending and bond issuance and prohibiting 
monopolies of “municipal or development banks.” 
Securities laws and market infrastructure are part of 
developing subnational credit markets.

sponsored banks and financial institutions. 
But because the political costs for these expen-
ditures have been borne at the national level, 
towns and cities have not always had strong 

incentives to manage risks wisely, to spend 
money efficiently, or to do what is needed for 
continued creditworthiness. Cities are more 
accountable for their own development when

BOX 3.2  Paying for infrastructure through ancillary services

When infrastructure services cannot easily cover 
their full cost through user fees, ancillary services 
can sometimes fill the gap.

For  example,  a  toll  road  operator  may  not  be 
able to set fees high enough to cover costs. But there 
is money to be made in roadside businesses. So city 
leaders can combine the toll road franchise with the 
right to lease out service concessions for hotels, res-
taurants, or gas stations at highway rest stops. Indeed, 
a toll road company might lease out the rights to real 
estate development along part, or all, of a highway.

In granting a highway concession, governments 
can thus auction off the full package of rights and 
obligations to obtain the best price for the whole. 
Similarly, one of the main revenue sources for an 

airport franchise is the right to operate or lease out 
concession services—shops, restaurants, and the 
like—at the airport. Such add-ons to basic infra-
structure service can make funding possible with-
out recourse to regular government budgets. And 
when infrastructure service is independent of fiscal 
processes, the government is better insulated from 
undue political influence.

Still, there is a danger that subsidies may become 
excessive and foster economically inefficient proj-
ects. So city leaders should routinely use cost-benefit 
analyses to measure the welfare increases that infra-
structure services are likely to produce.

the funds for that development are raised 
locally.

One way for cities to raise funds locally 
and demonstrate accountability is through 
PPPs. City leaders in developing countries—
where financial markets do not readily allow 
municipalities to access long-term credit—are 
especially likely to think about private partic-
ipation in urban infrastructure projects. 

Done  well,  PPPs  can  not  only  attract 
additional infrastructure financing but also 
improve  project  selection—ensuring  that 
selected projects are sustainable by subject-
ing them to private sector market selection 
mechanisms. In addition, PPPs can improve 
asset  utilization  and  favor  cost  recovery 
through user fees. User fees are not exclusive 
to PPPs, since governments also can charge 
users to cover costs. Yet governments may 
find it politically difficult to achieve full cost 
recovery through user fees. Using ancillary 
benefits to recover costs may also be a politi-
cally viable alternative (box 3.2).

In addition, it may be difficult or impos-
sible  for  the  government— even  after 
announcing that it will cover costs through 
a regime of user fees—to obtain financing for 
improvements in public infrastructure service 

provision. When services are to be publicly 
provided (or provided through state-owned 
enterprises), lenders do not always accept a 
government’s assurances about cost recov-
ery through user fees. Why? One reason is 
that lenders lack confidence in the govern-
ment’s commitment to fee collection (fees 
actually collected might differ from those 
initially announced). Another is that lend-
ers fear a diversion of fee revenues from cost 
recovery—their original purpose—to other 
uses. Uncertainty of demand may also be 
a concern. Finally, lenders can be wary of 
unpredictable leadership, wondering whether 
a state-owned service provider will have its 
revenues arbitrarily taxed or withheld by the 
government.

When lenders remain reluctant to extend 
credit even after user fees are announced, 
the government may have no choice. The 
only way for city leaders to restore credit and 
finance urban infrastructure projects may 
then be through the sale of public assets to 
private firms.2

Private participation is not a magic bullet 
against all challenges to infrastructure financ-
ing. Further, the contractual arrangements 
for PPPs can vary considerably depending

on the risk allocated to the private sector 
(table 3.1). Like any other financing source, 
PPPs require commitments from sustainable 
cost-covering tariffs or equivalent tax rev-
enues. Because long-term fiscal commitments 
depend on risky variables—such as costs, 
demand, or exchange rates—their cost can 
be difficult to assess. They may prompt over-
commitment from the government and exces-
sive fiscal risk, because the cost of guarantees 
offered may be hard to estimate (World Bank 
Institute and PPIAF 2012).

In  1990,  the  government  of  Colombia 
provided guarantees on toll road revenues, 
airport revenues, and payments to utility 
(power) companies under long-term purchase 
agreements. The government underestimated 
the risks of these guarantees—among other 
problems, demand was lower than expected. 
By 2005, the government had paid out $2 
million on the guarantees. Another example 
of underestimated risks is Korea. In 1990, 
Korea’s government guaranteed 90 percent of 
forecast revenue for 20 years on a privately 
financed road linking Seoul to a new air-
port at Incheon. Again, the government paid 
tens of millions of dollars every year because 
demand was lower than expected (World 
Bank Institute and PPIAF 2012).

In Bolivia, the government privatized the 
water supply system in the city of Cocha-
bamba, awarding a 40-year concession to 
the private consortium, Aguas del Tunari. 
The  contract  was  awarded  without  ade-
quate appraisal of the financial situation 
of the company. Once the concession was 
awarded,  rate  structures  were  modified 
resulting in increases of up to $20 in water 
bills, representing as much as 20 percent of 
incomes for local families. Subsequent vio-
lent protests led to Aguas del Tunari with-
drawing from the project. And in Poland, 
the government awarded a concession to 
the Gdansk Transport Company in 1997 
for building and operating a section of the 
highway between Gdansk and Torun. How-
ever, a key piece of PPP legislation was miss-
ing,  delaying  the  signing  of  the  contract 
by seven years (World Bank Institute and 
PPIAF 2012).

Note: There is no significant difference between a full concession and privatization of a 
monopoly franchise. Compare the French water concessions with English water privatization. 
An English private owner cannot decide to turn off taps nor can she dig up the pipelines 
and take them elsewhere. Both concessions and privatizations can be terminated for fault or 
even without fault. While the details of these two types of contracts may vary, the basics are 
no different.

In  short,  PPPs  are  not  a  substitute  for 
good financial management and good project 
evaluation. Examples around the world sug-
gest that when the risks are underestimated, 
feasibility studies overlooked, and financial 
sustainability ignored, failure is the result. 
Policy makers can benefit from PPPs, while 
avoiding their pitfalls, by following proven 
rules (box 3.3).

In South Africa, which has a long history 
of successful infrastructure financing through 
PPPs, the law that governs them was enacted 
in 1999. The regulation defines the process 
for creating a PPP, with the necessary require-
ments and approvals, and it spells out the insti-
tutional responsibilities of all entities involved. 
Each step in the process is clearly defined in 
an independent module, which can be updated 
separately as conditions change—making the 
regulation flexible and adaptable. The trea-
sury conducts approvals and reviews, evaluat-
ing projects with a focus on their affordability 
and value for money. And the auditor general 
oversees the entire process, auditing contract-
ing authorities annually to ensure that they 
follow the rules for PPP implementation.

In many jurisdictions, finally, a clear defi-
nition of property rights can provide stronger 
protection for investors than any promises 
by the state or its enterprises can. This form 
of collateralization can make finance flow 
to infrastructure ventures and help expand 
systems.

Implementing public-private partnerships—lessons from Chile and Mexico

Experience worldwide suggests that successful imple-
mentation of public-private partnerships (PPPs) hinges 
on several key rules. Among these is the need for 
strong public sector capacity, appropriate legal and 
sector framework, rigorous planning and risk assess-
ment through feasibility studies, transparent and 
competitive procurement, strong monitoring systems, 
and flexibility for adapting to unpredictable events. 

Chile’s road concession PPPs reflected these rules. 
Between 1993 and 2001, the government of Chile 
awarded contracts for 21 roads on a competitive 
basis. The bidding started with smaller projects in 
order to test the market while also minimizing the 
risk for the private sector. More than 40 Chilean and 
international companies from 10 countries partici-
pated in the bidding through 27 consortia. A clear 
and transparent procurement process, a focus on 

public awareness of the process, and a learning-by-
doing approach that allowed for adjustments during 
the process contributed to the success of these PPPs.
In contrast, Mexico’s road concessions were not 
as successful. Between 1987 and 1995, 52 PPPs for 
toll roads were awarded by the government of Mex-
ico. Average actual revenues for most projects were 
about 30 percent below forecasts while construction 
cost overruns averaged 25 percent. A short conces-
sion period (with a 15-year maximum) led to high 
tolls, which increased on average by $0.15 per kilo-
meter after the concessions were granted. This led to 
the government finally taking over 23 projects and 
paying outstanding debt to Mexican banks and con-
struction companies, representing about $7.6 billion.

Leverage existing assets to 
develop new assets

Cities can leverage the value of their assets—
mainly land—to finance public infrastruc-
ture. An advantage of land-based financing 
over other sources is that it usually generates 
more cash up front (CDIA 2010).

Auction mechanisms are often used to sell 
land in developing countries, which lack sys-
tematic land valuations. Some countries use 
land parcel auctions as a standard element 
in land management. Land auction data are 
not widely available—but three recent large 
transactions illustrate the revenue potential 
of land auctions (Peterson 2007; Peterson 
and Kaganova 2010):

•	 In	Cairo,	in	2007,	the	auction	of	3,100	
hectares of desert land for a new town gen-
erated $3.12 billion—an amount 117 times 
greater than the country’s total urban prop-
erty tax collections, and about a tenth the 
size of national government revenue. The 
proceeds were to be used to reimburse costs 
of internal infrastructure and build a con-
necting highway to Cairo’s ring road. 

•	 In	Mumbai,	in	2006–07,	the	auction	of	13	
hectares of land in the new financial cen-
ter—Bandra-Kurla Complex—generated 
$1.2 billion. That was more than 10 times 
the total 2005 fiscal spending of the Mum-
bai Metropolitan Regional Development 
Authority, and 6 times the total value of 
municipal bonds issued by all urban local 
bodies and local utilities in India in more 
than a decade.3 The proceeds were to be 
used primarily in financing projects iden-
tified by the Metropolitan Transportation 
Plan.

•	 In	Istanbul,	in	2007,	the	auction	of	an	old	
bus station and government building gen-
erated $1.5 billion—more than the city’s 
total 2005 fiscal expenditures and infra-
structure investments.4

Clearly,  land  sales  can  help  to  finance 
urban infrastructure and other investments. 
Yet city leaders should recognize that all 
successful land-based financing instruments 
require at least three kinds of rules to be in 
place (see chapter 1 on planning). First are 
rules to assign and protect property rights. 
Second are institutions for the valuation and

public dissemination of land values across 
various uses. Third is a strong legal frame-
work,  with  a  healthy  judicial  system  to 
handle disputes and oversee the land-based 
financing  process.  Furthermore,  a  single 
planning strategy should integrate land-based 
financing with urban land use planning.

Where  governments  want  to  continue 
owning land, leaseholds have emerged as 
another way of leveraging land’s value. They 
have been used extensively in China, where 
the government owns all land.5 Until 1994, 
the central government was allowed to col-
lect up to 60 percent of all land leasing rev-
enue. After financial reforms, it went down 
to  5 percent,  enabling  local  governments 
to capture a local revenue source (Peterson 
2007). China acquires leasable land through 
several sources. Often it moves administra-
tive buildings or state-owned enterprises to 
new sites—freeing up desirable spots to be 
leased—or it acquires rural land from col-
lectives on a city’s fringes (Peterson 2007). 
However, relying extensively on land leases 
as a revenue source risks creating inefficien-
cies (at least in the short term) by producing 
empty or underused new cities in the middle 
of nowhere. The essential principle is to lever-
age land to generate new assets, at the same 
time systematically linking this new revenue 
source to a city’s land use plans.

Land sales and leaseholds can generate 
initial capital to defray the first-time costs of 
infrastructure investments. But in the long 
run,  other  instruments,  such  as  property 
taxes and similar levies, must pay for the 
maintenance and expansion of public facili-
ties. In the United States, property taxes are 
the main source of revenue for local govern-
ments. By contrast, in developing countries, 
such taxes are still only a small percentage 
of local revenues—except in the largest cities, 
where they are becoming more important. 
One problem is that these taxes are often 
hard to collect in developing countries, where 
property values are not systematically defined 
and tax collection rates are low. 

Betterment  levies,  special  assessment 
taxes, and exactions respond to these chal-
lenges  by  linking  fee  payments  to  value 

increases driven by infrastructure improve-
ment.  The  funds  generated  are  used  to 
finance the infrastructure projects. To be 
sure, such projects do not pay their own way. 
Yet they mesh with local revenue generation 
and accounting efforts.

A  more  advanced  type  of  land-based 
financing, seen in the United States, is tax 
increment financing. It uses property tax 
increases  from  improvements  to  finance 
infrastructure investments. Like betterment 
levies, tax increment financing requires a 
well-established, functioning property tax 
regime.

Considered as financing sources for infra-
structure investment, land sales may appear 
simpler than levies, taxes, and exactions. Yet 
for land sales to immediately raise revenue, 
they also require strong institutions—partic-
ularly institutions of two types:

•	 Institutions	that	manage	land	assets	using	
transparent, robust municipal accounting 
methods.

•	 Institutions	 that	 determine	 leasing	 and	
sales prices (or floor prices in land sale 
auctions) by defining objective land valu-
ation techniques.

Furthermore, land sales are a one-time 
income flow—not a long-term flow to meet a 
city’s ongoing need for financing.

Betterment levies in Colombia and Peru 
Betterment  levies  are  payments  made  by 
affected  property  owners  who  help  fund 
infrastructure improvements based on the 
increased  value  of  their  property.  Special 
assessment taxes similarly collect payments 
from property owners within a designated 
area of improvement. The best-known sys-
tem  of  municipal  financing  through  bet-
terment  levy  collection  is  Colombia’s.  Its  
betterment levies, or contribución de valo-
rización, established in 1921, are now regu-
lated under a law passed in 1970. They have 
substantially helped to finance local proj-
ects, comprising 16 percent of Bogotá’s total 
income in the 1960s (rising to 24 percent in 
1993) and 45 percent of Medellín’s (Uribe 

76

2010; Borrero 2011).6 In Bogotá, as much as 
half of the city’s arterial road network was 
funded by betterment levies (Uribe 2010).

However, a recent study has found three 
internal challenges to Bogotá’s betterment 
levy system (Uribe 2010). They are:

•	 Institutional	limitations. At present man-
aged by the Instituto de Desarrollo Urbano 
(Urban Development Institute, IDU), the 
levies were marred until recently by incon-
sistent property value estimates arising 
from a lack of communication between the 
IDU and the cadastre office. Now, updates 
to the cadastral database enable the IDU 
to use the property values recorded in the 
cadastre. Efforts are under way to central-
ize data collection in the cadastre for the 
benefit of other institutions.

•	 Regressive	effects. Most betterment proj-
ects are carried out wherever residents can 

pay for them—so they end up benefiting 
the city’s more affluent areas.

•	 Poor	coordination	among	various	admin-
istrations. Although the IDU works with 
the planning department on betterment 
projects, the projects are not always con-
sistent with the city’s master plan.

Peru’s experience with betterment levies 
offers an instructive contrast with Colom-
bia’s. Concentrated in metropolitan Lima, 
betterment projects in Peru have yet to gain 
traction. Why? Because Lima presents them 
with  unique  challenges.  Although  Peru’s 
methodology for betterment levies is nearly 
identical to Colombia’s, a lack of training and 
of technical knowledge for implementation in 
Lima means that missteps are common. Over 
1990–93, of more than 500 public works 
projects begun in Lima, only 31 used better-
ment levy financing (Huayapa 2001).

BOX 3.4  Leveraging land to finance infrastructure: Four lessons from international 
experience

Strong	institutions	are	needed	to	make	land-based	
financing	instruments	work. Institutions are essen-
tial to clearly define property rights; to objectively 
value land using standard methods; and to support 
and oversee land management, land sales, and tax 
collection.

Land	sales	are	most	successful	when	coupled	with	
other	financing	sources,	such	as	a	system	of	prop-
erty	taxes. Although useful as an initial source of 
revenue for infrastructure investments, land sales 
are not a reliable source of long-term financing; for 
that, a tax revenue system is needed. 

Betterment	 levies	 and	 special	 assessment	 taxes	
bring	 revenue	 to	 municipalities	 based	 on	 the	
increase	in	land	value	from	public	improvements. 
The main challenge to betterment levies, in prac-
tice, is determining how to calculate the increases in 
property value due to improvements. Such determi-
nations require institutions for valuation and for the 
collection and publication of price data. A simplified 
solution has worked well in Bogotá: levies are not 
estimated for each parcel but linked to a citywide 

fee. The success of this system is attributable partly 
to major efforts at updating and maintaining a com-
prehensive cadastral database—but also to growing 
citizen participation and oversight. 

Development	and	impact	fees,	and	tax	increment	
financing,	are	seen	mostly	in	developed	countries—
because	their	success	requires	strong	institutions	
that	 many	 developing	 counties	 do	 not	 yet	 have. 
These instruments need a strong regulatory author-
ity to enforce fee collection and to ensure that fees 
are used only for their defined purpose. Clearly 
defined property rights are essential. Other prereq-
uisites for success include updated information on 
property values and a clearly defined methodol-
ogy for estimating a project’s impact on land and 
property values. And for tax increment financing, a 
well-developed property tax regime is also required. 
Unless  a  strong  property  tax  system  is  in  place, 
imposing development and impact fees and estab-
lishing tax increment financing may be unrealistic 
ambitions.

To succeed, betterment levies require the 
presence of several factors. One is strong 
institutions—to collect the taxes and to build 
project capacity. Another is a clear under-
standing among taxpayers of how the levy’s 
distribution is defined and how its benefits 
are calculated. Finally, a positive attitude 
among taxpayers is essential: encouraging 
citizen participation and working toward 
a strong tax payment culture are key steps 
toward the successful use of betterment levies 
(box 3.4). 

Land-based infrastructure financing has 
the biggest payoff where there is rapid urban 
growth. Rapid growth causes land prices to 
rise rapidly, creating an opportunity to gener-
ate significant revenue. Yet rapid growth also 
magnifies infrastructure investment needs, 
requiring significant sources of development 
finance. France, Japan, and the United States 
used land-based financing techniques most 
heavily during periods of rapid urban growth 
when there were large leaps in the scale of 
urban investment.

As city leaders consider financing infra-
structure with land-based instruments, they 
should also appreciate the risks (Peterson 
2007). Real estate markets are highly cycli-
cal. So if land financing is used to finance 
infrastructure broadly (rather than being 
dedicated to new development), it will add 
uncertainty to local government budgets. 
Furthermore, the large revenues associated 
with land transactions and urban infrastruc-
ture investment create incentives for abuse 
by intermediaries. Finally, there is a risk that 
high potential profits from land transactions 
will  transform  local  authorities  into  real 
estate developers, seeking their own profit 
over the citizens’ common welfare.

Notes
1.  Prices should cover costs wherever possible 
and should emerge through competition, or by 
regulations that mimic competition (discussed 
in chapters 1 and 2).

2.  This position is consistent with the strongest 
evidence on the superiority of private solu-
tions over public ones (Galal and Nauriyal 
1995). According to analyses of infrastructure 

privatization during its heyday in the 1990s, 
the main benefit from privatization was the 
relaxation of constraints on investment—lead-
ing  to  system  expansion  and  greater  over-
all benefits, as well as to the liquidity that 
can be critical for governments with credit 
constraints.

3.  Of course, comparing a one-time sale of land 
with annual fiscal spending should not prompt 
generalizations about the revenue potential 
of land sales compared with other financing 
sources. Without time-series data, it is not 
clear whether such land sales are fiscally sus-
tainable in the long run. 

4.  This property in Turkey was purchased by 
Sama Dubai with grand plans to build the 
Dubai Towers in Istanbul—to be the tallest 
skyscrapers in Turkey. However, the munici-
pality and developer could not come to terms 
on  the  impact  of  the  buildings  to  the  sur-
rounding area so the project has been halted 
indefinitely.  Meanwhile,  the  land  remains 
undeveloped. 

5.  The  United  Kingdom  and  Commonwealth 

countries are other examples.

6.  Medellín  discontinued  the  use  of  better-
ment levies in 2001 because of administrative 
challenges.

Innovations in municipal finance: 
FINDETER and TNUDF

Territorial 
In Colombia, commercial banks had no expe-
rience with lending to municipal governments 
until the early 1990s. However, the subsov-
ereign debt market has rapidly developed 
since, and has been stimulated by the finan-
cial intermediation of Financiera de Desar-
rollo Territorial (FINDETER). FINDETER, 
established in 1999 as a legally independent 
and quasi-public financial institution, acts as 
a second-tier lender encouraging commercial 
lenders (first-tier lenders) to directly finance 
municipal governments. By lowering the cost 
of  loans,  FINDETER  increased  commer-
cial banks’ willingness to lend to municipal 
governments.

FINDETER rediscounts loans that com-
mercial banks make to subnational borrow-
ers; this process makes it more financially 
attractive for commercial banks to lend to 
subnational  borrowers.  In  practice,  this 
means that a municipal government applies 
for a loan to a commercial bank. The com-
mercial bank and FINDETER then appraise 
the  proposal  and,  if  approved,  the  com-
mercial bank lends to the municipal gov-
ernment.  FINDETER,  in  turn,  lends  an 
agreed-upon amount at a discounted rate to 

the commercial bank. The commercial bank 
remains responsible for servicing its redis-
counted loan by FINDETER regardless of 
its own collection of debt services from the 
municipal government, thus absorbing all the 
credit risk. The municipal government also 
has to set up a special account into which 
intergovernmental payments flow. The com-
mercial bank has a senior right to intercept 
revenue if loan payments are due. The com-
mercial bank, in turn, endorses these liens to 
FINDETER. Thus, if a participating bank 
becomes insolvent,  FINDETER can still col-
lect its dues (figure SD.1).

FINDETER  has  encouraged  commer-
cial banks to offer municipal governments 
long-term loans at attractive rates. In addi-
tion, it provides long-term financing up to 
15 years, whereas typical maximum loan 
maturities are 3–5 years. From 1990 to 2003, 
 FINDETER has financed about $2 billion in 
loans in more than 700 municipalities, and 
from 2006 to 2010, it disbursed about $4 bil-
lion. In addition, FINDETER has maintained 
low levels of bad debt to under 2 percent. 

FINDETER has succeeded in establish-
ing itself as a viable financial institution. 
And although FINDETER initially relied

on donor support, primarily from the Inter-
American Development Bank and the World 
Bank,  revenue  from  existing  loans  has 
financed more than 78 percent of its activi-
ties since 2006. In addition, FINDETER has 
achieved an AAA local credit rating (from 
Duff & Phelps), which has helped accessing 
less expensive financing.

Tamil Nadu Urban Development 
Fund 
In the late 1990s, the government of Tamil 
Nadu in India faced the challenge of reduc-
ing the huge backlog of needed infrastruc-
ture investments and of meeting the under-
supply of basic urban services. The situation 
was caused by urban local bodies’ limited 
financial and technical capacity and lack of 
long-term financing. To solve these prob-
lems, the government established the Tamil 
Nadu Urban Development Fund (TNUDF) 
in 1996 as the first public-private financial 
intermediary in India, which aims to provide 
long-term financing for urban infrastructure 
in Tamil Nadu. Further, TNUDF’s broad 
scope includes attracting private capital into 
urban infrastructure and facilitating urban 

local bodies’ access to capital markets (figure 
SD.2).

TNUDF has an efficient institutional and 
managerial framework. They are an autono-
mous legal entity, outside the government, 
and also involve equity contributions from 
three Indian private financial institutions. 
This structure has facilitated a positive rela-
tionship with the private sector, and it has 
facilitated efficient investment decisions. 

TNUDF has mobilized private capital by 
issuing bonds and by facilitating innovative 
financing schemes such as credit pooling, 
securitization, and public-private financing.

•	 Bond	 issuance. In 2000, TNUDF suc-
ceeded in issuing domestic bonds ($59.3 
million equivalent) with an LAA rating, 
indicating high safety and moderate risk 
due to TNUDF’s strong financial posi-
tion. This was the first nonguaranteed and 
unsecured bond issuance by a financial 
intermediary in India. 

•	 Pool	financing. TNUDF facilitated a credit 
pooling facility for financing smaller urban 
local bodies, who face limited financing 
capacity. In this scheme, small water and 
sanitation projects were pooled together

in a single bond issuance, to be repaid 
through  project  revenue.  The  issuance 
received a rating of AA by Fitch Ratings.

•	 Securitization. TNUDF structured refi-
nancing of the Madurai Bypass, the first 
toll road project based on user charge. After 
the facility began generating revenue, the 
urban local body issued bonds to refinance 
the loan made by TNUDF at lower interest 
rates. The bonds were fully subscribed by 
banks and other investors.

•	 Public-private	partnership	(PPP)	financing:  
TNUDF  assisted  refinancing  of  Karur 
Bridge,  the  first  Build,  Operate,  and 
Transfer toll bridge in India, through PPP 
financing. The bond issue was backed by a 
contract that allows the builder/owner to 

increase the toll by 8 percent a year. The 
project included a substantial equity con-
tribution by the builder/owner.

A high loan recovery rate at around 98 
percent has allowed TNUDF to finance and 
support extended urban infrastructure proj-
ects (181 loans to 732 urban local bodies with 
a cumulative approved loan amount of $95 
million as of February 2002). Additionally, 
the success of TNUDF has been supported 
from various donors such as the World Bank, 
the Asian Development Bank, the Japanese 
International Cooperation Agency, and the 
KfW banking group in Germany.

Framework in action: 
Lessons from  
Urbanization Reviews

This chapter presents case studies of seven Urbanization Review pilot countries—Brazil, China, 
Colombia, India, Indonesia, the Republic of Korea, and Vietnam—with lessons from each.

BRAZIL 
Eighty-four percent of Brazil’s population 
lives in urban areas, and urban population 
growth is expected to drive future population 
growth. Over 1970–2000, the urban share 
of Brazil’s population climbed from 56 to 82 
percent (figure 4.1). Brazil’s cities generate 
about 90 percent of GDP. With this burgeon-
ing urban population, Brazil must success-
fully manage planning and connecting across 
the system of cities.

How Brazil is urbanizing
Large  urban  centers  (populations  greater 
than 100,000) dominate Brazil’s system of 
cities. While this system varies considerably 
by region, 60 percent of all municipalities 

The Brazil Urbanization Review has been prepared by a 
team led by Nancy Lozano-Gracia comprising Hyoung 
Gun Wang, Henry Jewell, Somik V. Lall, and Eugenia 
Suarez. Consultants involved in this work were Geof-
frey J. D. Hewings, Andre M. Maghalaes, Roberta de 
Moraes Rocha, and Marcelo E. Alves da Silva.

have populations greater than 100,000 (fig-
ure 4.2). These cities are more prevalent in 
the southeast, where 70 percent of the urban 
population lives in large urban centers and 23 
percent in metropolises (with an urban popu-
lation of more than 4 million). But Brazil’s 12 
metropolitan areas have been losing ground 
as smaller cities attract more people—the 
percentage  of  urban  population  living  in 
the 12 metropolitan areas rose between the 
1940s and 1970 but has fallen since. 

Home to the vast majority of the coun-
try’s population, Brazil’s cities are the center 
of economic activity. Today, Brazil mirrors 
the behavior of developed countries, where 
income  starts  to  disperse  as  the  country 
approaches high-income levels. The share in 
GDP of the 12 largest metropolitan areas has 
been declining slowly, from about 46 per-
cent in 2000 to about 43 percent in 2008. 
São Paolo and Rio de Janeiro led the decline, 
moving from about 33 to 30 percent in these 
eight years. Dispersion of GDP may also be 
related to the decline in productivity growth 
in the past years in larger cities, as well as 
to increased congestion, bad management,

percentage points. Access to piped water was 
already above 85 percent across cities at that 
time. While for other basic services such as 
sewerage the gap in access between city sizes 
is still large (more than 40 percentage points), 
it declined by 10 percentage points in those 
10 years. Considerable regulatory reforms in 
water and electricity in the second half of the 
1990s contributed to this success. And tariffs 
have helped extend the networks and expand 
access. 

Brazil’s system of cities follows the pat-
terns suggested by international experience, 
indicating that the system is well integrated 
and that different cities are performing dif-
ferent activities (figure 4.3). As one would 
expect in an integrated urban system, large 
cities are diversified and small and medium 
cities are more specialized. Between 1995 
and  2008,  the  Herfindahl-Hirschman 
Index1  for  production  activity  increased 
in medium cities, small cities, and mostly 
rural municipalities, suggesting more con-
centrated production activities. 

Location quotients2 for the 123 largest 
urban agglomerations confirm the national 
pattern. The largest cities have a strong con-
centration of high and medium-high tech-
nology  industries  like  publishing;  chemi-
cal products; and electrical, electronic, and 
transportation equipment. Computer-related 
industries and financial services are also clus-
tered in the largest cities. Medium cities host 
industries of medium technological levels, 
such as textiles and pulp and paper products. 
Low technology industries are most com-
monly in the smallest cities (Da Mata and 
others 2006; 2007). Different cities in Brazil 
seem to be performing different functions, as 
expected in a well-connected system.

and poor metropolitan coordination, among 
other problems (World Bank 2006).

Despite great population inflows into cit-
ies, Brazil has been closing the gap in access 
to basic services across city sizes. In 1990, the 
gap in access to piped water between small 
and  large  cities  was  about  30  percentage 
points; by 2000, this gap closed to about 13 

Urban challenges
Access to basic services 
Regional  and  within-city  disparities  in 
access to basic services persist. While Brazil 
has improved access to water and electric-
ity, there are still considerable differences 
in access to basic services across the urban 

P L A N N I N G ,   C O N N E C T I N G ,   A N D   F I N A N C I N G   C I T I E S — N O W

  85

system. The gap in access to piped water 
is closing. But the north region seems to 
be lagging. Average access to piped water 
in medium cities was below 60 percent in 
2000. Disparities are also wide within cit-
ies: while on average only 8 percent of total 
households do not have a bathroom within 
their house, the percentage in slum house-
holds is 12 percent.

These regional differences may lead to 
migrants  moving  for  the  wrong  reasons. 
When  people  migrate  in  search  of  better 
access to basic services, location decisions 
may lead to inefficient outcomes. These indi-
viduals may end up contributing more to 
congestion in large cities than to increases in 
agglomeration benefits. A study of Brazilian 
migration finds that higher wages in leading 
regions is a strong determinant of the deci-
sion to migrate. But it also finds that many 
individuals migrate in search of better access 
to basic services (Lall, Timmons, and Yu 
2009).

Connective infrastructure and transport costs 
Connective infrastructure is deteriorating 
due to lack of maintenance. Large invest-
ments in connective infrastructure in the 
1950s and 1970s paid off. But the paved road 
network has deteriorated, and overall road 
conditions are similar to those in the 1970s 
(World Bank 2006). Large portions of federal 
and state networks have paved roads that are 
old, without proper maintenance for many 
years. While less than 30 percent of the roads 
were considered of bad quality in 2000, by 
2007 that percentage rose to more than 40. 
Less than 35 percent of the roads were con-
sidered of good quality in 2007. Transport 
costs have risen steadily by around 5 percent 
per year. More important, in the past three 
years the highest increases appear to be for 
short-distance trips. 

Housing deficits
In  both  rural  and  urban  areas,  housing 
deficits are large. The urban housing defi-
cit represents between 60 and 90 percent of 
the total deficit, depending on the region.

Housing deficits in urban areas vary between 
7 percent in the south and 32 percent in the 
north. In rural areas, the deficits for these 
two regions are 9 and 44 percent, respec-
tively. While the housing deficit is larger in 
relative terms in urban areas, the number of 
units is much larger given the high urbaniza-
tion rate of the country. 

Urban density 
With density increasing in Brazil’s largest 
cities, congestion will worsen, making an 
efficient transport system even more impor-
tant. A city that wants to grow denser must 
recognize that a dense city is feasible only 
when workers can commute efficiently to 
their workplaces. Between 2001 and 2009, 
commutes up to 30 minutes appear to have 
remained  relatively  stable  or  declined  in 
most cities. But a combination of relocation 
of some major economic activities, changes 
in residential locations, and increased con-
gestion  generated  by  dramatic  growth  in 
car ownership have stretched commuting 
times in places like São Paulo and Salvador.

Congestion also leads to considerable envi-
ronmental impacts such as pollution.

High poverty and income disparities
Between 1991 and 2000, the number of peo-
ple living on less than half minimum wage 
declined only slightly.3 The northeast and the 
north have a considerably larger percentage 
in poverty than the leading region of south-
east. And the pattern across city sizes didn’t 
vary between 1991 and 2000: the largest 
metropolitan areas have less poverty than 
smaller cities and mostly rural municipalities. 
In all regions, the percentage of poor in small 
and medium cities is growing over time. The 
total number of poor is also higher in munici-
palities  with  smaller  urban  populations. 
More important, the number of poor in large 
cities has remained fairly constant.

Other challenges 
Brazil’s cities face metropolitan management 
issues and safety and crime control. Brazil’s 
metropolitan regions and other large agglom-
erations in many cases still lack metropolitan 
management, and planning is done at the 
municipality level.

Looking ahead
Planning
Stringent land regulations led to dramatic 
growth in slums in the last 60 years, and 
today  about  60  percent  of  urban  land  is 
under some kind of informality (World Bank 
2006). The annual growth of slum dwellers 
in cities in the 1980s and 1990s were 5.5 and 
3.9 percent, respectively—much higher than 
city population growth (2.4 and 2.0 percent, 
respectively) as a whole. The four largest cit-
ies (with populations more than 4.2 million) 
collectively have 3.6 million slum dwellers, 
accounting for 9.1 percent of the total popu-
lation (Lall, Timmons, and Yu 2009). 

Elasticity of housing supply in the formal 
market appears to be very low, limiting the 
degree to which the supply can respond to 
demand increases. The estimated housing 
supply elasticity is similar to that of Malaysia 

and the Republic of Korea, which are con-
sidered to have restrictive land regulations 
(Lall, Timmons, and Yu 2009). Using data 
for slum formation across Brazilian cities 
between 1980 and 2000, Da Mata (2006) 
shows that pro-poor land use regulations like 
minimum lot size encourage immigration of 
the poor and increase slum formation. But 
urban zoning regulations are found to have a 
positive effect on the growth of formal hous-
ing markets and city population. Urban zon-
ing regulations are likely to improve land use 
efficiency by facilitating timely infrastructure 
investments both in urban expansion and 
redevelopment. It is key to identify policies 
that increase the housing supply relative to 
population growth and improve the elastic-
ity of housing supply (Lall, Timmons, and Yu 
2009). 

Land regulations are just one of many 
exclusionary policies in the hands of local 
authorities that could lead to growing slums. 
There is evidence that during the dictator-
ship  localities  appeared  to  withhold  ser-
vices, measured as water connections, to 
deter in-migration of low-education house-
holds (Feler and Henderson 2011). These 
early strategic interactions—where localities 
respond to increases in service in other local-
ities by withholding their own service—led 
to the growth of many unserviced informal 
housing sectors. The implications of these 
policies are costly, as catch-up investments 
are required, and building infrastructure 
on developed neighborhoods is considerably 
more costly than greenfield development. 

Connecting 
Connective  investments  maintain  and 
enhance cities’ competitiveness. Previous con-
necting efforts seem to have paid off, leading 
to a well-functioning system of cities. But as 
Brazil moves toward higher incomes, it will 
be important to become more competitive. 
Considerable investments in infrastructure 
may be necessary. Investments in short dis-
tance trips are particularly important. 

Coordination across jurisdictions will be 
key to tackle the challenges in large cities.

Efforts to improve governance of metropoli-
tan areas will also be important to reduce 
disparities within the largest cities; coordina-
tion across jurisdictions would improve effi-
ciency in land use planning as well as provi-
sion of basic services. 

Notes
1.  The  Herfindahl-  Hirschman  Index  (HHI) 
provides a quantitative measure of the impor-
tance of a particular sector in a region. When 
the region is completely specialized, the index 
approaches one, while if no single sector domi-
nates the region, the index approaches zero.

2.  The location quotient, a measure of geographic 
concentration of an industry, is defined as the 
ratio of a location’s share of the industry’s 
employment to its share of national employ-
ment. Values above/less than 1 indicate that 
the location is relatively more/less specialized 
in the industry than the national average.

3.  Half minimum wage has been used in Brazil to 
define a poverty line. Households living with 
less than half minimum wage are considered 
poor and those living with less than a fourth 
are considered indigents (PNUD 2003).

CHINA 
China  embraced  the  urbanization  that 
accompanied its dramatic economic transfor-
mation. Roughly 1 of 10 people in the world 
is a resident of a Chinese city. The United 
Nations projects that Chinese urban dwell-
ers will increase from more than 622 million 
today to more than 1 billion by about 2030. 
How China manages its urban transforma-
tion will have considerable bearing not only 
for the Chinese economy and society, but for 
the world at large. 

How China is urbanizing
China’s urbanization has been characterized 
by spatial expansion—particularly in large 
cities. With monopoly powers on urban land 
supply, municipal governments have had con-
siderable influence on land conversion and 
use to accommodate people and economic 
activities. Cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, 
and Guangzhou have rapidly suburbanized. 
While population densities are greatest in the 
city core, population growth or urban expan-
sion is much higher in the fringe areas 30–40 
kilometers from the city center. 

Spatial expansion has been accompanied 
by higher land consumption per capita in 
these big cities, where higher incomes have 
bid up the demand for land and housing.

Economic prosperity is concentrated in 
large cities with good access to international 
markets (map 4.1). Urbanization—particularly 
urban concentration in the largest cities—has 
amplified economic progress. Cities with 2.5 
million or more people generate 76 percent of 
urban exports;1 and 62 percent of overall for-
eign capital is used in these cities. Proximity 
to international markets has been the main 
driver of urbanization and urban success.

The urban economic structure is more 
complex when looked at closely. For example, 
big cities tend to generate higher incomes, but 
there are large variations within each city size 

The China Urbanization Review has been prepared by  
a  team  led  by  Hyoung  Gun  Wang  and  comprising

group, likely due to economic geography con-
ditions and other local factors.

While overall poverty reduction has been 
impressive, the coastal-inland development 
gap and the rural-urban divide are the two 
major components of spatial inequality in 
China. Spatial transformations have stimu-
lated  progress  in  large  coastal  cities,  but 
many poor people in rural areas and small 
hinterland cities still need to be connected 
with prosperity. The rural poor account for 
91 percent of the total poor; and western 
provinces (north and south) account for more 
than 50 percent, though the western region 
represents  only  around  20  percent  of  the 
national population (World Bank 2008).

In  addition  to  rural-urban  and  broad 
regional divisions, the urban underclass is 
concentrated in second-tier cities (nonpro-
vincial capitals). The four largest provincial 
megacities (Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing, 
and Tianjin) have the lowest urban disadvan-
taged rate of around 1 percent. More than 80 
percent of the urban underclass lives in pre-
fectural or lower-level cities.

Urban challenges
Rural-urban land use conversion
Rural land can be transformed for urban 
land use only when the municipal govern-
ment purchases the land from rural com-
munes.  This  effectively  makes  municipal 
governments the monopoly supplier of urban 
land in the primary land market. 

Since 2001, the focus has shifted from a 
centrally planned system to a more market-
oriented system. Conveyance transactions 
have started to account for a larger share 
in  the  primary  market.  The  government 
sets principles and procedures to increase 
transparency. 

The rapid outward spread of cities has 
led to greater concern from the central gov-
ernment over the loss of China’s farmlands. 
The relatively small percentage of arable land 
(around 14 percent) has amplified this con-
cern, as has the government’s longstanding 
commitment to sustaining food self-suffi-
ciency for security reasons. Although China 

P L A N N I N G ,   C O N N E C T I N G ,   A N D   F I N A N C I N G   C I T I E S — N O W

  89

is committed to a strict policy of farmland 
protection,  many  local  governments  rely 
heavily on off-budget revenues from land 
lease  transactions  to  fund  economic  and 
infrastructure programs. 

Labor mobility
Under the hukou system, or regulations on 
household  registration,  every  Chinese  is 
assigned a hukou location with either agri-
cultural (rural) or nonagricultural (urban) 
hukou classifications. An agricultural hukou 
provides access to farmland, and a nonagri-
cultural hukou provides access to jobs, hous-
ing, food, and state-sponsored benefits. With-
out an urban hukou, unregistered migrants 
cannot have access to basic needs of urban 
life, including jobs, housing, and public and 
social services.

As local governments implemented various 
hukou reforms after the 1980s, local hukou 
regulations vary greatly from city to city. In 
general, it is more difficult to obtain a local 
hukou in a larger city than a smaller one. The 
hukou system is the main barrier limiting 
rural-urban migration, especially for large cit-
ies such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou.

Basic services
Recent policy initiatives indicate an increas-
ing government commitment to broader pov-
erty reduction, social protection, and human 
development. The quality of life in urban and 
rural areas has improved greatly in the past 
decade, measured by net income and Engel’s 
coefficient.2 And the rural-urban difference 
in the expenditure share on social services 
(education and health) diminished signifi-
cantly over 1990–2008. But the income dis-
parity between the urban and rural residents 
has widened over time. 

The overall quality of health services is 
a  cause  for  concern.  There  is  hardly  any 
improvement, and in some instances it is 
deteriorating. Local governments’ limited 
capacity to generate fiscal revenues contrib-
utes to poor basic services in small cities. 
More important, urban water infrastructure 
fails to provide sufficient water and meet 
ever-increasing urban demand.

Connecting cities
Massive infrastructure construction, par-
ticularly the national transport network, has 
largely driven China’s economic growth. The 
national transport network expanded rap-
idly. From 1990 to 2005, China completed 
nearly 41,000 kilometers of high-grade tolled 
expressways comprising the National Trunk 
Highway System, or the National Expressway 
Network (NEN). During this period, about 
400,000 kilometers of local and township 
roads were also improved. This expansion 
was funded by investments upward of $40 
billion a year, with about a third allocated 
to the NEN. The current NEN plan includes 
7 corridors radiating from Beijing, 9 north-
south corridors, and 18 east-west corridors. 
The strategy for defining the 7–9–18 plan 
combined radial and grid patterns to maxi-
mize coverage and transport connections. 

Despite China’s recent efforts to update the 
transport infrastructure, the logistics industry 
still needs to improve its efficiency to reduce 
associated costs. China’s expense on logistics 
accounted for 20 percent of the GDP—much 
higher than the United States (10 percent), 
Japan (14 percent), and the European Union 
(10–13 percent). A logistics performance study 
ranked China’s domestic logistics costs 72 of 
150 countries (World Bank 2007).

Connecting neighborhoods within cities
Chinese  cities  are  moving  toward  motor-
ized transport with rapid growth in the use 
of private cars and public transport. This is 
coupled with fast growth in inner suburb and 
outer suburb trips in large cities, where resi-
dential development has been concentrated 
recently. 

Nonmotorized travel, including walking 
and biking, continues to decline in favor of 
motorized trips on both public and private 
modes. Private motorized vehicles are gain-
ing a larger share of travel (Darido, Torres- 
Montoya, and Mehndiratta 2009). Similar 
trends can be seen for public transportation 
and taxis. Nonmotorized travel in big cities— 
including Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and 
Xi’an—has declined well below 50 percent, 
whereas the majority of residents in small 
cities travel to work by foot or bicycle. This 
indicates that each local urban transport pol-
icy should be differentiated according to its 
own city size and development rather than a 
one-size-fits-all approach.

The average portion of the transporta-
tion expenditure to discretionary income in 
Beijing, Shanghai, and the nation as a whole 
has risen steadily over the past few years. The 

proportion that the low-income group spends 
on transport has grown much faster in Bei-
jing, while Shanghai succeeded in making 
urban transport inclusive for low-income city 
residents. Without targeted interventions and 
investments, low-income urban residents will 
face greater pressure to manage travel expen-
ditures as cities expand and motorize. 

Financing
With  the  introduction  of  fiscal  contracts 
in 1988, the central government is no lon-
ger responsible for financing local expendi-
tures. Instead, the local government’s role 
expanded from providing public services to 
financing them as well. Local governments 
are responsible for a wide spectrum of gov-
ernment functions (box 4.1).3 

As transfers from the central government 
are  allocated  through  a  revenue-sharing 
mechanism, rich and big cities receive larger 
transfers than small cities (Mountfield and 
Wong 2005). Thus local governments’ ability 
to raise revenues either on- or off-budget is 
crucial for high-quality public services.

Local governments in larger cities generate 
disproportionately higher revenues per capita 
than smaller cities. Residents in large cities 

BOX 4.1  China’s urban infrastructure financing

Debt financing. To fill the gap created by the decline 
in direct budget spending, local governments have 
primarily turned to borrowing. In 2001, commercial 
bank loans accounted for more than 30 percent of 
infrastructure investment by local governments. The 
central government strongly encouraged this policy, 
identifying urban infrastructure investment as a 
top priority for banks. And this lending was seen 
as implicitly guaranteed by the central government. 
The central government also issued infrastructure 
bonds and passed the proceeds to provincial and 
local governments as a mix of on-lending and grants. 

Marketization. “Marketization” describes the mobi-
lization of capital from the private sector to invest in 

urban infrastructure. The national planning agency 
is increasingly calling for this mode of financing to 
replace the declining share of direct budget financ-
ing. There are two key elements to the marketization 
financing. 

First, marketization financing earns proceeds 
from land leasing—that is, the sale of leasing rights 
owned by the local government to private develop-
ers. Leasing rights, typically for 40–70 years, are 
sold up-front as a cash transaction. 

Second, the local governments are increasingly 
moving toward “privatizing” existing infrastruc-
ture assets. This can be viewed as a way of attract-
ing private capital to help finance new infrastructure 
projects.

enjoy better access to high-quality public ser-
vices, as their local governments can generate 
more revenues in both absolute and relative 
terms.

Looking ahead
China’s urbanization should amplify the pace 
of economic prosperity and enhance living 
conditions across the country’s vast land-
scape. Public policy and investment need to 
generate win-wins for urban efficiency and 
social inclusion. As other parts of the urban 
system start benefiting from more prosperity, 
the management of urbanization and urban 
land consumption is likely to have consider-
able bearing on urban productivity, mobility, 
and sustainability.

COLOMBIA
Seventy-five percent of Colombians live in cit-
ies. Bogotá, home to 7 million, is Colombia’s 
largest city, with 18,000 people per square 
kilometer—the densest in the western hemi-
sphere. Together with Cali, Medellín, and 
Barranquilla, the largest cities account for 
30 percent of the country’s population and a 
high proportion of its jobs. At the other end 
of the spectrum lie 927 municipalities with 
fewer than 20,000 people, dispersed across 
the  national  landscape.  How  city  leaders 
manage the urban system will impact Colom-
bia’s chances of transitioning from a middle-
income to a high-income country.

How Colombia is urbanizing
Colombia, as much of Latin America, has 
enjoyed positive economic growth in the 
past  few  years,  mitigating  the  potential 
adverse consequences of the global financial 
crisis. These gains came on the back of high 
commodity prices, improvements in macro-
economic and financial management, diver-
sification of trading partners—particularly 
through  stronger  links  with  China—and 
safer integration into international financial 
markets (World Bank 2011). While Colom-
bia is still highly dependent on commodities, 
urban activities are central to its growth. 
Urban activities have contributed to more 
than 50 percent of GDP growth over the 
past four decades.1

Strengthening cities’ contribution can help 
mitigate the risks inherent to commodity-
intensive economies and support the move

from a commodity-driven economic system 
to a stronger resource-based manufactur-
ing structure and then toward knowledge- 
intensive industries (Sinnott, Nash, and de la 
Torre 2010). High-income countries such as 
Australia, Canada, the Scandinavian coun-
tries, and the United States have evolved simi-
larly (Blomström and Meller 1991; De Fer-
ranti and others 2002). Almost 80 percent of 
Colombians live in urban areas, where unem-
ployment rates are above 12 percent—among 
the highest in the region. 

Urban challenges
What  key  drivers  will  enable  Colombia’s 
urban system to cash in on its growth divi-
dend? The Colombia Urbanization Review 
focuses  on  three  priorities:  enhancing 
planning  coordination  at  a  regional  and 
metropolitan  scale,  deepening  economic 
connections across cities, and fostering effi-
ciency and innovation in how cities finance 
themselves. 

Enhancing coordination for better planning
Colombia  is  one  of  the  most  decentral-
ized countries in Latin America. More than 
1,000 municipal governments have identical 
responsibilities for basic infrastructure ser-
vice delivery, land use and economic devel-
opment planning, and provision of social 
services. But the footprint of urbanization is 
frequently greater than municipal boundar-
ies. The metropolitan area of Bogotá covers 
seven municipal jurisdictions (Bogotá, La 
Calera, Chía, Cota, Funza, Mosquera, and 
Soacha) and has a population of about 8.1 
million. This occupation pattern is not pri-
marily sprawl—Bogotá is one of the most 
densely populated cities in the world. And 
this spatial pattern is not unique to Bogotá. 
Firms  and  households  in  other  large  and 
medium cities are increasingly spilling across 
the boundaries of core municipalities, driven 
by natural economic forces including access 
to affordable land. 

Metropolitan  areas  in  Colombia  face 
crippling inertia and bottlenecks in plan-
ning land use and strategic investment. The

benefits  of  coordinated  land  use  include 
the development of productive and logistics 
infrastructure and of structural drainage and 
flood protection infrastructure and the effi-
cient spatial organization of economic activi-
ties. Despite the benefits that may arise from 
interjurisdictional coordination, many politi-
cal economy challenges discourage coordi-
nated services and planning across adminis-
trative boundaries.

In decentralized systems like Colombia, 
local  administrators  and  politicians  face 
strong disincentives to coordinate regional 
actions. Resistance often emerges to aggrega-
tion or “clawing back” of power and respon-
sibility from the municipal level. 

Deepening economic connections
Colombia’s geography poses serious chal-
lenges for interregional transport. As early 
as 1927, studies have noted that the natural 
and economic geography poses a particular 
challenge for transport in Colombia (Renner 
1927; Stokes 1967). Many cities are dispersed 
across  mountainous  terrain  and  far  from 
coastal ports. Bogotá, the country’s primary 
production center, is more than a day’s drive 
from the Atlantic or Pacific coasts, where 
agricultural products for export, fossil fuels, 
and raw materials are concentrated. Because 
many imports and exports are processed in 
maritime ports, freight travels long distances 
in  Colombia.  A  2006  study  showed  that 
freight distances in Colombia were almost 
three times those in Brazil and Chile, five 
times those in Malaysia, and six times those 
in Argentina, China, and the Republic of 
Korea.

In Colombia, physical distances are exac-
erbated by economic distances. Costs for 
freight transport on domestic roads from 
Bogotá to the Atlantic are about $94 per ton, 
while international maritime transport to the 
United States is about $75 per ton. Moving 
products from Bogotá to Barranquilla costs 
$88 per ton, and Bogotá to Buenaventura 
$54 per ton. Shipping goods from Cartagena 
or Buenaventura to Rotterdam or Shanghai 
is about $60 per ton—that is, less than the 
transport  costs  from  Bogotá  to  the  ports 

for the Atlantic and slightly higher for the 
Pacific. Logistic costs are also high. 

Fostering efficiency and innovation in financing 
Smaller municipalities are highly dependent 
on transfers from the national government. 
About 70 percent of the revenues of small 
municipalities come from national transfers, 
compared with about 30 percent for the larg-
est municipalities. Heavy reliance on transfers 
may weaken accountability, as the politi-
cal costs of raising funds are borne at the 
national level and not directly where they are 
spent. This is important because service qual-
ity remains a major challenge in Colombia. 

Earmarking transfers for spending in par-
ticular sectors may not be sufficient to ensure 
quality improvements without mechanisms 
to measure the investments’ effectiveness. 
Excessive reliance on earmarking could also 
encourage fiscal laziness, as municipalities 
lack the incentive to raise revenue and direct 
it to specific local needs. And evidence sug-
gests that heavy reliance on transfers can lead 
to inefficient spending. 

While municipal tax collection has risen 
with  decentralization  and  administrative 
reforms across all categories of cities, small 
and medium cities have not kept pace with 
larger cities in their ability to increase local 
revenues. Municipal capacity to raise prop-
erty taxes is closely connected to the effi-
ciency of the cadastral system: there is a posi-
tive correlation between property tax revenue 
and the cadastral system’s accuracy. Only 
Bogotá, Medellín, and Cali have independent 
cadastre offices, and all others are handled 
at the national level. Large cities have more 
comprehensive land cadastres. Bogotá has 
attained 100 percent registration of land. 
By contrast, only 43 percent of rural areas 
are included within the national registration 
system. 

Looking ahead
Coordinating
The government has an important role in 
aligning incentives and fostering coordina-
tion among local governments. International

experience demonstrates that national gov-
ernments  and  urban  areas  have  success-
fully responded to changing conditions by 
reforming interjurisdictional coordination 
arrangements. The role of national govern-
ment  is  to  build  a  framework  and  create  
the right incentives for coordination. This 
may  include  strengthening  metropolitan  
governance  structures  through  building 
capacity, expanding metropolitan competen-
cies, regulating and promoting cooperation 
structures, and developing coordinated proj-
ects between the national and regional gov-
ernments. Financial incentives can also pro-
mote horizontal coordination. 

Efforts to increase coordination across 
jurisdictions are particularly timely in light 
of new legal reforms. The new law regu-
lating spatial planning—Ley Orgánica de 
Ordenamiento  Territorial—responds  to 
the  need  to  develop  a  clear  institutional 
framework  to  support  the  aggregation 
of municipal functions and coordination 
between territorial entities. The law opens 
spaces for voluntary collaboration in insti-
tutional interjurisdictional arrangements 
and enables the formation of organizational 
entities (commissions) to collaborate on ter-
ritorial planning issues. But it does establish 
clearly defined coordination responsibilities. 
Its pending regulation will present a critical 
opportunity for the government to ensure 
the new legal framework has the ability to 
claw back excessive decentralization.

Connecting
Lowering  transport  costs  will  catalyze 
growth and improve overall efficiency across 
the system of cities in Colombia. The Colom-
bia Urbanization Review identified two pos-
sible ways to reduce costs: improvements to 
intermodality and investments in specific cor-
ridors that will face high congestion as soon 
as 2020. 

A preliminary simulation analyzing the 
competitiveness of three modes (truck, rail, 
and waterways) suggests that more competi-
tion across modes would bring considerable 
cost savings. The simulation suggests that, 
given limited access to marine terminals, 

trucking  is  the  most  cost-effective  mode 
for distances less than 300 kilometers. For 
medium distances, rail is the most cost-effec-
tive, and for distances beyond 700 kilometers 
river transport is the most cost-effective. Dis-
tances from Bogotá to the Atlantic coast are 
roughly 1,000 kilometers, suggesting a large 
benefit from greater modal diversity. 

And from a demand-side perspective, the 
two main corridors identified as medium-
term priorities are the route along the eastern 
mountain chain, connecting Bogotá to the 
Atlantic Coast ports, and the route connect-
ing the highlands to the Pacific ports (from 
Bogotá  to  Buenaventura).  Note  that  the 
demand models used in this assessment factor 
in today’s ongoing pipeline investments (such 
as Ruta del Sol, along the Bogotá-Atlantic 
Coast Corridor). Even with these investments 
factored in, projected growth in demand will 
cause substantial congestion on these routes 
as early as 2020. 

Reduced transport costs resulting from 
connective  investments  and  competition 
across modes will likely alter the distribu-
tion of trade across the system of cities. It will 
also open new opportunities for places and 
products that were constrained by high costs. 
Rather than focusing on picking winners and 
losers, national policy should aim to reduce 
market and government failures—here the 
market failures, related to infrastructure pro-
vision, that impede trade among Colombian 
cities and between them and the rest of the 
world. 

Financing
A strong push is required to strengthen the 
fiscal fundamentals for small and medium 
cities. This might be done through increased 
capacity building in municipal fiscal manage-
ment, strengthened local cadastral systems, 
and the structuring of fiscal and performance 
incentives within the national transfer sys-
tem. In the face of considerable infrastruc-
ture finance gaps, medium and large cities 
must find new ways to finance urban infra-
structure. Cities will require diversified strat-
egies, including increasing access to munici-
pal bonds and credit markets, elaborating

existing land-based financing instruments, 
and accessing municipal development funds 
and  specialized  financial  intermediaries. 
Colombia is a leader in land-based financ-
ing instruments in Latin America. But these 
innovative  land-based  financing  instru-
ments have had limited penetration beyond 
Colombia’s large cities, where they have also 
run into capacity and technical constraints. 
Medium and large cities should also create 
new instruments for infrastructure financ-
ing such as tradable development rights, land 
sales and leases, tax increment financing, and 
private-public partnerships for urban redevel-
opment and renovation. 

The national government has a broader 
role in supporting the financial efforts of cit-
ies. More systematic data on expenditures 
as well as close monitoring and evaluation 
would clarify the impact of specific condi-
tions, such as earmarking, on efficiency of 
investment. The government may also con-
sider developing and deepening efforts to 
support fiscal capacity at the municipal level, 
targeting assistance strategically within the 
“system  of  cities”  approach.  Efforts  may 
include creating programs to develop munici-
pal  cadastres  in  medium  cities,  targeting 
technical assistance across the system of cit-
ies in investment planning and fiscal manage-
ment, and working with medium cities on 
municipal creditworthiness.

The  government  may  also  analyze  and 
develop greater performance-based incentives 
within the Sistema General de Participaciones 
framework to improve the efficiency and effec-
tiveness of the transfers and overall munici-
pal investment. And the government has a 
unique opportunity to structure the regional 
development fund within the context of the 
Royalties Law (Ley de Regalias) to create the 
right incentives for strategic investment plan-
ning and development. Allowing this fund to 
be a formula-driven transfer to departments 

would merely reproduce past errors in the roy-
alties system. The royalties fund for regional 
development should be designed with strong 
performance-based criteria, filter investment 
priorities through a “system of cities” techni-
cal framework, and create incentives for effec-
tive cooperation across municipalities and 
between departments.

INDIA
Identifying  options  for  accommodating 
urban expansion is gaining importance in 
India’s policy discourse. Since 2001, another 
90  million  people  have  joined  the  urban 
ranks, and 250 million more are projected by 
2030. The challenge—as well as the opportu-
nity—is extremely high population densities 
in and around the largest metropolitan areas. 
Population  densities  in  the  50-kilometer  
vicinity of the largest metropolises average 
2,450 people per square kilometer. And a 
third of India’s new towns were “born” in a 
50-kilometer neighborhood of existing cities 
with more than one million people.1

If these trends are any indication of the 
future, much of India’s urbanization chal-
lenge  will  be  to  transform  land  use  and 
expand infrastructure in its largest cities and 
neighboring suburbs—places that are not 
pristine or greenfield but already support 9 
percent of the country’s population and pro-
vide 18 percent of employment on 1 percent 
of its land area. So far, high population densi-
ties have not been accompanied by commen-
surate substitution between scarce land and 
durable capital or built-up area.

How urbanization is managed has impli-
cations for economic efficiency and spatial 
equity. For economic efficiency, it is impor-
tant to learn where the transformation is 
occurring and whether productivity gains 
through agglomeration economies are being 
adequately tapped. Are policy distortions sty-
mying such benefits, and can specific reforms 
reduce the inefficiencies? For spatial equity, it 
is important to learn whether the benefits of 
the transformation are spreading geographi-
cally and whether policies can help spread 
economic activities. 

The India Urbanization Review was prepared by a 
core team led by Tara Vishwanath, consisting of David  
Dowall,  Somik  V.  Lall,  Nancy  Lozano-Gracia,  
Siddharth  Sharma,  Eugenia  Suarez,  Hyoung  Gun 
Wang, and Cheryl Young. The policy discussion in 
this report was framed following extensive discussions 
with the Planning Commission and the Ministries of 
Urban Development and Housing and Urban Poverty 
Alleviation.

How India is urbanizing
An assessment of India’s urbanization high-
lights considerable stability in the spatial 
distribution of people and jobs. One would 
expect rapid economic concentration in large 
metropolitan areas with good market access 
following economic liberalization, as in China 
during the 1980s and in other Asian countries 
following economic integration. But India’s 
metropolitan areas have not gained discern-
ibly in economic activity. True, the seven 
largest such areas have the highest concentra-
tion of economic activities that benefit from 
urbanization economies—information and 
communication technology (ICT), machine 
tools, rapidly growing export manufactur-
ing, and supporting services. But these met-
ropolitan areas have been stagnant in recent 
years (figure 4.4). Over 1993–2006, they did 
not increase their overall shares in national 
employment—not even in industries that typi-
cally benefit from agglomeration economies, 
such as ICT and high-tech manufacturing.

The cross-country experience, that met-
ropolitan concentration increases until per 
capita income levels of $7,000–$10,000 are 
reached, suggests that the liberalization of 
industrial investment in the 1990s should 
have led to greater economic concentration 
in India’s metropolitan areas. The stagnancy 
of these metropolitan areas in recent years 
points to three overlapping scenarios.

First,  industry  in  India  has  not  grown 
rapidly, thus reducing the demand for urban 
agglomerations that can provide localization 
and urbanization economies. But this is not 
entirely convincing as India has developed 
niche markets in ICT services and specialized 
manufacturing that it trades with the rest of 
the world. And there has been considerable 
growth in low-end manufacturing that is 
consumed and traded internally. By looking 
at differences between Karnataka and Tamil 
Nadu—India’s  high-growth  states—it  is 
becoming clear that economic geography has 
a role to play in influencing specializations 
across urban areas. 

Second, India’s cities have some of the 
most restrictive rules on conversion of land

Note: The metropolitan core is an area with a 10 kilometer radius, centered on the main metropolis. Suburban towns include urban areas 10–50 kilometers 
from the metropolitan core. Suburban villages include rural areas in the same vicinity. These figures are averages for the seven largest metropolitan areas 
(Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore, Kolkata, Chennai, Hyderabad, and Ahmedabad).

for urban use and on the intensity with which 
land can be used to accommodate industry 
and commerce. For example, even though the 
standard practice in cities with limited land 
is to raise the permitted floor space index 
(FSI) over time to accommodate growth, the 
Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai 
lowered the permitted FSI to 1.33 in 1991 
(World Bank 2008). In this otherwise liber-
alized policy environment, stringent regu-
lation on development densities is pushing 
businesses and people out of urban centers. 
The constraints on land use are also mak-
ing housing expensive, pricing out poor and 
middle-class households from urban centers.
Third, all metropolitan suburbs—whether 
officially classified as rural or urban—are 
experiencing an industrial boom. At 41 per-
cent, the pace of manufacturing employment 
growth is fastest in the rural areas adjacent to 
the largest metropolitan areas. Even though 
high-tech and other emerging manufactur-
ing industries are moving away from the cen-
ters of metropolitan areas, they are relocat-
ing to the suburbs and peripheries of these 
same cities, rather than to smaller cities. And 
although metropolitan suburbanization is a 

worldwide phenomenon, it usually happens 
at  middle  to  advanced  stages  of  develop-
ment.2 India’s early suburbanization suggests 
that the overall stagnancy of metropolitan 
areas is partly due to firms being pushed out 
of the cores. The growth of metropolitan 
suburbs is possibly a reaction to these draco-
nian land policy regulations. But the journey 
to the suburbs is costly for firms and work-
ers. Transport costs for freight are among the 
highest between the metropolitan core and 
its periphery, and infrastructure access and 
quality of water, electricity, and sanitation is 
much worse at the urban periphery relative 
to the core. 

Urban challenges
Rigid land use policies
Urbanization brings higher demand for land, 
and a problem arises when land is scarce 
where it is needed most. India lacks many of 
the institutions—such as a transparent sys-
tem to convert land use, a clear definition 
of property rights, a robust system of land 
and property valuation, and a strong judicial 
system to address public concerns—that are

needed to facilitate land markets and make 
it easier to accommodate land transactions 
and land use changes. While stronger insti-
tutions governing land use conversion, land 
valuation,  and  property  rights  definition 
and adjudication emerge, and land markets 
mature over time, India may want to look at 
alternative options for the short and medium 
term. Land readjustment is gaining accep-
tance as an alternative to land acquisition as 
it has many advantages for land assembly. 
Essentially a participatory tool, land read-
justment to a great extent avoids the public 
discontent and protests that land acquisition 
may generate.

Sprawl and escalating property prices
Managing densities within cities is another 
challenge in accommodating urban expan-
sion, as is financing urban expansion and 
city renewal. Urban regulations such as FSIs 
limit densification in Indian cities, capping 
densities at levels much below international 
good practice. And India’s cities have blan-
ket FSIs that cover large areas, thus missing 
opportunities to strategically increase density 
around infrastructure networks. Granularity 
in FSI design and coordination of land use to 
exploit infrastructure placement is the bed-
rock of good urban planning (as in Seoul and 
Singapore). 

Commuting and freight transport
While urban land and building regulations 
limit  densities  in  metropolitan  cores  and 
push people and firms to the outskirts, defi-
cient connections are exacerbating these con-
straints. If a good transport system is in place, 
people can make efficient tradeoffs between 
how much they consume and its quality, and 
the distance they travel to work. But conges-
tion presents a major challenge for Indian 
cities. Narrow roads, combined with perva-
sive growth of private car ownership, lead 
to motorized journey speeds in all cities that 
are barely faster than riding a bicycle. While 
motorization is on the rise, public transport 
has not been able to serve the expanding 
mass of urban commuters. Discussions with 
urban transport experts suggest that even 

though several initiatives increase the supply 
of public transport, limited integration with 
other modes of transport and land use plan-
ning reduces its use. 

Just as urban transport is key to connect-
ing people with jobs, an adequate logistics 
infrastructure is needed for city businesses 
to reach local and regional markets. Mar-
ket access provides incentives for firms to 
increase production scale and specialize. But 
as businesses suburbanize, they face higher 
costs to connect with urban markets. Freight 
costs between metropolitan cores and their 
peripheries are as high as Rs 5.2 ton per kilo-
meter ($0.12)—twice the national average of 
Rs 2.6 and more than five times the cost to 
move products in countries such as the United 
States. Much of the high transport costs are 
due to use of smaller and older trucks as well 
as a higher share of empty backhauls without 
a return load. Trucks on these routes clock 
about 25,000 kilometers a year, a fourth of 
what they need to be economically viable. 
Logistics management systems and collabo-
ration  and  consolidation  with  competing 
truckers and trucking associations can help 
internalize  the  network  externalities  and 
reduce metropolitan freight costs.

Spatial disparities in access to basic services
Access to and quality of basic services both 
matter for living standards of households 
and performance of firms. India has a long 
way to go to provide universal access to basic 
services. Access to services such as sewerage 
and drainage facilities worsen as city size 
decreases, with small towns and rural areas 
suffering from the lowest access levels. Two 
factors drive these differences: fragmented 
institutional responsibilities between state 
and central governments, and regulations 
that keep tariffs low and do not allow utili-
ties to be financially sustainable, making 
them unable to expand services.

Looking ahead
Planning
To accommodate urban expansion, India 
needs to change its urban planning “License

Raj.” Getting urban planning right is essen-
tial for economic prosperity. Urban planning 
systems across the country limit urban expan-
sion, redevelopment, modernization, and the 
repurposing of older, inefficient areas. In set-
ting out to relax these constraints, Indian 
policy makers could embark on “big bang” 
reforms such as those in Hong Kong SAR, 
China; the Republic of Korea, and Singa-
pore—which followed a big push model of 
“managed urbanization” led by a strong and 
often intrusive state. But this approach could 
face high political and social risks. Another 
option—which may be more conducive to 
India’s democratic and federal system—is to 
pursue an incremental model of experimenta-
tion focusing on a few areas (such as infra-
structure corridors and neighborhoods) and 
then scaling up based on community-level 
consensus building. This will also allow for 
learning from alternative approaches and 
lead to capacity building at the local level. 

Responsibility for urban reforms
Who is responsible for implementing urban 
reforms in a federal country where national, 
state, and municipal jurisdictions overlap? 
Some very local- or neighborhood-level deci-
sions  on  densification  and  infrastructure 
planning are often decided at the state level; 
and the guidelines on land valuation are con-
currently handled by national and state gov-
ernments with some inputs from the districts 
(not  the  municipalities).  Similarly,  urban 
basic services such as water supply are often 
provided  by  state-level  public  health  and 
engineering departments, often missing out 
on economies of scale and scope that could 
come from differentiating service options 
across settlements with varying densities.

Metropolitan-wide horizontal coordination 
Beyond the implementation challenges of ver-
tical coordination, the rapidly increasing spa-
tial footprint or suburbanization of India’s 
urban areas is creating a disconnect between 
what is “urban” and what is “municipal,” 
calling  for  metropolitanwide  horizontal 
coordination. International experience points 
to several criteria for designing metropolitan 

governance structures, including efficiency 
in exploiting economies of scale and ability 
to reduce negative spillovers across munici-
pal boundaries, equity in sharing costs and 
benefits of services across the metropolitan 
area, accountability for decision making, 
and local responsiveness. Agencies such as 
the Bangalore Metropolitan Region Devel-
opment Authority and the Mumbai Metro-
politan Region Development Authority have 
been instituted to facilitate metropolitan-
wide functional and investment coordina-
tion. But the jury is still out on the effective-
ness of these institutions in performing their 
intended roles and of their ability to manage 
efficiency, equity, and accountability across 
metropolitan areas. 

Notes
1.  Of the 1,108 new towns “born” between 1991 
and 2001, 35 percent were in urban fringe 
areas within 50 kilometers of medium and 
large cities of more than 1 million people.

(1999).  Gregory  Ingram  (1998)  highlights 
that the general trend of urban development 
included  dispersal  from  the  center  to  the 
periphery of both population and employment, 
with the largest metropolitan areas converg-
ing to decentralized and multiple subcentered 
areas.

INDONESIA 
The spatial structure of urban growth and 
development in Indonesia will shape eco-
nomic growth over the next 15 years, deter-
mine the quality of life for urban dwellers, 
and define the competitiveness of Indonesia’s 
cities. To foster productive clusters of eco-
nomic activity, the government of Indonesia 
needs to encourage efficient urban spatial 
structures, appropriate and timely invest-
ments in critical large-scale infrastructure in 
cities, spatially comprehensive basic services, 
effective urban management, stronger institu-
tional capacity, and proactive horizontal and 
vertical coordination of local government 
actions. 

Urbanization  is  a  path-dependent  pro-
cess. Once a city is built, the constructed 
areas, along with the institutional relations 
that now manage the city, become increas-
ingly locked-in. The most important task is 
to engage in proactive planning and man-
agement of the city in order to leverage the 
opportunities generated by agglomeration 
economies.

By  2025,  more  than  two-thirds  of  the 
country’s population will be urban. This pres-
ents a major opportunity: urbanization can 
boost regional economic growth and create 
vibrant cities and metropolitan areas. Urban-
ization and the agglomeration economies 
that it generates will be central to Indonesia’s 
development as a middle-income country. If 
managed properly, urbanization can generate 
the productivity gains, rising incomes, and  
economic opportunities needed to support 
the growing middle-income population.

The  Indonesia  Urbanization  Review  was  prepared 
by a team led by Peter Ellis, and included Rumayya 
Batubara, Arish Dastur, Jennifer Day, David Dowall, 
Blane Lewis, Harun al-Rasyid Lubis, Edy Priyono, 
Arlan Rahman, Arief Ramadhian, Wilmar Salim, Rulli 
Setiawan, Renata Simatupang, Thalyta E. Yuwono, 
and the Urban and Regional Development Institute. 
Ira Marina provided excellent logistical support to the 
team and formatted the report. Country counterparts 
included Bappenas, the Ministry of Transportation, and 
representatives of the governments of Jakarta, Sura-
baya, Medan, and Makassar.

Urbanization in Indonesia will continue 
to be rapid. In absolute terms, the country 
is expected to add 56 million people to its 
urban areas over the next four decades. While 
demographic and economic concentrations 
around the Jakarta metropolitan region, and 
more generally across Java and on Bali, will 
continue to dominate the country’s economy, 
urbanization is also accelerating in the coun-
try’s medium-size cities (map 4.2). 

How Indonesia is urbanizing
Over the past 20 years, Jakarta has done 
well despite an influx of residents and serious 
infrastructure challenges. Surabaya’s per cap-
ita growth in gross regional domestic product 
(GRDP) has been slightly weaker, as it did 
not fully recover from the 1997 crisis, but its 
growth has been steady since 2003. Medium-
size cities have experienced the strongest per 
capita growth in GRDP, along with strong 
to moderate population growth. Small cities 
have performed the weakest, with declines in 
population and per capita GRDPs. Trends in 
land, population, infrastructure, investment 
climate, and economic sector data indicate 
that the medium-size cities have managed to 
leverage urbanization for economic growth 
very well.

Population growth is most rapid in the 
suburban  ring  of  the  metropolitan  areas.

More than 70 percent of all urban popula-
tion growth between 1996 and 2007 took 
place in the suburban areas of multidistrict 
metropolitan regions. This fact points to two 
phenomena: first, many metropolitan regions 
are gradually deconcentrating their centers as 
they grow into their peripheries; and second, 
this expansion cuts across multiple jurisdic-
tions, often with conflicting interests. This 
requires mechanisms that optimize and coor-
dinate development at a scale more complex 
and much larger than the city core. 

Urban challenges
Land markets
Land markets are constraining the economic 
development of cities. Local and provincial 
governments  need  to  enable  and  manage 
dynamic land markets. This is possibly one of 
the biggest bottlenecks Indonesia faces as it 
urbanizes. Land acquisition processes based 
on government valuations of land are lengthy 
and cumbersome, causing long delays and 
relaying costs to projects and infrastructure 
construction. 

Except for Medan, metropolitan regions 
are sprawling as real estate developers and 
businesses find it easier, cheaper, and faster 
to develop projects in outlying areas. This 
also follows the international patterns of 
decentralization of manufacturing. These 
trends indicate that metropolitan areas are 
rapidly expanding into outlying areas, and 
as a consequence, driving population den-
sity downward (Firman 2000). Currently, 
three phenomena are apparent in Indonesia’s 
metropolitan areas: many metro regions are 
gradually deconcentrating their centers as 
they grow into their peripheries; periphery 
areas need to be prepared to receive indus-
try—and this expansion spans across mul-
tiple jurisdictions, often with conflicting 
interests. The data on urban land use and 
population, when combined with GRDP, 
clearly illustrate the strong and positive cor-
relation between economic density (GRDP 
per  urban  land  area)  and  productivity 
(GRDP per capita).

Infrastructure and service delivery
Growth  in  the  larger  metropolitan  areas 
is also constrained by a lack of large-scale 
investments and within-city challenges in 
infrastructure delivery. Access to basic ser-
vices—clean  water,  sanitation,  electric-
ity, and roads—are generally limited and 
unequally distributed across regions. About 
55 percent of households in Indonesia have 
access to safe drinking water, but only 15 
percent comes from piped water. Access to 
safe drinking water is higher in urban areas 
(78 percent) than rural (49 percent). Per-
pamsi (Association for Local Water Utilities 
Providers) recorded that 403 local govern-
ments (kota/kabupaten) out of almost 500 
local governments have piped water facili-
ties, but the outreach of the service is still 
very limited.1

While access to clean water and sanita-
tion is limited, access to electricity is rela-
tively higher. Almost 98 percent of urban 
households used electricity from Perusahaan 
Listrik Negara (PLN, the state electricity 
company), while the national rate reached 89 
percent. However, this rate varies across the 
region, as there are provinces with less than 
50 percent access to electricity.2 

Coordination 
Lack of coordination greatly affects metro-
politan regions that need coordinated land 
use and spatial planning to foster economic 
efficiency. With most new urbanization tak-
ing place outside central cities—DKI Jakarta, 
Surabaya,  Makassar,  Bandung,  and  oth-
ers—metropolitan areas cannot effectively 
plan for future growth or develop budgeting 
mechanisms to finance needed infrastruc-
ture. In some cases, infrastructure invest-
ments are not coordinated and road projects 
stop at district or provincial boundaries. In 
others, independently developed urban land 
use plans do not consider the economic trans-
formations in a region, and land use is not 
structured to foster economic development 
and boost economic development. This may 
be one of the most significant factors holding 
back the development of some of the largest 
secondary cities.

Transportation
Because of its uniquely archipelagic geogra-
phy, Indonesia requires an extensive system 
of maritime ports that are efficiently man-
aged and well connected with urban and 
rural regions. It is important to invest in 
water-based transport systems and reduce 
shipping costs to foster interregional trade. 

Looking at the split between transporta-
tion modes, however, it is clear that Indo-
nesia has not begun to make greater use of 
water-based transport systems. Improving 
both terrestrial and maritime transporta-
tion by lowering costs and improving the 
quality and timeliness of goods and people 
movement will generate manifold benefits: 
increased  economic  integration  between 
regions as well as opportunities to develop 
supply chains between small, medium, and 
large cities. Highway construction and main-
tenance has not kept pace with the country’s 
need to develop strong links with regions. 

Looking ahead
Planning 
The government needs to fully implement its 
laws and regulations regarding intergovern-
mental coordination and metropolitan-scale 
management of spatial planning, as the lack 
of intergovernmental coordination is ham-
pering effective spatial planning. District 
plans are not well aligned with those of con-
tiguous districts, and they are not consistent 
with the plans of their provinces. 

National  laws  and  regulations  for  the 
preparation of local (district and provincial) 
plans  should  be  amended  to  incorporate 
infrastructure capital investment programs 
needed for spatial plan implementation. In 
the case studies done for this project, we 
encountered numerous cases where planning 
was not integrated with infrastructure and 
financing programs. Part of this limitation is 
due to unclear legislation, lack of compliance, 
and limited local capacity to link spatial and 
infrastructure planning with financial pro-
gramming. Spatial plans do not appear to 
fully inform the financial budgeting process 
of local government agencies.

Complex land rights systems hinder eco-
nomic  development.  In  the  public  sector, 
the  costly  and  time-consuming  processes 
to acquire rights-of-way for infrastructure 
projects impede construction. Private sector 
entities are more efficient in land acquisition 
because they are more flexible and realistic 
with compensation, but the complexity of 
the acquisition process drives them to subur-
ban areas were land parcels are larger and, 
therefore, fewer transactions are typically 
needed. This promotes fragmented urban 
development and undermines agglomeration 
economies and urban revitalization. Systems 
of guided urbanization, such as land pool-
ing and readjustment, might be part of the 
broader solution.

The  government  needs  a  multifaceted 
strategy for managing urbanization to fur-
ther leverage regional growth. Indonesia’s 
urban  development  strategy  needs  to  be 
focused along two dimensions. First, it must 
make spatial planning and investment priori-
ties between tiers of government—national, 
provincial, and local—more consistent. Sec-
ond, it must stratify local governments along 
size characteristics: the two largest metro-
politan  regions,  second-tier  metropolitan 
areas, rapidly agglomerating medium-size 
cities, and small cities. Urban trends need to 
be linked with the Economic Transformation 
Master Plan.

Consistency between spatial plans and 
investments needs to improve. This requires 
coordinating spatial planning between levels 
of government and among districts compris-
ing metropolitan areas, so that plans and 
investment priorities are more closely aligned 
with investment priorities. Investment plans 
for large-scale infrastructure also need to 
take into account the impact on urban land 
markets. Greater investment is needed in 
critical  infrastructure  (electrical  power, 
transit, surface and maritime transportation 
networks, and basic services). For example, 
industrial and business and consumer ser-
vices districts need to be developed and pro-
vided with better transportation accessibility 
to residential zones.

Connecting
The government needs to connect rapidly 
agglomerating metropolitan and medium-
size cities. These cities have adequate infra-
structure and do not suffer from poor spa-
tial structure, but they need more and better 
infrastructure and connections with major 
centers and ports. As these cities continue to 
agglomerate, they should maintain their capi-
tal investment programs. Sound spatial plan-
ning and land management can help these 
cities  enhance  productivity,  and  regional 
transportation investments can provide an 
additional boost.

For Java and Sumatra, the government 
should consider constructing trans-Java and 
trans-Sumatra highways to improve the effi-
ciency of surface transportation. A trans-Java 
corridor would create a strong link between 
Jakarta and Surabaya, as well as links in sec-
ondary cities such as Bandung, Semarang, 
and Yogyakarta.

Financing 
Local governments that are urbanizing need 
to increase both the level and effectiveness 
of their capital expenditures, or else risk 
severely constraining economic growth. The 
capital expenditures of local governments 
have a significant and positive influence on 

district  economic  growth.  Local  govern-
ments  that  are  relatively  more  urbanized 
or have relatively larger urban populations 
(or both) spend less on capital projects than 
other local governments. Capital expenditure 
needs to be increased in more urbanized local 
governments.

THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA 
Already at an advanced stage of urbaniza-
tion, the Republic of Korea differs from the 
other case studies in this report. Through 
coordinated planning and connecting poli-
cies, Korea successfully managed its journey 
from incipient to advanced urbanization. 

Korea  has  had  rapid  economic  growth 
since the 1960s, attracting considerable inter-
est from the rest of the world. Through the 
1950s, Korea was so poor that people had 
trouble  securing  even  one  meal  a  day.  In 
1962, its per capita gross national income  
was only $76, and total national exports 
were $55 million.

To address economic development and 
urbanization,  Korea’s  government  imple-
mented the Five-Year National Economic 
Development Plans and the National Ter-
ritory Comprehensive Plans. Due to these 
plans, Korea began a journey of economic 
progress with an average economic growth 
of 22.6 percent in the late 1960s. High eco-
nomic growth continued until the 2000s, 
when Korea had the 15th largest GDP. Korea 
joined the Organization for Economic Coop-
eration and Development in 1996 and hosted 
the G-20 Summit in 2010. How did Korea 
do it?

How Korea urbanized
Korea’s  urbanization  can  be  divided  into 
three stages: incipient (1920s to 1960), inter-
mediate (1960 to 1990), and advanced (1990s 
and on). 

Incipient urbanization 
The rate of urbanization in 1920 was 4.86 
percent, but it rapidly increased to 23.8 per-
cent by 1944. After the Korean War in the 

The Korea Urbanization Review is based on the report 
Urbanization and Urban Policies in Korea, which was 
produced by Korea Research Institute for Human Set-
tlements (KRIHS). The authors of this report include 
Jaegil Park (lead author), Daejong Kim, Eunnan Kim, 
Keuntae Kim Yongseok Ko, and Keunhyun Park at 
KRIHS.  The  Korea  Urbanization  Review  was  pre-
pared in close collaboration between Somik V. Lall and 
Hyoung Gun Wang from the World Bank and KRIHS  
in 2010.

1950s, social and political chaos frequently 
broke out, leading to a high concentration of 
population in urban areas. As a result urban-
ization increased to 36.8 percent by 1960. 

Intermediate urbanization 
Rapid  urbanization  took  place  between 
1960 and 1990. From 35.8 percent in 1960, 
urbanization reached 82.6 percent by 1990, 
a 46.8 percentage point increase. Thus after 
1960, urbanization increased an average 15.6 
percent every 10 years. In this urbanization 
phase, about 60 percent of the urban popula-
tion lived in large cities (populations of more 
than 1 million). And concentration of urban 
population in satellite cities around the capi-
tal grew. The proportion of urban population 
living in the capital region rose from 21 per-
cent in 1960 to 43 percent in 1990.

Advanced urbanization
Urbanization reached a plateau in the late 
1990s at about 90 percent. Between 1990 
and 2000, it increased from 83 percent to 94 
percent, and remained almost unchanged at 
96 percent as of 2005. Concentration of the 
urban population in the capital region contin-
ued (48 percent in 2005). Some residents liv-
ing in the core of metropolitan cities started 
to relocate to neighboring cities and satellite 
towns with populations between 200,000 
and 1 million. 

The evolution of urbanization policies 
in Korea
Korea’s progress from incipient to advanced 
urbanization  involved  four  policy  areas: 
urban planning and land management, hous-
ing supply policies, connecting policies, and 
slum and low-income housing policies. 

Before the introduction of a comprehen-
sive urban planning system, land develop-
ment programs were established, followed by 
a land use regulation system. Korea suffered 
greatly from its housing shortage, with no 
apparent housing polices during the incipi-
ent and intermediate urbanization periods. 
Housing  shortages  were  solved  to  some 
extent by the massive housing construction 
plans in the early 1990s.

The transportation system was completed 
in the following order: first, the railroad sys-
tem at the incipient stage, followed by the 
express highway system in the intermediate 
urbanization period, and then the metropoli-
tan highway and high speed railroad system 
in the advanced period. 

In the intermediate period, policies that 
cleared  and  relocated  slums  were  imple-
mented  in  response  to  spatial  division  in 
urban areas, but with no success. In the early 
advanced period, the decline of slums was 
driven mainly by the strong market forces in 
the residential redevelopment projects. 

Throughout  the  urbanization  process, 
urban planning and land management have 
been considered the most important policy 
areas.

Urban planning and land management
In the incipient urbanization stage, mod-
ern land ownership and land management 
institutions were established. The Land Sur-
vey Act (1912) and the Urban Planning Act 
(1934) defined the rights of land ownership 
and land use. 

Established in 1962, the Land Acquisi-
tion Act provided an institutional means for 
appropriate compensation in purchasing land. 
Public works projects greatly increased dur-
ing this period, and the Exemption Act for 
Public Land Acquisition and Compensation 
was introduced in 1975 to facilitate public 
land acquisition with proper compensation. 
It provided uniform evaluation criteria, meth-
ods, and processes to acquire lands for public 
works.

Residential development projects for the 
sale and rent of affordable housing were first 
adopted through the Public Housing Act in 
1963, but land development was still carried 
out through land readjustment projects. In 
1966, the Korean government established the 
Land Readjustment Act and separated it from 
the existing Urban Planning Act. The Urban 
Redevelopment Act was newly established 
and separated from the Urban Planning Act 
in 1971. In 1973, the government instituted 
the Promotion Act of Industrial Base Devel-
opment to develop industrial sites and pro-
mote industrialization. The act provided a 

legal basis to purchase lands within the area 
designated as industrial districts, including 
compulsory acquisition.

During this intermediate stage of urban-
ization,  several  complementary  measures 
were required for a number of reasons. For 
instance, zoning decisions and urban plan-
ning facility projects were amended too fre-
quently by the mayors and county leaders. To 
solve this problem, the Urban Comprehensive 
Plan—which provides guidelines for 20-year 
urban planning visions, zoning decisions, 
and urban planning facilities—became man-
datory. And downtown development projects 
were implemented according to phased devel-
opment scenarios in the Urban Comprehen-
sive Plan.

As urbanization was under way at full 
speed, urban development projects greatly 
increased, and goals, subjects, and types of 
development projects became diverse. But 
too  many  acts  and  measures  were  estab-
lished, leading to confusion within the urban 
development system. In the late 1990s, a 
movement to integrate and reorganize urban 
planning  acts  emerged.  For  example,  the 
National Land Use and Management Act, 
established in 2002, integrated the Urban 
Planning Act and the National Land Use 
Management Act, which had separately con-
trolled urban and nonurban areas. It played 
a major role in spreading urban planning 
throughout the country. 

In the 1990s, the number of registered 
vehicles greatly increased, and transportation 
infrastructure rapidly expanded. Coopera-
tion between the city and the national gov-
ernment was emphasized to accommodate 
urban infrastructure. As a response to these 
regional planning issues, metropolitan city–
regional planning, which requires coopera-
tion between the city and the county or the 
city and the province, was institutionalized in 
2000.

Housing supply policies
Although providing sufficient housing units in 
response to rapid urban population growth is 
necessary to meet basic infrastructure needs, 
housing supply policies were not a major con-
cern during the incipient urbanization stage.

In the intermediate urbanization stage, how-
ever, housing shortages became serious social 
issues and gradually worsened due to rapid 
urban growth. 

Recognizing this problem, the government 
built a large number of housing units. Because 
of the scarcity of urban land and high popu-
lation density, it encouraged the construction 
of apartments rather than houses. Its hous-
ing construction policies, such as the Hous-
ing Construction Promotion Act (1973) and 
the Two Million Housing Construction Plan 
(1988–92), led to large-scale residential devel-
opment focused on apartment construction. 
Due to these policy efforts, the most serious 
housing problems were largely solved in the 
advanced urbanization stage.

Connecting policies
Because the Kyoungbu (Seoul-Busan) rail-
road was built in 1904, and a railroad net-
work had already been established in the 
early Japanese colonial period, Korea was 
prepared for a more modern urban struc-
ture in the incipient urbanization stage. In 
the intermediate urbanization stage, road 
networks based on expressways were built, 
contributing to the development of nation-
wide transportation systems. In the latter 
half of the intermediate urbanization stage, 
urban highways and subway lines were built 
to meet rapidly rising demand in large met-
ropolitan areas. In the advanced urbaniza-
tion stage, the Korea Train Express (KTX, 
the bullet train) was constructed, shrinking 
the entire nation into a half-day travel zone. 
In  the  2000s,  regional  highways  such  as 
the Seoul Outer Beltway were constructed 
in major metropolitan cities to meet metro-
regional transport demand.

The government considered trunk trans-
port infrastructure a core component of the 
national economic development planning. 
The first Five-Year Economic Development 
Plan (1962–66) devoted 64 percent of the 
total investment in transportation to rail-
roads. The second Five-Year Plan focused  
on metropolitan roads and a “public road–
centric” structure. The third to fifth Five-
Year Plans focused on expanding expressway 

capacities. The sixth (1987–91) emphasized 
pavement projects, increasing the pavement 
ratio from 54 to 76 percent.

Slums and low-income housing policies
In  the  incipient  urbanization  stage,  land 
ownership by a few landlords or the ruling 
class forced farmers to lose their land and 
move to urban areas. In the intermediate 
stage, industrialization provided incentives 
for rural people to move to cities for job 
opportunities. While this concentration of 
rural population in urban areas was in prog-
ress, many deteriorated low-income neigh-
borhoods (slums)—such as shanty towns and 
poor hillside settlements—formed within 
urban areas. 

Later in the intermediate urbanization 
stage, these neighborhoods were removed for 
more efficient land use, and many apartments 
replaced these poor-quality houses. Dense 
slums were greatly reduced in the advanced 
urbanization stage. But the residents from 
these slums were scattered over outer metro-
politan areas or satellite cities, living in sub-
standard places such as in building attics or 
basements.

Looking ahead
Urban planning and land management insti-
tutions  were  adopted  to  respond  to  chal-
lenges in each urbanization stage and proved 
their effectiveness. Investments in connective 
infrastructure contributed to the successful 
urbanization process by improving the eco-
nomic efficiency of the national urban system 
as well as that of individual cities. Construc-
tion of the KTE line helped reduce travel time 
dramatically, forming a spatial structure suit-
able for the advanced urbanization stage. 

But the absence of housing supply policies 
from incipient to intermediate urbanization 
stages continuously raised housing and land 
prices. As a solution, increased housing sup-
ply, through direct and indirect government 
interventions, helped stabilize housing prices, 
but demand for high-quality residential envi-
ronments still poses heavy financial burdens 
on the national and household economy.

VIETNAM 
Vietnam will have only one chance to get 
urbanization right. If we fail at urbaniza-
tion, we will fail at industrialization and 
modernization.
—Deputy P. M. Nguyen Sinh Hung, speak-
ing at the Vietnam National Urban Confer-
ence, November 6–7, 2009 

Vietnam is now widely considered a devel-
opmental success story. Driven by the Doi 
Moi reforms that began in 1986, Vietnam 
has rapidly evolved from one of the poor-
est countries in the world to an emerging 
 middle-income country. In about 25 years, 
living standards have tripled, poverty has 
fallen  by  80  percent,  and  gross  national 
income per capita has risen from less than 
$100 to more than $1,000. With its accession 
to the World Trade Organization in 2007, 
Vietnam emerged as a global and regional 
powerhouse: international trade represents 
160 percent of GDP, exports have risen by 
14 percent annually over 2006–10, and many 
industrial exports have grown much faster. 
As of 2011, Vietnam attracted more net for-
eign direct investment commitments than 
Indonesia,  the  Philippines,  and  Thailand 
combined (World Bank 2011b). 

The  country’s  long-term  development 
prospects are solid, but the sustainability of 
its growth will necessitate a shift from reli-
ance on low-cost labor and natural resources 
exploitation to a greater focus on produc-
tivity growth and technological advances 
while also ensuring greater macroeconomic 
stability (World Bank 2011a). Urbanization 

The World Bank’s Vietnam Urbanization Review was 
led by Dean Cira, and prepared by a core team con-
sisting of Arish Dastur, Henry Jewell, Austin Kilroy, 
Nancy Lozano-Garcia, Huyen Thi Phuong Phan, and 
Hyoung Gun Wang. The team benefited from the stra-
tegic guidance provided by Stephen Karam and Somik 
V. Lall. The consultants and firms that helped prepare 
background reports for this work are Alain Bertaud, 
Etude Economique Conseil, Quang Minh Consulting, 
Mekong Economics, and Urban Solutions. The Vietnam 
Urbanization Review was informed and enriched by 
extensive and valuable discussions with the government 
of Vietnam.

is a central element of Vietnam’s economic 
growth strategy. No country has achieved 
high-income  status  and  strong  economic 
growth without urbanizing, and nearly all 
countries become at least 50 percent urban-
ized before reaching middle-income status. 
Vietnam is on this path. Urbanization will be 
rapid for the next 10–15 years, and 50 per-
cent of the country’s population will be living 
in urban areas by 2025. 

How Vietnam is urbanizing
Vietnam has a complex system for classify-
ing cities, including two cities with Special 
status due to their significant and unique 
economic and political contributions to the 
country:  Ho  Chi  Minh  City  and  Hanoi. 
Then  cities  are  classified  from  Class  I  to 
Class V in descending order of size, with 
Class V marking the limit between rural and 
urban areas.1 Besides these two, Vietnam has 
at least two others with populations of more 
than 1 million (Can Tho and Hai Phong) 
and several medium cities (such as Da Nang, 
with a population of about 700,000). But 
most of Vietnam’s economic and population 
growth is driven by two independent, domi-
nant, core-periphery urban systems: Ho Chi 
Minh City and Hanoi (map 4.3). 

At this stage of Vietnam’s development, 
as gains from agglomeration economies are 
consolidated, the dominance of the major 
economic regions of the southeast (Ho Chi 
Minh City) and the Red River Delta (Hanoi), 
together with the emerging Mekong Delta 
economic region, are to be expected. But 
these regions appear to be developing in dif-
ferent ways, with some evidence that Hanoi 
is moving more rapidly into heavy and higher 
technology manufacturing, while Ho Chi 
Minh  City  and  the  southeast  region  still 
dominate economic and manufacturing out-
put (map 4.4).

Vietnam’s economic growth and competi-
tiveness will depend largely on these regions, 
and sustaining strategic investments in these 
areas is important for economic develop-
ment.  Notwithstanding  the  rise  of  urban 
economic centers, rural areas are still the

major source of livelihood for a large part of 
Vietnam’s population and 93 percent of its 
poor. For areas currently without strong eco-
nomic potential comparable with large cities, 
investing in people (education and health), 

infrastructure, and universal access to basic 
services will level the playing field and facili-
tate the fluidity of factor markets, enabling 
firms and households to choose the best loca-
tions for economic activity, thus maximizing 
Vietnam’s economic development.

Urban challenges
Valuing and pricing urban land
Land  markets  in  Vietnam  reflect  deeper 
issues  with  land  management  and  gover-
nance. Vietnamese cities have largely enabled 
a pluralistic supply of housing to meet the 
needs of different market segments—through 
small contractors producing town houses, 
incremental upgrading of housing stock, and 
infrastructure extension to increase the den-
sity of peri-urban areas. But land prices are 
by most indications high, partly due to Viet-
nam’s two-tiered land pricing system and a 
lack of good market information. In Hanoi 
and Ho Chi Minh City, land and housing 
prices produced by formal developers are 
perhaps affordable to only 5 percent of the 
population. 

Planning 
Planning and urban management in Vietnam 
still focus on static urban design principles—
not on the fluid functioning of land and hous-
ing markets. Strict adherence to static Master 
Plans, combined with a city classification sys-
tem that induces cities to annex rural areas 
and land lease for infrastructure financing, are 
leading to urban sprawl and new towns where 
there is little market demand (map 4.5).

Basic urban services
Vietnam has done a remarkable job attain-
ing nearly universal access to electricity (96 
percent). Access to other basic services such 
as water and sanitation remains at lower 
levels despite remarkable improvement (70 
percent of urban households had access to 
piped water by 2007). In contrast, waste 
water collection and treatment levels are still 
very low. And it appears that access to and 
quality of urban services diminishes with 
city size.

As Vietnam moves to higher income levels 
and as universal access is achieved in other 
services, the next goal will be to focus on 
the quality and sustainability of urban ser-
vices. Tariffs for urban water supply gener-
ally cover only operations and maintenance 
costs, and nonrevenue water (losses) is as 
high as 40 percent in major cities. A major 
challenge  for  local  governments  will  be 
financing infrastructure services. As service 
quality improves, tariffs will need to rise to 
cover investment costs as well (to the extent 
possible). Local governments have limited 
options  to  raise  own-source  revenues  for 
investment and rely increasingly on land sales 
(leases); for example, such sales made up 20 
percent of Ho Chi Minh City’s 2008 budget. 
Continuing strong investment in cities will 
depend on more sustainable financing.

Connections among neighborhoods within 
cities
Vietnam’s cities (including its largest) have 
relatively good mobility, due in part to the 
predominant use of motorcycles. But this is 
changing rapidly. As incomes rise, so will 

car ownership. As motorists shift to indi-
vidual cars for just a fraction of the current 
trips made by motorcycles, the current road 
networks in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City 
(to a slightly less extent) will be incompati-
ble with the demand for road space. A prior-
ity will be road networks and transit systems 
that are compatible with rising urban densi-
ties and land use trends (such as the emerg-
ing policy-centric development of the major 
cities) and that reflect consumer demand for 
location of housing and commercial facili-
ties. This will require integrating land use 
planning and development with transit and 
urban transport development. Minimizing 
the transition from motorbike to car while 
Vietnam’s major cities develop their transit 
networks will be a major challenge, yet it is 
a priority to ensure greater mobility in Viet-
nam’s cities.

Connections between metropolitan cores and 
peripheries
The connectivity of the urban system under-
scores the importance of investing in regional 
economic growth drivers. Ho Chi Minh City 
and the southeast together with the Mekong 
Delta Region account for 62 percent of Viet-
nam’s industrial activity, and Ho Chi Minh 
City and the southeast Region account for 
71 percent of the country’s seaport through-
put. From 1999–2009, the bulk of manufac-
turing employment and its highest growth 
were in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City and 
their neighboring suburban areas (within 70 
kilometers from the city center). Even at this 
early stage of urbanization, manufacturing 
activities are not confined to the adminis-
trative boundaries and, in many cases, there 
is strong manufacturing activity within a 
50-kilometer radius of the two major cities. 
Investing in logistics infrastructure will be 
critical to developing the country’s strongest 
economic regions. An intercity trucking sur-
vey conducted for the Urbanization Review 
indicates that transport costs are highest in 
the two main economic regions. Truckers 
identify poor road conditions and informal 
payments as the major bottlenecks. This sug-
gests that connections can be improved not

  111

only through strategic transport and logis-
tics improvements, but also through regula-
tory reforms to improve service quality in 
trucking and logistics services. Analysis sug-
gests that freight costs in the Ho Chi Minh 
City and Hanoi economic regions could be 
reduced 57 percent and 67 percent, respec-
tively, by reducing these bottlenecks.

Financing 
Provinces  and  their  subsidiary  units  are 
financing  themselves  through  a  range  of 
sources: equalization transfers from the cen-
tral government, taxes, land sales, short-term 
debt, local development investment funds, 
and sometimes cross-subsidies from profit-
able subsidiary entities of provincial public 
utility companies. The merits and risks of 
these approaches need to be further exam-
ined as alternatives are considered. For the 
poorer provinces, equalization has been a 
cornerstone in enabling access to basic ser-
vices and should be maintained.

Looking ahead
Planning
Monitoring land and housing markets will be 
important to help urban economies function 
efficiently and equitably. Moving from static 
to dynamic plans, better integrating planning 
functions, and using sharper tools to moni-
tor real changes in land and housing markets 
could improve the planning process consider-
ably and lead to a more efficient allocation of 
land uses. 

Connecting 
To ensure that transit systems are compatible 
with urban density and land use trends, it 

will be necessary to coordinate land use plan-
ning and development with transit and urban 
transport development. Minimizing the tran-
sition from motorbike to car while Vietnam’s 
major cities develop their transit networks 
will be a major challenge and priority to 
ensure greater mobility in Vietnam’s cities. 

Connections can be improved not only 
through  strategic  transport  and  logistics 
improvements, but also through regulatory 
reforms to improve service quality in truck-
ing and logistics services.

Financing 
Because  local  governments  have  limited 
options  to  raise  own-source  revenues  for 
investment,  sustaining  strong  investment 
in cities will depend on more sustainable 
sources of financing.

It also takes into account density, percentages 
of nonagricultural labor, and socioeconomic 
infrastructure available.
