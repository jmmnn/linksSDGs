FOREWORD

For more than half a century, most countries have experienced rapid urban growth and increased use of
motor vehicles. This has led to urban sprawl and even higher demand for motorized travel with a range of
environmental, social and economic consequences.

Urban transport is a signiﬁcant source of greenhouse gas emissions and a cause of ill-health due to air
and noise pollution. The trafﬁc congestion created by unsustainable transportation systems is responsible for
signiﬁcant economic and productivity costs for commuters and goods transporters.

These challenges are most pronounced in developing country cities. It is here that approximately 90 per
cent of global population growth will occur in the coming decades. These cities are already struggling to
meet increasing demand for investment in transportation. That is why my Five-year Action Agenda, launched
in January 2012, highlights urban transport – with a focus on pollution and congestion – as a core area for
advancing sustainable development.

This  year’s  edition  of  the  UN-Habitat  Global  Report  on  Human  Settlements provides  guidance  on
developing sustainable urban transportation systems. The report outlines trends and conditions and reviews
a range of responses to urban transport challenges worldwide. The report also analyses the relationship between
urban form and mobility, and calls for a future with more compact and efﬁcient cities. It highlights the role
of urban planning in developing sustainable cities where non-motorized travel and public transport are the
preferred modes of transport.

I commend this report to all involved in developing sustainable cities and urban transport systems. Success
in this area is essential for creating more equitable, healthy and productive urban living environments that
beneﬁt both people and the planet.

INTRODUCTION

Urban transport systems worldwide are faced by a multitude of challenges. In most cities, the economic dimensions
of such challenges tend to receive most attention. The trafﬁc gridlocks experienced on city roads and highways
have been the basis for the development of most urban transportation strategies and policies. The solution prescribed
in most of these has been to build more infrastructures for cars, with a limited number of cities improving public
transport systems in a sustainable manner.

However, the transportation sector is also responsible for a number of other challenges that do not necessarily
get solved by the construction of new infrastructure. It is, for example, responsible for a large proportion of the
greenhouse gas emissions that lead to climate change. Furthermore, road trafﬁc accidents are among the main
causes of premature deaths in most countries and cities. Likewise, the health effects of noise and air pollution
caused by motorized vehicles are a major cause for concern. In some cities, the physical separation of residential
areas from places of employment, markets, schools and health services force many urban residents to spend increasing
amounts of time, and as much as a third (and sometimes even more) of their income, on public transport.

While those among the urban populace that have access to a private car, or can afford to make regular use 
of public transport, see trafﬁc jams and congestion as a major concern; this is a marginal issue for people living
in ‘transport poverty’. Their only affordable option for urban transportation is their own feet. Persons with low
household incomes – but also others, including many women, and vulnerable groups such as the young, the elderly,
the  disabled,  and  ethnic  and  other  minorities  –  form  the  bulk  of  those  characterized  as  living  in  transport 
poverty.

Thus,  when  the  Secretary-General  of  the  United  Nations  launched  his  ‘5-year  action  agenda’  in  January 
2012, he identiﬁed sustainable transportation as one of the major building blocks of sustainable development. In
particular,  he  stressed  the  need  for  urgent  action  to  develop  more  sustainable  urban  ‘transport  systems 
that  can  address  rising  congestion  and  pollution’.  He  noted  that  action  was  required  by  a  range  of  actors, 
including ‘aviation, marine, ferry, rail, road and urban public transport providers, along with Governments and
investors’.

Planning and Design for Sustainable Urban Mobility: Global Report on Human Settlements 2013
seeks to highlight the transportation challenges experienced in cities all over the world, and identiﬁes examples
of good practice from speciﬁc cities of how to address such challenges. The report also provides recommendations
on how national, provincial and local governments and other stakeholders can develop more sustainable urban
futures through improved planning and design of urban transport systems.

The report argues that the development of sustainable urban transport systems requires a conceptual leap.
The purpose of ‘transportation’ and ‘mobility’ is to gain access to destinations, activities, services and goods. Thus,
access is the ultimate objective of all transportation (save a small portion of recreational mobility). The construction
of more roads for low-income cities and countries is paramount to create the conditions to design effective transport
solutions. However, urban planning and design for these cities and others in the medium and high income brackets
is crucial to reduce distances and increase accessibility to enhancing sustainable urban transport solutions. If city
residents can achieve access without having to travel at all (for instance through telecommuting), through more
efﬁcient travel (online shopping or car-sharing), or by travelling shorter distances, this will contribute to reducing
some of the challenges currently posed by urban transport. Thus, urban planning and design should focus on how
to bring people and places together, by creating cities that focus on accessibility, rather than simply increasing the
length of urban transport infrastructure or increasing the movement of people or goods.

The issue of urban form and functionality of the city is therefore a major focus of this report. Not only should
urban planning focus on increased population densities; cities should also encourage the development of mixed-
use areas. This implies a shift away from strict zoning regulations that have led to a physical separation of activities
and functions, and thus an increased need for travel. Instead, cities should be built around the concept of ‘streets’,

viii

Planning and Design for Sustainable Urban Mobility

which can serve as the focus for building liveable communities. Cities should therefore encourage mixed land-
use, both in terms of functions (i.e. residential, commercial, manufacturing, service functions and recreational)
and in terms of social composition (i.e. with neighbourhoods containing a mixture of different income and social 
groups).

Such developments also have the potential to make better use of existing transport infrastructure. Most of
today’s cities have been built as ‘zoned’ cities, which tends to make rather inefﬁcient use of their infrastructure;
as ‘everyone’ is travelling in the same direction at the same time. In such cities, each morning is characterized by
(often severe) trafﬁc jams on roads and congestion on public transport services leading from residential areas to
places of work. At the same time, however, the roads, buses and trains going in the opposite direction are empty.
In the afternoon the situation is the opposite. Thus, the infrastructure in such cities is operating at half capacity
only, despite congestion. In contrast, in cities characterized by ‘mixed land-use’ (such as Stockholm, Sweden),
trafﬁc ﬂows are multidirectional – thus making more efﬁcient use of the infrastructure – as residential areas and
places of work are more evenly distributed across the urban landscape.

Furthermore, the report argues with strong empirical information that increased sustainability of urban passenger
transport systems can be achieved through modal shifts – by increasing the modal share of public transport and
non-motorized transport modes (walking and bicycling), and by reducing private motorized transport. Again, an
enhanced focus on urban planning and design is required, to ensure that cities are built to encourage environmentally
sustainable transportation modes. While encouraging a shift to non-motorized transport modes, however, the report
acknowledges that such modes are best suited for local travel and that motorized transport (in particular public
transport) has an important role while travelling longer distances. However, in many (if not most) countries there
is a considerable stigma against public transport. The private car is often seen as the most desirable travel option.
There is thus a need to enhance the acceptability of public transport systems. More needs to be done to increase
reliability and efﬁciency of public transport services and to make these services more secure and safe.

The report also notes that most trips involve a combination of several modes of transport. Thus, modal integration
is stressed as a major component of any urban mobility strategy. For example, the construction of a high-capacity
public transport system needs to be integrated with other forms of public transport, as well as with other modes.
Such integration with various ‘feeder services’ is crucial to ensure that metros, light rail and bus rapid transit (BRT)
systems can fully utilize their potential as a ‘high-capacity’ public transport modes. It is therefore essential that
planners take into account how users (or goods) travel the ‘last (or ﬁrst) mile’ of any trip. By way of an example,
it is not much use to live ‘within walking distance’ of a metro (or BRT) station, if this implies crossing a busy eight-
lane highway without a pedestrian crossing, or if one is unable to walk to the station (due to disability, or lack of
personal security). Likewise, it is unlikely that urban residents will make use of metros (and BRTs), if the nearest
station is located beyond walking distance, and there is no public transport ‘feeder’ services providing access to
these stations or no secure parking options for private vehicles near the stations.

Yet, it is important to note that considerable investments are still required in urban transportation infrastructure
in most cities, and particularly in developing countries. City authorities should ensure that such investments are
made where they are most needed. They should also make sure that they are commensurate with their ﬁnancial,
institutional and technical capacities. In many cities of developing countries, large proportions of the population
cannot afford to pay the fare required to use public transport, or to buy a bicycle. Others may ﬁnd these modes
of transport affordable, but choose not to use them as they ﬁnd the safety and security of public transport to be
inadequate (due to sexual harassment or other forms of criminal behaviour), and/or the roads to be unsafe for
bicycle use or walking (due to lack of appropriate infrastructure). Investment in infrastructure for non-motorized
transport or affordable (and acceptable) public transport systems is a more equitable (and sustainable) use of scarce
funds.

However, many cities and metropolitan areas, all around the world, experience considerable institutional,
regulatory and governance problems when trying to address urban mobility challenges. In many cases national,
regional and local institutions may be missing or their responsibilities may be overlapping, and even in conﬂict
with each other. To address such concerns, the report notes that it is essential that all stakeholders in urban
transport  –  including  all  levels  of  government,  transport  providers  and  operators,  the  private  sector,  and  civil 
society  (including  transport  users)  –  are  engaged  in  the  governance  and  development  of  urban  mobility 
systems.

To ensure effective integration of transportation and urban development policies, it is essential that urban
transportation and land-use policies are fully integrated. Such integration is required at all geographic scales. At
the micro level, much is to be gained from advancing the model of ‘complete streets’; an acknowledgement that
streets serve numerous purposes, not just moving cars and trucks. At the macro level, there is considerable scope
for  cross-subsidies  between  different  parts  of  the  urban  mobility  system,  including  through  value-capture
mechanisms which ensure that increased land and property values (generated by the development of high-capacity
public transport systems) beneﬁts the city at large, and the wider metropolitan region, rather than private sector
actors alone.

Planning and Design for Sustainable Urban Mobility: Global Report on Human Settlements 2013 is
released at a time when the challenges of urban transportation demands are greater than ever. This is particularly

Introduction

the case in developing countries where populations (and the number of motorized vehicles) are growing at rates
where urban infrastructure investments are unable to keep pace. I believe this report will serve as a starting point
to guide local authorities and other stakeholders to address the challenges faced by urban transportation systems
all over the world. The report provides some thought-provoking insights on how to build the cities of the future
in such a manner that the ultimate goal of urban transport – namely enhanced access to destinations, activities,
services and goods – takes precedence over ever-increasing calls for increased urban mobility.

THE URBAN MOBILITY 
CHALLENGE

Hyper-mobility – the notion that more travel at faster
speeds covering longer distances generates greater
economic prosperity – seems to be a distinguishing
feature  of  urban  areas,  where  more  than  half  of 
the  world’s  population  currently  reside.  By  2005,
approximately 7.5 billion trips were made each day
in cities worldwide.1 In 2050, there may be three to
four times as many passen ger-kilometres travelled as
in the year 2000, infra struc ture and energy prices
permitting.2 Freight movement could also rise more
than  threefold  during  the  same  period.3 Mobility
ﬂows have become a key dynamic of urbanization,
with the associated infra struc ture invariably consti -
tut ing the backbone of urban form. Yet, despite the
increasing level of urban mobility worldwide, access
to  places,  activities  and  services  has  become  in -
creasingly difﬁcult. Not only is it less convenient –
in terms of time, cost and comfort – to access loca -
tions in cities, but the very process of moving around
in cities generates a number of negative externalities.
Accordingly, many of the world’s cities face an un -
prece dented accessibility crisis, and are charac terized
by unsus tain able mobility systems.

This report examines the state of urban mobility
in different parts of the world. It explores the linkages
between urban form and mobility systems, with a view
to determining the essential conditions for promoting
the sus tain able movement of people and goods in
urban settings. This introductory chapter reviews key
issues and concerns of urban mobility and provides
a framework for the content of the rest of the report.
It outlines devel op ment trends impacting on urban
mobility and then discusses urban mobility issues of
the twenty-ﬁrst century, including the challenges of
fostering sus tain able mobility.

Current urbanization patterns are causing un -
precedented challenges to urban mobility systems,
particularly  in  devel op ing  countries.  While  these
areas accounted for less than 40 per cent of the global
population growth in the early 1970s, this share has
now increased to 86 per cent, and is projected to
increase to more than 100 per cent within the next

15  years,  as  the  world’s  rural  population  starts  to
contract. What is perhaps even more striking is the
regional patterns of urban population growth. Figure
1.1 shows how an increasing share of this growth is
projected  to  occur  in  Africa  (19  per  cent  of  total
annual  growth  today,  compared  to  43  per  cent  in
2045),  while  the  combined  annual  urban  popula-
tion  increase  in  developed  countries,  China,  Latin
America and the Caribbean is projected to decrease
from 46 per cent of the total today to 11 per cent
in 2045. Thus, it is the world’s poorest regions that
will  experi ence  the  greatest  urban  population
increase.  These  are  the  regions  that  will  face  the
greatest challenges in terms of coping with increasing
demands  for  improved  trans port  infra struc ture.  In
fact, projections indicate that Africa will account for
less than 5 per cent of the global investments in trans -
port infra struc ture during the next few decades (see
Table 8.2).

A major point of departure for this report is that
sus tain able mobility  extends  beyond  technicalities 
of  increasing  speed  and  improving  the  effective-
ness and efﬁciency of trans port systems, to include
demand-oriented measures (e.g. promoting walking
and cycling, and reducing the need to travel), with
the latter representing a pivotal factor in achieving
relevant  progress.  It  suggests  that  the  prevailing
challenges of urban mobility are consequences of the
preoccupation with the means of mobility rather than
its end – which is the realization of accessibility.
This  ﬁrst  chapter  of  the  report  starts  with  a
discussion of the need to focus on access as the basis
for urban mobility planning. It urges urban planners
and decision-makers to move away from a ‘trans port
bias’ in urban mobility planning, towards a focus on
the human right to equitable access to opportunities.
This is followed by a brief analysis of global condi-
tions and trends with respect to the urban movement
of  people  and  goods.  The  last  part  of  the  chapter
provides  a  brief  discussion  of  the  social,  environ -
mental, economic and institutional dimensions of sus -
tain ability in urban mobility systems.

ACCESSIBILITY IS AT 
THE CORE OF URBAN
MOBILITY
In directing attention beyond trans port and mobility,
and  giving  prominence  to  the  aspect  of  accessi-
bility, this report calls for a paradigm shift in trans -
port policy. This alternative approach emphasizes the
need to reduce the global preoccupation on mobility
enhancement  and  infra struc ture  expansion.  ‘This
kind of transportation planning has been implicated
in problems of environmental degradation and social
isolation.’ However, ‘most fundamentally, a focus on
mobility as a transportation-policy goal neglects the
consensus view that the vast majority of trips are not
taken for the sake of movement per se, but in order
to  reach  destinations,  or  more  broadly,  to  meet
needs.’4

While  the  speed  and  efﬁciency  of  travel  are
important,  more  critical  however,  is  the  ease  of
reaching those destinations in terms of proximity,
convenience as well as positive externalities. Trans -
port and mobility as derived demands are treated as
means for enabling people to access other people and
places.  Reducing  the  need  for  such  demands  and
minimizing  travel  time  also  entails  optimizing  the
value of being at the destination. ‘Mobility is thus
properly  viewed  as  a  means  to  the  greater  end  of
accessibility.’ Nonetheless, it is not the only means
to this end: ‘accessibility can be enhanced through
proximity’, as well as ‘electronic connectivity’.5 As a
result,  enhancing  accessibility  places  human  and
spatial dimensions at the core of sustainable mobility.
This focus on accessibility emphasizes the need

for a holistic and integrated approach to sus tain able
urban mobility. It establishes a link between urban
form (in terms of shape, structure, function as well
as demographics) and urban transportation systems.
Particular  attention  is  given  to  the  urban  form’s
potential to support the increased proximity of places
and functions, thus minimizing the need for extended
movement. Land-use planning ensures the proximity
and compactness of locations, and divers iﬁes func -
tions, so as to cater to a variety of needs.

The accessibility focus for sus tain able mobility
also entails paying due consideration to the built form
of  the  city,  particularly  the  optimization  of  urban
density and the fostering of a sense of place. The
combination of high-density settlements, strong sense
of place and mixed-used functions not only minimize
the need for extended movement, but also enhance
economies  of  agglomeration  and  encourage  non-
motorized mobility. Further more, appropriate design
and  layout  of  streets  and  neigh bour hoods,  proper
allowance  for  building  conﬁguration  and  density,
and  streamlined  arrangement  of  arterial  streets 
and roads, should also be taken into account. The
backbone  of  accessibility-based  urban  mobility  is
public  transport,  particularly  high-capacity  public
trans port systems that are well integrated in a multi-
nodal arrangement.

The  bottom  line  for  accessibility  is  not  the
hardware; rather it is the quality and efﬁciency of
reaching destinations whose distances are reduced.
Equally important is the affordability and inclusive -
ness  in  using  the  provided  facilities.  Sus tain able
mobility is thus determined by the degree to which
the city as a whole is accessible to all its residents,
including  low-income  earners,  the  elderly,  the

young, the disabled, as well as women with children.
Further more,  trans port  interventions  should  be 
expli citly targeted to prevent negative outcomes. By
permitting  high  levels  of  innovative  services  and
giving priority to public and non-motorized transport,
the need for private cars is reduced. Strategies to
change public attitudes and encourage sus tain able
forms of mobility thus have a key role to play.

This alternative approach also brings to the fore
the human rights dimension of sus tain able mobility:
‘the right to mobility is universal to all human beings,
and is essential for the effective practical realisation
of most other basic human rights’.6 Beyond the policy
implications of such a profound acknowledgement,
the observation also has an important bearing on this
report. Recognizing mobility as an entitlement – i.e.
to access destinations, functions or services – implies
a focus on people, and underscores the need to pay
attention to the obstacles that prevent them from
reaching  destinations.  Consequently,  mobility  is 
not only a matter of devel op ing trans port infrastruc-
ture  and  services,  but  also  of  overcoming  the 
social, economic, political and physical constraints 
to movement. These constraints are inﬂuenced by
factors  such  as:  class,  gender  relations,  poverty,
physical  disabilities,  affordability,  etc.  Mobility  is
thus about granting access to opportunities and em -
powering people to fully exercise their human rights.
Thus,  associating  sus tain able mobility  with
human  rights  takes  it  beyond  the  realm  of  func -
tionality and economic justiﬁcation. Instead it places
the issue at the same level as other essential elements
required  for  the  full  realization  of  human  rights.
Indeed,  there  is  a  general  consensus  that  all  the
political, social, cultural and economic rights cannot
be realized without the component of accessibility
(and thus equitable mobility). The underlying premise
– within a human rights perspective – is that mobility
is not simply about reaching destinations; in the ﬁnal
analysis, it is about accessing oppor tunities. In this
regard – and acknowledging that access is a tacit right
that all human beings are en titled to – there is a need
to ensure that any con straints to enjoying this funda -
mental entitlement are removed.

This  report  illustrates  the  contextual  circum -
stances  of  urban  mobility  challenges,  which  have
restricted access to cities by various social groups.
Working  towards  sus tain able mobility,  renewed
efforts  within  and  between  govern ments,  are
essential  in  ensuring  that  solutions  are  inclusive,
participatory,  and  that  all  budgetary  and  resource
implications meet the needs of all citizens.

THE TRANS PORT BIAS 
OF MOBILITY
In many cities of the world, the equation of ‘mobil-
ity’  with  ‘transportation’  has  fostered  a  tendency

towards  increasing  motorization,  and  a  propensity 
to  expand  the  network  of  urban  roads.  Highway
structures, including viaducts and ﬂyovers, tunnels
and foot-bridges have become standard features of
the modern city and urban landscape. Encouraging
this whole process is the excessive sectorization of
transportation planning and management. Apart from
causing a spiral of negative externalities, this approach
further  distorts  the  urban  form  and  severely
undermines the environ mental, social and economic
sus tain ability of cities. A major missing link which
this report underscores is that sus tain able mobility
entails – and indeed requires – a closer connection
between trans port and land-use planning.

Globally, the trans port bias of urban mobility is
demonstrated by the dominance of motorization, and
particularly private motor vehicles as the preferred
means of mobility. In 2010, there were more than
1 billion motor vehicles worldwide (excluding two-
wheelers).7 Based on data from 2005, nearly half of
all  urban  trips  were  made  by  private  motorized
modes, a ﬁgure that continues to climb.8 By 2010,
developed countries had, on average, ten times as
many motor vehicles (excluding two-wheelers) per
capita as devel op ing ones.9

Meteoric  increases  in  the  number  of  motor
vehicles  in  devel op ing  countries  mean  that  a
redistribution of the ‘global travel pie’ is unfolding.
By 2035, the number of light-duty motor vehicles –
cars, sports utility vehicles (SUVs), light trucks and
mini-vans – is projected to reach nearly 1.6 billion
(Figure 1.2). The majority of these will be found in
devel op ing  countries,  especially  China,  India  and
other Asian countries. China alone is projected to
have approximately 350 million private cars by 2035,
nearly ten times as many as they had in 2008.10 In
some rapidly emerging economies such as India, the
number of cars, trucks, and motorized two-wheelers
on city streets is growing at a rate of more than 20
per cent annually.11 Mexico City’s car population is
increasing faster than its human population – two
new cars enter into circulation every time a child is
born.12 In  India,  private  vehicle  growth  exceeds
population gains by a factor of three.13

The  extent  of  global  motorization  is  a  major
cause  for  the  increasing  trends  in  energy  use  and
carbon emissions worldwide. This has fuelled low-
density  devel op ment  and  sprawling  urban  forms,
which have gradually increased the dependence on
motorized  transport.  Further more,  govern ment
policies in the United States (US) have contributed
towards shaping car-dependent settlement patterns.
Following  the  Second  World  War,  the  US  govern-
ment  invested  heavily  in  high-capacity  highways 
and freeways and subsidized home mortgages, while
most  of  its  European  counterparts  channelled 
funds into devel op ment of urban rail systems, and
social and market-rate housing near public trans port
stops.14

However, global motorization explains only part
of  the  increasing  energy  use  and  greenhouse  gas
emissions  worldwide.  Other  contributing  factors
relate  to  economic  growth  and  rising  incomes,
especially  in  devel op ing  countries.  From  2002  to
2007, China’s per capita incomes almost doubled,
and car ownership nearly tripled.15 Car dependency
is also served by a cultural and commercial system,
which promotes the car as a symbol of status and
personal  freedom.  Therefore,  many  devel op ing
countries  perceive  motorization  as  a  condition  for
devel op ment. Conversely, evidence from an analysis
of  the  relationship  between  car  use  and  gross
domestic product (GDP) per capita levels between
1970 and 2008 in eight developed countries shows
that travel distances by cars may have peaked and
that further increases in GDP per capita are unlikely
to lead to increased travel distances.16 Another recent
study found that the annual increase in car use per
capita in developed countries fell from 4.2 per cent
in the 1960s, to 2.3 per cent in the 1990s, to 0.5
per  cent  from  2000  to  2010.17 Saturation  occurs
partly  because  the  amount  of  additional  wealth 
that  people  choose  to  spend  on  travel  is  reduced
when  incomes  reach  a  certain  point.18 In  the  US, 
for  instance,  households  earning  US$50,000  per
year averaged more kilometres of vehicle travel in
2009 than households with twice as much annual
income.19 Moreover,  factors  such  as  shrinking 
city sizes and lifestyle changes are contributing to
levelling off of car ownership and usage in developed
coun tries. Further more, increasingly ageing popula -
tions further contribute to the stabilization of motor -
ization rates.20

In  many  transitional  countries,  the  shift  to
capitalist  economies  has  been  accompanied  by  an
explosive growth in the number of freight vehicles,
particularly trucks. From 1993 to 2009, truck trafﬁc
grew  by  165  per  cent  in  Poland,  213  per  cent  in
Croatia, and 247 per cent in the Czech Republic.21
Many  trucks  are  old  and  are  kept  running  for 
longer than the manufacturer’s estimated lifetime,

aggra vating  energy  requirements,  local  environ-
mental  problems  and  carbon  emissions.  In  Asia’s
rapidly  industrializing  cities,  globalization  and
consumerism  have  given  rise  to  a  wide  variety  of
freight-carrying modes – trucks, pickup vans, trailers,
ropeways  and  railways  that  coexist  with  non-
motorized modes such as cycle rickshaws, animal-
powered carts and head-loading. For every truck in
Delhi,  India,  there  are  about  ﬁve  feeder  informal
motorized goods vehicles, ﬁve non-motorized vehicles
and ﬁve to ten head-loaders.22

Another feature of the trans port bias has been
heavy  investments  in  infra struc ture.  In  China,  for
example, the total length of urban roads more than
doubled  in  the  13-year  period  between  1990  and
2003.23 During  the  same  period,  the  total  area
allocated to roads more than tripled.24 Similarly, in
Nairobi, Kenya, a total of 143 kilometres of urban
roads was either newly constructed or rehabilitated
for  a  total  cost  of  US$537.8  million  between 
2008 and 2012.25 This is a substantial amount for a 
young African economy, and was invested mainly to
increase trafﬁc ﬂows and to enable faster mobility.
In European countries, road infra struc ture accounted
for  more  than  two-thirds  of  infra struc ture  invest -
ments  in  the  trans port  sector  between  1995  and
2010 (Figure 1.3).

The global expansion of mobility encompasses
great  innovations  that  have  linked  transportation
with intelligent communication systems, transforming
the way in which people organize their travel and
communication considerably. The interplay of these
systems has redeﬁned the core of social interaction
and  urban  life.26 Accordingly,  the  evolving  trans-
port system of the last century is ﬁrmly rooted in a
number  of  key  components  including  motorized
modes,  oil  industry,  consumerist  lifestyles,  global
procurement of oil, spatial and infra struc ture plan -
ning,  urban  and  street  design  and  societal  values 
that embrace mobility as part of what constitutes high
quality of life standards.27

SOME OF THE FORCES
PROMOTING THE 
TRANS PORT BIAS
The rapid motorization of many of the world’s cities
is  further  compounded  by  expanding  globaliza-
tion, rising trade ﬂows and incomes, leading to an
enhanced  demand  for  personal  mobility.  In  many
parts  of  the  world,  and  particularly  in  devel op ing
countries, the private car has become a status sym-
bol, depicting afﬂuence and success in life. A prime
example  is  the  largely  unregulated  large-scale  im -
portation  of  used  vehicles  to  devel op ing  coun-
tries.  Evidence  suggests  that  over  80  per  cent  of 
the vehicle stock in Peru was originally imported as
used vehicles from the US or Japan.28 Similarly, in
many African countries, import-liberalization policies
intro duced  during  the  1990s  made  it  easier  and
cheaper for households to buy second-hand vehicles
imported from overseas.

A number of inﬂuential converging factors – such
as  economic  policies  that  maintain  fuel  subsidies 
and  planning  practices  that  incentivize  suburban
residential  devel op ments,  large  malls  and  retail
centres with extensive parking – all play a role in
increasing motorization. The suburban devel op ment
that supported the car culture allowed people to live
in  low-density  residential  areas  that,  although
requiring a longer commute, were cheaper in terms
of land prices. Some examples include the rise of 
new ‘urban villages’ such as Mahindra World City in
Chennai (India), Gurgaon satellite town near Delhi
(India) and Tlajomulco in the urban agglomeration
of Guadalajara (Mexico). Similarly, in Metro Manila,
the  Philippines,  new  settlements  described  as
‘exurbia’ have emerged during the last two decades,
including Bulacan, Pampanga, Rizal, Quezon, Cavite,

Laguna and Batangas, all of which have been con -
verted  into  gated  communities  and  sustained  by
dependence on car-based transportation.29 It should
also be mentioned that between 1970 and 1990, Los
Angeles, US, sprawled an additional 1020 square kilo -
metres, during which time the population increased
by 3.1 million residents.30

Such  planning  choices  ensured  that  the  car
became  an  essential  part  of  most  people’s  trans -
portation needs. In many instances, govern ments at
all  levels  have  also  accelerated  sprawl  by  building
more roads to the urban fringe. For example, despite
having only 10 per cent more freeway kilometres,
Chicago has more than twice as many residents as
Houston. The increasing trend to build more roads
in Houston has encouraged devel op ment to shift to
newer  areas,  with  minimal  bus  service.  This  has
rein forced  the  vicious  circle  of  car  dependency,
where the new roads develop their own congestion
problems. In 1999 alone, Houstonians lost 36 hours
per person as a result of trafﬁc congestion, more than
commuters  in  all  but  three  other  American  cities 
(Los Angeles, San Francisco and Dallas).31

The  fragmentation  and  sectoralization  of  the
management  of  urban  devel op ment  in  many  parts 
of  the  world  is  also  reinforcing  the  dominance  of 
the  traditional  ‘trans port  bias’  in  urban  mobility
systems.  Much  has  been  documented  about  the
proliferation of institutions in both developed and
devel op ing  countries.32 The  poor  linkage  between
land-use and trans port planning has encouraged the
tendency towards increased trans port investments.
The latter delivers immediate visible infrastructural
outputs  –  with  direct  outcomes  and  impacts  –
beneﬁting  a  range  of  interests  and  having  higher
political pay-off, at least in the short run.

Beyond  the  strategic  and  economic  dynamics
within  countries,  global  forces  in  much  of  the

Planning and Design for Sustainable Urban Mobility

second  half  of  the  twentieth  century  fostered  a
spatial pattern that provided a justiﬁcation for the
traditional trans port bias of urban mobility systems.
The  ‘Fordist’  pattern  of  accumulation  –  which
prevailed after the Second World War – promoted a
distinct  spatial  urban  landscape  and  system  of
governance,  which  was  hierarchical  and  highly
fragmented.  The  core–periphery  delineation  was
replicated  across  all  levels,  with  a  set  of  cities
acquiring the status of global centres for driving the
system of globalization. At the city level, the centrality
of manufacturing and trading was facilitated through
spatial segregation and by maximizing the economies
of  urbanization.33 Towards  the  last  quarter  of  the
twentieth century, greenﬁeld land, suburban housing
and  urban  infrastructural  investments  became  the
avenues  for  illicit  wealth  generation  that  caused 
the global ﬁnan cial crisis. In many parts of Europe,
the US and Latin America there are swaths of real
estate spread out in the suburban areas and exurban
regions that were part of such schemes. The highways
and  boulevards  leading  to  these  sites  further
enhanced the motorization trend.34

It has been estimated that between 1950 and
2005, raw material extraction (biomass, fossil-energy
carriers, ores and industrial minerals, construction
minerals)  increased  from  10  to  60  billion  metric
tonnes, excluding water and land resources.35 The
most signiﬁcant increase came from the extraction
of construction materials and ores/industrial minerals.
In 1900, biomass accounted for almost 75 per cent
of total material use; however its share had dropped
to only one-third by 2005, indicating that the global
economy has gradually reduced its dependence on
renewable materials (i.e. biomass) and increased its
dependence  on  ﬁnite  mineral  resources,  which
cannot  be  replaced.36 While  demand  was  increas-
ing, for a long time prices were also declining, thus
encouraging  increased  dependence  on  the  ﬁnite
resources, including, in this case, motorization as the
dominant mode of mobility.

TRENDS AND CONDITIONS
IN TRANSPORT-ORIENTED
MOBILITY SYSTEMS
This section provides an overview of global trends
and conditions, with trans port as the main focus of
improving mobility and enabling access. It examines
formal and informal modes of transport, including
walking and cycling. Further more, the implications
of  rapid  motorization  on  economic  performance 
and social equity in cities are discussed. An overview
of the alternative to transport-oriented mobility will
be provided in chapters 5 to 8; speciﬁcally, the com -
ponents of an accessibility-based sus tain able mobility.

Varying but declining dominance of
public transport
In  2005,  16  per  cent  of  all  trips  in  urban  areas
worldwide were by some form of public trans port (i.e.
formal, institutionally recognized services, such as
buses and rail-based public transport) (Figure 1.4).
The role of public trans port in individual cities varies
widely, accounting for 45 per cent of urban trips in
some cities of Eastern Europe and Asia, 10 to 20 per
cent in much of Western Europe and Latin America,
and less than 5 per cent in North America and Sub-
Saharan  Africa.37 In  2001,  more  than  half  of  all
mechanized  trips  (i.e.  excluding  walking)  in  Hong
Kong and Eastern European cities (such as Bucharest,
Romania; Moscow, Russia; and Warsaw, Poland) were
by public transport, compared to an average of about
25 per cent for Western European cities, and less
than 10 per cent in the high-income, car-oriented
cities of Dubai (United Arab Emirates), Melbourne
(Australia) and Chicago (US). However even within
Western Europe, the role of public trans port varies
sharply, capturing more than a third of all mechanized
trips in rail-served cities such as Berlin (Germany),
Helsinki  (Finland),  Lisbon  (Portugal)  and  Vienna
(Austria) and fewer than 10 per cent of mechanized
trips in European cities such as Ghent (Belgium), Lille
(France) and Glasgow (UK).38

In  cities  of  devel op ing  countries,  the  role  of
public trans port varies markedly, particularly among
African cities. Only a handful of Sub-Saharan Africa
cities (such as Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; Abidjan, Côte
d’Ivoire;  and  Ouagadougou,  Burkina  Faso)  have
reasonably  well-developed,  institutionalized  public
bus services that account for 25 to 35 per cent of
all motorized trips.39 Most other parts of Sub-Saharan
Africa  are  characterized  by  private  paratransit  and
informal operators, with local buses serving only a
small fraction of trips, if any. In fact, in most of Sub-
Saharan  Africa,  and  poorer  parts  of  South  and
Southeast Asia, govern ment-sponsored public trans -
port services are either inadequate or non-existent.40
However,  in  North  Africa,  many  cities  have  well-

developed public trans port systems, including formal
buses and informal shared taxis, and rail-based modes.
In  Egypt  for  example,  Cairo’s  metro  has  been
operational and expanding since 1987. Similarly, a
modern light rail system in Tunis, Tunisia, has been
successfully  operating  since  the  early  1990s.  In
Cairo, public trans port (formal and informal) accounts
for more than 75 per cent of daily motorized trips.41
In South-Eastern Asia, conventional 50-passen -
ger buses are the workhorse of the public trans port
networks  of  most  cities.  In  Bangkok,  Thailand, 
50 per cent of passen ger trips are by bus, rising to
75  per  cent  during  peak  hours.42 In  Eastern  Asia,
buses serve slightly larger shares of mechanized trips 
than metros in Taipei, China (14.4 versus 12.9 per
cent) and Shanghai, China (12.9 per cent versus 5.7
per  cent);  whereas  metros  are  more  dominant  in
Hong  Kong,  China  (35.5  per  cent  of  mechanized
trips);  Seoul,  Republic  of  Korea  (34.8  per  cent); 
and greater Tokyo, Japan (57 per cent).43 Throughout
Latin America, buses dominate, even in rail-served
cities  such  as  São  Paulo  (Brazil),  Santiago  (Chile) 
and Buenos Aires (Argentina). As noted in Chapter
3, the world’s most extensive bus rapid transit (BRT)
networks  are  currently  found  in  Latin  America, 
where a total of 18 cities currently have some form
of BRT system.44

Despite growing concerns over energy supplies,
climate  change  and  access  for  the  poor,  public
transport’s modal share of trips is expected to decline
over the next decade in all world regions. If recent
trends continue, the number of trips made by public
trans port will  increase  by  around  30  per  cent
between 2005 and 2025, an estimate that is far less
than  the  80  per  cent  growth  in  trips  by  private
motorized vehicles over the same period.45 In recent
years, public transport’s downward spiral has been
most pronounced in Eastern Europe. The transition
to capitalist economies has brought with it substantial
public trans port services cuts and disinvestments –
the same kind of vicious cycle that has marginalized
public trans port in more advanced economies.

The declining market share of trips served by
public trans port is cause for concern since they are
the  most  efﬁcient  forms  of  motorized  mobility,
particularly  for  low-income  earners.  The  low  and
decreasing role of public trans port renders it even
more  complicated  to  foster  an  effective  linkage
between land-use and trans port planning. More effort
is devoted to control and regulation of the private
and informal sector operators whose main motivation
is increasing proﬁt.

Informality
Worldwide,  the  informal  trans port sector  provides
much-needed  (and  much-valued)  mobility,  particu-
larly for the poor. The lack of affordable and accessible
public trans port systems in devel op ing countries has

led to the proliferation of informal operators, such
as  private  microbus  and  mini bus  services.  These
modes help ﬁll service gaps but can also worsen trafﬁc
congestion and air quality. In some settings, informal
carriers  are  the  only  forms  of  public  trans port
available. In India, for example, only about 100 of
the more than 5000 cities and towns have formal
public trans port systems. Accordingly, conventional
public  trans port has  been  replaced  by  more  ubi -
quitous  but  less  affordable  paratransit  such  as
motorcycle taxis, rickshaws, jeepneys and jitneys.46
Since cities in poorer countries seldom have the
institutional and ﬁnan cial capacity to increase and
sustain public trans port systems – and private ﬁrms
typically  lack  the  capital  and  incentive  to  provide
comprehensive trans port systems – small, private and
informal  systems  prevail.  Like  many  market-based
solutions, they provide a service that must be ﬁlled,
but not without compromises to the environ ment and
lack of service to those who are marginalized or live
in  less  proﬁt-rich  locations.47 These  are  called
informal  public  trans port or  paratransit,  because
they serve the public and are essentially providing a
public good.

Non-motorized transport
Non-motorized transportation is often the dominant
mode  of  urban  mobility  when  public  trans port
services are poor and incomes are low. In 2005, about
37 per cent of urban trips worldwide were made by
foot or bicycle, which are the two major modes of
urban non-motorized trans port (Figure 1.4). For very
short trips, walking is the main mode of trans port in
both developed and devel op ing countries. The modal
share  of  walking  can  be  very  high.  In  African 
cities,  walking  accounts  for  30–35  per  cent  of  all
trips. In Dakar (Senegal) and Douala (Cameroon) the
share is much higher, at over 60 per cent.48 Evidence
shows  that  non-motorized  trans port is  an  import-
ant  com ponent  in  poorer  and  smaller  cities,  cap-
turing as much as 90 per cent of all person-trips.49
Further more,  in  densely  packed  urban  centres, 
non-motorized  trans port provides  access  to  places
that motorized modes cannot reach, and is often the
fastest  means  of  getting  around.  In  South  Asia’s
densest, most congested cities, more than half of all
passen ger  and  goods  trips  are  by  foot,  bicycles  or
rickshaw.50

Walking  is  often  the only  form  of  trans port 
for  the  very  poor,  when  weather  and  topography
permit.  Many  people  in  devel op ing  countries  are
‘captive walkers’, meaning that they walk because
they cannot afford an alternative. For them, having
a well-connected and safe pedestrian environ ment
is critical to meeting their daily needs.51 As the least
costly  form  of  mobility,  walking  allows  the  very 
poor  to  reduce  their  daily  expenses,  and  thus  has
signiﬁcant poverty impacts. The most visible indicator

Planning and Design for Sustainable Urban Mobility

Trafﬁc congestion
is an undesirable
by-product of
widespread
mobility in cities
worldwide, and a
major factor in
restricting access
in cities

Trafﬁc congestion
is a major
indication of the
disjuncture
between land-use
planning and
transport systems 

of  poverty  in  many  cities,  particularly  in  develop-
ing countries, is the presence of slums and squatter
communities.  Spatially,  the  ﬁeld  of  movement  in
these slums is very restricted, with such limitations
constraining income and employment opportunities
for the urban poor. As a result, the affected popu -
lation is forced to restrict their travel to essential trips
related to work, education and shopping.

In pursuit of trans port policies reﬂecting sus tain -
able mobility, the promotion of walking and cycling
is  very  important.  The  bicycle  is  by  far  the  most
energy-effective means of passen ger trans port and
offers  a  relatively  inexpensive  means  of  improv-
ing  the  accessibility  of  poor  people.  In  developed
countries, bicycles are commonly used as a feeder
mode  to  public  trans port services.  A  well-known
example is the Netherlands, where bicycles are used
for more than 40 per cent of trips in some cities.52
Historically,  bicycles  are  particularly  important  in
Chinese  cities.53 Non-motorized  trans port shares 
are highest in smaller Chinese cities, in the ranges
of 70 to 80 per cent.54

Bicycles serve relatively small shares of person
trips in many major African cities, however, cycling
is  popular  in  smaller  and  secondary  cities.55 Dan -
gerous  and  crowded  roads,  and  the  absence  of
protected lanes, have discouraged cycling in many
African cities.56 Still, bicycles can be an important
source  of  economic  livelihoods,  as  evidenced  in
Kisumu, Kenya, where bicycle-taxis (bodaboda) ferry
commuters across town at half the price of a matatu
ride or in Bukoba, Tanzania, where some residents
carry passen gers or haul goods on their esekidos to
supplement their wages.57

In  Bangladesh,  India,  Pakistan  and  Sri  Lanka,
bicycles serve as ‘mass transport’ in the form of cycle
rickshaws, serving mostly women and children. In
Dhaka, Bangladesh, around 40 per cent of school trips
are by rickshaw.58 Also, rickshaw pulling often offers
an entry point into the labour market for unskilled
rural migrants to the cities of South Asia. In Dhaka,
20 per cent of the population, or 2.5 million people,
rely on rickshaw pulling for their livelihood, directly
or indirectly.59 This notwithstanding, rickshaws are
banned  from  Dhaka’s  main  roads  for  slowing
motorized trafﬁc, and the view of some public ofﬁcials
is that they detract from the city’s image as a modern
metropolis.

Traffic congestion
Trafﬁc  congestion  is  an  undesirable  by-product  of
widespread mobility in cities worldwide, and a major
factor in restricting access in cities. A recent global
study  of  20  major  cities  revealed  that  trafﬁc  con -
gestion  levels  markedly  worsened  between  2007
and 2010.60 Motorists in Moscow, Russia, reported
an  average  daily  delay  of  two  and  a  half  hours.61
With a 24 per cent annual growth rate in the number

of  registered  motor  vehicles,  trafﬁc  conditions 
are  deteriorating  most  rapidly  in  Beijing,  China.62
In mid-2010, an ‘epic’ 100-kilometre, 9-day trafﬁc
jam was reported in China’s Heibei Province – along
a  freeway  that  feeds  into  Beijing.63 The  growing
popularity of helicopters is partly a response to the
rising congestion problem in Latin American cities
such as Mexico City (Mexico), Santiago (Chile) and
São Paulo (Brazil).64

Congestion  has  widespread  impacts  on  the 
urban quality of life, consumption of fossil fuels, air
pollution and economic growth and prosperity. World
Bank studies from the 1990s estimated that trafﬁc
congestion lowered the GDP of cities by some 3–6
per cent, with the higher value applying mostly to
rapidly  growing  cities  (e.g.  places  with  busy  port
trafﬁc,  reliance  on  just-in-time  inventorying  and
manufacturing, and other time-sensitive activities).65
Time losses from trafﬁc congestion are estimated to
cost the equivalent of 2 per cent of GDP in Europe
and 2–5 per cent in Asia.66 The hidden external costs
of  trafﬁc  congestion  in  Metro  Manila  (the  Philip -
pines), Dakar (Senegal) and Abidjan (Côte d’Ivoire)
have been pegged at nearly 5 per cent of those cities’
GDPs.67 Such costs not only exact a burden on the
present  generation,  but  also  commit  future
generations to long-term debts, which can eventually
slow global growth.

Trafﬁc congestion is a major indication of the
disjuncture  between  land-use  planning  and  trans-
port systems. It not only exposes the limitation of 
a  transport-oriented  bias  to  mobility,  but  it  also
reveals the efﬁciency of land-use systems in a given
city. Limited road capacity, in the face of growing
demand  for  motorized  mobility,  partly  explains
deteriorating trafﬁc conditions. In general, the per -
centage of the total land area devoted to streets68
in  devel op ing-country  cities  is  considerably  lower 
than in the cities of developed countries.69 In India,
the annual growth rate in trafﬁc during the 1990s
was  around  5  per  cent  in  Mumbai,  7  per  cent  in
Chennai and 10 per cent in Delhi. However, none
of these cities have expanded their road supply by
even 1 per cent annually.70

In  most  devel op ing-country  cities,  the  inade -
quate quantity and structure of road infra structure
is often associated with rapid population growth. For
instance, Nairobi, Kenya – a city with approximately
3.5 million inhabitants – has a shortage of collector
streets  and  major  thorough fares  to  serve  trafﬁc
demands,  compared  to  devel oped-country  cities 
of a similar size. The city’s arterials are mostly radial
and the lack of circumferential roads force-funnels
many peripheral trips through the central business
district, with widespread effects on trafﬁc ﬂows.71
Central  Bangkok,  Thailand,  has  a  ﬁshbone  street
pattern, featuring narrow local streets that channel
most motorized trips onto oversaturated thorough -
fares.  The  absence  of  many  collector-dis tributor

roads has contributed to inefﬁcient patterns of trafﬁc
ﬂows.72

Congested  road  infra struc ture  in  develop-
ing countries, is further exacerbated by forms of en -
croachment  onto  the  carriageway,  or  excessive
provisions for local access. The most common forms
of  encroachment  are  caused  by  street  hawkers 
and informal trans port operators, which combine to
block  the  smooth  ﬂow  of  trafﬁc.  In  Sub-Saharan
Africa,  street  vendors  occupy  around  a  third  of 
road space in crowded cities.73 A further congestion-
related prob lem is the absence of trafﬁc management
in  many  devel op ing  countries.  Phnom  Penh,  Cam -
bodia – a city of nearly 2 million inhabitants – has
864 kilometres of roads, but just 36 trafﬁc signals.74
In Lebanon, congestion is made worse by inadequate
road signage, a failure to manage limited supplies of
parking and a culture of aggressive, unruly driving.75
Freight  movements  can  also  contribute  to
congestion.  In  most  poor  countries,  the  goods-
movement sector lacks basic infra struc ture, such as
freight terminals, warehousing, parking and staging
areas, freight-forwarding centres and other logistical
needs.  Few  devel op ing-country  cities  speciﬁcally 
plan for freight movements, thus a haphazard, dys -
func tional  arrangement  of  urban  logistics  is  often 
the  rule.  An  example  is  Lomé,  Togo,  where  the
absence of a bypass road around the city causes trucks
to  leave  the  port  and  head  directly  into  the  core 
of the city.76 Heavy trucks contribute to (and suffer
from)  poor-quality  roads  –  because  wear-and-tear
expo nentially  rises  with  the  dead-axle  weight  of  a
vehicle (e.g. one heavily loaded truck can inﬂict as
much road damage as 10,000 passing cars).77 Conse -
quently, road decay worsens congestion and increases
the operating costs.

SUS TAIN ABILITY
CHALLENGES OF URBAN
MOBILITY
Building on the seminal Brundtland Report of 1987,78
a  sus tain able urban  mobility  system  is  one  that
satisﬁes  current  mobility  needs  of  cities  without
compromising  the  ability  of  future  generations  to
meet their own needs.79 The idea of sus tain ability
in  urban  mobility  has  moved  beyond  a  focus  on
ecology and the natural environ ment to also include
social,  economic  and  institutional  dimensions.
Further more, it has moved beyond the preoccupation
with movement and ﬂows within urban settings to
looking at enhancing proximity in space. A holistic
and integrated approach to urban land-use and trans -
port  planning  and  investment  is  needed  if  urban 
areas  are  to  become  socially,  environ mentally  and
economically sus tain able.

Accordingly,  four  pillars  of  sus tain ability  are
considered  in  the  review  and  analysis  of  urban
mobility in this report; namely the social, environ -
mental, economic and institutional dimensions.
These  are  not  separate  or  isolated,  as  there  are
important  synergies  and  co-beneﬁts.  For  instance,
pursuing  economic  sus tain ability  can  also  confer
environ mental beneﬁts, such as instituting taxation
policies  that  also  conserve  energy.  In  the  early 
2000s,  Japan  phased  in  reduced  ownership  taxes 
on fuel-efﬁcient vehicles by 25 to 50 per cent and
imposed  higher  charges  on  large-engine  vehicles,
including vehicles that were more than ten years of
age.80 While regulatory and ﬁscal instruments can be
used to promote urban sus tain ability, as mentioned
earlier, the most effective mechanism is the effective
utilization of the planning process.

Integration of land-use and trans port
planning
As pointed out in the preceding sections, the ultimate
goal  of  mobility  is  the  capacity  to  traverse  urban
space.  Relationships  between  locations,  as  well  as
impedi ments and conveniences between them, are
critical in determining the ease and convenience of
accessing them. The devel op ment of a sus tain able
transport ation system starts with the organization of
urban space. The main objective is to reduce the need
for  mobility  by  reducing  the  number  of  trips  and
length of travel distance. As a result, urban density
is  optimized  and  functionality  of  urban  places
enhanced. Sus tain ability entails a shift of emphasis
from  transportation  to  people  and  places.  In
operational terms, it still calls for improvement in
transportation  systems  and  even  advocates  for
innovations in other modes of communication, while
giving emphasis to streamlining space utilization in
its relationship with people.

Neglecting the connection between land use and
mobility has created the urban sprawl evidenced in
most cities today. During the period since the Second
World  War,  the  urban  land  area  in  developed
countries has doubled, while it has grown by a factor
of  ﬁve  in  devel op ing  countries.81 From  1995  to
2005, 85 per cent of the 78 largest cities in developed
countries  experi enced  a  faster  growth  in  their
suburban areas than their urban cores.82 In Europe,
studies  of  land-cover  changes  reveal  that  cities  in
Estonia, Latvia, Croatia, Slovakia, Poland, Hungary and
Bulgaria are experiencing the most sprawl.83

In  many  devel op ing  countries,  urban  sprawl
comprises of two main contrasting types of devel op -
ment in the same city. The ﬁrst is characterized by
large  peri-urban  areas  with  informal  and  illegal
patterns of land use. This is combined with a lack of
infra struc ture, public facilities and basic services, and
is often accompanied by little or no public trans port
and by inadequate access roads. The other is a form

Planning and Design for Sustainable Urban Mobility

The urban form –
emerging either
from a haphazard
process of
locating
settlements and
activities, or from
strategically
planned
intervention –
makes a big
difference in
mobility systems

Urban transport is
socially
sustainable when
mobility beneﬁts
are equally and
fairly distributed,
with few if any
inequalities in
access to
transport
infrastructure and
services based on
income, social and
physical
differences

of ‘suburban sprawl’ in which residential zones for
high- and middle-income groups and highly valued
commercial and retail complexes are well connected
for private motorized vehicles rather than by public
transport.

In the absence of regulatory controls and far-
sighted urban planning, the pace of sprawl will most
likely accelerate. Spread-out patterns of growth not
only increase the dependence on the private car, but
also  consume  farmland  and  open  space,  threaten
estuaries and natural habitats, and burden municipal
treasuries with the high costs of expanding urban
infra struc ture and services.

Land-use planning also entails paying attention
to the multiple scales of urban mobility. It traverses
from the regional and metropolitan levels, through
the city linkages and down to the neigh bour hood and
street level. The urban form – emerging either from
a  haphazard  process  of  locating  settlements  and
activities, or from strategically planned intervention
–  makes  a  big  difference  in  mobility  systems.
Similarly, the design of streets and neigh bour hood
blocks promotes a sense of place and determines the
accessibility  of  such  neigh bour hoods.  The  very
physical  conﬁguration  of  the  street  may  either
encourage or discourage walking and bicycling. Key
considerations for sus tain able mobility include the
pattern of street arrangement, the length of blocks
and the relationship of buildings to pathways, stations
and central places.

The percentage of urban land allocated to streets
is one of the factors that inﬂuence the level of con -
nectivity within urban areas. Another factor is how
appropriately the streets are laid out to cater for the
various mobility modes used within the city. A study
found  that  a  large  number  of  cities  in  devel op ing
countries  have  low  percentages  of  urban  land
allocated to streets; for example, 6 per cent in Bangui
(Central African Republic), 6.1 per cent in Yerevan
(Armenia), 11.1 per cent in Accra (Ghana) and 12.3
per cent in Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso).84 This is
despite  the  fact  that  these  cities  are  experiencing
rapid rates of urbanization, a phenomenon which is
poised to impact on their mobility and hence levels
of accessibility. The same study found that cities in
developed countries had signiﬁcantly higher percent -
ages  of  land  allocated  to  streets,  the  average  rate
being 29 per cent.85 The linkages between urban land
allocated to streets and the planning of accessible
cities are discussed further in Chapter 5.

Land-use and trans port planning have been called
for and to some extent addressed since the 1970s.
Nevertheless,  a  persisting  challenge  remains  the
application  of  integrated  land-use  and  trans port
planning in practice, as well as dealing with existing
trans port infra struc ture and land-use patterns that
cannot always be easily changed, particularly in old
middle-size  or  larger  cities.  Accordingly,  research
needs to be directed to such pragmatic issues. It is

in  making  such  critical  decisions  with  respect  to
places and people that the pillars and principles of
sus tain ability can be operationalized.

Social dimensions
Urban trans port is socially sus tain able when mobility
beneﬁts are equally and fairly distributed, with few
if any inequalities in access to trans port infra struc -
ture and services based on income, social and physical
differences (including gender, ethnicity, age or dis -
abilities).  Social  sus tain ability  is  rooted  in  the
principle  of  accessibility  wherein  equality  exists
among all groups in terms of access to basic goods,
services  and  activities  –  such  as  work,  education,
medical care, shopping, socializing – and to enable
people to participate in civic life. It recognizes the
critical importance of mobility and accessibility in fully
enjoying human rights.

As  earlier  indicated,  one  important  aspect  of
accessibility is the affordability of trans port modes.
Affordable  transportation  means  that  people,
including those with low incomes, can afford access
to basic services and activities (healthcare, shopping,
school,  work  and  social  activities)  without  budget
strain.  For  many  urban  dwellers  in  devel op ing
countries, the availability of reliable and affordable
public  trans port services  can  be  the  difference
between  being  integrated  into  the  economic  and
social  life  of  a  city  or  not.  Unaffordable  mobility
prevents the urban poor from breaking out of the
shackles of inter-generational poverty. Further more,
exorbitant  expenditures  on  public  trans port take
money away from other essential needs, such as food,
health care, education and shelter.

Where govern ments are unable to construct and
subsidize public trans port services, travellers often
have to pay large, sometimes exorbitant, shares of
their incomes to private, often informal, paratransit
operators.  Setting  prices  at  whatever  amount  the
market  will  bear,  informal  operators  invariably 
charge  more  per  kilometre  travelled  than  publicly
supported ones. In the poor informal housing settle -
ments on the outskirts of Mexico City – beyond the
service  juris diction  of  the  city’s  metro  system  –
residents  some times  take  two  to  three  separate
collectivos (shared-ride taxis and microbuses) to reach
a metro terminal that provides low-cost connections
to the city and job opportunities.86 Travel can con -
sume 25 per cent or more of daily wages.87 Time costs
can  also  be  exorbitant:  20  per  cent  of  workers  in
Mexico City spend more than three hours travelling
to and from work each day.88 Studies show that taking
a series of informal mini buses and motorized tricycles
to and from work can cost 20 to 25 per cent of daily
wages in rapidly growing cities such as Delhi (India),
Buenos  Aires  (Argentina)  and  Manila  (the  Philip -
pines), and as much as 30 per cent in Nairobi (Kenya),
Pretoria (South Africa) and Dar es Salaam (Tanzania).89

The Urban Mobility Challenge

Social  sus tain ability  also  has  gender,  age  and
disability dimensions. A majority of women in many
parts of the world are less likely to have access to
individual means of transport, be they cars or bikes:
in Bamako (Mali), 87 per cent of women versus 57
per cent of men walk for virtually all trips; in Chennai
(India),  83  versus  63  per  cent;  and  in  Chengdu
(China), 59 versus 39 per cent.90 In addition, women
often create complex trip chains – e.g. taking children
to school followed by shopping and other errands –
so  as  to  make  traditional  ﬁxed-route  bus  services
impractical, forcing them to rely on more expensive
door-to-door  services  (whether  by  private  car  in
developed countries or by rickshaws, bicycles, motor -
cycle  taxis  in  poorer  countries).  Other  transport-
related  burdens  faced  by  women  are:  lack  of
pave ments and safe crosswalks; sexual harassment
in over crowded buses; and personal security threats
from unlighted streets and public trans port stops.

In  many  developed  countries,  the  elderly  and
disabled have statutory rights that guarantee equal
and  full  accessibility  to  public  facilities  like  pave -
ments, rail-based public trans port and buses, such
as legislated in the Americans with Disabilities Act
in the US. Few devel op ing countries provide such
protection,  or  design  streets  and  trans port  infra -
struc ture, to enable access for the elderly and dis -
abled. Young people constitute a group at further risk
of  trans port  dis advan tage.  In  Sub-Saharan  Africa,
school-age  children  and  youth  often  walk  long
distances, along congested corridors, to reach schools,
exposing  them  to  accident  risks  and  all  sorts  of
hardships and deprivations.91

Safety is a crucial aspect of a high-quality urban
mobility system. It includes the safety of infra struc -
tures  and  of  the  rolling  stock,  as  well  as  citizen’s
safety  in  reaching  the  system  (e.g.  walking  from
home to the bus stop). Road accidents have become
a  global  pandemic.  Each  year,  around  1.2  million
people are killed and a further 20–50 million injured
in road trafﬁc accidents worldwide.92 Road crashes
result in economic costs of up to 3 per cent of GDP.93
The  vast  majority  of  road  trafﬁc  accident  deaths
(more than 90 per cent) occur in devel op ing coun -

tries,94 despite these countries accounting for only
33 per cent of the world’s motor vehicles.95 Road
safety levels differ sharply between devel op ing and
developed countries and the gap is widening. In the
latter part of the twentieth century, road accident
fatalities fell in developed countries but rose sharply
elsewhere – e.g. 300 per cent increase from 1980
to 2000 in Africa.96 The World Health Organization
(WHO)  predicts  road  trafﬁc  deaths  in  low-income
countries will more than double between 2005 and
2030, while they are expected to fall in wealthier
nations.97 Rapid  urbanization,  greater  reliance  on
motorized  trans port to  move  people  and  goods,
growing income disparities and lax enforcement of
trafﬁc laws, are among the factors that account for
rising road trafﬁc crashes and fatalities.98

Environ mental dimensions
Many of the environ mental challenges in the urban
trans port sector  are  rooted  in  its  reliance  on  the 
non-renewable  fossil  fuel  to  propel  private  motor
vehicles. The share of the world’s oil consumption
accounted  for  by  transportation  increased  from 
45.4  per  cent  in  1973  to  61.5  per  cent  in  2010, 
with  the  sector  expected  to  continue  to  sustain 
the increasing demands for oil (Figure 1.5). World
reserves of conventional oil exceed what has been
used  to  date,  but  with  rapid  motorization,  many
observers believe it is unlikely that this energy source
will last beyond the mid-century mark.99 As demand
for transportation fuels rises, prices increase.100 End
consumers have to cope with a rise in prices of petrol
and diesel fuels for motorized travel.

Rising  greenhouse  gas  emissions  and  global
temperatures  underscore  the  urgency  of  weaning 
the  trans port  sector  from  its  dependency  on  oil 
and  automobility.  Globally,  13  per  cent  of  all
greenhouse gas emissions come from the trans port
sector and three-quarters of this is caused by road
transport.101 By 2050, global carbon dioxide (CO2)
emissions  from  motor  vehicle  use  could  be  three
times as large as they were in 2010.102 The trans -
port sector’s footprint, however, varies widely across

Planning and Design for Sustainable Urban Mobility

The urban

economically
sustainable when
resources are
efﬁciently used
and distributed to
maximize the
beneﬁts and
minimize the
external costs of
mobility

cities, accounting for 11 per cent of greenhouse gas
emissions in Shanghai and Beijing (China), 20 per
cent in New York City (US) and London (UK), 35
per cent in Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) and Mexico City,
45 per cent in Houston and Atlanta (US), and 60 per
cent in São Paulo (Brazil).103 Levels of energy con -
sumption for trans port vary signiﬁcantly even among
cities with similar GDPs, depending on urban form,
ﬁnancing and taxation policies, and the quality and
affordability of alternative modes. As urban form gets
more compact and dense, CO2 emissions from trans -
port decline. For instance, Austria’s urban areas are
more than four times denser than Australia’s, and
generate only 60 per cent of the amount of CO2 per
capita that Australia’s urban areas generate.104 Mode
share is also an important factor: energy consumption
levels decrease as the share of trips on public trans -
port and non-motorized modes increases. In 2007,
per capita energy con sumption in the trans port sector
was more than three times higher in the US than in
Japan and Germany.105 This is partly explained by the
modal share in these countries; in Japan, for example,
40 per cent of all urban motorized trips are made by
public transport, compared to only 4 per cent in the
US.106 Indeed, greenhouse gas emissions per passen -
ger of public trans port (bus, rail and trams) is about
one-twelfth that of the car.107

The urban trans port sector is also a major source
of air and noise pollution, with serious public health
impacts. Long-term repeated exposure to high levels
of ozone and particulates can diminish lung functions
and trigger asthma and other respiratory illnesses.

Economic dimensions
The urban trans port sector is economically sus tain -
able when  resources  are  efﬁciently  used  and
distributed to maximize the beneﬁts and minimize
the external costs of mobility. This safeguards invest -
ments in and maintenance of trans port infra struc ture
and assets. The translation of investments into walk -
ways, bikeways, railways and roadways creates jobs,
encou rages  business  expansion  and  increases
economic output. Increasingly, the litmus test of cost-
effective  trans port  infra struc ture  is  whether  the
project is ‘bankable’ – capable of attracting loans and
private investors.

Urban trans port infra struc ture is expensive. It
can  consume  a  large  share  of  the  public  budget 
in emerging economies. In Ho Chi Minh City, Viet
Nam, a US$5 billion subway is currently under con -
struction and in Jakarta, Indonesia, a new ring road
is  expected  to  cost  a  similar  amount.108 Crafting
reliable and equitable funding programmes for trans -
port infra struc ture that reward efﬁcient and sus tain -
able behaviour remains a formidable challenge.

Public trans port often faces serious ﬁscal chal -
lenges. Almost universally, public trans port systems
rely  on  public  subsidies.  Cities  that  ﬁnance  the 

costs of public trans port operations can face severe
ﬁscal  burdens.  Experi ences  show  that  in  many 
cases operating subsidies are used to ﬁnance higher
worker compensation and beneﬁt packages, without
com mensurate  improvements  in  public  trans port
services.109 In devel op ing countries, cities without
adequate ﬁscal resources end up relying on informal
sector operators to ﬁll the gaps. Lower-income cities
that borrow funds in foreign currency to build trans -
port infra struc ture also face the risk of having to pay
back loans with devalued local currency.

Another ﬁscal challenge cities face worldwide
is paying for ongoing road maintenance and expan -
sion. Taxes on fuels are usually the primary means
of funding road infra struc ture. However, increased
fuel economy, combined with travel saturation, has
reduced such revenues in developed countries. For
example, fuel economy improvements in France that
reduce CO2 emissions of the average diesel car from
160 to 130 grams per kilometre, have at the same
time dramatically reduced govern ment revenues.110
This has called for a shift to kilometre-based taxes,
something which is now possible given technological
advances such as global positioning systems (GPS)
and radio frequency identiﬁcation devices.

Institutional and governance dimensions
Translating visions and plans for sus tain able urban
mobility depends on the presence of supportive and
nurturing governance, as well as sound institutional
and  regulatory  structures.  The  ability  to  manage 
and respond to escalating demands for urban travel
–  i.e.  to  plan,  predict,  foresee,  preserve  rights-of-
way, build, operate and maintain facilities – is often
limited in devel op ing countries. The lack of adequate
institutional  capacity  –  whether  in  the  form  of  a
trained  and  educated  civil-service  talent  pool,  or 
a  transparent  and  largely  corruption-free  procure-
ment process for providing trans port infra struc ture
and services – poses immense challenges in advancing
sus tain able urban transport.

Institutional  fragmentation  undermines  the
ability to coordinate urban transportation services.111
Separating  urban  sector  functions  into  different
organizations  –  each  with  its  own  boards,  staff,
budgets  and  by-laws  –  often  translates  into  uni-
sectoral actions and missed opportunities, such as
the  failure  to  site  new  housing  projects  near  BRT
stations. Multiple public trans port service providers
can  mean  uncoordinated  bus  and  rail  schedules,
multiple fare payments (which increase user costs)
and  facility  designs  that  are  poorly  integrated.  In
addition,  bloated  bureaucracies  are  notorious  for
waste and delays in the deployment of urban trans -
port projects.

Another  institutional  void  is  the  minimal
involvement of citizens and broad-based community
interests in the planning and design of urban trans -

to  be  more  inclusive,  transparent  and  democratic.
Decen tralizing decision-making ensures greater voice
and  legitimacy  to  non-govern mental  organizations
(NGOs) and civil society.

Lack  of  capacity  for  strategic  planning  and
coordination is a major problem in many cities of the
world, particularly in devel op ing countries. Institu -
tions rarely have sufﬁcient time or funds to expand
trans port infra struc ture fast enough to accommodate
travel demands. The ability to advance sus tain able
mobility programmes or introduce efﬁcient pricing
schemes presumes something that rarely exists – a
well-managed trans port authority that sets clear and
measurable objectives and rigorously appraises the
expenditure of funds in a transparent and accountable
manner.112 Often, the mechanisms for coordinated
multi-sectoral  planning  are  either  weak  or  absent.
Understanding  the  linkage  between  land-use  and
urban trans port planning is important for the multi -
plicity of actors, levels and institutions involved.

CONCLUDING REMARKS
AND STRUCTURE OF THE
REPORT
This chapter has provided an overview of the implica -
tions of the unfolding events of rapid urbanization,
hyper-mobility and the health and climate hazards
associated with car-dependent cities – all of which
are inextricably linked. During the past 100 years,
the structural foundations for today’s urban mobility
systems were derived from devel op mental circum -
stances, when resources were cheap, urban popula -
tions were low and modes of com munication were
limited. However, while the global trends discussed
in this chapter pose uncertainties and risks, there are
also unprecedented opportunities for advancing sus -
tain able urban mobility.

In  order  to  become  more  sus tain able,  cities
should be more compact, encourage mixed land use
and prioritize sus tain able modes of mobility such as
public  and  non-motorized  transport.  Further more,
urban mobility systems need to be inclusive, providing
mobility  opportunities  for  all.  Improved  urban
planning will be critical toward designing and retro -
ﬁtting  cities  to  better  accommodate  sus tain able
modes. Compact, mixed-use cities with high-quality
pedestrian and cycling infra struc ture, combined with
policy measures that charge the true social cost of

using private motorized vehicles, offer the best hope
of increasing the modal shares of sus tain able modes
of mobility.

A paradigm shift is also needed in how trans -
port users think about transportation and its relation-
ship to the city. Of particular signiﬁcance is the need
for govern ment institutions and planning processes
to  emphasize  accessibility  over  mobility.  Further -
more, policies to encourage sus tain able urban mobil -
ity should take into account social, environ mental,
eco nomic as well as institutional dimensions of sus -
tain ability. This calls for a more holistic and inclusive
framework for the planning, design and provision of
urban  mobility  systems  and  services.  Accordingly,
translating  visions  and  plans  for  sus tain able urban
trans port futures  depends  on  the  presence  of  a
supportive governance and regulatory structure.

The following nine chapters of this report analyse
global trends, conditions and policy responses with
respect  to  urban  mobility.  They  investigate  the
connection between trans port and various aspects 
of  urban  form,  and  suggest  measures  towards  the
promotion  of  sus tain able mobility.  The  discussion 
in  the  next  three  chapters  focuses  on  trends  and
conditions with respect to the two main categories
of urban transport: passen ger trans port in Chapters
2  and  3  and  goods  trans port in  Chapter  4.  The
evidence  presented  in  these  chapters  shows  that,
urban  trans port policy  and  planning  challenges  in
devel op ing countries and countries with economies
in transition differ signiﬁcantly from those found in
the urban areas of developed countries; as do the
resources and institutional frameworks at the disposal
of policy-makers and planners. Notwithstanding, the
best choice of policy responses will also vary within
each region and even within countries.

Chapter 5 serves as the anchor of this report,
exposing the basis of the prevailing anomalies and
opportunities for corrective intervention. It looks at
the  interrelation  between  mobility  and  the  spatial
structure  of  the  city,  while  stressing  the  need  to
reconﬁgure urban form to enhance accessibility. The
importance  of  integrating  trans port  and  land-use
planning is emphasized while the underlying prin -
ciples  of  sus tain able devel op ment  provide  the
normative framework for change. The policy impli -
ca tions  discussed  in  Chapter  5  lay  the  ground  for 
the subsequent discussion in Chapters 6 to 9, which
focus  on  the  social,  environ mental,  economic  and
institu tional  dimensions  of  sus tain able mobility.
Chapter 10 concludes the report and presents policy
recom mendations on how to enhance the sus tain -
ability of urban mobility systems.

Lack of capacity
for strategic
planning and
coordination is a
major problem in
many cities of the

in developing
countries

In order to
become more
sustainable, 
cities should be
more compact,

32 In varying degrees an

observation made by the
governor of New york
resonates for many cities in the

world. He said that ‘the simple
truth is that New york’s state
and local govern ments have
become too big, too expensive,
and too ineffective. In fact, there
now are more than 1,000 state
agencies – an ever proliferating
tangle of boards, commissions,
councils, departments, divisions,
offices, task forces and public
authorities. likewise, New
york’s antiquated system of
local govern ment today consists
of more than 10,500 govern -
mental entities. This oversized
and inefficient bureaucracy is a
luxury taxpayers cannot afford’

THE STATE OF URBAN 
PASSENGER TRANSPORT

In a world that is
predominantly
urban, the ability
of people to move
within cities to
access jobs,
services and
amenities is a
critical driver of
sustainability

In a world that is predominantly urban, the ability
of  people  to  move  within  cities  to  access  jobs,
services and amenities is a critical driver of sus tain -
ability. Indeed, access to affordable, safe and environ -
mentally friendly means of trans port is a prerequisite
for the wellbeing of urban dwellers as well as for the
balanced functioning and prosperity of cities. While
progress has been made in this respect, considerable
chal lenges  remain  in  widening  the  accessibility  of 
sus tain able trans port in cities across the world. While
devel op ing countries are disproportionately shoulder -
ing an overwhelming share of the urban trans port
challenges, developed countries also face their own
array of difﬁculties, compounded currently by under -
currents of global ﬁnan cial uncertainty.

This chapter provides an overview of the state
of  urban  passen ger  trans port globally,  focusing  on
four key modes of trans port namely non-motorized
trans port (NMT), formal public transport, informal
(motorized) trans port and private motorized trans -
port (Box 2.1). Goods movement in urban areas is
covered in Chapter 4, given its unique and crucial
yet often overlooked role. The four modes of passen -
ger  trans port are  reviewed  here  in  the  context  of
developed  and  devel op ing  countries,  illustrating

extensive vari ation in trends and conditions, and thus
accessibility (as elaborated in Chapter 1). The impacts
of these trends and conditions are highlighted brieﬂy
as a precursor to a more detailed review of the same
in Chapters 6, 7 and 8.

This review illustrates the central role of NMT
in  devel op ing  countries  and  a  growing  interest  in
these modes in developed countries. Formal public
trans port has  varying  levels  of  importance  within,
and/or  between,  cities  of  both  devel op ing  and
developed  countries.  Informal  transport,  although
playing  a  limited  role  in  developed  countries,  is
found to be the principal trans port mode in devel -
op ing countries, to the extent that in some it is being
co-opted as part of formal public trans port provision.
Thereafter, the enormous growth in private motor -
ized  trans port in  many  devel op ing  countries  is
reviewed, as are the patterns of dependence on this
mode  in  developed  countries.  Importantly,  also, 
the chapter considers the critical role of integration
across  different  modes  of  trans port  in  cities,  and
highlights experi ences of cities that have invested in
intermodality.

The  trends  and  conditions  of  urban  trans port
described  in  this  chapter  have  been  directly

Box 2.1  Modes of urban transport

Non-motorized transport refers to the transportation of
passengers via human or animal powered means including
bicycles, rickshaws, pedicabs, animal-drawn carts and walking.
With animal power being largely a rural feature, the focus in
this report is on human-powered modes (bicycles, cycle
rickshaws) and walking.
Formal public transport services are those available to the
public for payment, run on speciﬁed routes to timetables with
set fares, and within the context of this report, in an urban
area. They may be operated by public or private organizations
and cover a wide range of modes, namely bus, light rail
(tramways and street cars), metros, suburban rail, as well as
waterborne transport (ferries, boats).

Informal (motorized) transport (also referred to as
‘paratransit’) relies on privately owned vehicles whose
operators often lack necessary permits or do not meet
requirements for vehicle size, insurance coverage or driver
standards. Even if some operators are fully licensed, they may
deviate from routes or charge unauthorized higher fares, as a
result of which they are considered informal.
Private motorized transport involves vehicles that are
powered by an engine and are used by individuals or private
companies to transport passengers. Light-duty vehicles (cars,
SUVs, light trucks and mini-vans) and two- or three-wheelers
remain the key modes of private motorized transport in urban
areas.

Planning and Design for Sustainable Urban Mobility

inﬂuenced by land-use and urban planning decisions
taken  at  neigh bour hood,  local  and  regional  levels
(Chapter  5),  resulting  in  particular  urban  forms 
and functionality that hinder or facilitate accessibility.
In  turn,  trans port  investments  and  policies  have
inﬂuenced  the  devel op ment  of  urban  form  and
functionality in particular ways, thereby impacting on
access  to  mobility.  The  interaction  between  the
devel op ment of urban spatial patterns and trans port
is thus a key factor shaping accessibility in cities both
in physical and socioeconomic terms.

NON-MOTORIZED 
TRANSPORT
This section highlights the trends and conditions of
NMT  around  the  world,  including  the  provision 
of appropriate infra struc ture, as well as the related
beneﬁts  and  challenges.  Globally,  walking  and
bicycling are the dominant modes of NMT. Yet, the
needs of NMT users are often ignored, while pedes -
trians and cyclists together form a signiﬁcant fraction
of trafﬁc accident victims. Most cities do not have
dedicated infra struc ture, and even if some European
cities have been remodelled to become pedestrian
and bicycle friendly, NMT users typically negotiate
hostile  urban  environ ments.  In  London,  UK,  for
instance, many cyclists are killed annually by turning
trucks, despite the presence of bicycle lanes.

Devel op ing countries
NMT is the principal mode of transportation in most
cities of devel op ing countries, particularly Africa and
Asia (Figure 2.1). In Dakar (Senegal), for instance,
walking and cycling accounts for 71 per cent of trips
while in Douala (Cameroon) it accounts for 60 per
cent. In Asia, the combined average share of cycling
and walking in Chinese cities, for instance, is 65 per
cent.1 Beijing, for instance, has a combined modal
share of walking and cycling of 53 per cent. In Indian
cities  (such  as  Ahmedabad,  Bangalore,  Delhi  and
Mumbai)  walking  and  cycling  account  for  about  a
third  of  all  trips.  In  Latin  America,  walking  and
cycling constitute more than one-third of the trips
in cities such as Santiago, Chile (37 per cent), Rio
de  Janeiro,  Brazil  (37  per  cent)  and  Guadalajara,
Mexico (39 per cent), but are less signiﬁcant in others
such as Buenos Aires, Argentina (9 per cent), La Paz,
Bolivia (10 per cent) and Caracas, Venezuela (18 per
cent).2

Walking is the principal means of transportation
in cities of devel op ing countries. This is largely not
by choice, but rather driven by the lack of affordable
and  accessible  alternatives,  with  most  pedestrians
belonging  to  lower  income  groups.3 Among  low-

income groups in Santiago (Chile), NMT provides a
modal share of over 50 per cent, compared to only
10 per cent among high-income groups.4 In Kenya,
the majority of Nairobi’s slum inhabitants walk as they
cannot  afford  motorized  transport.5 On  average,
walking accounts for a signiﬁcant proportion of trips
in African cities, and is particularly common among
women and children.6

Cycling caters for the mobility needs of consid -
erable  numbers  of  urban  dwellers  in  devel op ing-
country cities, especially in Asia. In mainland China,
bicycle ownership is much higher than in other Asian
countries, with an estimated 600 million bicycles.7
In  India,  household  bicycle  ownership  rates  are 
high in cities such as Delhi (38 per cent), Ahmedabad
(54 per cent) and Chandigarh (63 per cent).8 This 
is reﬂected in the relatively higher modal share of
cycling  in  these  cities  –  Delhi  (12  per  cent)  and
Ahmedabad (14 per cent). In some Asian countries
with relatively higher incomes, however, the modal
share of cycling is much lower, such as in Singapore
(1.6 per cent of work trips),9 the Republic of Korea
(1.2 per cent)10 and Hong Kong SAR (0.5 per cent).11
In  recent  years,  there  has  been  a  decline  in
cycling in some Asian cities. This has been attributed
to rising incomes and concomitant motorization, as
well as changing social perceptions, which tends to
see cycling as a means of trans port for the poor. India
is a case in point where bicycle modal shares declined
from 30 per cent in 1994 to 11 per cent in 2008.12
Numbers also decreased in China, particularly in big
cities.13

In African cities, cycling plays a comparatively
limited role, accounting for less than 3 per cent of
total  trips  in  capital  cities  such  as  Bamako  (Mali),
Dakar (Senegal), Harare (Zimbabwe), Nairobi (Kenya)
and  Niamey  (Niger).  Cycling  appears  to  be  more
popular  in  smaller  and  secondary  cities  such  as
Morogoro (Tanzania) and Eldoret (Kenya) where it
constitutes 23 per cent and 12 per cent of total trips,
respectively.14 In  Latin  America,  cycling  makes  up
only a small share of total trans port trips, with bicycle
use being more in intermediate sized cities than in
larger ones. For example, while in Curico (Chile) the
modal share is 9 per cent, the average share across
Chile is under 2 per cent.15

The three-wheeled rickshaw is a popular type
of urban trans port in Asia, especially in Cambodia,
Indonesia, Myanmar, Thailand, the Philippines and
Viet  Nam.  Known  as  pedicabs  (padyak)  in  Metro
Manila (the Philippines), they are able to operate in
narrow alleys, walkways and other areas which are
impenetrable by other modes such as jeepneys (con -
verted jeep taxis) and buses. In Bandung (Indonesia),
pedicabs known as becaks make up 33 per cent of
all trips.16 In contrast, cycle rickshaws are uncommon
in  Africa,  although  they  did  exist  in  the  1990s  in 
Kigali (Rwanda) and Bujumbura (Burundi).17 The use
of  tricycles  however  has  been  met  with  mixed

reactions by city authorities in several Asian coun-
tries. Jakarta (Indonesia) banned becaks in the 1970s
considering  them  obsolete,  unsafe  and  hindering
trafﬁc  ﬂow,  while  Viet  Nam  banned  tricycles  in
2008.18 In Mandalay (Myanmar), use in the central
business district is limited to daytime.19 The city of
Udon Thani (Thailand), by contrast, is actively pro -
moting cycle rickshaws as an alternative to cars.20

Developed countries
The proportion of non-motorized trips varies greatly
in  developed  countries,  with  walking  and  cycling
making up less than an eighth of daily trips in car-

dependent countries such as Australia, Canada and
the  US,  and  over  20  per  cent  in  most  European
countries. The share of journeys on foot is higher in
European countries, but less than in Australia, Canada
and the US (Figure 2.2).

Bicycle ownership is high in Western Europe,
especially in the Netherlands, Germany and Denmark
(Figure 2.3). This has been attributed to the trans -
port and land-use policies introduced since the mid-
1970s  in  these  countries  in  favour  of  NMT  and
public  trans port facilities  rather  than  motorized
transport.  The  ratio  of  bicycles  to  inhabitants  is
lower in other European countries such as Hungary
and France, as well as in the US and Canada. Cycling

in  the  US  is  mostly  for  recreational  and  ﬁtness
purposes,  whereas  in  Europe  it  is  a  key  means  of
movement for utilitarian purposes.21

A recent trend with respect to NMT in devel -
oped-country  cities  has  been  the  increasing  popu-
larity of three-wheeled pedicabs. For instance, annual
trips by such pedicabs have been estimated at 1 million
in London (UK) and 250,000 in Berlin (Germany).22
Nevertheless, this mode of trans port is still insigniﬁc -
ant in the cities of developed countries.

Infra struc ture for non-motorized
transport
Generally, devel op ing-country cities have poor quality
infra struc ture  for  NMT.  Dedicated  corridors  are
largely absent and, where they exist, they are often
at the risk of being encroached upon for commer-
cial purposes or used for the perennial widening of
motorized carriageways.23 Poor lighting, absence of
footpaths  and  over crowding  make  walking  unsafe 
in  these  countries.24 Further more,  limited  speed
enforcement does little to deter high trafﬁc speeds.
In the absence of segregated NMT infra struc ture, the
dangers  poised  by  speeding  vehicles  result  in  low
cycling  rates.25 The  general  lack  of  provision  and
maintenance of NMT facilities in cities of devel op -

ing countries is primarily a problem of ﬁnancing. Such
facilities  are  not  considered  to  be  ‘revenue-
generating’ and private investors and international
lending agencies are thus not keen to ﬁnance such
expenditures.  Further more,  the  costs  of  such 
NMT facilities are often considered to be beyond city
capabilities.26 However,  as  discussed  later  in  this
report, the result of this is that public expenditures
tend to focus on provision of infra struc ture for the
small minority that can afford to own a private car,
in effect subsidizing the wealthiest road users.

Across  Africa,  provision  for  segregated  infra -
struc ture for NMT is limited. In Nairobi (Kenya), 95
per  cent  of  roads  have  high  pedestrian  ﬂows 
but  only  20  per  cent  have  pedestrian  footpaths,27
while in Kampala (Uganda) more than 60 per cent
of road networks have no footpath segregated from
motor ized trafﬁc. In Lagos (Nigeria), NMT space is
inadequately protected.28 There are some exceptions,
however, such as Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso), where
dedicated lanes were built in the 1980s. Unfortun -
ately,  these  lanes  have  become  unsafe  due  to  the
encroachment by high-speed motorcycles.29

NMT  infra struc ture  conditions  in  most  Asian
cities are similarly inadequate. Out of the transport-
related  projects  approved  under  India’s  Jawaharlal
Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission, only 2.2 per

cent  focused  on  pedestrian  infra struc ture  (Figure
2.4). The majority of the roads in Delhi (India) do
not have pavements and those that exist are often
unusable.30 Some Chinese cities, by contrast, have
excellent bicycle infra struc ture. In the recent past,
however, these have been invaded by electric bikes.31
The elimination or narrowing of sidewalks to accom -
modate more car lanes in Chinese cities has also been
reported.32

Infra struc ture for NMT in some Latin American
cities  is  also  in  poor  repair.  For  instance,  in  Cali,
Colombia,  sidewalks  are  barely  sufﬁcient  for  one
person, poorly maintained, blocked by construction
waste,  parked  vehicles  or  informal  vendors,  and 
have open sewerages. Car access ramps often dis -
criminate  against  the  disabled,  persons  with  high-
heeled  shoes  and  baby  carriages  (mostly  women),
while a lack of lighting encourages the pedestrian 
use of car lanes, and contributes to increased fear
of muggings. Further more, a signiﬁcant proportion
of roads (30 per cent) are unpaved; pedestrians and
cyclists are exposed to dust, mud and air pollution.33
However,  encouraging  measures  to  enhance
NMT  infra struc ture  have  been  observed  in  some
devel op ing  countries.  In  Colombia,  for  example,
Bogotá’s CicloRuta – a 340-kilometre bicycle path that
is connected to BRT routes, parks and community
centres – has registered considerable achievements
and resulted in a doubling of the proportion of the
population  that  used  bikes  between  2000  and
2007.34 The Republic of Korea’s Bicycle Master Plan
intends  to  build  30,000  kilometres  of  bike-ways

(primarily for recreational purposes) and increase the
modal share of cycling to 10 per cent by the end of
2019.35 In China, policies to promote NMT include
planned bicycle networks and parking at public trans -
port stations in Beijing to increase ridership.36 Some
have  also  adopted  bicycle  sharing  systems  where
bicycles are made available for shared use to indi -
viduals on a very short-term basis. The Chinese cities
of Wuhan and Hangzhou have the largest bike sharing
systems in the world, with some 90,000 and 40,000
bikes, respectively.37

In developed countries, pedestrian infra struc ture
has rapidly improved in recent decades with a number
of  Western  European  cities  investing  heavily  in
pedestrian areas and dedicated lanes. In Germany and
the Netherlands, there have been extensive efforts
to  improve  infra struc ture  for  both  walking  and
cycling, with bike paths and lanes more than doub-
ling  in  the  Netherlands  and  tripling  in  Germany
between the late 1970s and mid-1990s (Box 2.2).
In contrast, investments to improve infra struc ture for
walking and cycling in the US have been compara -
tively limited.38

An increasingly important approach in Western
Europe  has  been  the  integration  of  NMT  and
motorized travel through urban design to enhance
the safety and quality of street space for pedestrians
and  cyclists.  Neigh bour hood  streets  have  been
redesigned in numerous cities in the UK, Denmark,
Sweden,  German  and  the  Netherlands  to  create
‘home  zones’  accessible  to  cars,  bicyclists  and
pedestrians on equal terms, resulting in a signiﬁcant

Planning and Design for Sustainable Urban Mobility

Box 2.2  An exercise in cycle-friendly design

In Houten – a new town in the
Netherlands designed in the early 1970s
– cycle routes, with adjoining walkways,
form the backbone of the town plan.
The town consists of a number of neigh -
bour hoods, each connected to the
railway station and the adjoining town
centre by tree-like systems of direct
cycle routes. Cars can enter each neigh -
bour hood by way of an access road
from a ring road that encircles the town.
Access roads are split up as soon as
they enter the neigh bour hood, keeping
the car trafﬁc volume within the neigh -
bour hood low and therefore compatible

with the needs of ordinary, human-
powered road users of all ages. Streets
are designed to keep speeds low (30
kilometres per hour or less) while cars
going from one neigh bour hood to
another, or from a residential area to
the town centre, have to return to the
ring road on the edge of town. This
makes the cycle route shorter than the
motorized route for virtually every trip,
and as a result, cycling and walking
account for a larger share of the modal
split within the town.

that the beneﬁts of expanding NMT use outweigh
the related costs by large margins. For instance, in
Amsterdam (the Netherlands) the overall beneﬁt–cost
ratio of improving bicycle infra struc ture was estim -
ated to be 1.5:1 while similar calculations for Delhi
(India) and Bogotá (Colombia) estimated the ratio to
be 20:1 and 7:1, respectively.42

A  major  advantage  of  NMT  is  that  it  reduces
energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions and
pollution (air, water and noise) substantially, as it does
not rely on fossil fuels unlike other modes of trans -
port in cities (see Chapter 7). Further more, as NMT
requires signiﬁcantly less road space and parking, it
enables the preservation of natural habitats and open
spaces. Cycling and walking can also directly provide
the  daily  physical  activity  required  for  a  healthy
lifestyle. Negative health impacts have been observed
where the share of NMT in urban areas is encroached
by motorization.

Importantly also, the movement of passen gers
through  NMT  supports  urban  livelihoods  in  devel -
oping-country cities. For instance, 20 per cent of the
population  in  Dhaka,  Bangladesh,  rely  on  rickshaw
pulling for their livelihood,43 while ﬁgures of 5–10 per
cent have been reported in the Indian cities of Kolkata,
Chennai, Delhi and Hyderabad. This source of liveli -
hood is particularly important in smaller cities with
limited public trans port services and narrow streets.
Yet,  despite  generating  enormous  beneﬁts  in
cities,  NMT  is  constrained  in  a  number  of  ways.
Perhaps most critical is the risk of injury, with pedes -
trians and cyclists constituting more than 27 per cent
of those killed in road trafﬁc accidents globally, rising
to  a  third  in  low-  and  middle-income  countries.44
Globally, 400,000 pedestrians are killed annually and
vulnerability is accentuated in speciﬁc regions such
as Africa where 38 per cent of those killed in trafﬁc
accidents are pedestrians.45

NMT  faces  the  added  challenge  of  being
marginalized  in  urban  planning  and  investments,
partly due to an absence of adequate information and
data.  External  loan  ﬁnancing  in  many  devel op ing
countries  tends  to  favour  large  projects,  metro
systems and BRT systems. Data on NMT are also often
under-presented in trans port data, resulting in low

increase  in  NMT  use,  enhancing  urban  landscape
aesthetics and boosting the social function of public
spaces.39

In general, with competition for space, speed and
infra struc ture, cyclists and pedestrians are dis advan -
taged in most cities globally. Although NMT sustains
and complements public trans port as a key feeder
service, it is seldom integrated with it and receives
rare  media  coverage.40 In  the  absence  of  strong
policy support for NMT, the requisite infra struc ture
is not created, resulting in a more hostile environ -
ment  with  higher  rates  of  fatal  accidents  and  an
overall decline in cycling. This downward trend is
enhanced by the fact that most NMT users, at least
in devel op ing countries, use NMT due to the lack of
affordable alternatives; they are captive low-income
users. There is thus a social stigma against using NMT
as it is seen as the travel mode of the poor.

Impacts of non-motorized transport
The use of NMT in cities generates numerous social,
economic and environ mental beneﬁts (Table 2.1).41
Indeed, the existing evidence has consistently shown

planning priority given the reliance of policy-making
on mobility data.46 Pedestrians and cyclists may thus
be easily overlooked in planning at the expense of
motorized transport.

Related to the above, the negative public image
of  NMT,  especially  in  devel op ing  countries,  is  an
additional factor in its neglect in planning.47 Among
users themselves the stigma of poverty leads many
to shift to motorized trans port when their incomes
rise. For authorities, devel op ment and modernity is
associated with technology and motorized transport.
Promotion  of  NMT  may  thus  not  be  considered
commensurate with devel op ment.

FORMAL PUBLIC 
TRANSPORT
This  section  reviews  the  trends  and  conditions  of
public trans port globally. The discussion focuses on
services which can be considered as formal according
to the way they are organized or operated to maintain
a level of service, quality, routes, timetables and fare
structures.  High-capacity  public  trans port services 
by  bus  or  rail  –  which  has  signiﬁcant  potential  to
enhance urban accessibility in developed and devel -
op ing countries alike – are examined in greater detail
in Chapter 3, while informal trans port is reviewed
separately later in this chapter.

Overall, the growth of public trans port in some
cities  of  developed  countries  and  stagnation  and
decline  in  cities  of  devel op ing  countries  is  high -
lighted, noting the consequences of restricted ﬁnan -
cial  investments.  The  environ mental,  social  and
economic beneﬁts of public trans port are outlined,
while the desirability of attracting choice riders to
public trans port is discussed together with experi -
ences and challenges of achieving this.

Devel op ing countries
The modal share of public trans port has decreased
or stagnated in most devel op ing-country cities, and
few efﬁcient formal public trans port systems remain.
Public trans port is typically operated by a growing
number  of  entrepreneurial  individuals  or  small/
medium-sized companies, but with low investment
and minimal public support. Public trans port in these
cites  has  been  characterized  by  weak  regulation,
scarcity in supply, poor quality and the predominance
of  informal  sector  operators.  Subsequent  formal -
ization  occasionally  occurs  through  aid-ﬁnancing
arrangements,  for  instance  through  trust  funds
guaranteeing credit lines for vehicle purchase, as in
Dakar  (Senegal),  Johannesburg  (South  Africa)  and
Lagos (Nigeria).48

Some encouraging trends have, however, been
observed. In Africa, BRT systems have been intro -

duced in Lagos (Nigeria) and Johannesburg (South
Africa), generating substantial beneﬁts for residents.49
BRT lines are under construction or planned in other
African cities such as Dar es Salaam (Tanzania), Accra
(Ghana) and Kampala (Uganda). The supply of public
trans port services is also increasing in North Africa,
with light rail and tram systems available in Cairo,
Casablanca, Rabat, Algiers and Tunis. Metro systems
are now servicing the population in Cairo (Egypt) and
Dubai (United Arab Emirates).50 Perhaps most not-
able are China’s growing investments in metro and
BRT  systems,  servicing  millions  of  passen gers  in
urban areas.

Latin  America  has  relatively  good  formalized
public trans port with stronger institutions in plan-
ning and management, while the private sector plays
an  increasingly  important  role  in  cities  such  as
Montevideo (Uruguay), Bogotá (Colombia) and Rio
de Janeiro (Brazil). A growing number of urban BRT
systems in Brazil, Chile, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela
have expanded public trans port services signiﬁcantly.
Beyond  main stream  formal  public  trans port
services, a number of other modes exist in devel op -
ing-country cities, depending on the context-speciﬁc
nature  of  trans port  challenges  and  opportunities.
Waterborne  trans port  also  serves  a  number  of 
cities in devel op ing countries. In Mombasa (Kenya),
the Likoni ferry crossing serves over 200,000 passen -
gers  and  3500  vehicles  daily.51 The  Chao  Phraya
express-boat company in Bangkok (Thailand) trans -
ports 11 million passen gers annually.52 In Colombia,
Medellin’s aerial cable car (Metrocables) moves up
to 3000 passen gers per hour and has been hailed 
as an innovative and high-impact solution that has
dramatically transformed access to public trans port
for  inhabitants  of  informal  settlements  built  on
steeply sloping terrain and hillsides.53

Developed countries
Most cities in developed countries are main taining
or  increasing  the  market  share  of  formal  public
transport.  In  North  America  and  Western  Europe, 
the  annual  number  of  public  trans port passen gers 
has  been  increasing  since  the  1960s  and  1970s,
despite rising car ownership and suburban sprawl.54
Yet, this overall increase masks differences between
and within cities (or countries), as well as the low
growth of public trans port relative to other modes
of transport.

Levels of public trans port use per capita range
from highs of 237 trips per person annually in Swit -
zerland to only 24 trips per capita annually in the
US.55 Although  North  America’s  public  trans port
ridership is slowly growing – especially light rail and
quality bus services in cities that have invested in
public trans port (Toronto, Edmonton and Vancouver
in Canada and Portland in the US)56 – the modal share
of public trans port remains marginal in comparison

to European countries. A signiﬁcant proportion of the
daily trips in European cities like Vienna (Austria) and
Helsinki (Finland) are by public transport, but far less
so in Melbourne (Australia) and Chicago (US) (Figure
2.5). The dramatic overall decline in the importance
of public trans port in Australia since the ﬁrst half of
the  last  decade  has  been  attributed  to  increased
motorization (Figure 2.6).

Good service provision and quality infra struc ture
in many European cities allow public trans port to be

a  lifestyle  choice,  enjoying  increased  patronage,
especially  for  short  inner-city  trips,  although  con -
straints  for  women,  children  and  the  elderly  have
been noted. In Vienna, Austria, for instance, 96 per
cent of residents live within walking distance of a
public trans port stop, formal public trans port use is
high,  and  the  city  is  consistently  rated  highly  for
quality  of  life.57 In  Europe,  there  are  45  metro
systems trans porting 9.9 billion passen gers annually

billion passen gers annually.58 Tramway use is seeing
a  revival  in  devel oped-country  cities,  especially  in
France, Spain, Portugal and the UK, but also in North
America and Australia. Globally, the number of cities
with trams had risen to 400 in 2011(compared to
300 in 1980), and another 100 systems were under
construction or being planned.59 In Eastern European
countries the use of public trans port remains much
higher  than  in  the  rest  of  Europe,  despite  the
debilitating  effects  of  the  end  of  communism  on
public trans port services and use. Nevertheless, the
dense urban rail and trolleybus systems created by
the centralized socialist economies have been largely
neglected and dilap idated amid rapid motorization
and urban sprawl.60

In  terms  of  the  regulatory  aspects  of  public
trans port provision, there has been a notable global
shift  from  publicly  owned  provision  to  a  privately
owned  market-driven  approach  since  the  1980s

(Table 2.2). A separation of organizer, operator and
infra struc ture functions has occurred such that public
authorities  now  oversee,  rather  than  organize  or
deliver,  public  transport.  In  the  European  Union
(EU) for instance, there has been a strong drive for
the deregulation of trans port provision. One of the
earliest experi ences, which would later inﬂuence the
rest of Europe, was the deregulation of the public
trans port market in the UK,61 with private operators
now providing more than 80 per cent of bus services
outside London, leading to both improvements and
setbacks.62

Despite  some  notable  achievements  in  the
expansion  of  public  trans port services,  the  wider
picture  is  fragmented,  with  disparity  in  provision
between regions and countries, and between capitals
and non-capital cities. There are limited statistics on
public  trans port operations  in  cities  of  devel op ing
countries, making comparison difﬁcult.

Infra struc ture for public transport
Globally, there has been a lack of adequate invest -
ment in public transport.63 In most devel op ing coun -
tries,  urban  public  trans port infra struc ture  is  far
from adequate and in poor condition.64 The existing
infra struc ture  is  often  derelict  and  poorly  main-
tained,  which  in  turn  compromises  not  only  the
quality of service, but also the health and safety of
passen gers.  Previously  subsidized  public  trans port
services have also been scaled back or discontinued
amid policies of liberalization and economic reform
in  some  devel op ing  countries.  In  Africa,  publicly
owned and managed public trans port entities were
disbanded in the 1990s owing largely to structural
adjustment policies, leading to years of neglect since
then  and  the  dominance  of  informal  trans port
operations.65

Investments  required  for  urban  public  trans -
port services can be prohibitively high for devel op -
ing countries, as in the case of rail-based trans port
that costs millions of dollars per kilometre.66 Further -
more, the spending on roads for private motorized
trans port remains far higher than on dedicated public
trans port infra struc ture in devel op ing countries (see
for example the case of Africa in Figure 2.7). Much
of the overseas devel op ment assistance received by
devel op ing countries has focused on road building,
although  this  approach  is  now  slowly  changing  in
favour  of  investments  in  more  socially  sus tain able
modes.

The provision of public trans port infra struc ture
is comparatively better in cities in some key emerging
markets,  such  as  South  Africa  and  Brazil  (Figure
2.8).  The  increased  availability  of  bus  trans port
services in most metropolitan areas of India – as a
result of measures taken under the Jawaharlal Nehru
National Urban Renewal Mission – has been noted,

but the services remain unreliable, time-consuming
and  over crowded.67 The  hosting  of  international
events  has  also  driven  major  public  trans port
investments in cities such as Johannesburg (World
Cup,  2010),  Beijing  (Olympics,  2008),  Shanghai
(World Expo, 2010), Delhi (Commonwealth Games,
2010) and Rio de Janeiro (World Cup, 2014).68

In contrast, many cities of developed countries
have  seen  investment  and  improving  services,69
increasingly  through  public–private  partnerships.
During the 1990s average investment remained at
0.45–0.5  per  cent  of  urban  area  GDP,  with  the
higher  levels  in  Madrid  (Spain),  Lisbon  (Portugal),
London  (UK),  Berlin  (Germany),  Vienna  (Austria),
Oslo  (Norway),  Prague  (Czech  Republic)  and  Lille
(France).70 Investment  was  also  sustained  in  high-
income  Asian  countries,  particularly  in  Singapore,
Tokyo (Japan) and Hong Kong (China).71

Impacts of formal public transport
Public trans port systems signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the
economic, environ mental and social fabric of urban
life in positive ways, and form a key prerequisite for
the sus tain able city of the twenty-ﬁrst century. This
mode of trans port moves more people with fewer
vehicles, less energy and smaller space consumption.
Notable among positive environ mental impacts are
lower  emissions  of  airborne  pollutants  and  green -
house gases (see Chapter 7).

The  economic  beneﬁts  of  public  trans port
investment  include  both  direct  job  creation  and
indirect support of manufacturing, construction and
other economic activities. An investment of US$1
billion in public transportation supports 36,000 local
jobs  in  the  US.72 People  living  near  public  trans-
port  services  work  more  days  annually  than  those
without  such  access,  while  public  trans port com -

muters often report that they would not continue 
in current jobs, or would earn less, without public
trans port ser vices.73 A UK Govern ment study showed
that 13 per cent of respondents had not applied for
a particular job in the previous 12 months due to
trans port  problems.74 Further more,  the  economic
beneﬁt of a modal shift to public trans port can be
substantial. In the US, it has been estimated that the
annual economic savings to consumers would exceed
the cost of strategies to encourage such a shift by
approximately US$112 billion.75

Public trans port investments via subsidies can
have a broad effect. Subsidized student and school -
child use (e.g. low-priced student tickets in Western
Europe)  can  provide  guaranteed  revenues  on
uneconomic routes, as in the case of Germany.76 In
the  US,  many  universities  provide  reduced-fare
tickets. Salt Lake City’s TRAX light rail system in this
way  serves  the  University  of  Utah  with  45,000
travellers a week, or 33 per cent of total travel to
the campus.77

In social terms, access to jobs, education, health
services  and  other  facilities  is  increased  by  public
trans port provision;  these  are  central  to  social
inclusion for the dis advan taged. Further more, public
transportation also supports community cohesion by
increasing  the  quantity  and  quality  of  interactions
between people.78 For the youth, public trans port
offers a means of travelling independently, and in
some cases this can delay the desire (or need) to drive
private motorized vehicles.

Public  trans port  tends  to  increase  physical
activity  as  most  trips  include  walking  or  cycling
links.79 Users  average  about  three  times  as  much
walking as people who rely on private cars, nearly
achieving the 22 daily minutes of moderate physical
activity  considered  necessary  for  health  reasons.80
Public  trans port  passen gers  also  have  about  one-
tenth the fatality rate of car occupants and, in terms
of risks to other road users, public trans port causes

less than half the number of deaths per passen ger-
kilometre compared to private cars.81

The limited availability of ﬁnan cial resources for
the  provision  of  public  trans port services  is  a  key
constraint. Often, only a fraction of the necessary
improvements can be implemented from the public
purse. This has ramiﬁcations for both service levels
and  quality.  Under  such  circumstances,  retaining
existing  public  trans port customers,  while  gaining
new ones, becomes particularly difﬁcult. Projections
on  future  population  growth  and  motorized  travel
amid a lack of road capacity, suggest that if public
trans port does not double its modal share, many cities
may well grind to a halt.

The  challenge  is  to  convert  congestion  into
public trans port riders, and overcome dependency
on  private  cars.  Yet,  an  important  precursor  to
increasing  such  ridership  is  the  provision  of  high-
quality  services,  as  clients  value  aspects  such  as
connectivity  and  coordination  of  services,  while
ﬂexibility and trip-chaining is also important, particu -
larly for women.82 Qualitative factors such as conveni -
ence,  comfort,  security  and  prestige  are  valued 
more highly than is assumed by a conventional focus
on  quantitative  factors  such  as  speed  and  price.83
Focusing investments on improving quality of services
may thus be even more effective than eliminating
public trans port fares (Box 2.3).

Security  and  safety  concerns  are  a  barrier  for
public  trans port use  by  children,  women  and  the
elderly  (see  Chapter  6).  over crowding  can  expose
travellers to undesirable behaviour in fellow passen -
gers, and some cities do offer segregation of services
such as in Mexico City (Mexico), Tehran (Iran) and
Dubai  (United  Arab  Emirates),  where  there  are
designated women’s areas on public transport. Also,
although children and youth are high user groups,
keeping these as choice riders as they get older is
not  easy  if  public  trans port is  low  quality  and
perceived as old fashioned.84

Planning and Design for Sustainable Urban Mobility

Box 2.3 Zero-fare public transport?

Would zero-fare public trans port
systems ‘even the playing field’ and
encourage travellers to shift from cars
to public transport? Would free public
trans port be good for society,
particularly lower-income or dis advan -
taged people?

Concession fares are an example

of addressing these social objectives
through partial subsidy. In a zero-fare
public trans port system the entire cost
of the system is subsidized. The passen -
ger does not directly pay for the trip,
the most obvious result being that
people are more likely to use public
transport, as has been the case in
Hasselt, a small city in Belgium. a similar
system associated with tourism is in

place in melbourne, australia. In Tallinn,
Estonia, zero-fare public trans port for all
its 420,000 inhabitants on all public
trans port services run by the city from 1
January 2013 is expected to significantly
increase ridership.

However, meeting dramatically

increased demand in large systems
would require considerable capital
investment. If funds were instead used
to increase service levels, perhaps new
passen gers may be attracted while
maintaining income from existing
passen gers. The income from new
passen gers may then at least partially
offset the costs of the improved service.

Urban planning
and land-use

with transport
demand and ﬁscal
measures – can
encourage a shift
in transport
behaviour towards
public transport

Informal transport
is ﬁrmly

developing-
country cities,
often accounting
for over half of all
motorized trips

The value of expanding public trans port services
to enhance accessible mobility in cities is unques -
tionable.  Urban  planning  and  land-use  policies  –
together with trans port demand and ﬁscal measures
–  can  encourage  a  shift  in  trans port  behaviour
towards public transport. Authorities in many cities
may, however, lack the resources and institutional
capacity necessary to coordinate land-use and trans -
port  planning  so  that  they  generate  such  a  modal
transition.

INFORMAL TRANSPORT
The informal sector – a term describing small-scale
economic  activity  and  unregulated  employment  –
supplies  small-vehicle,  low-performance  services 
that ﬁll the niche between formal taxis and conven -
tional  50-passen ger  capacity  buses.85 This  section
examines  the  conditions  of  informal  trans port
globally, illus trating the dominance of this mode in
devel op ing countries. Informal trans port is often the
only accessible means available in many of the world’s
poorest cities. Although it provides important beneﬁts
to  the  urban  poor,  informal  trans port contributes
signiﬁcantly to congestion, air and noise pollution and
trafﬁc accidents. The role of informal trans port in
complementing formal trans port and in generating
broader social beneﬁt is considered together with the
costs entailed.

Devel op ing countries
Informal trans port is ﬁrmly entrenched in devel op -
ing-country  cities,  often  accounting  for  over  half 

of  all  motorized  trips.  In  Africa,  private  carriers
dominate, mainly mini buses and shared taxis with
schedules  and  fares  varying  with  demand,  routes
being  semi-ﬁxed  and  stopping  points  unregulated.
The City of Nairobi (Kenya) has the world’s highest
per capita use of informal trans port with matatu mini -
buses providing 662 trips per inhabitant per year,
three-quarters of public trans port trips and 36 per
cent of trafﬁc volumes. In Harare, Zimbabwe, mini -
buses serve around 90 per cent of the market.86 In
Algiers (Algeria) the modal share for taxis and mini -
buses is 56 per cent of motorized trips,87 while in
Greater Cairo, Egypt, informal shared taxis increased
their modal share (of motorized trips) from 6 per cent
in 1987 to 37 per cent in 2001, and this has since
risen even higher.88

In Lagos (Nigeria) the public-sector bus company
failed under the weight of low fares and unsus tain -
able subsidies, its mobility role taken over by danfos,
midi-buses providing frequent and affordable services,
but  characterized  by  over crowding  and  aggressive
driving.89 A  fast  growing  informal  mode  is  motor-
cycle taxis, with 60,000 of them in Cotonou (Benin)
accounting for one-quarter of all trips.90 In Kampala,
Uganda,  residents  resort  to  boda  boda motorcycle
taxis, despite fares being four to six times higher than
regular taxis.91 The lower investments required from
opera tors  of  informal  trans port services  are  a  key
incentive for entry into this sector.

Formal public trans port is often absent in many
Asian cities. In Istanbul, Turkey, an estimated 5000
illegal taxis were in operation by the year 2000.92 In
Sana’a,  Yemen,  public  trans port is  almost  entirely
reliant on informally operated vehicles, often old and
poorly maintained, posing safety, health and conges -
tion challenges for the city.93 Mini buses and micro-
buses serve 5–10 per cent of all trips in Thailand and
Indonesia.  Informal  vehicles,  dominated  by  the
colourful jeepneys (converted US army jeeps) provide
as many as half of all trips in the Philippines.94 While
NMT serves short-distance trips in Jakarta, Indonesia,
motorcycle  taxis  (ojeks)  cover  longer  distances.
Hybrid,  three-wheeled  motor-taxis,  bajas,  provide
comfort  more  akin  to  a  private  car,  while  larger
three-wheeled bemos carry up to eight passen gers,
and mikrolets and mini buses carry 10 to 25 passen -
gers.95 The  rapid  expansion  in  auto-rickshaws  has
been observed in numerous Asian and African cities
in recent years (Box 2.4).

Informal  trans port  is  a  predominant  mode  in
most of Latin America, with the proliferation of vans
and mini buses fuelled by a lowering of import tariffs
and the inability of public trans port to meet trans -
port demand. A ﬂood of 10 to 15 passen ger vans in
the 1990s displaced pirate buses in Rio de Janeiro,
while  today  an  estimated  15,000  unlicensed  vans
operate in São Paulo.96 The use of unlicensed vans
in Brazil is also tied to perceived arduous and over -
reaching registration procedures. In Santiago, Chile,

Box 2.4 Auto-rickshaws: Taxis for the poor and middle class

An auto-rickshaw or three-wheeler (variously known as tuk-
tuk, trishaw, autorick, chakda, vikram, tempo, bajaj, tricycle, baby
taxi, etc.) is a popular way to get around in many devel op ing
countries. These motorized versions of the traditional
rickshaw ﬂourish in Bangladesh, Cambodia, Egypt, Ethiopia,
Guatemala, India, Laos, Pakistan, the Philippines, Sri Lanka,
Sudan and Thailand. In many Indian and Pakistani cities,
motorcycle rickshaws – usually called phat-phati, chand gari
(moon car) or qingqi (after the Chinese company) – also
populate city streets. In Afghanistan, auto-rickshaw use is

growing at 10 to 20 per cent per year in many cities. Auto-
rickshaws are also an important source of employment,
providing as much as 15 per cent of total urban jobs in some
Asian cities.

Because two-stroke engines that power most auto-

rickshaws are noisy and emit high levels of air emissions, local
govern ments in India and Pakistan have in recent years
required that older models be replaced by cleaner and quieter
three-wheelers, powered by compressed natural gas.
Sources: Cervero, 2000; Jain, 2011.

some 30,000 pirate taxis ply the streets. In Kingston,
Jamaica, private station-wagons (called robots) poach
customers from public operators by running ahead
of buses.97 In Mexico City, around half of the mini -
bus operators are not legitimately licensed or insured.
Smaller  door-to-door  carriers  concentrate  on  out-
lying markets, such as in Bogotá, Colombia, where
tricimobiles in peripheral informal settlements serve
short trips of 1–2 kilometres at low costs (less than
US$0.50 per trip).98 Because of rapid motorization,
however, informal carriers are increasingly viewed
as major contributors to worsening trafﬁc congestion.
Informal  trans port  operators  in  devel op ing
countries  serve  not  only  low-income  markets  but 
also  middle-income  choice  consumers  looking  for
convenience (e.g. door-to-door, taxi-like services).99
Low-income users also seek service quality, as in the
case of Uzbekistan, the Kyrgyz Republic and Brazilian
cities where surveys show that the poor are willing
to  pay  more  for  better  services.100 Further more,
there are notable gender and age differences in the
use of informal trans port in cities, with mini buses
catering  to  larger  volume,  longer  distance  trips,
generally serving male customers. Motorcycle taxis
often cater to a younger crowd. Nearly two-thirds of
the motorcycle-taxi passen gers in Bangkok, Thailand,
are aged 16–25 years.101

Generally, the role of informal trans port appears
to decline as cities in devel op ing countries become
wealthier. For instance, the market share of informal

trans port in nine cities in Sub-Saharan Africa shows
a  negative  correlation  with  local  GDP  per  capita
levels (Figure 2.9). This inverse relationship between
wealth and informal trans port can at times prompt
public  authorities  to  ban  them  in  the  hope  of
conveying a modern image.

Informal trans port services are nowhere near as
vertically  organized  as  formal  services.  Often,
individual owner-operators provide the service, and
the  sector  is  normally  held  together  in  a  loose
horizontal  fashion,  dependent  upon  inter-personal
and  inter-operator  linkages  and  fellowship  among
stakeholders (Box 2.5).

Some devel op ing countries attempt to regulate
market entry, vehicle and driver ﬁtness and service
practices  with  respect  to  informal  transport.  For
example, in Nairobi, Kenya, the Ministry of Transport
enforced  that  all  seats  be  ﬁtted  with  seatbelts  in 
mini buses, while standing is no longer permitted on
larger  buses.102 Red  plates  distinguish  the  55,000
legitimate  shared-ride  taxis  of  Beirut,  Lebanon,
although  around  40  per  cent  of  the  plates  are
forged.103 However, circumvention of such regula -
tions is widespread and enforcement is often ham -
pered.  Thus,  in  many  poorer  countries,  govern-
ments acquiesce to self-regulation and self-policing
of informal transport. Indeed, many informal oper -
ators  often  form  route  associations  to  minimize
collectively  damaging  behaviour  and  to  increase
ridership and proﬁts.

Informal transport
operators in
developing
countries serve
not only low-
income markets
but also middle-
income choice
consumers
looking for
convenience 
(e.g. door-to-door,
taxi-like services)

Generally, the
role of informal
transport appears
to decline as cities
in developing
countries become
wealthier

Box 2.5 Mini bus operators in Kampala (Uganda) and Nairobi (Kenya)

In Kampala and Nairobi, it is normal for mini bus owners to be
investors rather than owner-drivers. Most owners have less
than four vehicles. They usually hire out their mini buses for a
daily fee to a principal driver, who may in turn employ a
second driver and one or more conductors. The driver keeps
the revenue collected but is responsible for paying the costs of
fuel, use of the mini bus terminals, the wages of any second
driver and conductors, as well as any ﬁnes extorted from him
by the police or the route associations. Drivers work very

long hours, with shifts averaging more than 12 hours a day,
usually for six or seven days a week, although actual driving
hours are normally seven to eight hours. So as to maximize
the revenue from each trip, the mini bus driver will not
normally leave the terminal until the vehicle is full. This means
that at off-peak times vehicles wait very long times at the
terminal.

Deliberate 
re-regulation of
public transport
has . . . been
observed in some
developing
countries

Paratransit offers
distinct service
advantages, and in
most developing
countries – where
formal public
transport is
limited or non-
existent – it is
often the only
dependable
service available

Deliberate re-regulation of public trans port has
also  been  observed  in  some  devel op ing  countries.
Responding to faltering public bus services, the local
govern ment of Kingston, Jamaica, opened the market -
place to private service providers in the 1990s, only
to experi ence a deluge of illegal mini bus opera tors
who ﬂagrantly violated trafﬁc rules. A single govern -
ment-controlled  bus  company  was  conse quently
reintroduced, although illegal mini buses still persist.
In  Dakar,  Senegal,  re-regulation  similarly  followed 
the declining quality of private paratransit services.
With the help of overseas devel op ment assistance,
an organizing authority was created and resourced
to  upgrade  the  mini bus  ﬂeet  and  grant  tightly
controlled  concessions  to  private  companies.  In
Nairobi, Kenya, matatu mini buses are being phased
out in the central business district in favour of larger
vehicles (25 seats and more), operated by larger, more
closely regulated owner-driver ‘societies’.

Developed countries
Many cities of developed countries also have informal
trans port services,  often  as  niche  markets  for
immigrants from countries with a legacy of informal
transport. Some car-owning lower income families
also supplement their income by operating ‘under
the radar’.104 Unlicensed illegal limousine services

may poach unsuspecting visitors leaving airports. In
Miami and New York (US), informal services thrive
as trusted and familiar alternatives to city services,
particularly in areas with dense neigh bour hoods of
people  with  similar  cultural  backgrounds,  high 
levels of immigrants and non-native speakers. Over
5000 illegal vans and private cars are estimated to
roam  the  streets  of  Manhattan  and  Brooklyn.105
Other examples include the ‘black cabs’ of Belfast
(UK) and the ‘little Cuba cabs’ of Miami (US) oper -
ating  in  low-income  neigh bour hoods  ignored  and
sometimes redlined by authorized operators.

In Eastern Europe, informal trans port began to
play  an  increasingly  important  role  in  the  1990s,
following the disbanding and weakening of state-run
public trans port enterprises. For instance, in Tirana,
Albania,  ten-seat  minivans  called  furgons emerged 
as a key form of trans port in 1999, even surpassing
the  service  of  formal  buses  on  some  inner-city 
routes. Despite being banned from the inner city,
such trans port continues to play a major role in the
metropolitan region of Tirana, accounting for 14 per
cent of all trips.106

trans port is limited or non-existent – it is often the
only dependable service available. With fewer passen -
gers per vehicle, paratransit is more frequent, thereby
reducing waiting times and is also more ﬂexible and
adaptive  by  providing  door-to-door  service.  Small
vehicles are suited to lower density settings, serving
polycentric  trip  patterns,  functioning  as  comple-
ments to large-vehicle, trunk-line services. They also
penetrate the narrow streets of low-cost neigh bour -
hoods and better negotiate congested trafﬁc, and are
thus  faster,  often  offering  a  smoother  ride  and  a
guaranteed seat. Vehicles used for informal trans port
can also be more energy efﬁcient, owing to higher
load factors. In Abidjan, Côte d’Ivoire, mini buses use
an average of 12 per cent less fuel per passen ger trip
compared to conventional buses.107

The  greatest  appeal  of  paratransit  is  that  it  is
ﬁnan cially remunerative. Driven by proﬁt, operators
respond  quickly  to  market  trends  and  economize 
on  costs.  By  organizing  into  route  associations 
and co opera tives they can lower per-seat costs to the
point of being competitive with larger companies.108
Data  from  mini bus  operations  in  Abidjan  (Côte
d’Ivoire),  Dakar  (Senegal)  and  Douala  (Cameroon)
reveal  sizeable  proﬁt  margins,  fare-box  revenues
exceed ing operating costs by 17–96 per cent.109 In
Johannesburg (South Africa), the operating cost per
passen ger of formal public trans port is estimated to
be 13 times higher than informal transport.110

Importantly  also,  the  informal  sector  is  a
signiﬁcant  gateway  employment  for  many  recent
immigrants,  making  up  an  estimated  15  per  cent 
of  total  employment  in  poor  countries.  In  Dhaka,
Bangladesh, the ﬁgure is close to 30 per cent.111 In
Cotonou, Benin (with just under 1 million inhabit -
ants), motorcycle taxis alone provide 60,000 jobs,
mostly for young men.112 Indirect employment is also
signiﬁcant,  as  touts,  changers  (who  provide  small
change) and a cadre of individuals who clean, main -
tain,  repair  and  rebuild  informal  carriers.113 Most
motorcycle  taxi  operators  in  Bangkok  (Thai land),
Jakarta  (Indonesia)  and  Yola  (Nigeria)  are  rural
migrants with no previous urban employment.114

While playing a critical role for the mobility of
many urban residents, the informal trans port sector
faces  a  number  of  constraints.115 A  key  challenge
faced by operators relates to accessing commercial
lines  of  credit.  In  the  Caribbean  and  Sub-Saharan
Africa,  banks  are  reluctant  to  lend  to  informal
operators. If they do, interest rates are often high
(40 per cent or more per month) and payback periods
short (three years or less). Unable to obtain credit
through  formal  channels,  some  operators  turn  to
street lenders, paying most of their daily earnings to
creditors and rarely getting out of debt. Operators
that lease vehicles pay to vehicle owners, often half
or more of their daily in-take, meaning few are able
to break out of poverty.116

Safety is an additional challenge, with accidents
occurring because of poor (or lack of) driver train-
ing,  inappropriate  vehicles  and  poor  maintenance. 
In  Abidjan,  Côte  d’Ivoire,  mini buses  (ghakas)  are
involved  in  around  10  per  cent  of  accidents  and
shared  taxis  in  25  per  cent.  In  Yopougon,  Côte
d’Ivoire, shared taxis account for an estimated 90 per
cent  of  trafﬁc  accidents  and  nearly  all  associated
deaths in these accidents.117 In South Africa, more
than 2000 drivers, attendants and passen gers died
in  paratransit-related  violence  during  the  1990s,
according to ofﬁcial statistics.118 Informal operators
rarely insure vehicles (or passen gers), thus further
aggravating accident impacts.

In environ mental terms, paratransit vehicles are
signiﬁcant atmospheric polluters due to two-stroke
engines,  excessive  oil  mixtures,  low-grade  fuels 
and poorly maintained engines.119 In Cambodia and
Laos, tuk-tuk three-wheelers still rely on two-stroke
engines. In Thailand, most two-stroke engines have
been  converted  to  less  noisy  and  polluting  four-
stroke engines, some cities experimenting with solar
panel propulsion.120 In much of Sub-Saharan Africa,
motorcycle taxis emit from both two-stroke engines
and excessive use of oil lubricant in fuels.

Without  formal  oversight,  discrimination  and
harassment can be experi enced by informal trans port
users. In Malawi and South Africa, women report fear
of rape and high levels of verbal abuse.121 Expecta -
tions that women sit side-saddle on motorcycle taxis
can pose serious safety risks (Box 2.6). In the Middle
East,  cultural  restrictions  on  haggling  with  male
drivers means women often pay higher fares. Mini -
bus  routes  focusing  on  work  connections  rather 
than domestic journeys – along with paying at each
mode change – mean that Middle Eastern women
pay more than men.122 Young patrons are also vulner -
able. In Dar es Salaam (Tanzania), some dala dala mini -
buses  do  not  allow  children  to  board  during  rush
hours because govern ment concessionary fares are
seen as unproﬁtable.123

Corruption is frequently rife within the informal
trans port sector. Since most service providers are not
fully licensed they must often pay bribes. In Dakar,
Senegal, bribes to police ofﬁcers by mini bus drivers
comprise 5 per cent of total operating costs.124 In
Thailand, Bangkok’s win motorcycle taxi operators
complain of protection payments to police ofﬁcials
and military ofﬁcers.

Another consequence of weak regulatory control
is abuse of the labour market, seen through a dis -
regard for minimum salaries, age limits, work-hour
restrictions and insufﬁcient or absent insurance, etc.
Informal workers have few other employment options
and are often in debt to vehicle owners who set high
rents or provide high-interest loans.

Box 2.6 Gender differences in Nigerian motorcycle taxis

The worldwide economic recession and market liberalization
policies from the 1990s have weakened an already struggling
public trans port sector across Nigerian cities. Buses routinely
broke down, roads remained rutted and in very poor
condition and formal services never reached the rapidly
growing informal settlements on the urban fringes. Informal
motorcycle and tricycle auto-rickshaw operators stepped in to
ﬁll the gap.

While viewed as just temporary ﬁxes in the minds of

public authorities, slowly but surely they have become ﬁrmly
established as the backbone of Nigeria’s urban public trans port
system. Flexible and market-responsive yet still too expensive
for the poor, they predominantly serve more educated,
somewhat better-off residents. A recent study of four
intermediate-sized Nigerian cities showed that 85 per cent of
such motorcycle passen gers used the services four or more
times a week, with slightly more women than men relying on
such trans port on a daily basis.

Over 95 per cent of the women surveyed stated that

they adjusted their dress accordingly, compared to only 22 per
cent of the men. Moreover, 83 per cent of the men were
single passen gers compared to only 8 per cent of the women,
who frequently travelled with their infants and toddlers.
Motorcycle fatalities have sharply risen across all cities in West
Africa, including Nigeria. Records show that a higher number
of females than male passen gers were involved in three or
more accidents per year. Dress and social norms have played a
role in this; as women are expected to sit with two legs placed
to the left of the motorcycle, which exposes them directly to
trafﬁc and a risk of being thrown off at bends or roundabouts.
Children are equally vulnerable where they travel with women
under such circumstances.

PRIVATE MOTORIZED
TRANSPORT
The growth of private motorized trans port during the
twentieth century had major impacts on the growth
and devel op ment of cities all over the world. Pathways
once charted in developed countries are now being
followed in the rapidly growing cities of devel op ing
countries. This section reviews the global conditions
and trends in the use of private motorized vehicles,
and in the provision of infra struc ture for the same.
The  externalities  associated  with  private  motor
vehicles are considered while examining the advan -
tages of private motorization.

In 2010, there were 825 million passen ger cars
globally.  Of  these,  close  to  70  per  cent  were  in

developed  (including  transitional)  countries  while
only  30  per  cent  were  in  devel op ing  countries,
mainly in Asia (Table 2.3). The number of light-duty
motor vehicles – cars, SUVs, light trucks and mini-
vans – is projected to increase to nearly 1.6 billion
by 2035125 and more than 2.1 billion by 2050 (Figure
2.10). Africa had the lowest ownership rates, account -
ing for only 3 per cent of all passen ger cars globally.
Nevertheless, motorization growth rates are higher
in devel op ing countries, as discussed below.

Globally, the number of new cars sold annually
increased  from  39  million  in  the  1990s  to  nearly 
63 million in 2012.126 Asia has seen a steady rise in
new-car sales ﬁgures, from around 7 million in the
1990s to around 25 million in 2012, thereby becom -
ing the leader in new-car sales, accounting for 40

per cent of global sales in 2012 (Figure 2.11). The
rapidly growing economies of Asia and South America
are  expected  to  continue  driving  massive  future
growth in new-car sales. It should here be noted that
in  many  devel op ing  countries  the  bulk  of  newly
registered cars are not new, but rather second-hand
imports  from  developed  countries.127 Statistics  on
new-car sales are thus an unreliable basis for dis cus -
sions on motorization levels in these countries.

Developed countries
Car ownership began to emerge as a phenomenon
in the early twentieth century in the US, becoming
widely  available  to  the  middle  classes  after  1920, 
and by the 1950s car ownership levels had reached
an  average  of  one  car  per  household.128 This  was 
to have a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the spatial form of
cities,  allowing  urban  sprawl  and  facilitating  the
expansion  of  low-density  suburban  settlements  in
much of North America.129 Within the framework of
a govern ment drive to provide affordable housing,
land-use  dispersal  became  a  prominent  feature  of
urbanization in the US, accompanied by growing car
dependence.130 Increased  motorization  occurred 
in other developed countries much later, but given
higher  population  densities  in  Europe  and  Japan,

public trans port continued to play an important role.
Indeed, both distances travelled and the number of
trips by private car per capita are substantially lower
in European countries compared to the US.131

Since  1990,  vehicle  ownership  growth  rates
have  been  declining  in  a  number  of  European
countries such as Germany, France, Italy and also in
Japan.132 A non-linear relationship has been found
between the growth of vehicle ownership and per
capita  income  such  that  vehicle  ownership  grows
slowly at lower levels of per capita income, then faster
at middle and higher income levels reaching satura -
tion at the highest levels of income.133 In countries
with high car ownership there is evidence that travel
distances may have peaked, so that further increases
in  GDP  are  unlikely  to  lead  to  increased  travel
distances (Figure 2.12).134 Factors such as higher fuel
prices, an ageing population, improved travel options
and health and environ mental concerns contribute
to a growing demand for alternative modes of travel
in developed countries.135

In  countries  with  economies  in  transition  –
following  the  move  away  from  socialism  and 
related market liberalization – car ownership rates
doubled in just a decade (1990–2000). At the same
time, these countries have experi enced declining use
of public transport, particularly due to the removal

of  state  subsidies  and  disbanding  of  state-owned
operators.  Not  surprisingly  also,  suburban  sprawl
patterns  have  emerged  as  prominent  features  in
former socialist countries, representing a departure
from  the  formerly  densely  built-up  urban  centres
dependent on public transport.136

Variations  in  distances  travelled  by  motorized
vehicles in the US illustrate how speciﬁc urban forms
shape travel behaviour. In 2007, residents of low-
density  sprawling  cities  travelled  longer  distances, 
as  in  the  cases  of  Atlanta  (48  vehicle  kilometres 
per  capita  per  day),  Houston  (61  kilometres)  and
Jacksonville  (54  kilometres);  while  those  living  in
more compact cities travel shorter distances, such
as in New York (27 kilometres) and New Orleans 
(24 kilometres).137 The relationship between urban
form, land use patterns and private motorized travel
is elaborated in greater detail in Chapter 5 of this
report.

Devel op ing countries
The rate of motor vehicle ownership in devel op ing
countries remains signiﬁcantly lower than in devel -
oped  countries  (Table  2.3).  However,  ownership
levels are not indicative of the high rates of growth
in motor vehicle ownership in devel op ing countries.
The average annual motor vehicle ownership growth
rate in emerging economies is higher than that of
most developed countries. The levels of motorization
in rapidly emerging cities of devel op ing countries are
already higher than expected, given their lower GDPs
and their generally dense urban form.138 With most
of the current and future growth in population and
urbanization taking place in devel op ing countries, the

potential for further motorization is substantial.139
Motorized  two-wheelers  constitute  a  sizeable
proportion  of  motor  vehicles  in  devel op ing  coun-
tries, particularly in Asia where 75 per cent of the
world’s two-wheelers are located, out of which China
and India account for 50 per cent and 20 per cent,
respectively.140 It  has  been  estimated  that  there
were some 350 million two- and three-wheelers in
use  worldwide  in  2005  (Figure  2.10).  However, 
in many countries, this is the fastest increasing seg-
ment of personal transport. A recent report projects
that  total  sales  of  motorcycles  in  2013  alone  may
reach 114 million units, up from 39 million in 2003
and 79 million in 2008. The bulk of these, some 80
per cent are sold in Asian countries (55 per cent in
China alone), yet the fastest rates of increase in sales
are  reported  from  Africa  and  the  Middle  East.141
Thus, by 2050, the global stock of motorized two-
and three-wheelers is projected to reach about 850
million (Figure 2.10). Therefore, while the rate of
car ownership in many devel op ing countries in Asia
may be low (Table 2.3), the rate of motorization may
be much higher. In cities such as Ho Chi Minh City
(Viet Nam), Jakarta (Indonesia), Chennai and Mumbai
(India)  and  Guangzhou  and  Shanghai  (China)  the
number  of  motorcycles  per  capita  exceeds  that  of 
cars (Figure 2.13). The inclusion of two- and three-
wheelers  dramatically  alters  motorization  levels  in
Asian countries, raising them to levels comparable
to developed countries.142

The  rapid  and  often  unmanageable  growth  in 
the number of two- and three-wheelers has resulted
in the introduction of a number of govern ment meas -
ures to restrict their growth and operation in Asian
cities (Table 2.4). Even so – given their affordability,

fuel economy and manoeuvrability relative to private
cars, and amid restricted access to public trans port
–  two-  and  three-wheelers  are  likely  to  remain  a
popular option for lower and middle-income residents
of  Asian  cities.  In  contrast,  in  Latin  America  and
Africa, the number of motorcycles relative to cars
remains low. Although ownership rates for two- and
three-wheelers,  are  currently  quite  low  in  African
cities,  their  role  is  expected  to  increase  in  the
future.143

Infra struc ture for private motorized
transport
Globally, the provision of road space and parking for
vehicles varies considerably, partly reﬂecting different
strategies adopted by cities towards private motor-
ized travel (Table 2.5). In most cities of Africa and
Asia, there is less than 1 metre of road per person.
Latin American cities, such as Curitiba, Bogotá and
São Paulo have slightly more road length per person.
Even  so,  road  lengths  per  person  in  devel op ing-
country cities remain far lower than the average of
the US (6.5 metres per person) and Australia (8.1
metres per person). A key objective of urban trans -
port investments in many devel op ing countries has
thus  been  to  increase  road  space  for  motorized
transport.  Yet,  new  road  infra struc ture  tends  to
generate addi tional trafﬁc. There is a need to move

away from simply predicting growth in motorization
in  order  to  provide  additional  infra struc ture,  and
move  towards  demand  management  within  the
framework of an overall strategy for sus tain ability.
With  respect  to  parking  space,  cities  such  as
Bogotá  (Colombia),  Chennai  (India)  and  Shanghai
(China) have less than ten parking spots for every
1000  jobs  in  their  central  business  district  areas. 
In  contrast,  other  cities  such  as  Kuala  Lumpur
(Malaysia),  Bangkok  (Thailand)  and  Harare  (Zim -
babwe) have central business district parking spots
in  relation  to  jobs  comparable  to  those  of  richer 
cities in Canada and Western Europe. The extremes
are China at the low end and Riyadh (Saudi Arabia)
at the top end with more parking places than jobs
(Table 2.5).

The  availability  of  parking  is  critical  for
destination  accessibility  and  thus  an  important
determinant of modal choice in urban areas. Control
over available spaces, the length of availability and
the  costs  of  parking  can  thus  prove  effective  in
restricting private motor vehicle use if incorporated
in  the  overall  city-wide  trans port  strategy.144
Complementary trafﬁc enforcement policies may be
needed  to  ensure  informal  parking  does  not  take
place.145

In  developed  countries  too  the  provision  of 
road space is differentiated (Table 2.5). The highest
levels of road space per capita can be found in cities

in Australia, New Zealand, the US and Canada, all of
which have more than 5 metres of road per person.
Western  Europe  has  an  average  of  3  metres  of 
roads per person, while Eastern European countries
have even less. The availability of parking spots is also
much lower in Eastern Europe compared to other
developed  countries.  The  length  of  freeways  per
person  in  Western  Europe  is  almost  triple  that  of
Eastern  Europe.  On  the  whole,  provision  of  infra -
structure  for  private  motorized  trans port is  lower 
in  Europe  when  compared  to  North  America  and
Australia,  both  in  terms  of  road  length,  freeway
length and availability of parking spaces.

Impacts of private motorized transport
The  major  element  behind  the  growth  of  private
motorized trans port around the world has been the
individual freedom it offers, at a cost that is becoming
affordable  for  a  growing  number  of  people.  The
perceived  advantages  of  convenience,  privacy  and
status continue to make the private car an attractive
means of trans port in cities. Moreover, the private
motorized  trans port industry  generates  numerous
economic beneﬁts, including direct employment in
manufacturing,  indirect  employment  in  infra struc-
ture and services (fuel stations, maintenance, second-
hand  markets,  policing,  emergency  services)  and
major investments in urban areas (road construction).

Overall,  the  automotive  industry  supports  around 
5 per cent of the total global workforce.146 However,
a  considerable  range  of  externalities  arise  from
increased  motorization  in  cities.  Taken  together,
these dwarf the beneﬁts of this means of transport.
Being  heavily  dependent  on  oil,  one  of  the  most
signiﬁcant impacts of private motorized trans port is
on  the  environ ment.  Increased  use  of  private
motorized trans port also has impacts on health and
safety in cities.147

A further externality of private motorized trans -
port is trafﬁc congestion that imposes signiﬁcant costs
on economic efﬁciency as time lost due to congestion
reduces  productivity.  Congestion  costs  in  Canada 
are as high as US$4.5 billion148 nationally of which
80 per cent is accounted for by the country’s three
largest urban regions: Greater Toronto (43 per cent),
Montreal  (21  per  cent)  and  Vancouver  (17  per
cent).149 In the US, congestion has led urban Amer -
icans to travel 5.5 billion hours more and to purchase
an  extra  11  billion  litres  of  fuel  for  congestion-
related costs of US$121 billion in 2011.150 In 2005,
the  cost  of  congestion  in  Australia’s  eight  capital 
cities was US$7.1 billion,151 comprised of private time
costs (37 per cent), business time costs (38 per cent),
extra vehicle operating costs (13 per cent) and extra
air population (12 per cent).152 The immense eco -
nomic  impact  of  trafﬁc  congestion  is  further  illus -
trated by the case of Cairo, which costs Egypt as much
as 4 per cent of its GDP.153 In São Paulo, Brazil, some
of  the  wealthiest  residents  have  resorted  to  the
regular use of helicopters to beat trafﬁc jams.154

Access  to  motorized  trans port has  not  been
universal in cities, with gender, age, disability and
income having an impact. Also, in devel op ing coun -
tries, travel by private motorized trans port is reserved
for a small group of high-income (often male) earners,
and so its importance for women is comparatively
minor.155 However,  this  is  changing,  particularly 
in  emerging  economies  such  as  China,  India  and
Brazil, where middle-class women are increasingly
owning  and  driving  cars.  The  number  of  female
drivers in Russia, where car ownership functions as
an important status symbol, has increased by 50 per
cent from 2000 to 2006.156 Similar trends have been
observed  in  Mumbai,  India,  where  (with  women
earning higher incomes) traditional male-dominated
gender  roles  in  car  purchase  decisions  are  chang -
ing.157 Gender  differences  in  access  to  motorized
trans port in turn translate into differentiated access
to opportunities.

INTERMODALITY IN URBAN
TRANSPORT
The four modes of urban trans port discussed in this
chapter  are  highly  complementary  in  that  urban 

The State of Urban Passenger Transport

trips are often multi-modal, involving a combination
of more than one mode. Modal integration – or the
coordination  of  trans port  infra struc ture,  services,
facilities and spatial conﬁguration to enable seamless
links between at least two different modes, thereby
facilitating trip-chaining – is an essential prerequisite
for enabling multi-modal trips, and by implication also
urban  accessibility.  Strategies  that  facilitate  this
include spatial, network, fare, information and institu -
tional integration to allow smooth transfers between
different modes of urban transport.158 It is particularly
important to facilitate easy transfers between other
modes and public trans port if its modal share is to
increase.

The  critical  importance  of  intermodality  to
enable accessibility in cities is recognized, though
interventions designed to enhance integration vary
across  countries.  Cities  in  Western  Europe  have
taken  the  lead  in  facilitating  modal  integration,
especially between public and non-motorized trans -
port. Cycling signiﬁcantly increases the catchment
area of public trans port stops beyond walking range,
while access to public trans port makes longer trips
possible for bicyclists.159 In Germany, 70 bike stations
located at train stations enable bicyclists and public
trans port users to smoothly transition from one mode
to the other. In the city of Berlin alone 24,000 bike
parking  spaces  are  available  at  public  trans port
stations.160 All metro and express interurban train
stations on the peripheries of the city now have bike
parking facilities. Guarded facilities for storing bikes
together with complementary services (maintenance
and repair) are available at all main train stations in
the Netherlands, where 35 per cent of train users
use a bike to get to and from train stations.161 In the
UK, train travellers are able to buy a discount bus
ticket (PLUSBUS) that enables seamless transfer to
buses.162

North  American  cities  have,  to  some  degree, 
also witnessed an increase in facilities designed to
integrate cycling and public trans port services, with
bike  parking  spaces  increasing  by  67  per  cent  in
Canada  and  26  per  cent  in  the  US  between 
2006 and 2008. Noteworthy examples include the
San Francisco Bay Area – where the Bay Area Rapid
Transit  (BART)  system  has  bike  parking  in  almost 
all 43 stations – and Vancouver – where integration
between public trans port and bicycles is facilitated
by  TransLink.  TransLink,  Vancouver’s  multi-modal
transportation authority, has spent more than US$12
million  on  such  integration  between  1999  and
2009.163

Modal  integration  has  been  given  minimal
deliberate  consideration  in  devel op ing-country 
cities.  Yet,  although  not  by  design,  informal  and 
non-motorized modes do serve as an important gap
ﬁller by feeding other modes of transport. Mexico

Cities remain

large numbers of
urban residents in
spatial/physical or
socioeconomic
terms

In the absence of
accessible public
transport services,
informal transport
remains
predominant in
developing
countries 

substituting,  without  subsidies,  the  failing  public
bus system.

Some  notable  achievements  in  modal  integra-
tion are emerging in Asian and Latin American cities.
In China, Guangzhou’s BRT system – which serves
800,000  passen gers  daily  –  is  integrated  with  the
city’s  bike  lanes  and  bike  share  system,  greatly
enhancing  physical  access  to  public  trans port
services.164 The cities of São Paulo, Curitiba (both in
Brazil), Bogotá (Colombia) and Santiago (Chile) have
all  taken  action  to  advance  integration  between
public and non-motorized transport.165

Many of the attempts to facilitate intermodality
between non-motorized and public trans port in cities
to date have focused on integrating cycling. Yet, the
contribution of walking as a feeder to public trans -
port systems has also been emphasized.166 This also
applies to devel op ing countries, where most public
trans port trips involve walking at both ends of the trip.
An analysis of access trips for Delhi Metro (India), for
instance, found that often between 40 and 60 per
cent of the passen gers walk to the stations.167

CONCLUDING REMARKS
AND LESSONS FOR POLICY
‘Accessibility’ may be the ‘holy grail’ for the twenty-
ﬁrst  century  city.  Yet,  the  trans port  trends  and
conditions  outlined  in  this  chapter  indicate  that
cities remain inaccessible for large numbers of urban
residents in spatial/physical or socioeconomic terms.
In  turn,  such  limitations  restrict  access  to  oppor -
tunities for urban dwellers, with implications for their
overall wellbeing and progress.

Public trans port offers the greatest potential to
enhance accessibility in cities, but is non-existent or
declining in most devel op ing countries, and increases
in developed countries are not commensurate with
the scale required to meet sus tain ability targets. A
new  business  model  for  funding  public  trans port
needs  to  be  forged.  Public  trans port  must  always
remain affordable but a new commercial paradigm
is needed that allows the social dimension of pro -
viding  a  public  service  to  be  combined  with
efﬁciencies and commercial acumen to improve cost
recovery. Moving from captive riders (passen gers) to
clients and choice riders, making public trans port a
lifestyle choice, requires a strong customer focus.
Despite  the  multiple  beneﬁts  it  generates  for
both  users  and  society  as  a  whole,  NMT  is  often
marginalized and receives minimal priority in urban
mobility planning and investments, both in developed
and devel op ing countries. It constitutes the principal
and often only accessible means of trans port for the
majority  of  residents  in  devel op ing-country  cities
with most who opt for this mode doing so out of a
lack of choice. Yet, in most cities, NMT conditions

are extremely hostile. Investing in NMT to enhance
the  safety  and  security  of  walking  and  cycling
constitutes a key pillar of planning and design for
accessible mobility in cities. Innovative experi ences
from both developed and devel op ing-country cities
that have elevated NMT as a foundation for urban
sus tain ability  offer  valuable  insights  to  inform
planning and investments elsewhere.

Perhaps one of the most alarming trends – which
gravely threatens urban accessibility – is the steady
increase in the share of private motorized transport.
Almost 60 years after the private car became ﬁrmly
ﬁxed as the icon of the twentieth century, devel op -
ing  countries  are  experiencing  extremely  high
motorization  rates  further  supported  by  policies,
actions and investments that favour private motorized
over  non-motorized  and  public  trans port modes.
While  motorization  rates  have  generally  reached
saturation levels in developed countries, many of their
cities continue to bear the consequences of urban
and  trans port  planning  and  land-use  policies  that
facilitated car dependency and urban sprawl. While
it  does  perform  a  necessary  function  within  the 
over all arena of urban transport, where it dominates,
the externalities of private motorized trans port com -
promise the fundamental sus tain ability imperatives
in cities. Addressing the broader welfare concerns
around  equal  access  to  mobility  thus  necessitates
action to enable shifts to more sus tain able modes
through deliberate and targeted policies and invest -
ments.

In  the  absence  of  accessible  public  trans port
services, informal trans port remains predominant in
devel op ing countries and constitutes the main means
of motorized trips for most urban dwellers. Although
it provides essential beneﬁts to the urban poor in
terms of mobility and livelihoods, informal trans port
generates a number of environ mental and economic
externalities. A signiﬁcant challenge is to balance the
efﬁciency  and  social  equity  aspects  of  informal
transport, i.e. to achieve the social beneﬁts of free-
market services without exceeding social costs. The
sector would beneﬁt immensely from best-practice
examples of successful regulation of service quality
and  safety  while  at  the  same  time  allowing  the
inherent  advantages  of  private  competition  and
entrepreneurship to ﬂourish.

Given  the  current  state  of  urban  trans port
globally,  improved  urban  accessibility  requires
focusing on a number of vital pillars. Increasing the
modal  share  of  public  trans port is  a  universally
applicable strategy that has signiﬁcant potential to
address mobility challenges of both developed and
devel op ing countries. The role of high-capacity public
trans port systems in this respect is underscored in
Chapter 3 of this report and the social, environ mental
and economic sus tain ability beneﬁts of public trans -
port are featured in Chapters 6, 7 and 8. Efforts to

The State of Urban Passenger Transport

37

enhance urban accessibility are best not limited to
mode-speciﬁc interventions and investments. There
is abounding evidence indicating that intermodality,
or  the  integration  of  infra struc ture  and  services
across modes, to facilitate trip-chaining and multi-
modal trips, is a vital precondition for accessibility.
Urban  planning  and  design  principles  that  offer
potential for this are elaborated in greater detail in
Chapter 5. Effective institutional, regulatory and

policy  frameworks are  also  indispensable  to
facilitate urban, land-use and trans port planning in
an integrated manner that encourages shifts towards
more sus tain able modes of transport, as is discussed
in  Chapter  9.  Finally,  accessible  mobility  in  cities
cannot be considered in isolation from the move -
ment of goods in urban areas that consumes signiﬁ -
cant space and interacts with passen ger trans port at
times in adverse ways, as accentuated in Chapter 4.

METRO, LIGHT RAIL 
AND BRT

This chapter reviews the global conditions, trends and
challenges  for  the  main  high-capacity  trans port
options: metro, light rail and BRT. Such public trans -
port modes  offer  solutions  for  improving  urban
mobility, quality of life and the environ ment in both
developed  and  devel op ing  countries,  providing  a
competitive alternative to private motor vehicles. An
efﬁcient system facilitates seamless movement within
and  between  cities,  which  in  turn  is  essential  for
urban functionality and prosperity.1 Metros, light rail
and BRTs are suitable for key corridors in cities and
as part of larger, integrated public trans port systems.
High-capacity  public  trans port systems  are
strategic in shaping urban form, promoting higher
densities as well as mixed and accessible land use.
Such  modes  reduce  the  need  for  trips  by  private
motorized  travel,  and  may  thus  reduce  the  total
kilometres travelled in cars and motorcycles, miti -
gating negative externalities such as air pollution, road
trafﬁc accidents, lack of physical activity, noise and
greenhouse gas emissions. They are also important
in providing inclusive access for vulnerable and low-
income groups, and in creating jobs.

In the urban planning dialogue, opinions regard -
ing  metro,  light  rail  and  BRT  are  diversiﬁed,  with
arguments in favour of and against each mode.2 In
this chapter, these three modes are explored, demon -
strating  the  importance  of  undertaking  compre -
hensive  evaluations  that  consider  all  signiﬁcant
beneﬁts and costs of high-capacity public trans port
systems, prior to implementation. The chapter also
presents an overview of current global conditions and
trends, including some challenges: service quality,
integration,  ﬁnance  and  institutions.  The  chapter
concludes with key policy recommendations.

MAIN CHARACTERISTICS
OF METRO, LIGHT RAIL AND
BRT SYSTEMS
Metro, light rail and BRT are all intended to provide
fast, comfortable and cost-effective urban mobility

in medium- to high-demand corridors. These modes
of public transport, which use speciﬁc ﬁxed or exclu -
sive and separated tracks, have superior operating
capacity and performance compared to unsegregated
road-based  trans port  such  as  buses,  taxis  and
paratransit.3 In principle, the introduction of metro,
light rail and/or BRT can produce important beneﬁts
to a city: it can improve the efﬁciency of the urban
economy  by  reducing  travel  cost  and  time;  it  can
increase  the  level  of  city-centre  activity,  thereby
enhancing agglomeration economies that are crucial
for the prosperity of urban areas; and it can reduce
road congestion, which would then provide various
other economic and environ mental beneﬁts. In cities
where these modes are dominant, they improve the
access  to  opportunities  and  services,  and  may  be
beneﬁcial to the urban poor in a number of ways.4

Metro
Metro is an urban electric trans port system using rail
tracks, exhibiting high capacity and a high frequency
of service.5 Independent from other vehicles, roads
or  pedestrian  trafﬁc,  metros  are  designed  for
operations using tunnels, viaducts or at surface levels,
but with physically separated infra struc ture. In some
parts of the world, the metro system is also known
as underground, tube, subway, rapid rail or metro -
politan  railway.6 With  metros,  carrying  capacity  of
more than 30,000 passen gers per hour per direction
is possible.7 Globally, metros have evolved as a major
form of public transport, since the ﬁrst underground
railway opened in London in 1863.8 Although metro
systems are the most expensive urban public trans -
port option,  their  high  capacity  and  best  perform-
ance (in terms of speed and number of passen gers
con veyed),  make  them  invaluable  parts  of  highly
developed  trans port  systems.  Accordingly,  metro
systems  require  huge  investments  and  are  often
implemented as the preferred option of large cities
where demand justiﬁes that high capital cost.9

The general term
‘light rail’ covers
those systems
whose role and
performance lie
between a
conventional bus
service and a
metro

Table 3.1 
Main physical
characteristics of
metro, light rail and
BRT

Planning and Design for Sustainable Urban Mobility

Light rail
Light rail can be described as an electric rail-borne
transport, and can be developed in stages to increase
capacity  and  speed.10 Through  the  provision  of
exclusive right-of-way lanes, light rail systems typically
operate at the surface level with overhead electrical
connectors,  and  may  have  high  or  low  platform
loading  and  multi-  or  single-car  trains.11 Often,
segregation is introduced, or priority given to light
rail  at  road  junctions,  in  order  to  increase  speed 
and service reliability. The general term ‘light rail’
covers those systems whose role and performance
lie between a conventional bus service and a metro.12
Light rail systems are therefore ﬂexible and expand -
able. Historically, light rail systems evolved from the
‘streetcars’, ‘trolleycars’ or ‘tramways’ that started in
the second half of the nineteenth century as horse-
driven carts. With the advent of electricity, tramways
became very popular around 1900 and most large
cities in developed countries, as well as a few cities
in devel op ing countries, had tram systems. After the
Second World War, many trams were removed from
cities,  although  many  were  later  modernized  and
reintroduced in the last part of the twentieth century,
as an intermediate, ﬂexible, lower cost public trans -
port mode. Given the relatively high cost of light rail
systems, they are often found in wealthy cities and
in proximity to high-income devel op ments.13

Bus rapid transit
BRT is a bus-based mode of public trans port operating
on exclusive right-of-way lanes at the surface level,
although, in some cases, underpasses or tunnels are
utilized to provide grade separation at intersections
in dense city centres.14 The term ‘BRT’ was initially
coined in the US15 and the ﬁrst wide-scale devel op -
ment of BRT was implemented in Curitiba, Brazil, 
in 1982.16 Other names for BRT are ‘high-capacity
bus system’, ‘high-quality bus system’, ‘metro-bus’,
‘surface metro’, ‘express bus system’ and ‘busway
system’.17 While the terms may vary from country to
country, the basic premise is followed: a high-quality
customer-oriented public trans port that is fast, safe,
comfortable,  reliable  and  cost-effective.  The  best
BRT systems ﬂexibly combine stations, bus services,
busways  and  information  technologies  into  an
integrated system with a strong identity.18 Depending
on the speciﬁc system design, BRT capital costs are
4–20 times lower than light rail systems, and 10–100
times lower than metro systems, with similar capacity
and service level.19

Planning and Design for Sustainable Urban Mobility

Metro and light rail systems produce little noise, have
low emissions of air pollutants (including greenhouse
gases) and have high reliability. In addition, metro
systems do not use limited road space on the surface,
thus ensuring a consistently reliable and high-quality
service. Nevertheless, metro and light rail systems
have  limited  ﬂexibility  and  require  bus  or  inter -
mediate  public  trans port feeder  services  for  last-
kilometre  connectivity.  Further more,  the  distance
between stations is usually higher in metros than in
light rail and BRT in order to enable higher travel
speeds.  While  this  speeds  up  long  distance  com -
mutes, it also requires longer distances for passen -
gers to access stations.

The  key  variables  for  evaluating  high-capacity
public trans port systems include capacity, commercial
speed and cost. Figure 3.1 indicates that BRT can
provide  high-capacity  services  –  similar  to  that  of
metros and higher than that of light rail systems –
at a fraction of their capital costs.20 While commercial
speeds delivered by BRT and light rail systems are
usually lower than metros, some BRT systems reach
signiﬁcantly higher speeds than light rail (when using
express  services  or  fully  separated  facilities  in
expressways). It is also important to note that while
elevated  and  underground  metro  systems  average
similar capacities, their initial costs of construction
vary greatly (Figure 3.1). A more detailed discussion
of construction and operating costs for the various
trans port modes can be found in Chapter 8.

EXAMPLES OF NATIONAL
POLICIES TOWARD HIGH-
CAPACITY PUBLIC TRANS -
PORT IN DEVEL OP ING
COUNTRIES
Rail-based  public  trans port systems  have  been  a
natural  part  of  the  devel op ment  of  urban  infra -
structure  in  developed  countries’  cities.  However,
cities  in  devel op ing  countries  have  struggled  in 
this respect due to ﬁnan cial and institutional limi-
tations. Nevertheless, in the last 15 years, several
devel op ing-country cities have started implementing
BRT systems, and some have initiated or expanded
light rail and metros. Further more, national govern -
ments  are  co-ﬁnancing  public  trans port infra struc-
ture in order to support the large proportion of the
popu lation now living in urban areas, including con -
siderations of energy security, economic efﬁciency
and climate change. This section provides examples
from  selected  devel op ing  countries  that  have
introduced national policies to support high-capacity
urban public trans port systems.

China
In  2011,  the  Govern ment  of  China,  through  the
Ministry of Transport, introduced the ‘public trans -
port city’ project to improve the service level of urban
public  trans port and  alleviate  trafﬁc  congestion  in
Chinese cities. Supported by the Ministry of Trans -
port,  the  demonstration  projects  (in  30  selected
cities) will include the construction of public trans -
port hubs, implementation of ‘intelligent trans port
systems’, energy conservation and emission reduction
practices  in  public  transport.  Additional  ﬁnan cial
support  for  the  demonstration  projects  will  be
provided  at  the  national  level  and  co-ﬁnanced  by
provincial govern ments.

As  a  result  of  the  national  support,  several
Chinese  cities  have  started  the  construction  or
expanded  their  public  trans port networks  in  the
form of metro, light rail and BRT systems. Beijing,
for instance, is implementing a very ambitious rail
expansion programme. In 2012, the Beijing metro
had  16  lines,  with  442  kilometres  of  track  length 
and 251 stations, becoming the longest metro net -
work  in  the  world.21 Expansion  plans  call  for  708 
kilo metres of track in operation by 2015 and 1050
kilometres by 2020.

A  number  of  other  Chinese  cities  are  also
expanding their metro systems, namely: Hong Kong,
Tianjin,  Shanghai,  Guangzhou,  Dalian,  Wuhan,
Shenzhen, Chongqing, Nanjing, Shenyang, Chengdu,
Guangfo, Xi’an, Suzhou, Kunming and Hangzhou. In
addition, there are currently 18 cities with metro and
light rail systems under construction, and a further
22 cities where construction is either being planned
or pending approval. With respect to BRT, a total of
15  Chinese  cities  had  operational  systems,  while
another 11 systems were either under construction
or at the planning stage by 2012.

India
In 2005, the Govern ment of India created the US$20
billion  Jawaharlal  Nehru  National  Urban  Renewal
Mission  (JnNURM)  to  fund  urban  infra struc ture
improvements and basic services to the urban poor
in  65  cities  for  the  2005–2011  period.22 It  is
expected  that  the  programme  will  be  renewed  in
2013, as part of the sixth ﬁve-year plan.

With ﬁnan cial and technical assistance from the
national, state and local govern ments, the cities of
Kolkata, Chennai, Delhi and Bangalore currently have
operational  metro  systems.  Encouraged  by  Delhi’s
success, six other Indian cities have metro systems
under construction, while metro systems in another
eleven cities are in various planning stages. In Delhi,
where metro operations commenced in 2002, there
are currently 193 kilometres of metro tracks (with
145 stations). Expansion plans include another 140
kilometres (approved) and 139 kilometres (proposed)

for a total network of 472 kilometres to be completed
by 2021.23

In addition to the various metro systems under
construction, busways exist in Delhi, Pune and Jaipur,
while Ahmedabad has a fully operational BRT system
(75 kilometres long, with additional 80 kilometres
under construction or being planned). Further more,
BRT systems are currently being introduced in the
cities  of  Rajkot,  Surat,  Indore,  Hyderabad,  Pimpri-
Chinchwad, Visakapatnam and Bhopal. Another eight
cities are planning the introduction of BRT systems.

Brazil
The  Govern ment  of  Brazil  is  responsible  for  pro -
moting improvements in public urban transport. As
a result, every city with more than 20,000 inhab itants
(i.e.  some  1600  cities)  is  required  to  develop a
mobility master plan linked to its urban devel op ment
plans. The National Policy on Urban Mobility gives
priority  to  non-motorized  trans port and  public
transportation, over private motorized transport. It
also seeks to limit or restrict motor vehicle use in a
given geographic area or during a speciﬁc time period.
Other measures sought by the policy to reduce trafﬁc
congestion  and  air  pollution  include  establishing
congestion and pollution tolls, as well as emission
standards for air pollutants.

To support investment in public transport, the
federal govern ment created two programmes ‘Pro-
transporte’ and ‘Growth Acceleration Programme’,
in  preparation  for  the  2014  FIFA  World  Cup  and 
the 2016 Summer Olympic Games. Projects include
BRT lanes in 9 of the 12 cities that will host World
Cup  matches,  including  Rio  de  Janeiro  and  Belo
Horizonte.  In  four  cities,  including  São  Paulo  and
Brasília,  light  rail  systems  such  as  monorails  and
trams are being built, with another ﬁve cities planning
the adoption of the same. Currently, there are eight
cities  with  metro:  Belo  Horizonte,  Brasília,  Porto
Alegre, Fortaleza, Recife, Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo
and Teresina.

Inspired  by  the  bus  lanes  implemented  in
Curitiba in the 1970s, 31 cities in Brazil currently
have  BRT  systems  or  bus  ways,  totalling  696  kilo -
metres. Most of the already existing busway corridors
in Brazil need renovation and the BRT systems offer
the opportunity of increasing public trans port produc -
tivity, while overcoming the problems generated by
the multiple superimposed radial routes, converging
to terminals located at city centres. Several cities –
including  Belo  Horizonte,  Porto  Alegre,  Salvador,
Brasília and Belém – are currently upgrading some
sections of existing busways to BRT standards.

Mexico
In  2008,  the  Govern ment  of  Mexico  created  the
PROTRAM (Federal Support Programme for Public
Transport), to improve urban trans port efﬁciency and
to reduce urban greenhouse gas emissions. To date,
PROTRAM  has  given  ﬁnan cial  support  to  11  BRT
systems and 1 suburban rail system. Other pipeline
projects in 34 cities are earmarked for funding from
this  programme,  which  provides  both  grants  and
credits.

Mexico has a metro system in its capital Mexico
City; light rail systems in Guadalajara and Monterrey;
and BRT systems in León, Mexico City, Guadalajara,
Ecatepec and Monterrey.

Kenya
In  2009,  the  Govern ment  of  Kenya  launched  the
Integrated  National  Transport  Policy,  which  seeks 
to establish appropriate institutional and regulatory
frameworks  to  coordinate  and  harmonize  the
management  and  provision  of  passen ger  trans port
services. Among the policy recommendations is the
establishment of independent institutions to manage
urban passen ger trans port services and operations.24
The policy further envisions increasing use of
high-capacity public trans port through the provision
of railway infra struc ture for Nairobi and its environs.
Consequently, the govern ment opened the Syokimau
Railway station in the suburbs of Nairobi in 2012.
The  railway  service  from  this  station  to  the  city
centre has reduced travel time by half over the 18-
kilometre  journey.  Further more,  authorities  have
also ensured that the railway is integrated with other
modes, as last-mile link buses have been introduced
to boost the city commuter train service.25

The trans port policy also envisages the provision
of infra struc ture to support public trans port services,
i.e. bus lanes, promotion (through ﬁscal incentives)
of high-occupancy public trans port vehicles and dis -
couraging private motor vehicle use once the public
trans port system is efﬁcient.26 In 2012, the Govern -
ment  of  Kenya,  supported  by  the  World  Bank,
launched the National Urban Transport Improvement
Project  (NUTRIP)  to  support  the  devel op ment  of
selected high-capacity public trans port corridors.27

Morocco
The  Govern ment  of  Morocco  has  embarked  on
reforming  the  trans port  sector  along  three  main
pillars: improving the sector’s governance; improving
the  efﬁciency  and  devel op ing  the  supply  of  urban
trans port services and infra struc ture; and improving
the environ mental and social sus tain ability of urban
transport.28 Signiﬁcant investments have been made
towards light rail systems in the cities of Casablanca
and Rabat-Salé. Commissioned in 2011, the tramway

line between Rabat and Salé consists of 44 trams,
with an expected daily ridership of 180,000 passen -
gers. The total length of the dual-line tramway net -
work is 19.5 kilometres and consists of 31 stations
that are spaced a half kilometre apart.29

In  Casablanca,  the  tramway  devel op ment
company acquired 74 trams for the 31 kilometres 
Y-shaped network, which commenced operations in
2012. The line has 48 stops and has an expected daily
ridership of 255,000 passen gers.30

Nigeria
Nigeria’s  2010  National  Transport  Policy seeks  to
develop an efﬁcient, self-sustaining and reliable public
trans port system, and to improve the infra struc ture
and  institutional  framework  for  public  trans port
service delivery. It also aims to enhance the capacity
of the existing infra struc ture through proper main -
tenance of roadways and efﬁcient trafﬁc management.
Further more, it calls for the substantial expansion
of  urban  infra struc ture,  with  emphasis  on  public
trans port infra struc ture  –  railway,  dedicated  bus
routes, etc.31

The policy envisions the introduction of a high-
capacity  bus-based  trans port  system  that  can  be
accommodated by the existing infra struc ture. Already
there are dedicated bus routes in Lagos, where a BRT
is  being  implemented.  The  policy  also  aims  to
promote private sector participation in urban public
trans port services  and  in  the  long-term  introduce
rapid rail systems into the country’s major cities.

To  advance  the  efﬁciency  of  urban  trans port
system operations and management, an autonomous
body – the Municipal Transportation Agency – will
be established in each major city. The task of these
agencies will be, inter alia, the regulation, planning,
designing and maintenance of urban trans port infra -
struc ture facilities.

South Africa
In South Africa, the Public Transport Strategy aims
to  improve  public  trans port by  establishing  an
integrated  rapid  public  trans port network  that
comprises of an integrated package of rapid rail and
road corridors. Through BRT, the govern ment aims
to link different parts of a city into a network and
ensure that by 2020, most city residents are no more
than 500 metres away from a BRT station.32 The BRT
systems  are  being  implemented  through  public–
private  partnerships,  whereby  cities  build  and
maintain the infra struc ture for the operation of the
buses, stations, depots, control centres and a fare
collection  system.  Private  operators,  by  contrast,
own and manage the buses, hire staff and provide
services on a long-term contract.

In  Johannesburg,  the  Rea  Vaya  BRT  is  being
implemented in phases across in the city since 2009.

Notably, the ﬁrst trunk route running between Ellis
Park in Doornfontein and Thokoza Park in Soweto
has been completed. The long-term plan is for the
Rea  Vaya  route  to  cover  330  kilometres,  allowing
more than 80 per cent of Johannesburg’s residents
to catch a bus within 500 metres from a BRT station.33
In  addition  to  Johannesburg’s  BRT  system,  Cape
Town  also  has  a  BRT  system  known  as  MyCiTi,34
while Tshwane is implementing Tshwane BRT that
will cover some 80 kilometres of bus lines.35

The  Gauteng  Provincial  Govern ment  has
implemented Gautrain, which is South Africa’s ﬁrst
high-speed  passen ger  railway  line,  connecting  OR
Tambo  International  Airport  with  the  cities  of
Johannesburg and Pretoria. The 80-kilometre high-
speed passen ger railway network comprises of two
routes: the north–south line connecting Pretoria and
Hatﬁeld Johannesburg; and an east–west line from
Sandton  to  the  airport,  which  is  supported  by  a
network  of  feeder  buses  serving  most  of  its  ten
stations.

METRO SYSTEMS AROUND
THE WORLD: TRENDS AND
CONDITIONS
Due  to  govern ment  stimulus  programmes  in  the
wake of the global ﬁnan cial crisis, the world market
for railway infra struc ture and equipment has been
growing at 3.2 per cent a year, and is set to grow at
around 2.7 per cent annually until 2017. Spending
on  metro  rail  systems  should  grow  faster  still,  at
perhaps 6–8 per cent.36 Figure 3.2 shows the growth
of metro rail systems around the world in terms of
the  number  of  cities  with  operational  systems.37
By 1970, there were a total of 40 cities worldwide
with  metro  systems,  followed  by  a  rapid  increase
during the next four decades. Currently, there are
187 cities with a metro system as part of their public
trans port system.38 Box  3.1  provides  an  overview 
of the growth of metros across the world. The rapid
increase in the number of rail-based systems is an
indication of the importance of metros in facilitating
mobility,  particularly  in  large  urban  areas  that  are
beyond city limits. Notably, metros are less prone to
congestion than roadways and are important to those
residing in peripheral locations, as they commute long
distances to employment centres and other activity
nodes.39

The  global  distribution  of  metro  systems  in
Figure  3.3  shows  a  concentration  of  metros  in
Europe,  Eastern  Asia  and  the  eastern  part  of  the 
US. The regional distribution in terms of number of
cities and ridership is presented in Table 3.3. Asian
cities account for the largest share of metro ridership,
totalling more than 51 million riders a day. In terms
of total track length of metros, Asian cities account

Box 3.1  The growth of metros around the world

The building of metro systems accelerated from the 1960s,
mainly in reaction to the growth of sprawling mega-
metropolises around the world. Currently, 187 cities have
metros, with more to come amid a fresh spurt of construction
in devel op ing countries. In 2012, the Chinese cities of Suzhou,
Kunming and Hangzhou opened their metros, as did the city of
Lima in Peru. In 2011, Algiers (Algeria) was the second African
capital to launch a metro system.

Whereas China’s investment in high-speed intercity

railways is tailing off, evidence suggests that it is still pumping
money into metros. So is India: Bangalore’s metro was
launched in 2011, which will soon be followed by Mumbai.
Smaller cities, such as Bhopal and Jaipur, have plans on the
drawing-board. Brazil is expanding metro systems in its two
main cities, Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo, while building new
ones in smaller cities such as Salvador and Cuiabá.

Metros are being built in various smaller cities, such as in

Dubai, where the world’s longest driverless metro (75
kilometres) became operational in 2009; followed by Mecca’s
in 2010. Abu Dhabi, Doha, Bahrain, Riyadh and Kuwait City
have plans in progress. Other cities planning to build metros
include Asunción in Paraguay and Kathmandu in Nepal.

Many congested cities in devel op ing countries have spent

years planning metro systems. However, very little progress
has been made towards implementation. A prime example is
Algeria’s 1991–2002 civil war that accounts for the long
gestation period of its capital’s metro. In other cases, sluggish
(and sometimes corrupt) bureaucracies are the main obstacle.
In 2008, Indonesia’s trafﬁc-choked capital, Jakarta, abandoned
its attempt to build a monorail and built a successful busway as
a stopgap instead. Since then, the city’s governor has promised
to commence work on an underground metro.

for 41 per cent. European cities also depend heavily
on metro systems for urban mobility, accounting for
more than 38 million daily riders or 34 per cent of
global  ridership,  and  35  per  cent  of  global  track
length.  This  is  followed  by  Latin  America  and  the
Caribbean,  as  well  as  North  American  cities  that
account for 11.5 per cent and 8.6 per cent of the
world’s metro ridership, respectively. The two African
cities that have metros – Algiers and Cairo – have a

daily ridership of 2.2 million passen gers or 2 per cent
of global ridership.

Table 3.4 lists the world’s major metro systems
– i.e. those with an average daily ridership of more
than 2 million passen gers per day. Six of these 16
systems are in cities in devel op ing countries, while
the  rest  are  in  developed  countries.  The  world’s
largest or most used metro systems are Tokyo (Japan),
Seoul (Republic of Korea) and Beijing (China) with

(China) with 
8.5 million, 6.9
million and 6.7
million passengers
per day,
respectively

8.5 million, 6.9 million and 6.7 million passen gers
per day, respectively. In Tokyo, Japan, the modal share
of public trans port is nearly 80 per cent of all motor -
ized trips, with the metro accounting for a signiﬁcant
proportion.40 In  Shanghai,  China,  top  priority  has
been  given  to  the  extension  of  the  city’s  subway 
with the opening of six additional lines in 2010, and
a  planned  four-fold  increase  of  the  current  423
kilometres of track length by 2020.41 In 2007, the
city’s metro accounted for 13 per cent of its total
public transport; and with further investment this was
expected to increase to 45 per cent by 2012, thus
reducing the dependence on private cars.

Several  devel op ing-country  cities,  particularly
in  China,  have  been  able  to  expand  their  metro
networks in a short time. For instance, Beijing, which
has one of the two most developed subway systems
in China, has the highest use of public trans port in
the country.42 Since 2005, Beijing has allocated 30
per  cent  of  its  public  construction  budget  to  its

public trans port system, including its metro. Whereas
Beijing’s public trans port system is strong by Chinese
standards,  its  citizens  do  not  utilize  public  trans -
portation as much as the residents of other cities,
such as Seoul (Republic of Korea) and Tokyo (Japan).
As a result, the emission of air pollutants from mobile
sources remains one of the govern ment’s most urgent
challenges.

Since its launch in 1987, the metro system in
Cairo, Egypt, has gradually been expanded and the
total  track  length  now  measures  90  kilometres.43
Likewise,  the  metro’s  modal  share  of  all  trips  has
increased  steadily  from  6  per  cent  just  after  the
launch to 17 per cent in 2001. The total number of
passen gers using the metro has continued to increase,
from 2 million per day in 2001 to more than 3 million
in 2012, partly due to its relatively affordable fares.44
A comparison between metro systems worldwide
reveals certain trends. First, a majority of these cities
have  very  large  populations.  For  instance,  Tokyo’s

Box 3.2 Metros, urban structure and land use

The integration of metro systems within the urban fabric
makes some important demands on the planning system.
Rights-of-way must be established and protected. Space must
be released for depots and terminals. In addition, where high-
density ancillary devel op ments are intended, the land must be
assembled into lots suitable for devel op ment and the
appropriate densities of devel op ment sanctioned.

The most indisputable structuring effect of metros is that

they allow central business districts in large dynamic cities to
continue growing, where service by road, either by car or bus,
would be increasingly frustrated by congestion. Without the
high-capacity links, activities would begin to be decentralized.
This has implications both for city planning and for project
evaluation. A conscious attempt to maintain the growth of the
city centre will save on public infra struc ture costs in other
areas; avoiding these extra costs is an important part of the
long-term beneﬁt of metro investments.

Unfortunately, the magnitude of those savings is little

researched, particularly in devel op ing countries, and the
economic evaluation of metro investments is usually based on
the more conventional user cost–beneﬁt appraisal. While that

may still be justiﬁable, in the interest of avoiding the worst
kind of ‘white elephants’, a more wide-ranging multi-criteria
analysis may be the most suitable way of ensuring that those
unmeasured effects are taken into consideration. An
integrated land use, urban trans port and air quality strategy,
such as the Integrated Urban Transport Plan in São Paulo, is
needed to ensure that the metro system is adequately inserted
in the urban structure.

Obtaining desirable structuring effects outside the city
centre is more difﬁcult. Clustered multi-nuclear devel op ment
associated with station locations sometimes occurs
spontaneously, but normally requires either some planning by
govern ment (as in the cases of Singapore and Hong Kong,
China) or close links between private ownership of the metro
system and contiguous devel op ments (as is common in Japan).
In both cases, this requires land to be assembled for devel op -
ment in relatively large lots. This has been achieved by
comprehensive public ownership of land in Hong Kong, by
compulsory public purchase in Singapore and through market
mechanisms in some Japanese private railway devel op ments.

provinces

metro has the largest ridership in the world, and is
located in the world’s most populous urban agglom -
eration  (with  some  37  million  inhabitants45).
Similarly,  major  urban  agglomerations  such  as 
New York and Mexico City, each with an estimated
population  of  more  than  20  million  have  metro
systems that carry 4.5 million passen gers daily. Being
large also implies that metro cities are often the most
ﬁscally  sound,  while  small  municipalities  lack
economies of scale necessary to construct and operate
metros. Some of the links between metro systems
and urban structure are highlighted in Box 3.2, and
further explored in Chapter 5.

Second, urban areas with metro systems have
often extended or grown beyond their established
boundaries,  engulﬁng  surrounding  areas,  adjacent
towns  and  sometimes  into  different  provinces. 
For  instance,  Mexico  City  has  encroached  upon
municipalities  in  two  states.  Tokyo  (Japan),  which 
has the world’s largest metro system, has 75 per cent
of  its  estimated  37.2  million  population  living  in
suburban  areas.46 In  China,  Shanghai  encom-
passes a mega-urban region occupying an area of over
6340  square  kilometres,  with  the  Beijing  mega-
urban  region  extending  over  16,870  square  kilo -
metres.47 This implies that the governance of metro
systems has to go beyond the traditional city limits.
The  metro politization  of  neigh bouring  districts,
municipalities  and  cities  through  cross-boundary
institutions  offers  signiﬁcant  beneﬁts  in  terms  of
efﬁciency, construction and operation costs, includ-
ing  creating  economic  synergies  among  newly

connected areas. This is discussed in more detail in
Chapter 9.

Third, many of the cities with metro systems are
either capital cities or large cities in their respective
countries. Capital cities account for 9 of the 16 cities
with the world’s largest metro systems (Table 3.4),
and 27 per cent of all cities with metros. The rest
are major cities. For instance, in China, Japan and
Germany, besides the capital cities, 15, 12 and 18
cities in these countries respectively have metros.
Being the national capital or major city can determine
the  extent  to  which  countries  invest  in  metro
systems. This is because apart from generating more
revenue, capital or large cities dominate the system
of  settlements  and  perform  major  administrative,
commercial,  diplomatic,  ﬁnan cial  and  industrial
functions.  In  order  to  perform  these  functions
effectively,  capitals  and  other  large  cities  need  an
efﬁcient and integrated public trans port system that
includes metros.

LIGHT RAIL SYSTEMS
AROUND THE WORLD:
TRENDS AND CONDITIONS
Light rail is a ﬂexible concept that evolved from the
nineteenth century horse-driven rail carts.48 The re-
emergence as an alternative means of trans port to
cars  or  buses  was  due  to  its  potential  to  mitigate
congestion and support mobility in urban centres.

Table 3.5 
Top ten light rail and
tram systems by
ridership

Light rail systems have proliferated in both developed
and devel op ing countries in the last decades. Among
European  countries,  light  rail  systems  have  been
particularly evident in the UK, France, Spain, Portugal
and Italy. These countries have successfully improved
the quality of service and the image of the light rail
system at affordable costs. Consequently, the last 20
years have seen many cities in Asia, Africa and Latin
America reintroduce light rail systems.

In 2013, there are approximately 400 light rail
and  tram  systems  in  operation  worldwide,  while
construction  of  additional  systems  is  ongoing  in  a
further 60 cities. An additional 200 light rail systems
are either being constructed or at various planning
stages.49 There is a strong concentration of light rail
systems in Western Europe (170 systems) and in the
US  (more  than  30  systems).  Eastern  Europe  and
Central Asian countries also have a fair concentration
of light rail systems. The growing popularity of light
rail  systems  can  be  attributed  to  their  ability  to
provide  signiﬁcant  trans port  capacity,  without  the
expense  and  density  needed  for  metro  systems.50
Several African countries have developed light rail
systems such as Algeria, Egypt and Tunisia. In Algiers
(Algeria), the tramway commenced service in 2010.
When fully completed and operational, the tramway
is expected to carry between 150,000 and 185,000
passen gers per day.51 In addition, the Oran tramway
was launched in May 2013. The Oran tramway is
18.7 km long and can carry 90,000 passen gers per
day.52 A number of other African countries have light
rail projects in the pipeline. Ethiopia, for instance,
is implementing a light rail project in Addis Ababa,
covering a distance of 34 kilometres.53 Further more,
Mauritius is scheduled to commence work on a light
rail system in 2014, covering a 28-kilometre corridor
between the cities of Curepipe and St Louis.54

Globally,  light  rail  systems  are  challenged  by
ageing or obsolete assets, as well as the increasing
popularity of the private car. As a result, trans port
authorities  in  many  cities  are  rejuvenating  their
existing  light  rail  infra struc ture  or  constructing
completely  new  systems.  Increased  environ mental

consciousness  and  soaring  fuel  costs  are  also
motivating more and more people to opt for public
transport. As indicated in Table 3.5, the leading light
rail systems in the world (in terms of ridership) are
in Hong Kong and Manila.

The last two decades have seen several European
cities either overhauling or implementing new light
rail  and  tram  systems  as  a  cornerstone  of  their
redevel op ment efforts. For example, trams are part
of the transformation of 24 French cities, including
Nantes, Grenoble, Bordeaux, Clermont-Ferrand and
Marseille. Other cities such as Lille and Lyon, Caen,
Brest,  Nancy  and  Toulon  are  advancing  planning
efforts. The tram networks in France are expected
to reach a total track length of 610 kilometres by
2015.55 Even cities without light rail, such as Astana,
Kazakhstan, have reached advanced stages with plans
for the implementation of light rail.56

An  expansion  of  tram  networks  is  evident  in
other European cities. A study shows that 40 cities
and municipalities in the 15 EU countries had a total
length of 488 kilometres under construction in 2009.
A further 55 cities and municipalities had planned
1086  kilometres  of  network  devel op ments:  268
kilometres for new systems and 818 kilometres for
expansions.57

Light  rail  systems  are  beneﬁcial  for  their
technology and low emissions, and are also seen as
symbols of national pride. Mayors such as Samuel-
Weis  from  the  French  city  of  Mulhouse  have
indicated: ‘We wanted a tram that called attention
to itself, as a symbol of economic vitality, environ -
mental awareness  and  civic  improvement  –  trans -
portation as an integrated cultural concept’.58

BRT SYSTEMS AROUND 
THE WORLD: TRENDS AND
CONDITIONS
Compared to metro and light rail systems, BRT is a
relatively  recent  phenomenon,  starting  with  the
implementation of the ﬁrst busway in Curitiba (Brazil)
in the early 1970s.59 However, bus priority measures
were in place years before the Curitiba BRT system
was  implemented.  Since  then,  there  has  been  a
worldwide increase in the adoption of BRT systems.
As  of  mid-2013,  there  were  156  cities  worldwide
with  BRT  and  bus  corridors;  most  of  them  imple -
mented in the last decade (Figure 3.4).60

Since  BRT  and  metro  systems  are  both  rapid
public  trans port systems,  a  comparison  of  their
growth and performance is inevitable. BRT systems
are concentrated in Latin America and the Caribbean
(64 per cent of global ridership) and Asia (27 per cent)
(Table 3.6 and Figure 3.5). The total ridership for
BRT – 25.7 million passen gers per day – is only 23
per cent of the ridership of metro systems. In terms
of system lengths, however, BRT systems cover a total

of 4072 kilometres,61 or almost 40 per cent of the
total length of all the world’s metro systems.

The major BRT systems in the world – i.e. those
with a ridership of over 300,000 passen gers per day
– are listed in Table 3.7. BRT systems are not yet
comparable to metro systems in terms of their total
track  length  and  daily  demand;  the  longest  metro
system (Beijing) is 3.3 times longer than the longest
BRT  system  (Jakarta),  while  the  most  popular  (in
terms of daily ridership) (London) carries four times
more passen gers than the most used BRT (São Paulo).
In  Bogotá,  Colombia,  the  TransMilenio  BRT
provides  fast  and  reliable  trans port  for  over  1.8
million passen gers per day and in the process reduces
trafﬁc congestion.62 Travel time has been reduced
by 34 per cent and trafﬁc fatalities by 88 per cent.
In the case of Curitiba (Brazil), 70 per cent of com -
muters use the BRT to travel to work, thus resulting
in  a  reduction  of  27  million  auto  trips  per  year.63
When compared with eight other Brazilian cities of
similar size, Curitiba uses 30 per cent less fuel per
capita.  This  helps  achieve  air  quality  and  other
environ mental goals. By making high-capacity public
trans port more accessible, affordable and customer
friendly,  BRT  has  the  potential  to  increase  overall
public trans port ridership. In Curitiba, the BRT serves

over  1.3  million  passen gers  daily  with  commuters
spending about 10 per cent of their income on trans -
port – much less than the national average.64

Recently, African cities have made remarkable
strides  in  devel op ing  BRT  as  part  of  their  public 
trans port systems. In 2008, Lagos (Nigeria) launched
a  BRT  ‘lite’  corridor  (a  high-quality  system  that  is
afford able  in  the  local  context,  while  retaining  as
many of the desirable BRT characteristics as possible).
This marked the ﬁrst substantial investment in public
trans port for the city. The system was launched with
a  22-kilometre  route,  26  stations  and  220  high-
capacity buses, and it was designed to carry 60,000
passen gers a day. By 2010, it was carrying 220,000
passen gers  per  day,  with  more  than  100  million
person-trips being made in the ﬁrst 21 months of
operation. The ‘lite’ version of BRT halves the costs
(about  US$2.75  million  per  kilometre),  however,
capacity is limited as it uses kerb-aligned busways (not
median-aligned busways) and the total route is not
on a separated busway. As such, the overall speed
(and capacity) of the BRT system is reduced.65

The Lagos BRT has brought about many positive
changes.66 Since its implementation, over 200,000
commuters use this bus system daily, with passen -
gers  enjoying  a  30  per  cent  decrease  in  average

Note: In open systems the buses come from outside and continue in the busway, in closed systems the buses stay only in the busway (connection through feeder services). The
Jakarta system uses central closed busways in arterials that also carry bus routes in the general trafﬁc; as a result the demand for BRT services is lower than in other systems
where the service is exclusive.

fares.  Further more,  commuters  have  been  able  to
reduce their travel time by 40 per cent and waiting
time by 35 per cent, and experi ence safe, clean and
reliable transport. Other signiﬁcant socioeconomic
beneﬁts include the creation of direct employment
for 1000 people and indirect employment for over
500,000 people. The Lagos BRT has demonstrated
that local operators can run successful public trans -
port systems.67

The success of the Lagos BRT can be attributed
to  the  leadership  and  political  commitment  at  all
levels of govern ment; and a capable, strategic public
trans port authority (LAMATA), a focus on user needs
and deliverability within a budget and programme.
Also core to the Lagos BRT success was a community
engagement programme, which assured citizens that
the BRT ‘lite’ system is a project created, owned and
used by them.68 This type of engagement was crucial,
as Lagos residents had little experi ence with organ -
ized public transport. Due to a history of poor delivery
of trans port improvements – and with prior systems

that sought to ensure that proﬁt was directed to the
already  well-to-do  –  the  community  engage ment
sought to rid the residents of scepticism and suspicion
of motives and intentions regarding the project.69

With the impetus from the 2010 World Cup,
three  South  African  cities  (Johannesburg,  Cape 
Town and Port Elizabeth) all initiated BRT lines. The
Johannesburg Rea Vaya system was the ﬁrst full BRT
line  in  Africa  (2009),  operating  on  a  22-kilometre
route, costing US$5.5 million per kilometre, travel -
ling at 25 kilometres per hour and carrying 16,000
passen gers  daily.  In  2011,  the  completed  Phase  1
included  122  kilometres  of  busways  and  carried
434,000 passen gers daily.70

In  Johannesburg,  the  Rea  Vaya  BRT  links  the
central  business  district  with  Braamfontein  and
Soweto, providing fast, reliable and affordable trans -
port  for  80,000  passen gers  per  day,  and  in  the
process, reduces trafﬁc congestion on that route.71
In terms of employment, the Rea Vaya has created
more  than  800  permanent  jobs  and  about  6840

temporary construction jobs.72 Approximately 350 of
these employees are recruited among taxi drivers who
were  affected  by  the  launch  and  subsequent
operation of the BRT system.73 Transport authorities
in Johannesburg paid special attention to ensuring
that the Rea Vaya BRT was functional and attractive.
This included pre-paid tickets; level boarding for full
accessibility;  multiple  stopping  bays;  and  weather-
protected stations. Further more, the stations have
been designed with the local urban environ ment in
mind and local artists have been commissioned.74

Additional BRT schemes are being developed in
Lagos, Nigeria, as well as the aforementioned South
African cities. Similarly, other African cities are also
investing  in  high-quality,  efﬁcient  and  environ -
mentally  clean  transport.  These  include  Accra
(Ghana), Kampala (Uganda), Dar es Salaam (Tanzania),
Nairobi  (Kenya)  and  several  other  South  African
cities (Bloemfontein, Durban, East London, Pretoria,
Ekurhuleni,  Polokwane  and  Rustenburg).  This
demonstrates  the  increasing  shift  from  informal
public  trans port systems  to  high-technology  BRT
systems.75

MAIN CHALLENGES FACING
HIGH-CAPACITY PUBLIC
TRANS PORT SYSTEMS
Despite their growth, high-capacity public trans port
systems still face a number of challenges, especially
in devel op ing countries. This section discusses some
of the main challenges, which include: integration
(within  the  public  trans port system,  with  other
modes and with the urban form); quality of service;
ﬁnance; and institutions.

Integration within the public trans port
system
Integration  occurs  at  three  levels:  physical,  opera -
tional and fare. Physical integration allows for direct
connections  from  one  service  to  another,  usually
including transfer facilities and terminals. Operational
integration consists of coordination of schedules and
frequencies so that the service is guaranteed and wait
times are not excessive. Fare integration involves free
or reduced cost transfers, usually through advanced
ticketing systems. Adequate integration requires the
devel op ment of information systems to coordinate
services and provide information to the users.

Most  cities  in  developed  countries  have
advanced integration at all three levels, either through
the consolidation of a single public trans port authority
(e.g. Transport for London, UK, or the Land Trans-
port  Authority  of  Singapore),  or  the  coordination 
of multiple agencies (Consórcio de Transportes de

Madrid, Spain, or STIF in Paris, France). In contrast,
most metro, light rail and BRT systems in devel op -
ing countries are still evolving into integrated systems
with the rest of the public trans port system. In some
cases, such as Bangkok’s metro, Manila’s light rail
and Quito’s BRT, different lines are not integrated
with  one  another,  requiring  passen gers  to  incur
additional fares and walk long distances in order to
connect between stations. This has proved to be a
major disincentive to using the system. Some major
cities have successfully integrated high-capacity public
trans port systems with the rest of the public trans -
port systems  in  their  cities.  A  descriptive  list  of
these is presented in Table 3.8.

Integration with other elements of the
trans port system
Besides the integration between components of the
public trans port system, it is important to provide
adequate  connectivity  with  other  components  of 
the urban trans port system, such as walking, biking,
taxis,  informal  trans port services,  cars  and  motor -
cycles.  These  types  of  connections  complement
public  trans port systems,  as  feeder  services,  to
provide  door-to-door  connectivity  and  allow  for
expanded coverage of the public trans port system.
Walking  is  usually  the  most  common  access
mode to public trans port and requires an adequate
environ ment, with protected, well-lit, signalized and
surfaced sidewalks. Design should consider the needs
of the most vulnerable users: children, the elderly
and people with disabilities. It is important to build
these spaces according to good practices, but perhaps
even more important is to keep such spaces clean
and free of encroachments. Whereas the management
of sidewalks is often outside the jurisdiction of public
trans port agencies, adequate coordination with the
responsible agencies is important to ensure safe and
pleasant travel for public trans port passen gers who
are walking to and from the stations.

In  Singapore  for  instance,  adequate  facilities 
are provided for pedestrians. An inventory of pedes -
trian  facilities  in  Singapore  shows  that  there  are: 
491 overhead bridges; 54 pedestrian underpasses;
26 footbridges; 24 kilometres of covered linkways;
and  98,400  street  lightings.76 All  these  provide  a 
safe and comfortable walking environ ment, which is
unsurpassed in other Asian cities. Cyclists require 
two  integration  elements:  infra struc ture  and  safe
parking. As discussed in Chapter 2, bike travel should 
be separated from the walking and the motor vehicle
environ ment  as  much  as  possible  –  to  protect
pedestrians  as  well  as  cyclists.  Further more,  bike
lanes  should  be  wide  enough  to  accommodate 
bike  travel,  with  strong  segregation  from  the  car
trafﬁc.

To ensure usability by cyclists, public trans port
vehicles should accommodate bikes inside the trains

or  buses  and/or  provide  adequate  bike  parking  at
stations. In high-capacity public trans port systems,
safe parking at the integration point is recommended.
Other  mechanisms  to  provide  last-kilometre
connectivity are taxis, informal trans port services and
motor vehicle parking and pick-up or drop-off areas.
In  Nairobi,  the  Kenya  Railways  Corporation  intro -
duced last-mile link buses to convey passen gers to
and from the railway station in 2013.77 The last-mile
link  shuttle  services  pick  passen gers  from  the
surrounding areas and feed them into the Syokimau
Railway  Station,  and  thereafter  drop  them  off  at
various points within the city centre. For this purpose,
the  Corporation  has  contracted  a  private  ﬁrm  to
provide  bus  connections  for  rail  trans port  users
within the city centre.

At  important  integration  points,  especially  in 
the periphery of cities, adequate space is needed for
these mechanisms. This is to ensure that different
types of users are able to connect to the public trans -
port system and avoid using cars to go to the city
centre.

Integration with the built environ ment
Accompanied by complementary land-use and zoning
policies, high-capacity public trans port systems can
encourage compact, pedestrian and public-trans port
friendly environ ments that are integrated into the
surrounding area. Several cities, such as Copenhagen
(Denmark),  Singapore  and  Curitiba  (Brazil),  have
been  able  to  implement  efﬁcient  public  trans port
services  and  develop urban  forms  that  are  highly
conducive to public trans port ridership.78 In these
cities, public trans port and urban form function in
harmony:  either  through  mixed-use,  compact  and
accessible devel op ment suited for public trans port
(also  known  as  transit-oriented  devel op ment),  or
through ﬂexible public trans port options suited to
low-density urban devel op ment.

Singapore  is  planned  as  a  public-transport-
oriented compact city, with high-density residential
and  commercial  devel op ments  around  trans port
nodes. This improves accessibility to public transport.
Although public bus and train services are provided
on a commercial basis, all forms of public trans port

are generally affordable to the public – thus contrib -
uting  to  increased  use  of  public  trans port and  a
reduction in the use of private vehicles. The adequate
integration between public trans port and the built
environ ment makes both the public trans port system
and the city successful. High density (combined with
disincentives  to  private  car  ownership  and  use)
increases ridership, while public trans port provides
access to dense, accessible, mixed-use urban environ -
ments. Consequently, shorter trips can be completed
on foot or bicycle. The result is less vehicle kilometres
travelled  and  thus  lower  trans port  emissions  and
fewer trafﬁc accidents.

Quality of service
Quality  of  service  involves  several  elements  as
perceived by the user involving dimensions such as
travel time, reliability, safety and security, comfort
and user information. Travel time includes the door-
to-door connectivity, walking to the station, waiting
for  the  service,  travelling  on  board,  transferring
between services and walking to the ﬁnal destina-
tion.  Reliability  involves  the  conﬁdence  on  the 
arrival of the service, and the travel time on board.
Safety  implies  the  buses  and  trains  are  well
maintained and that passen gers would not be exposed
to preventable accidents. Security implies that passen -
gers travel with the realization that they would not
be victims of crime or terrorist attacks. Comfort deals
with  several  amenities,  but  mainly  with  the  space
available, or occupancy. User information comes in
many forms to allow the passen ger to navigate the
system and be aware of real time information and
contingencies.

The most advanced public trans port systems in
the world include all these dimensions of quality to
provide  a  very  attractive  alternative  to  car  and
motorcycle use. Many advanced systems in devel op -
ing countries have high-quality services, but may not
include the ﬁrst and last leg of the trip (i.e. walking
to and from the station). ‘Universal design’79 – which
is an important aspect of inclusive public trans port
systems – is often overlooked.

Cities in developed countries have incorporated
reliability as part of the key performance indicator
metrics. Nevertheless, in devel op ing cities, reliability
is not commonly measured and hence not managed.
Typically, light rail and BRT systems in devel op ing
cities  observe  train  or  bus  ‘bunching’  (i.e.  two  or
three vehicles arriving simultaneously at the stage and
gaps between vehicles). This reduces the systems’
capacity and causes high occupancy for some vehicles,
while  others  have  excess  space.  Advanced  control
systems could be used to provide real-time inform -
ation to the drivers and thereby reduce bunching.
Occupancy  levels  are  the  main  aspect  when
considering comfort. Notably, the occupancy stand -
ards in developed and devel op ing countries tend to

differ: four to ﬁve standees per square metre vs. six
to seven standees per square metre, respec tively. In
general, this is a result of ﬁnan cial considerations,
rather  than  user  acceptance  or  cultural  consid -
erations.  Higher  occupancy  standards  mean  fewer
vehicles and drivers, and less infra struc ture require -
ments. It also means that the capacity for peak ﬂows
is set artiﬁcially high.

As a result, public acceptance of several systems
can  suffer.80 For  instance,  surveys  in  São  Paulo’s
metro (Brazil), Manila’s light rail (the Philippines) and
Bogotá’s BRT (Colombia) indicate that the main user
complaint  is  over crowding  in  trains,  buses  and
stations. These surveys indicate that the occupancy
standards  adopted  are  not  acceptable  by  users,
irrespective of the public trans port mode, and should
be revised. This is important when considering public
trans port as an alternative to private motor vehicle
use. In the longer run, the high occupancy standards
may result in more people choosing motorcycles or
cars as they become more affordable due to economic
growth.

User  information  systems  include  static  and
dynamic information, and are particularly useful for
new  users,  visitors  and  for  frequent  users  making
infrequent trips. Modern systems include real-time
information on service arrivals, and voice and visual
announcements  for  the  visually  and  the  hearing
impaired.  With  the  advent  of  smart  wireless  tech -
nologies  this  type  of  information  is  gradually
becoming available on handheld devices.

Finance
The  availability  of  ﬁnance  is  essential  for  efﬁcient
urban  mobility  systems.  Conversely,  the  absence 
of  ﬁnance  can  constrain  the  ability  of  relevant
authorities  to  implement  sus tain able high-capacity
public  trans port options.  These  issues,  which  are
addressed in the paragraphs below, are examined in
greater detail with respect to urban mobility systems
in Chapter 8.

n Finan cial risks in public trans port project

devel op ment

The expansion and maintenance of metros, light rail
or  BRT  systems  require  large  amounts  of  funding. 
One  common  issue  in  developed  and  devel op ing
countries  alike  is  the  tendency  to  underestimate 
time and cost (leading to costly overruns for both),
and  overestimate  demand  during  the  decision-
making  process.  The  average  cost  escalation  of 
rail, ﬁxed link and road have been estimated at 45,
34  and  21  per  cent,  respectively;81 in  the  case  of 
over estimating demand, 84 per cent of rail projects,
and 50 per cent of road projects have been associated
with in accuracies larger than 120 per cent.82 This
issue  requires  substantially  improved  procedures
during project preparation, with strong institutions

national
governments

Many agencies in
developing
countries are not
able to retain
qualiﬁed
personnel to plan,
implement and
manage the
complexity of
public transport
projects

and evaluation processes to ensure more reliable data
to inform decision-making.

n Funding sources
Funding  for  capital  investments  in  high-capacity
public trans port requires the participation of local,
regional and national govern ments. Several countries
have  developed  programmes  to  co-ﬁnance  capital
investments in public transport, often supported by
multi-lateral  devel op ment  banks  and  international
technical assistance programmes. It is important to
recognize that the major multi-lateral devel op ment
banks – African Devel op ment Bank, Asian Devel op -
ment Bank, Devel op ment Bank of Latin America, the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Devel op ment,
the European Investment Bank, the Inter-American
Devel op ment Bank, the Islamic Devel op ment Bank
and  the  World  Bank  –  pledged  US$175  billion 
during the Rio+20 Conference to support sus tain -
able trans port between 2012 and 2022.83 This fund
will  be  used  to  promote  all  forms  of  sus tain able
transport,  including  public  transport;  bicycle  and
walking  infra struc ture;  energy-efﬁcient  vehicles 
and  fuels;  railways;  inland  waterways;  and  road 
safety. Additional sources of international funding are
the climate change ﬁnan cial mechanisms, but they
are  usually  small,  as  compared  with  the  funding
needs.84

The  national  govern ments’  interest  in  public
trans port comes from the importance of cities for the
productivity  of  the  countries,  and  national  energy
security and environ mental targets. Other consider -
ations  are  equity  and  expanded  access,  as  well  as
opportunities for low-income and vulnerable popu -
lations living in urban areas. It is also important to
have  adequate  evaluation  procedures  to  maximize 
the  beneﬁts  of  such  investments  and  avoid  cost
overruns.85

In addition to transfers from different levels of
govern ment,  local  authorities  require  innovative
funding mechanisms to support implementation and
operation of public trans port systems beyond the fare-
box revenues.86 Several potential sources for such
funding are discussed further in Chapter 8.

n Public trans port subsidies
Another important aspect of ﬁnance is the issue of
subsidies. Trans port economics literature has shown
that  public  trans port subsidies  are  efﬁcient  and
socially  worthwhile  as  public  trans port involves
several  positive  externalities  (air  quality,  climate
change,  road  safety,  physical  activity).  Thus,  the
provision  of  subsidies  to  encourage  operators  to
lower their existing fares and/or expand their existing
frequencies is socially desirable.87 The majority of the
social beneﬁts accrue from the ‘Mohring effect’,88
which  indicates  that  subsidies  increase  ridership, 
and ridership increase engenders higher service fre -
quencies,  and  the  higher  frequencies  reduce  the

average  waiting  times  at  public  trans port stops.
Hence, subsidies could be justiﬁed because of the
scale economies conferred on riders. Nevertheless,
subsidies need adequate management for them to
be  targeted  towards  service  improvements  and
serving  the  needs  of  vulnerable  populations  (low
income, elderly, handicapped). Unmanaged subsidies
may  result  in  inefﬁciencies,  such  as  excessive
overheads, large number of operators and drivers, and
high maintenance costs.89

Institutions
Urban  trans port  involves  multiple  institutions  and
levels  of  govern ment  that  are  not  always  well
coordinated. Lack of coordination results in several
issues such as the lack of integration among public
trans port components, other trans port modes and the
built environ ment. Very often, the agencies respon -
sible for metros, light rail or BRTs are only responsible
for  their  respective  mode,  with  minimal  (if  any)
coordination  with  other  components  of  the  urban
trans port system. A second institutional issue is the
lack  of  technical  and  managerial  capacity.  Many
agencies  in  devel op ing  countries  are  not  able  to
retain  qualiﬁed  personnel  to  plan,  implement  and
manage the complexity of public trans port projects.
There  is  an  urgent  need  to  upgrade  the  technical
capacity through training and professional devel op -
ment programmes. The institutional and governance
dimensions of sus tain able urban mobility systems are
discussed further in Chapter 9.

Signiﬁcant  opportunities  exist  to  enhance
technical  and  managerial  capacity,  through  direct
exchanges  among  peer  institutions  and  bench -
marking. Some examples of these efforts include:

• Nova  –  a  programme  of  international  railway
bench marking,  made  up  of  a  consortium  of
medium  sized  metro  systems  from  around  the
world:  Bangkok  (Thailand),  Barcelona  (Spain),
Buenos  Aires  (Argentina),  Brussels  (Belgium),
Delhi (India), Istanbul (Turkey), Lisbon (Portugal),
Montréal (Canada), Naples (Italy), Newcastle (UK),
Rio  de  Janeiro  (Brazil),  Singapore,  Toronto
(Canada) and Sydney (Australia). The four main
objectives  of  Nova  are:  to  build  measures  to
establish  metro  best  practice;  to  provide
comparative information both for the metro board
and  the  govern ment;  to  introduce  a  system  of
measures for management; and to prioritize areas
for improvement.90

• CoMET – a programme of international railway
benchmarking, made up of a consortium of large
metro  systems  from  around  the  world:  Beijing
(China),  Berlin  (Germany),  Guangzhou  (China),
Hong Kong (China), London (UK), Madrid (Spain),
Mexico  City  (Mexico),  Moscow  (Russia),  New
York (US), Paris (France), Santiago (Chile), São

Paulo  (Brazil),  Shanghai  (China)  and  Taipei 
(China). Just like Nova, the four main objectives
of  CoMET  are:  to  build  measures  to  establish
metro  best  practice;  to  provide  comparative
inform ation  both  for  the  metro  board  and  the
govern ment; to introduce a system of measures
for  management;  and  to  prioritize  areas  for
improvement.91

• The  International  Bus  Benchmarking  Group 
(IBBG) – a programme of urban bus operations
benchmarking, made up of medium and large bus
organizations located around the world: Barcelona
(Spain),  Brussels  (Belgium),  Dublin  (Ireland),
Istanbul (Turkey), Lisbon (Portugal), London (UK),
Montréal (Canada), New York (US), Paris (France),
Seattle  (US),  Singapore,  Sydney  (Australia)  and
Vancouver  (Canada).  IBBG  was  established  in
2004  to  provide  a  conﬁdential  forum  to  share
experi ences, compare performance, identify best
practices and learn from one another in order for
member organizations to improve performance.92
• SIBRT – whose mission is to cooperate and create
a  synergy  for  the  promotion,  consolidation  and
strengthening  of  BRT  and  integrated  trans port
systems, so that they become paradigms for the
future of mobility in Latin America and the world,
and to contribute effectively to improve the quality
of urban life.93

Additional exchanges are organized through industrial
associations such as the International Association of
Public  Transport  (global),94 the  American  Public
Transportation Association (US),95 Canadian Urban
Transit  Association  (Canada),96 and  Associação
Nacional de Transportes Públicos (Brazil).97

CONCLUDING REMARKS
AND LESSONS FOR 
POLICY
This chapter has presented empirical evidence of the
trends  and  conditions  as  well  as  challenges  with
respect to the role of high-capacity public trans port
systems  worldwide.  These  systems  play  important
social, economic and environ mental roles in terms
of facilitating more efﬁcient urban mobility systems
and sus tain able urban devel op ment patterns. Such
high-capacity public trans port systems are primarily
appropriate  for  large  and  dense  urban  agglomera-
tions,  and  serve  as  important  parts  of  integrated
public trans port systems. Accordingly, they should
be  designed  to  provide  a  competitive  and  viable
alterna tive to private cars and motorcycles.

Globally, metro systems have an average of 112
million passen gers per day. Asian cities account for

46 per cent of global ridership, followed by European
cities with 34 per cent of global ridership. As of 2013,
there are only two African cities with metro systems.
Ridership on light rail systems is signiﬁcantly lower,
although  there  are  some  400  light  rail  and  tram
systems in operation worldwide. Most of these are
found in Europe and the US, although the two light
rail systems with the highest number of passen gers
are both located in Asia.

As of mid-2013, there were 156 cities worldwide
with BRT system. The total ridership for BRT, which
is about 26 million passen gers per day, is less than
a quarter of that of metro systems. Most BRT systems
are located in devel op ing countries, particularly in
Latin America and the Caribbean, and Asia.

Metro, light rail and BRT systems have different
characteristics, each with its beneﬁts and drawbacks.
This report calls for an advanced evaluation of the
costs and beneﬁts of high-capacity public trans port
systems,  prior  to  their  implementation.  It  is  also
important to avoid endless discussions about alterna -
tives, as the worst case scenario is ‘to-do-nothing’.
A major issue relating to the successful imple -
mentation of high-capacity public trans port systems
is an accurate understanding of the requirements and
perceptions of its potential users. In order to ensure
maximum  ridership  on  metro,  light  rail  and  BRT
systems, these need to be designed and implemented
in a manner that meets the aspirations of potential
riders.

Integration  is  important  for  public  trans port
systems  to  be  efﬁcient  and  sus tain able.  The  most
efﬁcient systems are those that have achieved route
integration; integration with other public trans port
systems;  integration  with  private  motorized  trans-
port (including through encouraging drivers of private
cars to park outside the city centre and use public
trans port for  parts  of  their  daily  commute);  inte -
gration  with  non-motorized  modes  (through  easy
access  for  pedestrians  and/or  bicycle  parking  and
allowing  bicycles  onto  public  trans port vehicles);
and  fare  integration:  allowing  users  to  travel
throughout the urban public trans port system on a
single  ticket,  or  at  reduced  rates  when  switching
between  operators  and/or  lines.  Integration  also
includes  the  built  environ ment  dimension:  dense,
mixed-use and accessible urban forms enhance rider -
ship and vice versa.

Technical  inadequacies  in  the  construction  of
public trans port systems, such as ramps, gaps, steps
or waiting areas, represent signiﬁcant challenges for
vulnerable groups. Many high-capacity public trans -
port systems  are  also  characterized  by  real  or
perceived security risks. These challenges and risks
often lead to reduced ridership and exclusion of many
potential  users,  especially  women,  children,  the
elderly, disabled and minorities.

URBAN GOODS 
TRANSPORT

Urban goods
transport, also
known as urban
freight
distribution,
concerns a vast
range of activities
insuring an
adequate level of
service for a
variety of urban
supply chains

Urban freight
distribution has to
a large extent
been neglected by
urban transport
policy-makers

Urban goods transport, also known as urban freight
distribution,  concerns  a  vast  range  of  activities
insuring an adequate level of service for a variety of
urban supply chains. While cities have always been
important  producers  and  consumers  of  goods
historically,  much  of  these  activities  were  taking
place in proximity to major trans port terminals, with
limited quantities of freight entering the city itself.
The  functional  specialization  of  cities,  the  global
division of production, the emergence of intermodal
terminals, the rise of service activities, global con -
sumerism, as well as increasing standards of living
are  all  correlated  with  an  increased  demand  for
urban goods trans port in cities. This is characterized
by  a  higher  frequency  of  deliveries,  and  larger
quantities of freight shipments coming from, bound
to  or  transiting  through  urban  areas.  The  scale,
intensity  and  complexity  of  urban  goods  trans port
necessitate  additional  forms  of  organization  and
management in many large cities, which is the realm
of city logistics. City logistics concerns the means to
enable goods trans port in urban areas by improving
the  efﬁciency  of  urban  freight  transportation  and
mitigating the environ mental and social impacts.

The  need  for  city  logistics  is  often  a  derived
outcome  of  the  new  demands  imposed  by  global
supply  chains  on  regional  and  urban  landscapes.1
Since most of the goods consumed in cities originate
from  outside  locations,  urban  goods  trans port is
commonly referred to as the ‘last mile’ along a supply
chain. Urban goods trans port is thus concerned with
establishing  an  effective  interface  between  the
regional  or  global  realms  of  freight  trans port  and 
the last mile of urban freight distribution. While mari-
time  shipping,  air  cargo  or  rail  are  the  privileged
modes for long-distance goods transport, the vehicle,
particularly the truck, remains the dominant urban
mode as it is perceived to be the most suitable to
service speciﬁc origins and destinations within the
complex urban grid of streets and highways. This last
mile requires a shift to different distribution strategies
more suitable to an urban context, often resulting

in  congestion,  delays  and  additional  costs  propor -
tionally higher than the distance concerned.

The sus tain ability of cities cannot be reviewed
without  due  consideration  to  the  role  of  goods
transport.2 Indeed, while a city can be perceived as
an  economic,  social,  political  and  cultural  entity,
urban freight distribution underlines the physical and
managerial activities necessary to support all of the
above. However, compared to passen ger transport,
urban freight distribution has to a large extent been
neglected by urban trans port policy-makers. Yet, it
is extremely important for the social and economic
viability of urban areas and has widespread ramiﬁ -
cations for the environ ment, trans port infra struc tures
and overall trends in mobility. The sector is also faced
with  a  number  of  challenges  such  as  congestion,
parking  for  deliveries  and  reverse  logistics  (e.g.
recycling and garbage collection).3

This  chapter  thus  reviews  the  trends  and
conditions of goods trans port in urban areas, both
within the formal and informal sectors. It outlines
the fundamental contribution of goods trans port for
urban life, and points to the externalities generated
by the sector. The elaboration of goods trans port pro -
cesses, in both developed and devel op ing coun tries,
sheds light on the contrasts and similarities across
countries. Importantly also, the chapter shows how
goods movement interacts with, and is shaped by,
the urban context in quite speciﬁc ways.

URBAN GOODS TRANSPORT:
KEY COMPONENTS AND
ACTORS
Urban goods transport, as it relates to cities and their
populations, is the set of all activities ensuring that
their material demands are satisﬁed. The focus is on
the  city  as  a  place  of  production,  distribution  and
consumption of material goods, but also the hand-
ling  of  waste  as  an  outcome  of  these  activities.

Planning and Design for Sustainable Urban Mobility

Globalization has
enabled the
expansion of the
distribution sector
as a more
prevalent element
of the urban
landscape, with
facilities such as
terminals and
distribution
centres

Goods transport
accounts for 10 to
15 per cent of
vehicle equivalent
kilometres
travelled in urban
areas, 2 to 5 per
cent of the
employed urban
workforce, and 
3 to 5 per cent of
urban land use

Through out history, cities have had to make pro vi -
sions  for  distributing  and  storing  goods  to  their
populations.  Commercial  areas,  including  ware -
houses,  tended  to  be  located  directly  adjacent  to
facilities  such  as  ports  and  main  arterials.  The
industrial  revolution  and  later  suburbanization 
offered an extended range of options in the location
of  activities  supporting  urban  freight  distribution.
These included rail yards and highway interchanges.
The situation became inherently more complex as
the  intensity  and  variety  of  urban  goods  trans port
services  increased.  This  in  turn  made  the  import-
ance of goods trans port more salient, to the point
that concerted approaches were developed that led
to the emergence of city logistics.

While the functions of production (e.g. manu -
facturing)  and  consumption  (e.g.  retailing)  remain
prominent forms of urban goods transport, global -
ization has enabled the expansion of the distribution
sector  as  a  more  prevalent  element  of  the  urban
landscape,  with  facilities  such  as  terminals  and
distribution centres. City logistics have experi enced
signiﬁcant changes, particularly with the concept of
lean  management,  where  demand-based  supply-
chain  management  has  enabled  a  better  manage-
ment of inventories and less storage requirements.
Under  such  circumstances,  most  of  the  inventory 
is in transit using trans port modes and terminals as
‘mobile  warehouses’;  this  inventory  is  consuming
valuable urban space either as land use or as vehicles
circulating in the urban trans port system.

Most  of  the  early  city  logistics  projects  were
under taken  in  Japan  and  Western  Europe4 (e.g.
Germany,  France,  Belgium,  Netherlands,  Luxem -
bourg and the UK) as cities in these countries were
more constrained by the lack of available land, and
had well-established urban planning traditions. The
approach  was  then  adopted  in  other  parts  of  the

world, with the growing recognition that the metro -
politan area should also be considered as a freight
planning unit. Still, and in spite of a growing global
awareness,  the  focus  on  urban  goods  trans port
remains limited, partially due to an enduring bias in
urban planning concerning freight issues (Box 4.1).
An  important  technological  change  relates  to
intermodal  transportation,  which  has  considerably
improved the capacity and efﬁciency of moving freight
between  modes  such  as  maritime,  rail  and  road. 
Of particular relevance is containerization, which has
shaped  transportation  systems  in  a  fundamental 
way  by  providing  a  load  unit  that  can  be  handled
almost everywhere, and by a variety of modes.5 More
recently,  the  application  of  new  information  and
communication technologies for improving the overall
management  of  freight  distribution  has  received
attention.

Components of urban goods transport
A city is provisioned by hundreds of supply chains
servicing a wide array of economic sectors including
grocery stores, retail, restaurants, ofﬁce supplies, raw
materials and parts (for manufacturing), construction
materials  and  wastes.  Depending  on  the  circum -
stances, goods trans port accounts for 10 to 15 per
cent  of  vehicle  equivalent  kilometres  travelled  in
urban areas, 2 to 5 per cent of the employed urban
workforce, and 3 to 5 per cent of urban land use. A
city not only receives goods but also ships them: some
20 to 25 per cent of truck-kilometres in urban areas
are outgoing freight, 40 to 50 per cent are incoming
freight,  and  the  rest  both  originates  from  and  is
delivered within the city.6

There  are  three  main  components  of  city
logistics: the modes that carry the freight, the infra -
struc tures supporting freight ﬂows and the operations

Box 4.1 Urban planning and freight distribution

The consideration of freight distribution within urban planning
remains limited, leading to substantial biases in the analysis of
urban mobility, which overly focuses on passen ger issues. 
The main factors behind this oversight can be attributed to the
following:

•

•

Freight distribution is an activity predominantly controlled
and operated by private interests, with limited oversight
from the public sector. Thus, the public sector tends to
have only minimal understanding about the commercial
dynamics of freight distribution.

• Accordingly, the public sector tends to have direct control
and oversight over public trans port systems with planning
endeavours focusing on these issues.
Freight distribution is a proﬁt-seeking activity (making
goods available to customers), while public trans port is

•

more about maximizing utility (providing accessibility). 
The planning and operational objectives of stakeholders,
including their mentality, are therefore different.
There is a scale mismatch in the understanding of
urban mobility, since passen ger ﬂows are
predominantly the outcome of local processes (e.g.
commuting), while freight ﬂows reﬂect a dynamic often
being driven by processes taking place at the global
level (global supply chains).

• Urban transportation and mobility in academic and

professional programmes mostly reﬂect the realm of 
public engagement, with freight issues remaining a 
marginal component. Programmes tend to focus on
passen gers, and planners receive limited exposure to
freight issues in their training.

related to their organization and management (Figure
4.1). Each component has subcomponents with their
own  characteristics  and  constraints.  For  instance,
trans port terminals, roads and distribution centres
are infra struc ture subcomponents of city logistics.
The  same  applies  to  scheduling,  routing,  parking 
and  loading/unloading,  which  are  operational  sub -
components.

While  trucks  remain  the  dominant  mode
supporting city logistics, they face constraints mainly
related to congestion and environ mental externalities.
This is in spite of the prominence that road infra -
struc ture takes over urban land use, as well as park -
ing  and  unloading  (or  loading)  difﬁculties  at  the
points of ﬁnal delivery. The balance in the relative
importance of the depicted subcomponents appears
to be unsus tain able in a growing number of urban
areas. A major challenge for city logistics is there-
fore  a  rebalancing  where  alternative  modes  (such 
as electric vehicles) and infra struc ture (such as local
freight stations), improved by novel forms of opera -
tions, would play a more prominent role. Obviously,
the  nature  and  extent  of  this  rebalancing  is  city
speciﬁc.

City logistics, as a last-mile distributional strat -
egy,  can  take  many  forms  depending  on  the  con -
cerned supply chains, as well as the urban setting in
which it takes place. It involves two main functional
classes:  the  ﬁrst  concerning  consumer-related  dis -
tribu tion and second producer-related distribution.
Independent retailing, chain retailing, food deliveries
and parcel and home deliveries constitute consumer-
related distribution while producer-related distribu -
tion involves construction sites, waste collection and
disposal, industrial and terminal haulage.

Actors and stakeholders in urban goods
trans port
Freight can be handled commercially by two types
of actors: private and common carriers. For private
carriage,  freight  is  carried  out  by  cargo  owners
(manufacturers or retailers) with their own employees
and ﬂeet, or by subcontracting to an independent
carrier with its own vehicles. A common carrier sells
its services to any customer on a contractual basis
and will often consolidate their cargo and deliveries.
There is a signiﬁcant geographical variation in the role
of  private  and  common  carriers  in  urban  goods
transport. While in developed countries private and
common carriers tend to account for an equal share
of urban deliveries, in devel op ing countries private
carriers tend to be dominant. This is reﬂective of an
urban  freight  distribution  market  that  is  not  well
developed and assumed in part by an informal sector
using motorized and non-motorized means.

The  global  production  network  concerns  an
array of manufacturing activities mostly organized by
multi-national corporations in search of comparative

advantages.  This  is  associated  with  a  growth  in
international trade, where cities assume the function
of  production  zones  for  parts  and  ﬁnished  goods
bound to global markets. Intermodal terminals are
the interfacing means to access the global distribution
network. This network supports international trade
that circulates over a global network of intermodal
terminals  linked  by  modes  such  as  maritime  ship-
ping,  air  freight  and  for  shorter  distances  by  rail 
and trucking. In this frame, cities act as distribution
nodes with their major port, airport and rail terminal
facilities. In many instances, a city will play the role
of  a  gateway  granting  access  to  a  regional  freight
distribution system, implying that freight distribution
will have a spatial imprint well above one justiﬁed
by the level of urban consumption.

The  global  urban  network  is  reﬂective  of  the
intensity  of  material  consumption,  since  from  a
material standpoint the main function of cities is to
act as points of ﬁnal consumption. The multitude of
actors and supply chain concerned requires a growing
level  of  organization  and  management  of  urban
freight distribution. This is particularly problematic
since  cities  are  highly  constrained  areas,  with  a
limited  amount  of  space  available  for  circulation,
deliveries and warehousing. However, the differences
between cities in devel op ing and developed countries
remain salient, particularly over freight ﬂows.

In terms of stakeholders of commercial goods
trans port in  urban  areas,  it  is  possible  to  identify 
four general groups that are shaping urban freight
distribution:  cargo  owners  (e.g.  retailers,  manu -

facturers, wholesalers); residents; distributors (mostly
carriers, third party logistics companies and freight
forwarders); and planners and regulators. The rela -
tions between the cargo owners who provide goods
and the residents who consume them, with distrib -
utors acting on the cargo owners’ behalf, are particu -
larly  important  as  cargo  owners  and  distrib utors
strive to fulﬁl consumers’ needs. Planners and regu -
lators  try  to  set  rules  under  which  urban  freight
distribution takes place, with the multi-dimensional
aim of satisfying their constituents as well as com -
mercial,  trans port  and  distribution  interests.  Each
stakeholder has its own objectives, and while there
may  be  inherent  conﬂicts  between  stake holders,
under  normal  circumstances  the  relations  tend  to 
be on the neutral side. However, when a challenge
in  city  logistics  requiring  an  inter vention  from 
either a public or private stakeholder emerges, the
relation ships  between  stakeholders  are  likely  to
change, which can lead to four possible outcomes
(Figure 4.2):

• Conﬂicts. Due to the scarcity of space, as well
as the density and the complexity of the urban
landscape,  conﬂicts  between  stakeholders  are
common. These conﬂicts arise when the extern -
alities of existing or proposed projects imposed
by urban freight distribution on local commun-
ities are judged to be unacceptable by residents,
planners and regulators. Sometimes conﬂicts arise
between the residents and planners over speciﬁc
issues  triggering  classic  NIMBY  (not-in-my-
backyard) responses. Legal recourse is attempted
to stop a devel op ment project (e.g. a new dis tri -
bution centre) or to more strictly regu late a freight
activity (e.g. access to a commercial district).

• Cooperation. Usually achieved when additional
mitigation  strategies  are  added  to  a  project 
(change in design) or to modes of operation. It is
agreed  by  some  form  of  consensus  that  the
existing capacity is to be used and shared more
rationally. Public–private partnerships are exam -
ples where private goals and public interests can
be accommodated.7

• Competition.  Standard  relationships  between
private shippers and freight forwarders as they bid
to access urban real estate and facilities for their
operations. Freight forwarders compete to attract
and retain customers over their freight distribution
services. Commercial and residential developers
are  also  competing  within  the  land-use  zoning
framework for real estate projects.

• Coopetition.  A  speciﬁc  form  of  collaboration
between private stakeholders, particularly when
a  stakeholder  is  unable  to  individually  address 
an issue or is incited to do so by regulation. While
they  may  compete  for  attracting  and  retaining
customers, freight forwarders could be involved
in  shared  operations.  Activities  related  to  the
con solidation  of  urban  freight  distribution  are
particularly  prone  to  coopetition  with  shared
facilities  (e.g.  urban  distribution  centres)  or
deliveries (e.g. shippers pooling their demand to
negotiate better terms with a freight forwarder).

TRENDS AND CONDITIONS
OF URBAN GOODS
TRANSPORT
Cities  are  concomitantly  areas  of  production,
distribution and consumption. The growth in global
trade  reﬂects  growing  levels  of  production  and
consumption  taking  place  in  urban  areas.  While
speciﬁc  ﬁgures  are  not  readily  found,  it  can  be
assumed that most of global trade either originates
in, transits through, or is bound to, an urban area.
The  associated  growth  in  global  distribution  has
reinforced  the  role  of  gateway  cities,  nodes
interfacing with global economic processes, mostly
through ports and airport terminals (Box 4.2).

The  city  is  also  increasingly  transnational.
Depending on the economic and geographical con -
text, some cities (such as London, UK; New York,
US;  Paris,  France;  and  Tokyo,  Japan)  have  a  pro -
nounced tertiary function (ﬁnance, administration,
culture), implying that consumption accounts for the
main share of the total goods being handled, with
the functions of production and distribution assuming
a more marginal role. Other cities (such as Bangkok,
Thailand; Busan, Republic of Korea; Guangzhou and
Shanghai,  China)  have  emerged  as  manufacturing
centres  where  production  assumes  the  dominant
share of goods ﬂows. With the increasing use of the
container  and  the  growth  of  long-distance  trade,
several cities act as intermediaries for the goods ﬂows
bound to large market areas. For instance, gateway
cities often fulﬁl the material requirements of whole
regions  by  being  a  point  of  freight  transit  and
distribution to service inland destinations.

Inasmuch as a majority of urban inhabitants do
not  interact  with  freight  facilities  or  have  little

Box 4.2 Gateway cities and global distribution

A gateway city is a pivotal point for the entrance and exit of
goods in a region, a country or a continent. The global system
of freight distribution is articulated by major gateway cities,
often composed of a cluster of ports and airports within a
metropolitan area. Altogether, the 39 largest gateway cities
accounted for 90 per cent of the global containerized and air
freight volumes (Figure 4.3). This underlines their fundamental
importance in the handling of the world’s trade and as
intermediary (or ﬁnal) locations within global distribution
systems.

There is a substantial concentration of freight activity

along the Tokyo–Singapore corridor in Asia. The world’s
largest gateway region is Hong Kong–Shenzhen; 14.8 per

cent of the world’s containerized and air freight trafﬁc is in
this region. Expanding this gateway to the Pearl River
Delta (with Guangzhou), which can be considered a mega-
urban region (Box 5.11), causes this share to reach 16.7
per cent. For Europe, the Rhine/Scheldt delta (from
Amsterdam to Brussels) accounts for 7.5 per cent of the
global containerized and air freight volume. The most
important North American gateway system is the Los
Angeles/Long Beach system. Some of the gateways are
dominantly hubs transhipping freight from one system of
circulation to the other, such as Colombo (Sri Lanka),
Dubai (United Arab Emirates) or Singapore.

awareness of their existence, these play a funda mental
role in the urban economy or a city’s welfare. Urban
freight activities support the supply chains in urban
areas and there is a clear link between these activities
and the level of economic devel op ment of cities as
highlighted  below.  The  following  sub section  also
points out areas of convergence between the devel -
oped and devel op ing countries with respect to urban
goods transport, as well as describing key areas of
divergence  as  dictated  by  the  level  of  economic
devel op ment priorities, among other factors.

Developed countries
The  material  intensiveness  of  urban  freight  dis -
tribution  depends  on  local  economic,  geographic
and  cultural  characteristics.8 It  is  not  surprising 
that cities in developed countries with high standards
of living are coping with a high intensity of urban
goods transport. Evidence from Europe suggests that
a high-income city generates about one delivery or
pickup per job per week, 300 to 400 truck trips per
1000 people per day, and 30 to 50 tonnes of goods
per person per year.9

Planning and Design for Sustainable Urban Mobility

In addition to
formal goods
transport, an
informal sector –
that may rely on
less advanced
modes and
management
techniques – is
also very active in
supplying the
needs of lower-
income groups [in
developing
countries]

However,  conditions  vary  signiﬁcantly  based
upon local characteristics and the role cities play in
global  freight  distribution.  For  example,  Chicago 
has been preoccupied with maintaining its role as a
major rail hub for North America, and is thus primarily
concerned  with  rail  freight  trans port  between  the
numerous rail terminals and large distribution centres
located within its metropolitan area, many of which
are serviced by trucks.10 Los Angeles as a gateway
city to North America is primarily concerned with
air pollution, and thus targets truck trans port associ -
ated with port terminals and nearby major import-
based  distribution  centres.11 Paris,  France,  is  con-
cerned with limiting the environ mental footprint of
freight distribution in order to improve the quality
of life of its residents and maintain its role as one of
the world’s leading cultural and tourism hubs.

Devel op ing countries
The conditions in which urban goods trans port takes
place  in  devel op ing  countries  show  an  impressive
diversity. Several segments of economic activity have
a high level of integration to global economic pro -
cesses and their related freight distribution. Thus, it
is  not  surprising  to  ﬁnd  state-of-the-art  trans port
facilities such as port terminals, airports and distribu -
tion centres in devel op ing countries. This aspect of
city logistics is therefore on par with those of devel -
oped countries as the same modes, technol ogies and
management techniques are used.

However, in addition to formal goods transport,
an informal sector – that may rely on less advanced
modes  and  management  techniques  –  is  also  very
active in supplying the needs of lower-income groups.
These may include motorized means such as two-
wheelers,  and  more  signiﬁcantly,  non-motorized

forms  of  goods  trans port (Box  4.3).  While  several
basic consumption goods (apparel, electronic goods,
batteries, etc.) enter a country through formal supply
chains, a majority enter through informal distribution
channels. The informal sector provides crucial city
logistics services in devel op ing countries, but tends
to be more labour intensive, thus increasing the risk
of damage, theft or injuries.

The  differences  between  formal  and  informal
activities are also linked to gender and age. While
workers involved in formal forms of transportation,
such  as  delivery  truck  drivers,  are  predominantly
male, retail workers dealing with the last segment
of city logistics are predominantly female. In the least-
developed  countries,  the  transportation  burden  of
household  needs,  such  as  fuel,  water  and  food, 
and many other petty trades, is mainly assumed by
women.12 However,  urban  goods  trans port can 
also be a source of income, albeit subject to risks,
for the urban poor and other lower-income groups.
For children and teenagers, informal freight distribu -
tion is a common source of income, before attaining
driving age.13

As in developed countries, the conditions and
priorities  in  devel op ing  countries  substantially
diverge.  For  instance,  Mexico  City  is  coping  with 
a  complex  mix  of  urban  growth,  rising  consump-
tion levels, congestion and environ mental external-
ities where both modern and informal forms of city
logistics  are  present  (Box  4.4).  With  its  function 
as a major trans port hub supporting China’s export-
oriented economic strategies, Shanghai has become
the largest cargo port in the world, with advanced
logistics  capabilities.  This  highlights  the  contrast
between city logistics of the modern coastal cities
of China, in comparison to a countryside that is much
less integrated.

Box 4.3 Non-motorized informal goods trans port in Asia and Africa

In Delhi, India motorized tricycles haul small loads requiring
frequent delivery stops, and handle around 60 per cent of
intra-city goods movement, transporting as much as a 5-tonne
truck in a day via multiple trips. As well as courier services,
deliveries of groceries, furniture, electronics, etc. are
increasingly made by auto-rickshaws, vans and tricycles, while
larger informal carriers – such as shared taxis, mini buses and
light vans are used for longer distances. In most of South Asia,
trip-chains involve intermodal connections between micro-
vehicles and large-load haulers at railway stations, bus depots,
distribution centres, etc. Although efﬁcient and affordable, the
limited income earned by indigenous goods haulers
undermines capital investment in more efﬁcient vehicles.
Access to credit can thus be an important factor for improving
city logistics in devel op ing economies.

Non-motorized trans port is also frequently used for
goods delivery in African cities, due to it being cheap and
readily available. In Mumbai, India, about 200,000 tifﬁn lunch
boxes are delivered daily by a combination of non-motorized
means, thereby generating employment for those involved.
Forms of NMT trans port for goods in African cities include
three-wheel platform rickshaws (gudrum matatu in Dar es
Salaam, Tanzania), waste cart pushers (kayabola) in Accra,
Ghana, and animal-drawn carts in South African low-income
townships for waste picking, scrap metal haulage and coal
delivery.

Box 4.4 Relationships between formal and informal city logistics, Mexico City

Mexico City, with a population of 20 million, typiﬁes very large
and fast-growing metropolises of emerging economies. The
city is a logistics gateway of Latin America where many
regional headquarters of multi-national companies and
associated advanced services are located. It also accounts for a
third of the country’s manufacturing output. The informal
sector is also a signiﬁcant feature of Mexico City’s economy,
with a high number of very small businesses in operation. As
an enormous urban centre whose activities and population
generate a high and diversiﬁed demand for freight, its logistics
features relate to both formal and informal processes.
The part of goods trans port that is formal (and

documented) represents about 400 million tonnes annually,
and is mostly based on road transportation. The main and
growing mode of freight supply is trucking, whose ﬂows and
characteristics are well surveyed. Despite recent private
investments, congestion, the lack of space for loading and
unloading, regulatory complexity (e.g. weight and access

restrictions), public corruption, the risk of theft and the lack of
safety, there are widespread concerns for freight distribution
in the city. Congestion is an acute issue, as it can take up to
four hours for trucks to cross the city. As a consequence,
many companies are moving their logistics facilities to
suburban areas, where several extensive logistics clusters have
grown to accommodate distribution centres and private
logistics facilities. Further more, inadequate infra struc ture in
Mexico City leads to poor regional accessibility, which hinders
market extension and international integration, and keeps
logistic costs high.

At the same time, informal means of transportation

(foot, wheelbarrows, bikes, motorbikes) represent a signiﬁcant
share of freight transport, but are difﬁcult to record. All these
features make Mexico City a good example of the challenges
facing urban freight management in very large cities in
emerging economies.

GOODS TRANS PORT IN AN
URBAN CONTEXT
Goods trans port systems are often speciﬁc to distinct
urban built environ ments, implying that no city is
alike with respect to the nature and challenges of its
city logistics. In addition to broader factors shaping
the  conditions  of  urban  goods  trans port such  as
geographical  settings,  history,  levels  of  economic
devel op ment  and  govern ment  policies,  the  urban
context  shapes  goods  trans port trends  in  speciﬁc
ways.

Urban  density  is  closely  associated  with  pat-
terns of goods transport. While cities in devel op ing
countries tend to have higher densities than cities
in  developed  countries,  higher  income  levels  in
developed countries increase the generation of freight
per  density  level.14 High-density  areas  are  associ-
ated  with  high  absolute  consumption  levels,  but 
ade quately supplying such needs is not without chal -
lenges. This tends to be paradoxical, as high densities
are commonly advocated as sus tain able urban devel -
op ment goals. However, high urban densities can also
result in congestion if mass forms of transportation
(i.e. public transport) are not ade quately provided.
Still, high density provides addi tional opportunities
to consolidate deliveries and use alternative modes.
The  distribution  of  the  density  in  relation  to 
the  street  layout,  or  urban  spatial  structure,  also
inﬂuences goods transport. Many urban areas that
were established before motorization have a street
layout that is not suitable for goods transport, with
narrow  and  sinuous  streets.  Up  to  some  density
levels, a motorized and grid-like street layout provides
an efﬁcient setting for urban deliveries but comes

with externalities such as high energy consumption,
noise and emission of pollutants.

The  urban  land-use  structure  relates  to  the
organization  of  economic  activities,  which  can  be
centralized, decentralized, clustered or dispersed, and
impacts upon goods transport. Therefore, a decen -
tralized  and  dispersed  land-use  structure  is  thus
associated with a disorganized urban goods trans port
system, as it becomes problematic to reconcile origins
and destinations in urban inter actions. For instance,
delivering the same quantity of goods in a decentral -
ized and dispersed land-use setting generally involves
longer  trips  and  more  frequent  stops  than  in  a
centralized and clustered setting.

The city scale in terms of population size may
also inﬂuence urban goods trans port trends. While
there  is  no  formal  methodology  to  make  such  an
assessment, empirical evidence in the US underlines
that congestion starts to be a recurring issue once a
threshold of about 1 million inhabitants is reached.15
This obviously concerns cities having a high level of
motorization, thus applying this threshold to a range
of  cities  around  the  world  is  problematic,  since
each city has unique local conditions that inﬂuence
the nature and intensity of congestion, such as the
share of public-trans port use and land-use density.
For instance, Antwerp (Belgium) with a population
of nearly a million appears to be well below the con -
gestion threshold, but this overlooks the fact that it
is one of Europe’s main port cities. The amount of
truck-based  freight  circulating  within  the  metro -
politan area, particularly on the ring roads, is well
above any city of a similar size.

space  in  urban  areas  and  competes  with  other
activities for the use of land and infra struc ture. Land
requirements for urban goods trans port are signiﬁcant
as  both  trans port  modes  and  terminals  consume
space for the setting of their respective infra struc -
tures.16 Industrial land uses are also complementary
to city logistics, as they are important generators and
attractors  of  freight  ﬂows.  Additionally,  there  are
rights  of  way,  mainly  roads,  that  are  often  shared
between goods and passen ger transport.

The land used for freight infra struc ture can be
particularly extensive in metropolitan areas that are
points of convergence for global material ﬂows, and
involve several stakeholders (Table 4.1). However,
the amount of land devoted to freight is not neces -
sarily related to the size or the level of consumption
in a city. Some cities (such as Dalian and Ningbo,
China) focus on production such as export-oriented
economic  devel op ment  zones,  while  other  cities
(such as Singapore; Dubai, United Arab Emirates; Los
Angeles, US; and Panama City, Panama) are major
gateways  or  hubs  managing  regional  systems  of
freight circulation.

Freight facilities such as intermodal terminals
and  distribution  centres  tend  to  be  highly  capital
intensive and mechanized. The sections below high -
light how the growing consumption of land by these
facilities has led to new forms of dislocation within
urban  areas,  in  terms  of  terminal  and  distribution

facilities. The discussion also describes the tendency
for spatial de-concentration of these facilities in areas
where there is severe land pressure.

Terminal facilities
Intermodal transportation places tremendous pres -
sure on the land in metropolitan areas, particularly
those  with  container  terminals  and  their  ancillary
facilities  (e.g.  access  ramps,  container  and  chassis
storage). The global urban footprint is estimated to
account for 658,760 square kilometres, about 0.51
per cent of the total global land area.17 A sample of
the  world’s  453  largest  container  port  terminal
facilities reveals that they jointly account for 230.7
square kilometres of land take (0.035 per cent of the
total urban area).18 Although this ﬁgure represents
a very small share of urban land use, container port
terminal facilities occupy prime waterfront real estate,
which is a scarce resource in coastal areas. The con -
struction of new port facilities now requires extensive
land  reclamation  projects  as  suitable  sites  are  no
longer readily available. For instance, the construction
of  the  Maasvlatke  II  port  terminal  in  Rotterdam
(Netherlands) or the Yangshan container port near
Shanghai (China) are examples of the massive land
reclamation demands that new port terminal facilities
require. The true transportation land take for freight
distribution is difﬁcult to assess as many infra struc -

tures, such as roads and airports, are mainly used for
passen ger trans port and can be considered as shared
facilities.

Wherever there is an intermodal facility, there
is a tendency to have an agglomeration of distribution
facilities. This is particularly the case for large airports
located  near  clusters  of  distribution  centres  and
third-party  logistics  services  providers;  air  freight
being  a  time  sensitive  endeavour  requiring  supply
chain managers to be in proximity. As a result, a new
urban form, the ‘aerotropolis’ is taking shape around
major  airports.19 It  contains  an  inner  zone  of  dis -
tribution centres, logistics complexes and just-in-time
manufacturers. In addition, it includes a ring of ofﬁce
parks,  hotels,  restaurants  and  convention  centres, 
and then a largely residential periphery, which serves
as the home to those who work in the aerotropolis.
High-capacity highways and rail lines provide access
to the rest of the metropolitan area, within which
an aerotropolis is set. These activities are competing
at a global level, which commonly implies that the
economy of the aerotropolis tends to be linked more
to  global  processes  than  to  regional  ones.  Dubai,
United Arab Emirates, may be the best example of
a  planned  aerotropolis,  but  several  Asian  airports
(such as such as Bangkok, Thailand; Singa pore; and
Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia) have initiated this type of
devel op ment. A few examples can also be found in
the US and Europe, including Dallas-Fort Worth (US)
and Schiphol (Netherlands).

Distribution facilities
Distribution  land  requirements  include  various
facilities to hold freight in bulk storage facilities (e.g.
oil reservoirs or grain silos) and warehousing facilities
for break-bulk (e.g. consumer goods in containers).
Distribution  centres  consume  a  lot  of  space,  as  a 
wide array of added-value activities are performed 
on a one ﬂoor design, including consolidation and
deconsol idation, cross-docking and storage. The last
of these can also require specialized facilities, such
as cold storage for supporting urban food distribution.
It was estimated that for England and Wales alone,
ware housing was accounting for 0.8 per cent of non-
agricultural and forestry land.20

The spatial distribution of industrial, commer-
cial and logistics facilities has a direct impact on the
number of vehicle-kilometres, and the average trip
length that will be necessary to reach stores, indus -
tries and households. In cities such as Chicago, US,
which emerged after the late nineteenth and early
twentieth centuries, most of the freight-related activ -
ities such as industries, warehouses and terminals
were located in close proximity to the central busi -
ness  district.  A  majority  (more  than  two-thirds,  in 
the case of European cities) of all shipments to and
from  urban  areas  are  organized  from  terminals 
and distribution centres. As a result, a contemporary

pattern where logistics are specialized and separated
from other urban activities has emerged.

Global  supply  chains  rely  on  novel  forms  of
urban land use such as the logistics zone, which is
a planned area entirely devoted to freight distribution.
While in the past, the agglomeration of freight dis -
tribution activities would organically take place where
land was available, and where (road) accessibility was
suitable, logistics zones are often set by large trans -
national  real  estate  promoters  and  some,  labelled 
as  ‘freight  villages’,  can  include  ancillary  activities
such as hotels, convention centres and restaurants.
In some devel op ing countries (Brazil, Malaysia), the
export-oriented free trade zone has become a city
within the city, with a value proposition based on
foreign  investments  and  access  to  global  markets
through  port  and  airport  facilities.  China,  with  its
special  economic  zones,  epitomizes  this  type  of
devel op ment, which sheds light on Chinese urban -
ization processes along its coastal areas. In the last
30 years, employment opportunities in special eco -
nomic  zones  such  as  Shenzhen  (China),  were  a
strong  driver  behind  the  migration  of  100  to  140
million people from inland provinces.21

Logistics sprawl
Another key trend is logistics sprawl, or the spatial
de-concentration of logistics facilities in metropolitan
areas. Confronted with the severe land pressure in
large cities, as well as with the large urban renewal
projects that took place during the 1960s and 1970s,
logistics  and  trans port  companies  began  to  follow
centrifugal locational patterns (Box 4.5). The physical
moves were achieved through small-scale changes in
their spatial organization, with the closing of urban
distribution centres and the opening of new ones in
the periphery. Greater land requirements and better
accessibility to highways were two of the main driving
forces.

While it results in the creation of new spaces,
better ﬁtting the functional and operational charac -
teristics of freight distribution, logistics sprawl also
creates challenges. With globalization, large terminal
and warehousing facilities have generated demands
for land to support urban goods distribution, but also
conﬂicts and dislocations. Another impact of logistics
sprawl  concerns  the  patterns  and  the  modes  of
commuting. Due to their low density and suburban
settings, logistics zones are generally not well serviced
by  public  trans port and  contribute  to  automobile
dependency.

The  spatial  structure  of  metropolitan  areas 
has led to forms of city logistics that seek to provide
the most suitable distribution strategy, based upon
the level of density. While higher density levels are
associated with congestion and difﬁculties for urban
deliveries,  they  also  offer  additional  opportunities 
for alternative forms of urban distribution (Box 4.6).

Box 4.5  Logistics sprawl, Paris, France

Paris can be considered one of the most active European cities
in the ﬁeld of urban freight management. The city-region has a
population of 11 million, and is among the largest and most
economically developed metropolitan areas in the world. Ile-
de-France is an important logistics hub, concentrating 17
million square metres of warehouses, which represents a
fourth of the French warehousing market. Paris has a very high
commercial density; it hosts many independent retailers and
food stores, and a high proportion of hotels, cafés and
restaurants, due to Paris’ role as one of the world’s most
popular tourist destinations.

An important feature of urban and regional freight

transportation is referred to as ‘logistics sprawl’; the
relocation of freight facilities and distribution centres in
remote suburban areas. During the 1970s and 1980s, terminals
that were used for freight trans port and logistics activities in
Paris relocated to outlying municipalities (Figure 4.4).
However, the economic activities have not dispersed as much
as logistics facilities. This has increased distances for delivery
trucks to reach destinations, adding a lot of vehicle-kilometres
to the regional trafﬁc.

Box 4.6 Land use and forms of city logistics

A metropolitan area can be serviced through several freight
distribution strategies that vary in scope depending on the
level of urban density.a An urban freight distribution strategy
that is frequently used in high and low urban densities alike is
illustrated in Figure 4.5 and constitutes the following three
elements:

• Urban logistics zones try to rationalize the multiplication

of freight distribution transport, as well as their longer
distances, by providing space in relative proximity to
central areas. They are commonly developed over
brownﬁeld sites that can provide additional beneﬁt if
adjacent (co-located) to existing port, airport or rail
terminal facilities. Users have the opportunity to
consolidate their urban deliveries.

• Urban freight distribution centres are shared facilities

interfacing with a set of distribution centres, each being

connected to their respective supply chains.b Thus, a wide
array of supply chains can achieve a better efﬁciency within
the central city. In this case, the last mile’ is assumed by
shared vehicles operating on the behalf of the urban freight
distribution centre’s customers. On some occasions, urban
freight distribution centres can combine several activities
within the same facility, such as ofﬁce and retail functions,
to maximize revenue generation.

• Urban freight stations are small facilities where cargo can
be dropped and picked up. A common problem in parcel
delivery or pickup is that it requires both the customer
and the carrier to be available at the same time and
location. Urban freight stations near highly frequented
locations offer the highest proximity level to customers,
and can therefore mitigate the matching issue between the
delivery vehicle and the customer.

As the density of urban land use increases, special -
ization becomes more effective and enables a nar -

centre servicing a low-density area often needs to
carry a large variety of goods in its inventory for a
longer period of time.

CHALLENGES OF URBAN
GOODS TRANSPORT
The diffusion of modern freight distribution systems
on the urban landscape generates environ mental
and social externalities, ranging from vehicle emis -
sions, accidents and congestion to logistics sprawl.
Addressing these externalities represents a set of

environ mental, economic, social and institutional
challenges (Table 4.2).

Environ mental challenges
Road transportation is the most polluting land trans -
port  mode  per  vehicle  kilometre  travelled,  but
urban freight distribution offers limited alternatives
to roadways.22 Air pollution has decreased with the
gradual  phasing  out  of  leaded  petrol  and  better
engine  design.23 However,  diesel  trucks,  the
dominant mode of urban deliveries, remain a major
source  of  particulate  matter  and  nitrogen  oxide
emissions.24 The share of urban freight depending
on the informal sector is hard to evaluate, as are
economic, environ mental and social indicators for
these unreported activities.25 For the same number

Key challenges in urban
goods transport

of tonne-kilometres, urban freight distribution tends
to be more polluting, often twice as much as long-
distance freight transport. The main reasons are as
follows:

Trucks account
for 22 per cent 
of the global
greenhouse gas
emissions
generated by
transportation,
but due to
circulation
conditions in
urban areas this
share is higher

• Vehicle age. Urban delivery vehicles are older
than  the  average  freight  trans port  truck.  It  is
common that trucks end their lifecycle in drayage
operations26 between port or rail terminals and
urban distribution centres. The renewal of freight
ﬂeets is generally slower than that for non-urban
road freight trafﬁc, because urban freight involves
numerous  competing  small  operators  that  cut
costs as much as possible. This problem is com -
pounded in devel op ing countries where vehicles
are even older, and thus more prone to higher
emissions and accidents.

• Vehicle size. Urban delivery vehicles tend to be
smaller  than  standard  freight  trucks,  implying
that some economies of scale advantages are lost.
While  smaller  vehicles  may  be  prone  to  fewer
emissions per kilometre travelled, at an aggregate
level, this may result in more emissions because
of a greater number of vehicles required to carry
the same amount of freight.

• Operating speeds and idling. Urban operating
speeds are slower due to congestion and trafﬁc
restrictions, implying that the engines of delivery
vehicles are running at speeds consistently lower
than the optimal speed. This results in higher fuel
consumption and higher emission levels. Constant
acceleration and deceleration due to trafﬁc lights
and trafﬁc congestion result in an increase in fuel
consumption,  as  well  as  the  wear  on  vehicles.
Vehicle idling is frequent either for deliveries or
at stops, which contributes to emissions.

Greenhouse gas emissions and noise pollution are
other environ mental effects of urban freight trans -
port. Trucks account for 22 per cent of the global
greenhouse gas emissions generated by transporta -
tion,27 but due to circulation conditions in urban areas
this share is higher. For instance, in large European
cities,  freight  trans port  is  responsible  for  a  third 
of  transport-related  nitrogen  oxides  and  half  of

transport-related particulate matter emissions, mostly
due to a higher reliance on diesel fuels for trucks.
In London, freight distribution accounts for less than
10 per cent of urban trafﬁc but contributes to 30
per cent of nitrogen oxide emissions and 63 per cent
of particulate emissions.28 In the metropolitan area
of  Mexico  City,  about  60  per  cent  of  particulate
matters  generated  by  mobile  sources  were  from
freight  vehicles.29 While  little  is  known  about  the
potential vulnerability of urban goods trans port to
climate  change,  it  is  assumed  that  events  such  as
ﬂoods, storms and heat waves will be as disruptive
to urban goods trans port as they are to urban activities
in general.30

Since urban areas are large consumers of ﬁnal
goods,  the  issue  of  reverse  logistics  deserves
consideration, as it involves the collection of wastes
and recycling of materials.31 City logistics and environ -
mentally sus tain able logistics (green logistics) are thus
decisively  linked.  Most  developed  countries  have
formal  recycling  programmes,  while  in  devel op ing
countries cities essentially leave a signiﬁcant share
of the recycling of goods to the informal sector. The
recycling  of  used  goods,  packages  and  cardboard
takes speciﬁc forms; scavengers and recyclers are an
important feature of city life, with active informal
supply  chains.  The  urban  landscape  of  devel op ing
countries  also  includes  active  street  vending,
providing  a  wide  range  of  retail  and  food  goods.
Informal  settlements  are  also  an  important  com -
ponent  of  the  city  landscape  in  many  devel op ing
countries, and have speciﬁc characteristics and supply
needs that are not well documented.

Economic challenges
The  growth  in  the  amount  of  freight  circulating
within  urban  areas  has  further  exacerbated  trafﬁc
congestion. Urban goods trans port is usually subject
to smaller volumes but with frequent deliveries, as
inventory levels in urban stores tend to be low. Due
to the limited availability of storage space in central
areas,  urban  goods  are  delivered  regularly  from
distribution  centres  at  the  periphery.  However,
despite peak-hour trafﬁc congestion, a regular ﬂow
of deliveries must be maintained. This incites freight
distribution activities to take place during the night
if possible. Further more, many stores in high-density
areas  have  limited  capacity  to  accommodate  deliv -
eries, implying that delivery trucks must park along
the street in the vicinity of the store, preferably in
front. This induces the usage of smaller trucks better
able to circulate within urban areas and ﬁnd parking
space for deliveries. It is not uncommon for trucks
to  double-park  for  short  deliveries,  thus  seriously
impeding local circulation.

Since  real  estate  is  at  a  premium  in  urban 
areas, stores tend to have limited warehousing space
and  are  smaller  in  size.  Urban  freight  distribution

Box 4.7 Cities and logistical performance

No international comparative analysis of the logistical
performance of cities has yet been undertaken, but
country-wide surveys have been compiled in recent years
by the World Bank. The logistics performance index 
(LPI) is a composite index based on proxy measures for 
trans port and information infra struc ture, supply chain
management and trade facilitation capabilities. These
indicator scores are calculated using a world survey of
international freight forwarders and express carriers. LPI
values range from 1 (worst) to 5 (best) and show that
building the capacity to connect ﬁrms, suppliers and
consumers, is key, in a context where predictability and
reliability are becoming as important as costs in supply
chain management. An LPI value of less than 3 reﬂects an
array of problems within a country’s freight distribution
system, causing undue delays and additional costs. For
instance, a difference of one point lower in the LPI is
related to two to four additional days of port hinterland
access, and a 25 per cent higher physical inspection rate 
at customs. The performance metrics of the LPI do not
capture the environ mental and social externalities of
logistics.

While the LPI reﬂects global trade and supply chains, it

can also be reﬂective of the logistical capabilities of cities. 
For instance, a low LPI is reﬂective of inefﬁcient customs
procedures, including governance that does not appropriately
regulate and mitigate urban freight distribution. Of the world’s
cities with more than 1 million inhabitants, 334 million
inhabitants lived in cities within countries with a low LPI (less
than 3), and 593 million lived in cities with below average LPI
conditions (between 3 and 3.5). Only 330 million people were
living in cities of more than 1 million inhabitants, with good LPI
conditions (more than 3.5). It can thus be inferred that more
than half of the world’s urban population are living in cities
where the logistical capabilities are deﬁcient. This assessment
should be interpreted with caution, as signiﬁcant national
differences exist, for example, between coastal China, which
has efﬁcient export-oriented freight distribution systems, and
its interior provinces where the quality of trans port infra struc -
tures is more inadequate. Port and airport cities tend to have
more capabilities for city logistics, because of the availability of
international trade infra struc tures and a concentration of third
party logistics service providers.

is  subject  to  smaller  volumes,  with  time-sensitive
freight  necessary  to  replenish  a  constant  demand.
This  requires  a  high  frequency  of  deliveries,  par -
ticularly  considering  high  sales  volumes,  which
imposes a contradiction in the cargo load. Stores in
central areas would beneﬁt from the economies of
scale of larger deliveries, but the setting does not
permit this advantage. This is one of the reasons why
retailing has emerged in suburban areas. Large stores
with ample parking space can have their own cargo
docking  bays  that  can  accommodate  the  largest
delivery trucks available; the beneﬁts of economies
of scale are multiplied with economies of distribution.
The tendency of large urban areas to have high
congestion  levels  poses  a  challenge  towards  the
reliability of freight distribution. This is particularly
the case for the disruptions and lower driving speeds
that urban congestion imposes, making urban freight
distribution  prone  to  inefﬁciencies,  compared  to
circulation taking place in a suburban or non-urban
setting. Although there have been some attempts to
assess countries’ performance on trade logistics (see
for example Box 4.7), the logistical performance of
cities  remains  problematic  and  difﬁcult  to  assess.
However, evidence shows that port and airport cities
tend  to  have  more  capabilities  for  city  logistics
because of the availability of international trade infra -
struc tures and a concentration of third-party logistics
service providers. A share of these capabilities is used
for urban freight distribution.

The diffusion of e-commerce has also created
new forms of demands and new forms of urban dis -

tribution  with  a  growth  in  home  deliveries.32 The
parcels industry has been booming, largely because
of e-commerce, and in some cases has been proactive
at establishing novel forms of last-mile deliveries.

Social and institutional challenges
From a social standpoint, the interactions between
people and freight in cities create many disturbances
related to health, safety (accidents) and the quality
of life (Table 4.3). Urban goods trans port can have
substantial impacts on the communities they originate
from, are bound to or are transiting through. This 
is particularly the case when large freight facilities
such  as  a  port,  airport,  rail  yard  or  distribution
centres are operating. Passen ger and freight trans -
port  do  not  mingle  well,  particularly  during  com -
muting  around  peak  hours  where  both  systems
seriously  impair  their  respective  capacity  and  per -
formance. In devel op ing countries, trafﬁc con gestion
is a signiﬁcant operational problem for city logistics,
with  slow  non-motorized  vehicles  sharing  urban
roads with motorized trafﬁc.

Freight-intensive  activities  such  as  terminals,
container storage areas, warehouses and truck depots
can be an aesthetic blight on the urban landscape,
and  are  associated  with  lower  property  values.  As
many  freight  facilities  operate  on  a  24-hour  basis,
lights can be an annoyance and a source of poten-
tial sleep disruption. Further more, living or working

dis advan tages  include  associated  healthcare  costs,
productivity losses for workers and general impair -
ments in the quality of life. Noise emissions by urban
freight distribution, including terminal operations, are
also a salient issue, as trucks are noisier than other
vehicles.

Safety  is  an  important  consideration  for  both
citizens and freight operators. Freight vehicles are
not  necessarily  more  unsafe  than  other  vehicles, 
but because of blind spots, slower vehicle reaction
times, larger loads or loads of hazardous materials,
freight should always be considered in the planning
process. It may be particularly important to under -
stand how freight vehicles interact with motorized
and non-motorized passen ger transportation. There -
fore, the risk of accidents by heavy freight vehicles
and  the  reconciliation  of  truck  trafﬁc  with  non-
motorized trans port is an emerging policy concern.
This  is  mainly  due  to  the  safety  issues  that  arise 
when heavy freight vehicles encounter pedestrians
on  local  streets.  Given  that  freight  contributes  to
trafﬁc congestion, it has a negative impact on the
social cohesion of communities, resulting in lower
levels of social interaction.33

Workers in the freight distribution sector, from
drivers  to  warehouse  workers,  have  a  higher
occupational risk than most professions.34 A majority
of freight-related jobs offer low wages and limited
beneﬁts to their employees, in a work environ ment
that is fast paced and prone to accidents and injuries.
Safety  issues  can  also  arise  during  the  frequent
shipment and transportation of hazardous materials
taking place along urban corridors. Also, the prev -
alence of sexual risk behaviour among truck drivers
along  urban  corridors  and  in  some  cities  has  had
negative social impacts and exacerbated the spread
of HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases
in  many  devel op ing-country  cities.  In  Brazil,  for

instance, high levels of sexual risk behaviour were
recorded  among  truck  drivers  in  two  port  cities,
Santos and Itajai.35

From a regulatory standpoint, urban areas are
highly constrained with a variety of rules related to
zoning,  emissions  and  even  access  conditions  to
roads and terminals. High population densities imply
a low tolerance for infringements and disturbances
brought  by  freight  distribution.36 Actors  involved 
in  urban  goods  trans port are  thus  prone  to  more
regulatory pressures than freight forwarders operating
outside  major  urban  areas.  This  represents  an
additional  risk  of  having  urban  freight  activities
deemed  a  nuisance,  which  could  result  in  costly
mitigation  strategies.  For  example,  several  major
airports  within  metropolitan  areas  have  had  their
night operations curtailed due to noise emissions over
nearby residential districts.

Further more,  compensation  and  resettlement
mechanisms are often not adequate, particularly in
devel op ing  countries  where  the  state  and  local
govern ments use the power of eminent domain to
create  spaces  for  transportation  infra struc tures, 
thus increasing the vulnerability of the poor in cases
of involuntary resettlement. Another issue gaining
prominence in urban goods trans port is the need to
address environ mental justice, since concentrations
of  the  poor  and  minority  populations  suffer  dis -
proportionately  from  negative  social  impacts  from
transportation-related  devel op ments.37 This  is  far
from  being  a  recent  phenomenon,  as  the  siting 
of  communities  with  lower  economic  status  was
historically associated with proximity or adjacency to
terminals and industrial areas. Often, communities
are  caught  in  a  vicious  circle  of  deriving  limited
beneﬁts  from  activities  integrated  in  global  and
national supply chains that generate strong extern -
alities. In this context of growing conﬂicts between
freight and the city, port authorities tend to be more
proactive in mitigating the social impacts on adjacent

For instance, in 2010 the Port of Los Angeles (US),
after  pressures  from  adjacent  communities,  estab -
lished the Port Community Mitigation Trust Fund,
where capital derived from port operations was set
aside  to  be  invested  in  social  and  environ mental
mitigation efforts.38

EXISTING POLICY
RESPONSES
Urbanization and its associated growth in material
consumption  have  reached  a  point  where  a  more
concerted approach to freight distribution is advo -
cated.39 This requires an understanding of the key
challenges  in  urban  freight  distribution  and  the
dissemination of practices and methods, notably data
collection, to enhance urban mobility and sus tain -
ability.40 As stated earlier, urban areas are constrained
and  subject  to  a  complex  regulatory  framework.
Thus, the urban space is prone to conﬂicts between
different  stakeholders,  but  there  are  also  oppor -
tunities for collaboration as space for urban logistics
must  be  recognized  as  a  fundamental  element  of
urban planning.41 It can be complex for a distributor
to adapt homogeneous freight distribution practices
to a speciﬁc urban environ ment with its particular
regulations.

Further more, priorities diverge. In Europe and
Japan, an enduring concern relates to the circulation
of heavy vehicles in urban areas, as density and the
physical  characteristics  of  streets  challenge  urban
freight distribution. In North America, due to lower
densities, the focus has been on load consolidation
as urban deliveries are commonly less than a truck -
load.  In  many  devel op ing  countries,  the  lack  of
resources often hinders adequate policy responses.
Still,  an  array  of  policies  have  been  considered  to

mitigate urban freight distribution problems, most
of  which  are  related  to  trafﬁc  congestion  (Table
4.4).42

Rationalization of deliveries
Night deliveries are emerging as a preferable strategy
for city logistics since they take place at a time when
there is less trafﬁc congestion and fewer conﬂicts as
a  result  of  commuting.  However,  night  deliveries
impose  important  changes  in  the  organization  of
labour, for both the freight forwarder and the con -
signee. Distribution centres must be open at night,
even intermodal terminals, while the consignee must
have labour available to receive deliveries. For smaller
stores, night delivery could impose prohibitive addi -
tional labour costs. In such a setting, carriers tend
to  prefer  night  deliveries,  since  their  vehicles  can
operate in a less-congested setting, with the possi -
bility of using larger vehicles, while retailers would
prefer  daytime  deliveries  that  correspond  to  the
availability of their workforce. In high-density areas,
night deliveries can also result in local disturbances
such as noise at a time when families are at home.
Extended delivery windows provide additional
options, particularly outside peak hours. Like night
deliveries, they impose challenges in the organization
of labour with longer and irregular hours. Devel op -
ing  countries  are  better  placed  to  see  the  imple -
mentation of this form of rationalization as labour
conditions  are  more  ‘ﬂexible’,43 but  operational
margins for activities such as retail are tight.

Freight facilities
Freight facilities can be designed and adapted to suit
the  requirements  of  city  logistics.  An  important
aspect is to achieve a level of consolidation of loads,
many of which are less than a truckload, so that more

Planning and Design for Sustainable Urban Mobility

Appropriate
design of bus
stations – i.e. with
a section allocated
to freight (e.g.
delivery areas and
warehouses) – is a
strategy that could
help mitigate city
logistics problems
in several
developing
countries

Using bicycles as
cargo vehicles is
particularly
encouraged when
combined with
policies that
restrict motor
vehicle access to
speciﬁc areas of 
a city

The existing
public transport
system could also
be used to move
freight, but this
implies numerous
challenges: in
terms of the
adaptation of
modes, the usage
of existing
passenger
terminals and
scheduling issues

cargo can be placed per delivery vehicle. One such
facility  is  labelled  the  urban  freight  transhipment
centre, where deliveries bound to speciﬁc commercial
districts are grouped even if for different customers.
It is similar to cross-docking facilities used by retailers
to organize their regional distribution. These facilities
encourage a better usage of delivery assets, resulting
in less trafﬁc congestion in central areas. This is linked
with  higher  costs,  as  an  additional  consolidation
stage  takes  place  at  the  urban  freight  distribution
centre.  This  again  involves  additional  delays  and
undermines  the  potential  proﬁtability  of  such  a
strategy. It is also likely that the common delivery
service does not necessarily meet the requirements
of  the  consignee  in  terms  of  delivery  time  and
frequency.

Local freight stations are an additional alternative
in  high-density  areas,  by  offering  a  local  point  of
consolidation  or  deconsolidation  for  pickups  and
deliveries. Cargo is delivered by trucks to local freight
stations,  with  the  ﬁnal  deliveries  from  the  freight
station to the consignee commonly done on rolling
carts. The implementation of local freight stations 
has received limited attention, particularly due to its
higher costs and lack of ﬂexibility to accommodate
the  needs  of  speciﬁc  supply  chains.  Automated 
locker banks are a type of local freight station that
is gaining momentum, since it ﬁts well the needs of
e-commerce. In Germany, the Deutsche Post (DHL)
has installed thousands of ‘PackStations’ at strategic
locations,  so  that  consignments  can  be  delivered 
at any time of the day. In the US, the giant online
retailer Amazon initiated a similar initiative with the
setting of delivery lockers in the central areas of large
cities, mostly in collaboration with pharmacies and
convenience stores that have long opening hours.

An  important  element  of  urban  freight  dis -
tribution in devel op ing countries is the bus station,
which  doubles  as  a  nexus  for  regional  passen-
gers’  transportation  and  a  common  point  of  entry 
for freight.44 These stations are particularly relevant
since vehicle ownership tends to be low, with the
population  relying  on  intercity  bus  services.  Small
freight  forwarding  companies  and  distribution
centres, often informal, are ﬁlling an important role
in city logistics. Appropriate design of bus stations
– i.e. with a section allocated to freight (e.g. delivery
areas and warehouses) – is a strategy that could help
mitigate city logistics problems in several devel op -
ing countries, particularly since bus stations tend to
be centrally located.

Another strategy concerns the implementation
of designated delivery areas, ensuring that delivery
vehicles have better access to consignees, and that
deliveries take place in a less disruptive fashion (e.g.
avoiding double-parking). However, reserving parking
space for deliveries implies that less parking space
is available for passen ger vehicles, which can lead to
conﬂicts with residents (even if freight parking spaces

are available during the night). Despite the availability
of delivery areas, the intensity of freight distribution
may create a parking demand beyond the capacity of
available delivery areas.

Modal adaptation
Urban  delivery  vehicles  can  be  adapted  to  better 
suit the density of urban distribution, which often
involves  smaller  vehicles  such  as  vans,  including
bicycles. The latter have the potential to become a
preferred  ‘last-mile’  vehicle,  particularly  in  high-
density  and  congested  areas.  In  locations  where
bicycle use is high, such as the Netherlands, delivery
bicycles are also used to carry personal cargo (e.g.
groceries).45 Due  to  their  low  acquisition  and
maintenance  costs,  cargo  bicycles  convey  much
potential  in  developed  and  devel op ing  countries
alike, such as the becak (a three-wheeled bicycle) in
Indonesia.46 Services  using  electrically  assisted
delivery tricycles have been successfully implemented
in France47 and are gradually being adopted across
Europe for services as varied as parcel and catering
deliveries.  Using  bicycles  as  cargo  vehicles  is
particularly encouraged when combined with policies
that restrict motor vehicle access to speciﬁc areas of
a city, such as downtown or commercial districts, or
with the extension of dedicated bike lanes.

Efforts can also be made to have less polluting
and more energy-efﬁcient vehicles, including CNG
and  electric  vehicles,  which  can  reduce  energy
consumption  and  lower  environ mental impacts.
However, these vehicles tend to be more expensive,
which  can  be  prohibitive  in  devel op ing  countries.
Further more, greener vehicles and alternative fuels
cannot mitigate the increasing trafﬁc levels world -
wide.  Information  technologies  that  are  actively 
used by parcel carriers, such as vehicle tracking, load
management and navigation, have the potential to
improve  the  usage  of  distribution  assets  such  as
warehousing space and vehicles. The introduction of
such technologies can lead to new forms of urban
distribution, such as collaborative distribution (com -
peting activities, such as stores, hotels and restaur -
ants, using the same distribution services) with better
trip sequence matching (better order of pickups and
deliveries  to  minimize  travelling  distance).  Since
information technologies are increasingly low cost
and  ubiquitous  (e.g.  cellular  data  networks),  such
applications are suitable in both developed and devel -
op ing countries.

The existing public trans port system could also
be used to move freight, but this implies numerous
challenges: in terms of the adaptation of modes, the
usage of existing passen ger terminals and schedul-
ing issues. One particular point of concern is that 
the mandate of public trans port authorities does not
involve freight. As a result, many agencies either have
little incentive or do not have the legal authority to

Urban Goods Transport

73

As  new  strategies  and  practices  are  imple -
mented, and also because of a trend towards higher
energy  prices,  more  efﬁcient  urban  freight  distri -
bution systems will emerge as part of a transition
towards greener forms of city logistics. Such strat -
egies are centred mostly around the rationalization
of  deliveries;  the  devel op ment  of  freight  facilities
better  adapted  to  the  urban  environ ment;  and  a
modal adaptation (vehicles, including non-motorized
modes, better adapted to urban circulation). While
these strategies are likely to reﬂect the unique modal
and  infrastructural  lattice  of  each  city,  it  remains
uncertain if advances in city logistics will be sufﬁcient
to cope with growing levels of congestion and the
related socioeconomic externalities, particularly in
devel op ing countries. Accordingly, unique forms of
city logistics are emerging in devel op ing countries,
due to signiﬁcant differences in levels of income and
density.  However,  these  cases  are  far  less  docu -
mented.

Goods  trans port  remains  a  fundamental  ele-
ment of urban sus tain ability. Thus, it is essential that
the role and impact of goods trans port in the urban
context  is  taken  into  consideration,  if  planning
accessible mobility for passen gers is to be effective.
This  is  especially  so  when  considering  the  close
interactions  between  urban  land  use,  form  and 
goods  trans port within  an  increasingly  contested
landscape.

develop freight initiatives. Fares can also be an issue,
since public trans port fare systems are per passen -
ger with no equivalent for freight. From a logistics
perspective, the rationale behind using public trans -
port is limited, as it involves load-break and potential
breaches in integrity. Many attempts at devel op ing
‘cargo-trams’  (tramways  adapted  to  carry  cargo) 
have failed, such as the ambitious cargo-tram project
in  Amsterdam  (the  Netherlands)  that  went  bank-
rupt  in  2009.48 The  expansion  of  passen ger  rail
services in suburban areas often raises conﬂicts, due
to the dominance that freight assumes in interurban
services.  For  instance,  passen ger  rail  services  and
freight  trains  that  share  the  same  track  segments 
are likely to result in delays and schedule integrity
issues.  Outside  building  new  rail  infra struc tures,
the  options  are  limited  to  stringent  infra struc ture
sharing agreements between passen gers and freight
rail services.

CONCLUDING REMARKS
AND LESSONS FOR POLICY
The city of the twenty-ﬁrst century is a city of intense
ﬂows of people, material and information. As such,
goods  trans port is  a  fundamental  component  of 
the urban environ ment, an issue that until recently
was neglected in the planning process. The challenge
is to balance the need to ensure efﬁciency of goods
transport,  while  minimizing  externalities  such  as
congestion,  the  emission  of  pollutants,  noise  and
accidents.

MOBILITY AND URBAN 
FORM

Heightened  concerns  over  climate  change,  rising
gasoline prices, trafﬁc congestion and social exclusion
have sparked renewed interest to explore the link
between mobility and urban form.1 Worldwide, city
ofﬁcials share relatively similar concerns about travel
time, air quality, road accidents, social integration,
better  accessibility  and  improved  use  of  different
modal trans port solutions.

Despite this, most cities, particularly in devel -
op ing countries and emerging economies, continue
to prioritize motorized trans port and related urban
infra struc ture. A large number of cities both in the
devel op ing and developed countries are experiencing
fast  and  uncontrolled  growth  in  their  peripheries.
Consequently, there is a wide variety of urban forms,
deﬁned by land-use and transportation systems that
are not conducive to the provision of ‘efﬁcient’ forms
of  urban  mobility.  There  can  be  little  doubt  that
designing neigh bour hoods, cities and regions in a way
that  can  reduce  private  car  dependency,  promote
healthier, more sus tain able urban forms and a variety
of travel solutions, can make the city more accessible
to  all.  The  pressure  to  develop sus tain able trans -
portation and mobility systems is particularly acute
in urban areas.

In recent years, city planners, developers and
policy-makers  have  increasingly  looked  towards
designing more compact cities with a mixture of land
uses in order to achieve a more sus tain able urban
form. The ‘compact city’ policy, although difﬁcult to
implement, can help shorten travel distances, thus
lower emissions and fuel consumption, reduce travel
costs  and  improve  quality  of  life  in  many  cities.
However, there is need for better solutions on how
to move from current unsus tain able trends in urban
form and transportation towards a more sus tain able
future.

There is increasing evidence that the form and
functionality of the city is crucial for the promotion
of sus tain able mobility. Indeed, transforming cities
wherein a mix of activities is closer together, in a
more  compact  conﬁguration,  and  interlaced  by 

high-quality pedestrian and bicycle infra struc ture, is
tantamount to the creation of a more accessible city.
As stressed in Chapter 1, accessibility lies at the core
of achieving an urban form that is environ mentally
sus tain able,  socially  equitable  and  inclusive,  with
higher potential to generate economic interactions
that lead to productivity and income gains. Sus tain -
able mobility is an outcome of how cities and neigh -
bour hoods are designed and take form, but it also
shapes the urban form itself. This reﬂects the power -
ful,  bi-directional  relationship  between  mobility 
and urban form that underscores the importance of
care fully coordinating and integrating the two. A re -
invigorated notion of urban planning, solid institu -
tions and governing structures is therefore required,
which  can  lead  a  process  for  this  transformative
change.

A  number  of  pressing  mobility  and  environ -
mental issues,  which  policy-makers  at  all  levels 
of  govern ment  are  wrestling  with  today,  hinge  on
changes in the design and form of cities for a more
efﬁcient and sus tain able solution. With the trans port
sector accounting for nearly a quarter of greenhouse
gas  emissions  in  metropolitan  areas  worldwide,
campaigns to stabilize the global climate include the
creation of less car-dependent urban forms.2 Stop-
ping  sprawl,3 promoting  public-transport-oriented
growth and creating compact, walkable neigh bour -
hoods that reduce vehicle-kilometres travelled (VKT)
per person are the cornerstones of such campaigns. 
The EU’s Climate Change Programme calls for the
promotion of ‘low-emission land-use activities’ as a
way to moderate VKT growth, making an interesting
connection  between  urban  form  and  transport.4
It is important to track VKT per capita, as it is the
strongest single correlate of environ mental degrada -
tion and resource consumption in the urban trans -
port sector. It has been projected that, in the absence
of substantial reductions in VKT per capita worldwide,
all  increases  in  fuel-efﬁcient  and  low-carbon  fuels 
will only slow, not reverse, the rise in per capita CO2
emissions.5

Planning and Design for Sustainable Urban Mobility

Environ mental objectives are but one reason for
moderating urban travel. There are important eco -
nomic and social considerations to be made as well.
Spread-out, car-oriented devel op ment patterns, com -
monly  referred  to  as  ‘sprawl’,  burden  municipal
budgets, imposing high costs for extending infra struc -
ture and public services to suburbs and exurbs. The
‘hard cost’ of providing local roads and utilities for
low-density growth is upwards of US$30,000 more
per household in the US compared to more compact,
mixed-use growth.6 If one-third of the future urban
growth of the US were directed toward central cities
and  inner-suburbs,  an  estimated  US$10,000  per
household  (in  year  2000  US$)  could  be  saved.7 A
recent  study  estimated  that  converting  peripheral
housing projects to inﬁll planned residential devel -
op ments in the consolidated parts of Malaysian cities
could reduce the ﬁnan cial costs for municipal services
by 19 per cent.8

Growing concerns over social equity have also
prompted interest in the design of cities. Physical
separation  from  jobs,  schools  and  health  clinics
imposes  economic  burdens  on  the  poor,  many  of
whom reside on the urban periphery. Overcoming
this  physical  separation  often  means  devoting  dis -
proportionate shares of income to public trans port
fares and enduring long journeys. Besides shortening
journeys and making social amenities more accessible,
the connection between adequate trans port solutions
and the provision of public goods can promote more
social interactions and when done properly, gives rise

to  urban  form  that  is  conducive  to  community
building and ‘place making’.

This  chapter  describes  current  global  trends
and conditions that have inﬂuenced urban form and
as  a  result,  mobility  (or  the  lack  thereof).  Forces
propelling the spread-out growth of cities and the
impacts  of  these  trends  on  urban  mobility  are
discussed. The capacity of higher urban densities to
encourage  alternative  means  of  travel,  particularly
public trans port usage, is reviewed. Other elements
of built environ ments, such as the diversity of land
uses  and  urban  designs,  like  integrated  bikeway
networks, and their implications for travel, are also
examined. Creating compact, mixed-use and highly
walkable neigh bour hoods and cities can create more
accessible  urban  landscapes,  and  in  so  doing
moderate levels of motorized travel and the ill-effects
associated  with  it.  More  accessible  cities  are  also
more  socially  equitable  and  inclusive.  The  other
direction of the relationship – how urban trans port
infra struc ture,  such  as  motorways  and  metro-rail
systems, shapes urban form – also receives attention.
The chapter closes with discussions on the potential
of various policy strategies, such as transit-oriented
devel op ment  (TOD)  and  regional  jobs–housing
balance, to strengthen mobility–urban form linkages
and promote sus tain able trans port modes.

Box 5.1 Suburbanization in Eastern Europe

The transitional economies of Eastern Europe have witnessed
rapid suburbanization. During the era of centralized planning,
most cities in Eastern Europe were products of integrated
transportation and land devel op ment, characterized by
extensive urban rail networks with residential towers,
shopping districts and industrial zones physically oriented to
stations. The change to free-market economies and
privatization of land devel op ment quickly unravelled this. In
some Eastern European countries, the rate of suburbanization
has surpassed that of cities in Western Europe. The latest
studies of land-cover changes have ranked cities in Estonia,
Latvia, Croatia, Slovakia, Poland, Hungary and Bulgaria, as
among the most sprawling urban areas in Europe. By one
account:

‘“communist” urban forms were by many measures more
environ mentally friendly and, thus, more sus tain able than
capitalist urban forms. They were more compact and had
smaller ecological footprints; they were high-density and
had a clear urban edge rather than sprawling and mono-
functional suburban-type peripheries; they had better
integrated land uses and were less socially polarized; they
had abundant parks and greenbelts; and, they had reliable

public transit systems. Ironically, all these aspects of the
communist city are hallmarks of urban sus tain ability. Most
of them were lost during the post communist transition.’a

Privatization of land devel op ment, such as the construction of
mega-malls and housing estates on the periphery, coincided
with the abandonment and often discontinuation of former
state-owned urban rail services, which along with the rapid
growth in private car ownership resulted in motorways being
built in their place. Some observers have criticized
international aid agencies – such as the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Devel op ment and the European
Investment Bank – for fanning the ﬂames of sprawl in Eastern
Europe by favouring investments in suburban motorways over
revamping and upgrading aging inner-city rail lines. Hyper-
suburbanization has spawned dramatic shifts in travel, such as
in Prague, Czech Republic, where former trips by foot or
public trans port to central-city shops are rapidly being
replaced by long-distance car trips to freeway-served malls and
large-scale retail outlets, dramatically increasing VKT.

Box 5.2 Dispersed growth in India

In recent years, Indian cities have witnessed an accelerated
transformation of agricultural lands on their peripheries to
new townships, residential subdivisions and commercial
centres. This has lead to marked increases in trafﬁc
congestion, air pollution, demand for roads and parking,
accidents and energy consumption. Around Mumbai, seven
new towns have emerged within 50 kilometres of the old 
city. Around Delhi as well, new urban centres have cropped
up within 20 to 50 kilometres radius of the city centre. 

Most public policies in India encourage sprawl. In an explicit
attempt to decongest city centres, govern ment regulations
limit ﬂoor to land area ratios for buildings in the centre, and
thus restrict building heights and devel op ment densities. By
contrast, govern ment regulations allow higher ﬂoor space
indexes in suburban areas, effectively pushing new growth
from the core to the periphery.

DECENTRALIZATION, CAR
DEPENDENCE AND TRAVEL
This section reviews the inﬂuences of decentralized
urban growth on mobility and travel worldwide, the
role  played  by  trans port  in  the  decentralization
process, as well as the impact of urban densities and
urban land coverage on travel.

The dispersal metropolis
The dispersal of growth from the urban centre is a
worldwide  phenomenon.  Dispersal,  as  a  form  of
decentralization, at least when it is poorly planned,
lies at the heart of unfolding patterns of urban devel -
op ment that are environ mentally, socially and eco -
nomically unsus tain able. With dispersal come: lower
densities, separation of land uses and urban activities,
urban  fragmentation,  segregation  by  income  and
social class, consumption of precious resources such
as farmland and open space and more car-dependent
systems. While megatrends like rising afﬂuence and
modernization  have  fuelled  the  dispersal  of  cities
worldwide,  social-cultural  factors  have  played  a 
role as well. In Latin America, land held by govern -
ment  agencies,  military  authorities  and  religious
founda tions  often  triggers  leapfrog  (i.e.  skipped-
over) devel op ment.9 Social exclusion, class segrega -
tion and poverty itself can also stretch the boundaries
of cities; tugurios and favelas (i.e. slums) mark the
peripheries of most Latin American cities. In Chinese
cities,  peri-urban  devel op ment  is  partly  driven  by
ﬁnan cial motives, e.g. municipalities buy land at low
agricultural prices and lease the land to developers
at higher prices as a way to raise revenues. Like in
China, the transition to free-market economies has
accelerated  suburban  growth  throughout  Eastern
Europe (Box 5.1). In India, zoning policies that sup -
press  permissible  densities  as  a  means  of  decon -
gesting central cities have been blamed for inducing
sprawl  in  recent  decades  (Box  5.2).  Easy-to-obtain
credit  for  low-income  housing  has  triggered  an
explosive growth in low-cost but isolated residential
enclaves  on  the  outskirts  of  many  Mexican  cities,

Dispersal of
growth from the
urban centre is a
worldwide
phenomenon

which over time has led to abandonments; between
2006 and 2009, some 26 per cent of such housing
that was built was unoccupied.10 Nearly a third of
individuals  who  abandoned  their  homes  did  so
because of poor access to jobs, schools and family.
Urban  dispersal  has  an  unmistakable  and
profound inﬂuence on travel. Spread-out growth not
only lengthens journeys by separating trip origins and
destinations,  but  also  increases  the  use  of  private
motorized vehicles. In developed countries, suburban
living, associated with the lowering of population and
employment  densities,  has  contributed  to  rising
motorization rates and the environ mental problems
related to car dependency. When urban dispersal is
driven  almost  exclusively  by  market  forces  and  is
largely unplanned, car dependency, energy consump -
tion, environ mental degradation and social problems
in  urban  areas  are  further  exacerbated  (Box  5.3).
Over-regulation of urban devel op ment (e.g. zoning
codes that require signiﬁcant supplies of off-street
parking)  can  also  induce  car-dependent  sprawl  by
suppressing market preferences. Increasingly, trends
both in developed and various devel op ing countries
suggest  that  many  young  adults  want  to  live  in
compact, walkable neigh bour hoods.11

Urban sprawl is increasingly prevalent in devel -
op ing countries. From 1970 to 2000, the physical
expansion of all urban areas in Mexico was nearly
four  times  more  than  their  urban  population
growth.12 In Cairo (Egypt), Sana’a (Yemen), Panama

Box 5.3 Urban sprawl

The term ‘urban sprawl’ describes low-density, dispersed, single-use, car-dependent
built environ ments and settlement patterns that, critics charge, waste energy, land and
other resources and divide people by race, ethnicity and income/wealth. A cardinal
feature of sprawl is the physical separation of co-dependent land uses – e.g. housing is
isolated from jobs, schools, hospitals, retail activities, etc. – leading to increasingly
lengthy (and thus resource-consuming) journeys. Sprawl is synonymous with poorly
planned, piecemeal and haphazard patterns of urban growth, requiring larger shares of
trips to be made by motorized modes over increasingly longer distances.

Planning and Design for Sustainable Urban Mobility

City  (Panama)  and  Caracas  (Venezuela),  sprawl  is
blamed  for  consuming  scarce  agricultural  lands 
and dramatically increasing municipal costs for infra -
struc ture and service delivery.13 In urban Sub-Saharan
Africa, Latin America and South Asia, sprawl has been
associated  with  class  segregation.  Often,  higher-
income households occupy the most accessible and
expensive districts near the urban core, forcing many
low-skilled, low-income immigrants from rural areas
and  displaced  low-income  inner-city  residents  to
outlying, marginal areas, where land is cheaper. Class
and income disparities are deeply embedded in the
spatial arrangements and mobility challenges of many
devel op ing-country cities.14

Global urban density patterns and trends
Figure 5.1 shows that Asian and African cities are,
on average, around 35 per cent denser than cities in
Latin America, 2.5 times denser than European cities,
and  nearly  10  times  denser  than  cities  in  North
America and Oceania (mostly from the US, Australia
and New Zealand). Overall, 39 of the world’s 100
densest urban areas were situated in Asia in 2010.15
Cities of devel op ing countries have been sprawling
more  rapidly  than  those  in  developed  countries.
From 1990 to 2000, average urban densities fell from
3545  to  2835  people  per  square  kilometre  in
developed countries compared to a drop from 9860
to 8050 people per square kilometre in devel op ing
ones.16

A  two-century  perspective  reveals  dramatic
longitudinal declines in urban densities, especially 
in devel op ing countries. Figure 5.2 traces the down-
ward  trend  in  built-up  area  densities  for  25  cities 
from as early as the late 1700s to 2000. Densities
declined fourfold from their peak, from an average
of 43,000 persons per square kilometre to an average

of 10,000 persons per square kilometre around the
year 2000, at an average annual rate of 1.5 per cent.17
At  this  rate,  urban  densities  can  be  expected  to
decline another 26 per cent by 2040. According to
one projection, a continuation of the trends in sprawl
translates into a tripling of land area for each new
resident by 2030, converting on average some 160
square metres of non-urban to urban land.18 If past
trends hold, this invariably translates into more car-
dependent,  and  thus  inherently  less  sus tain able,
cities of the future.

Urban trans port as a factor increasing
urban sprawl
As  many  cities  worldwide  continue  to  experi ence
sprawl, built-up densities become lower. Trans port
has played an important role in the sprawl of cities.19
Indeed, the advent of low-cost urban trans port modes
– omnibuses, horse cars, trolleys, commuter trains
and later buses and cars – has accelerated the out -
ward  physical  expansion  of  cities,  making  density
declines possible.20 In the pre-automobile era, move -
ments within cities tended to be restricted to walking,
and urban forms compact, in order to reduce the need
for  physical  travel.  The  location  of  homes,  shops,
restaurants and even factories kept urban distances
short and walkable. However, extreme over crowd-
ing, lack of privacy and the overpowering stench of
manure  from  horse-drawn  carriages  forced  many
who had the means to escape. Streetcar cities, which
emerged and expanded with the devel op ment of elec -
trical power in most western cities, were heralded
as a triumph over the walking and horse-car city. This
is because they allowed the middle class to move to
lower  density  suburbs  and  escape  the  suffocating
urban densities of the early 1900s. Soon afterwards,
rail-served suburbs blossomed. Streetcars deﬁned the

radial spines of most regions, extending urban bound -
aries ﬁve-fold or more beyond those of the walking
city.21 The internal combustion engine car technology
developed  rapidly  during  the  twentieth  century, 
and with it came the advent of the automobile city.
The automobile city allowed devel op ment to ﬁll in
the wedges between radial corridors of the streetcar
city and metropolitan boundaries to extend outward
four to ﬁve times.22 The automobile city, and notably
the provision of grade-separated, limited-access free -
ways, further accelerated the dispersal of economic
activities,  unleashing  low-density,  discontinuous 
pat terns of urban growth associated with sprawl.23
Alongside  the  freeways  (among  other  factors),  a
more polycentric urban form was developed, marked
by shopping malls, ofﬁce parks, airports and other
major activity centres, congregated near major access
points.24

Seventy  years  ago,  a  noted  urban  sociologist
observed that urban form is largely a product of the
dominant  transportation  system  that  was  in  place
during a city’s prevailing period of growth.25 European
cities  such  as  London  (UK),  Madrid  (Spain)  and
Prague (Czech Republic) that grew, in relative terms,
most rapidly in the 1800s, retain many features of
walking and streetcar cities in their urban core. US
cities  such  as  Atlanta,  Los  Angeles,  and  Houston,
whose explosive periods of growth coincided with
the construction of freeways, by contrast, are sprawl -
ing  and  car  dependent.  This  increasingly  charac -
terizes  the  outskirts  of  Jakarta  (Indonesia),  Lagos
(Nigeria), São Paulo (Brazil) and many other cities in
devel op ing countries that are presently experiencing
rapid motorization and population growth. Further,
the  urgency  of  advancing  sus tain able mobility  and
urban-form  practices  in  rapidly  expanding  towns 
and cities of devel op ing countries, such as India and
China, is underscored.

Urban density and travel
Urban densities strongly inﬂuence travel. The impact
of densities on travel – and therefore, energy con -
sumption  and  natural  environ ments  –  gained
particular attention in the 1990s, in the wake of a
global energy crisis and economic recession. A 1989
cross-sectional  comparison  of  32  cities  showed
transport-related energy consumption declines pre -
cipitously  with  urban  densities  (Figure  5.3).26 US
cities averaged the lowest densities and nearly twice
the  petrol  consumption  per  capita  as  Australian
cities, around four times as much as more compact
European cities, and ten times that of three compact
Asian  cities  –  Hong  Kong,  Singapore  and  Tokyo.
These results were attributed to far higher usage and
kilometres  travelled  by  private  cars  in  sprawling
cities  than  in  compact,  public-transport-oriented
ones. Follow-up studies of 37 cities in 1999 found
similar  results:  low-density  cities  averaged  consid -
erably higher VKT per capita than high-density ones.27
Even  within  countries,  this  relationship  remains
strong. Panel studies of density and travel in the US
and the UK have associated the doubling of urban
densities with 15 per cent and 25 per cent declines
in  VKT  per  capita.28 However,  what  accompanies
density – e.g. lower car ownership rates, less road
space per capita, fewer and more expensive parking
and better quality public trans port services – can also
be  important  factors  associated  with  density.29 In
most instances, density is a necessary, though not a
sufﬁcient, condition for moderating private car use
and fuel consumption.

City-level studies such as shown in Figure 5.3
have  also  been  criticized  for  being  too  aggregate, 
thus  masking  variations  within  cities,  and  differ-
ences among subpopulations. However, even within
the same metropolitan area, substantial differences
in VKT per capita have been recorded. A study of

and San Francisco – found, after controlling house -
hold size, income effects and using odometer read -
ings,  that  car  ownership  and  use  declined  in  a
systematic and predictable pattern as a function of
increasing residential density.30 Similarly, evidence
suggests  a  negative  association  between  urban
densities and vehicular travel in other big cities that
are  rapidly  motorizing  including  Santiago  (Chile),
Beijing  (China),  Lisbon  (Portugal)  and  Moscow
(Russia).31 Once average density levels are reached,
the rate of drop-off tapers, offering a useful policy
guide  to  the  association  between  mobility  and 
urban form. For example, Hong Kong style high-rise
dens ities  are  not  needed  for  major  declines  in 
energy consumption and motorized movements to
be  achieved.  Rather,  going  from  very  low-density
sprawl (e.g. the suburbs of car-oriented Houston) to
modest  densities  of  town  homes  and  duplexes,
produces  the  biggest  declines  in  transport-sector
energy consumption and VKT.

The risk of potential self-selection bias is also
worth noting. Might less car travel be due to density
or  the  fact  that  those  who  walk  or  bike  more  in
compact,  mixed-use  neigh bour hoods  choose  such

places because of lifestyle and personal preferences?
One way to control for such possible effects is to
study changes in travel among individuals who moved
from one neigh bour hood type to another. A study
from Seattle, US, found that those moving to neigh -
bour hoods  with  higher  accessibility  (e.g.  dense,
mixed-use  settings  closer  to  other  destinations)
logged far fewer kilometres in vehicles.32 Further -
more, a recent review of 38 studies that statistically
controlled  for  self-selection  effects  revealed  that
virtually all studies found that built environ ments,
including  density  metrics,  still  had  statistically
signiﬁcant inﬂuences on travel.33

Other attributes of urban form
inﬂuencing travel
Density is but one element of urban form that inﬂu -
ences travel. The spatial distribution of population
and  employment  densities  are  also  important.34
Where people live, work, shop and socialize, sets the
stage for travel by deﬁning the location of trip origins
and destination, and thus the length of trips and the
energy they consume.

Density gradients – i.e. the rate at which dens -
ities taper with distance from the core – are another
way to represent urban form. Figure 5.4 shows that
densities fell sharply from the centres of Asian and
European  cities.  This  is  characteristic  of  a  mono-
centric or strong-centred metropolis. In contrast, the
density gradients of US cities are more ﬂat, revealing
a more sprawling, car-oriented urban form (even for
greater New York City). Higher densities in the core
than  the  outskirts  reﬂect  higher  market  demand, 
and higher real estate prices for more central and
accessible locations. The regulation of permissible

average, North American cities take up more than
twice as much land as Latin American cities, which
consume slightly more land than European, Asian and
African cities.

Tracing city footprints of Bandung (Indonesia)
and Accra (Ghana) reveals the types of land consumed
by new devel op ment in two fast-growing devel op ing-
country cities. Between 1991 and 2011, Bandung’s
urban footprint roughly doubled, from 108 to 217
square kilometres.37 Of the newly built-up area, 60
per cent consisted of urban expansion into farmland
and open space, 17 per cent was leapfrog or non-
contiguous devel op ment, and the rest was urban inﬁll
(i.e.  redevel op ment  of  existing  built-up  areas).
Leapfrog devel op ment can be costly to serve since
basic  infra struc ture,  such  as  sewerage  and  piped-
water, must be extended to far-ﬂung, outlying set -
tings. Overall, Bandung’s urban densities declined 1.4
per cent annually over this ten-year period. From 1985
to 2000, Accra’s land area grew 153 per cent, which
is twice as fast as its population growth. Accra’s urban
growth  consisted  largely  of  the  extension  of  city
boundaries into former agricultural areas.

Urban form and travel
Just as density inﬂuences the distances and modes
of travel, other attributes of urban form – including
the spatial distribution of population and employment
and land coverage – shape the spatial patterns of trips.
A monocentric urban form, wherein the vast majority
of jobs and commercial activities are concentrated
in the city centre and most households reside on the
periphery, mostly produces radial trips (Figure 5.6).
Whereas the convergence of vehicles near the centre
often gives rise to extreme road congestion, it also
allows for heavily patronized radial public trans port
networks to thrive. A multi-centred, or polycentric,
form results in more dispersed, lateral and cross-town
travel patterns, which generally favour ﬂexible forms
of mobility, such as private cars.38 Polycentric regions
can  mount  successful  public  trans port services  by

using  sub-centres  to  interlink  high-quality  and
synchronized rail services, such as those in Singapore
and  Paris.  Suburban  centres  and  nodes  effectively
become the interchange points for connecting large-
scale public trans port networks. The degree to which
station nodes average higher densities depends on
the larger shares of trips by non-motorized modes
such as walking and cycling.

Like densities, urban land coverage inﬂuences
travel. From 1980 to 2005, average kilometres driven
per person in the US increased by 50 per cent, a
change partly explained by the nearly 20 per cent
increase in land consumed per person over the same
period.39 In India, trip lengths are more inﬂuenced
by  land  area  (Figure  5.7)  than  by  urban  densities
(Figure  5.8).  Among  India’s  21  largest  cities,  the
relationship between population density and average
trip length is slightly positive. The slope of the plot
of urbanized land area and trip length, however, is
noticeably steeper. This reﬂects the sprawl-inducing
effect of ﬂoor space index (FSI) restrictions in the
urban cores of most Indian cities, used to decongest
the  centre.  Redirecting  growth  to  the  periphery
might  lessen  central-city  trafﬁc  congestion  at  the
expense  of  longer  distance  trips,  which  are  more
dependent on motorized trans port (including two-
and three-wheelers).

The larger the city, the greater its complexity
and the potential to inﬂuence future trafﬁc condi -
tions, particularly if not well managed. Larger cities
have  signiﬁcantly  higher  average  urban  densities
than smaller cities and thus higher trafﬁc densities
(e.g. vehicles travelling roads per square kilometre).
Between 1990 and 2000, a doubling of population
among 120 cities worldwide was associated with a
16 per cent increase in density.40 As city size and
spatial coverage increase, so do the average lengths
of trips, the severity of trafﬁc congestion and envir -
onmental pollution. Trafﬁc congestion is part of the
territory of megacities, regardless of the quality of
metro services.41 The rate of congestion growth is
also  increasing  rapidly  in  medium-sized  cities  that

Box 5.4 Mobility and over-concentrated devel op ment in Beijing, China

Beijing’s 2005 master plan called for the creation of 11 new
towns in peripheral regions of the city. The primary aim of
shifting growth to the outskirts has been to mitigate over -
crowding in the city’s central built-up area. The city has built a
total of seven ring roads in an attempt to connect the new
towns and divert trafﬁc from the city’s core. While new town
devel op ment embraced the idea of China’s capital city
becoming a polycentric one, Beijing’s urban form is
characterized as high-density monocentric, rather than multi-
centred. The city has witnessed a seemingly continuous
outward expansion from the central built-up area, with
densities tapering only slightly from the core. That is, the
region has become a high- to moderate-density devel op ment,
from the traditional core to the outskirts, with few dominant
centres.

The high and continuous concentration of urban

activities over a large geographic territory has led to extreme
trafﬁc congestion and air pollution. The fact that the city has
failed to create relatively self-functioning suburban clusters has
undermined its ability to develop cost-effective high-capacity
public trans port services, leading to high levels of car usage
and VKT per capita. Beijing’s failure to implement a multi-
centred urban form stems from the tendency for ring roads to
spread devel op ment evenly in all directions, from the
traditional core. Expanded rail investments and a policy
commitment to TOD – i.e. concentrating more growth
around metro stations – could give rise to a more clustered
pattern of suburban devel op ment in the future, with increased
mobility and environ mental beneﬁts.

High densities are

transport services

suffer from deﬁcient street layouts, poor connectivity
and inadequate public transport. These conditions are
further exacerbated when trafﬁc demand approaches
or  exceeds  the  available  capacity  of  the  trans port
system during peak hours. The expansion of cities
and high densities inevitably creates challenges in 
the  urban  environ ment,  particularly  in  devel op ing
countries. For example, the large concentration of
employment and economic activities, coupled with
inadequate  public  trans port in  megacities  such  as
Manila  (the  Philippines),  Lagos  (Nigeria),  Jakarta
(Indonesia)  and  Mexico  City,  have  resulted  in
exceedingly high trafﬁc densities, and comparatively
long trips by motorized transport.42

While  urban  agglomeration  allows  for  job
specialization,  efﬁcient  market  transactions  and
knowledge spillovers, if concentrated growth is not
well  planned  –  such  as  the  integration  of  urban
growth  with  metro  investments  –  the  resulting
economic beneﬁts tend to erode. Agglomeration dis -
economies – i.e. the inefﬁciency and loss resulting
from poorly planned concentrations – is expressed
in the form of lost labour productivity from extreme
trafﬁc  congestion,  increasing  air  pollution  and  an
overall decline in the quality of urban living. The over-
concentration of activities in the city’s urban core
has  been  blamed  for  Beijing’s  increasing  trafﬁc
congestion and environ mental problems (Box 5.4).
Evidence from recent studies conducted in UK cities
revealed  that  decongesting  the  core  by  dispersing
growth to sub-centres can raise economic produc-
tivity  without  increasing  transportation  energy 
use,  greenhouse  gas  emissions  and  air  pollution
levels.43

URBAN DENSITIES AND
PUBLIC TRANS PORT
THRESHOLDS
No aspect of urban form and travel has been more
closely studied than the inﬂuences of urban densities
on public trans port ridership. It is widely accepted
that high densities are essential for sustaining cost-
effective public trans port services. Mass transit, it is
said, needs ‘mass’, or density. As observed almost a
half-century  ago,  ‘nothing  is  so  conducive  to  the
relative economy of rail transit as high volumes and
population density. High population density increases
the  costs  of  all  urban  transportation  systems,  but
substantially less for rail than for other modes’.44 Rail,
with its high up-front capital costs and economies of
scale, needs to attain a threshold density of trips, in
order to cost less than accommodating the same trips
by car or bus. Since rail-based public trans port needs
high passen ger volumes to be cost-effective, it also
needs high concentrations of people and jobs around
stations.

Figure  5.9  indicates  a  relationship  between
public trans port ridership and urban form. Very low-
density cities with a predominantly polycentric form
are  unabashedly  autocentric.  In  spread-out  cities
such as Atlanta (US), public trans port has a difﬁcult
time competing with the private car. Public trans port
that is cost-effective can only be achieved through
high urban densities and a large share of jobs and
retail activities concentrated in the urban core (such
as in Shanghai, China), or in polycentric cities with
multi-directional travel patterns (such as Stockholm,
Sweden). Many large cities, such as Jakarta (Indo -
nesia) and Paris (France), lie somewhere between the
aforementioned extremes: both private mobility and
public trans port can compete for trips when densities

are moderately high and activities span the mono -

Figure  5.10  shows  that  there  is  a  positive
correlation  between  urban  population  density  and
public  trans port ridership  per  capita.  Hong  Kong, 
with extremely high densities, is a statistical outlier
– averaging comparatively low transit trips per capita
relative to its high densities. This maybe attributed
to the fact that many trip destinations are close to
each other, thereby resulting in an extraordinarily
high share of trips made by foot. Removing the Hong
Kong  case  from  the  database  produces  an  even
stronger statistical ﬁt.

The  reliance  of  public  trans port on  urban
densities has prompted efforts to deﬁne the minimum
density  thresholds  required  to  support  successful
public trans port services. On one hand, cities need
to average 3000 inhabitants per square kilometre to
support  reasonably  cost-effective  public  trans port
services.45 On the other hand, for wealthier, more
car-oriented countries such as the US, UK, Canada,
Australia and New Zealand, a minimum threshold of
3500  people  and  jobs  per  square  kilometre  is
necessary if public trans port is to generate sufﬁcient
ridership to cover costs.46 Evidence suggests that new
suburbs in these countries rarely achieve more than
half of this minimum threshold.47 A similar study in
Athens (Greece) found that public trans port trips per

capita sharply increased to 20,000 persons per square
kilometre and then tapered, suggesting this ﬁgure as
a  planning  norm  for  successful  public  trans port
services.48 While density thresholds have long been
set to guide public trans port investments and TOD
planning in the US, these benchmarks are based on
limited data points and experi ences (Box 5.5).

A  recent  US  study  examined  the  job  and
population densities that are associated with cost-
effective public trans port investments, based on the
country’s  experi ences  with  recent  light-rail  and 
BRT investments.49 Figure 5.11, which is based on
this study, shows that a BRT system that costs US$30
million per kilometre would need around 4000 jobs
and residents per square kilometre within 800 metres
of its station to be in the top 75 per cent of cost-
effective investments. A light-rail investment at the
same  per-kilometre  cost  requires  11,000  jobs  and
residents  per  square  kilometre;  and  a  heavy-rail
investment  requires  nearly  14,000  per  square
kilometre to fall in the top quartile.

However, as there are many city features that
inﬂuence public trans port ridership, some observers
have cautioned against a ﬁxation on density.50 The
walkability  and  land-use  mixes  of  neigh bour hoods
that surround stations are also important to viable
public transport services. If people cannot safely and
conveniently  walk  the  half  kilometre  to  or  from  a

Box 5.5 Density thresholds for cost-effective public trans port in the US

The devel op ment of minimum density thresholds for
successful public trans port investments in the US has been the
focus of numerous studies under taken and policy initiatives
introduced to the world’s most car-dependent country.
Between the 1960s and 1970s, it was estimated, that the high
costs of heavy-rail investment required a minimum net 
resi dential density of at least 3000 households per square kilo -
metre. A minimal light-rail investment, by comparison, would
require at least 2400 households per square kilometre. 
A more recent study of 59 capital investments in public trans -
port in the US since 1970, found light rail to be more cost-
effective than heavy rail, resulting in approximately 7000
people and jobs per gross square kilometre. Across these 
59 US projects, a 10 per cent increase in total pop ula tion and

jobs per square kilometre corresponded with a 3.2 per cent
decrease in annualized capital costs per rider.

While capital investment costs also rise with density, 

US experi ences show the increased ridership more than
offsets these costs per passen ger kilo metre. As a result, the
justiﬁcation for ﬁxed-guideway public trans port investments
has led to the adoption of density thresholds in US cities. The
city of San Diego, for instance, has adopted TOD guidelines
that call for a minimum of 6300 dwelling units per square
kilometre for light rail services serving urban transit-oriented
districts. In its TOD guidelines, metro Portland has set slightly
higher thresholds – 7500 dwelling units per square kilo metre
for devel op ment within one city block of light rail stations.

Jobs + population densities (per square kilometre)

Box 5.6 Dysfunctional densities of Los Angeles, US

The city of Los Angeles averages the highest overall population
density in the US matched by a thicket of criss-crossing
freeways and major arteries, which form a dense road
network. The city also averages the highest level of vehicular
travel per capita, and the worst trafﬁc congestion in the US.
This dysfunctional combination of high population and road
densities has been called the ‘worst of all worlds’ – because
trafﬁc congestion increases exponentially with car density and
city size; so do the externalities associated with car travel. 
The suburbs of Los Angeles are dotted with three to four

story walk-up garden-style apartments, horizontally stretched
within superblocks, creating long walking distances. Whereas
densities are high by US standards, they are not public
transport-oriented by European standards. In Los Angeles,
densities are generally too high for a car-dependent city and
are not organized along linear corridors in public transport-
friendly manner. Such population densities are too high for
cars and too poorly organized for successful public transport –
they are, in effect, dysfunctional densities.

station, chances are they will not use public trans -
port. Conversely, if they can easily run errands and
coordinate trips on the way to or from a station, they
are more likely to take public transport. Further, the
presence of a convenience retail store along the walk-
access corridor to a public trans port stop increases
the odds of public trans port riding.51 The manner in
which densities are designed also matter. Lineal and
well-articulated  densities  aligned  along  busways,
such  as  the  case  of  Curitiba  (Brazil),  are  far  more
conducive  to  public  trans port travel  than  the  uni -
formly spread-out, poorly planned densities in Los
Angeles, US (Box 5.6). Where there is a mismatch
between  the  geometry of  transportation  systems

(e.g. point-to-point rail systems) and the geography
of  travel  (e.g.  many  origins  to  many  destinations),
public  trans port will  struggle  to  grab  reasonable
market shares of trips regardless how good services
might be.52

Planning and Design for Sustainable Urban Mobility

Box 5.7 ‘Compact cities’ or ‘smart growth’

‘Compact cities’ or ‘smart growth’ are terms that have gained
currency in the ﬁeld of urban planning for describing urban
devel op ment that is compact, resource-efﬁcient and less
dependent on the use of private cars. The term of ‘smart
growth’ is most commonly used in North America, while in
Europe and Australia the term ‘compact city’ is often used to
connote similar concepts. As an antidote to sprawl, these
terms aim to reduce the municipal ﬁscal burden of
accommodating new growth, while at the same time
promoting walking and cycling, historical preservation, mixed-
income housing that helps reduce social and class segregation
and diversity of housing and mobility choices that appeal to a
range of lifestyle preferences. Ten accepted principles that
deﬁne such devel op ments have:

1  mixed-land uses;
2  compact building design;
3  a range of housing opportunities and choices;
4  walkable neigh bour hoods;
5  distinctive, attractive communities with a strong sense of

place;

6  preservation of open space, farmland, natural beauty and

critical environ mental areas;

7  devel op ment directed towards existing communities;
8  a variety of transportation choices;
9  devel op ment decisions that are predictable, fair and cost

effective;

10  community and stakeholder collaboration in devel op ment

decisions.

signature feature of ‘compact cities’ or ‘smart growth’
(Box 5.7).53 Successful integration means making the
connections between trans port and urban devel op -
ment work in both directions. As noted, the design
and layout of a city strongly inﬂuence travel demand.
At the same time, transportation infra struc ture is an
essential feature that shapes the city. The coordin -
ation and integration of trans port planning and devel -
op ment, as well as spatial planning and devel op ment
are key.

The coordinated planning of urban mobility and
land devel op ment starts with a collective vision of
the future city, shared by city govern ment and major
stakeholders of civil society. Thereafter, a strategic
plan that orchestrates urban devel op ment is devel -
oped to realize the shared vision, and must include,
among  other  things,  building  the  institutional,
regulatory and ﬁscal capacities to implement the plan.
A strategy plan aims to translate urban devel op ment
goals  into  long-range  implementation  in  terms  of
where and in what form devel op ment and redevel -
op ment occurs, and the tools (e.g. laws and regula -
tions,  ﬁscal  instruments,  organizational  reforms)
necessary  to  achieve  desired  outcomes.54 Vision-
ing the future city as a precursor to transportation
decision-making reﬂects the derived nature of travel.
People travel to reach places, and it is these places
that serve the purposes of trips and the aspirations
of people who make them. Well-planned cities, such
as  Singapore,  Stockholm  (Sweden)  and  Curitiba
(Brazil), crafted cogent visions of the future to shape
transportation  investments  and  achieve  the  best
outcomes, whether measured in economic prosperity,
energy  resourcefulness,  cleanliness  of  the  natural
environ ment or quality of life.55

The  city  of  Copenhagen  (Denmark)  and  its
celebrated ‘Finger Plan’ is a text-book example of a
long-term planning vision, which shaped rail invest -

ments and urban growth. A ﬁve-ﬁnger hand became
the  metaphor  for  deﬁning  where  growth  would 
and would not occur. Each ﬁnger was oriented to 
a  traditional  Danish  market  town  within  the  orbit 
of  metropolitan  Copenhagen.  The  construction  of 
rail-based  public  trans port was  purposed  to  steer
growth along the desired growth axes, in advance of
travel  demand.  Also,  greenbelt  wedges  set  aside 
as  agri cultural  preserves,  open  space  and  natural
habitats were designated and major infra struc ture was
directed away from the districts. 

Ottawa,  Canada,  with  a  population  under
900,000,  offers  a  good  example  of  concordance
between  urban  vision  and  transportation  invest-
ments.  The  1974  plan  called  for  a  multi-centred
urban  structure,  with  ﬁve  directional  corridors  of
future  growth  emanating  from  the  city  centre.
Ottawa’s  leaders  began  with  a  concept  plan  that
deﬁned desired growth axes, thereafter invested in a
high-quality,  high-capacity  busway  to  drive  growth
along  these  corridors.  A  combination  of  land-use
regula tions and incentives (e.g. targeted infra struc -
ture  invest ments)  channelled  commercial  and  em -
ployment growth to the busway corridors. The plan
 mandated, for example, that all shopping centres over
354,000 square metres gross leasable space had to be
sited near the busway or future extensions. Trans -
portation  demand  management  measures  such  as
mandatory parking charges were also introduced. In
2007,  Ottawa  adopted  guidelines  that  called  for
building designs and set-backs that create attractive
human-scale  devel op ment;  public  art  to  enliven
station areas; and short street blocks to make it easier
and more enjoyable for pedestrians to access busway
stations.56 Since 1990, the public transport’s mode
share in Ottawa has remained steady at 15 per cent
of  daily  trips,  while  declining  in  nearly  all  other
Canadian cities.57

The two examples above of where the urban-
form  ‘horse’  leads  the  transportation  ‘cart’,  with
trans port investments that have been used as tools
to create hoped-for outcomes. Similarly, local author -
ities can utilise a range of tools to inﬂuence urban
growth such as land-use regulations; infra struc ture
investments; tax policies (e.g. enterprise districts);
and  land  purchases  (e.g.  greenbelts).  However,
experi ence shows that transportation investments are
one of the most important.58 This is particularly the
case in fast-growing cities with vibrant economies,
worsening  trafﬁc  congestion  and  a  high  pent-up
demand for mobility. Arguably, ‘transport-land use
links are the most important ones in infra struc ture
plans and thus should take precedence’.59

Rather than being site or corridor speciﬁc about
where growth should take place, and in what form,
some  cities  opt  to  advance  principles  and  ideals,
expressed  in  fairly  general  terms,  about  desired
growth. This is often in the form of strategic spatial
plans that contain long-range directives and con cep -
tual ideas, as opposed to detailed spatial designs.60
An  example  is  Barcelona’s  recent  strategic  plan,
which calls for maintaining a compact urban form,
preserving  the  city’s  legacy  of  high-quality  urban
design  and  keeping  the  city  walkable.61 The  plan
provides a framework for this vision to be reﬁned and
set  into  motion,  through  a  series  of  local  multi-
sectoral projects, such as housing devel op ment and
brownﬁeld redevel op ment, as well as proactive invest -
ments in sus tain able transportation infra struc ture.62
With  a  population  similar  to  Atlanta’s,  Barcelona’s
longstanding commitment to planning and designing
a compact, mixed-use walkable city has produced a
spatial coverage and carbon footprint that is only a
fraction of Atlanta’s (Figure 5.12). The short distances
created by a compact city have meant that 20 per
cent of trips made by Barcelonans are by foot.63

In  devel op ing  countries,  long-term  strategic
plans  governing  the  growth  of  cities  tend  to  be 
less clearly deﬁned. In its ‘Accessible Ahmedabad’ 
plan, the city of Ahmedabad (India) embraced the
principle of creating a city designed for accessibility
rather  than  mobility,  without  speciﬁc  details  on 
the siting of new growth.64 The plan calls for guid-

ing devel op ment and investing in transportation so
as to: (1) reduce the need for travel; (2) reduce the
length of travel; and (3) promote the use of public
trans port and non-motorized vehicles to reduce car
dependence. The city’s BRT system forms the back -
bone  of  Ahmedabad’s  evolving  transportation  net -
work. A better articulation to urban devel op ment was
needed  to  make  ‘accessibility’  a  key  element  of
mobility and city growth.

Planning  the  accessible  city  also  involves
increasing the percentage of urban land allocated to
streets, to enhance connectivity. Studies show that
the overall connectivity of the city can be measured
by  proxy,  by  comparing  the  ratio  of  urban  land
allocated to streets with the total land area of the
city.65 Current trends indicate that the bulk of urban
population growth is occurring in devel op ing coun -
tries, most of which have a limited street and other
infra struc ture  required  for  increased  accessi bility.
While  it  is  important  for  these  cities  to  invest  in
streets, it should be noted, however, that having a
high percentage of urban land allocated to streets is
only the ﬁrst step in making a city more accessible.
There is, in addition, a need to take into account the
efﬁciency of the street system and its adaptability to
essential urban mobility modes such as high-capacity
public trans port systems (such as metros or BRTs),
walking  and  cycling.  An  efﬁciently  laid  out  street
system integrates three main variables, namely; the
proportion  of  land  area  allocated  to  streets,  the
number  of  street  intersections  and  the  distance
between  these  intersections.  Further more,  the
hierarchy – arterial, primary and secondary, as well
as  bikepaths  and  footpaths  –  of  the  street  system
constitutes  another  essential  element  of  the  con -
nectivity matrix for the city, which is a fundamental
aspect of accessible urban mobility systems.66 Each
city thus needs to invest in adequate and well-laid
out  street  networks,  according  to  its  economic,
institu tional, social and environ mental capacities.

Integrated mobility planning and urban growth
need to occur at multiple spatial scales – e.g. the
region  as  a  whole,  districts  and  corridors,  as  well 
as  neigh bour hoods.  Such  multi-level  planning  is  a
centrepiece of Portland, Oregon’s widely celebrated

approach  to  smart-growth  devel op ment.  There,  a
long-term  regional  vision  of  multiple,  hierarchical
growth centres, interlaced with high-quality public
trans port and secondary bikeway/pedway systems, has
been  adopted.  The  formation  of  an  urban  growth
boundary has been pivotal to Portland’s efforts to curb
urban sprawl, reduce car-dependence and create a
healthier, more liveable city. This boundary works
at the regional scale, ensuring that future growth is
inward and upward, not outward. The regional scale
best captures the ecological contexts in which cities
exist, and spatially corresponds to fragile resources
such  as  airsheds  and  water  tributary  areas.  The
district or corridor scale captures the spatial context
in  which  many  day-to-day  economic  transactions 
take place, such as going to work and shopping for
everyday items. For a public trans port corridor, say,
a necklace of pearls urban form (Figure 5.15) might
take  shape  wherein  nodes  of  mixed-use,  public
transport-served centres encourage residents to use
public trans port for their daily activities. In the case
of the neigh bour hood scale, activities such as con -
venience shopping, socializing with neigh bours and
walking  to  school  usually  take  place  where  urban
design approaches such as gridded street patterns and
TOD  are  targeted.  Spatial  harmonization  between
these three levels – regions, districts/corridors and
neigh bour hoods – can be crucial for the suc cess ful
integration  of  transportation  and  urban  devel op -
ment, as experi enced in Portland (US) and Curitiba
(Brazil).

The next three sections of this chapter refer to
each of these three scales, namely: neigh bour hoods,
corridors  and  regions.  In  addition,  the  directions 
of  the  transportation–urban  form  relationship  are
discussed at these scales. In particular, these sections

look at how urban devel op ment and land-use patterns
inﬂuence travel, and how transportation investments
and policies inﬂuence the growth and shape of the
city. Examples are cited that highlight the successes
and  challenges  of  integrating  transportation  and
urban devel op ment at each scale.

BUILT ENVIRON MENTS 
AND TRAVEL AT THE 
NEIGH BOUR HOOD SCALE
The  mobility  inﬂuences  of  ﬁner-grain  features  of 
the city – such as the size of city blocks, the layout
of  street  networks,  parking  arrangements  and  the
inter mixing  of  land  uses  –  are  best  measured  at 
the  neigh bour hood  scale.  Contemporary  forms  of
smart growth, such as TOD and new urbanism, both
discussed  in  the  next  section,  aim  to  place  many 
daily activities within a ﬁve to ten minute walk of
each other. This corresponds to the spatial coverage
of a typical neigh bour hood.

Many  studies  have  been  conducted  on  the
potential to reduce motorized travel through changes
in the built environ ment.67 Analysts often express
features  of  built  environ ments  along  ﬁve  core
dimensions or the ‘5 Ds’: density, diversity, design,
destination  accessibility  and  distance  to  transit 
(Box  5.8).  These  5  Ds  strongly  inﬂuence  travel
demand – notably, the number of trips made, the
modes chosen and the distances travelled – and are
evident  in  many  contexts  and  settings.68 Both
singularly and collectively, the 5 Ds affect VKT per
capita.

Box 5.8  5 Ds of built environ ments that inﬂuence travel

• Density gauges how many people, workers or built
structures occupy a speciﬁed land area, such as gross
hectares or residentially zoned land.

• Diversity reﬂects the mix of land uses and the degree to

which they are spatially balanced (e.g. jobs–housing
balance), as well as the variety of housing types and
mobility options (e.g. bikeways and motorways).

• Design captures elements such as street layout and

network characteristics that inﬂuence the likelihood of
walking or biking – e.g. pedestrian and bike-friendliness.
Street networks vary from dense urban grids of highly
interconnected, straight streets, to sparse suburban
networks of curving streets forming loops and 
lollipops.

• Destination accessibility measures ease of access to 
trip destinations, such as the number of jobs or other
attractions that can be reached within 30 minutes travel
time.

• Distance to transit is usually measured as the shortest

street routes from the residences or workplaces in an area
to the nearest rail station or bus stop.

These are not separate dimensions and indeed are often co-
dependent. Having high-rise housing and ofﬁce towers will
yield few mobility beneﬁts if the two activities are far from
each other. A diversity of uses and improved accessibility to
destinations from home or work are needed if denser devel -
op ment is to translate into more pedestrian and transit trips.
City downtown areas are considered the densest part of most
cities. They also tend to be the most diverse in terms of land
use and the most walkable – e.g. small city blocks, complete
sidewalk networks and ﬁne-grain grid street patterns.

master-planned British new town, Milton Keynes, and
the  more  traditional  Dutch  community,  Almere.70
Almere was designed for walking and cycling, while
Milton  Keynes  is  a  car-oriented  city  laid  out  on  a
super-grid  of  four-lane  thoroughfares,  separating
homes, ofﬁces and shops into different quadrants.
The study found that two-thirds of the out-of-home
trips  made  by  urban  residents  in  Milton  Keynes
were  by  car,  compared  to  42  per  cent  in  Almere. 
In  addition,  the  average  trip  distances  in  Almere 
were 25 per cent shorter. A more recent comparison
of  Milton  Keynes  with  another  Dutch  master-
planned  new  town,  Houten,  that  was  more  con -
sciously designed for bicycle travel revealed greater
differentials. In 2010, 55 per cent of all trips made
by Houten residents were by bike, as compared to
20 per cent of the trips made by urban residents in
Milton Keynes.71

While very little is known about the 5 Ds and
travel in devel op ing countries, evidence is beginning
to trickle in. In Santiago (Chile) evidence revealed
that between 1991 and 2001, the effect of urban
densities on car ownership doubled, with increasing
population  densities  reducing  the  likelihood  of
households owning a car.72 Being close to a subway
station also reduced car ownership rates. However,
land-use diversity had a minimal inﬂuence on travel.

employment and entertainment activities close to each 
other, for example, means the parking used by white-collar
employees during working hours can also be used in the
evenings and weekends by theatre-goers and restaurant
patrons. In such settings, co-locating land uses whose 
parking demands vary by the time and the day of week can
shrink the footprints of impervious parking surfaces by as
much as 35 per cent. Parking regulations and liability laws
might need to be adjusted to allow shared parking among
various activities in mixed-use settings.

Most evidence on this comes from developed
countries. A recent meta-analysis of more than 100
studies  in  North  America,  Table  5.1  shows  the
average inﬂuence of each D factor on VKT, expressed
as elasticities (denoting the per cent change in VKT
for a 1 per cent change in each D factor). The study’s
conclusion is that ‘destination accessibility’ is by far
the  most  important  land  use  factor  that  strongly
inﬂuences travel – on average, a doubling of access
to destinations (e.g. the number of jobs that can be
reached within 30 minutes by public transport) is
associated with a 20 per cent decline in VKT. Almost
any devel op ment in a central, accessible location will
generate less motorized travel than the best-designed,
compact,  mixed-use  devel op ment  in  a  remote
location.

Other attributes that inﬂuence travel include:
urban  design  (e.g.  street  connectivity  and  safe,
complete sidewalk provisions) and well-sited pedes -
trian  routes.  Box  5.9  describes  the  importance  of
land-use diversity such as level of mixing, which tends
to  exert  strong  inﬂuences  on  travel  modes  and
distances to the workplace, rather than the residential
end of trips. The rather weak statistical relationship
between density and travel in the US reﬂects the fact
that density is intertwined with other D variables –
e.g. dense settings commonly have mixed uses, small
city blocks, and central locations, all of which shorten
trips  and  encourage  walking.  While  individual
elasticities  might  appear  low  in  Table  5.1,  their
inﬂuences are additive.

European studies on the 5 Ds and travel, largely
corroborate US experi ences. As in the case of the
US, location within a region matters. Isolated neigh -
bour hoods  with  poor  accessibility  result  in  a  high 
level of car use. A study in Copenhagen, Denmark,
revealed that VKT increased by 30 per cent with a
doubling of distance to the city’s downtown area.69
The importance of road designs and land-use mixes
is revealed by a study of two European cities with
similar  land  areas  and  household  incomes  –  the

Box 5.9 Land-use diversity

Mixing up land uses can shorten trips and encourage non-
motorized travel. A recent study of six mixed-use activity
centres across the US found that 30 per cent of generated
trips were internal to the project – i.e. short journeys, mainly
by foot. Trips meant for private cars to external destinations
away from the devel op ment were instead on-site and often 
by foot. Such trips put no strain on the surrounding road
networks and generate relatively few vehicle kilometres of
travel. Unless such beneﬁts are accounted for in trafﬁc impact
studies, the trafﬁc-inducing impacts of mixed-use devel op -
ments become overstated.

Other beneﬁts of mixed land uses include opportunities
for shared parking and an even distribution of trips (and thus a

Planning and Design for Sustainable Urban Mobility

In Colombia, a study of Bogotá residents found that
while density and land-use diversity had very little
inﬂuence  on  the  amount  of  time  spent  walking 
and cycling, neigh bour hood design attributes such
as  street  connectivity  and  sidewalk  provisions  had
signiﬁcant  impacts.73 Moving  from  a  neigh bour-
hood in Bogotá with low levels of road connectivity
(measured by the ratio of links to intersections) to
higher  levels,  resulted  in  an  increased  likelihood 
(by 220 per cent) that residents walked 30 minutes
or  more  per  day.74 Many  of  Bogotá’s  older  neigh -
bourhoods that evolved organically during the pre-
car era had strict zoning laws, thereby resulting in
urban neigh bour hoods that exhibit similar densities,
mixes of land use and access to public transit. The
quality of the walking environ ment varied, however,
and did not strongly inﬂuence non-motorized travel.
Similarly,  in  Taipei  and  Hong  Kong  (China)  street
designs tend to strongly inﬂuence walking, as com -
pared to high densities and mixed land uses (which
are commonplace in both cities).75

The  quality  of  the  walking  environ ment  has
important age and gender dimensions. In Teheran,
a  recent  study  found  highly  walkable  neigh bour -
hoods to be most conducive to the elderly, resulting
in their walking more often.76 Environ ments designed
with  more  street  lighting  and  a  mixture  of  land 
uses that generate foot trafﬁc are likely to decrease
the risk of violence to women.77 Further, people of
all ages and genders tend to socialize more and are
physically active in compact, mixed-use neigh bour -
hoods.78 Well-designed streetscapes with destinations
close by tend to draw city residents to sidewalks and
public  spaces,  creating  what  urban  designers  call
‘natural surveillance’ and more ‘eyes on the street’.79
Bogotá’s proactive investment in walkways, plazas and
sidewalks close by, and the city’s connection to the
Transmilenio BRT system has further enhanced public
safety and encouraged households to upgrade their
homes and neigh bour hoods.80

Expanded,  improved  and  better  connected
pathways are important features of slum upgrading
programmes.  In  La  Vega  Barrio,  one  of  Caracas,
Venezuela’s largest and oldest informal settlements,
30  pathways  that  criss-cross  steep  hillsides  have
been built or rehabilitated to enhance access to jobs,
schools and medical clinics, as part of a major neigh -
bour hood  upgrading  initiative.81 Design  features 
such as smaller city blocks can also encourage foot
travel  in  devel op ing  cities.  Smaller  blocks  mean 
that trips made by foot are likely to be less circuitous.
In Ahmedabad, India, only 13 per cent of trips made
by those living in neigh bour hoods with an average
block size of 4 hectares, were by foot, compared to
the recorded 36 per cent in a similar neigh bour hood,
with average block sizes of 1.2 hectares.82

Experi ences from China reveal how changes in
built  environ ments  fundamentally  change  travel 
in rapidly growing settings. Paralleling China’s shift

to a market economy have been dramatic transform -
ations  of  urban  environ ments  –  from  a  traditional
high-density, pedestrian- and cyclist-oriented urban
form  to  an  increasingly  spread-out,  auto-oriented
one.83 The liberalization of land markets in the 1990s
resulted  in  the  displacement  of  many  Chinese
working-class households to the periphery – often
to  isolated  superblock  devel op ment  enveloped  by
wide streets.84 The change from organ ically evolved,
mixed-use  enclaves  –  where  many  people  lived,
worked  and  shopped  in  the  same  area  –  to  car-
ori ented large-block suburbs, dramatic ally enlarged
households’ travel footprints. A study on the travel
impacts of 900 households that moved from Shang -
hai’s urban core to isolated, superblock and gated
housing  units  on  the  periphery  revealed  dra matic
shifts from non-motorized to motorized travel and
journeys  of  far  longer  duration.  This  resulted  in  a 
50 per cent increase in VKT from the households
surveyed.85 Another  study  found  that  residents 
living  in  higher-density  areas  in  Shanghai,  with 
smaller blocks and denser street networks averaged
around  one-half  of  the  car  ownership  levels,  com-
pared  to  the  urban  residents  living  in  more  car-
oriented, superblock districts.86 Moreover, residents
of pedestrian/cycle-friendly neigh bour hoods travelled
shorter  distances  than  those  of  other  neigh bour -
hoods, even in cases whereby the travel mode was
the same.

Globally,  various  neigh bour hood  designs  and
retroﬁts are being introduced to reduce the need for
travel  by  private  cars  and  invite  more  sus tain able
forms of mobility. Among these are: traditional neigh -
bour hoods, also known as new urbanism; TOD; and
car-restricted districts.

Traditional neigh bour hoods and the new
urbanism
Before  the  advent  of  the  private  car,  traditional
neigh bour hoods  were  compact  and  highly  walk-
able.  Daily  activities  (e.g.  shops,  restaurants  and
schools) that were no more than ﬁve minutes away
were  characteristic  of  the  pre-automobile  era.87
In  the  early  1980s,  an  urban  design  movement,
called ‘new urbanism’, was developed in the US. This
movement  sought  to  return  neigh bour hoods  to 
their pre-automobile designs and ambiances – places
that  promoted  walking,  allowed  daily  face-to-face
interaction of people from all walks of life and pro -
vided a range of housing types, workplaces, commer -
cial-retail offerings and public places.88 Diversity and
place-making became catchwords of the movement.89
In contrast to the sameness and sterility of suburban
sprawl, new urbanism emphasized the ﬁne details of

More  than  600  new  urbanism  neigh bour-
hoods have been built, planned or are under con struc -
tion in the US.91 Most notable is Seaside, Florida,
that was launched in the early 1980s. In Europe, a
number  of  former  brownﬁeld  sites  have  been
redeveloped since the 1980s, based on traditional
versus  modernist  design  principles.  One  example 
is  Poundbury,  England,  on  the  outskirts  of  Dor-
chester.92 Other  notable  European  new  urbanism
communities  already  built  or  taking  form  include
Heulebrug (Belgium), Pitiuosa (Greece), Agelada de
Cima (Portugal), Hardelot Plage (France) and Kemer
in Istanbul (Turkey). In devel op ing countries, recent
examples of neigh bour hood designs and redevel op -
ment projects that follow new urbanism principles
to varying degrees are Orchid Bay (Belize), Rosetown
outside of Kingston (Jamaica), Timphu (Bhutan) and
Melrose  Arch  in  Johannesburg  (South  Africa).93
However, these projects mainly cater for the middle-
or high-income households that can afford the neigh -
bour hood amenities (e.g. civic squares, streetscape
enhancements, etc.) that accompany new urbanist
communities.  Accordingly,  they  have  contributed
little to relieving deeply entrenched social problems
such as slums and concentrated poverty.

Among  the  objectives  for  designing  com -
munities, like those proposed by new urbanism, is
that there will be a reduction in car dependence by
making  the  communities  pleasant  places  to  walk 
and cycle. Experi ence largely bears this out.94 In the
Research  Triangle  area  of  North  Carolina  a  study
found  that  VKT  reductions  were  due  to  the  sub -
stitution of out-of-neigh bour hood car trips for within-
neigh bour hood walk trips.95 At similar income levels,
those living in compact, mixed-use ‘traditional’ neigh -

bour hoods made as many daily trips as those in low-
density,  single-family  suburban  neigh bour hoods.
However the switch from driving to walking and the
shortening of trip distances resulted in around 20
per cent fewer VKT per household each weekday.

Transit-oriented devel op ment (TOD)
TOD is traditional or new urbanism devel op ment that
is physically oriented to a public trans port station.96
By concentrating a mix of pedestrian-oriented devel -
op ment  around  public  trans port nodes,  residents
and workers are more likely to catch a train or a bus
for out-of-neigh bour hood trips, and walk or bike for
shorter within-neigh bour hood trips.97 TODs aim to
function  as  community  hubs,  and  places  where
people not only ‘pass through’ but also choose ‘to
be’ – e.g. for public celebrations and demonstrations,
outdoor  concerts,  farmers’  markets  and  other
activities that help build community (Box 5.10).98 If
there is a logical place to concentrate urban growth
and redevel op ment, it is around public trans port stops
– an idea that planners, politicians and lay-citizens
alike  understand.  Of  course,  high-quality,  well-
connected  public  trans port service  must  exist  to
draw passen gers to the station area in the ﬁrst place,
thus  TOD  relies  on  and  implicitly  assumes  public
trans port is safe, reliable and time-competitive with
the private car.99

Increasingly,  TOD  is  globally  recognized  as  a
viable model for shaping urban growth. TOD is most
fully developed in Europe, and particularly in Scandi -
navia.  Step  one  in  making  TOD  a  reality  is  the
formulation of a vision and conceptual image of the
future metropolis, such as Copenhagen’s celebrated
‘ﬁnger plan’ and Stockholm’s ‘necklaces of pearls’
(Figure  5.16).  In  both  these  cities,  corridors  for
channelling overspill growth from the urban centres

Box 5.10  Transit-oriented devel op ment

The term TOD refers to compact, mixed-use, pedestrian-
friendly devel op ment that is ‘oriented’, and not just adjacent
to, urban rail and busway stations. Besides being the ‘jumping
off’ point for catching a train or bus, TOD also serves other
community purposes. In the Scandinavian model, TOD is
characterized by a large civic square that functions as a
community’s hub – a gathering place for public events, such as
open-air concerts, farmers’ markets, public demonstrations
and civic celebrations. Thus, TOD can serve both functional
and symbolical purposes, as the centrepiece of communities.
Experi ence shows that the Scandinavian approach to TOD
designs can have signiﬁcant beneﬁts to communities such as:
increasing public trans port ridership; providing mobility
choices; increasing public safety; reducing air pollution and
energy consumption rates; building social capital; and
increasing commerce and economic activities.

were deﬁned early in the planning process, and rail
infra struc ture was built, often in advance of demand,
to steer growth along desired growth axes.

Traditionally, few cities in devel op ing countries
were public-trans port oriented, featuring ﬁne-grain
mixes of land uses, plentiful pathways for pedestrians
and  cyclists,  and  ample  transit  services  on  major
roads. In Latin America, TOD is being planned or has
taken form to varying degrees around BRT stations
in Curitiba (Brazil), Santiago (Chile) and Guatemala
City. Other noteworthy experi ences with bus-based
TOD can be found in Asian cities such as Kaoshiung,
Qingdao  and  Jiaxing  (China)  and  Kuala  Lumpur
(Malaysia).

Many cities in China are looking to TOD in order
to manage growth and capitalize upon massive rail
and BRT investments. Recently, Beijing and Guang -
zhou adopted TOD as a guiding design principle in
their long-range master plans.100 However, failure to
articulate  densities  (e.g.  tapering  building  heights
with distances from stations), the siting of stations
in isolated superblocks and poor pedestrian access
have  undermined  TOD  efforts  in  many  Chinese
cities.101 Over the past two decades, Beijing’s invest -
ment  in  a  massive  372-kilometre  subway  metro
network has seen housing projects gravitate to rail
corridors  outside  of  the  urban  core,  with  a  few 
jobs and consumer services following suit.102 Many
rail-served  neigh bour hoods  have  become  veritable
dormitory  communities,  skewing  commuting  pat -
terns. A study of three residential neigh bour hoods
in  Beijing’s  rail-served  northern  suburbs  found  as
many as nine times the number of rail passen gers
heading inbound in the morning peak as those rail
passen gers heading outbound.103 In addition, poor
integration of station designs with the surrounding
devel op ment  has  produced  chaotic  pedestrian
circulation  patterns  and  long  passen ger  queues  at
suburban stations.104

Evidence on how TOD has inﬂuenced travel and
environ mental quality  comes  mainly  from  the  US.
There, studies show that TODs can reduce car use
per  capita  by  half,  thus  saving  households  around 
20  per  cent  of  their  income  since  they  have,  on
average,  one  less  car  or  often  none.105 Typically, 
TOD resi dents in the US commute by transit four 
to ﬁve times more than the average commuter in a
region.106 Similar  ridership  bonuses  have  been
recorded for TOD projects in Toronto, Vancouver,
Singapore  and  Tokyo.107 In  China,  a  recent  study
found smaller differen tials of around 25 per cent in
rail commuting between those living near versus away
from suburban rail stations.108

While  TOD  planning  tends  to  focus  on  resi -
dences, experi ence from the US shows that concen -
trating  jobs  around  rail  stops  in  well-designed,
pedestrian-friendly settings can exert even stronger
inﬂuences  on  the  choice  of  travel  mode.109 The
location of TOD in a region and the quality of con -

necting public trans port services can strongly inﬂu -
ence the choice of travel mode. A TOD as an island
in a sea of auto-oriented devel op ment will have little
inﬂuence on travel.

Trafﬁc-calmed and car-restricted 
neigh bour hoods
Many European cities have brought liveability and
pedestrian safety to the forefront of transportation
planning. Initiatives have sought to tame and reduce
dependence  on  the  private  car.110 Trafﬁc  calming 
is one such example, pioneered by Dutch planners
who  have  added  speed  humps,  realigned  roads,
necked  down  intersections  and  planted  trees  and
ﬂowerpots  in  the  middle  of  streets  to  slow  down
trafﬁc. With trafﬁc calming, the street becomes an
extension of a neigh bour hood’s liveable space – a
place to walk, chat and play. Car passage becomes
secondary. After trafﬁc calming its streets in the early
1990s, the city of Heidelberg, Germany, witnessed
a 31 per cent reduction in accidents and 44 per cent
fewer casualties.111

An even bolder policy in the same direction has
been  the  outright  banning  of  cars  from  the  core 
of  traditional  neigh bour hoods  and  districts,  com -
plemented  by  an  upgrading  and  beautiﬁcation  of
pedestrian spaces. This practice has become common -
place in many older European cities, whose narrow
and winding inner-city streets were not designed for
motorized trafﬁc. Today, car-free historical districts
thrive  in  Athens  (Greece),  Seville  (Spain),  Lübeck 
and Bremen (Germany), Bologna and Siena (Italy) and
Bruges (Belgium), as well as substantial portions of
university towns such as Groningen and Delft (the
Netherlands), Oxford and Cambridge (UK) and Frei -
burg and Münster (Germany). Extended pedestrian-
only  shopping  streets  and  promenades  have  also
gained  popularity,  such  as  Copenhagen’s  Strøget
(Denmark), Lisbon’s Baixa (Portugal) and Gamla Stan
in old town Stockholm (Sweden). Similarly, multi-
block car-free streets and enhanced pedestrian zones
are also found in devel op ing-country cities, including
Curitiba, Brazil (20 city blocks), Buenos Aires, Argen -
tina (12 blocks of Florida Street and several car-free
waterfront  redevel op ment  projects),  Guadalajara,
Mexico (15 downtown streets) and Beirut, Lebanon
(much  of  the  historical  core).  Entire  residential
communities,  either  newly  built  or  redeveloped, 
that are car-restricted can be found such as Vauban
(Box 7.12) and Rieselfeld outside of Freiburg (Ger -
many), Amsterdam’s GWL Terrein brownﬁeld redevel-
opment (the Netherlands), Vienna’s Mustersiedling
Floridsdorf  housing  project  (Austria),  Munich’s
Kolumbus platz  neigh bour hood  (Germany),  the
Stellwerk  60  project  in  Cologne  (Germany)  and
Masdar  City  outside  of  Abu  Dhabi  (United  Arab
Emirates).112

Some  European  communities  have  opted  for
trafﬁc calming measures using cellular neigh bour hood
designs that require motorists to follow round-about
routes, while providing direct connections to cyclists
and pedestrians when going from one cell to another.
One example is Houten, a master-planned, largely
bedroom  community  of  41,000  inhabitants  south 
of Utrecht (the Netherlands), which was designed
and built to prioritize travel by bicycle and walking.
Despite  some  initial  uneasiness  by  business  mer -
chants, residents and politicians, global experi ences
with creating car-free districts, auto-restricted neigh -
bour hoods and pedestrian-only streets have generally
been positive. However, consideration needs to be
made to ensure that high-quality and frequent public
trans port services are in place to absorb displaced
car trafﬁc. A study of pedestrianization in German
cities recorded increases in pedestrian ﬂows, public
trans port ridership,  land  values  and  retail  sales
transactions  (Table  5.2),  as  well  as  property  con -
versions  to  more  intensive  land  uses,  matched  by
fewer trafﬁc accidents and fatalities.113 A study of over
100 cases of road-capacity reductions (e.g. car-free
zones, pedestrian-street conversions as well as street
and bridge closures) in developed countries found
an average overall reduction in motorized trafﬁc of
25  per  cent,  even  after  controlling  for  possible
increased travel on parallel routes. This ‘evaporated’
trafﬁc represented a combination of people forsaking
low-value, discretionary trips and opting for alterna -
tive modes, including public transport, walking and
cycling.114

CORRIDOR CONTEXTS
A transportation ‘corridor’ consists of ‘one or more
primary  transportation  facilities  that  constitute  a
single  pathway  for  the  ﬂow  of  people  and  goods
within and between activity centers, as well as the
abutting land uses and supporting street network’.115
Corridors  represent  the  spatial  context  in  which
signiﬁcant  challenges  are  often  faced  in  coordin-
ating  transportation  and  land  devel op ment  across
multiple jurisdictions. They are also where ‘access

management’ – trading off the mobility versus site-
access functions of roads – can pose signiﬁcant policy
challenges,  particularly  in  fast-growing  cities  and
regions.116 If well planned and designed, corridors
also present a spatial context for designing a network
of TODs.

Mobility and devel op ment trade-offs
Transportation  corridors  function  to  move  people 
and goods but often face intense devel op ment pres -
sures that over time can erode their mobility func -
tion.117 Experi ences show that building motorways
without carefully managing urban growth is a sure-
ﬁre recipe for future trafﬁc tie-ups.118 This is par -
ticularly the case of devel op ing country cities. New
roadways open up access to new territories, spawn-
ing  building  construction  and  land  devel op ment 
and thus more trafﬁc.119 In Sub-Saharan Africa, road
improvements have stimulated the local production
of  cash  crops,  spurring  urbanization  in  secondary
towns  where  farmers  sell  their  products  and  buy
services and imported goods.120 Access to port cities
is especially crucial since most African trade is trans -
oceanic. A study of 287 cities in 15 African countries
found that cities relatively closer (465 kilometres)
to a major port via paved roads grew 6 per cent faster,
between  2002  and  2008,  than  otherwise  similar
cities.121 Another study of proposed road upgrades
between northeast Congo and the Central African
Republic estimated that, in addition to stimulating
urban  growth,  goods  traded  via  this  route  would
increase from a current value of US$16 million to
US$142  million,  nearly  800  per  cent  increase.122
The study concluded that trade expansion promoted
by  the  upgrading  would  exceed  costs  by  about
US$220 billion over a period of 15 years.

With time, induced economic growth and new
urbanization generates new trips, congesting road -
ways. Unless such growth is properly managed, eco -
nomic  and  urbanization  beneﬁts  will  diminish.123
Effectively,  the  roadway’s  role  and  function  trans -
forms from one of providing mobility to providing 
site access (Figure 5.14). The two are in fundamental

conﬂict. High corridor access, marked by frequent
driveways, curb cuts and slow-moving cars accessing/
exiting  sites  interferes  with  through-trafﬁc  move -
ments. Further, travel speeds decline and accident
levels  increase.  The  problem  is  often  accentuated
when  different  institutions  control  infra struc ture
and land devel op ment along the corridor. If a national
govern ment or state builds a new road to improve
cross-city trafﬁc ﬂows, the intention of local govern -
ments is to take advantage of the added capacity by
allowing new devel op ment – a means to grow the
local economy and generate property tax income.124
Such  scenarios  whereby  localities  exploit  newly
provided roadway infra struc ture, in order to leverage
new growth and increase tax revenues at the expense
of intercity mobility, are particularly problematic in
parts of Sub-Saharan Africa and South-Eastern Asia.125
One approach to mitigating unintended conse -
quences is improved corridor access management.126
This  can  be  done  through  growth  management, 
road designs, price signals or other policy instruments
(e.g. license-plate restrictions on travel). An example
of  a  road-design  response  is  the  construction  of
frontage roads that separate through-moving trafﬁc
from local, slower-moving trafﬁc. This is a common
practice in North America and Europe. Front roads

and auxiliary lanes are common in wealthier countries
where sufﬁcient rights of way have been preserved
to accommodate them. However, these can be difﬁ -
cult to build in Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia because
of land constraints. Limited-access toll-ways can also
be built to allow those willing to pay for travel-time
savings to avoid local congestion.127

In  lieu  of  supply-side  corridor-management
responses (e.g. construction of frontage roads and
curb-cut restrictions), corridor-level growth manage -
ment plans that link land use to new or expanded
improvements  can  also  be  developed.  Both  land
devel op ment and trans port infra struc ture need years
for implementation. Therefore, coordinated and strat -
egic long-range planning is essential. Once a trans -
port investment is committed and land-use policies
are adopted, the two can co-evolve over time.

Freeways  and  rail  systems  can  complement
rather than compete with each other through multi-
modal corridor planning and design.128 In the suburbs
of Munich (Germany), suburban trains and motor -
ways are physically integrated to allow motorists to
efﬁciently  switch  to  trains.  Large  digital  screens
inform motorists of downstream trafﬁc speeds and
expected travel times for reaching the city centre via
train.129

Public transport-oriented corridors
Some cities have directed land uses that are scattered
throughout suburbia – e.g. housing, ofﬁces, shops,
restaurants,  strip  malls  –  to  corridors  served  by
public transport.130 Scandinavian cities such as Stock -
holm (Sweden), Helsinki (Finland) and Copenhagen
(Denmark) have created networks of linked TODs 
–  that  is,  public  transport-oriented  corridors.  This
‘necklace of pearls’ built form (Figure 5.15) not only
induces public trans port riding but can also produce
balanced, bi-directional ﬂows (and thus more efﬁcient
use of infra struc ture) through land-use intermixing.
While  some  stations  have  a  balance  of  land  uses,
others  are  more  specialized,  functioning  as  either
employment  centres  or  residential  communities.
However, within the 10–15 kilometre linear corridors
served by rail, one ﬁnds a balance of jobs, housing,
retail and population services. Consequently, there
are  multi-directional  ﬂows  of  trafﬁc  during  peak
hours.  Public  trans port  is  efﬁciently  used  in  both
directions, rather than the asymmetrical ﬂows found
in imbalanced settings.

Greater  Stockholm  has  evolved  along  public
transport-oriented  corridors.  During  the  last  half-
century, strategic regional planning has given rise to
regional  settlement  and  commutation  patterns 
that  have  substantially  lowered  car-dependency  in
Stockholm’s  middle-income  suburbs.131 The  city’s
investment  in  radial  rail  lines  has  produced  a
necklace-of-pearls urban form and a balanced use of
land for work and housing. A number of mixed-use

neigh bour hoods dot the region’s extensive radial rail
network, interspersed by lower-density devel op ment
and open space (Figure 5.16). Stockholm planners
consciously created jobs–housing–retail balance along
rail-served axial corridors, leading to a high share of
trips  self-contained  within  sub-regional  corridors,
and  a  directional  balance  of  travel  ﬂows  during 
peak hours. Less cross-hauling from one quadrant of
the  region  to  another  has  reduced  trafﬁc  burdens 
on the region’s transportation networks and ration -
alized  travel  ﬂows  to  produce  short-to-moderate
distance trips that are well served by railway and fast-
bus services. This has resulted in high modal splits
for public trans port (higher than in larger rail-served
cities such as Berlin, Germany; and London, UK) and
comparatively low CO2 emissions per capita in the
trans port sector (lower than Tokyo, Japan; New York,
US; and Rome, Italy).132 Most residents in Stockholm
use  public  trans port to  commute  to  work,  and
selectively use private cars for grocery shopping or
when travelling on long weekend excursions.

Curitiba,  Brazil,  one  of  the  world’s  most  sus-
tain able,  well-planned  cities,  is  another  text-book
example of successful public transport-oriented corri -
dors,  albeit  using  a  lower-cost  public  trans port
technology  than  in  Stockholm,  namely:  BRT.  By
emphasizing  planning  for  people  rather  than  cars,
Curitiba has evolved along well-deﬁned radial axes
lineal corridors that are intensively served by dedi -
cated  busways.  Along  some  corridors,  streams  of

double-articulated  buses  haul  16,000  passen gers 
per hour, comparable to what much pricier metro-
rail systems carry. The city’s current system of 390
routes served by 2000 vehicles carries 2.1 million
passen gers per day, double the count of 15 years ago.
To  ensure  a  public  transport-oriented  built  form,
Curitiba’s govern ment mandates that all medium- and
large-scale urban devel op ment be sited along a BRT
corridor.

A design element used to enhance accessibility
and ensure balanced corridor growth in Curitiba is
the ‘trinary’ – three parallel – roadways with com -
patible land uses and building heights that taper with
distance from the BRT corridor (Figure 5.17). Zoning
ordinances  and  urban  design  standards  promote
ridership  productivity  and  environ mental quality.
The ﬁrst two ﬂoors of buildings along the busway 
– which do not count against permissible plot ratios
(building  height/land  area)  –  are  devoted  to  retail
uses. Above the second ﬂoor, buildings must set back
at least 5 metres from property line to allow sun to
cast  on  the  busway.  The  inclusion  of  upper-level
housing entitles property owners to density bonuses,
leading  to  vertical  mixing  of  uses  within  build-
ings.  Further,  the  higher  densities  produced  by 
the trinary design have resulted in increased rider-
ship.  Con centrated  commercial  devel op ment  has
also  chan nelled  trips  from  residences  beyond  BRT
terminuses  to  the  trinary  corridors.  In  2009,  for
example, 78.4 per cent of trips boarding at the ter -

that when densities increase, so does public trans -
port ridership. In addition, the mixing of land uses
along the trinary corridors has produced bi-directional
ﬂows, ensuring efﬁcient use of bus capacity.

The mobility and environ mental beneﬁts from
Curitiba’s  three-plus  decades  of  integrated  devel -
opment  along  public  trans port corridors  are  well
celebrated. Curitiba has Brazil’s highest public trans -
port mode splits (45 per cent), the lowest congestion-
related  economic  losses  and  lowest  rate  of  urban 
air  pollution  (despite  being  an  industrial  city).134
On  a  per  capita  basis,  Curitiba  is  one  of  Brazil’s
wealth iest cities, yet it averages considerably more
public-trans port  trips  per  capita  than  much-bigger 

Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo.135 In 2005, Curitiba’s
VKT per capita (7900) was only half as much as in
Brazil’s national capital Brasília, a city with a similar
popula tion  size  and  income  level  but  a  sprawl-
ing, autocentric built form.136 Based on 2002 data,
Curitiba’s  estimated  annual  congestion  cost  per
capita of US$0.67 is only a fraction of São Paulo’s
(US$7.34).137 The strong, workable nexus that exists
between Curitiba’s bus-based public trans port system
and its mixed-use linear settlement pattern deserves
most of the credit.

Sustained  political  commitment  has  been  an
important  part  of  Curitiba’s  success.  The  harmon -
ization of trans port and land use took place over 40
years  of  political  continuity,  with  forward-looking,
like-minded mayors who built on the work of their
predecessors.138 A cogent long-term vision and the
presence of a semi-autonomous municipal planning
organization139 to implement the vision have been

crucial in allowing the city to chart a sus tain able urban
pathway.

In recent years, Curitiba has begun to experi -
ence  the  limits  of  rubber-tire  technologies.  With
buses  operating  on  30-second  intervals  on  main
routes during the peak hour, bunching problems have
disrupted and slowed services. Veritable elephant-
trains of buses have increased operating costs and
precluded the kinds of economies of scale enjoyed
by single-driver operated trains. Extreme over crowd -
ing has prompted many middle-class choice travellers
to switch to driving.140 A long-discussed light-rail line,
to  replace  over crowded  buses,  has  yet  to  gain
momentum due to cost concerns.141

Curitiba has also been criticized for giving short
shrift to intermodal connections to BRT corridors.
Only six of the city’s 22 BRT stations, for example,
are connected by dedicated bicycle paths, which is
a smaller share than Bogotá’s Transmilenio BRT.142

REGIONAL CONTEXT
Cities  have  grown  and  spilled  beyond  their  walls 
and jurisdictional boundaries for centuries. However,
the  devel op ment  of  city  clusters  and  large  urban
agglomerations is more recent. The modern approach
to  new  town  devel op ment  began  with  Ebenezer
Howard’s  concept  of  the  ‘Garden  City’  in  1898,
leading to the evolution of Letchworth and Welwyn
Garden City.143 This devel op ment was followed by
the  UK  new  towns  movement  in  the  late  1940s,
which has since been emulated in many countries,
particularly in the building of new national capitals
such  as  Canberra  (Australia),  Dodoma  (Tanzania)
and New Delhi (India), which are designed as cluster
or regional cities. Many countries, especially China,
have  adopted  new  towns  as  the  preferred  plan-
ning approaches previously adopted in European and
US cities.144 For example, Shanghai has developed
extensive  plans  for  its  metropolitan  region.  Other
Asian  cities,  such  as  Delhi  (India),  Kuala  Lumpur
(Malaysia)  and  Jakarta  (Indonesia),  are  perusing 
new town approaches to the planning and devel op -
ment of their region based on clusters. Navi Mumbai,
adjacent  to  the  Indian  city  of  Mumbai,  is  being
planned as the largest new town in the world.145 Latin
American cities such as Buenos Aires (Argentina), Rio
de Janeiro (Brazil), Santiago (Chile) and Mexico City
have also adopted new town approaches to regional
devel op ment based on clusters. The concept of city
cluster devel op ment was applied to the planning of
Abuja (Nigeria) and Brasília (Brazil), Shanghai (China),
Mumbai  (India)  and  Hanoi  (Viet  Nam),  promoting
cross-river expansion into new urban growth areas.
Growth triangles, such as in Singapore, Jahor Baru
(Malaysia)  and  Bintan  (Indonesia),  and  Shenzhen,
Hong  Kong  and  Macau  (China),  are  examples  of
network  planning  approaches  based  on  a  regional
agglomeration concept.

Connectivity and large urban
conﬁgurations
Cities of different sizes have increasingly started to
merge  and  form  new  spatial  conﬁgurations  that
typically take three principal forms, namely: mega-
regions,  urban  corridors  and  city  regions.  These
forms act as nodes where global and regional ﬂows
of people, capital, goods and information combine
and  commingle,  resulting  in  faster  growth,  both
demo graphic and economic, than the growth of the
countries where they are located.146 Connectivity and
regional trans port are crucial for the devel op ment of
these large agglomerations.

In some cases, large cities such as Cairo (Egypt),
Mexico City or Bangalore (India) are creating large
urban  conﬁgurations  in  which  they  dominate  the
surrounding  regional  space,  amalgamating  other 
cities  and  towns  within  their  economic  orbit.  In
other cases, two or more large cities, such as Mumbai
and Delhi in India; São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro in
Brazil; or Ibadan, Lagos (Nigeria) and Accra (Ghana)
form trans port corridors for the purposes of indus-
trial  devel op ment,  business  services  and  trade. 
Still, in other cases, the govern ment creates planned
‘supra-agglomerations’  as  part  of  a  regional  and
national  devel op ment  strategy.  This  is  the  case  in
China, where the Guangdong Provincial Govern ment
recently  announced  the  devel op ment  of  the  Pearl
River Delta mega-region, which would include nine
large cities, with an aggregate surface area of 40,000
square kilometres, and an impressive trans port infra -
struc ture (Box 5.11). Similarly, the large economic -
ally  prosperous  cities  of  Shanghai  and  Guangzhou
have invested in infra struc ture to connect peripheral
towns and enhance the large urban conﬁguration.147
Such  large  urban  conﬁgurations,  grouped  in
networks of cities, amplify the beneﬁts of economies
of agglomeration, increasing efﬁciencies and enhanc -
ing connectivity. They also generate economies of
scale that are beneﬁcial in terms of labour markets,
as well as trans port and communication infra struc -
ture, which in turn increases local consumer demand.

City cluster variances and trans port
responses
There are signiﬁcant differences in the patterns of
city clusters between regions and sub-regions. These
are explained by factors related to geography, climate,
population  size,  natural  resources,  culture,  land
management, political history, infra struc ture, markets
and levels of devel op ment. In addition, they are also
deﬁned by economic activities and the roles played
by trans port and connectivity.

In Europe, urban and regional planning has had
much more inﬂuence than in any other region of the
world. Large urban conﬁgurations have been located
along  major  trans port  routes  that  use  multi-modal

Box 5.11 Pearl River Delta mega-region

Megacities have become so large that some countries have moved to
planning supra-cities. These are network cities with populations of over 40
million. In 2010, the Guangdong Provincial Govern ment in China announced
it was planning to create the world’s biggest ‘mega-city’ by merging nine
cities into a mega-region metropolis. The new megacity would incorporate a
large part of China’s manufacturing heartland, and stretch in an arc from
Zhuhai to Shenzhen and include the cities of Foshan, Dongguan, Zhongshan,

Zhuhai, Jiangmen, Huizhou and Zhaoqing. The nine large cities that would
make up the new mega-region account for nearly a tenth of China’s
economy.

Trans port infra struc ture will improve connectivity and spatially
integrate the network of cities that make up this large urban/regional
configuration.

networks that integrate land, sea and air trans port
systems.  The  Trans-European  Transport  Network
(TEN-T) has constituted a key element in boosting
competitiveness and employment through a better
connectivity that allows goods and people to circulate
quickly and easily for higher economic, social and
territorial cohesion.148 TEN-T is working to improve
citizens’ quality of life and strengthening the econ -
omy  by  promoting  sus tain able urban  mobility  and
increased use of clean energy-efﬁcient vehicles.149
The  regional  infra struc ture  looks  at  speciﬁc  inter -
modal platforms at city level for better mobility and
connectivity at different scales.

Large  urban  conﬁgurations  in  Europe  have
emerged  as  specialized  industrial  and  business
centres along key trans port routes. However, these
urban conﬁgurations have populations that are less
dense than their counterparts in devel op ing regions.
Many European capital cities have become so called
supra-clusters150 of  cities,  with  massive  integrated
national trans port systems and the national capital
as a hub. Eastern and Southern European city clusters

are  becoming  much  more  dispersed,  taking  the 
form  of  regional  city  dominated  clusters.  Cities 
such as Warsaw (Poland) and Moscow (Russia) have
expanded in a concentric pattern from the historic
city  centre.  Moscow  has  many  features  similar  to
Beijing (China) and Dallas (US), with an expanding
ring road system and decentralized employment and
residential devel op ment.

City  clustering  in  North  American  cities,
particularly in the US, is the result of massive invest -
ment in freeway systems and planned urban/regional
devel op ment, with dispersed urban settlement pat -
terns and specialized functions. Most cities in these
large urban conﬁgurations have populations of over
1 million, and the typical morphology is polycentric
in terms of both urban form and economic structure.
Most  North  American  cities  have  well-established
central  business  districts.  However,  an  increasing
proportion of economic and employment activities
is  occurring  outside  these  areas.  The  Washington 
DC  region,  for  example,  has  expanded  as  a  large 
poly centric city into adjacent Maryland and Virginia.

It is made up of cluster or sub-regional global employ -
ment  centres  located  near  the  intersection  of  the
beltway  and  freeway  systems.  This  is  repeated  in
cities  such  as  Dallas,  Boston,  San  Francisco,  Los
Angeles and Chicago, to name just a few.

A  network  of  strategic  highways  made  up  of
260,000  kilometres,  known  as  the  National  High-
way System, connects major airports, ports, rail or
truck terminals, railway stations, pipeline terminals
and  other  strategic  trans port  facilities  in  the  US.
Although  the  system  includes  4  per  cent  of  the
nation’s roads, it carries more than 40 per cent of
the highway trafﬁc, 75 per cent of heavy truck trafﬁc
and  90  per  cent  of  tourist  trafﬁc.  All  urban  areas 
with a popu lation of over 50,000 and about 90 per
cent of America’s population live within 8 kilometres
of the network, which is the longest in the world.151
Inter-city or high-speed rail systems in the US are
undersized,  with  only  one  high-speed  rail  line  in
operation. The Acela Express runs between Washing -
ton and Boston via New York City (633 kilometres).
As  a  result  of  the  dispersed  population  and  great
distance between major cities, high-speed rail in the
US  is  of  less  value  than  air  or  car  travel.  In  com -
parison, China with its high population densities has
a high-speed railway network that spans over more
than 8300 kilometres already in service, and about
17,000 kilometres under construction.152

Large  urban  agglomerations  in  Asia  are  more
dispersed and less well planned. Densities of large
urban agglomerations in newly industrialized coun -
tries are typically much higher – over 15,000 persons
per  square  kilometre  –  but  in  city  regions,  they 
can be twice as high, particularly in inner-city areas.
Large  urban  conﬁgurations  are  becoming  more
specialized, including industrial cluster devel op ment
(high  technology  and  traditional  manufacturing) 
and services (health, technology and transport). There
is  signiﬁcant  variance  in  the  city  cluster  devel op-
ment in Asian sub-regions. The lack of basic services,
over crowding  and  high  levels  of  congestion  and
pollution in South, Central and South-Eastern Asia 
have led to a dispersed pattern of urban city cluster
devel op ment,  with  industrial/commercial  devel op -
ment  moving  out  from  the  congested  inner-city 
areas.  Cities  in  these  sub-regions  are  becoming 
much  bigger,  more  decentralized  and  specialized.
Some cities, such as Manila (the Philippines), Delhi
(India)  and  Kuala  Lumpur  (Malaysia),  have  well
developed sub-metropolitan centres of employment,
including commercial centres and large export enter -
prise zones. However, the links and integration of
trans portation  systems  and  services  between  the
city centres are poor. Uncontrolled leapfrogging of
urban  devel op ment  and  satellite  city  devel op
ment has occurred unabatedly in most cities in these
sub-regions. As a result, urban densities across these
city clusters are rapidly declining, with some cities

record ing annual decreases in density rates of more
than 3 per cent.153

Based on the regional planning principle to use
large cities to drive the devel op ment of small cities,
China  has  pursued  its  strategy  of  spatial  concen-
tration of urban population and industries. Clusters 
of  cities  are  grouped  along  the  horizontal  axes  of
Longhai  Railway  (Lianyungang–Lanzhou)  and  the
coastal area of China, along Beijing–Guangzhou and
Beijing–Harbin Railways and Baotou–Kunming trans -
portation corridors, respectively. Africa has very few
large urban conﬁgurations. Those in existence tend
to  be  linear  along  trans port  corridors  or  coastal
trading  routes  (e.g.  the  Abidjan  (Côte  d’Ivoire)–
Accra (Ghana)–Lagos (Nigeria) corridor) and major
arterial  roads  between  adjacent  provincial  cities
(Johannesburg–Pretoria,  South  Africa,  and  Lagos–
Ibadan, Nigeria). The Abidjan–Lagos coastal corridor
(998  kilometres)  links  some  of  the  largest  and
economically most dynamic capitals in Africa, such
as Abidjan, Accra, Lomé, Cotonou and Lagos. The cor -
ridor serves a population of over 35 million people
with  up  to  10,000  people  and  several  thousand
vehicles crossing borders daily, accounting for the
highest trafﬁc in West and Central Africa.154 These
corridors are not properly planned. As a result, trans -
port services are poor and so are infra struc ture and
trans port  logistics.  Employment  in  these  areas  is
driven  primarily  by  trading,  natural  resources  and 
low-level services. The typical pattern combines high
population density in inner cities and low densities
in outer areas. Eastern, Middle and Southern African
large urban agglomerations tend to form into low-
density urban cluster devel op ment, dispersed over
large peri-urban areas. This results in poor connec -
tivity and nascent trans port infra struc ture.

Despite having the highest proportion of urban
population  in  the  world,  Latin  American  and  the
Carib bean region has very few large urban con ﬁgura -
tions. Initially, the historic pattern of urbanization
was monocentric. However, with the devel op ment
of  secondary  cities  and  better  connectivity,  a  city
cluster pattern has emerged resulting in a polycentric
urban  growth.  Recently,  a  small  number  of  mega-
regions have emerged, such as the one that stretches
from São Paulo to Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) that is home
to  43  million  people.  This  mega-region  is  mainly
served by road and commercial ﬂights, though there
is a project to develop a high-speed train in the near
future. City regions such as Rio de Janeiro, Santiago
(Chile) and Caracas (Venezuela) are constrained by
physical  geography,  leading  to  spillover  corridor
devel op ment  along  valleys  and  inter-provincial
highways. Various other large cities are growing in
a diffuse, low-density pattern with peripheral indus -
trial devel op ment and housing.

IMPACTS OF
TRANSPORTATION
INVESTMENTS ON URBAN
FORM
Just  as  urban  form  and  land-use  patterns  shape
transportation,  transportation  investments  shape
urban  form.  The  opening  of  a  new  road  or  public
trans port line inﬂuences the locations, intensities and
types of devel op ment as well as the value of land. It
is the changes in accessibility, not the physical infra -
struc ture itself, that drive urban-form and land-use
changes,  following  transportation  infra struc ture
investments. Matching the infra struc ture hardware
with supportive policy software is essential, if hoped-
for  land-use  outcomes  are  to  follow.  Supportive
policies might include permissive zoning that allows
densiﬁcation  near  metro-rail  stations,  or  comple -
men tary expansion of sewerage/water-supply trunk
line capacities that accommodate new growth.

The section below reviews the impacts of public
trans port investments on urban form. This is followed
by discussions of motorways and their urban devel -
op ment impacts. Collectively, experi ences show that
transportation is a necessary but hardly a sufﬁcient
precondition for land-use changes.

Impacts of public trans port investments
History shows that urban rail systems, like metros
and light rail, are potential city-shapers.155 They often
deﬁne the growth spines and axes of cities, leading
to  higher  density  concentrations  of  industries, 
ofﬁces  and  businesses  along  rail-served  corridors. 
Rail-based public trans port investments – matched
by frequent, high-quality services – strengthen the
economic  primacy  of  central-city  locations.  They 
also  spur  sub-centring  and  decentralization,  and

are contingent on levels of proactiveness in leverag-
ing new devel opment and minimizing the growth-
restricting  im pacts  of  onerous  regulations  (Figure
5.20).156 In cities such as Toronto (Canada), Portland
(US)  and  Munich  (Germany),  regional  governing
systems help orchestrate TOD through a combina-
tion of regulation and incentive-based policies (e.g.
assistance with land assembly and underwriting devel -
op ment costs in redevel op ment districts). The new
rail systems in these cities have attracted signiﬁcant
shares of new devel op ments to station areas.157

Public trans port investments in rail-based ser -
vices exert their strongest spatial inﬂuence in large,
congested cities.158 While most empirical know ledge
is drawn from developed countries, theory suggests
that the city-shaping impacts of new rail investments
in devel op ing countries might be stronger. This is due
to rapid rates of population growth and motorization,
high levels of congestion (and thus a pent-up demand
for siting new devel op ment in accessibility-enhanced
locations) and rising dispos able incomes. In devel -
oping-country cities, however, weak institutions for
regional-scale  planning  and  an  orienta tion  toward
near-term  project  invest ments  versus  long-term
strategic  planning  are  working  against  successful
public trans port and land-use integration.159

Often, rail-based public trans port investments
end up being a stronger force toward decentralization
than concentration, by adding new layers of accessi -
bility to outlying settings (Figure 5.20). While growth
might be funnelled in a particular direction as a result
of a new public trans port line, more often than not,
this direction will be outward.160 Metro-rail invest -
ments  in  Santiago,  Mexico  City  and  other  Latin
American cities have also contributed to the segrega-
tion of households by income and class, displacing
the urban poor to the metropolitan periphery, while
modernizing and opening the inner city to wealthier
segments of the population.161 Critics argue that such
mal-distributive  impacts  are  rooted  in  transporta-
tion investments that favour the mobility interests
of  wealthier  individuals.  This  situation  is  further
exacerbated by lack of compensatory programmes,
such as affordable housing requirements, to moderate
such displacements.162 A more balanced portfolio of
transportation improvements that ensures beneﬁts
accrue to all socioeconomic groups can help mitigate
such unintended consequences. The desire to better
serve the mobility needs of the poor partly explains
Bogotá’s proactive investments in world-class BRT and
bikeway networks over the past decade.163

Global  experi ences  show  that  a  number  of
preconditions are necessary for urban public trans -
port investments  to  spawn  sus tain able urban-form
outcomes. Some of these are outlined in Box 5.12,
and are based on insights from a number of empirical
studies on the impacts of high-capacity public trans -
port systems on urban form in both developed and
devel op ing countries.

Box 5.12 Prerequisites to urban-form changes

Proactive planning is necessary if decentralized growth is
to take the form of sub-centres. Whether decentralized
growth takes a multi-centred form rests largely with the
degree of public commitment to strategic station-area
planning, carried out on a regional scale. Experi ences in cities
such as Toronto (Canada), Stockholm (Sweden), Munich
(Germany), Hong Kong (China) and Singapore show that an
aggressive stand to leverage the beneﬁts of rail services can
lead to more concentrated forms of decentralized growth.
Given public-resource commitments, railways and busways 
do not only strengthen the core but also produce multiple
sub-centres.

Railways and busways can spur central-city 
redevel op ment under the right conditions. When 
govern ment agencies are willing to absorb some of the 
risks inherent in redevel op ing economically stagnant 
neigh bour hoods, public trans port can help attract private
capital and breathe new life into struggling areas, as revealed 
in large cities such as Tokyo (Japan), Hong Kong (China),
London (UK), San Francisco Bay Area and metropolitan
Washington (US).

Other pro-devel op ment measures must accompany public
trans port investments. In addition to ﬁnan cial incentives,
experi ences show that supportive policies and public actions
must be in place to leverage land devel op ment. Foremost
among these are:

•
•

•

•

•

•

permissive and incentive zoning (e.g. density bonuses);
the availability of nearby vacant or easy-to-assemble and
developable parcels;
support for land-use changes among local residents (i.e.
organized opposition and NIMBY forces);
a hospitable physical setting (in terms of aesthetics, ease of
pedestrian circulation and a healthy neigh bour hood image);
complementary public improvements (e.g. upgrading of
sidewalks, expansion of water and sanitation trunk-line
capacities and burying utilities);
an absence of physical constraints (e.g. pre-emption of land
devel op ment by park-and-ride lots or the siting of a station
in a busy freeway median).

Public trans port service incentives and private car
‘equalizers’ (disincentives)a help induce station-area land-
use changes. The provision of frequent and reliable rail and
feeder bus connections is needed if private capital is to be
enticed to station areas. Only then will railways become time-
competitive with the private car. Such pro-public trans port
measures often need to be accompanied by ‘equalizer’ 
policiesa that remove many of the built-in incentives to drive,
such as the availability of plentiful, low-cost parking.
Congestion pricing in Singapore, Stockholm (Sweden) and
London (UK) partly explains why railway services in these
cities are heavily patronized and not unrelated, and why new
land devel op ment is occurring around these cities’ rail stations.
The combination of TOD and transportation demand
management can be especially powerful, yielding synergistic
beneﬁts, as suggested by experi ences in Singapore,
Copenhagen (Denmark), Stockholm and Ottawa (Canada).

Network effects matter. For ﬁxed-guideway public trans port
systems (e.g. railways and BRT systems with exclusive rights of
way) to induce large-scale land-use changes, it is essential that
they mimic the geographic coverage and regional accessibility
of their chief competitors, limited-access freeways and
highways. Good intermodal connections between high-capacity
public trans port systems and secondary systems, like bus and
paratransit feeders, serve to extend the spatial reach of
backbone systems. The strong city-shaping inﬂuences of
metros in Paris (France), London (UK) and Tokyo (Japan) are,
to a large extent, a result of such network effects, wherein
railways serve shares of origin-destination combinations that
are comparable to freeway and motorway networks. The
addition of a new railway or BRT line creates spillovers and
synergies, beneﬁting not only the newly served corridors but
existing ones as well. For existing metro lines, newly opened
lines increase the number of regional origin-destination
combinations that can be served.

Note: a The term ‘equalizer’ is preferred to ‘disincentive’ as such policies are not
punitive, and aim to ‘level the playing ﬁeld’ so as to remove any unfair advantages to
private car travel.

Public trans port and land price
appreciation

Accessibility beneﬁts conferred by rail systems get
capitalized  into  land  prices.  Higher  values  of  rail-
served  parcels  in  turn  exert  market  pressures  to
intensify land devel op ment. Land-value premiums of
commercial parcels within walking distance of metro-
rail stations are sometimes as high as 100 per cent
in the downtowns of some large cities.164 A survey
of 150 rail projects in the US, UK and Europe found
that  public  trans port  services  generated  posi tive
effects on residential as well as commercial prop er -

ties, though the magnitude of impacts varied con -
siderably.165 When rail investments are carefully co -
ordinated  with  land  devel op ment  through  public–
private  partner ships,  as  in  Portland,  Oregon,  the
results can be dramatic and catalytic. Portland’s east
and west light rail lines attracted over US$2.4 billion
in  investment  within  walking  distance  of  their
stations.166 The city’s new streetcar line through the
mixed residential-commercial Pearl District triggered
US$2.3 billion in private investments. According to
estimates, every dollar in public investment in public
trans port lever aged US$31 in private investments in
Portland.167

Planning and Design for Sustainable Urban Mobility

Land-value appreciation presents an opportunity
to recapture the value created by public investments
in  public  transport,  as  practiced  in  Hong  Kong, 
China (Box 8.7) and Tokyo, Japan (through private
railway consortia). Public trans port value captures not
only add revenues to the public coffers, but also by
sharing the value-added from public investments, land
specula tion  is  reduced.  In  Hong  Kong,  the  ‘Rail+
Property’ approach also creates market demand that
ensures  high-ridership  services.168 Hong  Kong’s
version  of  public–private  partnership  is  not  about 
off-loading  the  cost  of  building  railways  to  the 
private sector. Rather, it is about ‘co-devel op ment’
–  each  sector  bringing  a  natural  advantage  to  the 
table  (e.g.  land  acquisition  powers  in  the  case  of 
the public sector; access to equity capital in the case
of the private sector). The resulting ‘win–win’ situ -
ation leads to ﬁnan cially viable investments and an
intimate connection between rail systems and nearby
real-estate devel op ment that attracts tenants, new
inves tors and public trans port riders. Public-trans port
joint  devel op ments  (e.g.  the  leasing  of  air  rights
above metro-rail stations to private developers) are
another way to ﬁnan cially capitalize on the accessi -
bility beneﬁts conferred by public rail investments.169

Bus-based public trans port and urban-
form adjustments
Conventional  wisdom  holds  that  traditional  bus
services  have  imperceptible  inﬂuences  on  urban
form and land-use patterns because, in contrast to
many  rail  systems,  they  fail  to  deliver  appreciable
accessibility beneﬁts. This is especially the case in
developed countries where high levels of private car
ownership mean conventional buses are considerably
slower than cars for the vast majority of trips. The
ability to alter bus service levels, change bus routing,
as  well  as  the  stigma  attached  to  the  low-income
status  of  bus  patrons,  most  likely  suppress  the 
land-devel op ment  impacts  of  conventional  bus
services.  An  exception,  however,  is  BRT  wherein
buses are provided with an exclusive, dedicated lane,
which signiﬁcantly improves the quality of service.
BRT  investments  in  Ottawa  (Canada),  Pittsburgh
(US),  Brisbane  (Australia)  and  Curitiba  (Brazil)
generated  land-use  beneﬁts  that  were  as  large  as
those that would have been created by railway invest -
ments.170 Thus, it is not public trans port ‘hardware’
– i.e. steel-wheel trains or rubber-tire buses – that
unleash  land-use  changes,  but  rather  the  quality 
of  service  and  more  speciﬁcally,  the  comparative
travel-time savings of taking public trans port vis-à-
vis the private car.

As  with  rail,  where  BRT  investments  have
triggered  land  intensiﬁcation,  property  markets 
have  responded.  Signiﬁcant  land  price  increases 
have also been recorded near BRT stops in Bogotá
(Colom bia),  Seoul  (Republic  of  Korea),  Brisbane
(Australia)  and  Los  Angeles  (US).171 One  study 

re vealed that multi-family housing units within ﬁve-
minutes walking distance of Bogotá’s TransMilenio
BRT, were rented for appreciably more per square
metre  than  those  units  located  farther  away.172
Pedestrian-friendly environ ments near TransMilenio
stops,  further  increased  land-value  beneﬁts.173
Bogotá’s Trans Milenio  has  also  enjoyed  network
effects:  the  addi tion  of  new  TransMilenio  lines
increased  housing  rents  for  currently  served  resi -
dences more than opening new lines to previously
unserved  ones.174 Such  land-value  appreciations
create opportunities for value capture, just as with
urban rail systems. Bogotá practices value capture to
ﬁnance  urban  infra struc ture  under  a  programme
called Plusvalia, however implementation problems
– including high revenue collection costs and charges
of assessment biases and institutional corruption –
have undermined the pro gramme.175 More successful
has  been  Ahmeda bad’s  programme  of  exacting
surcharges from landholders, for the right to increase
their building densities by up to 30 per cent, along
the 89-kilometre Janmarg BRT system in India. Some
of the funds received are channelled towards building
affordable  housing,  particularly  for  low-income
households displaced by BRT expansion. In addition,
the  construction  of  parallel  cycle  tracks  to  the
Janmarg  BRT  is  helping  to  create  multi-modal
corridors and an ethos of ‘complete streets’ in the
minds of system designers and local citizens.176

Impacts of motorways
Motorways  generally  exert  stronger  inﬂuences  on
urban  form  than  public  trans port lines.177 Since
access is nearly ubiquitous with a car-based system,
activities tend to be dispersed and segregated. US
metropolises such as Los Angeles and Phoenix are
testaments to the sprawling effects of motorways.
Like a rail system, whatever clustering and agglom -
eration  occurs  tends  to  be  around  freeway  inter -
changes – e.g. shopping malls and large stand-alone
retail outlets. Also, impacts are often context speciﬁc,
shaped  by  the  permissiveness  of  land-use  regula-
tions and local real estate market demands. Other
impacts  include  the  institutional  capacity  to  sup -
plement roadways with other supportive infra struc -
ture to accom modate new growth, and the ability to
moderate  potential  neigh bour hood  opposition  to
nearby infra struc ture investments.

Worldwide, the impacts of new roads may vary
considerably. In poorer countries, road investments
generate new economic growth, opening access to
new markets and expanding trade-sheds. Developed
countries, by contrast, experi ence impacts that are
largely  redistributive,  hence  shifting  growth  that
might  otherwise  occur  in  some  settings  to  newly
served highway settings.178 This is mainly due to the
fact that accessibility levels are usually already so high
in developed settings that the economic impacts of
any new highway tend to be marginal.

CONCLUDING REMARKS
AND LESSONS FOR POLICY
A  paradigm  shift  is  occurring  in  the  relationship
between transportation systems, mobility and cities.
Public-policy  turnarounds,  like  the  removal  of
elevated freeways, the building of high-rise downtown
towers  interlaced  by  great  pedestrian  infra struc-
ture and transit-oriented corridors, all recognize that
travel  is  a  ‘derived  demand’  –  secondary  to  the
primary objective of connecting people and places.
As long as transportation is rightfully cast as a means
to an end, and not an end in and of itself, policies
can be put into place that enhance mobility while
avoiding (or at least reducing) negative externalities
and promoting community stability and cohesion.

Urban  form  is  principally  a  product  of  the
dominant  transportation  system  in  place  during 
the period of a region’s prevailing growth. Cities that
grew  rapidly  when  high-capacity  public  trans port
systems were being built, such as Toronto (Canada)
and Curitiba (Brazil) have high-density and lineal built
forms. Those that sprouted at the time when free-
ways  were  being  built  –  such  as  in  Phoenix  and
Houston (US) – have low-density, autocentric layouts.
As cities develop and prosper in devel op ing coun-
tries,  unprecedented  opportunities  will  arise  for
linking land devel op ment and trans port infra struc -
ture.  While  levels  of  motorization  are  stabilizing 
in developed countries, they are increasing rapidly
elsewhere.  Given  the  fact  that  a  vast  majority  of
future  urban  growth  is  projected  for  cities  with  a
current population of less than 500,000 inhabitants,
a  bus-based  form  of  smaller  scale  TOD  interlaced 
by  high-quality  infra struc ture  for  pedestrians  and
cyclists may be appropriate in many urban settings.
Cities  introducing  railway  and  BRT  solutions  are
bound  to  trigger  meaningful  land-use  changes,
including rapid growth and rising real incomes. This,
of course, assumes there is supportive planning and
zoning, public-sector leveraging and risk sharing, a
commitment  to  travel-demand  management  to
remove many built-in incentives to car use, and the
capacity to manage the land-use shifts that are put
into  motion  by  transportation 
infra struc ture
investments.

There are signs that cities in different parts of
the  world  are  moving  towards  the  devel op ment 
of more compact forms. Numerous cities have un -
veiled  devel op ment  plans  that  emphasize  urban
designs that shorten trips, create complete streets,
encourage  mixed-use  devel op ments  and  make 
cities more liveable.179 Globally, there is a growing
appreciation  in  various  devel op ing-country  cities 
that  integrated  trans port  and  land-use  planning  is
critical toward future economic success, more equit -
able devel op ment and environ mentally sus tain able
solutions.

Global experi ences reveal that a cogent regional
vision  helps  considerably  in  ensuring  transporta-
tion  investments  produce  desired  urban-form  out -
comes. Visions need visionaries, such as Curitiba’s
Jaime Lerner, Bogotá’s Enrique Peñalosa and Seoul’s
Myong-Bak Lee. However, visions are malleable, and
are therefore subject to change as realities unfold.
Often,  cities  are  path  dependent  in  their  spatial
evolutions, thus breaking away from established prac -
tices can be difﬁcult and slow. Traditionally, high -
ways were built to serve urban sprawl, which in turn
requires  the  construction  of  more  highways.  This
vicious cycle of road construction and urban growth
feeding  off  each  other  is  often  difﬁcult  to  break.
Accordingly, sustained leadership in working toward
a  common  urban-form  visionary  becomes  all  the
more crucial.

While the importance of linking land use and city
form to transportation and mobility is increasingly
recognized,  moving  from  rhetoric  to  reality  is  not
always easy. The list of true success stories is quite
short. Whereas the experi ences of Curitiba (Brazil),
Portland  (US),  Singapore,  Copenhagen  (Denmark)
and Stockholm (Sweden) are well-chronicled, there
is  a  need  for  best-case  practices  that  are  directly
applicable and relevant to the unique problems of
cities in devel op ing countries. Another notable gap
is  the  limited  knowledge  about  the  inﬂuences  of
‘goods movements’ on urban devel op ment patterns
and vice versa. The siting of large warehouse distri -
bution  complexes  on  urban  peripheries  no  doubt
contributes to sprawl. As noted in Chapter 4, the
spatial needs for goods handling and freight terminals,
warehousing, commercial markets and the array of
formal and informal delivery carriers are rarely given
due priority in urban planning. Opportunities exist
for improving urban logistics, such as the creation
of freight consolidation centres on the periphery that
allow  a  single  truck  to  deliver  goods  to  multiple
destinations.  Compact,  mixed-use  devel op ment,
moreover, can promote efﬁcient urban logistics by
allowing few-stop deliveries.

The integration of transportation, city form and
function and mobility strategies are not, in and of
themselves, a panacea to the multitude of problems
facing today’s major cities. Transportation and land-
use integration, with the devel op ment of more sus -
tain able densities in strategic locations, is but one
of a number of strategies that must be pursued if
substantial headway is to be made in shrinking the
trans port sector’s ecological footprint. In addition to
the  environ mental dividends  of  improved  trans -
portation and land-use integration, there are other
reasons – such as social inclusion, economic growth
and  municipal  cost  savings  –  for  creating  more
accessible,  more  liveable  and  less  car-dependent
cities of the future. Such issues are discussed in the
next three chapters of this report.

NOTES

1 In this report, the term ‘urban

form’ is used broadly to express
the physical layout, design, space
and morphology of cities,
including buildings, roads and
streets. It represents the spatial
conﬁguration of a city and, as
discussed throughout the
chapter, is both shaped by and
gives form to transportation
infra struc ture and services. 
The term ‘built environ ment’ is
often used to reﬂect the many
physical dimensions of a city and
its neigh bour hoods that
inﬂuence travel. In this report,
terms such as urban form, land
use and built environ ment are
used interchangeably.

EQUITABLE ACCESS TO 
URBAN MOBILITY

Mobility is a social and economic need. The avail -
ability  of  trans port  options,  and  the  way  they  are
delivered,  can  present  major  challenges  to  the
mobility of many residents in today’s cities. Invest -
ments in urban trans port infra struc ture do little to
alleviate the mobility difﬁculties of the urban poor
or other vulnerable and dis advan taged groups if the
services  provided  are  unaffordable  or  physically
inaccessible. Such barriers contribute to socio-spatial
inequities in urban areas, including discrimination
against vulnerable and dis advan taged groups. These
barriers are not only ﬁscal or technical in nature, but
arise from political, social and institutional factors that
prevent progress towards socially sus tain able urban
mobility systems. Thus, this chapter focuses on the
aspects  of  urban  mobility  that  relate  to  providing
affordable access to opportunities, minimizing social
exclusion and improving the quality of life for all.

In recent years, trans port policy has begun to
focus more intently on new assessment and evalu -
ation  regimes,  to  better  articulate  the  impacts  of
trans port  investments.  Whereas  trans port  projects
undergo environ mental and economic impact assess -
ments, the application of social impact assess ments
is relatively less advanced.1 Integrating social dimen -
sions throughout the lifecycle of trans port projects
enhances  their  potential  to  bring  life-changing
beneﬁts to the end users, while reducing the risk of
negative  social  outcomes.2 The  additional  effort
invested in social analysis can bring disproportionate
returns: projects that are more appropriate, sus tain -
able, safe and high quality, and that enhance com -
munity engagement and participation.

As  city  mobility  systems  become  increasingly
motorized, travellers are vulnerable to trafﬁc-related
conﬂicts and accidents, congestion, as well as the
costs of motorized transport, while penalizing those
who  cannot  afford  a  car.  Without  a  good  public
trans portation  system,  travellers  face  a  complex
trade-off between shelter security, travel distance and
travel mode.3 At the same time, non-motorized road
users (primarily pedestrians and cyclists) and public

trans port users – particularly in devel op ing countries
– are often overlooked in the design and modern -
ization of transportation infra struc ture.4

As  noted  in  Chapter  1,  the  main  purpose  of
urban  mobility  systems  is  to  provide  access  to 
basic goods, services and activities – such as work,
education, medical care, shopping, socializing – and
to  enable  people  to  participate  in  civic  life.  The
Habitat Agenda explicitly calls for full accessibility to
work, goods and services – to affordable public trans -
port – including for those belonging to vulnerable
and  dis advan taged  groups,  stressing  that  priority
should be given to the needs of women and children
‘who often bear the greatest burden of poverty’.5 Yet,
in reality, people and communities do not have equal
access to urban opportunities. The unequal access
per se is not necessarily problematic, however, the
distribution of impacts (beneﬁts, dis advan tages and
costs) can be considered ‘unfair’, in which case this
becomes an issue of social equity. Considerations of
equity in urban mobility systems frequently analyse
disparities in access to urban opportunities, as well
as disparities in income and travel-related costs. In
light  of  these  challenges,  the  satisfaction  of  the
mobility needs of all groups of society is a necessary
condition  for  supporting  equal  chances  in  life.6
Ultimately,  restrictions  in  access  to  urban  oppor -
tunities may imply an abuse of human rights, most
notably economic, social and cultural rights (such as
the rights to free choice of employment; the right
to  public  health,  medical  care,  social  security  and
social services; the right to education and training;
and  the  right  to  equal  participation  in  cultural
activities)  and  the  right  of  access  to  any  place  or
service intended for use by the general public.

This daunting information raises the question:
what  do  we  mean  by  socially  sus tain able urban
mobility?  As  there  are  competing  perceptions  and
applications of ‘social sus tain ability’,7 some cities opt
for  a  single,  encompassing  deﬁnition  that  denies
much  of  the  concept’s  complexity.  Additionally,
translating the complex subjective, qualitative and

Planning and Design for Sustainable Urban Mobility

Improved
transport
connections can
help in tackling
social exclusion
through
addressing
barriers posed by
the accessibility,
availability,
acceptability, and
affordability of
the urban mobility
system

political dimensions of social sus tain ability into easy-
to-measure quantitative indicators is complicated (at
best).8 In  order  to  produce  meaningful  results,
metrics  must  be  tailored  to  reﬂect  unique  socio-
cultural  characteristics  of  contexts  and  locations,
hindering the adoption of any one common measure -
ment. Nonetheless, it is important to consider the
elements of social sus tain ability in any evaluation of
mobility modes, since these social implications affect
behavioural choices, which are ultimately responsible
for  the  success  or  failure  of  any  urban  mobility
system.

Meeting the mobility needs of burgeoning urban
populations  in  a  socially  inclusive  (and  equitable)
manner will not be an easy task. The most critical
challenge is the heterogeneity of urban populations
and  the  spatial  dispersion  of  social  and  economic
activities. The best way to meet the mobility needs
of the poor and vulnerable and dis advan taged groups
is to provide adequate public trans port and appro -
priate  infra struc ture  for  non-motorized  modes  of
travel. Further more, improved urban planning, new
technologies and infra struc ture measures are needed.
Notably, emphasis should be placed on moving people
and goods, freely and safely, and facilitating equitable
access to services.

This chapter documents global trends, conditions
and challenges with respect to equitable access to
urban  mobility.  It  highlights  actual  and  potential
policy  responses  and  practices  that  may  address
social  equity  and  enhance  social  sus tain ability  in
urban mobility systems. The ﬁrst section discusses
affordability  as  an  important  aspect  of  equitable
access.  It  notes  that  trans port  expenditures  affect
low-income  households  disproportionately.  The
second  section  discusses  the  access  of  dis advan -
taged groups to urban mobility systems. This provides
the necessary background to understand and accom -
modate  the  differential  mobility  needs  of  various
population  segments.  The  third  section  explores
issues relating to safety and security in urban mobility
systems. It distinguishes between the problems of
trans port  safety  (accidents  and  damages)  and  the
problems of trans port security (privacy and freedom

from  fear).  The  ﬁnal  section  provides  concluding
comments and lessons for policy.

AFFORDABLE URBAN
MOBILITY
In  order  for  urban  mobility  systems  to  be  socially 
sus tain able, urban public trans port must be afford-
able  to  the  majority  of  the  urban  population,  and 
in  particular  for  those  that  have  no  other  way  of
travelling to access basic goods, services and activities.
This  is  a  critical  equity  objective  that  can  reduce
burdens  and  expand  opportunities,  particularly  to
persons  who  are  vulnerable  and/or  dis advan taged.
Based  on  the  discussion  in  earlier  chapters,  this
section analyses challenges and impacts related to
equitable access and public trans port affordability.
It  also  examines  policy  responses  designed  to
promote  affordable  transportation.  It  ﬁnishes  by
presenting good practices and policies from around
the  world,  pointing  the  way  towards  successful
transformation of urban mobility culture.

Challenges and impacts of urban poverty
An  understanding  of  the  travel  patterns  of  urban
public trans port users is required to determine the
extent  of  their  mobility  challenges.  The  notion  of
motility implies the balance between accessibility
(i.e. transportation opportunities: public trans port and
other modes) and individual skills (i.e. how to use
the transportation on offer), with the user’s appro -
priation of the mobility system (i.e. their experi ences,
habits, perceptions and values linked to travel mode
and space).9 As such, access is the most im portant
facet of motility, because it sets the scene for possible
mobility. Improved trans port connections can help
in  tackling  social  exclusion  through  addressing
barriers  posed  by  the  accessibility,  avail ability,
acceptability,  and  affordability of  the  urban
mobility system (Box 6.1). In such cases, information
from  and  the  participation  of  all  stakeholders,
throughout the planning process, is needed in the
devel op ment of mobility systems.

Box 6.1 Understanding the parameters of urban transport

Affordability refers to the extent to which the ﬁnan cial cost
of journeys puts an individual or household in the position of
having to make sacriﬁces to travel, or to the extent to which
they can afford to travel when they want to.
Availability of trans port is used to refer to route possibilities,
timings and frequency.
Accessibility describes the ease with which all categories of
passen ger can use public transport. For example, buses with
high steps are difﬁcult to board, particularly if they are one-

person operated and there is no assistance. Accessibility also
includes ease of ﬁnding out about travel possibilities, i.e. the
information function.
Acceptability is another important quality of public transport,
either because of the trans port or the standards of the
traveller. For example, travellers may be deterred from using
public trans port due to lack of personal security on buses and
trains.

International  research  into  the  relationships
between  trans port  and  poverty  indicates  that  the 
poor are increasingly concentrated on the periphery
of  urban  areas.10 As  a  result,  they  travel  longer
distances than many better-off groups and their need
for affordable trans port is increased. This implies that
where  (transportation)  inequities  persist,  these
exacerbate social exclusion and poverty, both at the
individual  and  at  the  society  level.  In  this  case,
poverty is viewed as the lack of ﬁnan cial resources
to meet basic individual or household needs, while
social exclusion refers to existing barriers that make
it difﬁcult for people to participate fully in society.11
The choice of mobility mode is related to income
levels.12 For those with low incomes there are very
few affordable choices. As a result, in many devel -
op ing countries, only a small proportion of trips are
undertaken  using  motorized  vehicles.13 The  prev -
alence of long walking trips indicates poor access and
lack of affordable mobility options. Therefore, it is
essential that pedestrians must be accounted for in
any public trans port policy. In Tianjin, China, 80 per
cent  of  all  commuter  trips  are  by  non-motorized
modes, mainly bicycles.14 Cycling offers an inexpen -
sive means of improving accessibility for all. In some
European countries, the use of bicycles as a mode
of  trans port  is  steadily  increasing,  both  as  a  main
mode and as a subsidiary or feeder mode.15 However,
in Africa and Latin America, it is often neglected in
terms  of  design  and  safety,  due  to  negative  social
representations,  associating  bicycle  use  with
poverty.16

In devel op ing countries, car ownership remains
the privilege of a small (although rapidly growing)
minority. In some countries of Africa and parts of Asia,
vehicle ownership rates are as low as three motor
vehicles  per  1000  population.17 Hence,  ﬁnan cially
deprived households depend exclusively on public
trans port (formal or informal) for motorized trips, and
are exposed to the risks of increasing trans port costs.
In  many  developed  countries,  the  dependency  on
private  motorized  trans port tends  to  increase  per
capita  transportation  costs  and  reduce  transporta-
tion  affordability.18 As  most  road  infra struc ture  is
subsidized, there is no incentive for car owners to
shift to cleaner travel options, as it costs so much
less to drive. Yet, urban sprawl and car-dependent
urban  growth  continue  worldwide,  and  can  com -
promise the levels of accessibility among vulnerable
and dis advan taged groups, such as the elderly and
children.19

Socioeconomic differences in travel patterns in
many developed countries (such as the UK and the
US)  indicate  that  the  poor  and  ethnic  and  other
minorities are less likely to have cars and are more
likely  to  travel  by  public  transport.  From  Delhi  to
Shanghai and Brussels to New York, the provision of
economical and convenient ‘last-mile connectivity’ –
i.e. from the trip ends to the point of accessing public

trans port systems  –  remains  a  major  issue  of
concern.20 Poor walking and cycling environ ments
further accentuate the problem for public trans port
users, particularly the disabled and elderly. In larger
cities, the trend is towards ﬁxed-route bus services,
which  often  implies  that  journeys  become  more
complex, often involving interchanges and lengthy
waiting and walking times. Evidence suggests that
public trans port deﬁciencies in urban areas have a
greater impact on the poor than on other groups.21
However, the fares charged by private informal
operators  are  often  higher  than  publicly  operated
ones, particularly if one takes into account the lack
of fare integration between routes. While a passen -
ger of a public trans port service may often pay a ﬂat
rate for a trip that involves several individual legs,
such fare integration is rare among informal trans -
port providers. Consequently, the poor are forced to
carefully  prioritize  their  mobility  needs  and
expenditure.

For many urban dwellers, the cost of mobility
is very high in relation to their household incomes.
In cities of devel op ing countries, between 8 and 16
per cent of household income is spent on transport.
Among the poorest households in large cities, this
rises to more than 25 per cent.22 Thus, the level and
quality of trans port services are often lower for those
in low-income areas, where commuters are heavily
dependent  on  public  trans port for  their  mobility
needs.  People  have  little  option  but  to  endure  a
deteriorating service. The disproportionate ﬁnan cial
burden felt by the poor in reaching job opportunities
is not limited to devel op ing countries. Data from the
US  suggest  that  low-income  earners  spend  nearly
twice as much of their income reaching their place
of employment compared to the non-poor (6.1 per
cent versus 3.8 per cent).23

Constrained mobility is an important element of
the social exclusion that deﬁnes urban poverty.24 As
outlined above: without effective trans port systems,
poor households are unable to access basic goods,
services and activities. It is important also to consider
the ﬂow of social capital in the form of information,
news or job opportunities facilitated through trans -
port networks.25 Table 6.1 illustrates how improved
mobility has a signiﬁcant impact on the four major
dimensions of poverty.

As  indicated  in  Table  6.1  there  are  several
important  links  between  trans port  infra struc ture 
and  services  and  different  dimensions  of  poverty. 
Poor people’s lack of assets and technologies means
that  production  –  for  the  market  as  well  as  for 
the household – is time and energy intensive. The
greatest proportion of the lowest productivity, most
time-consuming  work  is  done  by  women.26 By
focusing more investment in the infra struc ture and
services used by (and appropriate to) women, their
‘time poverty’ can be drastically reduced.

Other direct impacts on poverty that the trans -
port  sector  can  help  achieve  include  employment
generation – in trans port infra struc ture projects, as
well as in the trans port service industry. Delivery of
infra struc ture can be done in ways that optimize the
use  of  local  labour  and  resources.  Similarly,  local
trans port  services  have  a  potential  for  providing
employment  to  operators  and  providers  of  other
support services. However, improved infra struc ture
planning and service provisions are resources that,
in combination, either enhance or dis advan tage the
livelihood of urban dwellers.27

A  key  example  is  eviction  and  resettlement
resulting directly from urban trans port infra struc ture
projects. As illustrated in Box 6.2, these projects often
disrupt lives and livelihoods, and may form physical
barriers that cause community severance. Streets that
were  once  a  place  where  people  stopped  for
conversation and children played are transformed into
the  exclusive  domain  of  cars.  Further more,  the
quality of the local environ ment is vastly reduced with
noise and air pollution.28 Moreover, without secure
tenure  the  poorest  groups  risk  being  displaced
through gentriﬁcation. The narrow focus on solving
congestion  tends  to  mostly  beneﬁt  high-income

private vehicle users. More thoughtful and holistic
solutions  are  thus  needed  to  bring  beneﬁts  to  a
wider population.

Detailed and systematic consideration of social
issues  in  urban  mobility  appraisals  maximizes  the
opportunities for positive outcomes and reduces or
mitigates the risks and negative impacts of trans port
infra struc ture  projects.  Unfortunately,  the  urban
poor are often marginalized in trans port planning and
project evaluations. However, the establishment of
good relationships with stakeholders and a focus on
their  concerns  have  the  potential  to  generate
signiﬁcant positive opportunities for the project and
the organizations involved.

In summary, the access and mobility of the
urban  poor  is  constrained  by:  city  planning,
socio economic characteristics, trans port facil -
ities  and  the  availability  of  services.  The  next
section outlines some general ways in which policy
can be refocused to give particular assistance to the
poorest  groups,  through  concentration  on  the 
needs of speciﬁc social groups, or indirectly through
assistance  to  those  modes  of  trans port  on  which 
the  urban  poor  are  known  to  be  particularly
dependent.

Box 6.2 Nairobi–Thika highway improvement project, Kenya

The Nairobi–Thika highway is one of the three major
corridors linking downtown Nairobi to the suburbs and
satellite towns. Jointly ﬁnanced by the African Devel op ment
Bank, and the Chinese govern ment, the project aims to
contribute to and improve the accessibility, affordability and
reliability of the trans port infra struc ture, as well as reduce
trafﬁc congestion. The expanded Thika Road, which was
completed in July 2012, has drawn mixed reactions from
residents living along the highway, who are particularly
concerned about the socioeconomic impact the new road will
have on their lives.

The construction of the highway disrupted neigh bour -

hoods by relocating urban residents to the periphery and
increasing their travel distances and expenditures. Severance
of communities by trafﬁc and the highway is a particular
problem for people without access to a car, some older

people, people with disabilities and school children, because
they often rely on walking. The project’s focus on fast and
free-ﬂowing trafﬁc has resulted in the need to construct
pedestrian overpasses and barriers, which often leads to
community severance and inconvenience for the local
population.

The skyrocketing property values along the new road

have been reported to threaten food security in an area whose
residents rely on subsistence farming for sustenance, as
farmland is bought up for new devel op ment. Further more, due
to the increased cost of living, many tenants in the area have
been forced to move out, as they could no longer afford the
rents. Moreover, inadequate or unaffordable trans port has led
to excessive building and population densities, causing
deterioration of the living environ ment.

Policy responses and innovative practices
This  section  highlights  some  ambitious  policy  res -
ponses that have been introduced in recent years to
address  the  challenges  outlined  above.  Achieving
trans port  affordability  objectives  requires  actions
that  support  non-motorized  transport;  reduce  the
ﬁnan cial  costs  of  trans port  services;  and  increase
transportation affordability through improved land-
use accessibility.

n Supporting non-motorized transport
Trans port policy measures can reduce levels of car
use by supporting walking and cycling.29 These modes
are relatively low cost, and they are important for
short trips, which make up the largest share of trips
in  urban  areas.30 Non-motorized  trans port can  be
stimulated by a policy package consisting of invest -
ments in facilities, improved transportation networks,
awareness  campaigns,  as  well  as  disincentives  for 
the use of private motorized vehicles. Many cities in
developed  countries  recognize  the  need  to  plan
walkable environ ments and street network designs
that promote neigh bourly interactions, and through
this, the devel op ment of social capital.31

Some  signiﬁcant  trans port  interventions  offer
interesting  lessons.  Amsterdam  (the  Netherlands) 
and  Copenhagen  (Denmark)  have  high  levels  of
bicycle use and very low death rates from road trafﬁc
accidents.32 The  high  modal  shares  were  made
possible  through  decades  of  investment  in  non-
motorized  trans port infra struc ture.  This  includes
wide-scale improvements to pedestrian and bicycle
facilities;  devel op ment  of  facilities  for  intermodal
connectivity; and adoption of complete pedestrian
and  bicycle  design  standards,  wherever  feasible.
Many other cities have moved away from car-centric
urban models and embraced full pedestrianization of
downtown  commercial  areas  such  as  observed  in
Shanghai  (China)  and  Curitiba  (Brazil).33 This  has
provided economic savings and beneﬁts, reﬂected in
increased land values. 34

Combining  public  trans port and  cycling  can
provide a high level of affordable mobility. A case in
point  is  vélib,  a  free  public  bicycle  rental  scheme 
in Paris, France.35 Hangzhou (China)36 and Mexico

City have also established bicycle hire schemes to
encourage cycling at a minimum cost to taxpayers
and users of the scheme. Such policies are increas -
ingly  linked  with  investments  in  BRT  systems,  for
instance in Delhi (India), Guangzhou (China), Jakarta
(Indonesia)  and  Dar  es  Salaam  (Tanzania),  placing
non-motorized trans port infra struc ture as important
feeder networks for BRT ridership.37 Box 6.3 high -
lights recent devel op ments in Africa that encourage
increasing investments in non-motorized trans port
infra struc ture.

The need to consider bicycle designs that will
accommodate  both  environ mental requirements 
and commuters’ needs is essential.38 Recently, the
Institute for Transportation and Devel op ment Policy
(ITDP) succeeded in the commercial adoption of an
improved  Indian  cycle  rickshaw.  Reduced  weight
and  greater  comfort  have  allowed  rickshaw  oper-
ators to increase their wages by 20–50 per cent.39
However, whereas they are important for the survival
of  numerous  owner-drivers,  rickshaws  had  been
banned from major roads in Dhaka as a way to reduce
road  congestion.  Such  policies  can  have  adverse
impacts  on  vulnerable  and  dis advan taged  persons,
such  as  loss  of  employment  and  reduced  mobility
levels.40 Uganda,  meanwhile,  was  home  to  about
200,000 boda bodas (bicycle-taxis) in 2000, 41 which
provide employment for large numbers of previously
unemployed youth. Subsequently, there has been a
widespread increase in the use of motorcycle taxis
within both Uganda and Kenya.42

Training  is  an  important  strategic  instrument 
not only for disseminating new knowledge but also
for capacity building and increasing the awareness
of the needs of non-motorized trans port users. The
private sector could be a key partner in supply-side
interventions to increase bicycle ownership and use
through the promotion of micro-credit programmes
and  providing  cycling  education.  In  the  1990s,
women  in  Pudukkottai,  India,  were  provided  with
loans to purchase bicycles and given cycling lessons,
so  that  they  could  access  a  literacy  programme.
Additionally, the programme provided employment
opportunities for the women, who were trained as
bicycle mechanics. Five years later, it is now socially
acceptable for women to ride a bicycle, and bicycles

Box 6.3 Supporting non-motorized trans port investments in Africa

In 2008–2009, African govern ment ministers participated in
workshops that developed framework agreements that
recognized the importance of trans port infra struc ture and
urban planning. The need to raise investments in non-
motorized trans port infra struc ture is identiﬁed as a key
component to an integrated approach in trans port for Africa.

The agreed article in the ‘Eastern Africa Regional

Framework Agreement on Air Pollution’, endorsed the idea 

of a 10 per cent investment policy as follows: ‘Encourage the
use of non-motorized trans port systems that have many
advantages and are used by an overwhelming majority, but are
constantly overlooked. At a minimum 10% of infra struc ture
costs should be dedicated to this majority and the focus
should be on safety. Particular emphasis should be given to
high-demand, mixed-use roads in urban and peri-urban areas’.

Box 6.4 Integrating non-motorized trans port into transportation systems in Bogotá, Colombia

During the administration of Mayor Enrique Peñalosa, Bogotá’s
visionary goal was centred on liveability, social equity and
reclamation of public space. To achieve this, the administration
established policies in seven areas: institutional strengthening,
restraining private car use, public space, public transport, non-
motorized transport, road maintenance and trafﬁc
management.

Large investment in infra struc ture for non-motorized
and public trans port was justiﬁed by its impact on equality.
Inclusive investments for all, such as bicycle lanes, pedestrian
highways and the BRT system, demonstrated a commitment to
public good over private ownership. Likewise, actions such as
the removal of cars from sidewalks, car-free Sundays and
establishing a highway solely for Transmileno, exhibited

consideration to those on low incomes who do not beneﬁt
from investment in motorized trans port infra struc ture. The
theme of equality was a key driver in the devel op ment of a
357-kilometre long bicycle network (known as cicloruttas). The
bicycle network was deliberately designed to run through low-
income and wealthy areas in order to promote integration and
a sense that all citizens had an equal stake in city-wide devel op -
ment. These devel op ments acted as ‘social equalizers’,
providing the poor with better trans port links and free leisure
facilities. People supported the measures once they saw
results, and Peñalosa left ofﬁce with a record approval rating.
Decisive leadership, political will and strong institutions were
the critical factors contributing to success.

are being used for going to school, fetching water
and  going  to  hospital  during  an  emergency.  The
example  of  Bogotá,  Colombia,  shows  that  strong
non-motorized  trans port policies,  awareness  cam -
paigns and political commitment can bring about a
shift  in  public  attitudes  towards  non-motorized
transport, as well as enhanced social inclusion (Box
6.4).43 However, there is still a lot to be done, and
the  Transmileno  system  still  needs  to  be  further
developed to fulﬁl its promises. One of the major
critiques is the lack of coverage, as many groups of
people are excluded from the current 84-kilometre
system simply because it is not yet operating in their
neighborhoods. Thus, many of Bogotá’s residents are
still relying on the traditional bus system, which is,
in  effect,  operating  in  competition  with  Trans -
mileno.44

Most  cities  in  devel op ing  countries  are  high
density and therefore suitable for policies promoting
non-motorized  transport.  Travel-demand  manage -
ment has a key role to play in this context. Such urban
policies  affect  the  demand  for  travel  through  the
pricing and regulation of different modes of transport.
An  important  beneﬁt  of  travel-demand  manage-
ment  strategies,  besides  improving  the  quality  of 
low-cost  transportation  modes,  has  been  increas-
ing  public  trans port affordability  for  low-income
groups.45 In the UK, there has been a change from
road building towards the introduction of demand-
man agement  initiatives.  Progressively,  London  has
experi enced  a  modal  shift,  in  part  due  to  its  con -
gestion  charging  scheme,  making  it  possible  to
convert trafﬁc lanes to bicycle lanes.46 The adoption
of automated bus lane enforcement has dramatically
improved the speed and reliability of bus services.
Generally, con sumers are able to save money if they
use alterna tive modes, routes or travel times to avoid
driving on congested roads.47

n Improving affordability and quality of service

of public transport

Public trans port fares should be set at rates that allow
commuters to use it. In devel op ing countries, fares
are often set above competitive equilibrium levels.48
This promotes excessive entry of buses, and is further
exacerbated by the capture of the regulator. Since
buses are not perfect substitutes, price competition
is  not  an  effective  mechanism  for  regulating  the
optimal quantity of buses in the market. To minimize
waiting time, most riders prefer to use the ﬁrst bus
that arrives, even though a cheaper bus may come
along in a few minutes. Time, not fares, seems to be
the  most  important  variable  for  the  rider.  This
simpliﬁes the bus operator’s market power to raise
fares.49

Notably, consideration should be made to ensure
that  the  fare  (plus  subsidies)  covers  the  cost  of
operation, and at the same time remains affordable
to the public. This is particularly important, as setting
fares artiﬁcially low – without compensating service
providers – can undermine the viability of a trans -
port system. For instance, the bus fare needed to
cover the operating costs in Lomé (Togo) was 295
CFA Francs. Yet, the fares charged were 250 CFA
Francs, which was later reduced to 200 CFA Francs
(by the govern ment), thereby resulting in an oper -
ating deﬁcit of 22 million.50 Thus, a delicate balance
must be struck between the consumer’s convenience
and willingness to pay, and the operator’s need to
balance its budgets (or to make a proﬁt, in the case
of private-sector operators).51

The  promotion  of  affordable  transportation
requires a robust framework that deﬁnes and meas -
ures  transportation  affordability  appropriately.
Conventional planning tends to consider a relatively
limited range of trans port affordability impacts and
objectives.  To  address  this  limitation,  the  World
Bank has developed an affordability index to address
the  need  for  easily  available  and  comprehensive,

comparative  information  on  affordability  of  public
trans port fares across the globe (Table 6.2). The index
values may be deﬁned as the fare expenditure (for a
total  of  60  10-kilometre  trips  per  month)  as  a
percentage of income. It can be computed for various
income  groups  and  the  results  may  be  used  to
determine whether the proportion of income spent
on fares is reasonable, high or onerous.

The  data  in  Table  6.2  show  huge  variances
between cities, due to their different contexts. The
low-income residents of São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and
Brasília  (Brazil)  are  all  faced  with  unbearable
situations, as trans port expenses would account for
more  than  half  of  their  incomes.  Cities  such  as
Bangkok and Cairo, by contrast, have low fares, due
to the low public trans port fares (Bangkok) and the
absence  of  extreme  poverty  in  the  lower  quintile
(Cairo).52 Despite  this  improvement,  the  index  is
limited  by  the  simpliﬁed  nature  of  the  indicators
employed,  as  well  as  the  questionable  quality  of

available statistics. As such, there is need for a more
precise analysis.

Trans port subsidy is an important policy option
for ensuring equitable trans port access for the poor
and other road users. However, such subsidies are
blunt instruments and require careful design to be
both  socially  and  economically  justiﬁed.  Poorly
targeted subsidies may result in the rich deriving a
disproportionate  beneﬁt  compared  to  the  poor.  A
more  efﬁcient  approach  is  a  strategy  involving
appropriately targeted subsidies by route or through
employer-based schemes.53 In Brazilian cities, since
1987 employers must, by law, subsidize the trans -
port costs of their employees (if these costs exceed
6 per cent of their salaries) under the Vale-Transporte
(‘transportation  vouchers’)  system.  This  system
implies  that  the  employer  buys  public  trans port
vouchers or tops up the electronic trans port passes
of their employees directly (i.e. without involving the
govern ment).  Employers  can,  as  an  alternative,

provide staff transport.54 However, the system applies
only to the employees of the formal sector, meaning
that more than 50 per cent of the urban workforce
(including the major part of the poor and low-income
population) is excluded from the scheme.55

The reform of the urban public trans port sector
in Kazakhstan is an illustration of a project resulting
in poverty alleviation for the poor. Prior to reform,
the  public  trans port system  was  characterized  by
inadequate services, as well as crowded and lengthy
waiting times. A trans port intervention was initiated
to deregulate and liberalize the provision of trans -
port services, as well as improve the quality of the
service.56 Consequently, transportation affordability
for trans port users improved due to the reduction in
fares.

Many cities (and regions) are modernizing their
fare  payment  technologies,  and  integrating  fare
systems between different public trans port routes,
modes and even operators, for users’ convenience.
Experi ence  with  the  ‘Oyster’  smartcard  ticketing
scheme in London, UK, has resulted in increased bus
patronage, due to the simpliﬁed fare system and ease
of interchange. This has also empowered commuters
with  information  on  the  range  of  fully  integrated 
fare products and improved service coordination.57
Another  positive  devel op ment  can  be  observed  in
Seoul,  Republic  of  Korea,  where  the  implementa-
tion of ‘smart cards’ allows commuters to transfer
from one mode to another at a discounted rate.58
A  recep tive  institutional  environ ment  helps  to 
create inte grated and uniﬁed tariff systems, resulting
in  cost-effectiveness  in  ticketing.  An  exemplary 
model is Germany’s transport federa tions (verkehrs -
verbund).59

n Improving affordability through urban form

and land use

The affordability of urban mobility can be increased
by improving land-use accessibility, and addressing
the physical separation of activities and the means
by  which  distance  can  be  reduced.  The  intention 
is to build sus tain able mobility into the patterns of
urban form and layouts, and make public transport,
pedestrian and bicycle use practical and affordable.
Accessibility planning60 offers a new way to ensure
that  urban  residents  can  reach  the  services  and
facilities  they  need  by  walking,  cycling  and  public
transport.  Box  6.5  presents  institutional  arrange -
ments  created  in  Atlanta,  US,  that  allow  for  the
coordination of land-use and trans port infra struc ture
investments, which could improve affordability and
accessibility, particularly for ethnic minorities.

The integration of land use and travel-demand
management  measures  can  substantially  enhance
accessibility and lead to improved public trans port
affordability. Curitiba, Brazil, is a case in point, with
40  years  of  carefully  integrating  urbanization  and
transportation  improvements.61 By  replacing  cars
with  people,  Curitiba  has  evolved  along  ﬁve  well-
deﬁned linear corridors that protect the city centre.
Zoning  laws  encourage  high-density  commercial
devel op ment  along  these  trans port  corridors,  thus
reducing the amount of travel needed to access basic
goods, services and activities. Mini buses are used to
quickly  and  efﬁciently  trans port  individuals  from
residential  neigh bour hoods  to  express  bus  lines.
Compared  with  other  Brazilian  cities  of  its  size,
Curitiba uses 30 percent less petrol per capita, and
affordable fares make it possible for the average low-
income family to spend around 10 per cent of its

Box 6.5  Metropolitan regional trans port plans and priorities, Atlanta, US

The State of Georgia and the Atlanta metropolitan region have
experi enced constant growth since the 1990s. Suburban areas
continue to expand, resulting in large-scale needs for trans port
infra struc ture projects. However, this urban sprawl
encourages disinvestment in housing and infra struc ture
decline, placing a strain on the provision of public trans port
services, particularly in older inner-city areas where African
Americans and other minorities are concentrated.

Recognizing the spatial distribution (and economic and

environ mental impact) of highway spending, there is a growing
need for Atlanta’s metropolitan region to connect its evolving
plans for infra struc ture investment with the realities of land-
use patterns. The regional trans port plan for 2000–2025 helps
guide the prioritization and funding of transportation
investments. It has been hailed as ‘an excellent example to
illustrate how the metropolitan growth can be managed by
proper land use-transportation planning and policy-making
without compromising sus tain ability’.a However, Atlanta’s

regional transportation policies have actually exacerbated
sprawl-related problems, with unintended consequences that
are not evenly distributed. The trans port strategies were
designed to serve commuters from distant (more afﬂuent)
suburbs, with no provision for reverse commute that might
help lower-income (primarily African American) communities
reach suburban employment opportunities (for example as
domestic workers, gardeners, etc., in the more afﬂuent
suburban households).

This resulted in a lawsuit and subsequent

reconsideration of objectives. US$300 million state funds
allocated to the proposed sprawl-inducing road programme
was redirected to public transport, footpaths, bicycle paths
and road safety and maintenance projects. It also led the
federal govern ment to scrutinize the distribution of
transportation beneﬁts and burdens among ethnic groups in
the Atlanta metropolitan region.

income on transportation, which is relatively low in
Brazil.62

Public  support  for  suitable  low-cost  housing
near large employment centres, or for public trans -
port is a fundamental aspect of land-use planning.
Singapore  has  successfully  created  self-sufﬁcient 
new towns (in terms of jobs) and is systematically
addressing  the  housing  needs  of  the  poor.63 The
regional centres are planned as commercial centres
surrounded by high-density housing, integrated with
an efﬁcient public trans port system. Improving the
variety of services within the neigh bour hood can be
an effective way of reducing the trans port expendi -
ture of low-income households. However, the Singa -
pore experi ence may not be readily applicable to cities
suffering urban sprawl, with low-density suburbs.

Linking  urban  mobility  systems  and  housing
policy makes good ﬁnan cial sense. Together, trans -
portation and housing often make up a good half or
more of household consumption expenditures. To the
degree less is spent on transport, more income is
freed  up  for  housing  consumption.  This  is  partly 
the  philosophy  of  Europe’s  successful  car-sharing
schemes. Location-efﬁcient mortgage policies in the
US encourage residents to live in high-density, high-
accessibility areas that reduce their need for cars.64
They allow a household to commit what it saves from
not owning a car to buy a more expensive home in
an area marked by location efﬁciency.65

VULNERABLE AND 
DIS ADVAN TAGED GROUPS
AND URBAN MOBILITY
Vulnerable  and  dis advan taged  groups  –  women,
ethnic  minorities,  elderly,  disabled  people,  youth,
children, etc. – stand to gain important social beneﬁts
from improved urban mobility networks, technologies
and facilities, as improved access and mobility reduce
isolation,  vulnerability  and  dependency.  However,
mobility networks will need to cater to the speciﬁc
needs  of  such  groups  if  they  are  to  access  the
beneﬁts.66 Even in well-functioning public trans port
systems, some passen gers may be unable to afford
the  services  offered.  Further more,  it  may  also  be
difﬁcult for some to travel alone due to poor security,
or  the  public  trans port service  may  be  physically
inaccessible for many elderly and disabled persons.
Vulnerable  and  dis advan taged  groups  are  often
overrepresented  as  pedestrians,  and  their  special
needs  as  pedestrians  should  be  considered.  For
example,  elderly  and  disabled  persons  often  face
challenges in crossing roads or navigating congested
pavements.

This  section  outlines  the  determinants  of  the
travel  behaviour  of  vulnerable  and  dis advan taged
groups.  It  identiﬁes  global  conditions,  trends,

challenges and impacts faced by these segments of
the urban population. It also considers the extent to
which urban mobility policies address or conﬂict with
the different activity needs of such passen ger groups.

Global conditions, trends and challenges
Worldwide, societies are gendered, in that men and
women  often  play  different  roles.  In  developed
countries, women’s commuting patterns are often
different from men’s, particularly if they are married
with children. They are also most likely to ‘trip-chain’,
implying  that  when  travelling,  they  have  multiple
purposes and destinations within one trip.67 This is
partly due to time constraints, and the fact that they
normally have less access to both private and public
transport. The situation is further compounded by
age.  On  average,  women  are  more  likely  to  be
working in part-time and lower-wage jobs than men,
contributing further to women’s increased expendi -
ture in terms of time spent travelling. In the EU for
example, 31.9 per cent of employed women were
working part-time in 2010, compared to only 8.7 per
cent  of  men.68 Further more,  available  evidence
suggests  that  across  the  globe,  the  percentage  of
women working in transport-related employment is
low;  with  those  employed  in  the  trans port  sector
earning 20 per cent less than men.69

While  presenting  similar  gender  differences,
women’s travel patterns in devel op ing countries are
affected by their multiple roles as income earners,
childcare providers, household managers and main -
tainers of community networks.70 Whether in urban
or peri-urban areas, women tend to make more trips,
although over shorter distances, than men. Table 6.3
provides  an  overview  of  women’s  urban  travel
patterns and constraints in devel op ing countries.

High costs of public trans port can make such
services particularly prohibitive for women when it
comes to reaching places of work, education or basic
services. A study in Kampala, Uganda, revealed that
women  spend  approximately  29  per  cent  of  their
income  on  public  transport.71 As  a  result,  women
appear  to  work  closer  to  home  than  men.72 Also,
women tend to walk, and they rely on public trans -
port primarily for longer distances.

Signiﬁcant levels of sexual harassment of women
on  urban  public  trans port systems  are  frequently
reported from numerous cities. For example, a Tokyo
Metropolitan  govern ment  survey  of  women  who
travel during rush hour in Tokyo, revealed that two-
thirds of the women in the 20–30 age group said
they had been groped on crowded trains.73 In many
cities with Islamic populations, the situation is further
exacerbated by the social institution of pardah, which
prohibits the mixing of men and women in public.74
In Dhaka, Bangladesh, women’s exclusion from public
trans port results  from  over crowded  buses,  public
sexual harassment (referred to as ‘Eve teasing’) and

inadequate sidewalks that hinder their access to the
workplace.75 Markedly,  women  will  change  their
trans port behaviour and have their trans port options
constrained if they perceive urban trans port to be
unsafe.76

Further more, evidence suggests that the plan -
ning,  provision  and  operation  of  public  trans port
in  particular  –  and  urban  mobility  in  general  –  is
primarily undertaken by men. Given that ‘women’s
travel patterns are different from men’s, and these
differences are characterized by deep and persistent
inequalities . . . [whereby they] have inferior access
to  both  private  and  public  means  of  transport’77
there  is  a  strong  case  for  main streaming  gender
concerns  in  the  working  ethos  of  urban  trans port
organizations.78

The mobility needs of children and youth (Box
6.6)  are  primarily  related  to  their  need  to  access
educational  facilities  and  childcare  and  related

the age of 18 in developed and devel op ing countries
alike  are  unable  to  drive.79 Thus,  someone  has  to

provide them with transportation, when distance and
other factors become barriers. In most countries, the
greatest burden of this passen ger-serving trip-making
falls on women.80

Across  the  globe,  evidence  suggests  that
children’s travel needs have a signiﬁcant impact on
household  travel  patterns,  due  to  the  largely  car-
dependent nature of those needs. This partly reﬂects
the parents’ perceptions of trafﬁc danger, which are
supported  by  statistics  on  accident  rates  involving
children,  particularly  when  they  are  walking  or
cycling. In South Africa, more than 26 child deaths
per  100,000  population  occur  as  a  result  of  road
trafﬁc crashes, compared to 1.7 per 100,000 in the
EU. In Bangladesh one in every four road deaths and
one in six serious injuries experi enced by the poor
involves a child.81

With respect to education, the major cause of
drop-outs in primary schools in devel op ing countries
is the distance that children have to walk to reach
their schools. Studies in Nepal show that for every
kilometre a child walks to school, the likelihood of
school  attendance  drops  by  2.5  per  cent.82 This
ﬁgure rises for girls and children with disabilities.
Fatigue,  exhaustion  and  risk  of  dangers,  such  as
sexual assault, are some of the contributory factors
to non-attendance or irregular attendance.83

Public and informal motorized trans port provides
greater mobility and a means of independent travel
for youth. Whereas a majority of developed countries
have  dedicated  school  bus  services  in  prominent
schools, the poorest are often dependent on public
and informal transport. In the context of devel op ing
countries,  typical  problems  of  informal  trans port
parallel  those  of  public  trans port
related  to

Box 6.6 Children and youth: Population trends

As indicated in Figure 6.1, children and youth contribute a
steadily diminishing proportion of populations world-wide.
While 34.3 per cent of the global population were under the
age of 15 in 1950, this ﬁgure has decreased to 26.2 per cent in
2013, and is projected to decline further to 20.5 per cent by
2050. It should be noted, however, that at the same time, the
total population of children and youth under the age of 15 has
more than doubled, from 869 million in 1950 to 1866 million

in 2013. Projections indicate that the population below the age
of 15 will stabilize at about 1.9 billion by the year 2050.

A similar trend can be seen for the 15–19 age group,

where the global population has nearly tripled from 239
million in 1950 (9.4 per cent of world total) to 601 million in
2013 (8.4 per cent of world total), and is expected to grow
slowly to 628 million by 2050 (6.7 per cent of world total).

Colombo (Sri Lanka) and Faisalabad (Pakistan), trans -
port  operators  will  not  ferry  school  children  and
pensioners on concessionary fares, and/or they break
their journey arbitrarily to ensure a double payment.84
It has been estimated that there are more than
1  billion  people  in  the  world  with  some  form  of
disability (i.e. 15.3 per cent of the global popula-
tion). Among these, ‘nearly 200 million experi ence
considerable difﬁculties in functioning’85 (i.e. 2.9 per
cent of the population). As can be seen from Table
6.4, the prevalence of disability is generally higher
in devel op ing countries than in developed countries
and highest among older persons. More than half of
the population aged 60 years or older in many devel -
op ing countries are suffering from moderate or severe
disabilities, compared to about a third in developed
countries.

People with disabilities often ﬁnd trans port to
be  limited,  unaffordable  or  inaccessible,  and  fre -
quently cite lack of adequate trans port as a barrier
to  accessing  healthcare.86 In  the  years  ahead,  dis -
ability  will  become  an  even  greater  concern.  This 
is due to ageing populations and the higher risk of
disability  in  older  people,  as  well  as  the  global
increase  in  chronic  health  conditions  such  as  dia -
betes,  cardiovascular  disease,  cancer  and  mental
health disorders. Since 1950, the proportion of older
persons (i.e. those aged 60 or more) has been rising
steadily, from 8.1 per cent in 1950 to 11.7 per cent
in 2013, and is expected to reach 21.8 per cent in

2050 (Figure 6.2). By 2050, it is estimated that 3.2
million people will be over 100 years old; of which
1.3  million  will  live  in  devel op ing  countries.87
Whereas mobility is important for daily living, many
people who have got used to driving their own cars
will have to stop driving due to age-related disabilities.
The  challenges  faced  by  these  people  vary
considerably, due to the different types of disabilities
and their impact on mobility. For example, hearing-
impaired and vision-impaired persons in wheelchairs
face different obstacles and thus need a variety of
assistance methods.88 Their movement is impaired
by steps, stairways, etc., which require redesign of
ﬂoor  space  requirements  and  facilities.89 Further -
more, where there is no pedestrian infra struc ture –
such as signage or zebra crossings – they may need
to travel with an escort, or use special guidance equip -
ment.  Older  persons  and  persons  with  dis abilities

Planning and Design for Sustainable Urban Mobility

The participation
of women
transport users is
critical for the
establishment of
equitable practice
and the
development of
gender-sensitive
understanding of
transport needs
and systems

would thus beneﬁt from design modiﬁcations such
as better information systems and low-ﬂoor vehicles.90
Privately run services such as shared taxis and mini -
buses are preferred by older and disabled persons
due  to  their  demand  for  door-to-door  services.
Nevertheless, most of these vehicles are not able to
accommodate the users of wheelchairs and can be
prohibitively costly. The alternative of hiring private
trans port is often out of the price range of disabled
people, and parking spaces exclusively for their use
in the central city are limited.

While  many  countries  have  legislative  frame -
works  requiring  these  challenges  be  addressed,
effective responses are limited. African countries in
particular suffer from insufﬁcient monitoring, imple -
mentation and realization of such legislation.91 The
adoption of the United Nations’ Standard Rules on
the Equalization of Opportunities for Persons with
Disabilities  in  199492 and  the  Convention  on  the
Rights of Persons with Disabilities in 200693 signalled
broad  international  consensus  on  how  disability
issues should be addressed. National regulations are
also in place on a country-by-country basis.

It should also be noted that many persons suffer
from several different types of vulnerability and/or
dis advan tage. Women with disabilities for example
often  suffer  compounded  discrimination  on  the
grounds of gender and available income in addition
to the impairment.

Policy responses and innovative practices
There is a wide range of policy options and initiatives
in place in some cities that have worked to improve
mobility  for  the  urban  poor  and  enhance  urban
access  for  vulnerable  and  dis advan taged  groups.
Some of the policies and programmes described here
do not require expenditure. Others could result in
savings  or  payback  from  spin-off  effects  through
more  cost-effective  management.  Cities  at  various
levels of devel op ment can draw on the experi ences

of  other  cities  for  further  devel op ment  or  for  im -
proving existing conditions. The actual design of the
policy or practice will have to be modiﬁed for the
speciﬁc circumstances of each individual city.

In  recent  years,  there  have  been  signiﬁcant
devel op ments in the methodologies associated with
gender planning in respect of accessibility, mobility
and  trans port  organization.  Evidence  shows  that
many  countries  have  integrated  gender  into  their
trans port programmes and projects.94 Opportunities
need to be provided for women to gain meaningful
and beneﬁcial employment in the trans port sector.
Hiring female bus operators was a key component
of  the  Trans  Jakarta  BRT  initiative  in  Indonesia,
which  provided  Indonesian  women  with  a  ﬁrst
opportunity of formal, regularized employment in the
sector.95 Experi ence  shows  that  increased  female
recruitment helps advance gender equality in society
in  general,  and  also  increases  women’s  level  of
comfort  and  security  in  negotiating  trans port
situations.96

Such a focus on gender issues is justiﬁed by the
fact that it enhances the effectiveness of actions in
the trans port sector, and therefore impacts on poverty
reduction. Data on user needs and access constraints
should be gender disaggregated and collected through
routine  trans port  project  monitoring  and  evalua-
tion processes.97 A recent World Bank pilot study in
Lesotho  that  promotes  the  use  of  cognitive  map-
ping  exercises  and  geographic  information  system
(GIS) for gender-sensitive trans port planning is a good
example  of  one  such  programme  to  map  targeted
stakeholder use patterns for integration with plan -
ning.98 The participation of women trans port users
is critical for the establishment of equitable practice
and  the  devel op ment  of  gender-sensitive  under -
standing of trans port needs and systems (Box 6.7).
Establishing a sus tain able urban trans port system
requires a comprehensive and integrated approach
to policy-making, with the aim of delivering people-
oriented,  affordable  and  environ mentally  friendly

Box 6.7 Women’s participation in the trans port sector in China

As part of an urban trans port project in Liaoning Province,
China, women were integrated into the various phases of the
project, with the speciﬁc aim of increasing their participation.
The project speciﬁcation was established through community
participation with separate focus groups for both men and
women. This made it possible to identify the number of
journeys made on a daily basis, which prompted priority to be
given to the issue of pavements, road drainage, hard shoulders
and their separation from the carriageway used by motor
vehicles, lighting and signing.

By providing a speciﬁc forum for women, planners
learned about speciﬁc concerns, opportunities and needs

voiced by a key stakeholder in the project that may not have
been raised in mix-gendered discussions. Women expressed
concerns about the lack of security encountered in using
buses: dark alleys, lengthy waiting times and vulnerability to
trafﬁc accident and injury. The outcome led to changes being
made to the initial project in order to hasten improvements to
secondary roads and trafﬁc management. Precedence was
given to the creation of pathways and pedestrian crossings, 
the installation of public lighting and improved frequency of
bus services.

the  design  of  new  vehicles.103 Consultations  are
carried out in relation to safety, accessibility, internal
conﬁguration  and  respect  for  the  environ ment. 
This helps to improve the gender sensitive design of
public  trans port vehicles  to  accommodate  women
with children and/or shopping bags such as women-
only carriages, child seating, storage spaces for prams
and shopping.

In many devel op ing countries, means of trans -
port such as carts, bicycles and animals are considered
a cost-effective manner to assist in meeting women’s
mobility needs.104 Bicycles have often been recom -
mended as a means of increasing the overall mobility
of women, to enhance their socioeconomic and polit -
ical participation. A study in India shows women’s
preference  for  the  door-to-door  demand  service
provided by auto-rickshaws.105 The construction of
segregated lanes for auto-rickshaws can reduce time
burdens and beneﬁt dis advan taged groups.

New  mobility  services  –  such  as  carpooling
schemes  reserved  for  women  –  are  beginning  to
thrive  throughout  North  America  and  Europe.106
Such  programmes  provide  the  convenience  of  in -
expensive access.107 Families, commuters and em -
ployers are able to share cars at different times of
the day, with subsidized or preferential parking. In
Germany, well-lit parking sections have been set aside
for women near stairs and elevators in multi-storey
parking lots to ensure their safety.108 Similarly, laws
supporting disability parking privileges ensure that
persons with disabilities have access to parking that
does not present an undue hardship. For instance,
the UK’s blue badge disabled parking scheme helps
disabled  people  with  severe  mobility  problems  to
access goods and services, by allowing them to park
close to their destination.109

Private trans port options for many elderly and
disabled  travellers  are  also  increasing  (Box  6.8).
There are a number of stable non-motorized vehicles,
such  as  three-wheeled  bicycles,  hand-operated
bicycles and a variety of carts in use. In Bangladesh,

meet the needs of the elderly and frail. Car designs need to
take the functional mobility limitations of elderly, frail and
disabled groups into account. Extensive research in road
standards is important for ﬁnding the most suitable conditions
for disabled and elderly road users.

Although the issue of aging populations has been less of a

political issue in devel op ing countries, it should be noted that
the conditions for many aging and disabled road users in such
countries are often deplorable, thus obstructing their right of
access.

mobility systems. The following sections give practical
examples  of  policy  responses  that  seek  to  deliver
transportation that is gender sensitive, efﬁcient, safe
and responsive to the mobility needs of vulnerable
and dis advan taged groups.

n Gender-sensitive design, infra struc ture and

services

Public transportation planning must be based on a
recognition of the distinct needs of women’s distinct
roles, needs and experi ences. As such, gender main -
streaming is essential. In Bangladesh, an Asian Devel -
op ment Bank project aims to improve infra struc ture
facilities and the design of trans port vehicles.99 The
project  takes  account  of  women’s  speciﬁc  needs
(public toilets, separate market stalls, lower steps in
buses, etc.). It also reserves 15 per cent of the small
businesses located along the roads under construction
for women.100 The small modiﬁcations made to the
existing  infra struc ture  balance  women’s  needs  for
privacy with their need for social inclusion. Further -
more,  it  begins  the  process  of  further  integrating
women into social and economic domains that are
traditionally segregated by sex, and often dominated
by men.

Other  policy  initiatives  focus  on  safeguarding
women’s  safety  and  comfort  in  urban  transport.
Passen ger rail cars reserved for ‘women only’ have
been implemented in Japan, Brazil, Egypt, Mexico,
India, Belarus and the Philippines. Similarly, women-
only taxis are found in countries with large Islamic
populations, such as Lebanon, Syria and the United
Arab  Emirates.101 Most  of  these  cabs  are  clearly
marked in pink and feature women drivers. Whereas
such sex-segregated initiatives are often debated, they
have  undoubtedly  improved  conditions  for  female
passen gers.102

In France, rolling stock manufacturers pledge to
follow a charter proposed by an association called
Femmes en mouvement, les transports au féminin,
which requires the association to be present during

Box 6.8 Private trans port for special groups

Many cities, particularly in developed countries, promote the
use of private trans port for disabled people by licensing the
use of scooters, motorized three-wheelers or electric
wheelchairs. Further more, street or pavement designs are
modiﬁed to accept them. In Belgium, loans and grants are
provided for car-adaptation and training costs, both of which
allow disabled people to enter the labour force. In many parts
of the world, protected right or left turns are used as a safety
measure particularly for the elderly, as well as designated
turning lanes which aid in channelling the disabled away from
through-trafﬁc.

Many elderly people prefer to use private motor

vehicles; however, the standards therein need to be tailored to

hand-propelled  tricycles  provide  valuable  local
mobility and are environ mentally friendly.110 Other
motorized  vehicles  on  the  market  include  electric
wheelchairs, three-wheeled motorized vehicles and
cars and vans with hand controls.

Fare structures allow govern ments to determine
who pays and who beneﬁts.111 In countries such as
the  UK,  Denmark,  Spain  (Madrid)  and  Mexico
(Mexico  City),  just  to  mention  a  few,  special
categories of passen gers – such as students, children,
the elderly and the unemployed – travel free or at
least at a reduced fare.112 There is a strong case for
cross-subsidies to increase affordability, as has been
done in Bogotá, Colombia, where the fare for low-
income groups is subsidized by that of higher-income
groups.113 Integrated fare structures make it relatively
easy and less expensive for vulnerable and dis advan -
taged groups to travel, particularly when undertaking
trip-chains. For example, in Denmark, ﬁnan cial grants
from the govern ment have allowed integration of train
and  regional  bus  services,  enabling  passen gers
crossing regional borders to use a single ticket – even
if the journey requires a transfer involving different
public  trans port companies.  Similar  grants  have
allowed free public trans port for children under the
age of 12 who are accompanied by an adult.114

n Increasing pedestrian accessibility and safety
Building exclusive sidewalks as components of road
and  trans port  projects  responds  well  to  women’s 
and other vulnerable users’ travel needs by increasing
pedestrian  accessibility  and  safety.  A  majority  of
cities in developed countries have launched a curb-
cut programme whereby all new sidewalks will be
built with curb cuts that allow wheeled pedestrian
trafﬁc  to  negotiate  the  height  change  comfortably
while at the same time helping sight-impaired people
identify the street margin when using walking aids
such as a cane.115 Cities such as Mexico City, Rio de
Janeiro  (Brazil)  and  Pretoria  (South  Africa)  have
installed  thousands  of  curb  cuts  to  existing
footways.116 Agencies such as the World Bank are also
increasing their focus on improving infra struc ture for
non-motorized transport.117

In Tokyo, Japan, a textured surface identiﬁes the
change  in  level,  including  the  direction,  of  the
pedestrian crossing.118 The textured area is bright

yellow and clearly visible, with curb cuts installed in
existing sidewalks. At key intersections, the timings
of the pedestrian crossing lights have been increased
by 20 per cent to accommodate the slower crossing
speed of elderly or disabled pedestrians.119 Locations
for  the  installation  of  light  and  sound  signals  for
pedestrian  crossings  are  also  identiﬁed.  Different
sounds inform pedestrians whether or not it is safe
to cross and whether they are crossing in an east to
west direction or a north to south direction.120 In
Ottawa, Canada, for example, ‘peep-peep’ sounds are
used for east to west crossings and ‘cuckoo’ sounds
for north to south.121 Pedestrians may press a button
to  activate  the  pedestrian  crossing  light.  In  some
cases,  where  there  is  sufﬁcient  wheelchair  trafﬁc,
wheelchair sensors may be installed.

The make-up of streets and the built environ -
ment can play a role in physical activity promotion
and  active  travel  behaviours,  especially  among
children  to  and  from  school.122 For  instance,  the
availability of paved roads had a signiﬁcant inﬂuence
in  school  attendance  levels  in  a  community  in
Morocco. Attendance rates rose from 21 per cent to
48 per cent for girls and from 58 per cent to 76 per
cent for boys.123 School travel is an opportunity to
shift a portion of car trips to walking and cycling, if
accessibility,  safety  and  the  social  beneﬁts  of  the
experi ence are recognized and addressed.

n ‘Universal design’ or ‘access for all’
Across  the  globe,  many  countries  are  introducing
legislation  that  requires  trans port  services  to  be
made more accessible, to conform to international
law (Box 6.9). South Africa, for example, has adopted
an integrated national disability strategy committed
to  devel op ing  accessible  and  affordable  public
transport. In 2010, the UK govern ment passed an
act  that  covers  accessibility  issues  related  to  age,
ethnicity,  gender  and  disability  as  part  of  a  single
integrated approach to ensure equal access for all.124
In Europe, and more recently in North America,
access to urban public trans port has been transformed
by the introduction of low-ﬂoor vehicles.125 Passen -
gers in wheelchairs can board the bus via a simple
ramp or directly from the sidewalk if the curb is raised
at  stops.  Inside  the  bus,  there  is  space  to  park
wheelchairs and strollers, where they can be secured

Box 6.9 Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (Article 9, paragraph 1)

‘To enable persons with disabilities to live independently and participate fully in all aspects of life, States Parties shall take
appropriate measures to ensure to persons with disabilities access, on an equal basis with others, to the physical environ ment, to
transportation, . . . and to other facilities and services open or provided to the public. . . . These measures, which shall include the
identiﬁcation and elimination of obstacles and barriers to accessibility, shall apply to, inter alia: (a) Buildings, roads, transportation
and other indoor and outdoor facilities, including schools, housing, medical facilities and workplaces’.

with a clamp belt. This caters for people with small
children or baggage, persons with disabilities and frail
elderly persons.

In Delhi, India, a local NGO has worked with
trans port authorities to make metro stations barrier
free;  to  include  safety  features  and  tactile  guide
ways126 on platforms; and to ensure carriages have
adequate space for wheelchair users.127 Similarly, a
forum bringing together an advocacy group for the
disabled in Mexico City has led to thousands of kerb
ramps  on  major  streets  and  the  introduction  of
accessible buses and trolley buses.128

Accessible taxis, both purpose-built and modiﬁed
vans, are also becoming more prevalent. In Canada,
the Province of Ontario offers a grant to adapt taxis
to accommodate all users.129 Private-sector companies
may  adapt  one  or  more  of  their  ﬂeet  and  provide
regular  service  and  they  send  accessible  taxis  to
disabled passen gers who call for them. A variation
on taxi service is the ‘Dial-a-ride’ service that works
in many cities in the US and the UK.130 In Berlin, a
‘telebus’ operates on the same principle.131 Often,
disabled  passen gers  are  given  a  ‘travel  card’  and
then allowed a certain number of rides.

Some attempts have also been made to ensure
that information is availed to passen gers in an easily
understood manner. For instance, a number of taxis
in Hong Kong have audio devices that provide the
taxi fare in English, Putonghua and Cantonese.132 It
is also important that authorities promote disability
awareness and training of public trans port drivers and
conductors  to  improve  the  assistance  they  offer
passen gers with special needs. Part of Mexico City’s
public information campaign aims to raise awareness
among the general public about the integrated system
of accessible pedestrian and trans port services in the
city. Sensitivity training for taxi drivers has also been
considered.133

SAFETY AND SECURITY 
IN URBAN MOBILITY
SYSTEMS
Safety and security are key components in creating
sus tain able urban  mobility  systems,  particularly  in
making roads safer and more secure for vulnerable
and  dis advan taged  road  users,  including  the  poor.
Likewise, improving the safety and security of trans -
port modes can be an extremely important step in
encouraging  trans port  users  to  change  to  alterna-
tive (and more sus tain able) modes. Numerous terror
attacks against urban infra struc ture during the last
two decades have compelled stakeholders to under -
stand trans port security as more than a single element
of  the  global  networks  that  move  people  and 
goods.134 Once  a  routine  component  of  modern
trans portation,  security  now  represents  an  urgent
national priority.

Global conditions, trends and challenges
This  section  examines  the  trends  and  impacts  of
trafﬁc  accidents  in  urban  areas.135 It  considers
reducing the global burden of such accidents through
improved policies, road design and safety and trafﬁc
management. It also looks at transportation security
more  generally,  in  terms  of  people’s  (real  or  per -
ceived) assessments of personal security. Due to the
paucity of data on urban areas, this section refers to
road trafﬁc accident data at the national level.

n Road trafﬁc accidents
Road  trafﬁc  accidents  are  the  ninth  leading  cause 
of death worldwide, accounting for 2.2 per cent of
all deaths or 1.2 million deaths per year. The WHO
estimates that a further 20–50 million are injured in
road trafﬁc crashes each year. The highest road trafﬁc
fatality  rates  occur  in  Africa  and  the  Middle  East
(about  32  per  year  per  100,000  population).  The
average  road  trafﬁc  fatality  rate  of  devel op ing
countries (about 20 per year per 100,000 population)
is nearly twice that of developed countries. In fact,
more than 90 per cent of fatalities occur in devel op -
ing countries,136 despite the fact that these countries
have only 33 per cent of all registered vehicles.137
About  half  of  the  fatalities  are  in  the  most
productive age group (15–44 years). In the 15–29
years age group, road trafﬁc accidents are the leading
cause of death. Males are overrepresented among
fatalities in all age groups.138 The most vulnerable
road users – pedestrians, cyclists and motorized two-
wheelers – account for nearly half of all road trafﬁc
fatalities. And, as can be seen from Figure 6.3, the
proportion of fatalities among such vulnerable users
is signiﬁcantly higher in devel op ing countries than
in developed countries.

The  predominance  of  vulnerable  road-user
casualties  in  Asian  and  African  countries  can  be
attributed  to  the  unique  trafﬁc  mix  on  the  roads,
characterized by the abundance of vehicles and non-
motorized transport, as well as a lack of segregated
facilities in the road network.139 Poor enforcement
of  trafﬁc  safety  regulations  due  to  inadequate
resources, administrative problems and corruption,
exacerbate  the  situation  further.140 Arguably,  the
number of accidents and fatalities is likely to increase
before they can be reduced, placing a strain on the
poor  public  health  infra struc ture  in  devel op ing
countries. In India, road trafﬁc injury patients account
for  10–30  per  cent  of  all  admissions  to  surgical
wards.141 Delays  in  emergency  response  time  can
compromise  the  patient’s  recovery,  resulting  in
adverse  health  outcomes  and  long-term  disability.
Further more, lack of trained expertise in trauma care,
in  many  devel op ing  countries  in  particular,  often
results in treatable injuries becoming permanent or
life  threatening.142 The  annual  cost  of  road  trafﬁc
accidents in devel op ing countries has been estimated

as at least US$100 billion a year.143 Add to this the
already considerable cost of congestion in cities, and
the  combined  cost  of  a  lack  of  road  safety  and
accessibility is daunting.

Older pedestrians are also associated with very
high rates of road injury and death. In 2002, some
194,000 older persons (aged 60 years and above) died
as  a  result  of  road  trafﬁc  accidents;  this  ﬁgure  is
equivalent  to  16  per  cent  of  all  such  fatalities
globally.144 Despite elderly drivers having the lowest
crash rates of all age groups, there is a widespread
misconception  that  they  are  a  threat  to  trafﬁc
safety.145 In Japan, for instance, incentives such as
discounts in restaurants are offered to elderly drivers
aged 65 years and above to encourage them to give
up their licenses.146

Trans port safety is not limited to private motor -
ized vehicles only. Some 88 per cent of all motorized
travel in Mumbai, India, is by bus or rail.147 Accidents
at railway level crossings clearly dominate the railway
accident  picture  in  Asia,  where  they  are  more
frequent and can also be more severe in their conse -
quences, involving injuries and fatalities to railway
passen gers, road vehicle occupants and other users
of  railway  level  crossings.  In  several  devel op ing
countries, passen gers in buses and informal trans port
systems also constitute a signiﬁcant group at high risk
of  road  trafﬁc  casualties.148 Along  with  the  proﬁt
motive  of  overloading,  additional  factors  such  as
reckless  driving,  poor  driver  training  and  driver
fatigue have led to the increased fatalities.

Most  countries  have  some  form  of  national
system for aggregating data on road crashes, using
police  or  hospital  records,  or  both.  However,  the
quality and reliability of data on trafﬁc accidents is
particularly weak in devel op ing countries.149 There
is  thus  an  urgent  need  for  an  effective  system  of
accident recording and analysis that would be useful
for a range of agencies (police, judiciary, emergency
personnel, etc.).

n Transportation security: Risks and fears

related to the use of public transport

Across  the  globe,  security  risks  and  fear  of  crime
while engaged in transportation activities have sky-
rocketed.  The  terrorist  attacks  in  Madrid,  Spain
(March  2004)150 and  London,  UK  (July  2005)151
show that public trans port systems are vulnerable and
potential targets for terrorists. Trans port hubs and
facilities have come under terrorist attacks as they
concentrate large numbers of people. When attacks
occur, there are disruptions in the public trans port
service,  which  leave  many  commuters  stranded.
Evidence  suggests  that  passen gers’  conﬁdence  in
the London metro and buses declined, and instead
preference was given to two-wheelers and bicycles.152
While the most dramatic attacks have occurred
mostly on major systems in major cities, this does
not  mean  that  local  bus  services  or  smaller  cities 
are safe from attack. Crimes ostensibly unrelated to
the use of public trans port – such as being robbed
or  killed  while  waiting  at  a  bus  stop  –  discourage
many people from using public transport. Table 6.5
summarizes the four main types of threats to security
of  person  and  property.  In  each  case,  while  the
origin of the problem may not lie primarily in trans -
port conditions, questions arise about the planning
and  management  of  transportation  facilities  and
services. Sexual harassment is widespread in many
countries on and around public trans port facilities,
and  inadequate  street  lighting  and  poor  design  of
public  trans port stops  tends  to  ‘facilitate’  sexual
harassment and gender violence.153

A  growing  phenomenon  in  many  cities  is  the
expansion of criminal gangs that extort money from
trans port operators and passen gers. Nairobi, Kenya,
for  instance,  has  seen  the  emergence  of  criminal
youth gangs such as Mungiki. In April 2003, over 50
armed Mungiki members attacked a matatu (mini -
bus) crew, killing ﬁve people.154 These are indications
of  widespread  social  malaise.  While  it  affects  the

trans port  behaviour  of  everybody,  in  most  cases,
low-income groups cannot afford alternatives.155 As
a  result,  indispensable  trips  for  work,  health  or
education are reduced.

It  is  also  well  established  that  older  persons 
have higher safety and security concerns than other
age groups.156 Many are aware of their frailty and
vulnerability, which make them susceptible to certain
forms of crime (such as bag snatching). This in itself
generates a range of safety concerns (i.e. road safety,
skateboard  users  in  shopping  malls,  living  alone,
etc.)  that  have 
implications  for  policy  and
operations.157

Policy responses and innovative 
practices
This section explores policy responses and examples
of  good  practice  initiatives  to  reduce  trafﬁc  acci-
dents  and  improve  road  safety  and  transportation
security. It should be stressed that the type of trafﬁc,
the  mix  of  different  categories  of  road  users,  and 
the type of road trafﬁc accidents in devel op ing coun -
tries  differ  signiﬁcantly  from  those  in  developed
countries. Further more, the trafﬁc patterns of devel -
op ing countries today have never been experi enced
by developed countries in the past. Hence, technol -
ogies and policies cannot be automatically transferred
from  developed  to  devel op ing  countries  without
adaptation.

n Reducing road trafﬁc accidents
Most  developed  countries  have  been  experiment-
ing with radical measures to reduce the number and
severity of road trafﬁc accidents. Based on a com -
bination of engineering, enforcement and education
measures, improvements have been made in infra -
struc ture design; vehicle characteristics (e.g. seatbelt
use, enacted by 57 per cent of countries surveyed
by  the  WHO158);  and  driving  behaviour  (including
speed  limits  and  campaigns  to  dissuade  drunk-
driving). An estimated 96 per cent of countries have
a  national  or  sub-national  policy  on  drinking  and
driving. Further more, some 49 per cent of countries

have restrictions on the blood alcohol concentration
of drivers.159 Sweden’s ‘vision zero’ initiative is exem -
plary, with a clear vision of reducing trafﬁc accidents
to zero in the near future. Some three-quarters of
the signiﬁcant reduction of deaths and injuries on
Swedish roads have been attributed to the effects 
of the implemented trafﬁc-calming measures.160 A key
lesson  from  these  experi ences,  however,  is  the
importance of maintaining the goodwill of all road
users.161

In  devel op ing  countries,  the  policy  focus  has
been  on  the  protection  of  poor  people  who  are
disproportionately affected by road trafﬁc accidents
owing to the mixture of vehicles and unprotected
road  users  on  the  same  roads  (Box  6.10).  Simple, 
low-cost  interventions  have  been  found  to  have 
a  signiﬁcant  impact  on  their  safety.  For  example, 
in  Accra  and  Kumasi  (Ghana)  the  introduction  of
speed bumps in the form of rumble strips and speed
humps  resulted  in  a  35  per  cent  drop  in  road 
crashes between 2000 and 2001.162 Road designers
in  Malaysia  are  working  towards  new  regulatory
guidelines requiring pedes trian risk assessments in
order to separate road users.163

With  respect  to  new  transportation  projects,
mandatory safety audit procedures have existed in a
number  of  countries  (including  Australia,  Den-
mark, New Zealand and the UK) for several years.164

Box 6.10 Rwanda’s road-safety programme

After the genocide that plunged Rwanda into mourning in
1994, the nation embarked on the improvement of its road
infra struc ture that was damaged by the effects of war,
leading to many road trafﬁc deaths. New regulations were
enforced in 2001, which included the mandatory wearing of
seatbelts, speed limits, vehicle inspections to ensure
standards of roadworthiness and limits on blood-alcohol
concentrations. These legislative changes were followed up
in 2003 by a public awareness campaign and a law
introducing further penalties for lack of seatbelt use or

failure to wear helmets on motorcycles. This led to a 30 per
cent reduction in trafﬁc accidents.

The Rwandese govern ment also introduced national

speed limits of 60 kilometres per hour, which is 20 kilometres
per hour lower than neigh bouring countries. Plans to extend
this successful programme of road-safety measures include
further reinforcements for the trafﬁc police to better enforce
the law, as well as more public education about how to
prevent accidents and observe good conduct.

Box 6.11 Toolkits for road safety

The International Road Assessment Programme (iRAP) has
developed a toolkit that rates roads according to criteria for
safety design, maps fatalities and serious injuries across the
road network, and makes cost/beneﬁt calculations for 
fatality reductions based on implementation of proposed
countermeasures. It then applies tailored solutions. The 
iRAP methodology provides:

•

‘Star rating’ tables and maps showing the safety of roads or
car occupants, motorcyclist, cyclists and pedestrians.

• A road inventory database with 30 inspected attributes

describing the network.

• An estimate of the numbers being killed and seriously

injured on each inspected road.

• A recommended network-wide countermeasure

programme for consideration by local stakeholders and
funding bodies.

In Malaysia, it has been estimated that an investment of
US$180 million in road design improvements could deliver
US$3 billion in beneﬁts and prevent over 30,000 deaths and
serious injuries over 20 years. iRAP has pilot projects in 
Chile, Costa Rica, Malaysia and South Africa showing positive
cost–beneﬁt ratios. Positive economic outcomes combined
with the alleviation of human suffering make investment in
safer roads a devel op ment priority.

The enforcement

Trafﬁc calming

reduce the
vulnerability of
pedestrians and
cyclists to road
trafﬁc accidents

Such procedures are also at various phases of imple -
mentation  in  devel op ing  countries  such  as  India,
South Africa and Thailand.165

The enforcement of trafﬁc regulations, govern-
ing all road users and vehicles, is essential for the
safety of cyclists, other non-motorized vehicle users
and motorcyclists. In Iran, a law was passed in 2004,
making the use of helmets compulsory countrywide
for motorcycle users. By 2007, fatalities per 100,000
inhabitants  decreased  from  38.2  to  31.8.  Some 
40 per cent of countries surveyed by the WHO have
a comprehensive motorcycle helmet law, in which
some  countries  have  clearly  deﬁned  standards  for
both  motorcycle  drivers  and  their  passen gers.166
Exclusive  motorcycle  lanes  can  be  created  and
separated from the main carriageway by a physical
median, as observed in Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia). Box
6.11 presents a toolkit for addressing road safety.

Most  countries  provide  some  pedestrian
facilities, but in most cases the road environ ment is
not  designed  with  pedestrians  in  mind.  In  many
developed countries ‘pedestrian refuges’ – elevated
islands designed usually in the middle of streets –
are  a  common  feature  to  offer  pedestrian  safety
when crossing the road. Such crossings are rare in
devel op ing countries. Instead, zebra crossings (where

pedestrians are supposed to be granted immediate
priority over approaching vehicles) are provided in
some devel op ing countries. Other low-cost pedestrian
facilities – which are affordable at a wide scale and
can  be  easily  implemented  –  include  pedestrian
footways, controlled signals for at-grade pedestrian
crossings, grade-separated crossings, and segregated
bicycle lanes. As evidenced by pilot projects, trafﬁc
calming and the redesign of roads can reduce the
vulnerability of pedestrians and cyclists to road trafﬁc
accidents.167

Other  effective  interventions  for  road  safety
include better land-use management for optimized
trafﬁc ﬂow and the promotion of alternative modes
of transportation such as public trans port (Box 6.12).
For instance, Singapore has been successful in reduc -
ing  car  journeys  and  alleviating  trafﬁc  congestion
through  a  combination  of  integrated  land-use  and
trans port planning, and demand-management meas -
ures. This  can  help  to  reduce  trafﬁc  accidents  by
minimizing  the  number  and  length  of  motorized
trips.168 Similarly, in Brazil, Curitiba’s high-capacity
trafﬁc-management  system  has  not  only  improved
urban trans port and mobility but has also reduced
the number of accidents along its routes, through the
construction of safer infra struc ture.169 Higher occu -

Box 6.12 Reducing road trafﬁc fatalities in Bogotá, Colombia

Since 1993, Colombian legislation requires all vehicle owners
to be insured. As a result, a 3 per cent levy was instituted on
all vehicle insurance policies, earmarking that money for a
‘road accident prevention fund’. This resulted in Colombia’s
time-record high for the reduction of trafﬁc fatalities – 7874 
in 1995.

In Bogotá, several programmes have been introduced to
prevent and mitigate road trafﬁc deaths and injury. Typically,

bars are closed at 1am instead of 3am, and citizens are
cautioned against driving under the inﬂuence of alcohol. The
stiff penalties deter people, who instead opt for alternative
means of transportation (such as carpooling), resulting in the
reduction of road trafﬁc fatalities in Bogotá from 1387 in 1995
to 697 in 2002.

pancy vehicles are given priority in the road network,
thus reducing the exposure risk of pedestrians and
other road users. Surrounding areas have also been
improved with better lighting and other equipment
to make the trans port system safer, more efﬁcient
and more user friendly.

The  responsibility  for  regulating  trafﬁc  and
enforcing rules falls with the police. However, many
police agencies in devel op ing countries are plagued
with poor enforcement of regulations – due to a lack
of  resources,  unsatisfactory  systems  or  general
inefﬁciency on the part of the staff. Evidence suggests
that a sustained systemic approach to road policing,
with international support, can improve the perform -
ance (and image) of the police. A study of enhanced
trafﬁc enforcement in Uganda showed a 17 per cent
drop in road deaths. The implemented scheme was
worth US$72,000 and an average cost-effectiveness
of US$27 per life year saved.170

Partnerships between community groups, civil
society  and  NGOs  and  the  police  can  help  in
preventing  and  mitigating  trafﬁc  accidents,  and
enforcing trans port safety measures.171 For example,
in Bangalore, India, the World Bank’s Global Road
Safety Partnership has created partnerships to launch
a  campaign  against  drunk-driving,  and  to  improve
roadways in high-trafﬁc areas to enhance safety.172
In  addition,  the  Centres  for  Disease  Control  and
Prevention have been working with the ministries of
health and other groups in Mexico, Colombia and 
El Salvador to reduce injuries to pedestrians, cyclists
and motor-vehicle occupants.173

n Improving the safety and security of

vulnerable groups

‘Safe  route  to  school’  programmes  exist  world-
wide.174 Spearheaded by Denmark in the 1970s, the
programme  focuses  on  engineering  enforcement,
education and encouragement of safe walking and
cycling for schoolchildren.175 Under the Road Trafﬁc
Act, police and local authorities are responsible for
the  safety  of  children  on  school  journeys.  This
involves many improvements on local roads, including
slow-speed  areas,  ‘road  narrowings’,  trafﬁc  islands 
and separate foot and bicycle paths. The programme
has been highly successful, and in some localities the
accident  frequency  has  been  reduced  by  85  per
cent.176 Denmark’s  experi ence  with  these  pro -
grammes has provided an example for many other
countries worldwide.

Many  European  cities  are  working  towards
limiting  through-trafﬁc  on  their  streets  to  protect
children, deaf people and those in wheelchairs from
accidents.177 The  Netherlands  has  developed  an
amicable street-design solution for sharing of space
between pedestrian and motor trafﬁc in residential
areas.178 Selected  areas  are  designated  woonerfs
(‘living streets’) and they are clearly marked with a
trafﬁc sign based on the image of a house. The street

design  is  modiﬁed  giving  priority  to  pedestrians,
with the pavement clearly demarcating areas where
parking is acceptable. Through-trafﬁc slows down due
to  the  judicious  use  of  speed  bumps  and  winding
thoroughfares. The harshness of asphalt and concrete
is softened with amenities such as trees and ﬂower
boxes,  small  areas  where  children  may  play  and
benches  where  adults  may  meet  with  each  other. 
By  2011  it  was  estimated  that  some  20  per  cent 
of the population of the Netherlands were living in
woonerfs.179 Similar initiatives have been introduced
in  a  number  of  other  countries  as  well,  including
Norway (where they are called gatetun)180 and the
UK (‘home streets’).

Since  the  1980s,  trans port  planners  in  some
countries have taken into consideration the personal
security  of  passen gers  using  public  transportation
systems,  especially  women.  In  Toronto,  Canada,  a
‘request stop’ service was launched in 1980 for the
hours after dark, allowing a female passen ger to ask
the bus driver to stop along the route, where it is
more  convenient  for  the  woman  to  get  off,  not
neces sarily at the bus stop. This was done to shorten
the woman’s walk between bus and destination. The
service was later adopted in Montreal in 1996,181 and
later in a few UK cities.182 Other measures taken to
improve the personal safety of passen gers in Toronto
include increasing the presence of security personnel
in stations, adding more services at night and raising
awareness  among  station  employees,  drivers  and
passen gers.183

Environ mental design plays an important role in
reducing crime in public transport. In the US, the
Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority184
and the New York Port Authority Bus Terminal are
classic examples of success stories of applied security
design against crime in rail trans port environ ments.185
In each case, environ mental design shares the credit
for increased security with strategic policing, strict
maintenance procedures and ‘zero tolerance’ policies
in enforcing rules and regulations. Another example
of crime prevention through environ mental design
is evident in the UK, where closed circuit television
cameras are used widely to monitor public spaces
such as shopping malls, car parks and a few residential

The emergence of low-cost open-source mapping
tools; widespread cellular network coverage in devel -
op ing  countries;  declining  costs  of  mobile  phone
hardware;  and  increasing  internet  use  by  public
agencies have resulted in unprecedented oppor tun -
ities  to  support  trans port  planning  and  manage-
ment in devel op ing countries.187 Some three-quarters
of  the  world’s  inhabitants  now  have  access  to  a
mobile phone. The number of mobile subscriptions
grew from fewer than 1 billion in 2000 to over 6
billion in 2012; nearly 5 billion of these are in devel -
op ing countries. In 2011 alone, more than 30 billion

Advances  in  technology  now  make  it  possible 
to  respond  to  speciﬁc  needs,  including  those  of
particularly  vulnerable  groups  such  as  women,
persons with limited mobility and persons with dis -
abilities.  This  could  mean  beneﬁting  from  new
opportunities  through  safer  and  easier  trans port
access. In Egypt, an innovative website ‘HarassMap’
was launched in December 2010 to help report and
map cases of harassment.189 Due to the affordable
and adaptable technology, victims of harassment are
able  to  anonymously  report  incidents  by  simply
sending an SMS message to this website.

Another innovation is the ‘Access Advisr’, a pilot
web application in the UK that uses crowd-sourcing
to identify local people’s needs in order to improve
accessibility to the existing public trans port network
for  disabled  and  older  persons.190 The  application
identiﬁes problem areas for accessible transport, and
allows the review of information about the physical
infra struc ture, and to rate it – through a live feed-
back community of users who can contribute their
views, photos and videos based on their own experi -
ences.

CONCLUDING REMARKS
AND LESSONS FOR POLICY
Mobility is required to ensure access to basic goods,
services and activities, and in that sense it is essen-
tial to social equity. Restrictions on such access may
imply an abuse of human rights. In order to ensure
equitable  access,  cities  need  to  understand  the 
trans port needs of all urban dwellers, distinguishing
between the priorities of men and women, the young
and  old,  the  able  and  the  disabled.  There  is  thus 
a  need  to  understand  the  purposes  and  uses  that
would  be  derived  from  improved  access,  and  the
constraints  preventing  those  needs  from  being
fulﬁlled. While social objectives are often acknow -
ledged  in  trans port  strategies,  experi ences  show 
that very little practice goes beyond pilot schemes
and case studies. Yet, the importance of the social
sus tain ability  of  urban  trans port cannot  be  under -
estimated; it is a key prerequisite for social devel op -
ment.

In  theory,  there  are  already  both  awareness 
and some knowledge of the role that mobility plays
in terms of improving – or worsening – a person’s
quality of life. However, the complex dynamics are
often not well understood. This leads to a situation
whereby  those  responsible  for  taking  action  fall 
back on traditional solutions; namely: infra struc ture
devel op ment, improvement of conditions for private
transport,  and  lump-sum  payments  or  untargeted

subsidies. Trans port subsidy is an important policy
option for ensuring equitable trans port access. How -
ever, it is essential that such subsidies are designed
carefully to target the poor and other vulnerable and
dis advan taged groups.

Good  mobility  policies  should  contribute  to
poverty reduction by recognizing both the necessity
of improved macroeconomic efﬁciency, and the need
for direct targeting of trans port interventions. There
has been a tendency to treat these two dimensions
of trans port policy separately, with the result that an
effective and uniﬁed approach to urban mobility has
been  lacking.  One  way  of  dealing  with  this  is  by
ensuring that poverty reduction becomes an explicit
objective of trans port policies, with clear strategies
to bring the beneﬁts of economic efﬁciency to poor
people, through redistribution and direct targeting
programmes,  including  preferential  treatment  of
speciﬁc vulnerable and dis advan taged groups.

In order to minimize poor accessibility, appro -
priate urban planning and land use is essential. As a
derived demand, trans port infra struc ture that enables
access  to  low-cost  trans port  can  make  a  crucial
contribution to poverty reduction. However, large-
scale trans port infra struc ture projects tend to beneﬁt
high-income groups the most. The poor and other
low-income groups are often displaced to make way
for the projects, and may derive little or no beneﬁt.
Accessibility planning is viewed as a mechanism
for ensuring equity and reducing mobility. Devel op -
ing services and facilities on a localized basis that
places trans port within easy and affordable reach of
the poor, forms a central principle within a sus tain -
able urban  mobility  paradigm.  Greater  attention
should be given to investments in bus-priority and
non-motorized trans port facilities, in order to reduce
the negative impacts of congestion. In some devel -
oped countries, it may even be possible to learn from
the experi ence of some devel op ing countries, where
the  urban  poor  are  supported  by  the  existence  of
cheap  (mostly  informal)  trans port  solutions.  Many
low-cost actions can be implemented, which focus
on both walking and cycling facilities, especially in
poorly  equipped  areas.  Such  interventions  could
contribute to the welfare of the urban poor, as well
as  the  economic  activities  of  petty  traders  and
hawkers.

While great strides have been made in devel op -
ing  gender-appropriate  trans port  policies  and
universal design solutions, consistent implementation
is still lacking. Moving towards greater equity in urban
mobility is an essential prerequisite for achieving sus -
tain able urban mobility systems. Concerted efforts
must be made by decision-makers to establish mobil -
ity systems that address the needs of all population
groups, especially the poor, the young, the elderly
and the disabled.

The  mere  existence  of  gender-main streaming
materials and ofﬁcial (international or national) policy

Equitable Access to Urban Mobility

documents  alone  does  not  mean  that  gender  is
successfully  integrated  in  the  trans port  sector.
Particular attention needs to be paid to gender issues,
and  consideration  given  to  the  differential  needs 
and demands arising from varying gender contexts.
Similarly,  it  is  increasingly  being  recognized  that
there is a need for an analysis of gender that acknow -
ledges income differences, in order to assess how
individuals experi ence urban mobility. Accordingly,
it  is  crucial  that  women  are  represented  in  the
planning, design and decision-making of all trans port
investments (including user panels).

As noted earlier in this report, urban mobility
is primarily a means to an end: to provide access to
basic  goods,  services  and  activities.  In  this  con-
text,  the  core  social  requirement  for  an  urban
mobility system is that it delivers its services equally
to  different  localities,  interest  groups  and  across
generations. Similarly, the negative impacts should
be  distributed  fairly  among  all  users.  Granting

equitable access for all will involve devel op ing and
implementing  appropriate  measures  and  control
mechanisms, which include the following:

• Fare and pricing policies;
• Flexible routing and servicing;
• Establishing  schedules  that  are  considerate  of

people’s activity patterns and time budgets;

• Acknowledging  the  importance  of  the  services
provided  by  the  informal  sector  and  by  non-
motorized transport;

• Introducing innovative trans port services that also
make use of opportunities provided by information
and communication technologies;

• Addressing the safety and security concerns and

other needs of trans port users;

• Eliminating gender biases by integrating the trans -
port needs of women into trans port policy and
planning processes.

URBAN MOBILITY AND 
THE ENVIRON MENT

The increasing mobility experi enced in cities all over
the world brings enormous beneﬁts to society and
also provides the essential means by which a city can
function effectively. The increasing urban mobility
is manifested in three major forms: an increase in
the number of trips made, an increase in the length
of each trip, and – last but not least – an increasing
motorization of urban people and goods movement.
The environ mental consequences of the increased
motorization – and in particular the use of private
motorized  vehicles  (cars  and  motorcycles)  –  are
cause for major concerns, not only locally in the city,
but also globally, as the trans port sector is one of
the major contributors to greenhouse gas emissions,
the major cause of climate change.

In the past, it has often been argued that trans -
port is an essential prerequisite for economic growth,
at least for cities at an early stage in their devel op -
ment. It has also been argued that this relationship
is not so important for cities in developed countries
where  there  is  already  an  extensive  network  of
routes and where levels of accessibility are already
high.1 Recent  debates  have  argued  for  prosperity
without  growth,2 meaning  that  economic  growth
(and transport) needs to be more closely aligned with
environ mental and social priorities.

It is increasingly being acknowledged that urban
devel op ment has to be based not only on economic
growth, but also on social equity (and equal access)
and environ mental sus tain ability. Thus interventions
in urban mobility systems should not only address
the economic beneﬁts of higher levels of accessibility
(and mobility), but at the same time take account of
the social and environ mental implications of following
particular policy pathways.3

The purpose of this chapter is to highlight envir -
on mental sus tain ability  concerns  within  urban
mobility systems. This includes the identiﬁcation of
environ mental costs and a discussion of the means
by which their impacts can be reduced. The chapter
acknowledges  that  urban  mobility  will  always  use
resources and generate externalities,4 but its impact

on  the  urban  environ ment  can  be  substantially
reduced, so that it remains within acceptable limits
and makes a strong contribution to other aspects of
sus tain ability, including intergenerational concerns.
The  ﬁrst  section  of  the  chapter  identiﬁes  the
main environ mental challenges facing urban mobility,
focusing on oil dependence, greenhouse gas emiss -
ions,  sprawl  and  human  health  concerns.  This  is
followed  by  ﬁve  sections  that  discuss  the  policy
responses to these challenges. The second to fourth
sections focus on reducing the number of trips made,
reducing travel distances in cities and changing the
modal  split  towards  non-motorized  and  public
transport. The ﬁfth section discusses the potential
of technology in reducing the negative externalities
of motorization by addressing the efﬁciency and age
of  the  vehicle  stock,  standards  of  fuels  used  and
emissions from vehicles and alternatives to oil-based
fuels, and the need for increased efﬁciency in the
use  of  vehicles.  The  sixth  section  argues  that,  in
practical terms, a combination of several approaches
is likely to be most effective. This is followed by a
section that (brieﬂy) discusses international funding
mechanisms to achieve environ mentally sus tain able
urban mobility systems. The ﬁnal section contains a
brief summary and some major lessons for policy.

ENVIRON MENTAL
CHALLENGES IN URBAN
MOBILITY SYSTEMS
Environ mental concerns  have,  over  the  last  few
decades, become central to the debates about sus -
tain  able urban  mobility.  Yet,  in  practice,  devel op -
mental  objectives  seem  to  take  priority  over
envir on mental concerns. A key message underpinning
the discussion in this chapter is the need to ﬁnd the
means  by  which  both  devel op mental  and  environ -
mental concerns can be addressed at the same time,
in mutually supporting ways.

Motorized urban
transport relies
almost entirely
(95 per cent) on
oil-based products
for its energy
supply

The transport
sector accounts
for about 22 per
cent of global
energy use

Planning and Design for Sustainable Urban Mobility

Motorized urban trans port relies almost entirely
(95  per  cent)  on  oil-based  products  for  its  energy
supply, primarily in the form of petrol and diesel.5
The  shift  in  urban  trans port technology  toward
motorization has thus led to a signiﬁcant increase in
the global consumption of such oil-based products.
While 45.4 per cent of global oil supplies were used
in  the  trans port  sector  in  1973,  this  ﬁgure  had
increased to 61.5 per cent in 2010. Thus, while the
total amount of oil used globally increased by 63 per
cent during the 1973–2010 period, the consumption
by the trans port sector increased by 120 per cent.6
It has been estimated that the trans port sector
accounts for about 22 per cent of global energy use.
The bulk of this (about two-thirds) is accounted for
by passen ger transport, while the rest is consumed
by freight transport. As can be seen from Table 7.1,
cars and motorcycles (the bulk of which is private
motorized transport) account for nearly half of the
energy consumption of the entire trans port sector.
The dependence on an oil-based energy supply
means that there has been a direct correspondence
between the amount of energy used in the trans port
sector and the emissions of CO2, the main transport-
related  greenhouse  gas.  CO2 emissions  from  the
trans port sector have remained constant at about 23
per cent of total energy-related CO2 emissions during
the  1973–2009  period.7 Given  the  considerable
growth  in  urban  travel  demand  globally  (as  the
world’s urban population is projected to increase by
40 per cent between 2010 and 2030),8 mitigation
technologies and practices are urgently required to
achieve a signiﬁcant global reduction in carbon-based
energy use for urban transport.

There are, however, a number of other signiﬁ -
cant impacts of oil-based trans port energy on both
the natural environ ment and the built environ ment.
This section focuses on these impacts and related
environ mental challenges. The environ mental con -
di tions  of  cities  vary  signiﬁcantly  –  both  between 
and within cities. Yet, many of the problems arising
from the trans port sector affect all urban residents

(although,  in  many  cities,  the  poor  suffer  dispro -
portionally from many of the negative externalities
of urban transportation) and impacts upon health and
the  quality  of  life  in  cities  in  general.  Four  major
clusters of challenges are discussed below, namely:
motorization  and  oil  dependence;  mobility  and
climate change; dependence on motorized forms of
trans port  and  urban  sprawl;  and  human  health
concerns.

Motorization and oil dependence
Despite  the  many  negative  impacts  arising  from
depen d ence  on  oil-based  energy  products  in  the
trans port  sector,  the  sector  is  likely  to  remain  a
premium  user  of  such  products.  There  are  many
reasons for this, the most prominent of which are
listed below:

• Oil-based products have the highest energy density
of all fuels.9 Thus, any change to alternative fuels
(e.g. biofuels, solar, hydrogen or electricity) needs
to  be  examined  with  caution  in  light  of  the
quantity  of  such  alternative  fuels  required  to
travel a given distance.

• There  are  currently  no  substitutes  to  oil-based
products  that  are  available  in  the  quantities
required.

• Considerable investments have already been made
in the infra struc ture supporting oil-based trans -
portation (i.e. fuel stations and oil reﬁneries).10

However,  global  supplies  of  oil  are  not  unlimited, 
and they are often subject to political interference.
The  politically  induced  oil  shortages  of  the  1970s 
and the rapid price increases during the last decade
(Figure 7.1) have exempliﬁed the potential conse -
quences of reductions in oil supply, as a component
of  national  energy  security.11 The  urban  poor  in
devel op ing  countries  are  especially  hit  hard  by
increased petrol prices. In 2011, Kenya experi enced
a  shortage  in  petrol  supply,  followed  by  a  rise  of

Year

30 per cent in petrol prices within a few months.12
Car owners slowly decreased their number of trips;
however  the  mounting  prices  had  an  immediate
effect on public transport. Privately owned bus lines
initially decreased the frequency of legs collecting
passen gers  to  maintain  proﬁtability,  followed  by 
the  suspension  of  multiple  public  trans port lines 
by owners, while at the same time demanding the
govern ment  lower  petrol  prices.  As  a  result,  the
urban poor living at the fringes of the city suffered
the most, unable to travel long distances to earn a
living.

In  the  short  term,  the  trans port  sector  is
prepared to pay for the higher costs of energy, and
most  savings  in  the  use  of  carbon-based  energy
sources  will  come  from  the  use  of  more  efﬁcient
technology within the conventional petrol and diesel
vehicles. In the longer term, however, and irrespec -
tive of the wider environ mental impacts, the trans -
port sector needs to diversify its sources of energy
and to de-carbonize the sources of fuel used.13

High and volatile prices have encouraged some
countries to subsidize fuel prices to protect their own
motorists from increasing world prices for petrol and

diesel. Other countries impose various taxes on such
commodities. Thus, the pump price for petrol varies
considerably  between  (and  also  within)  countries,
from  US$0.02  per  litre  in  Venezuela  to  US$2.54 
in  Eritrea  (Figure  7.2).  The  political  rationale  for
subsidizing fuel prices varies dramatically from one
country to another.14 However, the perverse effect
of  fuel  subsidies  has  been  to  encourage  more  car
travel.  And,  it  can  be  argued  that  fuel  subsidies 
pri marily  beneﬁt  car  owners.  Targeted  subsidies 
to  public  trans port are  a  better  alternative  if  the
objective is to make trans port more affordable to the
urban  poor.  In  general,  fuel  prices  should  not  be
subsidized for the sake of short-term political interest
(Box 7.1), as it is important that the full environ mental
costs of fuels are paid by the user. This is known in
international law as the ‘polluter pays principle’.15
It has been estimated that ‘a universal phase-out of
all fossil-fuel consumption subsidies by 2020 would
cut  global  primary  energy  demand  by  5%’,  with
savings  predominantly  in  the  trans port  sector.16 If 
fuel subsidies are to be retained, it is often argued
that it would be better to subsidize renewable energy
sources, to encourage a shift away from fossil fuels.17

Planning and Design for Sustainable Urban Mobility

Box 7.1 Fuel subsidies

With high oil prices (over US$100 a barrel), many countries
are not passing on these costs to users, as fossil fuels are
needed for cooking, heating, electricity generation as well 
as powering engines and vehicles. The International Monetary
Fund estimates the global bill for fuel subsidies reached
US$250 billion in 2010, up from US$60 billion in 2003.a
Some 40 per cent of this amount are subsidies for oil 
products (the rest being natural gas, electricity and coal).b
Other sources quote even higher levels of fossil fuel 
subsidies, namely: ‘$523 billion in 2011, up almost 30% on
2010 and six times more than subsidies to renewables’.c

For oil-producing countries fuel subsidies are part of a
social contract and can be managed. In Iran alone, the total
value of oil subsides reached nearly US$25 billion in 2005.b
But for non-oil producers it creates an additional ﬁscal burden
and it means that investments in other sectors are delayed as
foreign currency is used to pay for the oil. In India, it is
estimated that fuel subsidies have added US$20 billion, or 
1 per cent of GDP, to the national budget.a

Most of those that argue for the continuation of

subsidies on fossil fuels argue that this is done to assist the
poor. In practice, however, this is rarely the case; as ‘only 8%
of the subsidies to fossil-fuel consumption in 2010 reached the
poorest 20% of the population’.d The ﬁgure is even lower for
petrol and diesel, where only 6 per cent of the total subsidy
went to the poorest 20 per cent of the population.e

For political reasons, ‘Govern ments like to keep

subsidies “off-budget” since “on-budget” subsidies are an easy
target for pressure groups interested in reducing the overall
tax burden. For this reason, subsidies often take the form of
price controls that set prices below full cost, especially where
the energy company is state-owned, or of a requirement on
energy buyers to take minimum volumes from a speciﬁc,
usually domestic, supply source. Subsidies may be aimed at
producers, such as a grant paid for each unit of production, or
at consumers, such as a rebate or exemption on the normal
sales tax’.f
Sources: a Hook et al, 2011; b IEA, 2006, Figure 11.7; c IEA, 2012a, p1; d IEA, 2011c, p7; 
e IEA, 2011d; f UNEP, 2008, p9.

Cities  make  greater  efﬁciency  in  their  use  of
energy  for  trans port  than  less  densely  populated
locations,  as  more  efﬁcient  public  trans port can
replace the need to use a private car, and as distances
are  shorter.  The  relative  energy  efﬁciencies  for
different modes of trans port in 84 cities are shown
in Table 7.2. The occupancy rates for public trans -
port vehicles are central to the interpretation of this
table. The substantial differences in energy efﬁciency
between cities in the different regions are partly due
to  the  technology  being  used,  but  also  to  the
occupancy levels. For example, China has high levels

of efﬁciencies for all forms of public trans port (except
ferry), while the ﬁgures for the US are signiﬁcantly
lower. The general conclusion of the table, however,
is  that  there  is  a  signiﬁcant  potential  to  reduce
energy use (and thus greenhouse gas emissions) by
encouraging more people to use public transport.

1970s and 1980s, the United Nations Framework

Climate Convention, entered into force in 1994. Its
ultimate objective is to stabilize global greenhouse
gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that
will  prevent  human  interference  with  the  climate
system.  In  order  to  achieve  this,  many  developed
countries  committed  (through  the  Kyoto  Protocol) 
to reduce their overall greenhouse gas emissions by
at  least  5  per  cent  below  1990  levels  by  2012.18
Although  some  countries  have  managed  to  meet
their commitments, many other countries (primarily
those that did not commit to reductions) have in -
creased their greenhouse gas emissions dramatically.
Global emissions of CO2 have increased by nearly 50
per cent between 1990 (20.97 billion tonnes)19 and
2010 (30.6 billion tonnes).20

Globally, the CO2 emissions from the trans port
sector  have  increased  by  85  per  cent  from  3.593
billion  tonnes  in  1973  to  6.665  billion  tonnes  in
2007.21 With  respect  to  the  targets  of  the  Kyoto
Protocol, the emissions have increased by over 47
per cent during the 1990–2007 period.22

There is considerable variation in the amounts
of CO2 produced by different countries and regions.
A similar variation applies to the emissions from the
trans port sector. As can be seen from Table 7.3, the
trans port emissions per capita in North America are
more than four times the global average, and more
than double that in other OECD countries. The CO2
emissions  from  transportation  are  much  lower  in
devel op ing countries. The emissions in most of Asia
and Africa are about a third or a quarter of the global
average, the notable exception is the Middle East,
where  the  transportation  emissions  per  capita  are
similar to those in Europe. Even more striking: while
the overall CO2 emissions per capita in the US are
some  2.5  times  higher  than  in  China,  the  CO2
emissions per capita from transportation in the US
are 12 times as high as in China.

As  indicated  in  Table  7.1,  road  and  maritime
freight accounts for about 25 per cent and 10.6 per

cent  of  the  CO2 emissions,  respectively.  Aviation
accounts  for  another  12.4  per  cent,  while  the
emissions from rail trans port are insigniﬁcant. The
remaining 52 per cent of CO2 emissions are being
produced  from  passen ger  road  transport.23 For  all
parts of the world, more energy (and CO2 emissions)
per capita is used in private than in public transport;
in Africa the ratio is 3:1, while it is 50:1 in the US.24
At the city level, there is considerable variation
in energy use between cities. For example, more than
half the total energy consumption in Mexico City and
Cape Town is trans port based,25 while the levels in
many  European  cities  (for  example,  London  and
Paris) are about a quarter.26 This reﬂects the differ -
ences between cities in terms of their structure, their
urban form, their densities, their levels of sprawl, the
importance  of  public  trans port and  the  balance
between energy use in trans port and other sectors.
Figure 7.3 shows variations in CO2 emissions
from  passen ger  trans port across  cities  in  various
parts of the world. The emissions are highest in US,
followed  by  Canadian  and  Australian  cities,  with
emissions in the range of 2–7.5 tonnes per capita.
Most European cities have emissions in the range of
1–2  tonnes  per  capita.  Most  devel op ing  country
cities, however, have signiﬁcantly lower emissions.
To provide a speciﬁc example: the mobility patterns
of each resident of Atlanta, US, produce about 150
times as much CO2 emissions as those of a resident
of Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam. Figure 7.3 also shows
that, in most cities, the emissions from public trans -
port are insigniﬁcant compared to those from private
motorized transport.

Nearly one-half of the world’s cities are located
on the coast or along major rivers. These locations
have in the past been subject to occasional ﬂooding,
but these risks have increased as a result of more
frequent storm surges and high winds, accentuated
by global warming and sea-level rise. The vulnerability
of these cities to ﬂooding has thus been substantially

There is . . . an
immediate need
for cities to take
action to protect
the existing
transport
infrastructure
from the impacts
of climate change

For [the poorest
and most
vulnerable]
groups, urban
sprawl often leads
to social isolation

increased, and some have taken action to reduce the
potential impacts. However, some 40 million people
are still exposed to a 1 in 100 year coastal ﬂood event,
and this will rise to 150 million in 2070.27 A recent
survey  of  90  cities  indicates  that  severe  ﬂooding 
and storm-water management is among the top three
challenges facing cities.28 Trans port is central to the
functioning  of  cities,  and  it  is  often  the  trans port
system that is initially affected by ﬂooding and high
temperatures. Yet, it is that same trans port system
that is required to provide access to the locations that
have become isolated as a result of ﬂooding. Further -
more,  when  urban  trans port infra struc ture  fails 
this can have far-reaching economic consequences,
as people cannot get to work and goods cannot be
distributed.29

There is thus an immediate need for cities to
take action to protect the existing trans port infra -
struc ture from the impacts of climate change. This
includes  continuous  maintenance,  but  may  also
require additional investments in drainage, erosion
control and protective engineering structures. At the
same time, cities all over the world should integrate
planning  for  climate  change  with  general  land-use
planning  to  reduce  vulnerability  for  new  devel op -
ments. This should include limitations on devel op -
ments  in  ﬂood-prone  locations.  The  infra struc ture
itself can be designed to be more resilient to high
temperatures (e.g. buckling of rail, effects on metallic
bridges, etc.), and should be raised above the levels
of  the  surrounding  countryside  to  allow  passage
during  ﬂooding.  Further more,  drainage  systems
should  be  designed  with  a  capacity  to  move  ﬂood
waters  away  from  the  infra struc ture.30 Moreover,
improvements to existing, or devel op ment of new,
trans port  infra struc ture  should  take  into  account

the  requirements  of  the  whole  urban  population,
including vulnerable and dis advan taged groups (see
Chapter 6).31

Dependence on motorized forms of
trans port and urban sprawl
Increasing levels of motorization have, in most cities,
resulted  in  lower  densities  and  decentralization,
with the second-round effect that suburban living has
generally encouraged the ownership of a car. Motor -
ization also exacerbates congestion, which can have
the  knock-on  effect  of  increasing  travel  times  on
public transport, thus further encouraging travel by
private cars. While, in many cities, buses tend to be
unreliable (due partly to congestion),32 the car seems
to offer more control as alternative less congested
routes can be used, giving the driver greater ﬂexi -
bility. For those with access to a car, mobility levels
increase and many also want to live in lower density
devel op ments. This gives rise to urban sprawl. This
in turn makes it difﬁcult to provide alternatives to
the car.33 Such devel op ment has been common in
locations where land is available and cheap.34

However, not everyone can afford a private car,
leading  (in  many  cities)  to  a  social  stratiﬁcation 
of urban trans port systems. The poorest and most
vulnerable groups (including women, children, youth,
elderly and disabled persons) cannot afford to (or are
unable to use) private cars.35 For these groups, urban
sprawl often leads to social isolation.36

In  addition  to  more  space  being  taken  up  by 
low-density  devel op ments,  trans port  systems  in 
such  settlements  also  use  substantial  amounts  of
space  for  roads,  railways,  car  parks  and  other
associated  infra struc ture.  The  loss  of  agricultural

Urban Mobility and the Environment

land and the changing local climate resulting from
greater  amounts  of  land  being  allocated  to  urban
devel op ment  (and  motorized  transport)  mean  that
there  may  be  increased  fragmentation  of  natural
habitats, reductions in biodiversity and impacts on
local  ecosystems  as  roads  act  as  barriers.37 An
Australian study found that energy use in suburban
households was 50 per cent higher than those in the
urban  centre,  and  this  was  explained  primarily  by
greater car use and longer journeys.38 Other coun-
tries  (for  example,  China)  now  have  the  problem 
of loss of productive land as cities spread and as car
ownership  levels  increase.  In  Hyderabad  (India),
which  more  than  doubled  its  population  between
1980 and 1999,39 the urban land take increased from
9 per cent to 24 per cent of the total land available
(1980–1999). This resulted in a 24 per cent reduc -
tion of the agricultural land area.40

Human health concerns
The  increased  motorization  of  urban  trans port is 
also causing serious challenges to human health. This
section  summarizes  the  main  physical  health  con -
cerns  related  to  air  and  noise  pollution,  reduced

physical  activity,  as  well  as  issues  related  to  com -
munity severance, open spaces and mental health.
Road trafﬁc accidents, which are perhaps the most
prominent  human  health  concern  from  urban
mobility, are discussed in Chapter 6, as part of the
discussion on urban safety and security.

n Air pollution
The impacts of air pollution on air quality and human
health are gaining increasing attention by residents
and  local  govern ments  alike.41 Worldwide,  it  has
been estimated that ‘a record 3.2 million people died
from air pollution in 2010, compared with 800,000
in  2000’.42 The  impacts  of  transport-related  air 
pol lution  affect  all  urban  residents,  but  there  is 
sub stantial  evidence  that  it  affects  the  poor  and
vulnerable groups more than others. In fact, the social
groups that are most seriously impacted are often not
those that cause the pollution.43 The main groups of
local air pollutants – nitrogen oxides, volatile organic
com pounds, carbon monoxide and particulate matter 
(as well as some other pollutants) – are described in
Box 7.2.

Trucks  and  other  freight  carriers  emit  dis -
proportionate amounts of pollutants in cities. Even

An Australian
study found that
energy use in
suburban
households was
50 per cent higher
than those in the
urban centre, and
this was explained
primarily by
greater car use
and longer
journeys

Box 7.2 Air pollutants

Nitrogen oxides (NOx) when combined with other air
pollutants can lead to respiratory difﬁculties and reduced lung
functions, particularly in urban areas (where densities lead to
higher concentrations). In the 32 member countries of the
European Environ ment Agency, trans port emissions of NOx
have reduced by 32 per cent (1990–2008) through the
introduction of catalytic converters, but this reduction has
been offset by some growth in trafﬁc.a In many devel op ing
countries the add-on technology is not mandatory and trafﬁc
has been growing at a rapid rate.

Volatile organic compounds comprise a wide variety of
hydrocarbons and other substances (e.g. methane and
ethylene) that result from the incomplete combustion of fossil
fuels. When combined with NOx in heat and sunlight,
hydrocarbons and volatile organic compounds generate low-
level ozone, a main contributor to photochemical smog. Their
impact has a measurable effect on respiratory functions and as
an irritation, but these levels are declining as technologies
improve.b

Carbon monoxide (CO) is an odourless and almost
colourless gas, which is very toxic as it interferes with the
absorption of oxygen. This in turn can lead to increased
morbidity and can affect fertility and general levels of health.
The trans port sector is a major contributor as carbon
monoxide comes principally from the incomplete combustion
of fuel.b

Particulate matter consists of very small particles (under 10
microns in diameter: PM10), that come mainly from diesel fuels,

tyre particles and road dust. They can cause cancer, worsen
heart and breathing problems for sensitive groups and may
lead to premature mortality for all urban residents. 
Among 59 cities in Asia, Africa and Latin America, only two
meet standards for PM10, while 46 of the cities exceeded the
standard by more than twice (WHO standard is 90 milligram
per cubic metre).c Cities in devel op ing countries are most at
risk, partly due to minimal enforcement. In Beijing, China, the
govern ment shut down ‘103 heavily polluting factories and
took 30% of govern ment vehicles off roads to combat
dangerously high air pollution . . . but the . . . air remained
hazardous despite the measures’ in January 2013. The reason
was that the amount of PM2.5 (particles with a diameter of less
than 2.5 microns) reached more than 500 milligram per cubic
metre, on a scale where 300 is considered hazardous, while
the WHO recommends a daily level of no more than 20.d
Similar high levels have also been reported in other Asian
cities, such as New Delhi, India.e

Other pollutants – such as lead (Pb), ammonia (NH3) and
sulphur dioxide (SO2) – have trans port links but are less
important than the four listed above, as they are being
reduced through the switch to different and ‘cleaner’ fuels and
new designs for catalytic converters. However, many cities still
allow the use of leaded petrol, despite the known dangers for
children and their mental devel op ment.

though they make up less than 10 per cent of road
trafﬁc  in  most  European  cities,  large  commercial
vehicles can cause half of all nitrogen dioxide emis -
sions, about a third of particulate matter, and more
than 20 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions.44

n Noise pollution
Noise and vibration are often cited as nuisances to
people living in urban areas, but it is often the peak
or unexpected noises that are most problematical.
In developed countries, about 130 million people are
exposed to unacceptable noise levels over 65dB(A),
and  400  million  to  inconvenient  levels  of  over
55dB(A).45 In  some  ‘quiet’  countries  (parts  of
Scandinavia) only 5 per cent of residents are exposed,
while up to 30 per cent of residents in ‘noisy’ cities
can be exposed.46 Prolonged exposure to noise can
lead to anxiety, depression and insomnia.47 Vibration
is caused by all vehicles, but it is heavy trucks that
cause  most  intrusion  and  this  again  affects  sleep,
increasing levels of stress and anxiety.48 Noises from
horns are common in many cities, and car alarms also
cause  nuisance  to  residents.  In  Moscow,  around
three-quarters of the population live in areas with
levels  of  trans port  noise  that  exceed  WHO
standards.49

n Human health and physical activity
There are also major health effects resulting from the
lack of physical activity that accompanies increased
motorization. The perceived danger of walking and
cycling  is  a  strong  disincentive  to  non-motorized
transport.50 As  more  people  travel  by  motorized
transport, the risks to vulnerable road users increase,
and, as a result, fewer people walk and cycle. There
is growing evidence of the links between physical
inactivity and weight, and of the impacts that these
two factors have on the risk of diabetes, heart disease,
colon  cancer,  strokes  and  breast  cancer.51 Food-
energy  intake  has  not  decreased  in  line  with
reductions in physical activity, and many countries
are experiencing an epidemic in obesity.52

According to the Global Burden of Disease Study,
overweight  and  obesity  accounts  for  36  million
disability  adjusted  life  years  (DALYs)  lost,  with
physical inactivity accounting for a further 32 million
DALYs.53 In the UK, about 66 per cent of adults do
not  get  enough  exercise,  and  the  majority  of  the
population is now overweight or obese.54 The links
between health and non-motorized trans port need
to be emphasized through education programmes and
the involvement of doctors. Copenhagen, Denmark,
is often cited as a good example of a cycling city as
there  are  numerous  initiatives,  both  private  and
public, to promote cycling.55

In  a  study  of  30,000  people  over  a  14  year
period, it was found that cycling to work reduced
the risk of mortality at a given age by 39 per cent
relative to those that did not cycle, and over half of

cyclists (54 per cent) cite speed and convenience as
their  main  reason  for  cycling,  meaning  that  their
journey times were reduced.56

n Community severance, open spaces and

mental health

Community severance divides and fragments com -
munities,  and  is  often  a  result  of  heavily  used 
trans port  infra struc ture  forming  a  barrier  so  that
people cannot cross the road or rail track. It adversely
affects the quality of life, the level of activities on
the street and the amount of social interaction within
communities. It is particularly important for young
people who are trying to socialize, and who often
come  to  the  understanding  that  the  urban  space
surrounding  them  belongs  to  motorized  vehicles
rather than people.57

The reallocation of space from people to cars
means that roads are widened and the space available
for non-motorized modes is reduced. Further more,
the expansion of roads often competes with open and
green spaces (as well as squares and other spaces that
allow people to spend time together). These spaces
are important for the quality of life, and for their role
in providing the ‘lungs’ of the city. Much of these
spaces are open to the public and can be used for
recreational  and  sporting  activities,  as  well  as
providing  habitat  for  wildlife  and  for  absorbing
carbon.58

There  is  also  evidence  that  trafﬁc  congestion 
can impair ‘health, psychological adjustment, work
performance  and  overall  satisfaction  with  life’.59
Research  indicates  that  job  satisfaction  and  com -
mitment  declines  with  increased  road  commuting 
dis tance (but not with public transit use), and that
perceived trafﬁc stress is associated with both lower
general health status and depression.60 According to
the 2011 IBM commuter pain survey, 42 per cent
of respondents stated that their stress levels (due to
congestion) had increased and 35 per cent reported
increased anger.61 Additional environ mental effects
of trafﬁc congestion include pedestrian/vehicle con -
ﬂicts  on  congested  streets,  which  cause  safety
concerns and trafﬁc delays, visual intrusion caused
by elevated roads, bus stations, etc., and distorted
city  image,  which  disturbs  liveability  and  reduces
tourism potential.62

REDUCING THE NUMBER 
OF MOTORIZED TRIPS
There are many opportunities to reduce the need to
travel by motorized transport. One is to travel by non-
motorized means instead (i.e. walking or cycling).63
Cycling can be encouraged for many shorter trips (i.e.
normally less than 10 kilometres), provided that the
infra struc ture is available, including space to securely

Box 7.3 A successful bicycle sharing system, Changwon, the Republic of Korea

The city of Changwon is working towards becoming Korea’s
leading ‘eco-rich city’, by improving the quality of life through
sus tain able mobility and non-motorized transportation. As a
part of this effort, the ‘Nubija’ bicycle sharing system was
introduced on 22 October 2008, with 20 parking stations
(where bikes can be checked out and returned) and a total of
430 bicycles.

The system has since increased steadily, and by 2011

there were 163 parking stations (with 3300 bicycles). At that
time, the membership of the scheme had reached 76,579, 

who ride an average of 4396 kilometres per day. By early 2012 
it was reported that the number of parking stations had
reached 230.

The bicycle sharing system has led to annual emissions
reduction of more than 4000 tonnes of CO2 by 2011. Other
outcomes have been reduced energy consumption, lower
levels of air pollution and better public health.

leave the bicycle. More imaginative innovations are
the cycle hire schemes that are now a feature of many
cities (see for example Box 7.3), where old technology
(the  bicycle)  has  been  matched  up  with  the  new
technology (smartcards), so that bikes can be used
on demand, either free for an initial period or for a
reasonable charge. Another good example is that of
Paris, France, which has introduced a popular bike
sharing scheme (vélib) and aims to increase the city’s
network  of  bike  lanes  to  some  700  kilometres  by
2014.64 The  co-beneﬁts  are  manifest  for  the  user
(healthy and fast) and for the trans port system (less
space is used). However, it should be noted that the
potential for increased bicycle use is related to age
and  (dis)ability,  as  well  as  prevalent  cultural
constraints, that may, for example, limit the use of
bicycles by women.

Unfortunately,  in  many  cities  of  devel op ing
countries the promotion of cycling as an alternative
to motorized travel is fraught with danger, due to
lack of dedicated bicycle lanes, forcing riders into 
a  rather  uneven  competition  for  road  space  with
motorized vehicles. There are some positive devel -
op ments though. The City of Buenos Aires, Argentina,
for example has since 2010 developed a 94-kilometre
network of protected bike lanes, and introduced a
bike-share  programme  featuring  more  than  22
stations  and  over  850  bikes.  The  City  intends  to
expand its bike lane network to 130 kilometres by
2013.65 Similarly, the two Egyptian cities of Fayoum
and  Shebin  El  Kom  are  planning  the  construction 
of  14  kilometres  of  cycling  tracks  and  improved
sidewalks on major streets.66

Another means to reduce the number of trips
is through trip-chaining, where several activities are
undertaken on one tour (from home back to home)
rather than as a series of several individual trips. This
again reduces overall distance travelled, but needs
to  be  matched  by  the  location  of  destinations  in 
close  proximity  to  each  other  and  by  mixed-land
uses.67

The most effective way of reducing the number
of trips (at least in theory) is that a speciﬁc trip is no
longer made as it has been replaced by a non-travel

activity  or  substituted  through  technology,  for
example internet shopping (Box 7.4). For many years
now there have been debates over the potential for
teleworking,  teleactivities  and  teleconferencing,68
and the more recent advent of mobile technology has
opened up many new possibilities.69 Although there
is  a  large  substitution  potential,  the  relationships
seem to be symbiotic with a greater opportunity for
ﬂexibility  in  travel  patterns,  as  some  activities  are
substituted, while others are generated, and some
replaced by fewer longer distance journeys.70

The  introduction  of  new  technology  has  ex -
tended to mobile phones, and these have become
available  worldwide,  often  changing  lives  through
allowing social and business communications. It is
unclear  about  the  implications  for  travel,  but  the
effects are likely to be positive for the environ ment,
as less carbon-based energy will be used.71 Conven -
tionally,  the  impacts  of  mobile  phones  have  been
grouped into three categories: incremental (improv -
ing the speed and efﬁciency of what people already
do), transformational (offering something new) and
related  to  production  (selling  mobiles  and  related
services).  The  impact  of  mobile  phones  has  been 
most  profound  in  devel op ing  countries,  where
telephone communications in the past were reserved
for the rich.72

Box 7.4 Internet shopping

Sainsbury’s is the third largest chain of supermarkets in the UK. Sainsbury’s Online is
the internet shopping brand, where customers choose their grocery items online and
items are delivered to customers from a local store (165 stores operate an online
service) by van. This service is available to nearly 90 per cent of the UK population.
In 2005, Sainsbury’s Online tested Smith Electric Vehicles in its home shopping

delivery applications in and around Central London. The year-long trial proved so
successful that Sainsbury’s placed an order for eight vehicles in 2007 and a further 50 
in 2008. Each zero emission van will reduce emissions by 5 tonnes of CO2 per year.

Planning and Design for Sustainable Urban Mobility

Urban planning
has a major role to
play in organizing
spatial activities
in cities so that
they are in close
proximity to their
users

Regardless of the
form of the city, it
is important to
develop around
highly accessible
public transport
nodes so that the
attractiveness of
these areas is fully
realized

REDUCING TRAVEL
DISTANCES IN CITIES
Urban spatial structure (or urban form)73 is important
in determining trans port mode and distance travelled,
as  it  links  the  spatial  distribution  of  population 
and jobs within the city to the pattern of trips. Thus,
urban  planning  has  a  major  role  to  play  in  organ-
izing spatial activities in cities so that they are in close
proximity  to  their  users.  Two  important  factors 
are at work here. First, if travel distances are reduced
then  accessibility  is  improved  as  activities  can  be
under taken  with  less  travel.  Second,  if  travel  dis -
tances are short, then it becomes more attractive to
walk and cycle – particularly if space is allocated for
exclusive rights of way – and to use public transport,
and  this  in  turn  reduces  the  energy  use  and  the
environ mental impacts of transport.

Such  an  approach  implies  that  the  available
street space in cities can be optimized for the highest
number of users. An increased focus on urban plan -
ning means that the city operates more efﬁciently,
but it also increases equity as services and facilities
become accessible to the entire population. Optim -
ization of street space, however, is not only a matter
of urban planning. Efﬁcient trafﬁc engin eering design,
supply  and  demand  management,  enforcement  of
trafﬁc law and efﬁcient governance at the city level
are necessary requisites for introducing and sustain -
ing urban trans port services and facilities in devel -
op ing countries.

Many cities in devel op ing countries are growing
rapidly,  driven  by  inward  migration  and  popula-
tion  growth.  This  implies  a  considerable  potential 
for urban planning to keep travel distances as short
as possible. Peripheral sprawl needs to be discouraged
as it uses valuable agricultural land, because it in -
creases travel distances and makes the provision of
public trans port more difﬁcult. The arguments for

high urban densities are strong on both trans port and
land take reasons, and cities should be encouraged
to build upwards (higher buildings) and not outwards
(suburban sprawl).74

Regardless of the form of the city, it is important
to  develop around  highly  accessible  public  trans-
port nodes so that the attractiveness of these areas
is fully realized. These areas integrate land use and
trans port  through  the  promotion  of  high-density
devel op ment  around  accessible  points  and  inter -
changes on the public trans port network, facilitat-
ing walking and cycling and increased use of public
trans port systems.  Devel op ment  needs  to  include
mixed uses, covering housing, jobs, schools, shops,
health facilities, educa tional services (e.g. crèches)
and recreational oppor tunities, so that all activities
can take place in one location. Such devel op ments
are particularly important for women, who often have
quite complex travel patterns.75

Trans port  devel op ment  areas  often  become 
the new mega nodes within cities where people meet
to carry out their business and social activities, and
they consequently promote social cohesion. These
public trans port interchanges can thus become the
new  commercial  hubs  for  cities,  for  example  in
Canary Wharf, London (Box 7.5) and Shin Yokohama
(Japan). Singapore (Table 7.4) has also constructed
public housing close to the metro stations, and this
allows lower income people access to both housing
and transport.76 Such public trans port interchanges
can often be ﬁnanced by developers, as has been the
case in Hong Kong, Singapore, Frankfurt and London.
Apart from the major contribution that trans port
devel op ment areas can play in encouraging sus tain -
able mobility in cities, they are seen as central to the
urban regeneration process that involves the creation
of new city places and spaces, and there is usually
strong community involvement so that the beneﬁts
can be widely distributed across all social groups.

Box 7.5 Trans port accessibility to Canary Wharf, London, UK

Canary Wharf is a major business and ﬁnan cial district located
in the eastern part of London. It contains around 1.3 million
square metres of ofﬁce and retail space and a workforce of
around 93,000 people (in 2009). It is home to global or
European headquarters of numerous major banks, professional
services ﬁrms and media organizations.

Construction began on the old docks area in 1988 as

part of a major urban regeneration programme. A key element
of the planning was to ensure high-quality access by public
trans port through the extension of the Jubilee Line metro, the
new Docklands Light Railway, improved bus services, river
boat services and cycle routes. There is little parking available,
but a substantial amount of residential devel op ment has taken
place in the riverside areas surrounding Canary Wharf.

A survey was carried out in June/July 2009 within the

local areas and Canary Wharf to measure the movement of
people throughout the area and in particular those travelling
to Canary Wharf. During the survey period only 5.1 per cent
of workers at Canary Wharf travelled by car, down from 6.2
per cent in 2007. Cycling has increased in popularity across
London and Canary Wharf is no exception. Nearly 4 per cent
of workers cycled to work in 2009, up from 2.9 per cent in
2007.

Use of public transport, including the Jubilee Line and the
Docklands Light Railway, continues to increase, especially from
areas east of Canary Wharf, reﬂecting the area’s rapid
regeneration and the increased number of Canary Wharf-
based workers living in East London. About 90 per cent of all
people coming to Canary Wharf do so by public transport.

City and Singapore

Urban Mobility and the Environment

New York City (population 8.2 million in 790km2)

Singapore (population 5 million in 700km2)

Background information: Manhattan (population 1.6 million) covers 
53km2 and has 35 per cent of the total regional jobs, with the Midtown 
having 2160 jobs per hectare.
Measures:
•  Strict zoning with ‘ﬂoor area ratio’ 11–15.a
•  Mixed zoning – ofﬁce, commercial, recreational and housing.
•  Transit system operational throughout 24 hours.
•  Parking spaces taxed by municipality, and most parking is provided 

privately and off-street.

•  Increasing the subway network to 337 kilometres – transit density of 

56 kilometres per million population.

Background information: Singapore has a compact urban structure 
supported by high-quality public transport.

Measures:
•  Restraint on car ownership, use and costs through quota system, 

electronic road pricing, fuel taxation and parking controls.

•  Public housing areas some located at metro stations to give easy access to 

employment.

•  Some decentralization to regional centres to reduce travel distances.
•  Reductions in need to travel and dependency on car though providing 

high-quality alternatives.

•  Encourage walk and cycle – 21 per cent trips in New York City are walk 

and cycle and a further 55 per cent by mass transit.

•  Ensure the working environ ment is intellectual, fertile and innovative.

•  Rail network to double from 138 kilometres to 278 kilometres by 2020 
(US$14 billion) – transit density of 51 kilometres per million population 
(2020).

Note: a The ﬂoor area ratio refers to the ratio of ﬂoor space to the land area of the devel op ment – so a ratio of 11 means that 11,000 square metres of ﬂoor space can be built on
a piece of land measuring 1000 square metres.

CHANGING THE MODAL 
SPLIT
Trans port policy has often been strongly orientated
towards  maintaining  and  increasing  the  levels  of
public trans port use in the city. However, success has
been limited, as other factors have intervened, such
as increases in incomes and growing urban popula -
tions. These factors have meant that the car and the
motorcycle have become dominant. It is important to
the quality of life and to the environ ment that as much
urban  travel  as  possible  is  undertaken  by  non-
motorized and public transport, as these modes are
the  most  environ mentally  efﬁcient.  In  many  Euro-
pean cities up to 60 per cent of all trips are made 
by walking, cycling or public transport. A survey of
26  cities  in  four  EU  countries  indicated  that  the
proportion of trips by car ranges from 17 to 73 per
cent. The interesting point to note from this survey
is the variability in modal shares, and that there does
not  seem  to  be  any  direct  relationship  between
population  density  (or  size)  and  the  prevalence  of
speciﬁc trans port modes.77 However, high-capacity
public transport systems, such as BRT, can offer a
viable  alternative  to  car  depen dence  in  cities  of
developing countries (see Box 7.6).

It is essential that the full cost of the energy used
in transport, including all externalities, is reﬂected
in the price.78 Real cost increases reduce the amount
of energy used (and thus the greenhouse gases emit -
ted)  and  reduce  travel  distances  (as  they  encour-
age more local travel) and the greater use of non-
motorized and public transport. This full economic
price could be based on the carbon content of the
fuel, but it also needs to include a number of other
external factors.79 There are three basic groups of
strategies that can be used to encourage modal shift
to more energy-efﬁcient forms of transport, namely:
regulatory  measures,  pricing  measures  and  invest -
ments in public transport.80

Regulatory  measures can  place  limitations 
on the numbers of vehicles on the road at any given
time or day. Limitations can also be placed on the
number of new vehicles that can be registered in the
city. For example, both Beijing and Singapore use 
a  quota  system.  In  Singapore,  the  Land  Transport
Authority allocates quotas for each vehicle category
according to the current trafﬁc conditions and the
number of vehicles taken off the roads permanently
(Table  7.4).  The  vehicle  quota  for  a  given  year  is
administered through the monthly release of ‘certiﬁ -
cates of entitlement’ and the certiﬁcates are allocated

Box 7.6  Promoting sustainable transport solutions in Eastern African cities

The ‘Sustainable Transport Solutions in East African Cities’
project (SUSTRAN) aims to reduce growth in private
motorized vehicles, thus reducing trafﬁc congestion and
greenhouse gas emissions in the cities of Addis Ababa
(Ethiopia), Kampala (Uganda) and Nairobi (Kenya). The project
– which is implemented by UN-Habitat in collaboration with
UNEP with ﬁnancial support from the Global Environment
Facility – includes support for the design and implementation
of transport corridors featuring BRT, non-motorized

transport and travel demand management measures. It also
supports regional capacity building, including city-to-city
learning. While collaborating with local metropolitan and
transport authorities, the project has promoted the active
involvement of current transport operators and other
stakeholders. By 2035, it is projected that this initiative will
have led to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions amounting
to more than 2.5 million tonnes.

Very few cities
have introduced
pricing as a
mechanism to
limit the numbers
of cars coming
into the central
area

Planning and Design for Sustainable Urban Mobility

through an auction.81 In Bogotá, Colombia, the pico
y placa (Box 7.7) limits the numbers of vehicles on
the road on a given day by allowing odd and even
number  plates  to  be  used  on  alternative  days.82
However, this latter type of measure may encourage
higher income-residents to buy a second car, often
with an older, less efﬁcient engine (thus leading to
increased emissions).

Parking regulations are important as this relates
to the allocation of space in cities by price and time
of  day,  and  it  covers  both  on-street  and  off-street
locations (Box 8.5). As part of the congestion charging
scheme in London, UK (introduced in 2003), parking
availability was reassessed both within the pricing area
(to reduce it) and outside the area to encourage com -
muters to leave their cars at home.83 Many cities have
also introduced park-and-ride schemes where drivers
leave their cars at the periphery and continue their
journeys into the centre by public transport. A recent
survey of 45 schemes in Europe found rather uneven
implementation, but where deployment had taken
place there was strong public support, as trafﬁc levels
and levels of pollution had been reduced.84

Pricing  measures include  electronic  road
pricing (Singapore), congestion charging or cordon
pricing  (London,  UK,  and  Stockholm,  Sweden),85
and parking pricing to reﬂect the value of the space
used. But very few cities have introduced pricing as
a mechanism to limit the numbers of cars coming
into the central area, and even in those cities that
have introduced schemes, it has only covered a small
part  of  the  city.  In  addition,  fuel  prices  are  often
taxed,  although  the  levels  vary  considerably  from
country to country, as it relates both to the levels of
duty imposed and the additional national and local
taxes imposed.86 Some countries have tried to use
fuel duty escalators, so that the real price of petrol
and  diesel  increase  over  time  to  reﬂect  the  full
economic costs, but this has proved unpopular with
the  oil  industry,  car  manufacturers,  as  well  as
motorists.87 All of these measures have primarily been
introduced to raise revenues88 and to address conges -
tion issues, even though it has been acknowledged
that there are also environ mental beneﬁts.89

Public trans port fare subsidies can have social
objectives in increasing the mobility of low-income

Box 7.7 TransMilenio: Supporting sus tain able mobility in Bogotá, Colombia

The ﬁrst two phases of the TransMilenio BRT system in
Bogotá, Colombia, were completed by 2003, and it has a total
of 84 kilometres of median busways, about 25 per cent of
which is completely segregated from other trafﬁc. The ﬁnal
phase (of another 100 kilometres, which was due to be
completed in 2012) has been delayed due to unresolved
political issues (including plans to construct a metro).

By 2011, the BRT system included some 1190 articulated

buses, 10 bi-articulated buses, 114 access stations (with
prepayment), 6 terminals and 4 intermediate integrated
stations. In addition there were 448 feeder buses, running on
61 feeder routes with 420 line-kilometres. TransMilenio is
frequently cited as a ‘good practice’ BRT project, and it carries
some 1.7 million passen gers per weekday, with 43,000 passen -
gers moving each hour in one direction. The uniqueness of
Bogotá’s system is the ‘transformation of a busway corridor
with severe pollution, safety problems and aesthetically
displeasing into a new BRT system with signiﬁcantly lower
travel times, lower noise and fewer greenhouse gas
emissions’.a

By drastically reducing existing travel times and acting on
the radial corridors connecting residential areas to the central
business district, TransMilenio has done much to reinforce the
attractiveness of the city centre. Public acceptance of the
project is over 70 per cent, but there have been complaints
about over crowding and the time taken for interchange from
the feeder lines. Further more, many people still lack access to
the system as the network does not extend to the locations
where the poor are living. In 2005, the population located in
the more remote parts of the city accounted for 65 per cent
of the total population, as the land there was cheaper and thus

more affordable for low-income people. In fact, land-use value
increases around the TransMilenio corridors have been
estimated to be close to 20 per cent.

While the TransMilenio system has played an important

role in contributing to more sus tain able mobility system in
Bogotá, it is worth noting that it was introduced as part of
wider policy package, which also included the following
components:

• Devel op ment of 285,500 square metres of walkways,

green spaces, road dividers, sidewalks and shaded
promenades, with 11 metropolitan parks, 3149 neigh bour -
hood parks and 323 smaller scale parks.

• Construction of 350 kilometres of bikeways contributed
to an increase in bicycle use from 1 per cent in 1995 to 
7 per cent in 2010, when there were a total of 1498 bike
parking locations.
In addition, the introduction of the ciclovia system implies
that some 120 kilometres of main roads are closed to
motor vehicles for seven hours every Sunday, so that
streets can be used by people for walking, cycling, jogging
and meeting each other.
Peak and license plate (pico y placa) restrictions during
peak hours (6–9 am and 4–7 pm) using plate numbers for
40 per cent of the private cars.
Fees and taxes: 20 per cent petrol surcharge (revenue
allocated to public trans port infra struc ture and road
maintenance) and car-free weekday in February (approved
by popular vote).

households,  but  it  is  important  that  such  subsidy 
goes to the identiﬁed user. It is also important to
make sure that the quality of the public trans port
ﬂeet is maintained at a high environ mental standard,
and that operators are given an incentive to invest.
But  sub sidies  have  much  wider  impacts  on  liveli -
hoods, as illustrated by a study of public trans port
in Sub-Saharan Africa:

‘Subsidies and other forms of compensation can
help formal public trans port but an integrated
framework  and  a  level  playing  ﬁeld  are  also
needed  for  all  types  of  trans port  to  ﬂourish.
Finan cial mechanisms should be put in place to
support  the  system,  integrating  the  different
types of collective trans port rather than allowing
proﬁts to be scooped up by the informal sector
with no regard for the burden of costs they might
place  on  local  govern ments  and  society  as  a
whole. This can include trust funds, better credit
facilities, land-value capture and other sources
of  revenues  that  can  be  used  to  help  build 
sus tain able low-carbon  trans port  systems  that
will  allow  Africa  to  ﬂourish  and  develop
economically.’90

As  noted  above,  subsidization  is  a  form  of
incentive  to  encourage  people  to  change  their
behaviour, and it can also apply to cars. For example,
incentives can be given to encourage the purchase
of more efﬁcient cars and electric vehicles, where
purchase prices are subsidized, or where preferential
parking  is  given,  or  exemption  from  paying  the
congestion  charge  is  given.  All  three  of  these
incentives have been introduced in the UK.91

Investment in public trans port and public
trans port infra struc ture are both central to make
sure that priority is given to this trans port mode, as
it allows the greatest number of people to be carried
most efﬁciently. Public trans port has to share space
on congested roads with other trafﬁc, and this re -
duces its efﬁciency. Trams have provided one effec -
tive means to introduce ‘clean’ trans port that has a
clear  priority  through  control  (trafﬁc  signals)  and
exclusive tracks.92

More  recently,  BRT  is  seen  as  a  ﬂexible  and
cheap means to invest in high-quality public trans -
port with a separate right of way.93 As discussed in
Chapter  3,  BRT  potentially  offers  a  high-capacity,
relatively  inexpensive  and  ﬂexible  form  of  public
trans port in many cities. BRT systems have good envir -
on mental credentials  and  can  be  introduced  in  a
variety of different forms. Box 7.7 looks at how BRT
can be combined into part of an integrated set of
measures that have the potential to change percep -
tions of public transport.

TECHNOLOGICAL
INNOVATION AND VEHICLE
EFFICIENCY
This section presents technological and other policy
responses  related  to  increasing  the  efﬁciency  of
motorized vehicles and the use of the best available
technology.  This  implies  that  the  use  of  carbon-
based  fuels  should  be  substantially  reduced  and
cleaner low-carbon fuels should replace them for all
forms of motorized trans port (freight and passen ger).
As noted earlier in this chapter, the amount of CO2
produced by motorized vehicles is directly related to
the amount of fuel used, and there is considerable
potential for reductions.94

However,  it  should  be  remembered  that  efﬁ -
ciency  gains  must  be  set  against  the  growth  in
trafﬁc,95 as  this  often  outweighs  those  gains.  The
discussion below focuses on four main issues, namely:
the efﬁciency and age of the vehicle stock, standards
of fuels used in vehicles, the potential of alternative
fuels, and vehicle occupancy.

It  is  here  important  to  note  that  there  is  a
substantial potential for technological ‘leapfrogging’.
Thus  there  is  no  reason  why  cities  in  devel op ing
countries have to follow the same high-motorization
(and  high-pollution)  pathway  as  that  followed  in
developed  countries.  Rapid  urbanization  in  many
devel op ing countries thus presents an opportunity
to invest in the low-carbon city trans port system of
the future. That having been said, it is important to
note  that  this  cannot  be  undertaken  without  sub -
stantial ﬁnan cial support from the developed coun -
tries. This means that effective mechanisms need to
be established, such as the fuel security credits being
tested by the Asian Devel op ment Bank,96 or initiatives
under  the  clean  devel op ment  mechanism  of  the
Kyoto Protocol.97

Efﬁciency and age of the vehicle stock
The scale of any emission reduction is dependent on
a set of factors such as the efﬁciency and turnover
rate of the vehicle stock, the distance driven by each
vehicle, and the tendency to buy larger and heavier
vehicles. New vehicle technology has reduced the
fuel use per unit of power by 50 per cent over a 15
year period (1990–2005), yet most of that potential
saving has been negated by the overall increase in
power and weight, particularly in the US. Thus the
net effect has been no change.98

The introduction of new technologies does not,
however, lead to immediate cuts in emissions. The
efﬁciency of any single vehicle on the road is always
lower than that of the newest technology. In general,
this  implies  that  overall  emissions  depend  on  the
average  age  of  the  vehicle  ﬂeet  in  any  particular
country (or city). And, in the countries with the oldest

Vehicle age (years)

vehicle ﬂeets, maintenance becomes a central issue.
In general, the average age of vehicles in developed
countries  is  lower  than  in  devel op ing  countries,
where the average age of vehicles can be more than
15 years99 (Figure 7.4). There are some exceptions
however, such as Brazil, which is one of the few devel -
op ing  countries  with  its  own  car  manufacturing
industry.100 Some  of  the  vehicles  in  devel op ing
countries operate for more than 40 years. These older
vehicles are responsible for a disproportionately high
percentage of air pollution, despite their relatively
low numbers:

‘The  main  reasons  for  the  persistence  of  old
technology include the high cost of new vehicles,
the relatively low maintenance and support cost
for older technology, and a lack of govern ment
ﬂeet  renewal  incentives  (including  inspection
and maintenance regimes).’101

However, there are examples, even from devel -
op ing  countries  of  successful  schemes  of  upgrad-
ing the vehicle ﬂeet. In Cairo, Egypt, for example,
the  govern ment  has  initiated  a  scheme  to  renew 
the  taxi  ﬂeet.  The  project  started  in  2007  with 
the  introduction  of  100  new  air-conditioned  (and
metered) taxis, fuelled by CNG. In 2009, through a
joint scheme with ﬁve car companies, three banks,
advertising  agencies  (who  were  given  the  right  to
place  advertisements  on  the  taxis)  and  owners  of
scrapping  yards,  the  scheme  was  launched  at  full
scale. By 2013, a total of 43,000 old taxis had been
replaced.102

Most  devel op ing  and  transitional  countries  –
with  the  major  exceptions  being  Brazil,  India  and
China – do not have their own car manufacturing
industry. The majority of devel op ing countries are
thus relying on imported vehicles. And, due to the

cost of new vehicles, many of the imported vehicles
are second-hand. In effect, developed countries are
exporting  their  less  efﬁcient  and  more  polluting
vehicles  to  devel op ing  countries.  Over  the  period
2005–2008, for example, 2.45 million vehicles were
imported to Mexico from the US and Canada (with
an average age of 11.4 years). The vehicles exported
from the US to Mexico had higher emissions levels
of hydrocarbons (4 per cent higher), carbon monoxide
(4 per cent higher) and nitrogen dioxide (22 per cent
higher) than the average vehicle in the US. Yet, the
emissions of these vehicles were still lower than that
of the existing ﬂeet in Mexico.103

In order to address the issue of this ‘dumping’
of  polluting  vehicles,  a  number  of  countries  have
introduced  technology-  or  age-restrictions  on  im -
ported vehicles. In Kenya, for example, only models
that are eight years old or less can be imported.104
In Belarus, the govern ment discourages the import
of older cars through high import duties.105

Standards of fuels used and emissions
from vehicles
The emission of pollutants from motorized vehicles
is related to three main factors: the quality of the
fuel, the fuel efﬁciency of the vehicle stock and the
capture of pollutants before they escape from the
vehicle. These are discussed in more detail below.
Considerable  progress  is  being  made  in
improving the quality of fuel used and the efﬁciency
of  the  conventional  petrol  and  diesel  internal
combustion  engine,  so  that  the  typical  car  is  now
some 35 per cent more efﬁcient than it was ten years
ago. This improvement can be directly translated into
reductions in CO2 emissions.106 The EU has intro -
duced legislation (2009) for a reduction of the green -
house gas intensity of fuels by up to 10 per cent by

2020  –  a  ‘low  carbon  fuel  standard’.  This  will  be
achieved through the greater use of renewable energy
in electric vehicles, and the use of biomass sources,
such as bio ethanol that is already mixed with fuel
(5 per cent).107

Even though diesel vehicles produce less CO2
per  unit  of  distance  travelled,  their  increasing
dominance in the vehicle ﬂeet (both passen ger and
freight) has been negated by the greater distances
travelled.  Diesel  vehicles  also  tend  to  have  larger
emissions of other pollutants, such as nitrogen oxides
and  particulate  matter  (Box  7.2).  As  a  result,  the
WHO has recently stated that diesel exhaust causes
cancer, and has called for tighter emission standards,
comparing  the  risk  of  exhaust  to  second-hand
cigarette smoke.108

In India, the fuel quality standards for trans port
fuels  are  legislated  under  the  environ mental
Protection Act (which follows the EU speciﬁcations).
New  speciﬁcations  have  been  introduced  in  two
phases, ﬁrst applied in 13 major cities109 and then
followed  by  nationwide  implementation.  India  has
used unleaded petrol nationwide since 2000.110

Reductions in the sulphur levels in diesel have
major  effects  on  emissions,  as  many  devel op-
 ing  countries  have  very  high  sulphur  levels111 in
diesel fuels. Reducing sulphur to very low levels112
also reduces the emissions of particulate matter, and
it enables emission control technologies that provide
even greater emission reductions (i.e. diesel oxidation
catalysts and diesel particulate ﬁlters).113 For petrol
vehicles, low sulphur levels114 in fuel improve the
performance of catalytic converter systems that are
standard in developed countries. Low sulphur levels
are  now  being  introduced  in  most  devel op ing
countries as well, through the importation of new
and second-hand cars.115

Govern ments are increasingly looking towards
vehicle manufacturers to improve the fuel efﬁciency

of  the  vehicle  stock.  Many  govern ments  are  now
setting more challenging mandatory targets for fuel
efﬁciency in new vehicles, and this single action will
substantially reduce CO2 and other emissions from
the trans port sector.116 The EU tried, unsuccessfully,
to introduce voluntary agreements with the vehicle
manufacturers  during  the  last  decade.  It  is  only
recently (2009) that mandatory targets have been set.
However, the fact that good progress has already been
made  towards  these  targets  may  suggest  that  the
targets are not tough enough. Figure 7.5 shows that
there is a clear downward trend in the emissions of
CO2 from new vehicles and the ﬂeet-wide mandatory
targets set by the EU will be a benchmark for other
manufacturers.

Many  pollutants  can  be  ﬁltered  out  through 
the use of catalytic converters, particulate traps and
other technologies, although this means that addi -
tional  costs  are  imposed  on  vehicle  owners.  It  is,
however, also important to ensure that the ﬁlters are
working effectively, and this again relates to regular
maintenance  and  testing  of  vehicles.  Catalytic
converters do not work when engines are cold, and
so  for  many  short  journeys  the  pollutants  are  not
being  ﬁltered  out.  Regulations  in  Europe  have
gradually been tightened up so that emissions levels
for all vehicles (including freight vehicles) conform
to EU standards.117 These standards are also being
adopted  elsewhere,  for  example  in  Russia118 and
China.119 The US and Japan have their own emissions
standards that have been tougher than those in the
EU  until  2000,  but  all  three  have  since  followed
essentially the same path and are converging towards
zero emissions for all pollutants.

Due to the fact that the emission standards only
apply to new vehicles, it takes a considerable time
before their full beneﬁts are realized, as existing older
vehicles have to be scrapped and replaced by new
vehicles.120 Despite the clear intentions to reduce

key emissions from vehicles, in practice it will take
10–15  years  to  work  its  way  through  the  entire
vehicle stock in developed countries. In devel op ing
countries, with their considerably older vehicle stock
it will take even longer.

Add-on  technology  (principally  the  catalytic
converter),  cleaner  fuels  and  more  efﬁcient  and
lighter  vehicles  have  helped  reduce  the  levels  of
pollutants from petrol engine vehicles by 80 per cent.
There  are,  however,  questions  about  whether  the
technology  is  working  efﬁciently  and  the  rate  of
change in the existing vehicle ﬂeet, particularly in
those cities with the most rapid increase in levels of
car ownership. Further more, there are still concerns
over whether the same levels of air quality improve -
ment can be achieved in diesel vehicles.121 And, the
problem of particulates is still present as this results
from fuels (diesel), from tyres and from other sources,
and this is much harder to control (and is a particular
problem for freight trucks in urban areas).

The  belief  that  add-on  technology  can  ‘solve’ 
the air quality issue is too simple. As noted above,
there are important limitations relating to whether
the catalytic converters are working, whether diesel
emissions  can  be  controlled  effectively,  the  time
taken  for  all  vehicles  to  be  ﬁtted,  and  the  slow
switch  to  alternative  fuels.  When  set  against  the
growth in car ownership and use, the catalytic con -
verter  really  only  gives  a  maximum  of  ten  years
‘breathing space’ before pollution levels start to rise
again. In the US, for example, the catalytic converter
has been compulsory since 1979, and the full beneﬁts
have already worked their way into the entire car
ﬂeet. The CO2 problem has not been addressed, as
reduction in fuel use is the only means to reduce
such emissions.122

Alternative fuels
In order to reduce the dependence on oil – and to
reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases and other
pollutants – there has been much debate over the
introduction  of  alternative  fuels  in  the  trans port
sector. However, while searching for alternatives, it
is  important  to  keep  in  mind  the  fact  that  both
petrol and diesel have very high energy densities,123
and  that  there  have  already  been  substantial
investments  in  support  infra struc ture  in  most
countries (e.g. fuel stations). Thus, alternatives need
to  have  a  high  energy  output  and  they  must  be
produced  cleanly  and  cheaply,  and  in  sufﬁcient
quantities.

In  the  near  future,  it  is  unlikely  that  any
alternative fuel can replace the established oil-based
sources  of  fuel,  as  they  cannot  be  produced  (or
distributed) in the quantities required. This means
that all alternative fuels are likely to be niche markets.
However, these may in turn develop to mass-market
options in the longer term. In situations where there

is less established supporting infra struc ture (e.g. in
devel op ing countries), the introduction of new fuels
may happen earlier. This provides an opportunity to
initiate new solutions to urban motorization in devel -
op ing  countries.  This  is  already  evident  in  some
countries through the use of BRT and electric vehicles
(including e-bikes).

In terms of policy, the EU seeks to halve the 
use of conventionally fuelled cars by 2030, to phase
such  cars  out  of  cities  by  2050,  and  to  achieve
carbon-free goods movement in cities by 2030. The
EU believes that technological innovation will play a
major role in this process, combined with regulations
and standards being set by individual govern ments,
demand management, road pricing and local city-level
controls.124

The public discussion related to alternative fuels
started with a focus on greater efﬁciency within
existing internal combustion engines. As discussed
above, efﬁciency levels have improved substantially,
and a further halving of CO2 emissions is expected
over the next ten years (Figure 7.5). Public debate
has  since  moved  onto  biofuels and  hydrogen.
However, the potential of biofuels has been restricted
by the conﬂicts arising from increasing food prices,
as increasing production of energy crops has led to
reduced  areas  of  agricultural  land  producing  food
crops.125 The production of liquid fuels from sugar,
biomass and cellulose also requires huge amounts of
water. Likewise, the potential of hydrogen as a clean
fuel  has  been  questioned  because  of  the  energy
required  in  its  production  (often  from  carbon
products, such as oil or coal), and because of issues
related  to  the  storage  and  distribution  of  the
hydrogen.126

More recently, the electric vehicle has emerged
as a more suitable alternative for urban transport.
Such vehicles include hybrid electric vehicles, plug-
in  hybrid  electric  vehicles127 and  other  electric
vehicles (including battery-driven vehicles). Increased
use of such vehicles would solve many of the local
pollution problems. However, the energy still has to
be generated (often from coal), and there are issues
relating to the recharging infra struc ture, the use of
materials and the need for a lifecycle approach to
energy use and emissions.128

The  most  positive  devel op ments  have  come
from  hybrid  vehicles  that  combine  conventional
internal  combustion  engine  with  electric  vehicle
technology, as this allows both electric power at low
speeds  and  a  combination  of  internal  combustion
engine and electric power at higher speeds. In such
hybrid vehicles, the conventional engine is supported
by a battery that can be recharged while the vehicle
is being used. Greenhouse gases and other pollutants
are still being emitted, but these vehicles provide a
direct substitute for the conventional car, but use
only about 60 per cent of the fuel. Over the lifetime
of the car it is likely that there are cost savings to

Box 7.8 Sus tain able trans port in Hangzhou, China

The city of Hangzhou (population 8.1 million in 2009) seeks to
build a highly integrated and low-carbon intensive trans port
network that consists of metro, BRT, cycle and walking, water
trans port and electric vehicles. A key element of this strategy
is the world’s largest public bicycle programme. In 2009, some
67 per cent of all trips were by foot, cycle and electric bike.
This accounted for 9.6 million out of 14.4 million trips made
each day – the CO2 emissions per trip are 250 grammes
(about a third of the level in London). The sus tain able trans -
port strategy includes the following elements:

• A metro system of 69 kilometres (2011), to be extended

to 278 kilometres by 2050.

• Nine BRT routes, with a further ten planned for 2020.
•

Smart card operated systems for buses, taxis, bicycles and
other forms of public transport.
Seamless connections and zero interchange strategies for
public trans port transfers.

•

the  user,  as  the  higher  purchase  prices  are  com -
pensated for by lower fuel costs.

China has introduced a series of policies aiming
to  facilitate  electric  vehicle  industrialization  and
commercialization,  including  pilot  projects,  stan-
dard  announcements  and  purchase  subsidies.  In 
the industrial sector, a group of car manufacturers
has  announced  mass  production  plans  for  electric
vehicles.129 In some cities, electric vehicles are begin -
ning to make a signiﬁcant impact in terms of their
share of public trans port and public service vehicle
ﬂeets.  This  includes  delivery  vehicles,  buses  and
other services (e.g. taxis). In June 2010, six cities
were chosen to implement electric vehicle purchase
subsidies with a maximum of US$9000 per vehicle
in the private car market.130 One of these ‘electric’
trans port  cities  is  Hangzhou,  where  a  variety  of
meas ures have been combined to achieve an inno -
vative  and  environ mentally  beneﬁcial  trans port
pathway (Box 7.8).

Although, worldwide, most attention has been
given to technological innovation for the private car,
there is also considerable potential within cities to
use electric power and hybrid technologies for public
and freight transport. London, UK, for example, had
more than 300 hybrid buses in operation by Decem -
ber  2012,131 and  similar  initiatives  are  currently
underway in Latin America (Box 7.9). Electric trucks
have  been  used  for  local  deliveries  (Box  7.4)  and
hybrid vehicles have become more commonly used
by global companies (Box 7.10). These vehicles are
intensively  used,  and  they  can  be  recharged  and
maintained at the company’s own sites.

Box 7.9 The Hybrid and Electric Bus Test Programme, Latin America

The Hybrid and Electric Bus Test Programme was launched in
June 2011 by the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group in
partnership with the Clinton Climate Initiative. In ﬁve
participating cities – Bogotá, Curitiba, Rio de Janeiro, Santiago
de Chile and São Paulo – the programme seeks to reduce the
carbon footprint of public transportation and develop a
market for fuel-efﬁcient, low-carbon buses in Latin America.
Supported by the Inter-American Devel op ment Bank,

the programme brings together cities, bus technology
companies and local trans port operators to test bus
technology performance in city-speciﬁc driving conditions and
duty cycles. Ultimately, the programme aims to catalyse the

deployment of up to 9000 buses across Latin American cities
over the next ﬁve years, with annual CO2 emission reductions
of 475,000 tonnes.

The programme compares hybrid diesel-electric

technology and conventional diesel technology. Promising
ﬁndings show that hybrid technology is at least 32 per cent
more fuel efﬁcient and produces fewer local air pollutants and
greenhouse gases than conventional diesel buses; while electric
buses have zero on-road emissions and are 250 per cent more
fuel efﬁcient than normal diesel buses.

Box 7.10 Hybrid trucks

A number of global delivery companies (FedEx, DHL, TNT and UPS) have tested
hybrid delivery trucks and these are slowly beginning to be introduced into their ﬂeets.
FedEx together with Eaton Corporation have developed a diesel hybrid electric vehicle
delivery truck and launched a pilot project with 20 hybrid electric vehicle diesel trucks
(in 2004). The Eaton truck is a medium weight pick-up delivery truck that operates in
urban areas with many short stops for collection and delivery. By 2009 FedEx had a
ﬂeet of 264 hybrid electric trucks, and they have covered more than 4 million miles of
service (2004–2009), reducing fuel use by more than 570,000 litres and CO2 emissions
by 1521 metric tonnes.

solution  to  the  environ mental impacts  of  urban
mobility. Improved vehicle standards, better fuels,
alternative  fuels  and  innovation  can  all  make  an
important contribution, but effective policy actions
here need to be combined with strategies to reduce
the need to travel, the distances travelled and the
modes of trans port used (see below).

Underlying  all  strategies,  however,  is  the
importance of vehicle occupancy (freight and passen -
ger), and the efﬁciency ﬁgures illustrate the import -
ance of occupancy (or load) (Box 7.11). Fully laden
vehicles (public and private, freight and passen ger)
are  far  more  efﬁcient  than  empty  ones.  This  also
reduces environ mental impacts, improves the quality
of  the  urban  area  and  contributes  to  reducing
congestion.

‘High-occupancy vehicle’ lanes or car-pool lanes
have  been  introduced  in  some  cities  (primarily  in
developed  countries)  to  increase  vehicle  occupan-
cies. Vehicles that travel in a high-occupancy vehicle
lane must carry at least one (sometimes two) passen -
gers in addition to the driver. Some high-occupancy
vehicle  lanes  are  in  operation  only  during  certain
hours. Outside of those hours, they may be used by
all  vehicles.132 High-occupancy  vehicle  lanes  have 
also  been  introduced  in  some  devel op ing  coun-

Box 7.11  Freight loads and emissions standards

New regulations in many cities restrict access to the city centre based on the age and
load of the vehicle:

In Amsterdam (the Netherlands), a truck may make deliveries in limited access
zones if it meets the following four conditions: it must be less than eight years old,
meet the Euro II standard, have a maximum length of 10 metres, and load or
unload at least 80 per cent of its merchandise in the central city.
In London, the Low Emission Zone (set up in 2008) prohibits trucks older than the
Euro III standard to enter the metropolitan area (the area surrounded by the M25
highway, totalling 1580 square kilometres).
In Tokyo, since 2003, the most polluting diesel vehicles have been prohibited from
the city centre.

tries. On such example is South Africa where such
lanes have been introduced to facilitate bus trans -
port in particular.133 According to critics, however,
few buses are using these lanes – primarily because
the  lanes  are  on  the  wrong  side  of  the  road  with
respect  to  loading  and  off-loading  of  passen gers,
forci ng buses to constantly change lanes – and, due
to lack of controls, these lanes are now used primarily
by private cars.134

THE COMPOSITE 
SOLUTION
The preceding sections have presented a number of
examples  of  interventions  to  enhance  environ -
mentally  sus tain able urban  mobility  systems.  Each 
of the examples has illustrated the impact of speciﬁc
types of policies. In most cases of successful imple -
mentation, however, it is not a single policy that has
been introduced – but rather a package of measures.
Such  ‘packages’  are  more  likely  to  gain  public
acceptance, and they allow a mixture of policies that
may be seen as dis advan tageous to individual users,
but promote overall welfare gains to society (see for
example Box 7.7). Yet, while policy packaging can
certainly support effective and efﬁcient policy-making
(not least through enhancing interventions’ imple -
mentation and the ex-ante mitigation of unintended
effects), the packaging process requires a deep and
holistic appreciation of policy subsystems, together
with a structured approach, if its beneﬁts are to be
genuinely realized.135

To promote the environ mental argument it is
important to consider a wide range of effects that
contribute co-beneﬁts. For example, health can be
viewed in three main ways, as less motorized trafﬁc
or  ‘cleaner’  vehicles  improve  local  air  quality,  as
slower travel leads to improvements in road safety
and  as  non-motorized  trans port has  direct  health
beneﬁts. In addition, these improvements are likely
to have a positive effect on climate change through
reductions in CO2 emissions. All these factors lead
to important co-beneﬁts that need to be included in
all environ mental evaluation.

In order to achieve the EU 2050 target of zero
carbon  emissions  from  trans port  in  cities136 some
communities have started moving towards the ‘car-
free  city’.  One  such  community  is  Vauban  (in
Freiburg, Germany). It was constructed on a scale
that facilitates movement by local public transport,
walking and cycling (Box 7.12). Vauban offers one
example  of  how  many  of  the  different  elements
outlined in this chapter can be brought together into
a coherent set of proposals. Based on this experi ence
it seems that urban residents can live in a car-free
environ ment, provided that: the right trans port links
are established (i.e. to the main station and the city

Box 7.12 Car-free living: Vauban, Germany

Vauban is a small community of 5500 inhabitants and 600 jobs, 4 kilometres
south of the town centre of Freiburg (Germany). It was started in 1998 as ‘a
sus tain able model district’ on the site of a former military base. Although
the Vauban community itself is small, it is mixed with considerable levels of
involvement of the local people in helping to decide priorities and
alternatives (the Forum Vauban). The guiding mobility principle has been to
try to reduce the use of the car, but giving residents the ﬂexibility to use a
car where necessary. This is matched by high-quality public transport,
walking and cycling facilities.

Within Vauban, movement is mainly by foot and bicycle, and there is a
tram link to Freiburg (2006). Cycling is the main mode of trans port for most
trips and most activities, including commuting and shopping. The town is laid
out linearly along the tracks so that all homes are within easy walking
distance of a tram stop. The speed limit on the district’s main road is 30
kilometres per hour, while in the residential area cars should not drive
faster than ‘walking speed’ (5 kilometres per hour). About 70 per cent of
the households have chosen to live without a private car (2009), and the
level of car ownership (and use) has continued to fall. In the past, more than
half of all households owned a car, and among those who are now living car
free, 81 per cent had previously owned one and 57 per cent gave up their
cars on or immediately after moving to Vauban.

The trans port network in Vauban adopts a complex combination grid,

with three types of streets: collector roads, local streets and
pedestrian/bicycle paths. As indicated in the drawing, most local streets are
crescents and cul-de-sacs. While they are discontinuous for cars, they
connect to a network of pedestrian and bike paths that permeate the entire
neigh bour hood. In addition, these paths go through or by open spaces
adding to the enjoyment of the trip.

Further more, most of Vauban’s residential streets lack parking spaces.

Vehicles are allowed to drive in these streets (at walking pace) to pick up
and to deliver, but are not allowed to park, and enforcement is based on
social consensus. Each year, households are required to sign a declaration
indicating whether they own a car. If they do, they must buy a space in one

of the multi-storey car parks on the periphery (at an annual cost of €18,000
in 2008).

The implementation of the trafﬁc concept in Vauban meant that new
laws were needed to accommodate the current building regulations in the
federal state of Baden-Württemberg. The Association for Car-free Living in
Vauban (Verein für autofreies Wohnen) was founded as a legal body for the
implementation of the concept. For those that want the occasional use of a
car, the car sharing company Freiburger Auto Gemeinschaft offers cars for
occasional use by residents of Vauban, and they are parked in the
community car park. Those in the car-sharing scheme have access to the
shared cars and they also receive a one-year free pass for all public
transportation within Freiburg, as well as a 50 per cent reduction on every
train ticket for one year.

centre  of  Freiburg);  there  are  local  facilities  and
services;  and  there  are  sufﬁcient  reasons  for  not
owning a car (e.g. limited and costly parking).

Similarly, in order to improve public transport,
a  series  of  policy  interventions  are  necessary  to
create  a  positive  overall  experi ence.  This  includes
investments in new infra struc ture (including vehicles,
routes and maintenance), electronic ticketing (smart
cards), 24-hour availability and the feeling of safety
and  security.  Another  essential  requirement  is
organizational  change  that  allows  seamless  travel
and  short  interchanges  between  modes  (including
both  route  and  fare  integration).  Further more, 
high levels of public trans port occupancy137 and use
permits, lower fares and extensive networks for all
users are central to sus tain able urban mobility. All
these factors increase the efﬁciency of trans port in
the city, and in turn result in environ mental and other
co-beneﬁts (e.g. safety, health and noise). Comple -
mentary actions include the slowing down of urban

trafﬁc,  the  allocation  of  space  to  public  transport,
strong parking controls and road pricing. All of these
interventions are likely to maximize the use of public
transport.

In  addition  to  prioritizing  public  transport,
investment in separate cycle and pedestrian networks
would  strengthen  the  commitment  to  promoting
non-motorized  transport.  The  available  trans port
space in the city should be determined and allocated
based  on  prioritization  of  low-carbon  transport,
demand management and the identiﬁcation of priority
users (and uses). However, it is important to keep
in  mind  that  measures  to  encourage  modal  shift
must be combined with strategies to make the best
use  of  the  ‘released  space’  so  that  there  is  a  net
reduction in motorized trafﬁc.138 Such an approach
introduces the much wider notion of the street, as
road space is no longer considered only as a road but
as  a  space  for  people,  green  modes  and  public
transport. Creative use of that space at different times

•  Switching trans port mode from air to sea.
•  Optimizing its European road freight network by improving vehicle 

load conﬁguration to maximize use of the available capacity and using 
fewer trucks.

•  Warehousing improvements – lower stock levels.
•  Reducing the number of external warehouses to cut travel between 

sites and the warehouses.

•  Installing intelligent lighting controls and energy efﬁcient lighting.
•  Consolidation of refrigerated storage units.
•  Using energy efﬁcient forklift truck charging.

•  Green travel plans are in operation at a number of sites to encourage 

employees to reduce the environ mental impact of their travel by sharing 
vehicles, using public trans port or by cycling to work.

•  The distance ﬂown on company business fell by more than 200 million 

kilometres and nearly 85,000 fewer single ﬂights were made in 2010 
compared to 2009.

•  Signiﬁcant investment has been made in videoconferencing systems, with 

over 500 videoconference rooms in 68 countries. Other technology 
includes teleconferencing, desktop and personal videoconference units 
and web conferencing. In 2010, there was a 40 per cent increase in the
use of videoconferencing compared to 2009.

of the day or days of the week means that new uses
can  be  encouraged  (e.g.  street  markets  and  play
zones).

The experi ence of GlaxoSmithKline, one of the
largest  pharmaceutical  companies  in  the  world,
exempliﬁes how private-sector companies can reduce
their greenhouse gas emissions, and thus contribute
to more environ mentally sus tain able urban transport.
The  fact  that  such  initiatives  are  also  of  ﬁnan cial
beneﬁt  to  the  company  should  provide  additional
encouragement for other companies to reduce some
of the negative environ mental externalities of their
operations. Table 7.5 outlines measures implemented
by  GlaxoSmithKline  in  2010  with  respect  to  the
company’s freight and employee transport. However,
more recent data indicate that the company’s total
trans port emissions grew by 8.4 per cent in 2011,
thus cancelling out the gains made in 2010.139

FUNDING MECHANISMS
FOR ENVIRON MENTALLY
SUS TAIN ABLE URBAN
MOBILITY SYSTEMS
While Chapter 8 contains a more elaborate discus-
sion of funding for urban trans port investments, it
is appropriate here to make a brief reference to global
ﬁnan cial options that are directly related to environ -
mental sus tain ability. So far, the mechanisms devised
to address such funding have not been effectively
used  in  cities  or  in  the  trans port  sector.  Out  of 
the  6660  clean  devel op ment  mechanism  projects
registered by 1 April 2013, only 28 were related to
transport.140 Another ten projects were under valida -
tion, or in the process of being registered.141 The
clean devel op ment mechanism is one of the three
ﬂexible mechanisms under the Kyoto Protocol. The
clean  devel op ment  mechanism  enables  the  imple -
mentation of emissions reduction projects in devel -
op ing countries to earn ‘carbon credits’, which can
then  be  sold  internationally  (thus  being  rewarded 

for having reduced emissions). By purchasing such
carbon credits, developed countries can meet parts
of their emissions reduction targets (by paying for
the right to pollute).142

Unfortunately,  such  carbon  emissions  trading
favours the cheaper projects, which may not have the
greatest  potential  to  reduce  greenhouse  gas  emis-
sions over the longer period. Most trans port projects
are expensive as they require up-front investment 
or the devel op ment of new fuels and technologies.
Apart from the scale of change needed in the trans -
port sector, the emissions are diffuse and hard to
measure,  as  is  the  reliable  baseline  and  the  need 
to  deﬁne  project  boundaries  so  that  a  consistent
monitoring framework can be established. Thus, the
existing  carbon  market  is  not  appropriate  for  the
trans port sector, and a separate sector-based mechan -
ism may be required.

Alternatively,  there  could  be  a  greater  role
allocated to cities to reduce greenhouse gas emis-
sions in trans port and to adopt national appropriate
mitigation actions143 for city-scale application. Cer -
tainly,  there  is  a  strong  case  to  integrate  existing
funding  mechanisms  available  for  climate  change
mitigation – such as the Global Environ ment Facility
(GEF),144 the  environ mental ﬁscal  reform145 and
ofﬁcial devel op ment assistance – in the clean devel -
op ment mechanism.146

Further more, there may be considerable poten -
tial for emerging cities and countries to follow a less
carbon-intensive  pathway  when  it  comes  to  trans-
port. The Sus tain able Fuel Partnership,147 for exam -
ple, is examining the rationale behind a new market
mechan ism to provide energy incentives for improv -
ing  energy  security  in  the  Asia-Paciﬁc  region  by
treating energy security as a public good that can be
valued and translated into a cash ﬂow, and thereby
to correct market inefﬁciencies. This will be achieved
through ‘fuel security credits’ that are designed to
reduce  actual  oil  use  and  to  invest  in  trans port
projects that are less energy intensive, to examine
means by which trips can be avoided, to encourage
mode shift to public and non-motorized transport,
and to improve technologies.148

There  are  also  considerable  overlaps  between
many  general  devel op ment  programmes  –  funded
through ofﬁcial devel op ment assistance – and global
public goods programmes, including climate change
mitigations  strategies  such  as  public-sector  invest -
ments  in  clean  transportation.149 Further more,
although  it  is  currently  not  mentioned  speciﬁc-
ally, there should be considerable scope to include
funding  for  sus tain able urban  mobility  –  particu-
larly in devel op ing countries – in the discussions on
innovative  devel op ment  ﬁnancing  mechanisms
currently  being  explored  in  the  global  economic
arena.150 Thus, both of these sources of funding could
be drawn upon to ﬁnance environ mentally sus tain -
able urban mobility systems.

CONCLUDING REMARKS
AND LESSONS FOR POLICY
When  sensitively  planned  and  appropriately  sup -
ported by sus tain able infra struc ture, compact cities
are  the  world’s  most  efﬁcient  settlement  pattern.
Urban density reduces the overall spatial footprint
of devel op ment and allows for greater preservation
of natural areas. It also allows for more efﬁcient use
of trans port infra struc ture, which reduces emissions
and resource use. However, current trends in motor -
ization  and  oil  dependence  –  and  the  increased
dependence on private motorized trans port – pose
major  challenges  to  the  devel op ment  of  environ -
mentally sus tain able urban mobility systems, namely:

• greenhouse  gas  emissions:  the  main  cause  of
global  climate  change,  which  could  have  catas -
trophic impacts on urban transportation systems;
• urban sprawl: leading to increasing trip lengths
and thus increased dependence on the private car
to meet individual mobility needs;

• air  and  noise  pollution,  and  decreased  physical
activity: have major negative impacts on the health
of urban residents;

• road  trafﬁc  accidents:  are  among  the  leading
causes of premature deaths in cities all around the
world;

• community  severance:  where  major  trans port
infra struc ture disrupts neigh bour hoods and serves
as physical barriers to human interaction.

To address these challenges, there is a need for policy
interventions  that  encourage  change  in  ﬁve  major
areas, namely: a reduction of the number of motor -
ized trips made (i.e. telecommuting, online shopping
or a shift to non-motorized transport); reduced travel
distances in cities (i.e. changes to the urban form);
changes in the modal split (i.e. encouraging public
transport); technological innovations that reduce the
negative  externalities  of  motorized  trans port (i.e.

more  efﬁcient  fuels  and  reduced  emissions);  and
increased  vehicle  efﬁciency  (i.e.  higher  occupancy
rates).

Most  policy  interventions  may  be  grouped  in
three  categories:  regulatory  measures;  pricing
measures; and investments in public trans port and
public (and non-motorized) trans port infra struc ture.
Regulatory measures may be used to limit the num-
ber of cars on the roads at any particular time, or to
restrict the number of parking places in inner-city
areas, both of which may encourage a modal shift
towards public transport. Such measures may also
be used to reduce emissions from motor vehicles to
encourage the use of more energy-efﬁcient vehicles,
and to encourage more efﬁcient use of infra struc ture
and vehicles, for example through the introduction
of dedicated high-occupancy vehicle lanes.

Pricing measures may be used to discourage the
use of private motorized trans port – in the form of
electronic road pricing, congestion charging, park-
ing pricing, fuel taxes, etc. – or to encourage the use
of more energy-efﬁcient vehicles – for example sales
duties related to engine size. Similarly, such measures
may also be used in the form of subsidies to encour -
age the use of public trans port (fare subsidies) and
to encourage the purchase of more efﬁcient vehicles
(subsidies on low-emission fuels, vehicle purchase
prices,  exemptions  from  congestion  or  parking
charges, etc.).

Investments in public transport, and infra struc -
ture for public and non-motorized transport, may also
play a major role in encouraging shifts to more sus -
tain able modes of transport. Improved connectivity,
increased  capacity,  enhanced  quality  and  reduced
travel times for such modes are major factors encour -
aging city residents to reduce their reliance on the
private car.

However, the perhaps most effective approach
(at least in the longer term) to reduce the environ -
mental impact of urban mobility is to reconsider the
urban spatial structure. As discussed in Chapter 5,
urban form plays an important part in determining
both trans port mode and distance travelled, as it links
the spatial distribution of population and jobs (as well
as other destinations) to the pattern of trips. Through
increased (population and job) densities and mixed-
use devel op ments, urban planning may play a major
role in organizing spatial activities in cities so that
they  are  in  close  proximity  to  their  users.  Well-
planned, densely populated settlements can reduce
the need for private motorization and decrease travel
distances, thus making it more attractive to walk and
cycle. Further more, urban planning based on transit-
oriented devel op ment (or similar approaches) helps
to maximize urban densities around trans port nodes
and  encourages  a  modal  shift  to  public  transport.
Such an integration of land-use and trans port planning
is a core component of a strategy to create environ -
mentally sus tain able urban mobility systems.

There is a need
for policy
interventions that
encourage . . .: 
a reduction of 
the number of
motorized trips
made . . .;
reduced travel
distances in cities
. . .; changes in
the modal split 
. . .; technological
innovations that
reduce the
negative
externalities of

and increased
vehicle efﬁciency

effective approach
. . . to reduce the
environmental
impact of urban
mobility is to
reconsider the
urban spatial
structure

Planning and Design for Sustainable Urban Mobility

While  the  above  interventions  are  discussed
separately in the report, it is essential to consider
them as components of a package of measures. Such
‘packages’ are more likely to be publicly acceptable,
as they allow a mixture of policies, some of which
may be seen as dis advan tageous to individual users,
yet as a package they may be seen as supporting the
public good. To ensure successful implementation
of environ mental policies, some of which may involve
radical change, public acceptability should be a major
concern. Communities and other stakeholders should
thus be involved in all phases of policy devel op ment,
including  initial  discussions,  decision-making  and
implementation.

The strategic planning of the city, and the role
played by trans port systems, needs to be balanced
by  actions  taken  at  the  neigh bour hood  level,  in  a
supportive govern ment environ ment at all levels. It
is at the neigh bour hood level that cycling and walking
become important modes of trans port – for access
to employment and other services and facilities – and
these complement the need to travel longer distances
by public trans port to other parts of the city. City-
wide  decisions  need  to  take  account  of  the
requirements of the population and businesses – i.e.
to ensure access to destinations – so that movement
can take place in an efﬁcient and environ mentally
sus tain able manner.

To ensure
successful
implementation of
environmental
policies, . . .
public
acceptability
should be a major
concern

this indicates that devel op ing

alternatives to oil-based
transport, as these may have
lower levels of investment in
‘conventional’ trans port infra -
struc ture. This might be seen as
an opportunity for devel op ing
countries to make the transition
to a low-carbon trans port
system.

THE ECONOMICS AND FINANCING
OF URBAN MOBILITY

This chapter seeks to provide an understanding of
the economics and ﬁnan cial options that determine
the success or failure of urban mobility systems. Each
such system includes a range of mobility options, from
walking  to  rail-based  metro  systems.  In  economic
terms, the various modes of urban mobility are both
complementary and competitive. They are comple -
mentary because residents typically avail themselves
of more than one travel mode as they go about the
daily activities of urban life. At the same time these
modal alternatives often compete for passen gers. If
better-coordinated and sus tain able trans port systems
are to evolve out of such complex systems, it is going
to require an understanding of the incentives and
disincentives faced by buyers and sellers of trans port
services.

The ways that urban trans port options emerge
and evolve depend heavily upon the costs of these
options  and  the  ways  in  which  these  costs  are
ﬁnanced: either directly in fares, indirectly in taxes
and fees or absorbed as pollution, climate change,
congestion, road trafﬁc deaths and injuries, or other
social costs. Thus, this chapter reviews the economics
and ﬁnancing of urban mobility in light of its impacts
on the ways the choices are made to explicitly pay
for or implicitly absorb the costs.

In matters of urban trans port economics, ﬁnan -
cial  arrangements  are  always  paramount.  Finance
systems can encourage (or discourage) the alignment
of economic, environ mental and social goals. Differen -
tials  in  investments  and  operating  funds  among 
modal alternatives have social, spatial, environ mental
and equity impacts. These may be good or bad, as
the various modes compete for scarce urban space
and market shares. Whether by indecision or decision,
such  choices  are  made  continually,  and  thus  out -
comes in this regard are results of – and impact upon
– public policy.

To  understand  the  ﬁnan cial  dynamics,  it  is

necessary to understand the economic relationships
among  and  within  urban  travel  modes.  With  the
exception  of  rail-based  modes  (which  travel  on
segregated rights of way) all other forms of urban
movement – from walking to motorized travel – rely
on access to a shared system of sidewalks, streets,
roads and highways. Thus, while different modes of
urban movement appear to be physically and ﬁnan -
cially independent of one another, they are none -
theless  physically  and  ﬁnan cially  inter dependent
because of their shared (and usually competitive) use
of public infra struc ture.

The  improvement  of  urban  mobility  systems
requires strategic choices regarding the structures
through  which  the  infra struc ture  and  equipment
that  service  urban  public trans port are  ﬁnanced.
Public trans port must be bolstered as both a viable
alternative to private cars (and motorcycles) and a
strong supportive and complementary supplement to
non-motorized mobility. As a result, there is a need
to address the incentives and disincentives built into
current ﬁnan cial conﬁgurations.

In order to address the issues outlined above,
the ﬁrst section below presents a brief overview of
the  conditions  and  trends  that  determine  the
economics  of  urban  mobility.  This  is  followed  by
discussions on the economic role of trans port in the
functioning of an urban economy, and the need to
move  away  from  economics  of  mobility  towards
economics of access. The fourth section develops an
understanding  of  the  systems  of  incentives  and
disincentives built into the current methods used to
ﬁnance  urban  trans port systems.  Based  on  this
discussion,  the  ﬁfth  section  proposes  policies  and
plans that permit urban trans port to make a major
contribution to the realization of socially and environ -
mentally  sus tain able cities,  while  the  ﬁnal  section
contains some concluding remarks and lessons for
policy.

Planning and Design for Sustainable Urban Mobility

THE ECONOMIC AND
FINAN CIAL CHALLENGES
OF URBAN MOBILITY
This  section  discusses  the  key  economic  charac -
teristics of urban transport. It begins by examining
trends in private car ownership and use, since private
motorized trans port is the least environ mentally sus -
tain able, most land-intensive modal option. It then
compares user costs and the cost to build and operate
various urban trans port modes.

The global dominance of private
motorized transport
The  global  dominance  of  the  private  car  as  the
preferred means of urban trans port is setting global
urbanization on a collision course with the world’s
pressing  equity  and  environ mental concerns.1 As
indicated in Chapter 2, the forecasts for the future
in terms of non-motorized and public trans port are
not  promising,  if  current  car-ownership  trends
continue.2

Data on the relationship between rising income
levels and rising rates of car ownership are strongly
positive; as income rises, car ownership increases.
Within countries, wealthier residents are much more
likely to own motor vehicles. For example, modal split
is closely correlated with socioeconomic groups in
Bogotá (Colombia) and Santiago (Chile). Seventy per
cent of the high-income group in Bogotá and 80 per
cent in Santiago use private cars compared with 70
and 60 per cent of low-income groups using public
transportation, respectively.3

In China, with only 44 passen ger cars per 1000
people in 2010,4 estimates indicate that for every 1
per  cent  increase  in  average  disposable  income, 

car  ownership  in  Chinese  cities  is  expected  to
increase  by  1.8  per  cent.5 São  Paulo  is  another
example  of  the  trend;  bus  ridership  declined  by
nearly half (from 6.7 million to 3.8 million passen -
gers per day) during the 1990s. At the same time,
car  use  and  road  congestion  increased,  and  bus
speeds slowed from 19 to 12 kilometres per hour.6
Figure  8.1  illustrates  the  same  relationship
globally  by  comparing  per  capita  income  and  the
number of cars. Although the relationship between
income levels and car ownership is relatively weak
in countries with high incomes, it is strong among
low-income countries. As the majority of the world’s
population live in low-income countries, an overall
increase in income in these countries could have a
signiﬁcant impact on car ownership.7

These data convey an ironic message: as living
standards in devel op ing countries rise, their cities will
ﬁnd  themselves  under  ever-greater  pressure  to
accommodate private motorized transport, with all
its  other  negative  side  effects.  Where  economic
devel op ment  policies  are  successful8 economic
growth will stimulate demands to acquire valuable
land for use as roads and parking spaces. The simple
reason for this is that given the contemporary state
of urban public transport, private motorized trans -
port is  almost  universally  considered  to  be  the
superior alternative whenever people can afford the
choice.9 One result of this perception is the support
for trans port ﬁnance policies that privilege expanded
street and road networks to accommodate expanded
reliance  on  car-based  travel,  while  other  options
languish.

Thus,  from  an  economic  point  of  view,  the
central  challenge  is  to  ensure  that  ﬁnancing  for
public trans port and non-motorized trans port infra -
struc ture and service delivery is at least comparable
to efforts for accommodating the car. To do less is

to virtually ensure that public trans port remains an
inferior choice.

Economic characteristics by mode and
context
As noted in Chapter 2, non-freight transportation can
be divided into non-motorized trans port (walking and
bicycling), public transport, informal motorized trans -
port and private motorized transport. Each of these
modes has different economic characteristics, which
largely depend on contextual features, such as city
size and density, geography, demographics, institu -
tional framework and history.

In  many  cities,  there  is  a  wide  gap  between
modal  use,  infra struc ture  allocation  and  modal
funding. That is, a large share of the population uses
non-motorized or public transport, while a dispro -
portionate  amount  of  infra struc ture  and  funding
supports private motorized transport. For example,
in Dhaka, Bangladesh, almost 80 per cent of trips are
by walking, bus or informal motorized transport, yet
70 per cent of the road space is dedicated primarily
to private vehicles.10 In some Eastern African cities,
walking  accounts  for  more  than  half  of  all  trips 
but less than 1 per cent of total costs, while accom -
modating private vehicles incurs 50 per cent of total
system  costs.11 This  section  presents  an  overview
comparing the economics of the various modes in a
variety of contexts.

n Non-motorized transport
Non-motorized modes are highly cost effective as they
entail the lowest capital and operating costs, because
they  require  only  sidewalks  and  dedicated  street

lanes. They also cost the least for users who expend
only  calories  and  can  use  relatively  inexpensive
bicycles.  In  many  devel op ing  country  cities,  non-
motorized trans port is thus the predominant modal
choice.12

Despite its relatively low cost, infra struc ture for
non-motorized trans port (pedestrian bridges, paths,
sidewalks  and  crossings)  is  sorely  lacking  in  many
urban areas, making it a relatively unsafe and often
inconvenient  mode  of  travel.13 Financing  for  such
infra struc ture  is  usually  limited  to  central  govern-
ment funds, yet the historic nature of urban trans -
portation  policy  has  a  distinct  bias  towards  motor
vehicles. This has resulted in non-motorized trans -
port being  completely  ignored  or  allocated  an
insufﬁcient budget. This is a paradox, as most trips
contain at least one segment of walking.14 The main
factor related to the lack of ﬁnancing of non-motor -
ized  trans port facilities  in  cities  of  devel op ing
countries is that they are not ‘revenue generating’
and, hence, private investors and international lend -
ing agencies are not keen to provide ﬁnance, while
the cost is, in many cases, beyond city capabilities.15

n Public transport
In  general,  public  trans port can  provide  excellent
access within urban areas when it is affordable to
the user, frequent, predictable, safe and integrated
within a comprehensive network.16 However, public
trans port often entails high capital and operating costs
compared  with  private  cars,  although  it  is  consid -
erably more environ mentally sus tain able.17 To make
a comparison between the real cost of public versus
private motorized transport, it is essential that the
full  cost  include  social  costs,  local  pollution  and

Rail has the  highest  capital  costs of all public
trans port modes, irrespective of per capita national
incomes (Figure 8.2). While the capital costs range
widely, they are consistently higher than for other
modes.  It  has  been  estimated  that  the  total  per 
kilo metre  capital  cost  for  metros  generally  ranges
between US$50 million and US$150 million (2002
US$ values).18 BRT capital costs (i.e. stations and dedi -
cated lanes) are considerably lower and the systems
are  built  faster  than  rail.  A  US  study  (from  2001)
found  the  average  capital  cost  per  kilometre  of 
BRT lines to be about US$8.4 million, compared to
US$21.6 million for light rail.19 Similarly, in India,
the ﬁrst phase of the BRT system in Ahmedabad cost
only 5 per cent of the capital cost of the Delhi Metro
(US$1.4 million and US$30 million per kilometre,
respectively).20 A major reason for the high cost of
metro construction is related to tunnel excavation.
Construction  of  each  kilometre  of  metro  under-
ground  lines  has  been  estimated  to  be  between 
four and six times more costly than for lines above
the  ground.21 However,  BRT  does  generally  entail 
higher  maintenance  and  operation  costs  than  rail
(Figure 8.3).

Public  trans port  is  primarily  ﬁnanced  through
fares,  subsidies  and  value-capture  arrangements.
Fares are perhaps the most contested component
of public trans port ﬁnancing. Cost recovery from fares
ranges widely (Box 8.1). In many cases, fares are not
affordable to large segments of the population. Box
8.3 shows that fares and other trans port costs can
comprise a sizable share of income for low-income

and poor populations.22 When fares increase, riders
may protest, and ridership may decline to the effect
of precluding any revenue increases – as in Ouaga -
dougou (Burkina Faso) in 2004 and Lomé (Togo) in
2009.23

Thus,  international  aid  and/or  broader-based
subsidies must be sought to support public trans -
port systems.24 These range from taxes on individuals
and employers, to industry and sales. Public trans -
port  can  also  be  supported  by  tolls  collected  on
bridges  and  tunnels  in  the  adjoining  metropolitan
region.25 In  London  (UK),  public  trans port is  sup -
ported in part by congestion charges paid by drivers
of  private  cars  entering  into  the  central  business
district.  Subsidies  may  also  be  tied  to  real  estate
transactions (as in New York, US).26 In general, the
mix of public trans port subsidies should produce a
stream of revenue that is steady and reliable over
time,  and  not  subject  to  political  and  economic
shifts. Strong regulatory and governing institutions
are  necessary  to  collect  and  distribute  funds  for
public trans port at a large scale.

In recent years, ‘value capture’, the practice
of  linking  fees  and  taxes  on  the  indirect  but  real
beneﬁciaries of trans port access, has emerged as an
attractive  political  approach  to  the  challenge  of
creating  sus tain able revenue  sources  for  public
transport.27 It is typically presented as a third method
of ﬁnance, though the congestion charges and real
estate transaction fees described above could fairly
be interpreted as forms of value capture. The most
frequently  cited  contemporary  example  of  value
capture  is  the  system  of  sus tain able ﬁnance  that
supports  public  transportation  in  Hong  Kong  (Box

Box 8.1 Public trans port cost recovery from fares

In general, the situations where fare-box recovery is adequate
to support the public trans port system are in places where
density of use is high, public trans port runs on exclusive rights
of way and where afﬂuent users prefer public trans port to
private cars. Two types of situation ﬁt this scenario:

• Certain Asian cities such as Hong Kong,a Singapore,b

Tokyoc and Osakac and Taipei.d The fare-box recovery
ratio in Hong Kong in 2007 was 149 per cent.a

• High-speed rail lines that connect major airports to city
centres, such as the Heathrow Express in London (UK);
the Arlanda Express in Stockholm (Sweden); the Brussels
Airport Train (Belgium); Schipol–Amsterdam train (the
Netherlands) and the Shanghai Maglev (China).e

For cities in Europe the modal fare-box recovery ratios are in
the range 30–50 per cent. The fare-box recovery ratios in
North American cities with high density and strong ﬁxed rail
systems are comparable to those in Europe. However, in the
lower density North American cities the rates go down to as
little as 9 per cent.d In Burkina Faso, the public-private bus
system, SOTRACO, covers 59 per cent of operating costs
from fare revenues.f

8.7). The policy notion of value capture in Hong Kong
is to ensure that all or a portion of the value created
and embedded in the location value of land parcels
that is attributable to trans port is directed towards
investment in trans port infra struc ture or operation.28
Public–private partnership29 concessions have
met  with  limited  success  in  public  transportation
projects  (see,  for  example,  the  experi ence  of  the
London Underground,30 New Delhi’s failed privatiza -
tion of buses in the early 1990s, and similar failures
in Pakistan).31

n Informal motorized transport
Informal  motorized  trans port (mini buses,  shared
taxis, motorbike taxis, etc.) can operate much like
public trans port from the user’s perspective, but is
usually managed by private, for-proﬁt companies or
individuals.  Each  informal  trans port system  may 
have its own fare structure that is not integrated with
the rest of the public trans port system. And, as men -
tioned in Chapter 6, in Tanzania (and several other
countries), informal trans port buses refuse to provide
rides to free-fare students.32

Fare  regimes  within  the  informal  trans port
system  often  vary  by  market  segments  and  the
perceived price sensitivities of customers. A study
of Malaysia’s trishaw industry for example found that
different  fare  structures  were  charged  to  regular
customers (lowest), casual customers, goods, prosti -
tute runs, tourists (highest).33 Differentiated pricing
is also seen as weather or road conditions change.
For instance, in Nairobi, Kenya, fares are often in -
creased during heavy rains, as is the case in much of
South-Eastern Asia during the monsoon season.34

Informal motorized trans port uses collectively
provided infra struc ture, namely roads. They usually
do  not  have  built  stations  but  avail  themselves  of
roadside stops that often cause other trafﬁc to be
delayed and backed up. Their capital costs are thus

relatively  low,  while  operating  costs  are  kept  low
through  low  wages  and  minimal  administration.
Motorcycle taxis are even less expensive to operate
than mini buses, since fuel and repairs cost less. Due
to  these  implicit  subsidies,  lack  of  administrative
overhead and freedom from regulations (that might
forestall safety and environ mental problems), informal
motorized trans port is able to earn a proﬁt from rider
fares although proﬁt margins may be low.35

Situations such as these illustrate the ways in
which  uncompensated  social  costs  subsidize  the
ﬁnan cial viability for informal sector trans port pro -
viders. Legally collecting fees and taxes from informal
trans port modes has proven to be bureaucratically
difﬁcult,  as  in  Cotonou,  Benin,36 although  police
and other ofﬁcials are known to regularly extort fees
from  informal  trans port operators.  Many  cities  in
devel op ing countries struggle with formalizing the
informal  public  transportation  sector  to  improve
service and safety.

n Private motorized transport
Private  motorized  transport,  including  cars  and
motorcycles, is often the most expensive mode for
the traveller. As shown in the previous section, the
use  of  private  cars  increases  with  income.  Private
vehicle use ranges from 7 per cent of residents of
Addis Ababa37 (Ethiopia) to 87.9 per cent of work
trips in the US.38 Travellers must purchase or lease
a vehicle, buy insurance and registration, pay tolls
and charges, buy fuel and maintain the vehicle.

Finally,  there  is  a  choke  point  of  congestion
when each private vehicle reduces space and dimin -
ishes the quality and speed of the trip for all other
vehicles.  Depending  on  system  design,  private
vehicles  can  also  interfere  with  the  operation  of
public transportation. The cost of congestion is how -
ever difﬁcult to measure.39

ECONOMIC VALUE OF THE
TRANS PORT SECTOR
Urban transportation is a vital urban public service
and an integral input into the economic life of its
city-region. While the overall size of the trans port
sector  varies  from  economy  to  economy  it  tends 
to account for a small but signiﬁcant proportion of
GDP. In the US, for example, trans port accounted
for about 8.5 per cent of the GDP in 2009,40 com -
pared to between 3 and 8 per cent in the countries
of Asia and the Paciﬁc.41

The demand for trans port is what economists
call a derived demand: a demand generated in pursuit
of another goal. Transportation of people and goods
is rarely undertaken as an end in itself.

The direct and indirect contribution of trans port
spending  to  overall  productivity  and  employment
creation is valuable. Thus, it is important to create
trans port systems that are as efﬁcient and effective
as  possible  in  terms  of  both  their  monetary  and
social costs. In Houston (US) where over 70 per cent
of commuting is done by private cars, the costs of
urban  trans port absorb  14  per  cent  of  GDP.  The
comparable  proportion  for  New  York  City  (US),
where over 50 per cent of commuting is done by

public transport, is about one-third less of regional
GDP or about 9.4 per cent.42

In addition to being a major factor of production
and urban consumption, urban trans port is a major
source  of  employment.  It  has  been  conservatively
estimated that in 2009 the formal public trans port
sector  accounted  for  about  13  million  full-time
equivalent  jobs  (as  trans port  operators)  world-
wide.43 Of these jobs, some 7.3 million represent
direct  employment  by  public  trans port operators
(Table 8.1). The rest are employed directly by public
author ities  (300,000  people)  or  involved  in  the
provision of goods and services to public trans port
operators and authorities44 (5 million people). Public
trans port  operators  are  the  largest  employers  in
Amsterdam  (the  Netherlands),  Barcelona  (Spain),
Brussels (Belgium), Genoa (Italy) and Dublin (Ireland).
In Paris (France), Budapest (Hungary), Porto (Portu -
gal),  Madrid  (Spain),  Turin  (Italy)  and  Tallinn
(Estonia), public trans port operators rank among the
city’s top-ﬁve employers.45

However, in many devel op ing countries trans -
port  is  primarily  characterized  by  informal  sector
employment.46 In most cities of Sub-Saharan Africa,
employment in the informal urban trans port industry
is a mainstay of the local urban economy. In Kenya,
some  40,000  matatus (minivans)  provide  80,000
direct  and  80,000  indirect  jobs,  mostly  in  urban
areas.47 In South Africa, the ‘Kombi taxi’ (the urban
minivans) created approximately 185,000 direct jobs
and 150,000 indirect jobs in 2003. In Kampala, it 
is estimated that the informal minivan industry em-
ploys between 40,000 and 60,000 people.48 These
numbers are suggestive of the high importance of
informal trans port sector employment in many devel -
op ing countries.

The trans port sector also often creates higher
overall levels of income. In Geneva, it is estimated
that  for  every  US$1  invested,  another  US$3.8  of
value  added  is  created.49 Worldwide,  it  has  been
estimated that every US$1 of value created by public
trans port is linked to the further value creation of
US$4. In addition, ‘every direct job in public trans -
port is  linked  to  four  jobs  in  other  sectors  of  the
economy’.50 Similar multipliers are observed in the
US with more than 36,000 jobs created for every
US$1 billion invested in public transport.51

Transportation is a service produced through the
creation  of  networked  infra struc ture,  sidewalks,
streets, roads, highways and railways. The process
of  producing  this  infra struc ture  is  thus  both  a
contribution  to  present  employment  and  future
productivity. It has been estimated that some US$7.8
trillion  will  be  spent  on  trans port  infra struc ture
projects globally between 2005 and 2030 (Table 8.2).
Although  all  trans port  investments  are  creating
employment,  it  is  worth  noting  that  the  creation 
of public trans port infra struc ture in the US appears
to  have  almost  twice  as  much  job  stimulus  as  a

comparable  amount  spent  on  highway  infra struc -
ture.52 What is perhaps most striking about the data
in this table is that the regions with the lowest pro -
jected infra struc ture investments are the ones that
are  likely  to  experi ence  the  most  severe  urban
mobility challenges, due to rapid urbanization.53 The
two regions with the lowest projected investments
for example (i.e. Africa and the Middle East), are likely
to more than double their urban populations between
2005 and 2030, compared to an increase of only 16
per cent in developed countries.54

The costs associated with road trafﬁc accidents
are  often  overlooked  in  the  context  of  trans port
economics  but  should  always  be  accounted  for  in
policy-making.55 The total annual cost of road trafﬁc
accidents has been estimated at US$518 billion, or
about 1–3 per cent of global GDP.56

FROM ECONOMICS OF
MOBILITY TOWARDS
ECONOMICS OF ACCESS
One  of  the  most  powerful  justiﬁcations  for  the
disproportionate funding of private motorized trans -
port is that it saves time. This in turn leads to the
evolution of urban trans port policies that promote
extensive reliance on ever more mobility to solve the
urban  congestion  and  access  problems.  However, 
in the context of urban living, mobility is just one of
two  means  for  achieving  access.  As  noted  earlier 
in this report, access can also be achieved through
co-location of urban activities. As a practical challenge
of policy-making, the attraction of enhanced mobility
is that it is easy to measure and hence to value, while
co-location – or mixed-use urban land arrangements
–  is  difﬁcult  to  monetize.  This  methodological
constraint has skewed cost–beneﬁt analyses to favour
mobility-oriented infra struc ture projects over ones
that might enhance co-location.

This section shows how (and why) the value of
mobility over access leads to the promotion of private
motorized trans port over more sus tain able modes,
and revisits the framing of cost–beneﬁt approaches
to trans port project evaluation.

What has time saving got to do with it?
As a result of the problems in measuring the ben-
eﬁts of co-location, much of the treatment of urban
trans port as an economic good focuses on its mobility
value, usually measured as travel time saved.57 The
presumption behind this is that if mobility promotes
access, measuring the value of time saved in travel
is a good proximate measure for the ultimate end
product, i.e. more time in other pursuits.

Because  time  spent  in  motion  (i.e.  mobility) 
is  such  a  relatively  straightforward  concept  to
understand and to measure, it provides a powerful

basis for valuing trans port improvements. If the value
of the beneﬁts exceeds the cost of the project, it is
deemed  worthwhile.  It  is  from  this  insight  that
modern cost–beneﬁt analysis for trans port decision-
making evolved.58

Cost–beneﬁt  analysis  is  now  the  primary  tool
through which govern ments, international ﬁnan cial
institutions and bilateral donors make decisions on
major  public  works  projects.  Its  elements  have
become  so  standardized  that  few  question  the
shortcomings of using enhanced mobility as a proxy
for urban access. But at a time when the economic
and environ mental costs of mobility are becoming
difﬁcult  to  sustain,  it  is  important  to  rethink  this
approach.

A  recent  look  at  a  cross-section  of  trans port
cost–beneﬁt analyses across the UK concluded that
approximately 80 per cent of the identiﬁed beneﬁts
in trans port derive from the monetary value assigned
to time savings. However, the amount of time spent
in  urban  travel  in  the  UK  has  remained  constant 
at around one hour per day for three decades. Travel
diary studies demonstrate that the beneﬁt of trans -
port improvements provide a greater range of spatial
access  within  the  same  travel  time  budget  over
time.59 If this is the case, there is a need to better
assess ‘the value of access’ as distinct from the hypo -
thesized beneﬁt of ‘time saved’ in considering trans -
port investments.

Measuring the value of access
To the extent that trans port improves the ability of
an urban area to maximize the agglomerative beneﬁts
of access – i.e. the economies of market density and
supplier density – it adds signiﬁcant value to the local
economy.  A  working  deﬁnition  of  the  beneﬁts  of
agglomeration would be the increase in individual per
worker  productivity  that  results  from  improved
access. A recent study of London’s Crossrail project
(Box 8.2) uses such calculation methods on a large-
scale  public  trans port project,  in  order  to  capture
access beneﬁts along with travel-time saving beneﬁts.
Adding  these  agglomerative  beneﬁts  to  the  more
traditional time-cost savings beneﬁts raised the tra -
ditional time savings based beneﬁt–cost ratio between
36 and 93 per cent. While the method ologies used
to measure these effects can be debated – and have
led to considerable discussion – the important point
is that these estimates provide an empirical sense of
the sizable beneﬁts that access conveys. Most import -
ant for matters of economic sus tain ability, they open
up the possibility that access and hence economic
wellbeing can be improved upon via the co-locational
characteristics of places. This includes more reliance
on  pedestrian  and  bicycle  access,  as  well  as  more 
and better public trans port options, both of which
are  critical  to  an  economics  of  sus tain able urban
transport.

Box 8.2 Crossrail and agglomeration beneﬁts, London, UK

Crossrail is a new addition to the London Underground, which
is scheduled to start operations in 2018. It is intended to
increase carrying capacity by 10 per cent in the portion of the
system serving central London. Using conventional analysis,
Crossrail yielded a strong traditional beneﬁt–cost ratio of 2.55.
Fifty-four per cent of the beneﬁt takes the form of travel-time
saving and 43 per cent from increased network carrying
capacity.

By including the wider economic beneﬁts of

agglomeration, a second beneﬁt–cost ratio was calculated. In
the latter instance the ratio increases to between 3.47 and
4.91. About one-third of this increased beneﬁt is due to higher

worker productivity, due to the higher levels of urbanization
and localization economies created by improved access. The
remainder of the added beneﬁt is linked to increased tax
revenue generated from the transformation of less productive
to more productive jobs plus the improved locational value of
the areas served and increased labour force participation.

Comparing the initial beneﬁt–cost ratio with the

beneﬁt–cost ratios that include the wider economic beneﬁts of
access and agglomeration, the ratio increases between 36 per
cent (at a beneﬁt–cost ratio of 3.47) and 93 per cent (at a
beneﬁt–cost ratio of 4.91).

Urban mobility is both a private and a
public good
An economic analysis of sus tain able urban mobility
must consider the complex nature of mobility as an
economic good. Mobility as a commodity lends itself
to the standard economics of supply and demand, as
it is conceivable in the context of private markets
where buyers and sellers agree upon quantities and
prices. Even the presence of ‘externalities’ is cor rect -
able  via  disincentives,  such  as  taxes  on  negative
externalities  (like  air  pollution)  and  congestion
charging  and  parking  fees  (Box  8.5)  to  discourage
excessive car use and incentives for positive external -
ities,  such  as  access  to  ‘free’  bicycles  and  well-
designed and walkable streets.

In the language of economics, mobility has the
two distinguishing characteristics of a private good,
rivalry in consumption and excludability in ownership.
Rivalry refers to the notion that what one individual
consumes  cannot  also  be  consumed  by  another. 
If one individual buys a ticket to a certain seat on a
train, a second individual cannot occupy the same
seat for the same trip. Excludability means that the
owners of the vehicle can deny entry to those not
purchasing a ticket to ride.

While the case for mobility as a private good is
powerful, the case for the access that it creates as a
public good is more compelling, and for the same
reasons. Turning the two characteristics of a private
good  around  implies  a  public  good:  non-rivalry  in
consumption  and  non-excludability  in  ownership.
Access is characterized by both non-rivalry and non-
excludability. When one person accesses the city by
working or living there, she does not harm another’s
ability to access the city. In fact, she increases the
value of another person accessing the city. Although
one  can  conceive  of  exceptions,  access  to  a  city’s
opportunities  is  likewise  non-excludable,  because
there is no entry fee to a city. The mobility option
one must use to get there, however, may be charac -
terized by both rivalry and excludability, depending

on congestion and fares. This means that the standard
economic analysis of supply and demand, based as
it is on the presumption of private goods, is a limited
tool for establishing useful ﬁnan cial models to support
urban mobility.

The working formulation for an economics of
sus tain able urban  mobility  is  one  in  which  the
planning and policy target is maximum access and
minimal  mobility.  An  ideal  sus tain able city  is  one
where the need to expend resources in movement
of people and goods is at the lowest possible level.
The co-locational properties of the city – the oppor -
tunities  for  specialization  and  innovation  made
possible by the density and diversity of people and
ﬁrms – are the desired social good. Mobility serves
as the means to access these goods. The economic
sus tain ability  of  urban  mobility  relates  the  value
created by trans port in enhancing accessibility even
as it minimizes the environ mental and social costs
of mobility. Thus, as physical realities, cities are the
co-location of activities to avoid the need to travel.60

Road pricing is necessary but normally
not sufﬁcient to improve urban
accessibility
There  is  considerable  evidence  that  car  users  in
most countries do not pay a high enough price to
cover the full cost to society of this travel mode.61
In practical terms, this implies that the society at large
is in effect subsidizing private motorized trans port
(through the costs of addressing economic, social and
environ mental externalities). From the point of view
of  conventional  microeconomics,  the  standard
diagnosis is that the market for urban car travel is
inefﬁcient.  The  policy  solutions  to  correct  that
inefﬁciency call for ‘getting prices right’.

The  policy  recommendations  that  ﬂow  from
‘right’  pricing  are  the  creation  of  methods  to
effectively raise the cost of car usage to better reﬂect
the environ mental and social costs that this travel
mode imposes on society. ‘Full cost pricing’, as this

approach is known, seeks to impose licenses and fees
via taxes on drivers that approximate the economic
value  of  the  social  and  environ mental costs.  An
example of this can be seen in Singapore where the
govern ment has implemented a number of ﬁnan cial
disincentives to curb car ownership,62 and encourage
a modal shift to non-motorized and public transport.
However, even if this policy worked as predicted,
it  is  at  best  a  partial  solution,  as  the  goal  of  such
pricing  is  to  decrease  the  use  of  cars.  Unless  the
revenues raised are sufﬁcient to cover the costs of
added public trans port to provide substitute service,
such pricing is at best a necessary and not a sufﬁcient
condition in terms of meeting the access needs of a
city-region. Further more, such a policy has signiﬁcant
risks  in  terms  of  social  equity.  The  drivers  that  it
prices out of the market will be the ones with the
least ability to pay the higher costs. Moreover, it does
nothing to meet the ongoing needs of the large mass
of lower-income residents who were not driving in
the ﬁrst place. Thus, policies are also required that
directly  address  the  underlying  reasons  for  urban
travel, and that address the problems of those for
whom, even at comparatively low market prices, car
travel is out of reach.63

The private car versus public transport:
Markets and modal choices
If one considers the data presented in Figure 8.1 and
nothing else, it is easy to conclude that there is strong
universal urban desire for car-based travel. If that is
the wish of the world’s urban population, shouldn’t
policy and planning goals aim to satisfy this market
demand in a manner that is as environ mentally sound
and socially equitable as possible? It is difﬁcult to
argue with that policy interpretation given the globally
poor state of public trans port alternatives.

The  problem  with  this  view  is  technological
reality. The idealized promise of the car can only be
achieved  in  cities  if  certain  unlikely  technological
changes are made: if vehicles cost little to own and
maintain, use little energy, do not pollute and emit
greenhouse  gases,  and  lack  the  physical  need  for
expanded  road  space  and  parking  places.  Lacking
these conditions, pressing social and environ mental
concerns  will  continue  to  render  the  dream  of
personal freedom of mobility as theoretical fantasy
– or as an unrelenting urban nightmare – if attempted
in practice.

As the evidence presented in this report makes
exceedingly  clear,  there  are  public  trans port
alternatives – as well as pedestrian and other non-
motorized forms of travel – that can make a scalable
difference  in  terms  of  both  personal  mobility  and
urban sus tain ability. The experi ences in some Asian
and  European  cities  –  where  public  trans port trip
speeds exceed those of private cars – exemplify the
potential of enhanced public transport.64 In light of

The Economics and Financing of Urban Mobility

this, a more realistic interpretation of Figure 8.1 is
that it reﬂects things as they are: a less than ideal
choice between an often unreliable and unsafe public
system and being stuck in slow-moving trafﬁc in a
car-based system.

However, it is public ﬁnance, and not private
market  decisions,  that  is  the  ﬁnal  arbiter  of  the
quantity and quality of the urban trans port options.
The reason that public ﬁnance becomes the crucial
determinant  of  the  choices  that  deﬁne  private
markets is that once one moves beyond walking and
other forms of non-motorized transport, motorized
trans port modes are never fully supported by charges
to travellers. Motorized trans port requires funding
beyond what users pay directly, as discussed in the
section  below.  In  order  to  develop urban  public
trans port systems that are of sufﬁcient quality and
quantity,  and  that  also  reduce  environ mental and
social equity problems, policy-makers must confront
the reality that user charges will never be sufﬁcient.

THE PERENNIAL FINAN CIAL
PROBLEM: COSTS EXCEED
REVENUES
The continual ﬁscal challenge for any urban public
trans port supplier is avoiding a negative cash ﬂow:
attaining either a zero balance between income and
expenditure, or a positive cash ﬂow to ﬁnance future
improvements. This requires bridging the difference
between fare revenues and the full costs of service
while encouraging efﬁcient operations in a manner
that is sus tain able over time. This challenge is not
easy nor are the solutions free of controversy. This
section  explores  the  dimensions  of  this  chronic
funding  gap.  The  next  section  explores  potential
solutions.

User charges are never sufﬁcient to
ﬁnance public transport
There is no obvious theoretical reason that prevents
urban public trans port from covering its full costs via
charges on its users. But in practice, as noted in Box
8.1, there are only a handful of instances where fares
represent both full cost recovery and sufﬁcient proﬁt
to permit a private market to sus tain ably meet the
needs of passen ger travel.65 The experi ence in some
transitional countries, such as Poland, in the early
1990s captures the essence of the problem:

‘. . . cost recovery in major cities appeared to be
too low to generate sufﬁcient funds for replacing
and modernizing bus and tram ﬂeets. It led to
worsening of the quality of public trans port and
was another reason . . . for undesirable modal
shifts.’66

162

Planning and Design for Sustainable Urban Mobility

Urban transport,
because it
facilitates access,
is fundamentally a
public good

The value of
urban transport is
directly related to
its quality as an
integrated system,
distinct from a
collection of
independent
modal options and
speciﬁc routes

This  experi ence  highlights  the  two  ways  that
policy-makers have attempted to ‘solve’ the cash-ﬂow
problem: fare increases and competitive tendering.
These  solutions  typically  fall  short  because  policy-
makers are often not clear about their policy goals.
Is urban trans port a private good with some public
beneﬁts or is it a public good with private beneﬁts?
Depending  on  how  one  chooses  to  answer  that
question, the policy outcomes are very different. This
report is built around the clear premise that urban
transport,  because  it  facilitates  access,  is  funda -
mentally a public good. The policy goal is to streng -
then the use of public (and non-motorized) transport.
Its private good’s features can be leveraged to provide
some of the needed revenue, but that, by itself, will
not be adequate.

If public trans port is viewed solely as a means
of private conveyance to satisfy private demands, it
has a higher chance of success, but such success has
a price. The trans port system either does not operate
at sufﬁcient volume to positively impact urban spatial
patterns in a sus tain able or equitable manner, or –
if the volume is adequate – the quality is exceedingly
low and everyone who can avoid it does. Rising rates
of car ownership and car use for work and education
trips are the result. The starting point for confronting
the ﬁnan cial challenge is to recognize that if urban
public  trans port is  to  generate  its  valuable  public
goods  beneﬁts  (i.e.  to  promote  access),  revenue
sources beyond the fare box are needed.

No matter how hard policy-makers and ofﬁcials
try to make public trans port self-supporting through
the  fare  box  and  reorganizational  moves,  such  as
competitive tendering to improve efﬁciency, these
reforms always fall short. It is not that fare policy and
organizational form are unimportant; on the contrary,
they are exceedingly important. By themselves these
second-order conditions are not sufﬁcient if accessi -
bility is the policy goal. The policy challenge is to
broaden  both  the  sus tain able mass  usage  of  the
service  and  encourage  revenue  sources  that  go
beyond the fare box. The goal is to create viable ﬁnan -
cial models that align organizational forms for service
delivery  with  the  unique  trans port  needs  of  each
metropolitan area.

The high private cost of transport
As discussed above,67 the problem on the consumer
side  is  that  while  travellers  in  devel op ing  coun-
tries  do  pay  high  trans port  prices  relative  to  their
income, the amount paid is insufﬁcient relative to
the  revenue  sums  required  at  full  cost  recovery.
Trans portation costs for urban and low-income popu -
lations are always high, measured either in terms of
money or time (Box 8.3). In developed coun tries, the
costs  tend  to  be  in  money  terms.  In  devel op ing
countries, people tend to spend more hours of the
day in moving from place to place.

Poor-quality  transportation  entails  high  costs
that are often not distributed equally across the city
or  within  households.  For  example,  women  may
become  stranded  as  they  attempt  to  link  trips  for
childcare and employment; the elderly may reduce
the number of trips they make; and children may have
dangerous or tedious trips to school. Only counting
the  monetary  expenditure  of  travel,  measured  in
terms of personal or household incomes, these costs
can account for anywhere from one-tenth to one-ﬁfth
of  income  for  high-income  individuals  and  house -
holds. For the poor, it can account for nearly half of
their income.

These  income  constraints  limit  the  amount 
of revenue that users can contribute to the costs of
maintaining the urban trans port system. This problem
is especially acute in devel op ing countries. Attempts
to resolve revenue shortfalls by increasing the costs
to  populations  that  are  already  paying  a  fare  that
severely  taxes  their  ability  to  pay  is  clearly  an
extremely  inequitable  approach,  and  is  thus  not
likely to succeed.

Good quality urban transport: The
system is the solution
The value of urban trans port is directly related to 
its quality as an integrated system, distinct from a
collection of independent modal options and speciﬁc
routes. The more options that urban residents have
to access work, education, shopping, social connec -

Studies from Nairobi (Kenya), Lagos (Nigeria) and South Africa
show that lower-income households pay from 15 to 54 per
cent of their income in transportation costs. Public
transportation fares are high and poorly regulated. In Lagos,
for example, bus drivers often force riders to exit and re-
board paying an additional fare to continue their trip. Riders
must often bargain with drivers for the price of the fare. For
the poor, high trans port costs diminish their access to basic
needs. It erodes the efﬁciency of individual economic activities
as well as reducing national and municipal economic efﬁciency.

Further more, a 1990 study of four Eastern African cities
showed that non-motorized trans port – walking and cycling –
was inadequately accommodated. Walking meets up to half the
trans port demand and accounts for only 1 per cent of the total
trans port costs. In contrast, private motorized trans port
meets less than 10 per cent of demand, yet accounts for over
half the costs.

The ﬁnan cial danger is that in a quest for saving
money,  speciﬁc  routes  are  at  times  valued  on  an
individual basis and not as part of a system. Individual
routes  can  at  times  cover  operating  costs  and
occasionally some or all of their capital cost when
travel demand is sufﬁciently intense. This typically
occurs along major public trans port routes serving
the highest density portions of urban central business
districts.  Singapore  and  Hong  Kong  are  the  best
examples of this. However, the public goods value
of access derives from the existence of entire urban
trans port systems and not just travel on its densest
routes.69 Less-dense  routes  that  make  the  entire
system viable often cost more to operate than the
revenue  from  fares  can  cover.  But  without  these
feeders, the diversity of opportunities that contribute
to the creation of urban value would be lost. The
greater  the  degree  of  system  integration  within 
and across modes, the higher the degree of valuable
access the system creates. To achieve that valuable
goal requires public-led investments in infra struc ture,
equipment and service delivery.

EXPANDING THE 
FINAN CIAL OPTIONS 
FOR PUBLIC AND NON-
MOTORIZED TRANSPORT
In what direction should the public sector proceed
in order to expand ﬁnan cial support for urban public
and non-motorized trans port beyond user-generated
revenues?  This  section  examines  four  possible
approaches  (as  well  as  combinations  of  these),
namely:

• Direct  allocations  from  general  municipal  and

national revenues (i.e. from general taxations);

• Other allocations from govern ment sources;
• Finan cial arrangements that allow the trans port
system to capture a portion of the value that they
create through urban access (i.e. value capture);
• Other  arrangements  that  allow  public–private
partnerships to capture the value created by trans -
port systems.70

General revenue models
The most common way in which govern ments meet
the funding gap for urban trans port is via allocations
from general tax receipts. It reﬂects a general belief
in the public goods value that the service creates.
To the extent that govern ments treat public trans -
port as just one among many public services such as
police protection and education, this arrangement can
work well. This approach is widespread in China, for
example. Urban trans port there is typically supported

The Economics and Financing of Urban Mobility

through general revenue allocations from the local
municipal govern ment, with rail-based more favoured
than bus-based. In Shanghai, as part of its accom -
modation of World Expo, the govern ment allocated
an  additional  US$541  million71 to  ensure  smooth
operations in 2009.72

In  virtually  every  city  there  are  some  general
revenues used to support the urban trans port system
in one way or another. In Curitiba, Brazil, the fares
on the BRT system cover the operating costs for the
private  companies  that  supply  services,  including
reduced  and  free  tickets  for  some  categories  of
riders.  Nonetheless,  the  user-generated  revenue
does not cover all of the infra struc ture costs. The
munici pality  supports  the  construction  and  main -
tenance of the street-based exclusive rights of way
on  which  the  system  operates  from  its  general
revenue sources.73

One of the weaknesses of general revenue as a
ﬁnan cial source is its political vulnerability. In cities
where public trans port is viewed as a largely private
good, any forms of public support are often looked
upon as temporary and easily dispensed with in the
belief that the ﬁscal problems are the self-inﬂicted
wounds of an incompetent industry. This is especially
the case in austere ﬁscal times (such as the current
global ﬁnan cial crisis), when politicians can adopt this
rationale as they search for a politically easy place to
cut public spending. These losses of support always
cause cuts in services and higher fares, just when
more people need mobility to ﬁnd work and have less
money to spend on it.

Another  form  of  political  vulnerability  that 
should be mentioned here is that related to changes
in political leadership at the city and national level.
This applies not only to changing political directions
related  to  the  rise  and  fall  of  support  for  speciﬁc
political parties, but also to the departure of indi -
viduals that may have championed speciﬁc initiatives
in the trans port sector.

Figure 8.4 provides an overview of sources of
operating  revenue  for  public  trans port in  ﬁve
developed country cities. The ﬁgure indicates that
three of the public trans port operators – TriMet in
Portland  (US),  Translink  in  Vancouver  (Canada) 
and  Sytral  in  Lyon  (France)  –  collect  more  than
three-quarters of their operating revenues from either
fares or dedicated tax revenues (over which they exert
some  degree  of  control).  Operators  that  rely  on
direct  funding  from  local,  provincial  or  national
govern ments  for  their  revenue  streams  may  more
easily be subject to the negative effects of changing
political climates.

Ideally,  funding  for  non-motorized  trans port
should  come  from  normal  operative  budgets  from
departments dealing with transportation and public
works.74 However, funding for such infra struc ture
investments could also be drawn from revenues from
advertising,  road  pricing/taxes  and  private-sector

include funding options to enable the poorest urban
residents to purchase bicycles.

Other allocations of public funds
Given  the  limitations  of  public  funds  to  ﬁnance
public transport, many govern ments have also appro -

Box 8.4 Urban road pricing initiatives

The primary objective of most urban road pricing initiatives is
to reduce congestion levels during periods of peak travel
demand. However, such initiatives may have additional goals,
such as generating revenue, reducing environ mental impacts
and encouraging public trans port use. When ﬁnancing is the
main purpose of road pricing, the aim is to design a system
that provides steady and reliable revenues. Quite often the
purpose may be to ﬁnance the cost of new infra struc ture, for
example a new road or bridge. The manner in which these
revenues are used is often the key to obtaining public
acceptance for the scheme – even if the primary goal is
congestion management. An overview of different types of
road pricing initiatives is included in Figure 8.5.

The ﬁrst modern road pricing system in the world was
implemented in Singapore in 1975. The purpose of the system
is to regulate trafﬁc, by achieving a target speed that gives
improved accessibility. Every three months the fees are revised
upward or downward, based on whether the travel speeds are
above or below the desired speed. In 2001, the project
sponsors introduced an environ mental component to the
scheme by charging a reduced fee for electric or hybrid cars.

Oslo, Norway, introduced an electronic road toll system
in 1990, with 19 tolling stations that control access to the city
24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Emphasis was placed on the
generation of revenues necessary to ﬁnance new road and
public trans port projects. As a result, the trafﬁc impacts of the
toll system itself have been minimal, with only a 3–4 per cent

reduction in trafﬁc. The annual operating costs of the toll
system account for approximately 10 per cent of annual
revenues, while the remainder is used to support road and
public trans port investments.

Other systems have since been introduced in a number

of cities around the world. In devel op ing countries where
trafﬁc levels are low, or where construction costs are high, it
is unlikely that the tolls will cover more than operation and
maintenance, and perhaps a part of the construction cost. In
Mexico, for example, the main reasons for the failure of road
concession projects have been attributed to: lower than
expected revenues due to trafﬁc shortfalls; excessively high
toll rates; and the currency crisis of 1994.

Even though urban road pricing initiatives are designed
to generate socially desired beneﬁts, experi ence shows that
there are major obstacles encountered during the planning
phases related to public acceptance, equity, politics,
economics, technology and the design of the pricing scheme. 
In the 1980s, the city of Hong Kong considered the
introduction of an electronic congestion scheme. The public
response, however, was unfavourable, as there were signiﬁcant
privacy concerns about the govern ment’s ability to track users’
movements and identities, and the initiative failed.

availability of urban transportation services. Examples
of such funding (which are in effect cross-subsidies
to  public  and  non-motorized  transport75)  include,
inter alia: various forms of road pricing (Box 8.4 and
Figure  8.5);  parking  fees  (Box  8.5);  advertising; 
sales  taxes  (Box  8.12);  taxes  on  fuels  and  vehicle

employers within the urban area (Box 8.6) on the
rationale that they beneﬁt from increased productivity
as a result of employees and customers having better
access  to  work  and  commercial  locations.77 Other

Box 8.5 Parking charges: A promising source of ﬁnance for public and non-motorized transport

Parking charges have been introduced in many local authorities
in cities across the world, as a source of revenue to ﬁnance
local trans port services. In Milton Keynes (UK), revenues from
parking fees are dedicated to supporting public transport.
Similar implementations worldwide include Aspen (Colorado,
US), Miami (Florida, US), La Spezia, Verona and Milan (Italy).

Current parking planning practices tend to favour

generous parking supply and minimal parking places, which
have unintended and undesirable consequences: they increase
devel op ment costs, reduce housing affordability, increase
private car use and contribute to urban sprawl. As result,
everyone but the motorist pays for parking. Consequently,
problems such as trafﬁc congestion, road infra struc ture costs,
road trafﬁc accidents and pollution emissions are further
exacerbated.

Recognizing the need for parking planning and

management reforms, urban planners have proposed the
introduction of various forms of parking fees and taxes. 

Such taxes can help raise funds and achieve various planning
objectives, including more compact devel op ment and
increased use of alternative modes. In Barcelona (Spain), 
100 per cent of the revenue gathered from parking tariffs goes
to operate ‘Bicing’, the city’s public bike system.

Parking is increasingly being linked to public transport,

and park-and-ride schemes have been introduced in many
cities across the world, as an efﬁcient means of managing car
travel demand. This also allows for increased ﬂexibility and
enhanced intermodality for travellers, in particular women
who tend to have several destinations for their trips, 
as they may need the car to drop off their children at school,
but might prefer to use public trans port to get to work. In
Prague (Czech Republic), park-and-ride facilities are
established near metro and railway stations. These car parks
offer low all-day prices, which include the fare for the public
trans port system.

Planning and Design for Sustainable Urban Mobility

Box 8.6 Versement transport, Paris, France

Versement trans port was ﬁrst introduced in 1971 for the Ile 
de France (Paris) region, with the purpose of providing a
consistent funding base to operate and invest in public
transport. Versement trans port is a compulsory tax levied on
public and private companies with more than nine employees,
with rates collected as a percentage of a company’s total
payroll costs (although with a ﬁxed ceiling imposed by the
state). Over the years, the geographical coverage of this
scheme has extended to all metropolitan areas with a public
trans port authority. The tax rate is determined by local
authorities but varies from region to region, ranging from 
0.5 per cent to 2.6 per cent.

Before this tax was implemented, public trans port in
France was mainly funded through user fares. However the
revenue base generated from versement trans port now

represents a major source of ﬁnance, which has lowered the
costs of public trans port while also supporting large-scale
infra struc ture projects, such as Strasbourg’s light-rail system
and the implementation of the metro in Marseille. In 2007, 
the incomes from versement trans port in the Paris region
accounted for a third of all funds allocated to public 
transport.

However, critics believe that versement trans port adds
more to the cost of labour, something which is undesirable
given the high rates of unemployment. It has also been
criticized for encouraging urban sprawl, as companies relocate
their business outside the main urban area to avoid paying
such taxes.

Allen, 2011b.

beneﬁts include increased property values where land
is serviced by public trans port and for other road users
who experi ence less congestion.

Value-capture models
Since direct public funding is almost always politically
vulnerable  (particularly  in  periods  of  ﬁnan cial
austerity), it is preferable to link publicly sponsored
forms of ﬁnan cial support as directly as possible to
the beneﬁts urban mobility bestows upon indirect
beneﬁciaries. It is within that context that location-
based  taxes  and  assessments  to  support  trans port
service  have  become  popularly  labelled  as  value-
capture systems. The term reﬂects the reality that
urban trans port does, via external beneﬁts, create
value for parties not directly using the service. This
approach is politically appealing because it is able to
explain how the charge relates to the beneﬁt and to
provide qualitative support commensurate with the
needs of a growing city.

Hong  Kong  is  undoubtedly  the  best-known
instance where a provider of public trans port covers
the full costs and attains a proﬁt through the use of
a value-capture model.78 The essential elements of
this unusual situation result from the unique, public-
private, corporate structure of the service provider,
i.e. the Mass Transit Railway Corporation (MTRC)
(Box 8.7). It has both a public mission to provide trans -
port to a major city, but at the same time (thanks to
the public trading of its minority shares) it is strongly
governed  by  the  earnings  considerations  of  the
private  market.  This  arrangement  bestows  import-
ant urban access beneﬁts on the entire Hong Kong
region. And, due to a direct linkage to the ongoing
real estate yields, the MTRC is able to sustain urban
public trans port via the process of value capture.

The practice as it has evolved in Hong Kong is
unique  to  the  institutional  arrangements  there.

However, the underlying principle has widespread
applicability. Although the term value capture is of
recent vintage, the principle has long been under -
stood  as  an  important  element  in  the  creation  of
urban  public  transportation  (Box  8.8).  The  lesson
learned from the Hong Kong experi ence is that it is
possible to practice value capture in service to the
public interest. However, other cities also have a tra -
dition of ﬁnancing transportation projects by taxing
real estate that beneﬁts from infra struc ture projects.
In Bogotá, Colombia, for example, road expansion,
improvement  of  public  space,  bicycle  paths  and
TransMilenio lines have all beneﬁted from this kind
of ﬁnancing.79

It is the principle of creating an agency that is
capable of bridging the land use and trans port divide
in the service of enhanced urban access that is the
important lesson to draw from the experi ence. The
range  of  experiments  with  parking  fees,  highway 
tolls, congestion charges and land taxes are all varia -
tions on the principle of value capture (Box 8.4). Tax-
increment  ﬁnancing  also  works  according  to  the
same principle: when a site’s value increases due to
the implementation of new trans port infra struc ture,
the govern ment can anticipate an additional incre -
ment in real estate taxes, and can borrow against this
anticipated tax revenue to ﬁnance imple mentation of
the trans port infra struc ture.80 Similarly, private inves -
tors may provide capital for transportation projects in
exchange for a share of revenue over time.81

Value-capture  approaches  work  best  in  cities
where  there  is  initially  low  per  capita  car  use  and
where the population is growing.82 The ﬁrst condition
means that there is less resistance to overcoming car
dependence  and  the  second  means  that  there  is  a
strong potential customer base for the system. These
conditions  hold  almost  universally  in  the  rapidly
growing  cities  of  Sub-Saharan  Africa  and  Asia.  In
cities  where  population  growth  is  stable  or  even

Box 8.7 Hong Kong and its Mass Transit Railway Corporation, China

Hong Kong’s MTRC builds, owns and operates all the rail
lines in Hong Kong. MTRC is unique among public
transportation providers, in that it is a private for-proﬁt
corporation that is 76.7 per cent owned by the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region, which in turn owns all land in
Hong Kong. The rest of the shares are publicly traded on the
Hong Kong stock exchange. Due to its relationship with
MTRC, the govern ment is able to capture the monetary value
of the access and agglomeration economies that its trans port
service generates.

Hong Kong’s unique ﬁnan cial model works as follows.

The Hong Kong govern ment makes land around future station
stops available to the MTRC on long-term lease at pre-
trans port devel op ment prices. The MTRC then sells the rights
to develop these sites – at post-devel op ment prices – to
designated private developers, who leverage the station
locations for the creation of shopping malls and housing. 
The substantial difference between the two prices pays for the
capital cost of the new rail infra struc ture.

Further more, and most importantly, MTRC also

negotiates a share of future property-devel op ment proﬁts
and/or a co-ownership position from the highest bidder, 

i.e. the MTRC retains a long-term claim on the rental income
stream of these projects. Thus, MTRC is paid up front for land,
plus a post-devel op ment share of the devel op ment’s revenues,
in addition to collecting fares. It is that long-term claim on
urban value that turns this enterprise from just another
struggling provider of public trans port into a sterling
corporate performer.

Between 2001 and 2005, property devel op ments – 

i.e. devel op ment, investment and management – produced 
62 per cent of MTRC’s revenues. Railway income, made up
mainly of fare-box receipts, generated 28 per cent of total
income. The remaining 10 per cent of income was generated
from advertisement and ownership of other assets 
(i.e. telecommunication leases and convenience retail 
shops).

One of the strong factors in the success of MTRC is that

– in addition to satisfying initial conditions (there is a strong
ﬁnan cial disincentive to car ownership, and population density
is quite high) – more than 40 per cent of Hong Kong’s
population resides within 500 metres of an MTRC station and
one in ﬁve households live within 200 metres of a station.
Sources: Pan et al, 2011; Cervero and Murakami, 2008b; MTRC, undated.

Box 8.8  Value capture has a long history to ensure private sector proﬁts

In the early days of modern public transport, the late
nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, private developers
who built the ﬁrst street railway systems understood the
connection between the public trans port improvements they
were creating and land values in the streets that abutted the
systems. They purchased land at the outskirts of the city and
gained franchises to operate public trans port over the streets
running through the parcels of land they owned. They then
installed the street rail infra struc ture and as soon as the land
had been developed and sold, the revenue-losing public trans -
port routes were abandoned to the public sector to maintain
from that time forward.

Starting in the 1910s, these systems began to falter and

because they were by then vital public services, they soon
became publicly owned and operated systems with the
difference between costs and fare revenues provided by
municipal general funds. The history of urban public trans -
port in North America is replete with examples of this. In
1917, for example, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts
passed its ﬁrst public control act, taking over the public
trans port routes running through the City of Boston to its
suburbs.
Sources: Edel et al, 1984; Schrag, 2000; Schaeffer and Sclar, 1980.

declining and car use is extensive – as is the case in
many  cities  of  North  America  and  Europe  –  value
capture via claims on rising real estate revenues will
typically be disappointing, no matter how well they are
organ ized.

Assuming that the right demographic and modal
use conditions exist, the next most critical factor is
the distance between places of residence and public
trans port stops, whether they are BRT or rail. It has
been estimated that for every 10 per cent increase
in distance from a public trans port station, there is
a 1 per cent decline in property values.83 Hence the
closer the target population is to the public trans -
port stops, the higher is the relative real estate value

and the larger is the potential base of support for
the system (Box 8.7).

Three institutional factors in particular are vitally
important  in  the  successful  deployment  of  value-
capture mechanisms:

• Municipal govern ments need strong capability to
value land and levy land taxes as well as impose
fees on car users in the form of congestion charges
and parking fees.

• These  govern ments  need  a  strong  ability  to
regulate  (if  not  control)  the  assembly  of  land
parcels that line up with plans for building trans -
port infra struc ture.

Public–private
partnership . . . is
a ﬂexible concept
that runs across 
a continuum of
contractual
arrangements 

• The  capacity  of  govern ment  to  act  as  a  know -
ledgeable business partner is critical if the public–
private partnership’s ability to manage the attend -
ant real estate devel op ments is to be sus tain able.

Other public–private partnerships
Value capture as practised in Hong Kong is a highly
speciﬁc application of a more general approach to the
provision  of  public  services,  called  public–private
partnerships. A public–private partnership is a con -
tractual agreement between a public sector entity –
such as a ministry, a department or agency – and a
private sector partner to deliver a speciﬁc facility or
service  that  is  a  public  responsibility.  A  public–
private  partnership  model  is  not  a  single  model.
Rather  it  is  a  ﬂexible  concept  that  runs  across  a
continuum of contractual arrangements ranging from
traditional forms of govern ment procurement all the
way to total private ownership of publicly used infra -
struc ture (Box 8.9).84

In terms of infra struc ture, these arrangements
can include design, construction, renovation opera -
tion,  maintenance  or  ﬁnancing  of  practically  any
public facility or public service. In terms of urban
mobility, the purpose of these arrangements – from
the perspective of the public partner – is to obtain
the  beneﬁts  of  expensive  elements  of  networked
trans port  infra struc ture,  while  avoiding  the  costs
and risks inherent in both construction and main -
tenance. For the private partner the ultimate goal is
a healthy return on the capital invested. Such arrange -
ments  involve  contracts  that  may  extend  over
decades.

However,  economists  term  such  contractual
situations as ‘incomplete contracts’85 because it is

impossible to write a binding legal agreement that
can foresee all the possible permutations of circum -
stance in which the parties to the arrangement might
ﬁnd themselves. As a result, the parties usually make
provisions  such  as  requiring  arbitration  or  some
other form of third-party governance to (hopefully)
resolve differences of opinion and circumstance, as
they  will  inevitably  arise  over  the  term  of  the
agreement. Nonetheless the difﬁculty of negotiating
such changing circumstances makes these arrange -
ments far less stable in practice than they appear in
theory. As a result this requires that public partners
ask  careful  questions  before  engaging  in  such
arrangements.

One  major  unstated  but  powerful  motivation 
for the public partners in such situations is to pass
the risks of construction and maintenance off to the
private party. The private party’s motivation for incur -
ring  the  risk  is  to  gain  a  positive  return  on  their
investment. Because the private party has a signiﬁcant
amount of capital at risk they go to great lengths to
limit the extent of their risk and liability.86

In  a  typical  infra struc ture  public–private  part -
nership the private partner is actually a consortium
of ﬁrms that form what are known as ‘special pur-
pose vehicles’, which are independent, stand-alone
entities tailored to the speciﬁc public-sector request.
These vehicles help insulate and contain the scope
of  project-related  risk  to  the  parent  companies. 
The basic problem from a public perspective is that
ultimately the public sector can never fully off-load
the risk (see also Box 8.10). The private party always
has the option of bankruptcy to unburden themselves
of an untenable situation. But because the investment
involves vital elements of public infra struc ture, the
public partner can never walk away. The result is that

Box 8.9 Types of public–private partnerships

Public-private partnership projects attempt to provide options between the extremes of full public and full private control. There
are a wide variety of potential public–private partnerships, as shown in the table below. In fact, a ‘partnership’ begins whenever the
govern ment decides to allow the private sector to control one or more of the activities that it traditionally managed on its own.

Box 8.10 Economic rationale for using public–private partnerships

How can a public agency know if a public–private partnership
is a better arrangement than the more traditional way of
creating public infra struc ture? The typical valuation process
employed to provide a proximate answer to this question is a
process called value-for-money analysis.

As public sector borrowing costs are normally less than
those of private parties, a straight comparison of construction
costs alone almost always favours public construction over a
public–private partnership. To avoid this problem, value-for-
money analysis justiﬁes the use of a public–private partnership
when it can be shown that the discounted ﬁnan cial costs, over
the life of the project, are lower than the costs of conventional
procurement.

However, it is virtually impossible to know if these
lifecycle costs will be lower. To get around this challenge,
public agencies often construct a hypothetical projection of
what the operation would cost if it remained public (based on
comparable past experi ences from elsewhere). The basic

problem for such a comparative cost analyst is deciding which
partner bears that risk over time; the more risk that can be
apportioned to the public sector, the higher are the costs of
the public sector comparator. Public–private partnership
proponents argue that risk should be borne by the party most
able to carry it. Invariably, that is the public sector, so value-
for-money analysis almost always demonstrates that the
public–private partnership is less costly.

In practice, there are no ways to know in advance if a
speciﬁc public–private partnership will be cost effective. In
effect, public–private partnerships proceed more often as a
matter of faith than experi ence. However, this having been
said, it is important to also note that a ‘value for money
assessment should also take into account the potential non-
ﬁnan cial beneﬁts of PPPs [public–private partnerships] such as
the accelerated and enhanced delivery of projects’.a
Sources: ACCA, 2004; Central PPP Unit in the Department of Finance Govern ment of
Ireland, 2007; a EPEC, 2012.

the public sector often ﬁnds itself in the position of
buying out the private partner at great cost to the
public treasury (Box 8.11).

In 1997, the UK Govern ment decided to over -
haul  the  London  Underground,  the  world’s  oldest
metro system, through a public–private partnership

(Box  8.11).  When  the  public–private  partnership 
was put in place in 2002, the net present value of
the  30  years  long  arrangement  was  estimated  at
£15.7 billion.87 However, within just a few years, the
private sector partners went bankrupt.88 It has been
estimated that the legal and other consulting costs

Box 8.11 The use of a public–private partnership to upgrade the London Underground, UK

When the UK govern ment decided to upgrade the London
Underground in 1997 it was decided to undertake this infra -
struc ture upgrading as a public-private partnership. The
govern ment believed this was a sensible move following years
of underfunding and ﬁnan cial instability. Further more, it was
also believed that while the weak management of London’s
underground led to cost and time inefﬁciencies, the operation
of trains had been satisfactory.

A complex public–private partnership structure was
developed, whereby the three public–private partnership
consortia were set up to carry out different parts of the
maintenance and rehabilitation of the underground infra struc -
ture. The public sector retained ownership and responsibility
for the delivery of transportation services.

Speciﬁc and carefully written contracts meant that the
infra struc ture ‘companies’ (infracos) would be fully invested
through performance-based incentives and penalties, tied to
the speciﬁcations of the contracts. To account for possible
unanticipated costs, as a result of age of the metro system, a
public arbiter was appointed to adjudicate claims for such
unforeseen costs during the maintenance and renewal of train
systems. Provisions were also made for a periodic review of
contractual arrangements every 7.5 years.

However, the project was at a dis advan tage from the

outset as infracos used private capital to ﬁnance the

public–private partnership that was to be repaid through the
annual loan payments made by the govern ment. This was a
more costly option as the cost of private borrowing was
greater than raising capital through public bonds. In addition
private lenders demanded a public guarantee of 95 per cent on
their loans. Thus, as the risk borne by lenders was minimal,
there was little or no incentive to review the efﬁciency of
infracos or hold them accountable for the use of the money
given to them. If the project failed, which it eventually did, risk
fell upon the public sector.

Two major problems undermined this public–private
partnership agreement. The ﬁrst was the fragmentation of
operations and construction between public and private
partners. The infracos were seeking to carry out work that
maximized their proﬁts but didn’t necessarily address London
Underground’s mission of service delivery. Construction
work, for example, was continually carried out at inconvenient
times. The second problem was the lack of coordination and
fragmentation between the two main consortiums involved.
This resulted in inefﬁcient implementation, without a clear
corporate governance structure. In hindsight it may thus be
said that the long-term survival of this project was doomed
from the outset.

involved in designing the structure for this public–
private  partnership  amounted  to  almost  £500
million.89 Between these start-up transactions costs
and losses caused by guarantees to private banks, plus
cost overruns on the contracts, it is estimated that
this public–private partnership cost UK taxpayers over
£2 billion of unnecessary loss, and left London with
a large number of subway stations in various states
of disrepair. This was the result of a ‘deal that was
forced on their city by the central govern ment . . .
And this is just the beginning: costs for the City of
London are . . . expected to grow by an additional
£1 billion’.90

As  a  result  of  the  care  put  into  constructing 
the  public–private  partnership  model,  this  project
exempliﬁes the forethought required to implement
such major urban trans port public works via public–
private partnerships. At the same time, the fact that
this  30-year  project  was  completely  dissolved  one
quarter of the way through, in 2010, also makes it
an  important  cautionary  experi ence  about  the
inherent limits of such an approach to major public
works. Presently the refurbishment of the London
Underground is proceeding as an in-house project of
trans port  for  London,  the  London  Underground’s
parent agency. All indications are that it is generally
proceeding on time and on budget.91

This London experi ence is instructive on several

levels:

• It demonstrates the problems that arise when the
public  and  private  partners  have  different  per -
ceptions of the mission.

• It demonstrates the fact that the start-up costs of
establishing  a  public–private  partnership  –  in
terms of consultant and operating costs – can be
much higher than expected when these processes
begin. These transaction costs are typically either
ignored  or  badly  underestimated  when  the
public–private partnership is being designed and
politically promoted.

• One of the promises of bringing in private part-
ners to manage public infra struc ture is that they
will  introduce  new  and  innovative  technology.
Although  that  can  happen  in  some  cases,  in
general once contracts are signed, entities (be they
public or private) become risk averse and seek to
protect proﬁts from assured revenue streams.

• Finally, it demonstrates that even when there is
an attempt to overcome the problems of incom -
plete contracting with highly speciﬁed contract
terms, in regard to deliverables, dates and penalty
clauses,  the  problem  of  contract  compliance
becomes a serious impediment.

The most important lesson from this experi ence is
that the simpler and clearer the terms of engagement
in a public–private partnership are, the more likely
it is for the public sector to achieve its goals.

When  public–private  partnerships  fail,  they
always  do  so  for  reasons  unique  to  the  individual
situation. This leads to a temptation to say that the
next effort will avoid those problems and everything
will go as planned. Indeed international consulting
ﬁrms publish ‘how to’ guides in which they state that
there is a need for knowledge and transparency all
around.92 However, the underlying generic problem
is that public–private partnerships, if they are dealing
with  signiﬁcant  urban  trans port challenges,  are
dealing with situations in which information is always
incomplete  and  future  situations  uncertain  and
changing.

Combination models
Finance for most urban trans port systems is typically
a combination of sources that resemble value capture
in  some  aspects  and  general  revenue  funding
approaches in others. It is likely that for most systems
some combination of these along with direct user
charges is the most realistic ﬁnan cial arrangements.
The  speciﬁc  ﬁnan cial  structure  of  any  particular
system will depend greatly on the historic context
in which it operates and local norms and values with
regard  to  the  structure  of  the  public  sector.  The
challenge is to understand how models that combine
elements of user and public revenues can successfully
operate  in  practice.  This  section  reviews  experi -
ences from New York and India.

The  New  York  Metropolitan  Transportation
Authority  (MTA)  provides  an  example  of  ways  in
which diverse revenue sources can be collected by a
single agency and focused on providing a multi-modal
regional trans port system (Box 8.12). The agency relies
on a diverse mix of revenues from federal, state and
local govern ments and a collection of taxes earmarked
for transportation. Lastly, the revenue surplus from
tolls on bridges and tunnels is an important part of the
MTA ﬁnances and an implicit cross-subsidy from car
and truck users to public trans port customers.

The attractiveness of New York’s regionally and
modally integrated urban trans port system is that it
facilitates an easy distribution of costs and revenues
across modes. This in turn provides a potentially easily
used policy tool with which to encourage the pursuit
of a sus tain able urban mobility system. However, it
is important to understand that timing and institu -
tional context matter greatly. The ﬁrst decade of the
New York experi ence was fraught with many political
difﬁculties,  as  each  agency  fought  to  protect  its
existing  autonomy  within  the  new  organizational
format.  Hence  while  the  model  provides  some
promise for the potential of integration and move -
ment towards a true ‘urban trans port system’, it also
requires strong govern mental administrative capacity
and dedication to succeed.

Responding to the poor quality of public trans -
port in  India,  the  Govern ment  of  India  is  actively

Box 8.12 Multiple funding sources: The New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority, US

New York has one of the oldest and largest urban trans port
systems in the world and its evolution over the past century is
instructive in terms of how metropolitan systems can adapt
over time to multiple funding streams. In 1968, New York
State consolidated the administration and ﬁnancing of all 
trans port infra struc ture and rolling stock in the metropolitan
region into a single trans port agency, the MTA. The main
motivation for this administrative consolidation was to
consolidate the planning and ﬁnances for all modes.

The MTA is responsible for regional trans port for an

area extending over 130,000 square kilometres and containing
a population of about 20 million. The responsibilities include
New York City’s metro system comprised of both elevated
and subway lines and ﬁxed-route bus system, suburban buses,
Long Island Railroad, Metro-North Railroad, Long Island Bus
and the principal bridges and tunnels that carry car and truck
trafﬁc in and around the region.

As metro fares cover only 60 per cent of operations,
other revenue sources are required. The MTA collects tolls
on its bridges and tunnels too, but incomes are still insufﬁcient.

As a result, the State of New York permits the MTA to derive
other revenues from four different taxes:

•

•

•

•

a small (0.25 per cent) tax on all transactions in the 12
counties of the MTA region;
a regional franchise tax levied on certain business 
activities;
a transportation-oriented tax called the ‘long lines tax’,
which is levied on trucking, telegraph and
telecommunications companies;
a ‘petroleum business tax’, which is levied on reﬁning or
selling petroleum state-wide.

The ﬁrst two of these are regional taxes, which provide the
majority of non-fare revenue operating funds. Such taxes are,
however, not good sources of stable funding, as they are highly
sensitive to ﬂuctuations in the economy during recessionary
times. The last two taxes are imposed state-wide, and as a
result, the MTA gets only a portion of them: 48 per cent of the
long lines revenue and 55 per cent of the petroleum tax.

Box 8.13 Funding of public trans port investments: Lessons from Delhi and Ahmedabad, India

India’s National Urban Transport Policy (NUTP) explicitly
shifted the focus of trans port policy away from reactive
congestion relief through road and highway expansion to the
proactive promotion of non-motorized trans port and
improvement of public trans port systems. NUTP is funded
under the seven-year (2005–2011) JnNURM, which provided
centrally ﬁnanced grants to urban trans port projects in speciﬁc
cities that complied with NUTP guidelines. The Janmarg BRT
in Ahmedabad and the Delhi Metro (Phase II) are among the
ﬁrst projects funded under this programme.

At the level of practice, several key principles for

investing in economically sus tain able urban trans port devel op -
ment can be extracted from this experi ence. These include:

•

Local buy-in: Both Janmarg and Delhi Metro demonstrate
the importance of local ownership of projects. Political
commitment at all levels is vital to implementation success,
but local-level buy-in – particularly at the agency and
bureaucratic level – is also essential. Local ownership can
generate cost savings through better utilization of local
resources, and improves the responsiveness of the design
and construction process to local conditions. A ﬁrm belief
by local implementation teams in the beneﬁts of their
schemes is also important in building public acceptance.

• Multi-tiered ﬁnancing: Financing of urban trans port

systems should be multi-tiered, combining various funding
options according to the relative comparative advantages
of different funding actors and the short-term and long-
term ﬁnancing needs of the schemes (e.g. capital
investment versus recurrent expenditures). Delhi in

particular was effective in drawing in alternative ﬁnancing
options from a variety of international, national, state and
local stakeholders.

• Dedicated agency: The creation of a single purpose

•

•

agency to implement and operate public trans port
schemes minimized the need for coordination across
multiple agencies. However, under this arrangement extra
care needs to be taken to ensure proper integration with
other modes of mobility.
Incremental implementation: There are both physical
and ﬁnan cial advantages to carefully planned, incremental
implementation. Pay-offs include improved design, time
savings, cost savings through feedback and modiﬁcation as
well as greater public acceptance and increased ridership.
Ahmedabad provided a particularly effective example of
this.
Innovative technology: Technology can play an important
role in public acceptance of a scheme. Modern
communication and ticketing technology has the potential
to greatly facilitate integration of different modes of
transport. But the value of ‘modernization’ also lies in its
visual association with cleanliness, safety and comfort. 
This is particularly important in devel op ing countries
where aspirations for modernization are often
synonymous with the use of private cars (or motorbikes).

• Affordability/equity: Affordable fares are absolutely

critical and should never be sacriﬁced in a quest for ﬁnan -
cial cost recovery.

formalized  in  the  National  Urban  Transport  Policy 
(of 2006), through the use of strong ﬁnan cial incen -
tives  targeted  at  local  govern ments.  The  Janmarg 
BRT and Delhi Metro projects present two alterna-
tive responses to this new policy (Box 8.13). Although
they  differ  in  terms  of  scale,  mode  and  speciﬁc
approaches, the different solutions made by the two
projects reﬂect similar common successful principles
for ﬁnancing sus tain able urban mobility systems.

The two Indian projects illustrate the ways in
which national govern ments can organize ﬁnance to
stimulate local investments in urban public transport.
Both cases show how supportive national policies,
accompanied by ﬁnan cial incentives, can play a critical
role  in  the  adoption  and  implementation  of  more 
sus tain able forms of urban transport. Further more,
both experi ences were backed by signiﬁcant grant
contributions towards capital costs. The experi ences
demonstrate the importance of inter-govern mental
cooperation  and  the  need  for  a  clear  local  public
authority  over  the  operation  of  public  trans port
systems.93

Overall,  there  is  an  important  lesson  here
concerning the need to ensure that – as a general
rule of thumb – operating costs should be tied to
fares,  but  capital  costs  need  a  broader  source  of
revenues, a source that relates to the broader access
values that the system creates. The MTRC in Hong
Kong provides a good example of this (Box 8.7).

CONCLUDING REMARKS
AND LESSONS FOR POLICY
In order to be sus tain able, urban mobility systems
must  be  organized  by  a  ﬁnan cial  model  that  is
designed to protect the important public goods aspect
of public transport. As the experi ences recounted in
this  chapter  make  clear,  there  is  a  wide  and  ﬂex-
ible  range  of  ways  in  which  these  models  can  be
organized. However, there is no simple ‘best-practice’
approach to designing such ﬁnan cial models. Instead,
one should look beyond the individual experi ences
and  look  for  principles  that  can  be  replicated  in
another  setting.  This  section  presents  seven  prin -
ciples that should inform the evolution of sus tain -
able urban trans port ﬁnance.

The goal of an urban mobility system, as a public
good,  is  to  promote  access  and  not  mobility.
Mobility is merely one means to the achievement of
that larger end. Consequently, policies should reﬂect
the value of access and not the time saved through
enhanced mobility systems.

High-density  and  mixed-use  locations  reduce
the need for mobility and provide access through
co-location of important urban activities. In terms

of modal options, it is important that these be inte -
grated  so  that  users  can  move  easily  from  one 
mode  to  another.  For  example,  park-and-ride  lots 
at  the  periphery  of  a  dense  urban  settlement  can
allow travel lers to easily leave cars and enter public
trans port for  the  ﬁnal  legs  of  journeys  into  these 
places.

An  urban  area  with  good  public  trans port is 
more likely to also have urban spaces conducive to
pedestrian access and non-motorized transport. Only
public  trans port developed  as  a  public  good
can  make  this  happen.  Once  that  is  in  place,  the
challenges  from  private  motorized  trans port are
reduced to a point where they are practically solvable.
Urban public trans port should aim to be a
high-quality  service.  An  urban  public  trans port
system that is viewed largely as a system for the use
of the poor quickly becomes a poor system. If govern -
ment is seeking to induce car drivers to use public
transport, it is important that the alternative be safe,
reliable, comfortable and plentiful. A system used by
residents  from  all  walks  of  life  is  a  system  that  is
politically (as well as economically) sus tain able.

Cities should strive towards full cost pricing
for cars. Cars do not pay prices that match the full
value  of  the  economic  and  social  costs  that  they
impose in the pursuit of access. Revenues collected
via  congestion  pricing  and  licensing  fees  should
reﬂect the costs that private car use imposes on urban
life. However, it is both short sighted and ineffective
to  attempt  to  sustain  public  trans port systems  via
monies raised by car-based charges. These monies
alone will almost never be sufﬁcient to allow for the
creation  and  ﬁnan cial  sus tain ability  of  high-quality
urban public transport.

Schemes that successfully permit urban trans -
port to be supported by the value of the access that
they create can provide a strong basis for sus tain-
able urban mobility. Value capture can be done via
real  estate  taxes  that  reﬂect  the  value  of  location 
as well as through complex land investments. The
more exclusive and high density the modes of travel,
such as rail and BRT, the higher will be the capture-
able values. Further more, in terms of land use, the
closer the places of residence and other activities are
to terminals, the higher values and volume of use
can be expected. Value capture does not work as well
on more ordinary bus routes or in places where car
use is already very high and/or where populations are
stagnant or shrinking.

Good  public  trans port requires  a  capable
public  sector.  The  debate  about  the  relative
efﬁciency  of  public  and  private  agents  in  the
production of public trans port has been an irrelevant
distraction. Regardless of organizational form, the key
to success in creating effective urban mobility systems
is  always  a  capable  public  governing  authority
operating in a transparent manner.

below, cost–beneﬁt analyses
often measure the value of time
according to average wages.
Using similar methods, the 
cost of vehicle congestion has
been estimated at US$0.845 
per litre of petrol in the US, 
and US$0.190 in the UK. 
By comparison, pollution
contributes comparatively less
to the total marginal external
cost of driving (US$0.048 and
US$0.053, in each country
respectively) (Parry and Small,
2005).

63 Typically, advocates for raising
the cost of car usage also argue
for transferring the revenues
received to public transport.
While this is a reasonable step,
it has never been demonstrated
that these revenues alone are
sufﬁcient to address the full
costs of adequately enhanced
public transport. Further more,
by only going that far in policy
terms, these advocates avoid
the more politically charged 
but still underlying substantive
issues of urban equity.

It is import to note that this
problem is endemic to passen -
ger trans port in general and not
to urban public trans port in
particular. Intercity passen ger
rail systems do not cover full
costs through fares. Individual
airlines do make proﬁts on
individual routes, though even
these are not steady. Proﬁts
ﬂuctuate with fuel costs and
business cycles. Most
importantly, the air trafﬁc
control system, on which
individual private routes depend,
is publicly maintained.

70 This chapter does not include a
discussion of the role of ofﬁcial
devel op ment assistance and
foreign direct investments for
the ﬁnancing of urban transport,
although this may play an
increasing role in the future. 
‘A global devel op ment
partnership should promote the
ﬂow of longer-term investment,
including FDI [foreign direct
investment], to a greater
number of devel op ing countries
and into critical sectors such 
as transport’ (UN System Task
Team on the Post-2015 UN
Devel op ment Agenda, 2013,
p10). However, from an
analytical point of view, such
ﬁnance should be considered
primarily as direct public
allocation, subject to
considerations beyond the
control of local authorities, or
subject to arrangements similar

to those of private–public
partnerships. Chapter 7 includes
a discussion on international
funding mechanisms for environ -
mentally sus tain able transport.

INSTITUTIONS AND GOVERNANCE
FOR URBAN MOBILITY

Institutional  and  governance  frameworks  are  the
structures  through  which  political,  technical  and
ﬁnan cial  decisions  are  translated  into  resource
allocation and priority setting for implementing urban
mobility plans, programmes and projects. No matter
how good the policy recommendations, their imple -
mentation  is  dependent  upon  how  ﬁt-for-purpose
these institutional and governance frame works are
to direct, manage, resource and deliver them. Visions
of sus tain able urban mobility cannot be translated
into  plans,  nor  can  plans  be  successfully  imple -
mented, without addressing the very sus tain ability
of the key organizations involved and their institu -
tional and governance frameworks.

Institutional  and  governance  frameworks  and
their related networks are critical to how well (and
how fast) urban trans port infra struc ture and services
are planned, appraised, delivered and operated. They
are also essential to how well joined-up urban mobility
planning  is  with  land-use  devel op ments,  and  how
consistent both are with the declared goals of sus -
tain able devel op ment.

In  many  cities,  formal  institutions  that  affect 
the trans port sector frequently operate in a less than
desirable  manner.  This  is  particularly  the  case  in
devel op ing countries. Notwithstanding this, people
and goods continue to circulate, and indeed in many
cases  trafﬁc  continues  to  rise.  The  issue  here,
however, is with what suboptimum level of efﬁciency
is  this  achieved,  at  what  opportunity  cost  and  at
whose cost does this growth take place?

The chapter starts with a clariﬁcation of the main
terms  used  in  the  discussion  of  urban  mobility
institutions  and  governance.  This  is  followed  by  a
regional review of current conditions and trends of
institutional and governance devel op ments that affect
urban mobility policy-making, planning and manage -
ment and ultimately, many aspects of urban land-use
devel op ments.  A  number  of  key  institutional  and
governance  challenges  and  underlying  inﬂuences
facing cities are then drawn from this review. The
chapter also contains a discussion of policy responses

to  these  challenges,  with  some  detailed  examples
drawn from good practice. It ends with concluding
remarks and lessons for policy makers.

UNDERSTANDING
INSTITUTIONAL AND
GOVERNANCE
FRAMEWORKS FOR URBAN
MOBILITY
The  interaction  of  the  institutional  structure  and
agency  actors  is  characterized  by  both  formal
dimensions (i.e. rules and laws) and informal dimen -
sions  (i.e.  customs  and  traditions),  which  impact
relations between different branches of govern ment.1
In  some  instances,  there  are  institutions  (such  as
trade  unions,  city  chambers  of  commerce  and
industrial  lobbying  groups)  that  –  although  not
formally part of the urban trans port decision-making
processes – possess varying degrees of inﬂuence. The
extent they do reﬂects their political inﬂuence and
often the power of their purse. Enlightened institut -
ional and governance frameworks seek to make these
inﬂuences transparent.

Well-functioning institutions and a high level of
political  support  are  essential  for  creating  and
maintaining good quality infra struc ture and services
for urban mobility.2 Urban mobility is also impacted
by parties from outside the trans port sector associated
with land use and social and environ mental impacts.
In devel op ing countries in particular, powerful non-
specialist  stakeholders  can  exert  inﬂuences  that
seriously undermine efforts at achieving integrated
devel op ment  between  urban  movement  and  land
use.3

The practice of policy-making and planning for
urban mobility generally rests with institutions at the
level  of  an  urban  area.  However,  as  this  may  not
coincide  with  the  administrative  boundary  of  the

Planning and Design for Sustainable Urban Mobility

dominant city, organizations at a national (and some -
times regional/provincial) govern ment level also set
frameworks that can signiﬁcantly inﬂuence policies
that are (and are not) adopted.4 These inﬂuence the
extent  of  the  institutional  integration  of  trans port
modes  in  an  urban  area,  as  well  as  the  arrange-
ments for their integration with other sectors. This
is  particularly  the  case  with  respect  to  land  use,
emissions,  climate  change,  safety  and  ﬁnance.  In
some major cities of devel op ing countries – where
national  (or  regional/state)  govern ments  involve
themselves  extensively  in  urban  trans port policy
decisions  –  many  problems  can  arise.  This  is  so
because such levels of govern ment are typically more
powerful  and  exert  more  inﬂuence/control  over
budgets assigned to the urban level. Further more,
city authorities typically lack the strong management
and professional staff capabilities necessary to tackle
the challenges that confront them. As a result, while
they may be fully aware of what needs to be done,
coordination between the two levels of govern ment
is often not easy and frequently unequal.

The role of informal structures and organizations
in the urban trans port sector needs to be emphasized.
These  are  especially  relevant  to  public  transport,
freight  movement  and  non-motorized  transport. 
Even in the well-ordered cities of many developed
countries,  the  informal  sector  and  NGOs  play  an
increas ingly important role in facilitating and encour -
aging sus tain able urban mobility. The involvement
of  such  informal  structures  and  organiza tions  is
essential  for  good  governance  and  a  ‘bottom-up’
decision-making process that enables all stake holders
to participate. In the case of urban mobility, such
decision-making  should  ideally  em brace  all  key
stakeholders involved in the provision of urban trans -
port infra struc ture  and  services,  as  well  as  those
impacted by decisions the sector makes.

Likewise,  institutional  and  governance  frame -
works should address concerns regarding obstacles
to the effective participation of the private sector.
Thus, enabling and regulative mechanisms need to
be put in place by govern ment to ensure that informa -
tion employed to support urban trans port proposals
are  comprehensive,  accurate,  impartial  and  trans -
parent.

CONDITIONS AND TRENDS
Different  parts  of  the  world  have  different  gover-
nance  structures  for  urban  mobility  delivery,  with
various institutional stakeholders inﬂuencing urban
devel op ment and mobility trends. It is particularly
important  to  note  that  the  policy  and  planning
challenges  of  urban  mobility  in  devel op ing  coun-
tries and in countries with economies in transition
differ signiﬁcantly from those found in urban areas
of  developed  countries.  In  general,  the  resources
(human,  technical  and  ﬁnan cial)  and  institutional

frameworks  at  the  disposal  of  policy-makers  and
planners in such cities are typically less well devel -
oped.  Thus,  the  sections  below  focus  on  selected
conditions and trends of institutional devel op ments
and governance, and their underlying inﬂuences, in
developed  countries,  countries  with  economies  in
transition and devel op ing countries.

Developed countries
The  institutional  and  governance  frameworks  for
urban  mobility  in  most  of  Europe  reﬂect  the
circumstances of mature developed economies and
institutional and governance arrangements. By and
large, European cities possess a well-educated inter -
disciplinary professional class to serve the needs of
urban mobility in particular and urban devel op ment
in general. The larger more populated countries all
have strong, multi-tier govern ments, as do the smaller
northern European countries. Signiﬁcant differences
remain, however, particularly with respect to funding
levels,  technical  capacities  and  organizational  efﬁ -
ciencies  among  many  of  the  Southern  European
countries.  In  these  countries,  institutional  and
governance  arrangements  and  technical  capacities 
are  less  well  developed  and  resourced.  There  is,
nevertheless, cross-fertilization of ideas between all
these  countries  through  numerous  EU  initiatives,
with some signiﬁcant improvements observed.5

The  city  of  Nantes,  France,  has  succeeded  to
integrate the decision-making agencies in and around
the city into one body.6 These arrangements provide
various capabilities with the agency responsible for
highway and public spaces, housing, town planning
and land-use devel op ment. This body also has the
competence for all aspects of organizing public trans -
port in the metropolitan area in which it has made
some notable advances. Since 2008, there has been
only one agency responsible for all mobility matters
in  Nantes.7 This  organization  is  ‘responsible  for
strategy  as  well  as  operational  management  of  a
whole  range  of  aspects  of  sus tain able mobility,
including roads and highway planning, trafﬁc manage -
ment, trafﬁc and public road management, cycling
and parking policies, and management including all
off-street  parking  such  as  multi-storey  car  parks,
park and rides and other sus tain able mobility services
such as car-pooling and car sharing’.8

Similar devel op ments are currently underway in
London, where surface and underground rail systems
in the metropolitan region are increasingly integrated
as  part  of  the  Mayor’s  Transport  Strategy  for  the
Greater  London  Authority,  which  comes  directly
under the ofﬁce of the mayor.9

Sixty  years  of  private  car-orientated  trans port
infra struc ture  investment  and  suburbanization  in
the US have contributed to widespread urban trafﬁc
congestion10 and created a signiﬁcant urban mobility
divide, which has seriously affected the mobility of

those who cannot afford the ownership of a private
car.11 This  car  dependency  has  been  accentuated 
by an institutional emphasis on the importance of
personal  mobility  –  whether  related  to  distances
that need to be travelled or to the general limited
availability of public transport, particularly in lower-
density cities.12

Given  the  history  of  motorization  in  the  US, 
it  is  perhaps  unexpected  that  the  country  has
introduced legislation seeking to introduce a revolu -
tion in the way urban transportation investments are
planned and implemented.13 This legislation looked
to a hierarchy of supporting transportation plans and
programmes introduced and carried out by metro -
politan planning organizations in cooperation with
states for major urban areas. However, the act does
not give these planning organizations any new legal
authority in this area. Instead it emphasises ‘partner -
ships’  between  all  relevant  agencies,  in  order  to
promote area-wide interests and goals.14

In  Canada,  the  federal  govern ment  acknow-
ledges  that  insufﬁcient  funding,  accompanied  by
fragmented planning and implementation of urban
mobility systems and related land use, are the major
obstacles  to  establishing  efﬁcient  urban  trans -
portation networks.15 As a result, the Greater Toronto
Transportation Agency was set up. This provided ‘the
governance  mechanism  to  plan,  fund  and  deliver
integrated transportation and related land use for the
entire urban region comprehensively and consistently
over time’.16 Similarly in Vancouver, the governance
structure for urban trans port attempts to coordin-
ate and achieve integration and a balance between
different  modes.  To  this  end  the  Govern ment  of
British Columbia created TransLink to assume many
transportation  responsibilities  previously  held  by 
the  provincial  govern ment  (in  1998).  TransLink  is
responsible for the regional transportation network
of Metro Vancouver in British Columbia, including
public trans port and major roads and bridges.17

Australia  has  a  federal  governance  structure, 
with responsibility for the integration of land use and
trans port  largely  resting  with  state  and  local  gov -
ernments. Although all recent major trans port infra -
structure investments in its main cities have been
made within the same federal institutional context,
the  responses  to  urban  mobility  challenges  have
been quite diverse.18 In the city of Perth, trans port
and  land-use  planning  portfolios  reside  within  the
Western  Australian  Department  of  Planning  and
Infra struc ture,  which  has  its  own  minister  in  the 
state govern ment. Public trans port is the responsi -
bility of the Public Transport Authority, a govern ment
agency whose res ponsibilities cover public trans port
(bus, train and ferry services) in Perth and regional
centres.  Two  other  agencies  (Main  Roads  and 
Depart ment of Transport) are responsible for other
trans port matters (i.e. major and minor roads, trans -
port safety, etc.).19

New  Zealand  has  seen  several  new  devel op -
ments in the institutional and governance structure
of its major cities. From the perspective of the inte -
gration  of  urban  transport,  ‘the  restructuring  of
metropolitan Auckland is one of the most substantial
and far-reaching local govern ment restructurings in
recent years. [It offers a] unique governance frame -
work  for  local  authorities’  to  manage  council-con -
trolled organizations.20 The capital city of Wellington
has also employed a regional approach to the planning
and  delivery  of  its  trans port  infra struc ture  and
services.21

Countries with economies in transition
Democratization, privatization and decentralization
have  been  the  three  main  institutional  change
processes occurring in countries that emerged from
communism in Central and Eastern Europe. At the
end  of  communist  rule  in  the  early  1990s,  these
countries  had  strong,  centralized  decision-making
systems, and a tradition of state planning of urban
land use and transportation. They also had a relatively
well-educated professional class working in secure
formal institutions, a dominance of public trans port
over private car use, and a relatively deferential civil
society.22

With  democratization,  the  strength  of  inﬂu-
ence of different stakeholders changed. The voice of
the citizenry became more fragmented, as wealthier
residents  abandoned  their  dependency  on  public
trans port systems.  At  the  same  time,  many  public
trans port operators  found  themselves  unable  to
extend their service to low-density devel op ments on
the  periphery.  Operators  simultaneously  suffered
from drastic reductions of subsidies that made public
trans port more expensive to provide and unaffordable
to many potential users.23 The sharp reductions in
govern ment subsidies in Poland, for example, forced
public  trans port services  to  raise  fares  drastically.
Meanwhile,  under-spending  led  to  poorer  public
trans port services, lower operational efﬁciencies and
a reduction in public trans port hardware and related
infra struc ture  investment.  This  resulted  in  a  gap
devel op ing between revenue and expenditure to a
point that became exceedingly difﬁcult to bridge.24
Privatization  and  neoliberal  inﬂuences  have
resulted in much more complex institutional decision-
making  devel op ments.  Together  with  the  absence 
of an understanding of how market forces operate,
there  has  been  an  (unintentional)  gradual  under -
mining of economic, social and environ mental dimen -
sions of sus tain ability by govern ments, as a result of
their extending the time between plan-making and
imple mentation.

Decentralization  –  in  the  form  of  transfer  of
responsibility for regional and local infra struc ture and
public  trans port services  to  provincial  and  local
govern ments  –  has  in  some  cases  been  excessive.

Planning and Design for Sustainable Urban Mobility

In most of Africa,
. . . the fact that
(too) many
ministries are
involved in the
urban transport
sector at the local
level contributes
to actions that 
can prove
contradictory

In the case of Poland, ‘the State has gone too far in
decentralizing all public trans port responsibilities to
the cities and has not faced squarely the complicated
issues  related  to  urban  roads’  and  trafﬁc  issues.25
The situation in Russia and many other countries (e.g.
Latvia,  Lithuania)  is  similar.  Here  the  municipal
sector  has  remained  fragmented  and  suffers  from
poor administrative capacity, which has contributed
to  weak  cooperation  between  independent  local
govern ments. This is particularly harmful in efforts
to address trans port problems in metropolitan areas
where  good  cooperation  between  central  city  and
suburban municipal govern ments is crucial.26

Devel op ing countries
In most devel op ing countries, urban trans port insti -
tutions and governance systems have been unable
to keep pace with growth in urban population and
mobility needs. The urban trans port sector is charac -
terized  by  its  rapid  motorization,  deﬁcient  public
trans port supply, informality in its mobility systems,
congestion, pollution and high trafﬁc fatalities – with
differentiated impacts, in different cities and between
trip-makers (according to income groups, gender, age,
disability and level of education).27

n Africa
In  most  of  Africa,  and  notwithstanding  positive 
devel op ments – such as the setting up the Executive
Council of Urban Transport in Dakar, Senegal (Box
9.1), the Lagos Metropolitan Area Transport Author-
ity  in  Nigeria  (Box  9.14),  and  the  introduction  of
coordinated urban mobility plans in South Africa28 –
poor coordination between the numerous institutions
in urban trans port prevail. This has led to problems
in devel op ing uniﬁed and integrated urban mobility
policies.  The  fact  that  (too)  many  ministries  are
involved in the urban trans port sector at the local
level contributes to actions that can prove contra -

dictory. There is also a widespread underfunding of
urban  public  trans port and  rarely  any  signiﬁcant
formal involvement of trans port users (or civil society)
in the governance of cities. This is reﬂective of the
widespread absence of decentralization in the trans -
port  sector,  which  remains  controlled  by  national
govern ments. In countries such as Senegal or Burkina
Faso, for example, urban trans port is not included
in  the  sectors  concerned  by  the  decentralization
process.29 In the case of Egypt, efforts to centralize
responsibilities  for  urban  trans port have  recently
taken place in greater Cairo where a Public Trans -
portation  Regulatory  Authority  was  established  by
presidential decree in 2012, to control all urban trans -
port modes in the city.30

n Latin America and the Caribbean
The  institutional  and  governance  frameworks  in 
the  ﬁeld  of  urban  land  use  and  trans port  in  Latin
America and the Caribbean are strongly inﬂuenced
by  those  of  developed  countries  (particularly, 
North America).31 Apart from some urban highway
investments, the major new institutional initiatives
in the region relate to efforts to formalize public trans -
port modes and to improve formal public trans port
services through the introduction of new BRT systems
and metro extensions. As noted in previous chapters,
‘cities  like  Curitiba,  Brazil,  have  a  long  history  in
implementing  innovative  and  integrated  forms  of
transport.  Bogotá  and  Medellin  in  Colombia  are
continuously  incorporating  new  and  increasingly
participative forms of trans port decisions’.32

However,  in  Santiago,  Chile,  ‘urban  trans -
portation is managed through a disparate and frag -
mented institutional framework, distributed among
public  institutions  of  distinct  levels  with  dis tinct
areas of responsibility . . . structured across . . . three
. . . levels of govern ment’ involving several agencies
at each level.33 Santiago’s 2000–2010 urban mobility
plan was prepared in response to this dis parate and

fragmented institutional set-up (Box 9.7). Comprised
of 12 programmes, one included the modernization
of the public trans port system and the coordination
and integration of decisions relating to urban devel -
op ment  and  trans port  –  known  as  Transantiago.34
This  programme  sought  the  creation  of  a  new
institutional, operational and legal frame work for an
urban public trans port system that restructured the
bus  network  on  a  trunk-feeder  basis.  It  was  not,
however, assigned the necessary executive powers,
nor was it adequately resourced.35

n Western Asia
The  institutional  and  governance  structures  for 
urban  trans port in  Western  Asia  are  as  diverse  as 
the different governance systems found there. Not -
withstanding the differences, ‘a decentralized model
of urban trans port governance appears to be emerging
. . .  throughout  the  region,  as  a  result  of  recent
decentralization  reforms  related  to  rapid  urban -
ization’.36

Oil-rich countries, including the Gulf States and
Saudi Arabia, confront urban land-use and trans port
devel op ments  spawned  by  dramatic  increases  in
afﬂu ence.  This  wealth  has  enabled  their  govern -
ments to develop urban transportation systems sim-
ilar to those found in developed countries. This has
been accompanied by the establishment of some well-
resourced, sophisticated new institutional and govern -
ment  frameworks  for  urban  mobility,  such  as  the
Urban Planning Council in the United Arab Emirates.
Populous  countries,  such  as  Turkey  and  Iran,  are
much  less  well-resourced.  They  have  weaker  and
more stressed institutional capacities. Poorer coun -
tries, such as Yemen, have inadequately developed
institutions for urban mobility, more akin to those
of  the  poorer  parts  of  South  Asia  or  Sub-Saharan
Africa.37

Within Western Asia, it is common that com -
petition  or  rivalry  prevail  between  govern ment
agencies responsible for different aspects of urban
trans port and  land-use  devel op ment.  A  frequent
response  to  such  challenges  is  for  govern ment  to

create independent public agencies devoted to the
planning  and  delivery  of  projects.  In  Istanbul,  for
example,  there  are  several  such  dedicated  urban
trans port authorities whose responsibilities are not
well integrated and often compete.38

n South Asia
The  institutional  frameworks  for  urban  trans port
and  land-use  devel op ment  in  cities  of  South  Asia
generally exhibit a strong multi-tier set of national,
regional  and  local  govern ment  plus  quasi-govern -
ment  institutions,  accompanied  by  a  signiﬁcant
growth  of  private-sector  trans port  operators  and
investors. With fast-growing demand for urban mobil -
ity in the region, trans port institutions in cities face
a host of challenges (Box 9.2). Such institutions are
largely geared to address formal trafﬁc and trans port
concerns, leaving informal and non-motorized modes
to fend for themselves.39 The lateral links between
the institutions – in functional as well as geographical
terms – are typically poor compared to their vert-
ical institutional links. So much so, that ‘it is being
increasingly realized that the gap between planning
and implementation can not be bridged without the
institutional  reorganization,  capacity  building  and
streamlining of the procedures’.40

However,  in  several  Indian  cities  –  including
Delhi,  Mumbai,  Jaipur,  Hyderabad,  Chennai  and
Bangalore  –  uniﬁed  metropolitan  trafﬁc  and  trans-
port  authorities  have  been  set  up  (Figure  9.1).41

Planning and Design for Sustainable Urban Mobility

These  have  been  introduced  to  promote  a  more
effec tive  response  to  city  trans port  and  related 
land-use  challenges.  There  has  been  much  less
success to ration alize urban trans port institutions and
governance in other countries in South Asia.

n South-Eastern Asia
South-Eastern Asia presents a very mixed picture in
terms of institutional devel op ment and governance
for urban transport. This is due to the very different
forms and levels of govern ments that prevail, their
different colonial histories and subsequent evolution
of their political processes.42 It is, however, common
that  many  of  the  responsibilities  related  to  urban
movement in the region are entrusted to a range of
different national ministries, as in the case of Jakarta,
Indonesia.43

In Thailand and the Philippines, strong regional
political  differences  complicate  the  situation  for
trans port  ministries  attempting  to  work  with  city
govern ments.  Manila’s  institutional  arrangements
have remained virtually unchanged for generations.

Box 9.3 The Land Trans port Authority of Singapore

Established in 1995, the Land Transport Authority is responsible for planning, policy
and regulation of all urban trans port modes in Singapore. This made Singapore one of
the pioneers of integrating many urban trans port responsibilities within one
organization. The Land Transport Authority also constructs and maintains roads, the
metro system and other public trans port infra struc ture, in accordance with the
provisions of the concept plans.

is  responsible  for  devel op ment  planning,  trans -
portation and trafﬁc management, as well as urban
renewal and land-use planning, it does not have full
jurisdiction for the trans port sector.44

In terms of possessing institutional arrangements
that  enhance  the  integration  of  land  use  and
transportation, as well as the integration of modes
within  the  trans port  sector,  Singapore  is  perhaps 
the exception in South-Eastern Asia. Much of the
effectiveness of this integration ‘is greatly assisted
by [Singapore’s] two key agencies for planning and
policy, namely: the [Urban Regional Authority] . . .
for spatial devel op ment and land use, and the [Land
Transport Authority] . . . for all modes of transport’45
(Box 9.3).

n Eastern Asia
In  Eastern  Asia,  the  inﬂuence  of  the  strong  insti -
tutional  and  governance  frameworks  for  urban
mobility  in  Hong  Kong  and  Singapore  has  been
particularly  noticeable  in  mainland  China.46 Table 
9.1 summarizes three main institutional models for
the  management  of  urban  mobility  in  mainland 
China.

Strong  political  support  for  key  urban  trans -
portation projects has helped achieve some aspects
of long-term policy-making and planning in China.
Tensions, however, exist in some instances between
central and local interests, as well as between public
and private sector interests. On occasion, these have
prevented the emergence of an integrated institu -
tional approach to land-use and trans port devel op -
ment.47

With the increasing technical sophistication of
local  professional  cadres  there  are  several  prom-

ising  innovations  in  urban-mobility  planning  in 
China.  Shanghai  exempliﬁes  this  with  its  rational-
iza tion of urban land-use and mobility management
structures. Here urban trans port and related land-use
devel op ment  functions  are  divided  among  three
departments: the Urban Planning Bureau; the Urban-
Rural Con struction and Transport Committee; and 
the Trafﬁc Police Headquarters (Figure 9.2). Rail and
water  trans port  –  which  are  highly  signiﬁcant  in
most Chinese cities – however, are usually outside
of city control and are administered regionally or at
the state level.48

CHALLENGES AND
UNDERLYING INFLUENCES
This  section  describes  the  main  challenges  and
underlying  inﬂuences  related  to  urban  trans port
institutions and governance worldwide. These have
been organized below under four main categories,
namely challenges of adaptation; administration and
governance;  mobility  policy,  plan-making,  manage -
ment and regulation; and resourcing and capacity-
building. Even though the challenges are presented
below as separate themes, it is important to appre -
ciate the interconnectivity among them. For example,
the challenge posed by fragmented decision-making
applies virtually across all themes.

Adaptation challenges
There is a slow-growing acceptance among govern -
ments (and many other stakeholders) of the need
to  change institutions  and  governance  if  sus tain-
able mobility goals are to be delivered. The accept-
ance of this need for transformation varies greatly in
different  cultural  and  devel op ment  contexts,  and
between countries, cities, as well as different levels
of govern ment. There are, however, major deﬁ cien -
cies in the establishment of this capacity for change,

and  in  understanding  how  to  change.  The  trans -
formation  implies  embracing  a  broad  deﬁnition  of
‘governance’  and  managing  the  demand  for  move -
ment  that  favours  vulnerable  and  dis advan taged
groups and the environ ment.49

The  increased  globalization  and  politici -
zation  of  the  environ mental debate brings
challenges that can have major local manifestations.
Where  manifestations  are  negative  this  generates
tensions,  which  have  inﬂuenced  the  thinking  of
many urban mobility stakeholders, as well as those
engaged in urban land-use policy and planning. There
are  many  examples  of  urban  transportation  policy
documents that express what changes need to occur
and how ‘smart growth’ can propel more sus tain able
urban mobility planning.50 The degree to which this
has resulted in action, however, has been limited due
to the resistance to change within many institutions.
Successful implementation of programmes based on
more  holistic  thinking  typically  requires  strong
political leadership. Without such leadership, aspira -
tions of more holistic thinking tend to ﬂounder.51

There  is  increasing  recognition  that  the  inte -
gration  of  land-use  and  trans port  planning is
necessary to ensure the efﬁciency of urban mobility
systems.52 However, it is important to recognize the
commonalities  as  well  as  differences  between  the
nature and roles of participants in both ﬁelds, as well
as the limits to integration possible between the two
(Box 9.4).53 The issue is not so much the difference
in perspective, but rather the inﬂuence and power
that accompanies these perspectives and their ability
to affect outcomes. Consultations in land-use devel -
op ments are more about proposed one-time changes
of use, whereas changes to urban mobility tend to
take place on a continuous basis. Land-use planning
may, as a result, require structural changes in institu -
tional and governance frameworks of a more perm -
anent kind than for urban transportation.54

Box 9.4 Key challenges in integrated land-use and trans port planning

As transportation is a function of land use, one way of
effectively reducing urban movement is by imposing tighter
land-use controls and increasing densities. There are, 
however, a number of problems that can prevent this from
materializing:

• Many agencies that inﬂuence and/or regulate land use have
little or no responsibility for mobility policies. The result is
a serious institutional ‘land-use/transportation disconnect’
that prevents integrative actions, especially in cities that
have a weak tradition of urban land-use planning and
control.
The skill-sets required by the two principal professions
involved are very different and employ very different

•

premises and logic. Obliging these professions to 
employ more joined-up thinking, as required in transit-
orientated devel op ment projects, is a good way of
achieving this.

• Competitive forces among cities often have one city

pitching against another, encouraging ‘sweetener deals’ 
to potential major investors in the form of exceptions 
and leniency in land-use policies and devel op ment 
control.

• Urban growth can prove impervious to local public

policies.

Planning and Design for Sustainable Urban Mobility

processes  are  generally  less  well  developed,55
there is typically a lack of consultation in both urban
land-use and mobility planning. There is, nonethe-
less, an increased understanding of the close links
between urban mobility and land-use planning as a
result of the land-value impact of trans port infra struc -
ture on land use.56 These circumstances call for a
more holistic approach to urban mobility planning,
irrespective of cultural and devel op ment contexts.

Administrative and governance
challenges
As earlier indicated, democratization, privatization
and  decentralization have  been  the  three  main
challenges  to  the  institutional  changes  occurring 
in Eastern Europe during the last two decades.57 The
abandonment  or  gradual  dismantling  of  previous
centralized decision-making and planning has trans -
formed  the  functions  of  many  key  transportation
infra struc tures and services. Meanwhile, the earlier
dominance of public trans port over private car use
has  been  reversed.  This  has  spawned  new  urban -
ization and motorization challenges at a scale not seen
before. Similar devel op ments can also be found in
some  devel op ing  countries.  This  has  brought  new
challenges  reﬂecting  changes  in  the  types  and
inﬂuences of stakeholders involved in urban infra -
struc ture devel op ments and provision of trans port
services. Together with the advance of privatization
and neoliberal inﬂuences, such devel op ments have
produced more complex institutional decision-making
arrangements, particularly with regard to trans port
infra struc ture  and  service  investment  deliveries
associated  with  private-ﬁnance  initiatives  and
public–private partnerships.58

Urban growth generally results in cities spilling
over beyond their original administrative boundaries
– absorbing neigh bouring settlements in a greater
metropolitan  area.  The  discussion  in  the  previous
section  illustrates  the  complications  associated
with  urban  administrative  boundaries,  when 
rail- and road-based trans port services extend well
beyond city boundaries into their hinterland as inter -
city carriers for passen gers and goods. Thus decision-
making is not only fragmented as a result overlap-
ping  institutional  responsibilities;  it  also  faces 
major  challenges  in  terms  of  horizontal  coordina-
tion  between  lower  tier  govern ments  and,  more
signiﬁ cantly, in terms of vertical integration.59 The
identiﬁ cation of a lead authority to provide strategic
direction in decision-making is thus a pre-requisite
of coordinated action.

Changes in organizational arrangements of
agencies are  frequently  made  to  address  urban
mobility  challenges.  Such  changes  are  particularly
made when a new administration comes to power,
either at the national or municipal level. These chan -
ges, however, have too often acquired a reputation for

doing  little  more  than  ‘moving  the  boxes  around’ 
on an organizational chart and renaming them. This
negative  perception  of  organizational  reform  can 
be attributed to: a failure to improve organizational
culture; a failure in business processes; and a failure
in staff skills devel op ment. To achieve effective organ -
izational change, all three need to be tackled together.
Of  all  challenges  confronted  by  efforts  to
promote  integrated  urban  land-use  and  mobility
planning, perhaps the most corrosive is a bias against
integrated planning and management. This bias
is encountered within many institutions (both public
and  private).  While  it  is  apparent  that  joined-up
think ing and actions are prerequisites to the success -
ful  pursuit  of  sus tain able devel op ment  outcomes,
there  is  growing  evidence  to  suggest  that  severe
tensions emerge in contexts that also promote neo -
liberal  free  market  ‘solutions’  to  public  domain
problems.  This  is  because  free-market  advocates
frequently  view  integrated  planning  and  manage-
ment  as  synonymous  to  top-down  comprehensive
planning  and  management  –  which  restricts  inno -
vation  and  is  potentially  wasteful  due  to  its  non-
competitive high transaction costs.

Mobility policy, plan-making, management
and regulatory challenges
The main streaming of the mobility needs of the
socially  and  economically  dis advan taged is  a
major challenge, and includes gender concerns, as
well as the needs of the disabled, the elderly,
children  and  youth.60 As  noted  in  Chapter  6, 
the challenges relate to their dependence on non-
motor ized  movement,  their  restricted  access  to
motorized  public  and  private  trans port (especially 
on grounds of affordability and their capacity restric -
tions), their vul nerability to trafﬁc accidents, and other
safety and security concerns. Addressing these issues
requires extensive investigations to better ascertain
the nature, distribution and scale of these concerns,
to provide a basis for deciding how best to improve
the  future  design,  management  and  delivery  of 
public  trans port services,  including  for  security
enforce ment.

The  issue  of  how  best  to  plan,  manage,
operate and regulate urban public trans port –
and  the  extent  this  involves  enterprise  operator
functions for building the needed roads or railways
or operating buses – is a major international chal -
lenge, especially where non-nationalized models of
public trans port governance exist. Some stakeholders
advocate that these enterprises must over time be
transformed into self-sustaining businesses operating
on commercial lines.61 Other stakeholders, however,
do not consider it desirable (or inevitable) that public
trans port should always be commercially operated,
and  look  to  a  more  welfare-orientated  approach
instead.62

In addition to the kinds of formal urban public
trans port systems  referred  to  above,  informal 
public trans port services ply the roads of many (if
not  most)  cities  of  devel op ing  countries.  While 
some urban institutional arrangements show some
accom modation toward informal sector operators, the
culture  of  city  ofﬁcials  throughout  devel op ing
countries is typically dismissive of informal modes
of mobility. This is despite the widespread prevalence
of poverty in cities with a large majority of inhabitants
for whom these modes of travel are vital.63

Freight movement is critical to the economies
of all cities. There is thus an ongoing call for increased
private investments to address the needs of freight
movement, in terms of infra struc ture and operations.
Although signiﬁcant world-wide, such investment is
particularly  important  for  cities  with  major  ports
and/or airline hubs in devel op ing countries and coun -
tries  with  economies  in  transition,  where  global -
ization  has  opened  up  many  new  opportunities.
Private  investment  in  freight  movement  has  seen
major  devel op ments  in  information  and  communi -
cations technologies, which in turn have spawned
dramatic changes to logistic services in the continued
search to reduce costs.

A  major  challenge  to  freight  movement  in
metropolitan areas of devel op ing countries has to do
with  the  location  of  logistics  facilities,  and  the
unpredictability of changes to land uses resulting from
the absence of land-use zoning protection of exist-
ing  logistic  centres.  This  has  led  many  freight
companies  to  move  their  logistic  facilities  to  the
periphery,  where  land  is  cheaper  and  more  freely
available.64 Such devel op ments have contributed to
a  growing  ‘logistics  sprawl’  of  freight  logistic  and
distribution centres.

Challenges  of  multi-modal  integration are
numerous and varied in urban areas globally. They
are exceedingly important with respect to provision
of efﬁcient public trans port and freight movement.
A  common  challenge  for  urban  institutions  is  the
integration of the planning, management and opera -
tion  of  railways  with  road-based  public  trans port
services and other trafﬁc. A larger challenge for fast-
growing cities in devel op ing countries is the more
urgent task of facilitating convenient rail-road inter -
changes for peak commuter journeys and ensuring
integration of fares.

Inter-agency collaboration among the organ -
izations responsible for the planning, management
and operation of various urban modes of trans port –
and the city planning organizations responsible for
land devel op ments – is also essential. Establishing
such  collaboration  is  among  the  most  funda-
mental  challenges  for  municipal  and  govern ment
authorities, especially where silo-thinking too often
prevails.

There is a clear need to main stream environ -
mental concerns65 in  institutional  and  govern-

Institutions and Governance for Urban Mobility

183

ance frameworks for urban mobility.66 Transport and
non-trans port engineering and environ mental depart -
ments tend to compete over resources, funding and
for  pre-eminence  within  governance  structures.
While the main streaming of trans port disciplines is
a useful premise within organizational restructuring,
the trans port department is often part of a bigger
engineering or environ mental department that has
other priorities to balance. In practice, trans port is
often  given  greater  importance  where  there  are
particular  pressures  on  the  availability  or  value  of 
land  that  constrain  the  distribution  of  people  and
jobs/goods/services.

Resourcing and capacity-building
challenges
Perhaps the most pervasive challenge for urban trans -
port institutions globally is the lack of sustained
funding  for  transportation  infra struc ture  and
services – not least for the institutional infra struc -
ture. Combined with a poor understanding of urban
economics and the complex interplay between infra -
struc ture  investment,  land-use  planning  and  the
value that the ‘public good’ of efﬁcient mobility can
provide, these challenges together can pose ‘wicked
problems’.67 As noted in Chapter 8, cities can be self-
ﬁnancing in transportation and other essential infra -
struc ture  if  economic  rent  from  land  value-added
through investment in infra struc ture is captured by
the city and ‘recycled’.68 However, few cities come
close to practising the theory. As a result, cities are
forced to develop plans for public trans port improve -
ments that depend overwhelmingly on the fare box
to ﬁnance ﬁxed assets.

The  devel op ment  of  information  and
communications technologies69 can enhance the
performance  of  the  urban  transportation  sector. 
The fast-changing world of such technologies offers
numerous  possibilities  –  primarily  through  the
internet and mobile communication – to help address
the  current  lack  of  sustained  funding  for  urban
transportation infra struc ture and services (Box 9.5).
These tools, however, are too often poorly under -
stood  and/or  present  numerous  technological  and
funding  challenges  (especially  initially)  to  many
conventional civic institutions, particularly in devel -
op ing countries.

This  remains  an  important  challenge  as  the
opportunity costs of not employing such tools mount.
In recognition of the potential for urban trans port
institutions  of  information  and  communications
technologies,  the  United  Nations  has  sought  to
promote tools that can monitor urban land and infra -
struc ture devel op ments (including land values) so as
to enhance the ability of govern ment decision-makers
to  better  plan,  manage  and  ﬁnance  future  urban
devel op ment  as  part  of  online  capacity-building
efforts.70

Planning and Design for Sustainable Urban Mobility

Box 9.5 The potential of social media and open source material

The evolving frontier of web 2.0, social media, open source
material and volunteered geographic information needs to be
considered, addressed and potentially embraced with respect
to the devel op ment of urban mobility systems. Until relatively
recently, the public sector, the private sector, or a partnership
between the two, were responsible for planning, design,
implementation and operation of urban mobility systems, with
civil society actors being consulted at times as a routine part 
of the process of planning or implementation. Engineers,
planners, bankers, architects and urban designers were the
‘professionals’ whose expertise informed transportation
efforts.

Today, however, civil society groups and individuals are

vocal advocates for, and increasingly consider themselves to be
‘experts’ in, sus tain able mobility efforts. While geospatial
mobility and logistics data are largely proprietary in nature,
civil society groups and individuals request and sometimes
demand access to govern ment-owned data sets. Further more,
crowd-sourced and/or volunteered geographic information
data sets are now emerging as open source alternatives to
proprietary and private data, and are increasingly seen as

having the potential to enhance the sus tain ability of urban
mobility systems.

Open source material is currently being used for non-
motorized vehicle mobility planning in many cities around the
world to expand infra struc ture for walking and cycling and to
improve the conditions and connectivity of existing networks.
Further more, groups such as ‘seeclickﬁx.com’ crowd-source
tips on problems that need ﬁxing in communities (including
mobility-related issues) and then direct feedback and
comments to local govern ments or agencies with the power
to ﬁx these problems. Likewise, mobile applications such as
‘Moovit’ help riders make public-trans port system-access
decisions based on crowd-sourced data about system
effectiveness, efﬁciency and temporary problems that might
cause delays or disruptions. Moreover, the World Bank, in
partnership with federal and local transportation agencies in
the Philippines, is piloting an open data system of public trans -
port routes, schedules and fares.

When training and
capacity-building
are provided as
part of foreign aid
technical
assistance,
participants are
frequently not up
to the required
level to receive
the course, nor
are they originally
trained/educated
to work in the
ﬁeld of their
employment

Institutional capacity-building and training
of  staff in  the  urban  trans port sector  are  always
critical, regardless of the level of devel op ment and
the gender of trainee.71 These efforts are frequently
required for pilots of new planning and management
processes, so that teething troubles and difﬁculties
can be resolved before moving to their widespread
introduction.

Institutional capacity-building typically seeks to
address issues raised at the local level. In so doing,
it  frequently  includes:  the  training  of  local  pro -
fessional  and  technical  staff,  as  well  as  political
leaders;  facilitating  political–professional  dialogue;
enhancing  communications  of  the  public  sector 
with the private sector; and improving govern ment
dialogue  with  local  communities  and  the  non-
govern ment sector.

Cities  in  devel op ing  countries  and  countries
with  economies  in  transitions  have  additional 
capacity  concerns  –  related  to  a  backlog  of  long-
term  and  structural  institutional-capacity  short-
ages.72 It should be noted that many deprived cities
in developed countries as well are in need of such
attention.  Both  contexts  confront  institutional
capacity-building  challenges  with  regard  to  the
introduction of new approaches and tools, many of
which  are  increasingly  based  on  information  and
communications  tech nologies.  They  are  also  con -
fronted  with  challenges  associated  with  the
introduction  of  a  more  holistic  understanding  of

trans port and urban devel op ment, as in the case of
efforts to operationalize the sus tain ability vision in
the urban trans port sector.

At  the  international  level,  enhanced  global
information and communications technologies now
facilitate knowledge-sharing and lesson-learning not
only from developed to devel op ing countries, but also
between devel op ing countries.73 The challenge here
is in making judgements about the appropriateness
of the knowledge acquired/shared from an overseas
source to one’s own devel op mental circumstances
and aspirations.

However, it should be noted that when training
and capacity-building are provided as part of foreign
aid technical assistance, participants are frequently
not up to the required level to receive the course,
nor are they originally trained/educated to work in
the ﬁeld of their employment. Further more, in many
instances, particularly in devel op ing countries, it is
the  wrong  individuals  that  are  being  trained.  The 
ones invited for training courses are not the ones that
are  actually  doing  the  work;  and  in  some  cases
(particularly  when  funded  by  overseas  agencies),
attendance  on  training  courses  is  seen  as  a  fringe
beneﬁt  and  a  means  to  access  travel,  extra  allow-
ances,  etc.  Moreover,  course  organizers  are  fre -
quently  not  aware  of  the  realities  of  the  working
environ ments of the trainees and the training course
is often inadequately designed to meet the real needs
of the participants.74

POLICY RESPONSES AND
INNOVATIVE AND
‘SUCCESSFUL’ PRACTICES
This section presents a selection of innovative and
successful institutional and governance responses to
many  of  the  challenges  discussed  in  the  previous
section. It should be stressed, however, that each
example cited does not necessarily incorporate all
facets  of  good  practice,  more  likely  only  selected
dimensions.

Integrated urban land-use and mobility
planning
It is often argued that integration – in terms of land-
use  and  trans port  planning  and/or  intermodal
integration – can only be achieved if the agencies
responsible  are  themselves  integrated  into  one
agency. However, in the case of Singapore, the mech -
anism of cross-agency committees is used instead.
This has been successful as ‘the Singapore Govern -
ment as a whole is relatively integrated, with less of
the  departmental  silos  culture  frequently  seen  in
other national and city govern ments’ in the region.75
The integration is also achieved by virtue of a large
percentage of its land being in govern ment owner -
ship. This permits the Singapore govern ment to ‘use
land release strategically as a proactive means to guide
the implementation of [its] Concept and Land Use
Plans’ and for any other uses deemed to be in the
public beneﬁt.76 These arrangements facilitate the
acquisition  of  land  around  metro  stations  before
construction. Singapore’s metro system has attracted
70 per cent of trips of all motorized modes within
25 years of its inauguration in 1987. This represents
a major achievement that has been largely attributed
to its effective institutional and governance arrange -
ments.77

The integration of urban land-use and mobility
planning  functions  is  also  well  reﬂected  in  other
countries. In the city of Seoul (Republic of Korea)

for example, the institutional structure for land use
and trans port is directed by the mayor, with trans -
portation responsibilities overseen by a vice mayor
(who heads the City Transportation Headquarters)
and  land-use  planning  overseen  by  another  vice
mayor (who heads the Urban Planning Bureau). The
mayor has an additional third arm of governance (the
Management and Planning Ofﬁce) that oversees and
looks to manage and plan the integrative aspects of
both.78 In Japan, the national and regional institu -
tional structure is especially conducive to the devel -
op ment of rail-orientated urban devel op ment.79 This
falls under the overall responsibility of the Ministry
of  Infra struc ture,  Transport  and  Tourism,  which
includes  ﬁve  departments  responsible  for  urban
transport, including the Railway Bureau.80

In  Canada,  the  regional  governance  models 
that facilitated the set-up of the TransLink in Van -
couver;81 the  transportation  arms  of  the  Capital
Region Board in Edmonton;82 and Metrolinx for the
Greater  Toronto  and  Hamilton  Area83 have  been
applauded. All of these authorities ‘encourage region-
wide  coordination  of  land-use  and  transportation
planning  and  decision-making’.84 This  includes
attempts to coordinate and integrate different modes
of transport.85

The city of Nantes in France is at the forefront
of sus tain able mobility planning. This is largely due
to  its  long-term  vision  and  commitment  to  an
integrated approach to urban planning and trans port
over some 30 years (Box 9.6).86 Nantes’ approach to
provide an integrated network of multi-modal trans -
port services has, to some extent, helped the city
manage the growth of private car use, simultaneously
retaining a high level of mobility for its citizens and
preserving their quality of life. The city is also a good
example of how an employer tax on public trans port
provision  (versement  transport)  has  been  widely
employed across France.87 The city has further more
been a pioneer in drawing up urban mobility plans.88
The latest of these (2010–2020) ‘sets out trans port
policy for the next ten years and thematic action plans
are  elaborated  on  topics  such  as  public  transport, 

Box 9.6 Main causes for the sus tain able mobility planning achievements of Nantes, France

The achievements are attributed to the city administration’s:

•
•

•

long-term city-wide vision and strategy;
competence across required areas to enable integration
of decisions and actions to implement (i.e. pricing and
availability of parking, integrated ticketing, infra struc ture,
etc.);
ability to build consensus with surrounding
municipalities, gain political support and implement
integrated policies and plans, gaining the advantages of a
wide service area;

•

•

capability to make intelligent choices regarding: the
integration of modes and the use of a wider set of mobility
possibilities over and above the car, including bike-sharing,
car-pooling and walking options (such as pedestrian-only
zones);
sustained investment in quality infra struc ture and
vehicles, thus providing attractive alternatives to private
car use;
provision of a high-quality public trans port service at
an affordable price.

Privatization, decentralization and
centralization
In Chile, and in some other South American coun -
tries, there is evidence that greater awareness of the
rights of urban residents can positively inﬂuence the
governance  structures  of  urban  transportation.
Citizen  participation  has  played  a  role  (to  varying
degrees) in a number of major urban public trans -
port devel op ments in the region, including the Trans -
Milenio (Box  7.7  and  Box  9.12)  and  Tran santiago
projects. The characteristics of the innovative insti -
tutional  framework  established  for  the  latter  are
outlined in Box 9.7. Notwithstanding the innovative
ideas  behind  this  initiative,  however,  it  has  been
argued that the resultant institutional archi tecture
has become weak and predominantly reactive rather
than proactive, with decisions taken mainly by central
govern ment. This has partly been explained by the
fact that there is no mayor with jurisdiction over all
districts of the city and that Transantiago staff are
not public ofﬁcials, and mainly work on short-term
contracts with no clear individual responsi bilities.90
The institutional and governance framework for
urban trans port in Barcelona, Spain, is innovative in
that it allows a mix of public and private public trans -
port operators to operate in the metropolitan area.
Apart from cities in Scandinavia, Barcelona is one of
the few cities in Europe where public and private
operators  coexist  within  the  same  jurisdiction. 
Such ‘mixed systems’ are believed to be capable of
increasing competition in the local market, providing
better information on costs, and ensuring that govern -

ments can guarantee a fail-safe service or reverse its
privatization decision if contracts fail. Under these
arrangements, Barcelona has made it possible to out-
source bus services in certain municipalities, even
though the transportation authorities in the centre
of Barcelona have chosen to retain delivery of their
services. The main shortcoming of this model, how -
ever, is that the public trans port provider (Transports
Metropolitans de Barcelona) retains a great deal of
autonomy from the regulator (Metropolitan Entity of
Transport), which makes it difﬁcult to regulate the
former.91

Barcelona is also providing a good example of 
how  to  enhance  public  participation,  with  its
‘mobility pact’ between the main stakeholders in the
trans port sector (Box 9.8). This initiative has since
been copied in a number of other cities. Barcelona’s
mobility pact encourages participation by all actors in
the ﬁeld of urban mobility in Barcelona, and related
activities are canalized in both formal and informal
ways. Several newspapers do for example publish daily
columns on mobility-related problems in the section
on ‘letters from our readers’, often with a photo, with
an oppor tunity for the responsible institution(s) to
respond.

The city of Amman, Jordan, provides an example
of a successful decentralized model of institutional
devel op ment and governance for the urban trans port
sector,  due  to  its  multi-stakeholder  structure.92
The  Greater  Amman  Municipality  is  responsible 
for policies and transportation system stewardship.
At  the  national  level,  the  Ministry  of  Transport  is
responsible for all intermediate and long-term plans
and studies, while the Public Transport Regulatory
Commission is responsible for public transportation.
This Commission is afﬁliated with the Ministry of

Box 9.7 Institutional framework for urban mobility in Santiago de Chile

This institutional framework for Santiago de Chile has the
following characteristics:

•

Profound political, economic and regulatory changes
(particularly in terms of liberalization and privatization)
in national governance that have taken place since the
1970s have greatly limited the role of govern ment in urban
services provision.

• A wide-ranging approach to the improvement of public

transportation has included new regulations for the bus
system with respect to, among other things, its levels of
service.

• An extensive construction programme of urban and

•

suburban highways has been delivered via public–private
partnerships.
The city-wide Transantiago programme introduced a bus
rapid trans port system that has become a centrepiece of
integrating the city’s overall public trans port system.

• Although there has been strong technical and institutional
capacity-building within the involved organizations, the
accumulated experi ence has unfortunately not resulted in
entirely successful implementation. This is primarily
attributed to limitations within the institutions involved
and issues of governance relating to, among other 
things, the integration of land-use and urban trans port
devel op ments.
There is an almost total compartmentalization between
organizations in the city, leading to problems of
coordination. This has limited the institutional capacity 
for integrated management in urban trans port and land
use. It has also encouraged a tendency toward ‘reactive
management’ providing a context where decisions are
predominantly taken by a national authority.

Box 9.8 Social participation in decision-making: The ‘mobility pact’ in Barcelona, Spain

In 1998, the City of Barcelona deﬁned a ‘mobility pact’ among
its 62 mobility-related stakeholders (i.e. users, operators,
manufacturers, providers, etc.). What started as media-
oriented performance and a ‘politically correct’ initiative has
turned out to be a great tool to reach agreements and
consensus about priorities for how to use the city’s limited
street space. The initiative involves thematic meetings, two
annual general meetings (with the presence of the mayor) and
follow-up of key performance indicators.

The ‘ten commandments’ of the mobility pact are:

1. High-quality, integrated public transport.
2. Maintain trafﬁc speeds and improve the speed of surface

public transport.

3. Increase the surface area and quality for pedestrian use.

4. Increase the number of parking spaces and improve their

quality.

5. Improve citizens’ information and road signals and signs.
6. Legal regulations to be suited to the mobility of the city of

Barcelona.

7. Improve road safety and respect among users of various

trans port modes.

8. Less polluting fuels, and reduce air and noise pollution

caused by trafﬁc.

9. Promote the use of bicycles.
10. Efﬁcient and orderly distribution of goods and products

throughout the city.

Box 9.9  Institutional devel op ments for urban mobility in Hanoi, Viet Nam

The positive aspects of institutional devel op ment and
governance in Hanoi include:

However, a number of issues still remain to be addressed,
including:

• The creation of a single local govern ment area by the

extension of the administrative boundary to create a
‘Greater Hanoi’, which includes all areas likely to undergo
urbanization up to 2050.

• The establishment of a Department of Transport by

bringing together most functions of urban trans port within
Greater Hanoi in a single agency.

•
•

•

•

adopting enabling legislation for decentralization;
undertaking institutional devel op ment of the Department
of Transport;
providing resources for training and capacity building in the
trans port sector;
establishing a more integrated sector-wide approach to
meet the challenges facing trans port institutions.

• The introduction of strategic planning, thus reﬂecting

the decision of the central govern ment to decentralize
responsibility for the preparation of construction master
plans for Hanoi.

• The intention to establish a public trans port authority

to be responsible for all aspects of public trans port in
Hanoi, and to undertake studies to clarify the roles and
responsibilities of this authority.

Transport but has its own ﬁnan cial and administrative
independence.93

In contrast, a centralized model of institutional
devel op ment and governance for urban trans port is
showing promise in Viet Nam. A relatively simple line
of authority between national and local govern ment
has  helped  the  establishment  of  strong  city-wide
trans port authorities of the kind recently proposed
for Hanoi (Box 9.9). The city offers good illustrations
of progress toward good practice (albeit slowly) in
institutional devel op ment and governance in urban
trans port policy-making, land-use/trans port strategic
planning  and  in  public  trans port planning  and
management.

Addressing urban boundary
complications
As  noted  earlier  in  this  chapter,  Auckland,  New
Zealand, has recently seen the implementation of a
far-reaching reorganization of its governing structure.
As a result, a new council-controlled organization,
Auckland Transport, was established in November
2010, working under the new amalgamated Auckland
Council. The new organization combines the exper -
tise and functions of eight former local and regional
councils and a regional trans port authority (ARTA).
All trans port functions and operations in Auckland
are  now  the  responsibility  of  one  organization.94
The establishment of Auckland Trans port assumes
that ‘the Long-Term Council Com munity Plan and
District Plan will continue to guide Auckland Council

decision-making, pending decisions on a spatial plan
and  infra struc ture  investment  plan.’  These  new
arrangements anticipate that ‘local boards will have
an advisory role in identifying local service needs and
a budget for planning and ‘place-shaping’.95

The decision that the local authority trans port
network  for  Auckland  is  best  managed  as  a  single
network by Auckland Transport was premised on the
belief that it will provide a level of focus that could
not be provided by the full Auckland Council with
its  multiplicity  of  responsibilities.  The  governance
framework  allocates  the  main  trans port  roles  to
Auckland  Transport  with  Auckland  Council  being
responsible  for  its  long-term  council  community
plan. This establishes council trans port funding for
the Auckland Transport, while the Auckland regional
land  trans port  strategy  sets  out  the  trans port
outcomes that the region wishes to achieve over a
30-year period. Under these arrangements, Auckland
Transport is responsible for planning and delivering
local ‘roads and footpaths . . . parking and train, bus
and ferry services’,96 including the preparation of the
Auckland regional land trans port programme, which
sets out the trans port projects anticipated over the
next three years.

Continued urban growth in Stockholm, Sweden,
has provided the impetus for the formation of a single
regional trans port body, Storstockholms Lokaltraﬁk
in 1967. This agency assumed the public trans port
responsibilities that had been previously distributed
among individual municipalities. The integration of
services and tariffs was a primary goal of this institu -
tion – with bus, metro, regional rail, and ferry services
all procured for the city by Storstockholms Lokaltraﬁk.
Owned  by  the  Stockholm  City  Council,  Storstock -
holms  Lokaltraﬁk is  the  parent  company  for  four
operating companies, two dormant subsidiaries and
six associated companies. The organization’s activities
include providing:97

• an operational ‘overview’ of the region’s public

trans port system and services;

• an overall service quality of the region’s public
trans port system  and  simultaneously  being
responsible for the supervision of maintenance;

• initiatives for the devel op ment of the system;
• services for the purchases and procurements of

the region’s public trans port system.

Mobility policy, plan-making and
management
The State of Victoria, Australia, offers a good example
of promoting institutional system integration and sus -
tain ability  for  urban  mobility  through  its  recent
legislative reforms spawned by the State of Victoria
Transport Integration Act of 2010.98 Whereas Vic -
toria’s urban trans port governance was in the past
dispersed  among  different  parties  with  differing
objectives and interests, preventing the recognition
of the interconnected nature of trans port and land
use, the Act provided a common state policy frame -
work. This framework seeks to:

• unify  all  elements  of  the  trans port  portfolio  to
ensure  that  trans port  agencies  work  together
towards an integrated and sus tain able trans port
system;

• recognize that the trans port system needs to be
sus tain able in both economic, social and environ -
mental terms;

• enable the trans port system to be conceived and
planned as a single system rather than as separate
or competing trans port modes;

• provide a universal framework for integrated and

sus tain able trans port policy and operations;

• integrate  land-use  and  trans port  planning  and
decision-making by extending the coverage of the
Act  to  land-use  agencies  whose  decisions  are
likely to have a signiﬁcant impact on the trans -
port system;

• align the charters of trans port agencies with the
overarching  policy  framework  to  increase  the
modal share of public transport.

Box 9.10 Climate change activity at the state level, US

State climate action plans: As of April 2010, 33 US states
had developed state climate action plans, with several others
in the process of doing so. Some have been formally adopted
by the respective governor or state legislature; others were
prepared as reports without any ofﬁcial action being taken.
Many state departments of trans port have developed
strategies or policies for implementing the transportation
elements of these plans. Yet others are taking a range of
additional actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

Local govern ment climate activities: Nearly 800 mayors
have signed the US Conference of Mayors Climate Protection

Agreement, agreeing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to at
least 7 per cent below 1990 levels by 2012.

Climate planning by metropolitan planning organizations:
Many metropolitan planning organizations, especially larger
ones, are analysing greenhouse gas emissions from
transportation in their metropolitan areas, devel op ing
transportation greenhouse gas inventories and baseline
protections, as well as identifying possible strategies to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions from transport.

Main streaming environ mental concerns
Although  the  Federal  Govern ment  of  US  has  not
enacted climate change legislation, there is a great
deal  of  climate  change  activity  at  the  level  of  the
states. These reveal signiﬁcant advances being made
that perhaps defy the international impression of the
US  federal  govern ment’s  negative  attitudes  to  the
climate change agenda (Box 9.10).

In  the  UK,  London  ‘considers  itself  an  exem-
plar in moving towards a low carbon economy’. It
views sus tain ability ‘primarily as an environ mental
quality with reductions in [carbon dioxide] and local
pollutants being the major objectives’.99 In order to
reduce  its  greenhouse  gas  emissions,  London  has
focused on ‘investment in higher density devel op -
ments and the use of trans port devel op ment areas
at  key  interchanges  that  are  public  trans port
accessible. It is now considering alternative fuels and
has taken the lead in investing in an electric vehicle
infra struc ture,  in  cycle  hire  schemes  and  in  cycle
highways’.100 Major infra struc ture investment is seen
as a signiﬁcant part of the Mayor’s 2010 Transport
Strategy, in order to enhance the capacity and con -
nectivity  of  the  capital’s  public  trans port system
following a history of underinvestment.101

Main streaming mobility needs of the
socially and economically dis advan taged
The  EU’s  plans  to  introduce  a  framework  for  the
preparation of urban mobility plans are among the
most innovative measures to promote institutional
devel op ment and governance within the urban trans -
port sector. This represents a major pan-European
effort at promoting walking, cycling and public trans -
port in  urban  areas.  The  European  Commission
recommends:102

• the  establishment  of  procedures  and  ﬁnan cial-
support  mechanisms  at  the  European  level  for
preparing urban mobility audits and urban mobility
plans;

• the examination of the possibility of a mandatory
approach to such plans for cities of a certain size;
• the  linking  of  EU  regional  devel op ment  and
cohesion  funds  to  cities  and  regions  that  have
submitted a current, and independently validated
‘urban  mobility  performance  and  sus tain ability
audit’ certiﬁcate;

• the examination of the possibility of a European
support  framework  for  a  progressive  imple -
mentation of urban mobility plans.

South  Africa’s  efforts  to  promote  urban  mobility
plans since 1999 do in some respects reﬂect these
devel op ments  in  Europe.103 The  ‘Moving  South
Africa’  Project  attempted  to  develop a  strategic
framework for trans port in the country. It called for
transparent decision-making, funding and pricing for

the trans port sector and looked to the reorientation
of trans port towards customer needs. The govern -
ment’s role was to provide a clear vision, the estab -
lishment of strong institutions, the setting of clear
rules for reinforcing the vision, the devel op ment of
human capacity, and the measuring and monitoring
of performance. The project considered customers
of  the  South  African  (urban) ‘trans port  system  to 
be  disempowered  and  weakly  organized’.  It  also 
con siders ‘the upgrading of customer power [as] a
precondition  for  improvement  to  the  trans port
system’.104

Another  innovative  international  measure  that 
has the potential to impact urban trans port institu -
tional devel op ment and governance is initiatives to
increase the engagement of youth. With this in mind,
the Youth for Public Transport Group was set up as 
part of UITP’s Youth Project.105 ‘The group was formed
to recognize innovative public trans port projects that
include youth and to start a dialogue between youth
groups and govern ment through more formal mech -
anisms so that young voices can be heard’.106 Yet,
another initiative in this area is the Tanzanian initiative
to introduce a regulatory frame work and a Consumer
Consultative Council to repre sent the interests of all
public  trans port users  (includ ing  the  disabled).107
Hong Kong, China, is already undertaking a system-
atic monitoring and enforcement, against very clear
require ments and goals with respect to the mobility
rights of the disabled.108

Addressing freight movement needs
The city of Paris has employed an explicit trans port
policy  for  freight  since  the  early  2000s,  and  has
promoted  a  Charter  for  freight  movement  (Box 
9.11). Notwithstanding some disappointments, ‘Paris
can be considered one of the most active European
cities in the ﬁeld of urban freight management’.109
Some ‘two-thirds of shipments coming in and going
out  of  the  metropolitan  area  of  Ile-de-France  go
through a regional terminal in order to be transhipped
and reorganised’,110 demonstrating the strategic role
of logistics terminals in large metropolitan areas.

The ‘National Programme for Freight in Cities’
established  by  the  French  Ministry  of  Transport 
in 1993 carried out surveys of freight movement in
France and established a database for urban freight
demand in the entire country. Based on this inform -
ation  it  built  a  simulation  model  of  future  move-
ments.  A  second  phase  of  the  surveys  started  in 
2010.  The  surveys  revealed  the  characteristics  of
‘logistics sprawl’ and that freight trans port generates
a  large  proportion  of  local  transport-based  pollu-
tion in Ile-de-France. As a result, in 2011 the city of 
Paris was designated as one of six ‘zones for priority’
to  address  air  pollution  produced  by  commercial
vehicles, targeting especially the restriction of access
by old commercial vehicles.111

Box 9.11 The Freight Charter, Paris, France

Since 2001, urban goods transport, long neglected in Paris’
mobility policies, has been brought to the municipal agenda as
part of a new approach in trans port planning, with the main
aim of alleviating the negative environ mental impacts of freight
movement.

In 2002 a consultation brought together the deputy

mayor with the various freight trans port stakeholders – as well
as rail operators, energy providers and other public agencies –
with a view to informing each other of their respective
challenges and priorities. In 2006, as a result of these
consultations, a Freight Charter was signed by all parties.
While not a legally binding document, it identiﬁed
commitments made. The most salient of the conclusions of
this charter were that it:

•

•

•

•

declared that consultation helped defuse conﬂicts before
they break out, between parties that (previously) usually
never met;
introduced enforcement of truck access and delivery
regulations;
highlighted the land scarcity for logistic activities, especially
in the inner suburbs;
suggested that experimenting with new forms of city
logistics organizations is an effective way of spreading new
ideas:
concluded that the relevant jurisdiction for policies is
regional rather than local given that freight ﬂows traverse
all local boundaries.

Box 9.12  Land-use and trans port planning, Bogotá, Colombia

Colombia carried out an ambitious decentralization process
in the mid-1980s, whereby mayors and governors previously
chosen by the president of the republic have since been
elected by universal suffrage and have become the authority in
charge of the principal economic, social and environ mental
devel op ments of their territory. These devel op ments were
facilitated by legislation introduced in the early 1990s that, in
the case of Bogotá, provided for a new organization to be set
up (the Distrito Capital) giving more autonomy to the
executive power (the mayor) and contributing to a better
ﬁscal organization. The ‘Territory Devel op ment Law’,
introduced in 1991, sought to harmonize former legislation,
instructing every municipality and district in Colombia to
autonomously develop long-term plans.

In Bogotá, the mayor of the Distrito Capital was given

wide responsibilities in policy and planning, and in the 
devel op ment of projects in land use, transportation, health,
environ ment, education, public services as well as other
relevant domains, on the understanding they were consistent
with legal frameworks deﬁned at a national level.

Enrique Peñalosa (who was mayor 1998–2001) oversaw

the devel op ment of the TransMilenio BRT system, which
commenced operations in 2000 (Box 7.7). Following its
success, mobility plans were prepared for Bogotá and its
region in 2006. These built on many of the ideas and visions of
the TransMilenio, and ensured complementarity and
consistency with the overall land-use plan.
Sources: Bocarejo and Tafur, 2011; EcoPlan, 2000.

The formal
institutional link
between
TransMilenio and
Bogotá’s
municipal
authorities means
that the inﬂuence
of citizens (as
users of transport)
is strong

Public trans port planning and service
delivery

The TransMilenio system provides mass public trans -
port services – in the form of a BRT system – for the
city of Bogotá, Colombia. It not only provides strat -
egies to improve public trans port but also seeks to
recuperate public space, discourage the use of cars
and encourage cycling (Box 7.7). Devolving power
from  national  to  newly  created  city  govern ments 
with directly elected city mayors was an important
precondition for TransMilenio (Box 9.12). A 1998
law created a public entity with a mandate to manage,
plan and control passen ger urban trans port services
in the metropolitan area of Bogotá.112 By this law,
the  state  builds  and  maintains  the  infra struc ture,
while  private  companies  acquire  and  operate  the
ﬂeets of buses and other public trans port vehicles.
TransMilenio itself  has  no  contracts  with  these
operating companies. Instead, the municipal authority
places the contracts and TransMilenio provides the

management  service  for  infra struc ture  (including
cycle  paths)  and  trans port  operations.  The  formal
institutional link between TransMilenio and Bogotá’s
municipal  authorities  means  that  the  inﬂuence  of
citizens (as users of transport) is strong. The result
is  that  there  is  ‘political  leadership  and  authority 
to  make  the  appropriate  decisions  necessary  to
implement the trans port system’.113

Numerous institutional arrangements have also
recently been set up in India to deliver and operate
BRT  systems,  including  in  Ahmedabad  where
Ahmedabad  Janmarg  Ltd.  was  constituted  to  run/
operate the system. While the Ahmedabad Municipal
Corporation remains the chief executing authority
of the system, the ‘use of local expertise in lieu of
international consultants not only ensured respon -
siveness to local conditions and technology transfer,
but was also effective in keeping cost low’.114 With
state and national level support provided through a
steering committee under the State Urban Devel op -
ment  and  Urban  Housing  Ministry,  together  with

ﬁnan cial and other incentives at the national level,
this strong political commitment across several levels
of  govern ment  was  instrumental  to  the  imple -
mentation of the project.

As in the case of the Janmarg BRT, the Delhi
metro  was  ﬁnanced  from  multi-tiered  funds  and
planned as an integral part of a larger multi-modal
trans port  system.  It  similarly  enjoyed  widespread
political support in central govern ment, even though
the larger scale of the Delhi project presented greater
challenges.  What  is  most  signiﬁcant  about  the
institutional arrangements for this project is that it
is being promoted as a viable public trans port model
for other South Asian cities.115

The  rail-oriented  urban  devel op ment  strategy
employed throughout Japan is also interesting. This
is  supported  by  national  and  city  govern ments,
promoted by inﬂuential private rail companies and
reinforced  by  the  country’s  govern ment.  The  rail
companies are part of large Japanese commercial and
industrial  consortia  that  also  have  real  estate  and
retailing interests, as well as construction and banking
interests. These seek to take advantage of land devel -
op ments around stations so as to ensure maximum
use of their rail networks. They do this by acquiring
large areas of land along proposed rail extensions prior
to any devel op ment. Japan’s rail-orientated devel op -
ment  strategy  has  especially  beneﬁted  from  the
country’s land readjustment programme. Here irreg -
ular patterns of agricultural land holdings were in the
past  rearranged  into  regular  building  plots  and
equipped with basic urban infra struc ture, with a small
percentage  of  each  landowner’s  holding  providing
land for roads and parks to cover the costs of the
project.116

Throughout  the  US,  the  perception  of  urban
public trans port is largely poor. The improvement of
the image and performance of this mode of travel
thus has major governance dimensions. In response
to this, new investments have been made in light rail
and BRT, especially in some of the smaller but rapidly

growing cities, such Portland, Oregon and Salt Lake
City, Utah. In the case of Portland (Box 9.13), govern -
ance  of  land  use  and  trans port  policy  have  been
employed as twin pillars for the creation of additional
capacity and as a stimulus for growth.

Multi-modal integration
The city of Stockholm and its surrounding region are
regarded as having one of Europe’s best public trans -
port systems. Together they are renowned for their
progressive approaches to integrated urban land use
and trans port planning, and multi-modal integration,
with  its  public  trans port services  being  of  special
interest to those concerned about sus tain able urban
mobility.117 The current devel op ment plan for the
Stockholm region foresees a polycentric structure of
seven new ‘cores’ for urban growth, with public trans -
port recognized  as  key  to  meeting  the  increased
mobility  demands  spawned  by  these  new  growth
centres (Figure 5.16).118 It is envisaged that these
cores will eventually function as independent multi-
modal urban trans port hubs that will enhance the
overall efﬁciency of the utilization of transportation
and land use within the region.

To enhance multi-modal integration of passen -
ger  services,  in  August  2012  Storstockholms
Lokaltraﬁk appointed Deutsche Bahn Arriva to pro-
vide a new regional trans port service that involves
planning and operating an integrated and complex
system  of  bus  and  rail.  This  is  the  largest  multi-
modal trans port contract of its kind in Sweden, and
after implementation of the second phase of the con -
tract119 it is estimated that these services will carry
some 94 million passen gers per year.120

There  are  also  some  encouraging  devel op-
ments  in  some  African  cities  where  metropolitan
trans port authorities have recently been established
to  integrate  the  governance  of  disparate  modes. 
An  exam ple  is  the  establishment  (in  2002)  of  the
Metropolitan  Area  Transport  Authority  in  Lagos

Box 9.13 Institutional and governance framework in support of light rail in 

Portland, Oregon, US

Strategy to improve public transport: As part of a broader
strategy for Portland, a light rail system – comprised of 38
closely spaced stations – has increased walking trips and
reduced the demand for parking.
Revenue earning system to ﬁnance the project: To help
ﬁnance the project, city parking charges were increased, and
the city issued bonds backed by future parking revenues
predicted to raise US$28.5 million. Property owners along the
line also agreed to form a ‘local improvement district’ that
looked to generate a further US$10 million, while a tax
increment and mix of other sources generated another 
US$11 million.

Accompanying urban revitalization strategy: The Portland
Devel op ment Council was set up to stimulate the private
market by investing – prior to the project – in new housing,
commercial opportunities and open space in locations near the
light rail stations. This permitted the city to leverage public
improvements necessary to support a more balanced, higher
density devel op ment that in turn generated a signiﬁcant stream
of tax revenue.

Box 9.14  The Lagos Metropolitan Area Trans port Authority (LAMATA), Nigeria

The LAMATA project, funded by US$100 million of World
Bank credit in 2002, involves re-regulation of the informal
sector, and using road rehabilitation as a lever and an
instrument to reduce poverty through employment on road
works.

Public trans port service franchises have been introduced
on roads improved by the project while other (non-franchise)
operators are prohibited from using these roads.

On the institutional side, the project has helped to
create a regulatory authority (LAMATA), with a ﬁnan cial
capacity through a new Transport Fund. The fund is fed by

budget transfers from the Lagos state govern ment, and a 
share of road user charges.

No provision has been made to seek street space

exclusivity for public trans port vehicles, reﬂecting a sober
assessment of what was ‘politically feasible’.

The project design is unusual in that investments in one

mode (road infra struc ture) are used to leverage regulatory
changes for another mode (public trans port services). This was
possible because the client govern ment (Lagos state) has
jurisdiction over both modal systems.

(Nigeria)  (Box  9.14),  and  (in  1997)  the  Executive
Council of Urban Transport in Dakar (Senegal) (Box
9.1).121 In Abidjan (Côte d’Ivoire), in 2002, a state
board (AGETU) was established for the management
and  coordination  of  public  transport,  with  the
management  of  the  mini buses  and  taxi  licences
among  its  principal  tasks.  This  organization  has,
unfortunately, from the outset been hampered by its
conﬂict with the municipalities of Abidjan who have
been reluctant to transfer the funds obtained from
the fees and taxes levied on shared taxis.122

Other cities have also made – or are in the pro -
cess of proposing – important changes to their public
trans port and mobility systems. The municipality of
Montevideo,  Uruguay,  has  since  2005  sought  to
transform its public transport, freight and commercial
devel op ments to offer greater connectivity to ports,
airports and rail termini, simultaneously emphasizing
the  importance  of  non-motorized  movement.123
Similarly, the city authority of Rosario, Argentina, has
after  a  ten  year  experi ence  in  strategic  planning
decided to strategically invest in pedestrian access
to public trans port services and cycle routes. It has
also  imposed  tight  parking  controls.  This  demon -
strates how small cities can function in the broader
territorial context.124

Sus tain able funding
Like  Singapore,  Hong  Kong  (China)  is  widely
considered  to  have  a  successfully  organized  and
sustained funding of its urban trans port system. The
ingredients of Hong Kong’s success can be attributed
to  its  progressive  trans port  policies  maintained 
over the last 30 years; its ‘effective regulatory and
co-ordination  mechanisms  that  subjugated  all
agencies  and  trans port  operators  to  basic  policy
objectives’,  and  ﬁnan cial  discipline  maintained  by 
all  under takings,  both  privately  owned  or  run  on
commercial lines.125 As noted in Chapter 8, Hong
Kong’s  metro  projects  have  always  been  self-
ﬁnan cing, due to its successful policy of value capture,

made possible thorough a full integration of land-use
and trans portation planning. The income generated
by the MTRC from its highly proﬁtable rail-orientated
property  devel op ment,  together  with  its  fare-box
revenues  from  the  very  high  patronage  levels  its
services enjoy, makes MTRC one of the few proﬁt -
able railway companies in the world.126

Mainland China has retained state ownership of
land, which has enabled its urban public authorities
– as in the case of Hong Kong and Singapore – to
capture  far  more  of  the  land-value  increases  asso -
ciated with transportation and other urban infra struc -
ture investments than in most cities elsewhere. The
adoption  of  land  leases  in  China  (generally  of  70
years) for urban transport-related mixed-use devel -
op ments offers huge scope and potential for similar
ﬁnan cial rewards for the public sector. However, in
some cases such rewards are not materializing at the
scale expected. It has been suggested that this is due
to  the  excessively  close  links  that  have  developed
between some city mayors and leading entrepreneurs,
involving non-transparent transactions and conﬂicts
of interests.127

The  mayoral  supervision  responsibilities  pro-
vide  the  mayor  in  Greater  London  (UK)  with  the
mandate and power to rapidly design and implement
congestion charging, which has both improved the
mobility into and through central London, and proved
popular at the same time.128 Further more, in March
2012,  the  mayor  was  given  the  power129 to  raise
money for infra struc ture projects through the intro -
duction of the community infra struc ture levy. These
revenues will be charged on most devel op ments in
London  at  differential  rates  depending  on  zones,
ranging from £20 to £50 per square metre.130 Despite
these initiatives, however, the investment demands
look set to remain challenging due to a backlog of
infra struc ture investment over the last 50 years.

In  the  face  of  such  infra struc ture  investment
challenges, some national govern ments (principally
in  developed  countries)  have  established  national
agencies  speciﬁcally  assigned  responsibilities  for

Box 9.15  Functions of ‘Infra struc ture Australia’

Infra struc ture Australia is a statutory body, established under
the Infra struc ture Australia Act of 2008. It advises govern -
ments, investors and infra struc ture owners on a wide range of
issues that include:

• Australia’s current and future infra struc ture needs;
• Mechanisms for ﬁnancing infra struc ture investments;
•  Policy, pricing and regulation and their impacts on

investment and on the efﬁciency of the delivery, operation
and use of national infra struc ture networks.

Infra struc ture Australia’s focus is on assisting Australian
govern ments to develop a strategic blueprint for unlocking
infra struc ture bottlenecks and to modernize the country’s
economic infra struc ture. Infra struc ture Australia reports
regularly to the Council of Australian Govern ments through
the Federal Minister for Infra struc ture and Transport. 
Infra struc ture Australia has 12 members, appointed by the

CONCLUDING REMARKS
AND LESSONS FOR POLICY
The challenges of urban mobility systems can only
be addressed if they are seen as political challenges,
requiring political consultation, decision and imple -
mentation,  as  opposed  to  seeing  them  as  purely
technical challenges requiring the ‘right’ technical
solutions. Thus, urban governance and related insti -
tutional and regulatory frameworks are at the heart
of  devel op ing  sus tain able urban  mobility  systems,
and, indeed, sus tain able cities. The primary purposes
of such frameworks should be to remove obstacles
to the effective participation of all stakeholders in
the decision-making process; ensure that information
employed  to  support  urban  trans port proposals  is
comprehensive, accurate, impartial and transparent;
and  facilitate  effective  implementation  of  political
decisions.

The devel op ment of effective urban governance
and  institutional  frameworks  is  a  complex  issue.
There are no universal solutions. However, this does
not imply that the identiﬁcation of ‘good practice’ is
futile. Urban trans port agencies and related organ -
izations need to be aware of lessons of urban mobility
planning ‘successes’ (and ‘failures’) from elsewhere
(and other times). Further more, the concept of sus -
tain able devel op ment is increasingly acknowledged
as  a  key  determinant  of  funding  by  international
devel op ment  agencies  in  their  dealings  with  local
decision-makers.  Thus,  it  is  expected  that  the
‘success’  in  attracting  external  funding  to  achieve
more sus tain able outcomes in urban trans port will,
over time, lead to a spreading of good practice.

The institutional architecture for urban trans port
planning  interventions  and  investments  should
facilitate  holistic  thinking  and  integrated  actions
consistent with strategies for sus tain ability. Thus, and
due to their high costs, ad hoc, short-term, politically
expedient  decision-making  should  be  avoided.  In
practice, political champions have played a critical
part  in  creating  integration  in  urban  governance.
Strong political leadership does play an important
part in the planning and delivery of major trans port
infra struc ture projects in particular.131 It is important
that such leadership is transparent and account -
able, to ensure that it doesn’t become personal and
transitional.  This  may  not  only  enhance  people’s
trust in the institutions and governance structures,
but also ensure that these do not collapse once their
champion leaves ofﬁce.

The  objectives,  political  will,  processes  and
effectiveness of public engagement undertaken by
urban trans port organizations are context dependent.
Without effective participation, proper stakeholder
inﬂuence cannot be brought to bear. Measures need
to be introduced that ensure that the mobility needs
and  ‘accessibility  rights’  of  vulnerable  and  dis ad -
vantaged  groups  are  addressed.  Participation  and
consultation  should  also  be  extended  to  informal
sector trans port operators (and their organizations),
in particular due to their essential role in providing
affordable mobility options for low-income groups in
most devel op ing countries.

In  urban  areas  where  no  single  governance
authority exists, this has proved a major impediment
to  integration  in  the  ﬁeld  of  urban  transport.  The
devel op ment of sus tain able urban mobility systems
requires a matching of authority with territory.
‘Effective’  institutions  for  governing  integrated 
trans port  systems  require  empowerment  that  per-
mits  them  to  execute  their  responsibilities  within
their designated area boundaries. Evidence suggests
that  if  institutions  are  matched  to  location  –  cir -
cumstances that encourage public trans port systems,
political  insti tutions,  existing  policy  frameworks,
etc., to evolve in a mutually supportive manner – the
task of integration is largely a matter of operational

coord ination.  Where  there  has  been  a  history  of
intense  inter-agency  competitiveness,  the  task  of
integration is far more problematic.

Experi ence  indicates  that  there  is  a  positive
relationship between effective integrated trans port
systems  and  jurisdictions  that  have  experi ence  in
dealing  with  ‘regional’  types  of  transport.  Many 
of the cities with experi ence in dealing with issues
of  regional  governance  have  over  time  developed
improved multi-modal working relationships in the
trans port  sector.  Likewise,  the  extent  of  central -
ization  and  the  degree  of  effectiveness  of  urban
transportation institutions are very often positively
correlated to the detriment of sus tain able mobility
planning. Thus – where ‘centralization’ represents
the extent to which each mode has its own organ -
izational cultures, constituencies as well as powerful
interest  groups  that  beneﬁt  from  a  modal  focus  –
organizations are frequently focusing on the interests
of the operator of a speciﬁc mode, rather than looking
to intermodal integration.

NOTES

Effective  institutional  devel op ment  and  gov -
ernance for urban mobility requires good land-use
planning, good public trans port planning and good
demand management – designed wherever possible
to minimize the need to travel and to increase the
modal shift toward public and non-motorized trans -
port. To facilitate this, urban trans port and land-use
planning authorities require ongoing capacity-build-
ing  designed  to  keep  abreast  of  key  issues  at  all 
levels and for all sectors of the population. Despite
the increasing need for integrated land-use and
mobility planning, most cities and countries still
separate  the  functions  of  land-use  and  trans port
plan ning at almost every level of govern ment. How -
ever, the value of integrated policy-making, planning
and management is increasingly being acknowledged,
particularly  (but  not  exclusively)  in  developed
countries.

Engineering Department) rather
than with Highways Engineering
(with the latter being an entity
in its own right taking care of
road expansion and
maintenance works)?’. There is

also the issue of different time
horizons: the long term
(requiring strategic planning)
and the short/immediate term
(covering trafﬁc management,
public trans port (bus) planning
and designs, as well as truck
movement management)
(UNCHS, 1990). Further more,
trans port devel op ments involve
a category of ‘trans port service
operator’ (as distinct from
‘user’), which is somewhat
different from the ‘owner’ 
and ‘occupier’ stakeholder
categorizations one ﬁnds with

TOWARD SUS TAIN ABLE 
URBAN MOBILITY

Global trends, such as rapid urbanization and motor -
ization, pose tremendous challenges to urban mobility
and accessibility. Yet, the changing context within
which these are occurring, and the experi ence it is
generating,  present  new  opportunities  for  advan-
cing innovative policies and programmes for sus tain-
able devel op ment as a whole. The previous chapters
have  discussed  the  scope  and  depth  of  numerous
contemporary challenges and best practices in urban
mobility  and  accessibility  worldwide.  This  closing
chapter  ties  the  analysis  together  and  focuses  on
practices, policies and strategies that can be imple -
mented,  not  only  by  local  authorities  but  also  by
national govern ments. The crux of this chapter is an
elucidation  of  the  concrete  ramiﬁcations  of  key
messages espoused in the report pertaining to the
shift  from  focusing  on  improving  the  efﬁciency  of
urban transportation to enhancing accessibility in the
city as a whole.

Before embarking on policy recommendations it
is  appropriate,  ﬁrst,  to  revisit  some  of  the  dys -
functional trends that were highlighted in the prelim -
inary chapters and that necessitate the paradigmatic
shift reiterated throughout this report. Indeed, the
most prominent trend emerging from Chapters 2 to
4 is that, generally, it is becoming more difﬁcult to
access  places,  opportunities  and  services  in  many
cities of the world. Owing to urban sprawl, distances
between functional destinations have become longer;
widespread  congestion  has  increased  travel  time; 
and high capital, as well as operating, expenses have
led to increasing costs of accessibility. As a result, a
number of social groups are structurally discouraged
from accessing many parts of the cities where they
live,  and  a  number  of  city  residents  are  therefore
deprived of the full beneﬁts offered by urbanization.
Further more,  poor  accessibility  has  reduced  the
efﬁciency  and  functionality  of  many  cities  in  the
world.

Another trend highlighted in this report is the
steady  increase  in  the  share  of  private  motorized
transport, including the extremely high motorization

rates  in  devel op ing  countries.  This  also  occurs  in
regions  where  the  dominant  mode  of  mobility
remains non-motorized transportation, such as in the
case  of  Africa  and  Asia.  Apart  from  the  inherent
inequity associated with private motorized transport,
the  negative  externalities  it  generates  are  quite
substantial.  It  has  been  revealed  that  there  is  a
relative stagnation and even decline of public trans -
port in cities of devel op ing countries, even though
it constitutes a most effective means of enhancing
urban accessibility, as well as of promoting sus tain -
able urban devel op ment.

The report also reveals that the conﬁguration of
cities in terms of form, structure and function has
been highly inﬂuenced by the dominance of private
trans port infra struc ture, facilities and services. The
embedded imperative of private motorization as the
dominant  mobility  mode  has  dictated  the  layout 
and design of streets and neigh bour hoods; dispersion
of densities; and location of functions. Perpetuation
of this model in much of the past century has gen -
erated a self-replicating crisis of urban accessibility:
more  vehicles,  necessitating  more  infra struc ture,
compel ling a need for more vehicles, fostering more
spatial  expansion,  calling  for  additional  infra struc-
ture and vehicles, with the vicious circle continuing
ad inﬁnitum. At the same time, in most cities, the
neglect of urban freight distribution and management
of freight transport, both in land-use and trans port
planning tends to make goods transportation a major
impediment  to  sus tain able urban  mobility  and  to
accessing the city.

Underlying all the above challenges has been a
marked  distortion  in  the  institutional  structures,
management systems, as well as legal and regulatory
frameworks. Fragmentation among institutions deal -
ing with different aspects of mobility and accessibility
is rife. The management principles and norms guid-
ing planning, design and even delivery tend to com -
pound the problems instead of ameliorating them.
More over, the regulatory instruments are not fully
com patible with the demands of sus tain ability.

Value generation
through
accessibility 
has not been
optimally utilized
in many cities of 
. . . developed and
developing
countries

Urban mobility
and accessibility
are key for
promoting
sustainable urban
development

Urban mobility is
ﬁnely woven into
the spatial, social,
economic,
political and
environmental
fabric of cities

It is essential that
travel is
recognized as a
‘derived demand’
– i.e. derived from
the need for
people to socially
and economically
‘interact’. . . . this
distinction shifts
the focus to
‘people’ and
‘places’ and away
from ‘movement’

Planning and Design for Sustainable Urban Mobility

The report has highlighted that the world market
for railway infra struc ture and equipment has been
growing at 3.2 per cent a year, and is set to grow at
around 2.7 per cent annually.1 However, the global
distribution of metro systems shows a concentration
of metros in Europe, Eastern Asia and the eastern
part of the US. It is further noted that in mega-cities
of devel op ing countries where the mobility demand
on  major  corridors  is  appropriately  high,  metros
remain the only economically and environ mentally
viable public trans port system. For cities which do
not have the passen ger threshold for metros and the
eco nomic capacity to invest in them, bus rapid transit
(BRT) has become a viable option, at least in the short
and medium term.

On  the  whole,  the  report  acknowledges  the
critical  importance  of  accessibility  for  enhancing 
the economies of agglomeration and urbanization. It
analyses  how  the  urban  function  is  improved  and
potential  of  value  enhancement  realized  through
accessibility.  However,  the  report  shows  that  the
process of value generation through accessibility has
not been optimally utilized in many cities of both the
developed  and  devel op ing  countries.  In  the  latter 
case this has been largely due to the separation and
sectoralization of land use and transportation, as well
as the inadequate integration among trans port modes.
In the case of some cities in developed countries,
delays  and  procrastinations  in  investments  and
expansion have led to lost opportunities.

The report underlines that urban mobility and
accessibility  are  key  for  promoting  sus tain able
urban devel op ment. They are also directly connected
to urban stock and ﬂows – in terms of spatial devel -
opment  and  consolidation  of  the  built  form.  They 
are therefore associated with value creation, improve -
ment  of  welfare  and  enhancement  of  citizenship.
Further more,  urban  mobility  systems  have  the
potential to positively impact on material and energy
ﬂows. However, these systems have not ade quately
contributed to the desired outcomes owing to their
prevailing shortcomings. This report therefore empha -
sizes that there is an urgent need to reframe urban
mobility policies and practices in order to address
these shortcomings.

POLICIES AND PRACTICES
FOR REFRAMING URBAN
MOBILITY
The  overall  challenges  as  well  as  positive  experi-
ences and practices discussed in this report form the
basis  for  key  lessons  to  be  drawn  for  adaptation 
and replication. They underline the multi-dimensional
nature of sus tain able urban mobility in terms of both
policy  and  operational  implications.  Coherence  in
strategic interventions and linkages among processes

are some of the essential principles that emerge from
the  preceding  chapters.  It  is  reckoned  that  the
ultimate  enhancement  of  accessibility  is  neither  a
function of hardware – be it highways, rail or vehicles
– nor an outcome of ad hoc spatial delocalization and
decongestion.

This  report  advocates  for  a  paradigm  shift  in
addressing urban mobility. The signposts of how to
make  the  shift  are  written  throughout  the  report. 
The discussion below summarizes some of the key
attributes  for  a  recalibration  of  how  cities  are
designed  and  planned  and  how  urban  trans port
services are organized and delivered in the quest for
more sus tain able mobility.

Holistic and systemic thinking and action
Urban  mobility  is  ﬁnely  woven  into  the  spatial, 
social, economic, political and environ mental fabric
of  cities.  In  charting  a  path  for  sus tain able urban
mobil ity,  it  is  essential  to  apply  an  ecological  and
systems framework that recognizes this. Many of the
contem porary challenges facing cities – for example
auto-dependent  sprawl,  persistent  poverty,  lack  of
accountability and participatory decision-making – are
structural  in  nature,  rooted  in  current  regulatory,
institutional and economic systems and approaches.
Only by recognizing the systemic nature of problems
(mispricing  leads  to  overconsumption  of  roads  in 
peak periods; sprawling settlement patterns render
public trans port systems ineffectual; urban design for
machines rather than people creates cities for cars
rather than people) can signiﬁcant headway be made
in charting a sus tain able mobility future.

Trans port as a means, not an end
It is essential that travel is recognized as a ‘derived
demand’ – i.e. derived from the need for people to
socially and economically ‘interact’. The end or objec -
tive of most travel is to meet a friend, earn income,
attend  school  or  purchase  a  good,  not  movement 
per se. Cars, trains, buses and bikes are simply the
means to achieve these ends. Making this distinction
shifts the focus to ‘people’ and ‘places’ and away from
‘movement’. This realization envisages cities, neigh -
bour hoods,  regions  and  mobility  systems  as  tools 
that  promote  desired  societal  outcomes  –  such  as 
live ability  and  affordable  access  –  with  trans port
playing  a  supportive  role.  Operationally,  this  can
take the form of compact, mixed-use communities
that dramatically shorten trip distances and improve
pedestrian  and  bicycling  infra struc ture.  Compact
cities are less reliant on private cars and minimize
distances travelled, thereby conserving energy, land
and  environ mental resources.  They  are  also  more
resilient, enabling them to better adapt to the vagaries
and uncertainties of climate change and other global
unknowns.

Accessibility as a priority rather than
transport
Related to this notion of travel as a derived demand
and transportation as a means to an end is the core
principle of accessibility. Accessible cities not only
put  places  (e.g.  homes  and  workplaces,  or  ‘trip
origins and destinations’) closer to each other, but
also provide safe and efﬁcient pedestrian and cycling
corridors and affordable, high-quality public trans port
options. That is, they are accessible to all. Recasting
the sector’s primary objective as one of enhancing
accessibility  invariably  leads  to  a  different  set  of
policies and strategies, like transit-oriented devel op -
ment  and  the  provision  of  highly  interconnected
bikeway networks. These strategies not only conserve
land, energy and ﬁnan cial resources, but also help
the poor and those without private motorized vehicles
to access goods and services within the city. In short,
accessible cities are inclusive, resourceful and pro-
poor.

POLICY AND OPERATIONAL
ENTRY POINTS
From  the  above  normative  framework,  the  follow-
ing section presents six policy and operational areas
that can be developed to suit different settings and
through which accessibility-based sus tain able mobility
can be achieved. These are: enhancing the linkage
between land use and transport; revitalizing urban
planning  and  trans port  engineering  designs;
realigning  trans port  infra struc ture  investment  and
devel op ment;  integrating  urban  trans port facilities
and service operations; streamlining urban institu -
tions  and  governance  framework;  and  readjust-
ing legal and regulatory instruments. Each of these
is  discussed  in  some  more  detail  in  the  sections
below.

The generic designation of the above categories
reﬂects everyday policy processes. These policy areas
have  been  adopted  for  this  conclusion  for  two
reasons. First, to underscore the fact that the shift
being advocated in this report is mainly viable when
undertaken within existing institutional structures
and processes. Second, to highlight that since these
are generic proposals, they would have to be slightly
adapted to each city’s unique circumstances prior to
actual implementation. Further more, the categories
are also deemed appropriate because they allow for
encompassing  a  variety  of  settings  and  levels  of
devel op ment. However, the overall logic of the six
categories  lies  in  their  strategic  linkage  and  their
cumulative  potential  for  triggering  policy  and
operational change.

Toward Sustainable Urban Mobility

Enhancing the linkage between land use
and transport
While  the  pitfalls  of  overreliance  on  technological 
and  supply-side  solutions  to  urban  mobility  are
acknow ledged, the important role of trans port cannot
be discounted. The missing ingredient causing the
observed pitfall has been the disconnect between the
essence of land use and the logic of transport. This
connection needs to be re-established for sus tain able
urban  mobility  to  be  achieved;  and  it  can  only  be
effectively  initiated  at  the  highest  level  –  through
national urban policy initiatives.

Indeed,  the  national  urban  policy  is  given
prominence for this connection mainly because of
its  role  as  a  statutory  instrument  that  not  only
articulates a vision for urban devel op ment, but also
deﬁnes the relationship among sectors, agencies and
stakeholders.  When  properly  articulated,  national
urban policy offers the most authoritative instrument
for elevating the linkage between land-use and trans -
port  planning  beyond  the  bureaucratic  and  polit-
ical  compromises  often  reached.  As  elaborated  in
Chapter 5, the integration is not simply a technical
exercise at the local level. It represents a totality of
how cities are at a given time, while also identifying
the parameters of their future growth. Substantive
guidelines are therefore required to ensure effective
harnessing of the dynamic synergy of a given national
urban system. These guidelines should then subse -
quently be translated at the sub-national level – from
region, through metropolitan area, to the municipality
and ultimately at the neigh bour hood and street level.
An integrated approach to land use and trans -
port harmonizes planning of the two processes out
of  the  bounded  conﬁnes  of  speciﬁc  ministry  and
departmental mandates, turning them into a coord -
inated and integrated exercise at policy and opera -
tional  levels.  It  shifts  the  focus  of  planning  from
placement of structures and designation of land use
to that of enabling the realization of people’s needs
and everyday functions in the most efﬁcient and sus -
tain able manner.  Within  this  approach,  the  key
challenge is therefore not merely to overcome the
separate  handling  of  trans port  and  land-use  plan-
ning; or even to ensure a juxtaposition of the two.
Rather, it is to foster an organic integration of the
entire continuum of a multi-modal mobility within a
holistic  and  sus tain able land-use  system  where
dynamic synergies are harnessed; interconnections
are  promoted;  and  functionality  optimized.  In  the
whole process, the aspect of design serves as a main
bridge linking the key dimensions and attributes for
ensuring sus tain ability and accessibility.

In many cities of the world, particularly those
in devel op ing countries, there is a persisting challenge
of identifying whose responsibility it is to take the
integration of land use and trans port (and ideas such
as those mentioned above) from theory to a practical

level. This is particularly the case in view of existing
constraints of land geography, activity distribution and
evolution,  economic  and  ﬁnan cial  constraints,  and
institutional and regulatory limitations.

The comprehensive integration of land-use and
trans port  needs  to  be  thematically  cross-cutting 
and multi-sectoral. This reﬂects the co-dependence
of urban systems – for example urban growth induced
by  a  world-class  high-capacity  public  trans port
investment increases the demand for electric power
and water capacity, new housing construction and
business centres. Multi-sectoral planning also exploits
opportunities for economizing on the costs of urban
services  and  infra struc ture  outlays,  such  as  using
rights  of  way  reserved  for  a  new  ﬁxed-guideway
public  trans port line  to  also  lay  broadband  cable,
storm-runoff channels and utility lines.

Revitalizing urban planning and trans port
engineering designs
The strong connection between trans port ‘supply and
demand’ and urban form is a key theme highlighted
throughout this report. These inﬂuence and reinforce
each other both in positive and negative ways. The
various cases highlighted in the report demonstrate
that the convenience of mobility and the degree of
accessibility in cities are determined by the processes
emanating  from  the  relationship  between  the  pat -
terns of trans port and urban form in the given setting.
From the analysis of Chapter 5 on urban form, and
the elaboration of sus tain ability pillars in the subse -
quent chapters, an important organizing prin ciple can
be deduced. Namely, the linkage between urban form
and trans port is realized through the optimization of
density, enhanced proximity and co-location, as well
as improvements in the functionality and inclusive -
ness of places and facilities.

Sus tain able densities are essential for sus tainable
mobility; not only because of its minimum energy
consumption  and  smaller  environ mental footprint,
but also because it contributes to increasing proximity
and co-location. Density can be optimized through
the  use  of  regulatory  instruments,  such  as  zoning 
laws and the application of locational incen tives, such
as  infrastructural  investments,  as  well  as  through
design interventions. Compact conﬁgurations com -
ple mented  with  transport-oriented  devel op ment
minimize private motorization while making it viable
for  cities  to  invest  in  different  modes  of  public
transportation. Different density conﬁgurations and
gradients are discussed in the report demonstrating
the range of options in promoting compactness for
sus tain able mobility.  However,  a  caution  is  also
registered that while density is necessary, it is not a
sufﬁcient condition especially for moderating private
car use and for arresting urban sprawl.

The notion of sus tain able density is applied in
the report in the strict sense of making a distinction

with  the  condition  of  over crowding  or  with  slum-
like  concentration  of  populations.  The  planned
optimization  of  density  advocated  in  this  report
enables  the  attainment  of  economies  of  scale, 
making it viable to provide a range of facilities at the
least cost. The compactness engendered allows for
more public space while also exerting a minimum
impact  on  the  environ ment.  Coupled  with  appro -
priate design it encourages non-motorized and public
transportation, fosters conviviality and strengthens
a sense of place.

A related attribute is the need to ensure diversity
and mixed-use neigh bour hoods. Through the use of
planning, a variety of housing types is provided, the
location of jobs and housing is balanced and a range
of everyday amenities are located within easy reach.
Mixed-land use promotes non-motorized trans port by
increasing proximity and reducing the need to travel,
thus allowing for accomplishing many activities with
shorter and fewer trips. All this is achieved through
the  creative  deployment  of  planning  and  design 
and innovative trans port engineering and planning
designs.

The quality of the connection between points
of  origin  and  destination  is  enhanced  by  the
functionality and inclusiveness of those places and
facil ities. The value of access is enhanced by increas -
ing  the  functionality  of  each  place,  thus  reducing 
not only distances but also the number of trips. Also,
the fostering of inclusiveness and a sense of place
removes  inhibitions  and  promotes  identity  and
conviviality. Trans port engineering design and urban
design are central tools at this level and, as demon -
strated in Chapter 5, street conﬁgurations, trans port
nodes and neigh bour hood layouts are the main areas
where interventions take place.

While  a  lot  more  research  is  needed  on
integrating freight distribution into the framework
of sus tain able urban mobility through planning and
design,  there  are  a  few  practices  that  have  been
developed and that can contribute to reducing the
prevailing  shortcomings  of  freight  distribution  in
cities.  These  include:  rationalization  of  delivery,
improving  freight  facilities  and  promoting  modal
adaptation. However, it has been noted in the report
that  the  commercial  logic  of  freight  distribution
tends to be at variance with most of the principles
of sus tain able urban devel op ment.

Realigning trans port infra struc ture
investment and devel op ment
This report acknowledges that the choice of infra -
struc ture investments – particularly budgeting and
ﬁnancing  aspects  –  is  central  in  determining  the
choices  and  options  for  sus tain able mobility.  It  is
important  that  gradual  steps  are  taken  to  correct 
the current imbalance in funding and investments
between private and public modes of transport. More

public resources need to be allocated to facilities that
cater to the needs of the majority of people in both
developed and devel op ing countries. The current bias
towards roads and highways needs to be corrected
so that more funding is assigned to devel op ing and
expanding  non-motorized  and  high-capacity  public
trans port infra struc ture.

It is particularly important that cities investing
in metro, light rail and high-end BRT systems direct
larger  shares  of  future  growth  to  public  trans port
corridors.  Transport-oriented  devel op ment  can
reverse the kind of car-based sprawl that eats into
the green agenda of cities. However, it is important
that a proper alignment between land-use and trans -
port layout is maintained, otherwise the reverse –
i.e. urban sprawl – can be further extended by high-
capacity public trans port systems.

It  is  also  important  that  the  urban  trans port
sector  is  treated  as  an  integrated  whole  through
systems ﬁnancing and pricing. This is best accom -
plished by pooling ﬁscal resources into a central fund
and distributing them among modes and pro grammes
in  accordance  with  well-deﬁned  objectives,  such 
as  air-quality  improvements  and  reduced  trafﬁc
congestion.  Such  coordinated  and  centralized
ﬁnancing  is  today  practised  throughout  the  US,
Canada, Singapore and Japan. Dedicated, long-term
funding is also essential to allow strategic, forward-
looking planning, such as preserving rights of way
for future infra struc ture investments. However, it is
important to note that in some cities of devel op ing
countries it is easier to negotiate and secure funding
for metro, light rail or BRT systems than for meeting
the (very marginal) cost of implementing integration
facilities with other urban trans port modes – such
as buses, informal share taxis and cars – at metro,
light rail or BRT stations.

Owing  to  the  ﬁnan cial  constraints  of  local
govern ments  and  increased  interest  by  private
investors,  the  global  urban  trans port sector  has
witnessed  a  surge  in  public–private  partnerships.
These partnerships are managed through contracts,
franchises, concessions and, in some instances, the
trans port  services  have  undergone  full  privatiza-
tion. Public–private partnerships have the potential
to inject efﬁciencies in the urban trans port sector
and also stimulate innovations, such as market-based
pricing and automated toll collection. They may also
draw  in  private  capital  where  public  funding  is
restricted. Public–private partnerships have generally
worked  best  in  rapidly  growing  and  urbanizing
countries  and  regions  –  such  as  the  Republic  of
Korea and Taiwan (China) – and where there is the
institutional capacity to oversee and regulate private
actors. This underscores the need to achieve both
economic and institutional sus tain ability. However,
this report also highlights the potential dangers of
using public–private partnerships in urban mobility
projects,2 as  experi ences  from  a  number  of  cities

indicate that the ﬁnan cial risks in such projects tend
to be carried by the public at large rather than by
the private sector partners involved.

The implementation of principles of economic
efﬁciency is essential to the urban public trans port
sector, since it has major ﬁnan cial implications on
local  govern ments.  For  instance,  while  urban  rail
systems handle large loads, they do so at very high,
and potentially ﬁnan cially crippling, costs. The high
capital investments and subsequent operating costs
needed  to  support  a  metro  investment  must  be
carefully examined to ensure that local and national
govern ments have the ﬁnan cial capacity to maintain
its  services.  Unless  a  city’s  urban  densities  are
comparatively  high  and  ﬁnan cial  resources  are
plentiful, lower-cost BRT investments – as recently
implemented by cities such as Jakarta (Indonesia),
Ahmedabad (India), Lagos (Nigeria) and Chiang Mai
(Thailand)  –  present  a  more  practical  option  for
investment in high-capacity public transport.

A key point made in this report is that the sus -
tain ability  of  urban  mobility  systems  is  highly
dependent  on  the  ﬁnan cial  models  designed  to
protect the public goods dimension of both land use
and  the  trans port  system.  Among  other  ﬁnancing
sources,  the  option  of  value  capture  is  highly
recommended as a complement to public funding.
Through recouping the increase of value in adjacent
land  and  converting  it  into  public  ﬁnance  for
reinvestment in urban mobility systems, the linkage
between land use and trans port is reinforced. This
approach  is  also  politically  appealing  as  it  directly
demonstrates the linkage between charges levied and
the beneﬁts provided.

Integrating urban trans port facilities and
service operations
The  linkage  of  trans port  to  land  use  is  not  only
limited to the hardware and the physical dimensions
of  the  two  processes.  Transport-oriented  devel op -
ment and trafﬁc-calming interventions discussed in
this report also involve the systemic and managerial
aspects  of  ensuring  convenience,  efﬁciency,  aes -
thetics and safety of mobility. The operation of multi-
modal  neigh bour hood  stations;  the  ambiance
surrounding ﬂow of vehicles, bicycles and pedestrian
in streets; and the procedures at toll-collection points,
have to be synchronized in a manner that ensures a
pleasant mobility experi ence.

The urban trans port sector must ascribe to the
principle of economic efﬁciency for the simple reason
that waste and unsound expenditures could imply
that scarce ﬁnan cial resources are directed to other
productive and beneﬁcial societal uses, be they edu -
cation, healthcare or private consumption. Efﬁcient
land-use patterns (e.g. compact, mixed and walkable)
allow for less reliance on expensive mobility systems
in general. Properly designed trans port systems also

contribute to business expansion, increased economic
output and employment generation. Indeed, mobility
is indisputably a necessary (though not a sufﬁcient)
precondition to economic growth and expansion.

Efﬁciency must underpin management, opera -
tional and system design practices throughout the
urban trans port sector. In the case of high-capacity
public trans port systems, this can take the form of
redeploying buses and equipment to high-ridership
markets that produce the highest fare-box returns.
In doing so, it is necessary to adopt the regulations
that  allow  operators  to  develop ‘out  of  fare-box’
ﬁnancing resources such as value capture, advertising
at stations, stops and vehicles, etc., in order to cross-
subsidize  services,  thus,  reducing  or  eliminating
govern ment subsidies. For non-motorized transport,
it might mean building bikeway overpasses at busy
junctions  where  careful  cost–beneﬁt  calculations
reveal a net societal gain. The report highlights the
difﬁculties  faced  by  cities  of  devel op ing  countries 
in securing funding to cover construction and main -
tenance  costs  of  non-motorized  trans port infra -
structure, from both public and other sources. As
non-motorized  trans port facilities  are  not  revenue
generating, they are rarely attractive to international
funding  agencies  or  the  private  sector.  Efforts  are
needed to reach innovative ideas that point out the
environ mental and  societal  gains  made  from  non-
motorized transport.3 For urban goods movement,
night  or  off-peak  deliveries,  freight  stations  and
consolidation centres that allow shared-use of delivery
vehicles, and bicycle carriers suited to the constraints
of urban circulation, might be called for. For parking,
efﬁciency might be achieved by installing sensors in
parking stalls to monitor occupancy so that charges
can  be  varied  according  to  demand  and  motorists 
can  be  real-time  navigated  to  the  closest  available
parking space.4

Because  transportation  is  both  a  private  and 
a public good – conferring beneﬁts to both individual
users and society at large – a combination of user
charges  and  public  support  is  often  needed  to
efﬁciently and equitably ﬁnance trans port infra struc -
ture and services. User fees, such as public trans -
port fares  and  road  charges,  encourage  efﬁcient
behaviour.  When  fuel  taxes  rise,  increased  prices
encourage motorists to acquire more fuel-efﬁcient
vehicles or switch to public transport. Funding trans -
port facilities through general sales, income taxes or
borrowing provides no incentive to be efﬁcient or
socially responsible; as such charges are completely
unrelated  to  the  cost  imposed  on  the  trans port
system or the beneﬁts received.

Integrated  transportation  and  urban  devel op -
ment must occur at all geographic scales. At the micro
level, much is to be gained from advancing the model
of  ‘complete  streets’,  an  acknowledgement  that
streets serve numerous purposes, not just moving
cars and trucks. The ‘complete streets’ movement,

gaining  steam  throughout  Europe,  much  of  North
America and in parts of Eastern Asia, views road right
of way as ‘public spaces’, managing and even slowing
movements in favour of public transport, walking and
cycling. One example is multi-way boulevards that
provide spaces for cars, buses, pedestrians and some -
times even tramways – packaged with good designs
that emphasize high-quality spaces and safety.5 Non-
motorized modes of trans port such as walking and
cycling, enliven a city, promote social interaction and
allow a more physically active lifestyle. Some cities
have  gone  one  step  further,  reclaiming  land  once
given  over  to  motorways  and  freeways  to  pedes-
trians, cyclists and public transport. Seoul’s Cheng
Gye Cheon freeway-to-greenway conversion, made
possible in part by expanded BRT services to absorb
lost roadway capacity, has not only reduced inner-
city trafﬁc congestion but has also been credited with
spurring central-city redevel op ment and urban inﬁll.
The 6-kilometre inner-city greenway laced with bike
paths  and  urban  art  is  today  Seoul’s  second  most
popular tourist destination.6

Progressive projects and programmes – such as
green transport-oriented devel op ment and complete
streets – do not suddenly appear, but rather begin
with thoughtful plans and visions. Trans port planning
needs  to  be  well  integrated  with  land-use  plan-
ning at all levels of govern ment. Through both carrots
(e.g.  ﬁnan cial  aid)  and  sticks  (e.g.  regulatory
requirements),  national  govern ments  are  uniquely
positioned  to  encourage  state/provincial,  regional
and local institutions to link trans port investment and
urban devel op ment strategies in master plans, zoning
practices  and  infra struc ture  design  standards.
Integrated  trans port  and  land-use  planning  devel -
opment must also be emphasized in national urban
devel op ment  policies  and  plans.  India’s  national
urban  trans port policy  of  2006,  for  example,  em -
braces integrated trans port and land-use planning as
its  number-one  priority.  In  fact,  half  the  cost  of
preparing integrated trans port and land-use plans in
Indian cities is covered by the central govern ment.7

Streamlining urban institutions and
governance framework
Innovative  ideas  and  policies  geared  towards  sus -
tainable mobility  require  strong  institutional  and
governance  structures  to  oversee  their  successful
implementation.  Political  will,  sound  leadership,
transparency  and  accountability  are  essential  in
building public trust. Also vital to the entire process
are the planning institutions, as these are capable of
creating compelling visions of urban futures. More -
over, participatory mechanisms must be in place to
ensure that planning and investment decisions are
socially inclusive and representative of all segments
of society. This implies giving non-state actors and
city residents, such as neigh bour hood associations,

a  place  at  the  negotiating  table  when  making
important urban mobility decisions. In strengthening
institutions, it is essential that ﬁnan cial resources be
channelled into training and capacity-building of the
concerned personnel in order to empower them to
take  on  the  complex  challenges  of  the  urban
transportation sector.

The devel op ment of a fully integrated and sus -
tain able multi-modal  urban  transportation  system
requires  a  robust  regional  governance  structure,
which gives rise to inter-municipal cooperation. This
fosters  accountability  and  provides  a  territorial
context for coordinating growth and services within
a region’s travel-shed. Regional institutions need to
be endowed with the power of regulatory oversight
and  funding  capacities  to  ﬁnance  transportation
investments and service management.

As noted above, while most of the innovations
introduced in urban trans port will come from local
and regional actors, higher levels of govern ment also
have a crucial role to play. National urban trans port
policies that promote integrated planning and provide
capital loans and technical assistance can help smaller
cities  chart  a  sus tain able urban  trans port course.8
Brazil has had a national urban trans port policy for
over 25 years, helping nurture sus tain able trans port
practices in BRT-served cities such as Curitiba and
Belo Horizonte. India’s Ministry of Urban Devel op -
ment is today actively promoting transport-oriented
devel op ment  along  planned  and  existing  BRT
corridors  through  ﬁnan cial  support  for  forming
uniﬁed metropolitan trans port authorities.9

Technology  itself  can  be  an  enabler  of  more
grassroots  and  inclusive  policy-making  in  urban
transport.  Social  media,  for  example,  allows  like-
minded  individuals  to  coalesce  and  shape  public
discourse.  In  2008,  during  a  period  when  the
TransMilenio BRT system in Bogotá, Colombia, was
suffering  from  problems  of  extreme  over crowding
and long queues at ticket ofﬁces, residents turned
to  social  media  to  organize  a  large  public  protest.
Active  media  coverage  led  to  even  louder  public
outcries,  eventually  prompting  local  leaders  to
introduce  various  capacity-expansion  initiatives,
including  lengthening  some  of  the  key  modular
stations, expanding services and introducing more
articulated buses.10

There  is  also  a  need  to  inject  efﬁciencies,
accountability and transparency into the urban trans -
port decision-making process. This requires the devel -
op ment and institutionalization of planning processes
and evaluation approaches that are based on objective
measures of performance and tied to well-articulated
goals and hoped-for outcomes. This promotes both
transparency and accountability. At the same time,
there is need for an open and democratic planning
and decision-making process, in particular given the
broad  reach  of  the  urban  trans port sector  and  its
merits.  This  will  not  only  bring  the  voices  of  all

citizens – women and men, children, the elderly, the
disabled, businesses, govern ments, NGOs and civil
society at large – to the table, but will also ensure
that  the  needs  of  the  least  advantaged  are  clearly
recognized and fully acted upon.

Responsibilities for the urban trans port sector
are  being  decentralized  across  the  world,  from
Eastern  Europe,  to  Sub-Saharan  Africa  and  South -
Eastern  Asia.  Human  and  ﬁnan cial  resources  are
needed for the successful handover of functions and
investment  responsibilities  from  central  to  local
govern ments.  There  is  a  need  for  metropolitan
planning and operating authorities that reﬂect regions
as ‘ecological units’ – i.e. by allowing planning and
governance over a geographic territory that mimics
commute-sheds, trade-sheds and air basins. Human
resource devel op ment plans and integrated, viable
and dependable urban trans port funding programmes
are also needed.

Readjusting legal and regulatory
instruments
The interventions highlighted above call for changes
in  the  management  of  space,  the  built  form,  the
engineering of transport, social behaviour, as well as
in  the  institutional  and  ﬁnancing  arrangements
related to urban devel op ment. These elements are
built upon the legacy of a legal foundation that has
perpetuated mobility systems which this report has
found  to  be  severely  wanting.  Any  transformation
would therefore entail major reform in the legal and
regulatory framework relating to urban management.
For  example,  the  ordinances  guiding  the  planning
process have to be amended away from often applied
segregation of use and rigid zoning towards fostering
more mixed-use and compactness. The same applies
to  building  codes  and  standards,  mandates  and
authority allocated to different institutions, and also
sanctions directed at reducing negative externalities.
While signiﬁcant progress has been achieved in
some cities, in terms of incorporating the necessary
laws and regulation for realizing some of the above
objectives, much remains to be done. The dire need
for  fostering  inclusiveness  and  environ mental
protection  not  only  calls  for  the  enactment  of  a
comprehensive set of statutes, but also requires the
consolidation of enforcement capacity to ensure that
the laws and regulations are abided by.

issue  of  sus tain able mobility.  Similarly,  the  quest
towards  eliminating  poverty  and  fostering  shared

This  report  has  demonstrated  that  mobility
systems  contribute  to  the  morphology  of  the  city,
both in terms of the spatial layout as well as in the
conﬁguration  of  its  built  form.  In  so  far  as  these 

two  elements  are  related  to  the  productivity  and
dynamism  of  the  city  in  the  broader  setting,  the
impact of urban mobility is therefore local as well as
macro. The report suggests that along the three key
pillars of sus tain able devel op ment – and within the
foundations of robust, integrated and participatory
institutions – it is possible to initiate and promote
interventions  that  can  effectively  enhance  the
accessibility of cities today.

NOMENCLATURE AND
ORDER OF PRESENTATION
Tables A.1 to A.5 contain regional data, grouped in
geographic aggregates. Tables B.1 to B.9 and C.1 to
C.3 contain country- and city-level data, respectively.
In these tables, the countries or areas are listed in
English alphabetical order within the macro-regions
of  Africa,  Asia,  Europe,  Latin  America,  Northern
America and Oceania. Countries or area names are
presented  in  the  form  commonly  used  within  the
United Nations Secretariat for statistical purposes.
Due to space limitations, the short name is used –
for example, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland is referred to as ‘United Kingdom’.

DEFINITION OF TERMS
Access  to  electricity:  percentage  of  households
that,  within  their  housing  unit,  are  connected  to
electricity.
Access to piped water: percentage of households
that, for source of drinking water, are connected to
piped water within their housing unit, tap placed in
the yard or plot outside the house.
Access  to  telephone:  percentage  of  households
that,  within  their  housing  unit,  are  connected  to
telephone.
Access to mobile: percentage of households with
mobile phone.
Gini index: the extent to which the distribution of
income (or, in some cases, consumption expenditure)
or  assets  (such  as  land)  among  individuals  or
households  within  an  economy  deviates  from  a
perfectly equal distribution. A Lorenz curve plots the
cumulative  percentages  of  total  income  received
against the cumulative number of recipients, starting
with the poorest individual or household. The Gini
index measures the area between the Lorenz curve

and a hypothetical line of absolute equality, expressed
as a percentage of the maximum area under the line.
Thus, a Gini index of 0 represents perfect equality,
while an index of 1 implies absolute inequality.
Gross national income: the sum of value added by
all resident producers plus any product taxes (less
subsidies) not included in the valuation of output plus
net  receipts  of  primary  income  (compensation  of
employees and property income) from abroad. Data
are in current US dollars converted using the World
Bank Atlas method.
Gross national income per capita: gross national
income (GNI) divided by mid-year population. GNI
per capita in US dollars is converted using the World
Bank Atlas method.
Gross national income PPP: gross national income
converted to international dollars using purchasing
power parity (PPP) rates. An international dollar has
the same purchasing power over GNI as a US dollar
has in the United States of America.
Household: the concept of household is based on
the arrangements made by persons, individually or
in groups, for providing themselves with food or other
essentials for living. A household may be either:

1. A  one-person  household:  a  person  who  makes
provision  for  his  or  her  own  food  or  other
essentials for living without combining with any
other  person  to  form  a  part  of  a  multi-person
household.

2. A multi-person household: a group of two or more
persons  living  together  who  make  common
provision for food or other essentials for living.
The persons in the group may pool their incomes
and  may,  to  a  greater  or  lesser  extent,  have  a
common budget; they may be related or unrelated
persons or constitute a combination of persons
both related and unrelated. This concept of house -
hold is known as the ‘housekeeping’ con cept. It
does not assume that the number of households
and housing units is equal. Although the concept
of  housing  unit  implies  that  it  is  a  space  occu-
pied by one household, it may also be occupied
by  more  than  one  household  or  by  a  part  of  a
household (e.g. two nuclear households that share
one  housing  unit  for  economic  reasons  or  one
household  in  a  polygamous  society  routinely
occupying two or more housing units).

Household  connection  to  improved  drinking
water: percentage of households that, within their
housing unit, are connected to any of the following
types  of  water  supply  for  drinking:  piped  water,
public  tap,  borehole  or  pump,  protected  well,
protected spring or rainwater.
Improved drinking water coverage: percentage of
people  using  improved  drinking  water  sources  or

delivery points. Improved drinking water technologies
are more likely to provide safe drinking water than
those  characterized  as  unimproved.  Improved
drinking water sources: piped water into dwelling,
plot or yard; public tap/standpipe; tube well/borehole;
protected  dug  well;  protected  spring;  rainwater
collection. Unimproved drinking water sources:
unprotected dug well; unprotected spring; cart with
small tank/drum; bottled water;2 tanker-truck; surface
water (river, dam, lake, pond, stream, canal, irrigation
channels).

Improved  sanitation  coverage: percentage  of
people using improved sanitation facilities. Improved
sanitation facilities are more likely to prevent human
contact  with  human  excreta  than  unimproved
facilities.

International  poverty  line: based  on  nationally
representative primary household surveys conducted
by national statistical ofﬁces or by private agencies
under the supervision of govern ment or international
agencies and obtained from govern ment statistical
ofﬁces  and  World  Bank  country  departments.
(Population below US$1.25 a day and Population
below US$2 a day): percentages of the population
living on less than $1.25 a day and $2 a day at 2005
international prices. As a result of revisions in PPP
exchange rates, poverty rates for individual countries
cannot be compared with poverty rates reported in
earlier editions

Level of urbanization: percentage of the population
residing  in  places  classiﬁed  as  urban.  Urban  and
rural settlements are deﬁned in the national context
and vary among countries (the deﬁnitions of urban
are generally national deﬁnitions incorporated within
the latest census).

National population below national poverty line:
percentage of the country’s population living below
the  national  poverty  line.  National  estimates  are
based on population weighted subgroup estimates
from household surveys.

Persons  in  housing  units:  number  of  persons
resident in housing units.

Population,
rural:  mid-year  estimates  and
projections  (medium  variant)  of  the  population
residing in human settlements classiﬁed as rural (see
also ‘Population, urban’ below).

Population,  total:  mid-year  population  estimates
and projections for the world, region, countries or
areas. The Population Division of the United Nations
Department of Economic and Social Affairs updates,
every two years, population estimates and projections
by incorporating new data, new estimates and new
analyses of data on population, fertility, mortality and
international migration. Data from new population
censuses  and/or  demographic  surveys  are  used  to

210

Planning and Design for Sustainable Urban Mobility

verify  and  update  old  estimates  of  population  or
demographic indicators, or to make new ones and
to check the validity of the assumptions made in the
projections. Population rate of change (calculated by
UN-Habitat) refers to the average annual percentage
change of population during the indicated period for
each country, major regions and global totals. The
formula used throughout the annex is as follows: r
= [(1/t) x ln(A2/A1)] x 100, where ‘A1’ is a value at
any given year; ‘A2’ is a value at any given year later
than the year of ‘Al’; ‘t’ is the year interval between
‘Al’ and ‘A2’; and ‘ln’ is the natural logarithm function.
Population,  urban: mid-year  population  of  areas
deﬁned as urban in each country and reported to the
United  Nations.  Estimates  of  the  world’s  urban
population would change signiﬁcantly if China, India,
and a few other populous nations were to change
their deﬁnition of urban centres. According to China’s
State Statistical Bureau, by the end of 1996 urban
residents accounted for about 43 percent of China’s
population,  while  in  1994  only  20  percent  of  the
population was considered urban. In addition to the
continuous migration of people from rural to urban
areas, one of the main reasons for this shift was the
rapid growth in the hundreds of towns reclassiﬁed
as cities in recent years. Because the estimates in
the table are based on national deﬁnitions of what
constitutes a city or metropolitan area, cross-country
comparisons should be made with caution.
Population density: mid-year population divided by
land area in square kilometres.
Pump price for fuels: refer to the pump prices of
the most widely sold grade of petrol and of diesel
fuel.  Prices  have  been  converted  from  the  local
currency to US dollars.
Railways: length of railway route available for train
service, irrespective of the number of parallel tracks.
Passen gers  carried  by  railway  are  the  number  of
passen gers  (in  millions)  transported  by  rail  multi-
plied by kilometres travelled (m-p-km). Goods hauled
by railway are the volume of goods transported by
railway,  measured  in  metric  tons  multiplied  by
kilometres travelled (m-t-km).
Road motor vehicles: include cars, buses and freight
vehicles but not two-wheelers.
Road trafﬁc deaths: any person killed immediately
or dying within 30 days as a result of a road trafﬁc
accident.
Passen ger cars: refer to road motor vehicles, other
than  two-wheelers,  intended  for  the  carriage  of
passen gers and designed to seat no more than nine
people (including the driver). Other motor vehicles:
road motor vehicles exclusive of passen ger cars.

Roads: motorways, highways, main or national roads,
and secondary or regional roads. A motorway is a road
specially designed and built for motor vehicles that
separates the trafﬁc ﬂowing in opposite directions.
Total road network: includes motorways, highways
and  main  or  national  roads,  secondary  or  regional
roads, and all other roads in a country. Paved roads:
roads surfaced with crushed stone (macadam) and
hydrocarbon  binder  or  bitumized  agents,  with
concrete or with cobblestones, as a percentage of all
of the country’s roads measured in length. Passen -
gers carried by roads are the number of people (in
millions) transported by road multiplied by kilometres
travelled  (m-p-km).  Goods  hauled  by  road  are  the
volume  of  goods  transported  by  road  vehicles,
measured  in  millions  of  metric  tons  multiplied  by
kilometres travelled (m-t-km).
Survey year: the year in which the underlying data
were collected.
Urban  poverty  rate:  percentage  of  the  urban
population living below the national urban poverty
line.
Urban  slum  dwellers:  individuals  residing  in
housing with one or more of the following conditions:
inadequate  drinking  water;  inadequate  sanitation;
poor  structural  quality/durability  of  housing;  over -
crowding; and insecurity of tenure.
Urban  agglomerations  and  capital  cities:  the 
term ‘urban agglomeration’ refers to the population
contained  within  the  contours  of  a  contiguous
territory inhabited at urban density levels without
regard  to  administrative  boundaries.  It  usually  in -
corporates the population in a city or town plus that
in  the  suburban  areas  lying  outside  of  but  being
adjacent to the city boundaries. Whenever possible,
data  classiﬁed  according  to  the  concept  of  urban
agglomeration are used. However, some countries do
not produce data according to the concept of urban
agglomeration but use instead that of metropolitan
area or city proper. If possible, such data are adjusted
to conform to the concept of urban agglomeration.
When sufﬁcient information is not available to permit
such an adjustment, data based on the concept of
city proper or metropolitan area are used. The sources
listed  online  indicate  whether  data  were  adjusted 
to conform to the urban agglomeration concept or
whether  a  different  concept  was  used.  Table  C.1
contains  revised  estimates  and  projections  for  all
urban agglomerations comprising 750,000 or more
inhabitants.
