Urban Development Series 

Produced by the World Bank’s Urban Development and Resilience Unit of the Sustainable Development 
Network,  the  Urban  Development  Series  discusses  the  challenge  of  urbanization  and  what  it  will 
mean  for  developing  countries  in  the  decades  ahead.  The  Series  aims  to  explore  and  delve  more 
substantively into the core issues framed by the World Bank’s 2009 Urban Strategy Systems of 
Cities: Harnessing Urbanization for Growth and Poverty Alleviation. Across the ﬁve domains of 
the  Urban  Strategy,  the  Series  provides  a  focal  point  for  publications  that  seek  to  foster  a  better 
understanding of (i) the core elements of the city system, (ii) pro-poor policies, (iii) city economies, 
(iv)  urban  land  and  housing  markets,  (v)  sustainable  urban  environment,  and  other  urban  issues 
germane to the urban development agenda for sustainable cities and communities.

About  3.7  billion  people  now  live  in  urban 
areas, and that number is expected to double 
in  just  50  years.  With  urbanization,  more 
people have access to basic services, literacy, 
good jobs, and longer lives. But urbanization 
also raises concerns about whether cities can 
ﬁnance enormous amounts of infrastructure 
for millions of new citizens, adequately plan 
for land requirements, provide basic services—
and do all of this in a way that strengthens 
social capital, preserves the integrity of the 
Earth’s  ecosystems,  and  prepares  for  the 
shocks of climate change.

We need to assemble what facts we can, and antic-
ipate  how  best  to  proceed  in  the  face  of  uncer-
tainty.  And  we  need  to  build  new  partnerships 
and  strengthen  existing  ones  to  embark  on  the 
challenging journey ahead. 

face  urgent  challenges, 

from 
While  cities 
urbanization  and  climate  change  to  increasing 
global  competitiveness,  inequity,  and  resource 
constraints,  the  opportunity  for  technology  to 
help  address  these  challenges  has  also  never 
been  greater.  Information  and  communications 
technology (ICT) may be able to drive eﬃciency 
gains through better monitoring of infrastructure 
and  more  responsive  services.  The  Climate 
Group’s Smart 2020 report (2008) estimated that, 
globally,  ICT-enabled  solutions  for  smart  grids, 

smart buildings, and smart logistics and industrial 
processes can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 
as much as 7.8 Gt in 2020—a reduction larger than 
total  emissions  produced  by  China  in  2010.  In 
addition, technology is driving integration across 
traditional city department silos. Smart grids are 
bringing  together  our  energy  and  telecommuni-
cation systems, and electric vehicles are connecting 
our transport systems with our energy networks. 

Smart cities are just one of the paradigm shifts that 
will be needed to build sustainability in an urban-
izing  world.  This  paper,  the  ﬁrst  product  of  the 
Partnership for Sustainable Cities, presents a wide 
range  of  approaches  for  the  diﬀerent  aspects  of 
urban sustainability. The focus is on how to opera-
tionalize this knowledge, especially for developing-
country cities. 

The world’s headlong rush to urbanize is now half 
complete. The next 10 years are critical; as managers 
and  leaders  build  up  fast-growing  cities,  they  are 
locking  in  humanity’s  and  the  planet’s  future. 
Seemingly small things can have major impacts. This 
report is one such small step for an inﬂuential and 
concerned group of partners. The work is intended 
to help cities—the real drivers of change.

INTRODUCTION

Photo: Curt Carnemark/World Bank

Cities  are  hubs  of  global  change,  and  their 
global  inﬂuence  continues  to  grow.  Cities 
contribute  signiﬁcantly  to  global  challenges 
like climate change and biodiversity loss. At 
the  same  time,  cities  experience  impacts 
like  climate  change  ﬁrst  and  with  greatest 
intensity. Further, cities are becoming leaders 
worldwide in efforts to address global environ-
mental and social problems.  

Some  of  the  most  important  smaller-scale  agree-
ments and partnerships emerging from Rio+20 (the 
United  Nations  Conference  on  Sustainable  Devel-
opment) were initiated by or focused on cities. Even 
as the conference reinforced the increasing diﬃculty 
of reaching consensus on global challenges, it also 
saw  smaller-scale  agreements  and  partnerships 
emerge.  Some  of  the  most  important  “microag-
reements”  focused  on  cities.  For  example  the  host 
city of Rio de Janeiro unveiled its own low-carbon 
growth strategy.

The  impacts  of  city-level  agreements  will  not 
necessarily  be  smaller  than  those  of  national 
accords.  Many  of  the  concrete  steps  toward 
sustainable development can and must be enacted 
by municipal governments— for example eﬃcient 
and adaptive building standards, public transpor-
tation,  “smart”  power  grids  or  ﬂood  protections. 
The Rio summit itself identiﬁed sustainable cities 

as one of seven critical issues in coming decades. 
And  the  other  six—adequate  jobs,  energy,  food 
security  and  sustainable  agriculture,  water, 
oceans,  and  disaster  readiness  and  resilience—
demand solutions that will be conceived, piloted, 
and mainstreamed mainly in cities.

Developments  in  Rio  showcased  the  pragmatism 
and  enthusiasm  associated  with  sustainable  cities. 
Reviewing  progress  since  the  ﬁrst  UN  Conference 
on Environment and Development 20 years before, 
Rio+20  found  some  remarkable  improvements, 
notably  in  recognition  of  the  role  played  by  local 
governments,  their  willingness  to  cooperate  and 
eagerness  to  share  information,  and  the  emerging 
synergy  between  research,  business  and  the  public 
sector.  The  initiatives  announced  at  Rio  followed 
several  regional  partnerships  on  cities  and  climate 
change  in  places  such  as  Germany,  Australia  and 
Mexico (Newman and Jennings 2008). 

Cities  are  increasingly  recognized  as  a  priority 
for inclusive green growth, particularly in rapidly 
growing cities where it is essential to avoid locking 
in  ineﬃcient  urban  forms.  Moving  forward, 
further  solidifying  relationships  among  partners 
and  local  governments  is  critical.  The  issue  of 
cities  and  climate  change  has  been  explored  by 
academics,  policy  makers  and  private  sector 
entities  (Hoornweg,  Freire,  et  al.  2011).  There  is 

BUILDING SUSTAINABILITY IN AN URBANIZING WORLD

now  ample  evidence  to  conﬁrm  the  impacts  of 
urban  spatial  forms,  operations  and  governance 
on  greenhouse  emissions  and  to  demonstrate 
eﬀective  strategies  for  climate  change  mitigation 
and  adaptation.  Substantial  work  toward  quanti-
fying  how  cities  “metabolize”  resources  and 
obtain  clear  indicators  that  facilitate  strategies 
to  compare  and  monitor  policy  eﬀectiveness  is 
available. Private sector partners want to harness 
the  extraordinary  opportunities  for  innovation 
and  business  development  in  cities,  while  both 
public  and  private  partners  are  closely  engaged 
with  city  administrations.  Existing  experiences, 
toolkits and technologies that have been tested in 
cities around the world are ever more in demand. 
Dialogue  among  cities  and  the  kinds  of  partner-
ships that are developing from Rio+20 have never 
been more relevant than they are today.

Among the urban partners emerging in recent years, 
the foremost are cities themselves and their national 
representatives;  agencies  and  networks  such  as 
C40, ICLEI Local Governments for Sustainability, 
United Cities and Local Governments (UCLG) and 
Metropolis; the Climate and Clean Air Coalition, 
a  group  of  national  government  representatives; 
multilateral development banks such as the Inter-
American Development Bank, Asian Development 
Bank, and the World Bank; UN-Habitat; the United 
Nations  Environmental  Programme;  the  World 
Federation  of  Engineering  Organizations;  private-
sector  companies; 
the  academic  community; 
philanthropic  organizations  like  the  Rockefeller 
Foundation and the Clinton Climate Initiative; and 
technical agencies like the Green Building Council 
and the Climate Development Program.

To  support  this  movement,  the  World  Bank 
initiated the Partnership for Sustainable Cities, a 
group  of  leading  urban  actors  with  a  mission  to 
collaborate on city development around the world 
and foster city-led sustainable development. This 
synthesis  paper  is  a  product  of  the  partnership’s 
early discussions. 

About the Partnership 

The Partnership for Sustainable Cities aims to bring 
together  actors  in  the  private  sector,  academia, 
and international ﬁnancial institutions (IFIs), and 
to help coordinate their eﬀorts to build inclusive, 
sustainable and resilient cities. The Bank and other 
partners  are  well  positioned  to  provide  technical 
and ﬁnancial backing for these eﬀorts. 

The  idea  of  such  a  partnership  started  as  early 
as  2009  and  was  cemented  during  a  seminar  in 
Washington,  DC,  in  June  2011.  Attended  by  70 
representatives of private companies, international 
organizations, academic institutions and the World 
Bank, the workshop invited participants to share 
their  ongoing  programs  related  to  sustainable 
cities,  to  consider  establishing  a  partnership  for 
exchanging information, and to discuss the need 
for  common  tools  and  case  studies.  Three  key 
questions  were  proposed:  What  do  we  need  to 
know?  How  do  we  take  into  account  the  varied 
characteristics  of  cities  in  developing  countries? 
And what is the role of indicators in the context of 
city sustainability?

The June 2011 meeting and follow-on discussions 
were rich in ideas and consensus, as participants 
came to agree on an agenda for collaboration. The 
participants saw clear beneﬁts from a partnership 
of local governments and institutions interested in 
sustainable  cities,  and  anticipated  sharing  infor-
mation, experiences and lessons learned. 

Individual  partners  committed  to  pursue  several 
speciﬁc  initiatives,  including  a  compendium  of 
data  on  the  world’s  100  largest  cities  (Chapter 
5),  a  sustainability  rating  tool  for  infrastructure, 
and  other  projects  (Chapter  8).  More  generally, 
the  group  agreed  to  learn  more  about  existing 
solutions,  examine  the  role  of  the  private  sector, 
explore opportunities to cooperate, deﬁne common 
approaches, and monitor progress toward the goals 
set at the meeting.

About This Report 

The report is organized into eight chapters:

In  this  discussion  paper,  members  of  the 
partnership  have  collaborated  to  identify  and 
analyze the issues that guide their work together. 
The  report  summarizes  the  sustainability  issues 
faced  by  cities  and  points  toward  the  road 
ahead.  It  reviews  successes  in  policy  as  well  as 
investment, and discusses what is needed to reach 
out to the rapidly growing cities of the developing 
world and make them eﬀective users of existing 
knowledge. Examples of programs established by 
the  partners  are  described  in  both  the  text  and 
the Annexes. 

Compiled  from  the  contributions  of  over  40 
authors, this document should not be considered 
a  comprehensive  synthesis,  but  rather  a  work 
in  progress.  It  is  an  input  for  dialogue  across 
sectors  and  for  framing  a  loose  partnership 
platform. The report and its writing process also 
exemplify the partnership’s eﬀorts to coordinate 
multiple stakeholders and help them create more 
sustainable  cities  through  a  series  of  constantly 
evolving actions. By working together in the devel-
opment of this paper, the partners established a 
common understanding of the key elements of a 
strategy  for  urban  sustainability.  This  supports 
the  partnership’s  central  mission: 
fostering 
worldwide  collaboration  on  city-led  sustainable 
development. 

This report aims to be useful to the partners who 
contributed with knowledge and experiences, to 
cities who may beneﬁt from an honest discussion 
of  what  works  and  what  needs  improvement, 
and to businesses and development practitioners 
entering the wide world of sustainable cities. 

Chapter 1 discusses urbanization and the growing 
global impact of cities, reviews the widely accepted 
deﬁnitions  of  sustainability  and  sustainable 
cities,  and  elaborates  on  the  need  for  innovative 
approaches to the various aspects of sustainability.

Chapter 2 reviews the importance of urbanization 
for  economic  growth  and  the  opportunity  for 
low-carbon  investments  to  promote  growth  and 
job creation in developing countries. 

Chapter  3  discusses  the  ways  in  which  policies 
dealing  with  land  and  urban  form  can  promote 
greener  growth,  as  well  as  how  cities  can  take 
advantage  of  the  enormous  demand  for  infra-
structure  to  become  cleaner  and  more  eﬃcient. 
It summarizes issues related to energy eﬃciency, 
buildings, urban transport, water, and waste. 

Chapter 4 discusses climate change adaptation in 
cities.  Approaches  for  local  adaptation  planning, 
risk management and resilience are reviewed. 

Chapter 5 debates how to measure improvements in 
urban sustainability. It reviews the framework of urban 
metabolism  for  understanding  the  ﬂow  of  materials 
and  energy,  and  explores  the  use  of  indicators  to 
measure aspects of sustainability—including risks and 
resilience as well as eﬃciency. A new compendium of 
data from the world’s 100 largest urban areas is intro-
duced, and a basic typology of these cities is presented. 

Chapter  6  discusses  the  roles  of  diﬀerent  institu-
tions  in  the  governance  and  implementation  of 
sustainable cities, and Chapter 7 considers how insti-
tutions can contribute to learning and innovation.  

Chapter  8  suggests  next  steps  to  move  toward 
sustainable  cities, 
identifying  possible  paths 
forward with partners.

BUILDING SUSTAINABILITY IN AN URBANIZING WORLD

Sustainable Development in the Urban Century

Key Messages 
 (cid:96) Sustainable cities are critical to sustainable development, given their position as engines of 
economic growth, centers of population growth and resource consumption, and crucibles of 
culture and innovation. 

 (cid:96) Cities must adopt sustainable development policies as soon as possible because today’s infra-

structure investments will be locked in for hundreds of years. This is all the more urgent in 
developing countries that are rapidly urbanizing.

 (cid:96) Sustainable cities should be deﬁned broadly, integrating environmental, economic, and social 

objectives, and should be supported with a comprehensive and customizable how-to menu.

 (cid:96) Making cities sustainable requires addressing knowledge gaps, broadening participation 

across stakeholders, and incentivizing behavioral change at the individual, corporate, and local 
government levels.

As  the  environmentalist  Lester  Brown  warned 
decades ago, a pond that will be covered by the 
exponential growth of water lilies in 30 days is 
only half covered on the 29th day (Brown 1978). 
So we stand today with urbanization. Almost all 
the  growth  that  cities  have  experienced  in  the 
last 200 years is about to double in the next 40 
to 50 years (see Box 1 and Annex 1). Much of 
this growth will take place in low- and middle-
income  cities,  where  80  percent  of  the  world’s 
urban population is expected to reside in 2020. 
Africa,  Asia,  and  Latin  America  will  be  home 
to  a  majority  of  the  world’s  urban  population, 
while  Europe,  North  America,  and  Oceania’s 
shares  are  projected  to  decline  steadily  until 
2050 (Figure 1). 

Since  the  ﬁrst  humans  began  living  in  groups 
that stayed in place while they tended crops and 
livestock, ours has been a history of urbanization. 
Today’s  big  problems—climate  change,  ﬁnancial 
shocks,  biodiversity  loss,  soil  degradation,  civil 
unrest, potential pandemics, wars, and strife over 

resources—are in part the by-products of this urban-
ization. So, too, are many of humanity’s greatest 
accomplishments—increased 
aﬄuence,  better 
health  and  well-being,  longer  life  expectancy, 
culture  and  the  arts,  technological  and  creative 
innovation,  and  reducing  the  number  of  people 
living  in  extreme  poverty  from  1,818  million  in 
1990 to 1,374 million in 2005.1

Cities as permanent places of residence are as old 
as  civilization  itself.  Damascus,  for  example,  is 
believed to have been continuously inhabited since 
9,000  B.C.  Contrast  this  to  companies,  and  even 
countries,  which  come  and  go.  The  average  life 
expectancy of a Fortune 500 company is a mere 40 
to 50 years.2 Of today’s 194 sovereign states, only 
nine  have  existed  freely  and  continuously  since 
before  1800.  The  size  and  economic  might  of  a 
city  may  ebb  and  ﬂow,  but  its  connection  to  the 
land  and  integration  with  natural  ecosystems  is 
relatively permanent. Cities are the physical places

Drivers of Urbanization

The  sheer  magnitude  of  population  and  investments 
in  urban  areas,  combined  with  the  suite  of  services 
required to support them, make cities intricate, complex 
systems  with  equally  complex  problems.  In  order  to 
address these problems, it is important to understand 
the  drivers  of  urbanization  and  how  these  affect  the 
vulnerability of the city system to global change. 

In simple terms, urbanization is the result of a move-
ment  of  people  from  rural  areas  to  urban  areas 
(Sattherthwaite  et  al.  2009),  both  within  their  own 
countries  and  trans-nationally.  The  underlying  cause 
is attraction to economic, cultural, social, and educa-
tional opportunities, along with the quality of life that 
a city provides. 

Rapidly urbanizing nations have a history of economic 
expansion  and  a  shift  in  employment  patterns  from 
rural, agricultural, or pastoral activities to industrial, 
service-oriented,  or  knowledge-based  activities.  As 
a  result  of  such  trends,  by  2004,  97  percent  of  the 

3

world’s gross domestic product (GDP) was generated 
by industry and services (Sattherthwaite et al. 2009). 
Thus,  people  evidently  are  moving  toward  the  job 
opportunities offered in cities for a higher quality of 
life, which involves a higher salary and less physically 
labor-intensive jobs. 

Yet  this  is  a  simplistic  generalization,  as  some  of  the 
world’s largest cities (for example, Buenos Aires, Kolkata, 
Mexico City, Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, and Seoul) have 
had more people leaving than moving to the city during 
their most recent census periods. Counterexamples like 
these  illustrate  the  importance  of  location-  and  time-
speciﬁc  studies  and  data  gathering  to  inform  policy 
making at the national level. It is also important to recog-
nize  that  cities  are  dynamic  systems—growing,  pros-
pering, or declining according to macroeconomic policies, 
international trade regimes, shifting national and inter-
national migration patterns, and impacts from disasters 
such as earthquakes, droughts, or wars (Sattherthwaite 
et al. 2009).

BUILDING SUSTAINABILITY IN AN URBANIZING WORLD

where we live, or want to; countries and companies 
are what we create largely to protect and serve our 
cities. 

The  only  path  to  sustainable  development  is 
through sustainable cities (see Box 2). Yet most of 
the  world’s  media  and  political  leadership  focus 
on  national  and  international  geopolitical  issues: 
the  economic  crises  in  Europe,  climate  change, 
the  Arab  Spring,  the  “war  on  terror,”  China’s 
ascendancy. We are very good at discussing global 
symptoms. Arguably, over the last several decades, 
while the world attended to economic growth and 
geopolitical dynamics, the exponential growth of 
cities (Figure 2) went largely unnoticed. 

Only in the last 10 to 15 years have cities and urban-
ization  entered  the  common  political  and  policy 
discourse.  This  will  be  an  urban  century,  and  the 
potential  for  poorly  designed  and  rapidly  growing 
cities  is  a  crucial  challenge  to  sustainable  devel-
opment. While some see the speed of urbanization 
as  a  threat  to  the  carrying  capacity  of  our  planet, 
others  emphasize  the  need  “to  envision  human 
settlements in more positive ways, ﬁrst to reduce per 
capita impacts but then to move to a new and more 
exciting possibility where cities begin to be a positive 
force for the ecological regeneration of their regions” 
(Newman  and  Jennings  2008).  The  discussion  on 
urbanization, and the potential threats and opportu-
nities it presents, is starting in earnest.

Key Concepts for Urban Sustainability

(cid:3)(cid:96) Green growth refers to making growth processes 
more  resource  efﬁcient,  cleaner,  and  more  resil-
ient, without necessarily slowing them (Hallegate 
et al. 2011). The focus is on what must happen over 
the next 5–10 years, before the world gets locked 
into patterns that would be prohibitively expensive 
and  complex  to  modify.  The  short  and  the  long 
term  can  be  reconciled  by  offsetting  short-term 
costs  and  maximizing  synergies  and  economic 
co-beneﬁts,  green  growth  “shifts  the  production 
frontier  by  promoting  innovation  and  harnessing 
potential  synergies  across  sectors”  (Hallegate  et 
al. 2011). Green policies that can be used to capture 
these  co-beneﬁts  include  price-based  policies, 
norms and regulation, public production and direct 
investment,  information  dissemination,  education 
and moral suasion, industrial policies, and innova-
tion policies. 

(cid:3)(cid:96) Green cities are seriously committed to becoming 
environmentally  responsible.  Many  have  under-

taken  internal  environmental  audits  to  under-
stand the impact of their policies, and many have 
become  certiﬁed  under  the  European  Union’s 
Econ-Management and Audit Scheme. Cities such 
as  Den  Haag  and  London  have  calculated  their 
ecological footprints and are using these measures 
as policy benchmarks (Beatley 2007).

(cid:3)(cid:96) Smart cities have adopted technical and informa-
tion  platforms  to  better  manage  the  use  of  their 
resources,  improve  management,  monitor  devel-
opments, develop new business models, and help 
citizens to make informed decisions about the use 
of resources. 

(cid:3)(cid:96) Resilient  cities  have  the  ability  to  respond  to 
natural  disasters  and  system  shocks,  and  can 
provide reliable services under a wide set of unpre-
dictable circumstances. These are cities that have 
built-in systems, such as diverse transport and land 
use, that can adapt to change (Newman 2009).

BUILDING SUSTAINABILITY IN AN URBANIZING WORLD

Local Impacts, Global Change

As  the  world  has  become  more  urbanized,  the 
importance of urbanization and density for growth 
and  prosperity  has  become  widely  accepted. 
Currently,  urbanized  areas  host  more  than  half 
the  of  world’s  6.7  billion  people  and  account  for 
70  percent  of  the  world’s  GDP.  They  are  seen 
as  engines  of  growth,  contributing  to  poverty 
reduction,  improved  living  conditions,  cultural 
development, and knowledge generation. 

cities  will  continue  to  become  more  important  as 
consumers  of  non-renewable  resources  (see  Box  3) 
and as contributors to greenhouse gas emissions. 

Consequently, global agreements that seek to tackle 
threats  such  as  climate  change,  ozone  depletion, 
or  hazardous  waste  must  integrate  cities  as  key 
players.  Cities  generally  delegate  and  empower 
their national governments to negotiate and exert 
inﬂuence on their behalf, but the resulting agree-
ments by and large fall on cities to implement. 

Yet cities also aﬀect the lion’s share of global and local 
environmental problems. Cities account for approxi-
mately 70 percent of energy-related carbon emissions 
worldwide,  and  this  is  expected  to  increase  to  76 
percent by 2030, with most of the increase coming 
from  rapidly  urbanizing  countries  such  as  China 
and India. By 2050, urban dwellers are expected to 
exceed 70 percent of the global population. Hence, 

In  the  ﬁeld  of  green  development,  a  number  of 
multilateral  institutions  such  as  the  World  Bank, 
the  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and 
Development  (OECD),  and  the  United  Nations 
Environmental  Programme  (UNEP),  as  well  as 
private  sector  actors  such  as  McKinsey,  Siemens, 
IBM, and Cisco, have begun focusing on the design 
and  eﬃciency  of  cities.  Economic  development 

Finding the Energy for Growing Economies 

 

3
X
O
B

Most cities in the northern hemisphere recognize that 
energy costs will increase as the demand for energy 
rises  in  the  rapidly  growing  economies  of  the  global 
South.  Developed  country  cities  will  likely  adapt  to 
this  new  scenario  by  reducing  energy  use,  and/or 
innovating to make available new, sustainable energy 
resources. Regulatory frameworks or new policies are 
intended to provide the right incentives for structural 
change, focusing on knowledge generation and service 
provision rather than industrial production. Mixed-use 
neighbourhoods and interconnected systems/grids to 
handle communications, energy, waste and transport 
will also be encouraged. Ultimately we would expect a 
transition from systems that depend on the linear use 
of  resources,  to  highly  interconnected  systems  that 
encourage the circular use of scarce resources.

This transition will require technical and social innova-
tion. Grids of communication, energy, water, transport 
and  monitoring  sensors  (components  of  the  stereo-

typical  smart  city)  will  create  intelligent,  self-healing 
properties  resulting  in  improved  transport  logistics 
with  less  congestion,  high-efﬁciency  resource  ﬂows, 
and  reduced  costs  and  environmental  impact.  Eco-
innovation will help cities of the developed world to be 
sustainable, while creating the conditions for substan-
tial improvement in the urban well-being. 

The cities of the global south face a far more compli-
cated  challenge.  They  too  must  ﬁnd  sustainable 
energy—and  more  of  it—as  rapidly  growing,  young 
and increasingly afﬂuent populations demand more 
energy  to  support  industry  and  the  consumer  life-
style.  However,  these  cities  are  growing  exponen-
tially,  unlike  the  stable  cities  of  the  global  north. 
Informal  settlers  who  are  unable  to  ﬁnd  housing  in 
the  main  city  settle  beyond  organized  boundaries, 
often in marginal and under-serviced areas without 
access  to  energy,  clean  water,  transport,  education, 
and health and sanitation services.

requires the capacity to welcome a growing number 
of  urban  inhabitants  without  increasing  disaster 
risks and environmental degradation. In economic 
terms, sustainable cities attempt to maximize and 
share  the  large  economic  beneﬁts  from  increased 
population  concentration  (Ciccone  2002;  Ciccone 
and  Hall  1996;  World  Bank  2009),  while  trying 
to  avoid  its  negative  externalities  (for  example, 
congestion, 
loss  of  resources,  pollution,  and 
natural  disaster  risks).  City  design  will  be  central 
to our ability to rise to society’s greatest challenges, 
namely encouraging growth, reducing poverty, and 
increasing  living  standards  while  minimizing  the 
consumption of scarce resources. 

Fortunately, cities can be eﬃcient vehicles for sustain-
ability, as leaders are close to their citizens and are 
able  to  directly  implement  much-needed  policy 
changes on the ground. Key segments of the green 
economy agenda such as buildings, city form, energy, 
solid waste, and urban transport are usually under 
the responsibility of the local or regional authority. 

Innovation  and  eﬃciency  may  also  come  more 
naturally in cities. Their high population density 
and  compactness  can  allow  for  economies  of 
scale  and  collaboration.  They  combine  a  mix  of 
specialization and diversity derived from a concen-
tration  of  people  and  economic  activity  that 
generate a fertile environment for competition and 
innovation in ideas, technologies, and processes.3
They  produce  and  distribute  the  resources  that 
provide  better  livelihoods  for  urban  and  rural 
residents  alike.  Indeed,  there  is  already  evidence 
that resource-eﬃcient innovations are being scaled 
up  in  cities,  both  in  developed  and  developing 
countries.  This  is  because  cities  connect  a  wide 
range  of  agents  and  assets,  including  workers, 

3Take, for example, specialized restaurants. A large town can cater for spe-
cialized tastes and employ specialized chefs and specialized suppliers, invit-
ing competition and attracting innovation and immigration by discerning 
clientele. By contrast, a small town will not have met the threshold demand 
size  to  make  a  specialist  restaurant  proﬁtable,  and  most  eating  establish-
ments will cater to a range of tastes by employing generalist chefs, who use a 
single supplier and appeal to the lowest common denominator.

infrastructure,  consumers,  technologies,  resource 
ﬂows, suppliers, cultures, and histories. 

On the other hand, their size and economic complexity 
mean that city-speciﬁc problems such as congestion, 
waste,  pollution,  education,  and  crime  require 
considered  public  intervention.  Indeed,  cities  are 
constrained by many of the same forces as sovereign 
states;  the  growing  complexity  of  global  systems  is 
taxing current political structures at all levels. 

However, cities are also able to act more indepen-
dently  and  often  are  able  to  focus  nascent 
leadership  and  the  concerns  of  local  residents. 
Eﬀorts  to  reduce  smoking  and  trans-fats  in  food 
can  be  catalyzed  by  vanguard  cities.  Saving  the 
blueﬁn  tuna  will  probably  require  a  city  to  step 
forward and ban their sale. New social norms such 
as gay marriage are often initiated by and in cities. 
This  potential  for  cities  to  lead  wider  change  is 
often obvious only in retrospect. In the Agenda 21 
agreement from the 1992 Rio Earth Summit, the 
chapter on local government was the shortest, but 
led  to  more  action  in  the  last  20  years  than  any 
other chapter. 

Locking In Green Growth

The  need  for  urban  leadership  is  all  the  more 
urgent because choices made today will be multi-
plied over the next century or more. Approximately 
2.3 billion people will move into cities within just 
the next four decades (United Nations 2011), and 
those  people  will  need  new  infrastructure  (see 
Box  4  and  Table  1).    The  demand  for  housing 
and  oﬃce  space  will  continue  to  exceed  supply, 
leading  to  more  informality  and  slum  dwellings, 
in the absence of vigorous policies to expand the 
supply of aﬀordable solutions. China will double 
its housing stock between 2000 and 2015, and has 
already built some 40,000 highway miles in just the 
last 10 years. India is rapidly matching this growth. 
Energy consumption in developing countries will 
also increase sharply (IEA and OECD 2010).

Can Infrastructure Keep Up 
with Demand? 

The rising demand for urban infrastructure—
housing,  water,  transport  and  energy—is  a 
massive challenge for developing countries, 
both  from  an  environmental  and  ﬁnancial 
point of view. It is estimated that yearly invest-
ments of $1–1.5 trillion would be needed for 
developing  countries  to  satisfy  basic  needs 
and  provide  infrastructure  for  sustained 
growth  (EIB  2010).  Currently,  infrastructure 
investments  (public  or  private)  represent 
perhaps  half  that  amount.  Financing  for 
maintenance and efﬁcient management has 
often proven elusive, and attempts to attract 
private  investors  have  had  limited  success, 
except in a few countries.

Emerging  economies  that  have  to  build  the 
bulk  of  their  infrastructure  in  the  next  two  or 
three decades will be committing to either high- 
or 
low-resource-intensity  development  paths. 
Urban infrastructure such as buildings, transport 
systems, or water systems generally has a lifetime 
of  at  least  100  years.  In  addition,  the  location 
of  infrastructure  and  building  sites  shapes  the 
footprint of the city and its populations beyond 
the structure’s lifetime (Gusdorf, Hallegatte, and 
Lahellec  2008;  Gusdorf  and  Hallegatte  2007). 
And urban policies are multiplied not only over 
time,  but  socially.  Most  policy  decisions  aﬀect 
social networks in which individuals’ decisions on 
where to live, where to work, and how to commute 
have  powerful  eﬀects  on  others,  entrenching 
attitudes toward, for example, bicycling or living 
near the city center. 

city structures calls for long-term planning based 
on long-term outcomes—often politically diﬃcult, 
but essential for sustainability. Although changing 
course  later  on  is  a  possibility,  the  costs  of  such 
reversal would be enormous. 

While more data and studies are required to under-
stand  the  eﬀectiveness  of  alternative  approaches, 
cities  and  their  administrations  cannot  aﬀord  to 
wait for perfect information before making these 
sensitive  decisions.  Getting  it  right  the  ﬁrst  time 
can, in fact, accelerate urban economic growth in 
developing  countries.  Unfortunately,  sustainable 
choices  can  be  very  diﬃcult  to  fund,  given  the 
scarcity of resources and unmet demands for basic 
services. 

Deﬁning Sustainable Cities 

Thus,  fast-expanding  cities  in  the  developing 
world  present  a  window  of  opportunity.  The 
choices that are made in the next few decades will 
determine the structure that prevails in these cities 
for  centuries.  High-intensity  development  paths 
require less careful planning and are likely to be 
cheaper  in  the  short  run,  but  extremely  costly 
in the medium to long term. The high inertia of 

How do we know if a city is on track for “sustainable 
development”? That term was ﬁrst deﬁned in the 
report  Our  Common  Future  (World  Commission  on 
Environment and Development 1987), also known 
as the Brundtland Commission report. The report’s 
widely used deﬁnition is: “Meeting the needs of the 
present without compromising the ability of future 
generations to meet their own needs.”

Engineer’s Deﬁnition  
of a Sustainable System 

To an engineer, a sustainable system is “one that is either 
in equilibrium, or one that changes slowly at a tolerable 
rate.” This concept of sustainability is best illustrated by 
natural ecosystems, which consist of nearly closed loops 
that change slowly. For example, in the food cycle of plants 
and animals, plants grow in the presence of sunlight, mois-
ture and nutrients and are then consumed by insects and 
herbivores that, in turn, are eaten by successively larger 
animals.  The  resulting  natural  waste  products  replenish 
nutrients,  which  allow  plants  to  grow  and  the  cycle  to 
begin again. If humans are to achieve sustainable devel-
opment, we will have to adopt patterns that reﬂect these 
natural processes. The model of a closed-loop ecosystem 
was ﬁrst proposed by the World Federation of Engineering 
Organizations  in  a  1990  publication,  and  other  authors 
have since suggested modiﬁcations to this model.

Since 1987 there have been many eﬀorts to explain 
and  elaborate  on  what  sustainable  development 
means,  and  at  present  at  least  two  deﬁnitions  are 
regularly  used.  One  emphasizes  an  engineering-
oriented  formulation  that  considers  material  ﬂows 
and  the  impact  that  human  consumption  and 
production have on the local and global environment 
(see Box 5). A second deﬁnition suggests that sustain-
ability  must  include  a  wider  set  of  characteristics, 
including  social  and  equity  issues,  institutional 
capacity  and  participation,  and  ﬁscal  sustainability. 
In  this  second  deﬁnition,  sustainability  is  often 
described  as  having  three  interdependent  pillars: 
economic,  environmental,  and  social.  For  example, 
the World Bank’s Urban and Resilience Management 
Unit  currently  deﬁnes  sustainable  cities  as  “urban 
communities committed to improving the well-being 
of their current and future residents, while integrating 
economic, environmental, and social considerations.” 

The  connections  between  the  three  pillars  are 
especially  evident  in  cities,  which  function  as 
integrated  systems.  In  some  cities,  environ-
mental  degradation  is  already  an  obstacle  to 

well-being and poverty reduction. Uncontrolled 
urban  development  may  lead  to  a  reduction 
in  soil  permeability  and  drainage  capacity 
that  increases  ﬂood  risks  and  the  economic 
costs  associated  with  them,  such  as  lack  of 
economic  competitiveness  and  poor  well-being. 
It also disproportionately hurts the urban poor, 
especially  those  living  in  informal  settlements, 
reducing their ability to accumulate capital and 
escape poverty (Lall and Deichmann 2011). The 
reverse  is  also  true;  poverty  may  be  a  cause  of 
increased  ﬂood  risks  when  lack  of  resources 
leads  poor  people  to  settle  in  marginal  areas 
with  limited  access  to  basic  services,  where 
drainage infrastructure cannot be extended and 
solid waste disposal is inadequate. 

One useful set of markers for urban sustainability 
is the so-called Melbourne Principles, articulated 
at  a  2002  meeting,  which  attempt  to  include  the 
ecosystem  dimension  as  well  as  the  social  and 
institutional characteristics that aﬀect city perfor-
mance (Table 2). In preparing this report, members 
of the Partnership for Sustainable Cities worked to

argued  that  there  is  a  hierarchy  among  the 
actions  to  be  taken,  as  cities  need  to  focus

other levels of design and governance. Figure 4

develop their own shared sense of what deﬁnes a 
sustainable city and what are its critical building 
blocks.  Participants  in  a  “Deﬁning  Sustainable 
Cities” workshop in 2012 favored a wide concept 
of  sustainability,  going  beyond  environmental 
impacts  alone.  However,  deﬁning  urban  sustain-
ability is a complex task. Any given city’s sustain-
ability is inﬂuenced by its historical and cultural 
context,  its  goals  (livability  or  business  devel-
opment, for example), and its local geography and 
environmental  conditions.  Moreover,  partners 
from diﬀerent sectors preferred diﬀerent deﬁnitions 
of sustainability at the city level. 

Rather than a one-size-ﬁts-all deﬁnition, one can

views  (Figure  3).  The  ﬁgure  lists  key  character-

ability can be measured.

BUILDING SUSTAINABILITY IN AN URBANIZING WORLD

The  hierarchy  framework  draws  from  the  three 
pillars  of  sustainable  development:  economic 
competitiveness,  environmental 
sustainability, 
and social equity. The base of the pyramid repre-
sents the foundation of basic services that all cities 
require. The speciﬁcs are unique for any given city, 
but  in  general  the  foundational  building  blocks 
shown  here  create  an  enabling  environment  that 
encourages  and  drives  progress.  After  putting 
this  foundation  in  place,  cities  expand  quality 
and coverage of service through greater eﬃciency 
and partnerships. Sustainable cites are supported 
through local and global connectivity and a strong 
capacity  for  resilience,  disaster  preparedness, 
and proactive disaster risk reduction. Our under-

standing  of  sustainable  cities  in  this  report  is 
linked with this framework, which aims to provide 
a simple model for a development path toward a 
sustainable city. 

The Urban Ecosystem 

Another  way  of  understanding  what  makes  a  city 
sustainable  is  through  the  analogy  of  the  urban 
ecosystem. A biological ecosystem has been deﬁned 
as  a  community  of  living  things  interacting  with 
nonliving things (Chapin et al. 2002; see also Box 
6).  In  an  urban  ecosystem,  people  are  among  the 
living things, and the buildings, streets, and other 
built structures are among the nonliving things.

Ecosystems and Ecosystem Services

An ecosystem can be described as a natural area that 
functions as a unit consisting of components (such as 
plants, animals, micro-organisms, water, air etc.), and 
the  interactions  between  them.  Functioning  ecosys-
tems are the foundation of human wellbeing and most 
economic  activity,  because  almost  every  resource 
that humankind utilizes on a day-to-day basis relies 
directly  or  indirectly  on  nature.  The  beneﬁts  that 
humans derive from nature are known as ecosystem 
services,  which  can  be  divided  into  four  categories: 
provisioning  services  (what  we  consume  directly), 
regulating  services  (what  protects  us  from  extreme 
events),  cultural  services  (natural  systems  that  we 
use  for  recreation,  religious  or  spiritual  purposes), 
and  supporting  services  (the  underlying  processes 
that deliver the other services). Ecosystem manage-
ment has long been recognized as a key component 
to sustainable development and poverty alleviation, 
with the use of sustainable resource management in 
urban  and  peri-urban  areas  shown  to  provide  liveli-
hoods for communities throughout the world.

The  Urban  Long-Term  Research  Area  (ULTRA) 
program  in  the  United  States  is  now  studying 
the  ecological  ﬂows  and  interactions  in  cities. 
Researchers  at  Boston  University,  for  example, 
have discovered a “weekend eﬀect” on emissions—
a steep dropoﬀ in the amount of carbon dioxide 
entering  the  city’s  atmosphere  on  Saturdays  and 
Sundays.  In  Fresno,  California,  backyard  water 
use increases with wealth, as does backyard biodi-
versity.  In  Los  Angeles,  ecologists  studying  the 
city’s “ecohydrology” have calculated that planting 
a million new trees, an idea with fairly universal 
appeal,  would  have  the  drawback  of  increasing 
water consumption by 5 percent. 

In recent years, an ecosystem approach has become 
more widely used in city management. Adopted by 
the UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) 
(Ibisch,  Vega,  and  Hermann  2010;  Smith  and 
Maltby 2003), the ecosystem approach is a strategy 
for  the  integrated  management  of  land,  water, 
and  living  resources  that  promotes  conservation 
and sustainable use in an equitable way. The rise 
of this type of strategy is due in part to the 2005 
Millennium  Ecosystem  Assessment  (MA  2005), 
which concluded that human impacts on the health 
and  biodiversity  of  world  ecosystems  are  signif-
icant and escalating. In the wake of this report, a 
variety of innovations—breakthroughs in the under-

14

BUILDING SUSTAINABILITY IN AN URBANIZING WORLD

standing of ecosystem dynamics, green paradigms 
in economics (Boxes 7 and 8) and in building design, 
and  new  ﬁnancial  mechanisms—have  allowed  for 
more policymakers, including urban managers, to 
consider taking an ecosystem approach.

Urban management using the ecosystem approach 
recognizes  that  a  city  is  a  component  of  one  or 
more  ecosystems,  and  thus  city  managers  must 

consider  variables  beyond  the  city  borders  when 
deﬁning  and  implementing  policies  (see  Box  9). 
Ecosystem  thinking  can  bring  broad  beneﬁts 
across  the  three  pillars  of  sustainability;  for 
example,  by  highlighting  the  value  of  natural 
capital  and  the  dependence  of  poor  populations 
on  well-functioning  ecosystems  (MA  2005),  it 
helps cities balance socioeconomic concerns with 
environmental protection.

Economic Valuation  
of Ecosystem Services

The  economic  valuation  of  ecosystem 
services  is  an  emerging  science  that  has 
seen  experts  attempt  to  quantify  the 
contribution  of  such  services  to  the  local 
or  national  economy.  While  the  process 
is  challenging,  it  allows  policy  makers  to 
propose  policies  relating  to  the  natural 
environment that can be weighed against 
other competing activities, such as large-
scale 
infrastructure  development.  For 
instance,  in  Chicago,  USA,  urban  trees 
are estimated to provide a service for air 
cleansing  that  is  equivalent  to  US$9.2 
million  dollars,  and  their  long-term  bene-
ﬁts  are  estimated  to  be  more  than  twice 
their costs.

Payments for Ecosystem Services

Economic considerations have helped in the develop-
ment of payments for ecosystem services (PES)—the 
practice of offering transparent, voluntary incentives 
to landowners in exchange for managing their land to 
provide some sort of ecological service. PES programs 
promote the conservation of natural resources in the 
marketplace.

The  ecosystem  services  that  these  schemes  usually 
focus  on  are  climate  change  mitigation,  watershed 
services,  and  biodiversity  conservation,  all  of  which 
are  subject  to  growing  demand.  Some  PES  schemes 
involve  contracts  between  consumers  of  ecosystem 

services  and  the  suppliers  of  these  services,  but  the 
majority are funded by governments and also involve 
intermediaries such as NGOs. The party supplying the 
environmental  services  normally  holds  the  property 
rights  over  an  environmental  good,  which  provides 
a  ﬂow  of  beneﬁts  to  the  demanding  party  in  return 
for  compensation.  In  the  case  of  private  contracts, 
the beneﬁciaries are willing to pay a price that can be 
expected to be lower than their gain in welfare due to 
the services. The providers of the ecosystem services 
can be expected to be willing to accept a payment that 
is greater than the cost of providing the services.

Case Study: Urban Freshwater Resources in Los Angeles

In  1900,  Los  Angeles,  California  obtained  all  of  its 
water  from  the  Los  Angeles  River,  but  population 
growth  (primarily  due  to  in-migration)  caused  the 
city’s  needs  to  exceed  this  local  water  supply  early 
in  the  20th  century.  The  system  was  then  extended 
to  other  water  basins  up  to  hundreds  of  kilometers 
away. The ecological impacts of this expanding water-
supply system have been serious and widespread. By 
the  mid-20th  century,  the  natural  Los  Angeles  River 
ecosystem had become severely degraded by a combi-
nation of agricultural and municipal water use, water 
pollution, and ﬂood control structures. Reduced fresh-
water  inﬂows  have  seriously  degraded  the  wetlands 
and  once-productive  ﬁsheries,  while  other  effects 
included  the  creation  of  dust  storms  that  affected 
local residents.

A series of lawsuits throughout the 1970s and 1980s 
forced the urban authorities to restore ﬂows and wild-
life  habitats,  mitigate  dust  storms,  and  limit  water 
exports  to  allow  lake  elevations  to  return  to  more 
natural  levels.  These  events  marked  the  beginning 
of  a  transition  in  Los  Angeles’  water-supply  sources 
and water demand. Following a lengthy drought from 
1987 through 1992, Los Angeles began to invest seri-
ously in reducing water demand; as a result, per capita 
water  usage  decreased  by  15  percent  between  1985 
and 2000. The city’s population is projected to grow 
from 3.8 million in 2000 to 4.8 million people in 2020 
and future increases in demand are to be met through 
water conservation and recycling.

Resource  eﬃciency—the 
sustainable  use  of 
resources  throughout  their  life  cycle,  including 
extraction,  transport,  consumption,  and  waste 
disposal—is  often  the  primary  goal  for  oﬃcials 
exploring  an 
to  city 
management.  There  is  a  strong  link  between 
natural  resource  management  and  well-being  in 
cities.  Resource  eﬃcient  cities  combine  greater 
productivity and innovation with lower costs and 
reduced environmental impact.

integrated  approach 

With increased pressure on natural resources, city 
policies need to maintain and capitalize on those 
resources. For instance in Melbourne, Australia, a 
network  of  regional  parks,  trails,  foreshores,  and 
waterways  contribute  signiﬁcantly  to  the  city’s 
livability  and  public  health.  Local  park  agencies 
have  partnered  with  a  major  health  insurer  and 
invested over US$1 million in a program for health 
care professionals to encourage people to increase 
physical  activity  by  visiting  and  engaging  in 
activities in these areas (TEEB 2011). In contrast, 

neglect of natural resources can have dire conse-
quences.  Ulaanbaatar,  Mongolia,  depends  on 
the watershed of the Upper Tuul valley, which is 
rapidly  degrading.  The  reduced  availability  of 
water  and  other  ecosystem  services,  business-as-
usual  management,  and  increasing  degradation 
will  result  in  an  estimated  cost  of  $300–500 
million to industry, and reduced economic growth 
prospects for the city over 25 years. 

How Can Cities Be Made  
More Sustainable? 

The  complexity  of  urban  systems  and  the  close 
links  between  economic,  social,  and  environ-
mental  objectives  raise  challenges  in  designing 
good  urban  policies,  as  trade-oﬀs  are  inevitable. 
For  instance,  an  ambitious  economic  strategy  in 
a city may be hindered if the city cannot provide 
low-income  housing  and  adequate 
transpor-
tation  for  workers  who  will  be  attracted  by  jobs. 
Cross-sectoral  cooperation  is  key  for  integrated

economic  development  in  cities.  There  are  also 
signiﬁcant opportunities to bring about equitable 
and inclusive development under the umbrella of 
green growth. The informal sector provides both 
an immense labor resource as well as a market for 
green  services  and  products.  Therefore,  the  job 
opportunities created by green industries can and 
should include the urban poor.

Policies that correct environmental issues may have 
negative  or  positive  side-eﬀects,  leading  to  either 
tradeoﬀs  or  synergies.  For  instance,  a  transpor-
tation  policy  that  decreases  congestion  improves 
inhabitants’  well-being,  enhances  economic  attrac-
tiveness, reduces inequalities in accessibility among 
neighborhoods,  and  lowers  air  pollution.  On 
the  other  hand,  reserving  urban  land  for  public 
parks or green spaces without providing compen-
satory measures may lead to reduced population 
density, increased greenhouse gas emissions from 
transport, and higher land prices. 

These  conﬂicts  create  implementation  problems, 
while  synergies  oﬀer  opportunities  for  win-win 
solutions.  To  identify  and  capitalize  on  these 
opportunities, cities and their partners can: 

 (cid:96) Address Knowledge Gaps. There are massive 
gaps in terms of knowledge, analytics, indicators, 
and local government capacities, particularly for 
dealing  with  complex  issues  on  multiple  times-
cales (see Chapters 5 and 6). The lack of institu-
tional  capacity  will  be  especially  limiting  when 
it comes to choosing among technical packages, 
negotiating  with  suppliers  of  so-called  green 
technology,  and  ensuring  community  partici-
pation when understanding of the global “bads” 
remains minimal. 

 (cid:96) Foster  Participation.  A  city’s  metabolism 
(the ﬂow of materials and energy into and out 
of a city; see Chapter 5) results from the inter-
actions  of  many  stakeholders,  including  city 
oﬃcials, inhabitants, nongovernmental organi-

zations  (NGOs),  and  businesses.  Sustainable 
urban  policies  will  depend  on  the  contribu-
tions of both public and private actors, and on 
incentives  to  guide  individual  private  action, 
including  funding,  innovative  new  technol-
ogies, and sharing of information (see Chapters 
6 and 7).

instance, 
through the provision of information on energy 
cost-saving  measures.  Cities  can  set  their 
long-term  objectives  (for  example,  reduce  20 
percent  of  energy  consumption  over  20  years) 
and help private actors plan and contribute to 
these objectives5. The role of the private sector 
is  particularly  important  in  supplying  greener 
goods  and  services,  retroﬁtting  buildings,  and 
enabling cities to increase density and improve 
the eﬃciency of service delivery (see Chapter 6).

The above interventions require strong institutions 
and an eﬀective regulatory framework, discussed 
in  Chapter  6.  To  motivate  these  institutions  and 
policies,  however,  an  economic  case  needs  to  be 
made  for  sustainable  cities.  The  next  chapter 
explores  how  green  investments  relate  to  urban 
prosperity and growth.

BUILDING SUSTAINABILITY IN AN URBANIZING WORLD

Economics of Green Cities

Key Messages 
 (cid:96) Green policies pay dividends both in the short and long run. They can not only reduce pollution 

and waste but raise well-being and speed economic growth. 

 (cid:96) For example, city form profoundly inﬂuences greenhouse gas emissions and urban sustainability 
as well as economic productivity and efﬁciency. Dense cities that are served by integrated public 
transport systems can have high prosperity with relatively low emissions. 

 (cid:96) While green investments may be proﬁtable, market uncertainty in the short term will require 

support from the public sector to compensate for lack of information.

 (cid:96) An economic downturn may be an ideal time for public investments in sustainability, which can 

boost productivity and employment . 

As  the  world  seeks  to  recover  from  the  2008 
ﬁnancial crisis and the subsequent sovereign debt 
hangover,  the  focus  has  inevitably  shifted  away 
from  designing  climate  policies  and  other  steps 
toward sustainable development. But the need for 
long-term policies is as acute as ever, especially in 
cities that are rapidly building up infrastructure. In 

fact, investing in sustainable choices for cities can 
be economically rewarding, feasible and prudent 
even in a bad economy. Investments and business 
partnerships at the city level will be a crucial ingre-
dient in green growth that reduces poverty while 
protecting natural resources (Box 10).

The Push for Green Growth

Several multilateral institutions have launched initia-
tives  to  address  the  challenges  of  climate  change 
while providing for the needs of some 2 billion poor 
people  (UNEP  2011;  OECD  2011b;  World  Bank  2012a). 
“Green  growth”  is  about  making  growth  processes 
resource-efﬁcient, cleaner and more resilient without 
necessarily slowing them (Hallegate et al. 2011). 

Protecting  the  environment  contributes  to  national 
income in different ways. First, “natural capital” is part 
of  production.  Environmental  conservation  increases 
natural  capital,  and  hence  income.  Second,  environ-
mental  assets  are  generally  prone  to  market  fail-
ures—externalities  and  ill-deﬁned  property  rights  are 
common—and  correcting  these  market  failures  can 
increase  the  effective  supply  of  natural  capital.  It  can 
also improve human well-being directly or indirectly. For 
example,  alleviating  trafﬁc  congestion  directly  reduces 
air  pollution,  but  also  indirectly  improves  the  produc-
tivity and economies of scale typically offered by cities. 

The  UNEP  report  Towards  a  Green  Economy  (UNEP 
2011) shares some encouraging news. First, “investing 
two  percent  of  global  GDP  into  10  key  sectors  could 
kick-start  a  transition  to  a  low  carbon,  resource-efﬁ-
cient Green Economy.”a Second, the shift of resources 
would not only preserve economic growth, but could 
enable  a  higher  growth  rate,  as  it  would  promote 
new  activities  and  increased  job  creation.  Third, 
the  problem  at  stake  involves  more  than  trade-offs 
between growth and environment; it is mostly a “gross 
misallocation  of  capital.”  If  $1.3  trillion  (less  than  10 
percent of the world’s annual investments) were redi-
rected  to  green  investments,  growth  and  poverty 
reduction  would  be  achievable,  while  simultaneously 
promoting a more sustainable economy.b Such a green 
economy is not only relevant in developed  economies 
but is also a catalyst for growth and poverty reduction 
in developing countriesc.

Green growth encompasses not only traditional indus-
tries  that  are  becoming  less  resource-intensive,  but 
also  entirely  new  industries  that  provide  services

such as reducing pollution or producing green power. 
These create new products, new jobs and new collab-
orative  strategies  (OECD  2011b).  Emerging  green 
industries  present  opportunities  for  countries  such 
as China and India, which are now industry leaders in 
wind and solar power, and Brazil, the world leader in 
biofuels.  Morocco  and  other  North  African  countries 
are  investing  heavily  in  concentrated  solar  energy, 
with  the  hope  of  developing  a  domestic  industry.  At 
the city level, the rapid expansion of new towns brings 
enormous opportunities for planning and developing 
denser  and  more  efﬁcient  cities,  improving  urban 
transport  and  preventing  slum  formation.  This  kind 
of  growth  is  compatible  with  the  idea  of  a  green 
economy  that  results  in  improved  human  well-being 
and social equity while signiﬁcantly reducing environ-
mental risks and ecological scarcities. 

a. The 10 sectors include agriculture, buildings, energy supply, ﬁsheries, forestry, industry, including energy efﬁciency, tourism, transport, waste 
management, and water. 
b. This $1.3 billion is roughly equal to the amount of subsidies spent in fossil fuels (UNEP 2010).
c. An investment of 1.25 percent of global GDP each year in energy efﬁciency and renewable energy would cut primary energy demand by 9 
percent in 2020 and 40 percent in 2050. Savings on capital and fuel costs would average $760 million per year between 2010 and 2050. 

20 BUILDING SUSTAINABILITY IN AN URBANIZING WORLD

Urban Density, Efﬁciency,  
and Productivity 

To  address  complex  environmental  problems  while 
sustaining  growing  consumption,  cities  need  to 
consider their urban design and the policies that aﬀect 
spatial form and density. Density has been found to 
aﬀect both productivity and eﬃciency: Some studies 
suggest that, controlling for other factors, a doubling 
of  density  can  add  from  6  percent  to  28  percent 
productivity  (Avent  2011).  In  contrast,  others  argue 
that families ﬂee city centers because of opportunity 
costs from high density—but this may depend on the 
city’s history of spatial development (Box 11), 

In addition, dense cities tend to have lower per-capita 
emissions, provided that they are also served by good 
public  transport  systems  (Hoornweg,  Sugar,  and 
Gomez 2011). Cities with limited urban sprawl and 
integrated  urban  transit  systems,  such  as  Barcelona 
and  Singapore,  have  become  aﬄuent  while  keeping 
their  per  capita  emissions  low  (see  Chapter  5  for  a 
comparison  of  emissions  and  GDP  among  large 
cities). Their relatively low resource intensity is mainly 
a  result  of  greater  transport  energy  eﬃciency  (due 

to  reduced  distances  and  greater  shares  of  public 
transport modes). Burdett (2011) reports that compact 
cities such as Vienna or Barcelona have signiﬁcantly 
higher  population  densities,  higher  public  transport 
use, and correspondingly lower per capita emissions 
than sprawling cities such as Atlanta and Houston. 

Higher  density  also  enables  more  energy-eﬃcient 
heating and cooling in buildings and lower embedded 
energy demand for urban infrastructure. The savings 
in  operating  costs  from  shorter  transport  networks 
and  less  diﬀuse  utility  infrastructure  can  amount  to 
thousands of dollars of annual savings for the average 
household (Litman 2013). And compact, well-managed 
cities  with  intelligent  infrastructure  can  be  more 
attractive to walkers than suburban or rural commu-
nities. Inner-city Barcelona, London, Paris, and Rome, 
together with New York, Singapore, and Tokyo provide 
examples of creative, growing city centers with access 
to a variety of amenities, including green space. 

Historically, urban density (or sprawl) has mostly 
not  been  determined  by  policy.  Some  cities  are 
based on medieval or ancient road plans. Others 
have  been  developed  for  car  travel  on  the  basis 

Do Families Prefer the Suburbs?

Some economists argue that low urban density is pref-
erable based on “hedonic estimation”—that is, people’s 
subjective  preferences.  Families  may  accept  lower 
wages  and  higher  commuting  costs  in  order  to  live 
away from city centers and afford larger living quar-
ters, for example. 

As with all issues of path-dependency, people’s prefer-
ences will depend on how spatial development unfolds 
over  time.  In  cities  such  as  Cleveland,  Pittsburgh, 
Buffalo  or  Detroit  in  the  United  States,  as  in  several 
Latin  American  capitals,  suburban  sprawl  has  drawn 

wealthier  car-owning  families  away  from  inner  cities 
that  can  then  become  run-down,  poor,  and  crime-
ridden  (the  so-called  hollowing-out  effect).  In  other 
cities,  however,  wealthy  people  congregate  in  the 
city centers and tolerate high housing costs precisely 
because  of  a  superior 
living  environment.  This 
supports high-quality housing, amenities and a wealth 
of  cultural  opportunities.  Examples  exist  across  the 
world,  from  Paris  to  Hong  Kong,  Tokyo  to  New  York. 
Nonetheless,  suburban  living  remains  popular,  and 
cities need to be carefully planned in order to attract 
wealth-creating individuals.

of  land-intensive  suburbanization.  Highly  dense 
cities such as Barcelona and Manhattan have had 
their  scope  for  sprawl  limited  by  the  constraints 
of oceans and mountains, as well as strong public 
policy and local interest in compactness. 

eﬃcient public transportation and light rail, as in 
European countries. Lessons from our collective 
experience with urbanization should be used to 
support  developing  cities  that  are  expected  to 
grow exponentially. 

Whatever the reason, once an urban form is chosen 
and locked in it will determine the pattern of a city’s 
resource  intensity  for  decades,  or  even  centuries. 
When  densities  are  too  low,  bike  lanes  or  bus 
systems,  for  example,  become  too  expensive  and 
unappealing. It is probably too late to make Phoenix 
and  Atlanta  eﬃcient,  dense  cities—but  measures 
such as road pricing, bus lanes on highways, electric 
vehicle  infrastructure  and  distributed  low-carbon 
energy  networks  can  reduce  carbon  footprints, 
improve energy eﬃciency and promote innovation 
in resource-intense sprawling cities. Some of these 
cities,  such  as  Los  Angeles,  have  been  able  to 
promote denser forms within the urban core. 

Exogenous  variables  such  as  the  increase  in  fuel 
prices, ﬁnancial crises, and changing cultural and 
generational  tastes  will  strongly  inﬂuence  how 
future cities organize. Most likely, many of those 
factors  will  reinforce  each  other.  For  example, 
the  New  Urbanism  movement  of  the  1990s  has 
insisted  for  decades  on  the  return  to  mixed-use 
residential areas and compact cities (Congress for 
the New Urbanism 2001). These ideas have found 
a fertile ground amidst the planning profession as 
the  hike  in  fuel  prices  has  made  commuting  an 
often unaﬀordable proposition and car-dependent 
suburban  houses  much  less  attractive.  This  was 
the  case  in  Victorville,  100  miles  northeast  of 
downtown  Los  Angeles,  where  inhabitants  were 
entirely  dependent  on  private  cars  to  connect 
homes  to  work  and  services  (Karlenzig  2011). 
With the rise in fuel prices, some of Victorville’s 
suburban neighborhoods have been demolished. 

Many  scholars  predict  the  end  of  sprawl  and 
the  emergence  of  a  decentralized  urban  form, 
based  on  the  replacement  of  the  private  car  by 

Co-beneﬁts of Reducing Greenhouse 
Gas Emissions 

Implementing  sustainability  strategies  often  pays 
short-term  economic  dividends.  Greenhouse  gas 
reduction  plans  can  drive  eﬃciency  and  allow 
cities  to  reduce  waste  and  cut  costs.  Cities  oﬀer 
a  unique  environment  to  innovate,  develop  and 
scale up new ideas and processes, promoting the 
growth of knowledge-intensive green production 
sectors.  Urban  economies  of  scale  oﬀer  the 
opportunity  to  develop  green  investments  such 
as  integrated  public  transit,  sewers  and  water 
systems,  congestion  pricing,  smart  grids,  smart 
buildings  and  decentralized  energy  networks 
(Sedgley, Norman, and Elmslie 2004). Especially 
in  OECD  countries,  some  cities  have  become 
laboratories for action on climate change, in which 
growing  experience  leads  to  further  innovation 
and  lowers  the  cost  of  new  technologies.  Urban 
regions already produce 10 times more renewable 
technology  patents  than  rural  regions  (Kamal-
Chaoui and Roberts 2009, p. 16).

Climate policy also yields other collateral beneﬁts 
at  the  local  level,  and  conversely,  investment  in 
attractive  and  successful  cities  will  yield  climate 
beneﬁts. Low particulate pollution reduces health 
care  costs, 
increases  city  attractiveness,  and 
promotes  competitiveness.  Similarly,  reduced 
waste  makes  for  a  more  attractive  environment 
(with  fewer  and  smaller  landﬁlls,  for  example), 
while  renewable  energy  sources  enhance  energy 
security (Hallegatte et al. 2008). Policies to increase 
vegetation  and  green  spaces  not  only  reduce  the 
heat  island  eﬀect,  but  also  improve  resilience  to 
ﬂooding. Low-carbon transportation means fewer 
traﬃc  jams  and  accidents  as  well  as  cleaner  air

Case Study: Beneﬁts of Bus Rapid 
Transit in Bogotá

Bogotá’s  investment  in  the  Transmilenio  Bus  Rapid 
Transit  system  has  brought 
important  beneﬁts, 
including reduction in travel times, diminished conges-
tion, reduced carbon dioxide emissions, and increased 
mobility  and  access  to  labor  markets  (Montezuma 
2005).  Further,  the  scheme  was  designed  to  connect 
the 13 major slum areas around the capital city. Health 
beneﬁts from green transport strategies are also signif-
icant,  as  they  include  emission  reductions,  increased 
physical  activity  levels,  and  road  safety.  Health  and 
safety  beneﬁts  have  been  estimated  to  exceed  the 
cost  for  integrated  non-motorized  and  public  trans-
port measures by a factor of 5 to 20 times in cities as 
diverse as Bogotá, Delhi, and Morogoro (Dora 2007).

and healthier people (Box 12). Eﬃcient and 
green  cities  are  likely  to  draw  communities 
together as they provide better places to live 
and  generate  economic  prosperity.  Because 
of  these  synergies  between  sustainability 
and livability, the returns to complementary, 
integrated policies are multiplied—the sum is 
greater than the parts.

Incentives, Business Opportunities, 
and Challenges

Opportunities  in  low-carbon  investment  have 
been estimated at $500 (€367) billion per year 
and  rising,  with  clean  energy  investments  in 
2008  totaling  $177  (€130)  billion  (UNEP  and 
New  Energy  Finance  2010;  see  also  Box  13). 
Once new markets are created with supportive 
policies  and  a  favorable  legal  and  regulatory 
environment, innovative businesses can explore 
this  growing  ﬁeld.  New  activities  will  include 
higher-end  business  services,  such  as  environ-
mental  consulting.  Clearly,  opportunities  will 
vary  across  cities  according  to  income  levels, 
human capital, and comparative advantages for 
low-carbon transition.

PART I. WHY URBAN SUSTAINABILITY MATTERS 23

While  public  ﬁnances  remain  stretched  since  the 
economic crisis of 2008, there are suﬃcient private 
resources  that  could  be  invested  in  green  urban 
technology, were it not for the perceived lack of oppor-
tunity and conﬁdence (Romani, Stern, and Zenghelis 
2011).  However,  although  there  is  evidence  that 
green cities and prosperity go hand in hand, private 
companies  acting  in  their  own  self-interest  are  not 
always  best  placed  to  beneﬁt  from  these  synergies. 
Public  incentives  remain  necessary  to  encourage 
greener  practices  and  industries,  as  green  growth 
endeavors may have a number of problems attracting 
investment and producing proﬁts:

 (cid:96) The payback from an up-front investment in energy 
eﬃciency  is  not  immediate,  sometimes  accruing 
beyond political cycles or over uncertain and long 
periods  that  deter  private  investors.  For  eﬃcient 

consumer appliances, even where payback periods 
are short, many buyers face ﬁnancial constraints in 
making the initial investment. 

 (cid:96) These investments also carry signiﬁcant policy-
related  risk,  as  the  ﬁnancial  returns  from 
energy  eﬃciency  will  depend  on  energy  and 
emissions policies. 

 (cid:96) The 

trade-oﬀs  between  more  expensive 
renewable energy and less expensive polluting 
fuels  are  diﬃcult  to  measure  or  quantify, 
and  consumers  may  be  inclined  to  favor  the 
cheapest solution in the short-run. 

 (cid:96) Proﬁtable investments may be precluded by low 
liquidity and lack of capital to ﬁnance upfront 
investment and compensate for short-run losses. 

Clean Energy Investments Surging

Even  in  the  present  uncertain  environment,  with  a 
lack  of  ambitious  and  coordinated  global  green  poli-
cies, investment in renewable energy generation and 
energy efﬁciency is surging. 

(cid:3)(cid:96) Investment  in  this  sector  has  quadrupled  since 
2004,  according  to  Bloomberg  New  Energy 
Finance (BNEF) (Zenghelis 2011c). New investment 
in  clean  energy  surpassed  investment  in  conven-
tional energy generation in 2010, rising to between 
$180 and $200 billion. 

(cid:3)(cid:96) Two  of  the  world’s  fastest-growing  economies, 
South  Korea  and  China,  moved  decisively  to 
embrace  high-technology,  low-carbon  growth  in 
their  stimulus  packages  in  2008  and  2009,  and 
in  China’s  outline  for  its  Twelfth  Five-Year  Plan. 
Of the seven “magic growth sectors” identiﬁed in 
the  Twelfth  Five-Year  Plan,  three  are  low-carbon 
industries:  clean  energy,  energy  efﬁciency,  and 
clean-energy vehicles (the other two sectors are in 
high-end manufacturing).

 (cid:96) Finally, the potential gains from investment in 
energy  eﬃciency  and  renewables  may  not  yet 
have been recognized. 

ineﬃciencies, 

As fossil fuels and other scarce resources continue 
to  rise  in  price,  and  as  the  policy  environment 
addresses 
this  should  change. 
However,  even  where  clear  gains  have  existed 
in  the  past,  there  have  been  several  additional 
barriers preventing optimal investment in resource 
eﬃciency: 

 (cid:96) There  are  often  split  incentives  where  the 
beneﬁts of energy savings do not accrue to the 
individual or group making the investment (the 
landlord, construction ﬁrm, or property seller, 
for example). 

 (cid:96) Eﬃciency  gains  that  boost  productivity  in 
the  long  run  often  threaten  individual  jobs, 
triggering political resistance. 

 (cid:96) Research in renewable energy is often long-term 
and  speculative,  carrying  many  risks,  with 
knowledge spillovers that are hard to monetize 
or patent. Consequently, innovation has often 
fallen short of the social optimum. 

 (cid:96) Finally,  a  lack  of  expertise  often  hinders  the 
speed of the change in the urban environment. 

Despite these barriers, cities increasingly lead the 
ﬁeld  in  changing  the  public  perception  in  favor 
of sustainable policies, often inﬂuencing even the 
national  agenda.  Examples  include  congestion 
charging  in  London,  car  sharing  in  Berlin,  and 
planning  and  policy  leadership  in  Bandung, 
Barcelona,  Brisbane,  Guelph,  Nanjing,  and 
Portland, many of which set the standard within 
their  countries.  As  discussed  in  the  previous 
chapter, central and local government agencies are 
often best positioned to prompt behavioral change 
by engaging a well-informed population. 

 (cid:96) Weak  monitoring  and  measurement  systems 
make it hard to manage and monetize the gains 
from  eﬃciency  investments—for  example,  few 
consumers  have  smart  meters  to  alert  them 
to  energy  use  and  waste—which  reduces  the 
incentive to invest. 

Thus, public intervention with a popular and clearly 
understood  mandate  is  essential  for  addressing 
the market failures associated with urban sustain-
ability (Rode et al. 2012). Credible policy signals 
at the city level can leverage private investment in 
renewable  energy,  smart  networks  and  commu-

nities,  energy  eﬃciency,  and  low-carbon  vehicles 
while  stimulating  the  local  economy.  One  good 
opportunity is targeted public procurement, which 
aﬀords cities a chance to shape markets and incen-
tivize  innovation  on  low-carbon  products  and 
services (Stern 2010).

With  output  remaining  below  capacity  and  the 
cost  of  capital  at  historically  low  levels,  there  is 
less  fear  of  crowding  out  alternative  investment 
or  displacing  jobs.  While  the  private  sector  may 
remain cautious, some 82 percent of cities report 
that climate change represents an economic oppor-
tunity for their city; the most commonly reported 
opportunity is green jobs (reported by 40 cities), 
closely  followed  by  development  of  new  business 
and industries (reported by 39 cities) (CDP 2012).

Recession Investing  
and Sustainable Finance

Among  the  other  co-beneﬁts  of  sustainable  cities, 
planning  policy  can  also  inﬂuence  the  macroeco-
nomic environment. During economic downturns, 
urban infrastructure and retroﬁtting can boost job 
creation and stimulate activity, especially in “shovel-
ready” sectors such as building eﬃciency retroﬁts, 
broadband  infrastructure,  and  retooling  manufac-

turers.  In  the  present  environment,  there  is  an 
opportunity to take advantage of the record pool of 
private savings, provided the investment packages 
have adequate returns for private investment funds 
(Zenghelis  2011b).  Public  funds  could  be  used  to 
leverage,  guarantee,  or  otherwise  improve  the 
attractiveness  of  clean  and  green  investments  to 
the private sector. But this will require creativity in 
planning and designing new ﬁnancial instruments 
to encourage sustainable urbanization. 

Indeed,  now  may  be  an  ideal  time  to  invest  in  a 
sound  long-term  growth  strategy  and  to  address 
the  basic  market  failures  hindering  green  urban 
investment. It is a myth that recessions are a bad 
time to plan green investments because they add 
to business costs. 

For a city to be sustainable in the long run it must 
diversify its capital base and generate cash ﬂow for 
reinvestment. Although multiple sources of capital 
are available to city governments and businesses—
including  public,  private  and  developmental 
capital—urban sustainability initiatives often fail to 
secure the investment they require. To access new 
sources of ﬁnance, cities need to create conducive 
policy  and  investment  environments  and  artic-
ulate the value of their sustainability initiatives in

terms that interest each investor. For example, the 
private sector will care about revenue growth and 
productivity, the public sector about cost-to-serve 
and sustainability targets, and citizens about bill 
savings and well-being (Figure 5). 

Social Impact Bonds6 in the UK are an example of 
how to foster a common perception of value. The 
UK government created an outcome-driven system 
for solving societal issues that aligns public sector 
funding with private sector incentives so that there 
is a mutual beneﬁt from the improved outcomes. 

The Need for Knowledge

To  take  full  advantage  of  the  economic  beneﬁts 
of  green  policies,  cities  will  ultimately  need  a 
better-developed  research  base.  As  we  have  seen, 
there  is  mounting  evidence  that  measures  that 
make cities work better in terms of emissions and 
sustainability  also  make  them  more  prosperous 
and attractive. These data need to be collated in 
order  to  develop  a  fuller  understanding  of  the 
policy mixes that can lead to successful, resource-
eﬃcient cities. However, problems of data compat-

ibility and reliability, and ultimately the fact that 
no two cities are alike, make the analytical task a 
challenge. These issues are discussed in Chapter 5. 

First,  though,  we  will  explore  the  types  of  inter-
ventions that need to be studied—the best oppor-
tunities  for  making  cities  cleaner,  more  eﬃcient, 
and more prepared for climate change and other 
shocks.  There  is  no  one-size-ﬁts-all  solution  for 
complex  and  heterogeneous  cities,  but  all  have 
scope  to  increase  eﬃciency,  make  greater  use  of 
renewable resources, and improve the environment 
for  innovation,  with  signiﬁcant  economic  as  well 
as  environmental  returns.  The  investments  and 
strategic  decisions  made  over  the  next  few  years 
will determine where the winners and losers will 
be in rising to the challenge of a sustainable future.

28 BUILDING SUSTAINABILITY IN AN URBANIZING WORLD

Building Clean and Efﬁcient Cities

Key Messages
 (cid:96) Land and housing regulations as well as market-based incentives can be used to encourage 

compact, efﬁcient cities. 

 (cid:96) Rapid urbanization, particularly in Africa, the most rapidly urbanizing continent, presents the 

risk of uncontrolled sprawl as well as the opportunity to transition directly to more sustainable 
infrastructure.  

 (cid:96) Cities are the primary global energy consumers. Both developed and developing country cities 
need to enact policies that increase energy efﬁciency and promote cleaner energy sources for 
electricity generation, buildings, and urban transport.

 (cid:96) Buildings constitute the largest opportunity to improve demand-side energy efﬁciency. Green 

building standards target the operational phase of building life, while embodied energy in 
buildings can be conserved through the adaptive reuse of historic built assets.

 (cid:96) Emissions from transport are likely to increase dramatically as demand for private transpor-
tation grows in the developing world. Transport sector investments need to provide a viable 
alternative to automobile use. 

 (cid:96) Waste generation is increasing in quantity and complexity with urban growth. Municipal solid 

waste generation is unlikely to peak before 2100, and this will exacerbate shortfalls in municipal 
budgets to collect and properly dispose of waste.

Cities can take advantage of their massive growth 
in the coming decades to become more livable and 
sustainable,  but  they  will  need  to  move  quickly 
and  target  the  sectors  and  policies  that  have  the 
greatest  inﬂuence  on  resource-eﬃciency,  green-
house  gas  emissions,  and  other  pollution.  Rapid 
growth will necessitate a supply of serviced land 
and aﬀordable housing, embedded in a city form 
that serves the economic needs of the community. 
It will be necessary as well to invest in connective 
infrastructure  and  basic  services  that  have  the 
lowest possible resource intensity. 

An  essential  starting  point  for  growing  cities  is 
the  urban  form,  shaped  by  land  and  housing 
policies.  As  discussed  in  Chapter  2,  urban 

density  or  sprawl  broadly  aﬀect  eﬃciency  and 
economic productivity. In addition, three urban 
sectors—energy,  buildings  and  transportation—
are responsible for the bulk of global greenhouse 
gas  emissions  and  deserve  priority  in  analytical 
inquiries  and  policy  actions.  Urban  electricity, 
heat, and cooling together contribute 37 percent 
of  global  energy-related  emissions,  buildings 
contribute 25 percent, and urban transportation 
contributes  22  percent  (WRI  2009).  Water  and 
solid  waste  management  are  also  central  to 
sustainable  cities.  Box  14  reviews  how  the  key 
areas could be addressed in an emerging economy 
like  China,  and  Figure  6  shows  the  top  actions 
taken by cities in the C40 network.

Chinese  cities  have  among  the  highest  levels  of  per 
capita greenhouse emissions in the world. As millions 
of  people  migrate  to  cities  over  the  next  20  years, 
China  will  need  a  strategy  to  curb  carbon  emissions 
in urban areas. The following elements are essential 
building blocks of such a strategy:

(cid:3)(cid:96) Increasing  energy  efﬁciency  and  use  of  clean 
energy  sources:  Cities  should  make  an  effort  to 
reduce carbon emissions by sustaining demand-side 
energy efﬁciency measures, particularly in industry, 
power, heating and buildings. In addition, cities could 
develop clean sources of energy supply with rooftop 
solar PV and solar water heating installations. 

(cid:3)(cid:96) Reducing  transport  sector  emissions:  To  minimize 
emissions  from  the  transportation  sector,  reduced 
motorization will be required. Decisive action should 
be taken both to adopt new technologies and provide 
high-quality public and non-motorized transport. 

(cid:3)(cid:96) Managing  cities’  physical  growth:  Cities  need  to 
intervene in the shape and direction of their physical 
growth. Cities with higher densities emit less green-
house  gases.  Cities  not  only  need  to  grow  denser 
but  also  smarter,  fostering  compact  communities, 
multiple-use buildings, and public transport networks.

(cid:3)(cid:96) Support  of  low-carbon  lifestyles:  With  rising 
income  and  higher  individual  purchasing  power 
and consumption demands, a low-carbon lifestyle 
will be a key determinant of future energy demand 
in  Chinese  cities.  Some  tools  have  been  devel-
oped  internationally  to  engage  citizens  in  under-
standing  their  household  carbon  emissions  and 
taking action to reduce them. Similar partnerships 
at the city and neighborhood level in China could 
contribute to less carbon-intensive households. 

(cid:3)(cid:96) Replacing  energy-intensive  manufacturing  with 
low energy intensity economic activities: Changes 
in the urban economic base, such as a transition to 
service industries, will reduce emissions. However, 
such  strategies  need  to  be  considered  carefully. 
For  today’s  industrial  centers,  simply  relocating 
higher emission industries outside a city boundary 
to  reduce  the  greenhouse  gas  emissions  of  that 
city  would  make  little  (if  any)  difference  on  the 
national scale. However, rapidly growing small and 
medium-sized cities may have the opportunity to 
leap-frog  and  bypass  the  polluting,  high-carbon 
growth  paths  taken  by  the  earlier  generation  of 
Chinese cities.

30 BUILDING SUSTAINABILITY IN AN URBANIZING WORLD

Land Management and Policy
The supply of aﬀordable, serviced land is probably 
the  most  important  input  for  sustainable  urban-
ization.  The  World  Development  Report  2009 
(World Bank 2009) explicitly mentioned the impor-
tance of good land markets to enable the eﬀective 
expansion  of  urban  agglomerations  and  the 
mobility of production factors. For countries in the 
earlier  stages  of  urbanization,  land  management 
is particularly important as records and titles are 
often  missing,  legal  systems  are  fragmented  and 
inconsistent,  and  private  interests  may  lead  to 
speculation  and  corruption  as  urban  expansion 
increases demand for usable land. Tenure reform 
or  systematizing  land  titles  can  bring  major 
beneﬁts in such cases (Box 15). 

To  ensure  the  design  of  a  good  local  development 
plan,  cities  need  knowledge,  a  commitment  to 
sustainability, and an understanding of how density, 
infrastructure,  and  the  use  of  transport  alterna-

tives  contribute  to  emissions  and  sustainability.  To 
implement such a plan, local authorities need to have 
good land records, titles, policies, and the authority 
to allocate land and establish the rules as manifested 
in zoning laws, adequate ﬂoor area ratios and height 
limits, and building codes. Thus, the key pillars of 
urban planning include good land records and titling, 
a  good  understanding  of  how  the  city  is  growing, 
the preferences of the residents and businesses, and 
knowledge of how zoning and transport systems can 
work together to enable the implementation of the 
plan (Box 16). Cities would be best advised to under-
stand  how  to  deploy  market  incentives  to  promote 
growth in the desired direction (Box 17). 

Typical  regulations  that  aﬀect  land  availability 
include  zoning,  minimum  lot  size,  ﬂoor  area 
ratios,  and  height  limits.  Often,  land  or  housing 
regulations  become  constraints  to  a  quick  and 
responsive  supply  of  urban  land.  Minimum  lot 
sizes,  minimum  frontage,  and  the  percentage

Africa used to be the continent where 
land systems were complex and where 
standardized title systems were usually 
absent. In the last few years, however, 
progress has been remarkable. Several 
African  countries  have  made  impres-
sive progress in recognizing traditional 
and modern titles and in improving land 
records and transaction deeds. This not 
only  offers  a  solid  basis  for  property 
taxation, but provides the public sector 
with  the  fundamental  tools  for  land-
use  planning  and  urban  infrastructure 
development.

Connecting Transportation  
and Land-Use Planning

Successful  cities  such  as  Seoul  and  Curitiba  have 
promoted  urban  development  around  public  trans-
portation  and  amenities  (Curitiba),  or  around  urban 
core  areas  (Seoul),  relying  on  transportation  linkages, 
mixed land uses, and high-quality urban services. Land-
use  zoning  policies  that  allow  for  higher  densities  and 
greater  mixing  of  residential  and  commercial  uses 
enhance transportation goals by reducing trip distances, 
while strategic mass transit linkages can attract devel-
opment and promote compact growth. However, density 
can  also  be  perceived  as  a  cost—crime  and  violence 
tend  to  be  higher  in  dense  places,  and  local  trafﬁc  is 
worse. These costs must be outweighed by the beneﬁts 
of  agglomeration  and  urban  amenities,  including  prox-
imity to high-quality public transportation (Cheshire and 
Magrini  2009).  Long-term  growth  plans  aim  to  strike 
this balance in a number of OECD metropolitan areas, 
including London, New York, and Paris.

of  plots  allocated  to  public  infrastructure  eﬀec-
tively limit the supply of serviced land. In highly 
urbanized  countries, 
land  policies  continue 
to  shape  environmental,  social,  and  economic 
outcomes.  Misguided  regulations  or 
inelastic 
land  supply  often  lead  to  unaﬀordable  land  and 
housing  prices  in  the  center  of  the  city,  pushing 
out the working class and low-income households. 
Lack of suﬃcient transportation compromises the 
livelihoods of new urban residents. 

While zoning and other regulations are necessary 
to  preserve  the  planned  use  of  land,  the  usual 
result is to push residents to the urban periphery, 
which eventually leads to sprawl. Recognizing this, 
many  cities  have  started  working  to  reverse  the 
constraints that bring about sprawl and decentral-
ization.  In  this  vein,  it  is  also  crucial  that  urban 
planning take account of informality. Due to a lack 
of information, commitment, or knowledge, many 
developing cities plan the “oﬃcial city” and neglect 

Market-Based Incentives for Land Policy

Market-based incentives and regulatory frameworks are 
the  key  ingredients  of  good  land  policy.  In  the  case  of 
development  density,  market-based  incentives  should 
begin  by  dismantling  old  regulations  that  promoted 
sprawl. For example, in the U.S. state of South Carolina, 
nonessential regulatory requirements on housinga were 
eliminated  in  order  to  encourage  affordable  housing, 
traditional  neighborhood  design,  and  density.  These 
market-based 
included  density  bonuses 
to  promote  densities  higher  than  typically  permitted; 
relaxed  zoning  regulations  regarding  lot  area  require-
ments, minimum setbacks, yard requirements, variances, 
parking  requirements,  and  street  layout;  reduced  or 
waived fees, including fees levied on new development; 
streamlining and expediting the permitting process; and 
traditional neighborhood design to promote high density 
and mixed-use development. 

incentives 

Transferable  development  rights  (TDR)  programs 
operate  through  the  transfer  of  development  rights 
from one geographic area to another within a region. 
For example, a local government may adopt a zoning 
ordinance that assigns a density of 1 dwelling unit per 
20 acres (1:20 zoning) to a rural area, and a density of 1 
dwelling unit per acre (1:1 zoning) to urban areas. If the 
local government wished to shift future growth from 
rural  areas  to  urban  areas,  it  could  “downzone,”  or 
decrease the density, in the rural areas—for example, 

from  1:20  zoning  to  1:50  zoning—and  “upzone,”  or 
increase the density, in the urban areas (for example, 
from 1:1 zoning to 2:1 zoning). 

Under a TDR framework, the private market drives the 
shift in density, once the local government adopts an 
ordinance  allowing  urban  developers  to  “purchase” 
development  rights  from  rural  landowners.  Techni-
cally,  the  urban  developer  is  paying  the  rural  land-
owner  to  place  a  permanent  conservation  easement 
on his or her property, in exchange for the ability to 
develop  at  higher  densities  in  the  urban  area.  The 
amount  paid  is  governed  by  the  free  market,  but 
generally  should  reﬂect  the  difference  between  the 
value  of  the  rural  property  with  development  rights 
and without them. In this way, the urban developer can 
secure greater densities in urban markets, while the 
rural landowner can continue to use his or her prop-
erty for traditional rural uses and receive payment for 
development  rights  without  actually  developing  the 
property.  The  TDR  program  in  Montgomery  County, 
Maryland, viewed as one of the most successful in the 
United States, has preserved nearly 50,000 acres of 
land through a market-based TDR program.

the spontaneous growth that happens outside the 
administrative boundary. This leads to an actual 
growth  of  the  metropolitan  area  that  is  outside 
the  control  or  the  supervision  of  speciﬁc  urban 
authorities. Only later, when the pressure for infra-
structure services arises, is the city administration 
forced  to  deal  with  the  massive  growth  that  has 
happened outside its jurisdiction. In many cases, 
this  growth  involves  low-income  residents  who 
have little capacity to pay for infrastructure, which 
leads to the spread of slums. 

Rapid Urbanization in Africa:  
Sprawl or Leapfrog?

The  dangers  and  opportunities  of  rapid  urban-
ization are nowhere more apparent than in Africa, 
the  fastest-urbanizing  continent.  African  cities 
have been expanding with little coordination, and 
their situation illustrates the need to manage the 
urban  form  through  land  policy,  transportation 
planning, and service provision.  

Although  only  40  percent  of  Africans  currently 
live  in  urban  areas,  over  the  next  two  decades 
Africa’s urban population is projected to increase 
at an average annual rate of 3.1 percent, compared 
to  the  world’s  average  annual  growth  rate  of  1.7 
percent.  The  driving  forces  include  “push”  and 
“pull”  factors  of  rural-urban  migration,  natural 
increase,  and  reclassiﬁcation  of  formerly  rural 
areas as urban (Kessides 2006; UN-Habitat 2008). 

By  2030,  nearly  350  million  new  urban  dwellers 
will reside in African cities, as indicated in Figure 
7.  This  will  result  in  unprecedented  needs  for 
infrastructure and investment. At the same time, 
African  cities  account  for  over  50  percent  of  the 
continent’s  total  GDP,  and  the  rapid  growth  of 
cities could allow countries to harness the beneﬁts 
of  urbanization,  fueling  economic  growth  and 
sustainable development. 

African  countries  are  at  various  levels  of  urban-
ization, and the urban transition will continue to 

34 BUILDING SUSTAINABILITY IN AN URBANIZING WORLD

proceed  diﬀerently.  There  will  be  much  slower 
urbanization  in  coming  years  in  countries  like 
South  Africa  (which  is  already  more  than  60 
percent urbanized) than in East African countries 
like  Tanzania  and  Kenya  (less  than  30  percent 
urban, with average annual urban growth greater 
than 4 percent between 2000 and 2030). 

Urbanization  inevitably  results  in  transforma-
tions of urban form. Projections indicate that the 
built-up area of cities in developing countries will 
triple  between  2000  and  2030,  while  doubling 
their populations within the same period. As cities’ 
built-up areas grow their density usually declines, 
as can be observed in Addis Ababa and Nairobi, 
which are both among Africa’s 15 most populous 
cities. During the last decade, Nairobi and Addis 
Ababa  experienced  average  annual  density 
declines of about 4 and 2.2 percent, respectively, 
while their built-up areas increased by 7.1 and 6.3 
percent per annum, respectively. Johannesburg, in 
contrast, displayed a diﬀerent pattern; its built-up 
area  increased  by  only  2.1  percent  and  urban 
density  rose  by  1.4  percent  per  annum  between 
2000 and 2009. 

If similar density changes are experienced in the 
next 20 years, the cities’ forms would be drastically 
altered, as shown in Figure 8. Although sustained 
increases  in  sprawl  over  a  two-decade  period  are 
unlikely  in  the  face  of  other  regulating  factors, 
even an annual density decline of 1 percent would 
increase  African  urban  cover  from  1.5  percent 
of total arable land in 2000 to about 5.6 percent 
by  2030.  This  has  implications  for  food  security 
and water management issues, both of which are 
already a concern for the continent.

Provision of urban infrastructure and services has 
not kept pace with urbanization in most African 

cities.  As  their  populations  increase  and  people 
become  more  aﬄuent,  the  cities  are  faced  with 
daunting  challenges  in  managing  transportation, 
water  and  wastewater,  solid  waste,  and  energy, 
with demand far outstripping supply. In addition, 
uncoordinated  growth  of  cities  over  the  past  few 
years has dispersed their populations, with more 
people living in the urban peripheries and thereby 
increasing  the  cost  of  infrastructure  and  service 
provision. Equal access to infrastructure and basic 
services is an issue requiring urgent intervention 
in African cities. 

On  the  other  hand,  African  cities  have  a  unique 
opportunity  to  harness  the  beneﬁts  of  urban-
ization. As discussed in Chapter 1, in cities where 
rapid  growth  is  occurring  and  many  investment 
decisions  on  infrastructure  and  land-use  devel-
opment  are  currently  taking  place,  making  the 
right  decisions  will  inﬂuence  the  form  that  the 
cities  adopt.  Going  forward,  urban  planning 
should promote settlement patterns that capitalize 
on  agglomeration  economies  derived  from  lower 
per-head  costs  of  infrastructure  networks,  high 
reliance  on  public  and  non-motorized  transport, 
and more eﬃciently planned cities (Glaeser 2011 
and Kenworthy 2006). At present, public transport 
represents  only  a  small  fraction  of  the  amount 
invested  in  road  infrastructure  and  maintenance 
in most African cities (UITP 2010). By promoting 
low-carbon  public  transport,  African  cities  could 
“leapfrog”  past  unsustainable  transport  devel-
opment stages experienced by other cities.

The time is now for African cities to act if they are to 
move toward sustainable urban development. This 
should be viewed as a win-win situation, where the 
cities  achieve  their  development  agendas  while 
reaping environmental and social co-beneﬁts.

36 BUILDING SUSTAINABILITY IN AN URBANIZING WORLD

Energy 

Cities  are  the  major  global  energy  users  (IEA 
2008)  and  the  major  actors  to  improve  society’s 
energy eﬃciency while simultaneously decreasing 
the  associated  carbon  emissions.  Many  cities, 
especially  in  the  OECD,  have  already  taken 
action  in  this  area  with  policies  that  increase 
energy  eﬃciency  and  promote  cleaner  energy 
sources.  Worldwide,  of  the  73  cities  that  partici-
pated in voluntary reporting through the Carbon 
Disclosure Project in 2012, almost half (48 percent) 
have a renewable energy target (CDP 2012). 

Local  strategies  can  focus  on  improving  energy 
conservation,  increasing  the  use  of  renewable 
energy,  improving  the  eﬃciency  of  fossil-based 
power-generation  facilities,  transitioning  to  less 
carbon-intensive  fuels  (for  example,  from  coal  to 
natural  gas),  and  employing  carbon  capture  and 
storage  technology.  The  use  of  these  strategies 
depends  on  the  institutional  capacity  of  the  city, 
the  local  resource  base  and  the  “willingness  of 
the constituents to bear the price impacts of these 
policies” (OECD 2011b). 

The  OECD  report  Towards  Green  Growth  (OECD 
2011b)  describes  some  of  the  systems  cities  are 
developing  to  produce  renewable  power  locally. 
Some  cities  have  invested  heavily  in  clean  heat 
production,  in  wind  turbines  that  are  typically 
placed outside city boundaries, and in photovoltaic 
systems located on buildings or in dedicated open 
areas. Among the innovators: 

 (cid:96) Cities such as Toronto and Amsterdam use lake-

water air conditioning and seawater heating. 

 (cid:96) Copenhagen’s  district  heating  system,  which 
captures waste heat from power generation that 
is normally released into the sea as hot water, 
has  helped  reduce  emissions  and  has  taken 
$1,907  oﬀ  the  average  household  bill  each 
year.  Copenhagen  also  produces  energy  from 

much of its waste, sending a mere 3 percent to 
landﬁlls (C40 2010a). 

 (cid:96) In  Freiburg,  Germany,  photovoltaic  panels 
cover  13,000  square  meters  (139,931  square 
feet)  of  the  city’s  building  surfaces,  including 
the main railway station. 

 (cid:96) San  Francisco  operates  the  largest  city-owned 
solar  power  system  in  the  United  States  (C40 
2010b). 

 (cid:96) The  London  Array  oﬀshore  wind-turbine 
system is due to produce 1,000 megawatts, or 
enough to power 750,000 homes. 

 (cid:96) In  2009,  Venice  opened  the  ﬁrst  16-megawatt 
hydrogen-fuelled power station, serving 20,000 
households. 

Cities  that  are  not  energy  producers,  on  the 
other  hand,  can  adopt  regulations  that  promote 
connection with renewable energy sources and the 
supply of clean energy to the city grid. Cities are 
also  testing  alternative  models  to  the  traditional 
central  station  grid  model.  There  are  experi-
ments with on-site photovoltaics and wind power, 
and  with  “smart  grid”  technologies  that  monitor 
the  electricity  consumed  by  each  household  and 
provide  data  to  inform  energy  management  (see 
the “Smart Cities” section below). A combination 
of  energy  management  systems,  small-scale 
distributed energy sources such as solar panels on 
buildings  or  mini-wind  turbines  in  the  city,  and 
energy  storage  resources  could  help  to  integrate 
all  energy  consumption  sectors  (Figure  9)  and 
optimize the city’s energy eﬃciency. Ideally, cities 
will be able to develop partial energy self-reliance 
by  means  of  distributed  modes  of  energy  gener-
ation,  using  wind  turbines,  geothermal  energy, 
solar power, biomass, and other resources. 

Until  renewables  become  more  commercially 
competitive,  however,  saving  energy  through

eﬃciency measures remains the most cost-eﬀective 
short-term  strategy.  While  the  renewable  energy 
industry has reached a considerable size in developed 
countries—in  2003,  there  were  approximately  1 
million  renewable  energy  jobs  worldwide—and 
costs  have  dropped  substantially,  most  renewable 
energy  sources  are  yet  not  price-competitive  with 
conventional  sources  (UNEP  and  New  Energy 
Finance 2010). In addition, distributed generation 
is more expensive than centralized generation, and 
residential solar photovoltaics are more expensive 
than  commercial  solar  photovoltaics  (Figure  10). 
Empirical evidence from California suggests that at 
$0.027–$0.034  per  kilowatt-hour,  the  average  cost 
of energy eﬃciency is signiﬁcantly lower than the 
cost of renewable energy (OECD 2011b). 

Nevertheless, investments in renewable energy are 
needed  today  to  reap  beneﬁts  over  the  medium 
to  long  term,  and  cities  have  a  role  to  play  here 
as  well.  Feed-in  tariﬀs  can  be  particularly  useful 
to promote supply. With this system, producers of 

renewable  energy  contribute  solar  electricity  into 
the  public  grid  and  receive  a  premium  tariﬀ  per 
generated kilowatt-hour, which reﬂects the beneﬁts 
of  renewable  electricity  compared  to  electricity 
generated  from  fossil  fuels.  Feed-in  tariﬀs  have 
helped attract investment for renewable energy in 
Europe and in a number of United States cities such 
as  Gainesville,  Florida  and  Los  Angeles  (OECD 
2011b). Other strategies that can be highly attractive 
for  renewable  energy  project  developers  include 
direct  purchasing  of  renewable  electricity  and 
renewable  equipment,  soft  loans,  and  guarantees 
provided by city or regional governments. 

Smart Cities 

The  phrase  “smart  city”  has  been  applied  to 
everything  from  distributed  power  generation  to 
high-tech  traﬃc  management,  but  it  is  particu-
larly  associated  with  programs  that  help  cities 
improve 
infor-
mation and communications technology (ICT) and 

their  resource-eﬃciency  using 

PART II: THE PATH TO SUSTAINABILITY 39

technological  infrastructure.  A  broadband  digital 
infrastructure  can  connect  people  to  each  other, 
people  to  city  systems,  and  city  systems  to  other 
city systems. Smart grids and similar technologies 
track  and  respond  to  data  from  energy,  transpor-
tation, and ICT infrastructures, allowing integrated 
management of these sectors.  Studies have shown 
that for a city of 50,000 inhabitants, within 10 years 
smart  city  infrastructure  could  bring  signiﬁcant 
savings,  and  consumption  of  fuel  and  heat  would 
decline by half, as would carbon dioxide emissions. 
Electricity consumption would fall by 31 percent.7 

One  of  the  speciﬁc  goals  of  smart  grid  ICT 
platforms  is  real-time  monitoring,  control,  and 
optimization  of  distributed  energy  resources. 
Increasingly,  smart  grids  and  their  household 
counterparts, smart meters and smart homes (Box 
18),  will  allow  energy  systems  to  be  managed  in 
real  time  while  providing  more  information  to 
end-users,  thus  changing  behavior  and  reducing 
energy demand. Not only households but operators 
of  large  buildings,  train  stations,  power  plants, 
and  other  infrastructure  will  be  able  to  directly 
manage  their  energy  consumption  and  carbon 
emissions.  Eco-districts  or  clusters  of  buildings 
with  a  networked 
infrastructure  coordinated 

7http://suslab.eu/partners/innovationcity-ruhr/

through  ICT  platforms  can  be  used  to  further 
increase energy eﬃciency. 

When businesses and residents produce part of their 
own  electricity  with  small-scale  solar  panels  and 
small wind turbines, smart technologies allow them 
to  feed  their  excess  production  back  into  the  grid, 
helping the city to reach partial energy self-reliance. 
These  “energy-positive”  buildings  provide  not 
only  distributed  energy  resources  but  also  ﬂexible 
demand and storage points (for example, electric cars 
and stand-alone batteries). Storage technologies can 
be integrated to ensure continuous energy supply at 
the  city  scale,  and  the  smart  grid  can  be  designed 
to  optimize  energy  balances  based  on  real-time 
load  forecasts,  weather-based  generation  forecasts 
and energy price forecasts. These technologies can 
typically be used within the perimeter of the city, as 
well as by regional authorities and regulatory bodies 
wishing to audit and reduce carbon emissions.

Integrated technologies will help dense cities work 
eﬃciently  (Zenghelis  2011a).  Smart,  connected 
cities  will  monitor  and  measure  resource  ﬂows, 
predict  future  behavior  and  simulate  changes  in 
demand as a result of policy actions—all of which 
will  feed 
investment  decisions 
(Hoornweg et al. 2007). The applications go well 
beyond the energy grid. Smart transport systems

in  Singapore,  for  example,  are  used  to  tackle 
congestion, establish road user charges, and supply 
real-time information on traﬃc problems.8 

The spread of social media (discussed further in 
Chapter 6) could add another dimension to smart 
cities, providing new mechanisms for society-wide 
planning  and  collective  action.  For  instance,  as 
citizens  and  cities  become  more  interconnected, 
governments  can  begin  to  replace  blunt  regula-
tions  with  highly  personalized  incentives  and 
instructions. These could be tailored in real-time 
to  coordinate  the  actions  of  individuals  toward 
goals  like  peak  load  management  in  the  energy

sector. Experiments by Cisco in Amsterdam, IBM 
in Dubuque, Iowa (see Box 19), and others have 
shown that simply making citizens aware of their 
individual energy eﬃciency relative to that of their 
neighbors can encourage a virtuous race to the top. 

The signs are encouraging: smart city initiatives are 
underway in many urban centers. Cities are already 
beginning  to  link  solutions  to  policy  goals  and 
initiatives, assessing the value of both household-
level smart meters and city-level smart grids. For 
example,  San  Diego’s  beneﬁts  from  a  planned 
smart  grid  implementation  were  estimated  to  be 
$2.7 billion over 20 years, with an internal rate of 
return up to 75 percent and payback period of 3.5 
years. Table 3 shows ongoing technology-enabled 
initiatives in cities of the C40 network. 

In  Stratford,  Ontario,  the  smart  home  that  controls 
domestic  appliances  from  a  single  interface—in  this 
case, a tablet—is becoming a reality.

Stratford, a city of 32,000, has begun a series of pilot 
projects  that  leverage  its  municipal  Wi-Fi  network. 
One  of  the  most  recent  initiatives  is  a  joint  venture 
between the city, Toshiba’s international lighting divi-
sion,  smart  home  integration  company  anyCOMM, 
and Research In Motion (RIM), maker of the PlayBook 
tablet.  The  project  will  see  30  Stratford  homes  and 
businesses  ﬁtted  with  Wi-Fi  enabled  LED  light  bulb 
prototypes  from  Toshiba,  wirelessly  networked  and 
controlled  via  RIM’s  PlayBook  touchscreen  loaded 
with anyCOMM home-automation software.

The  technology  will  start  with  on/off  and  dimming 
commands  for  individual  bulbs  and  is  expected  to 
evolve features such as smart wall plugs, heating and 
cooling controls, and home security. Once the system 
is  proven,  the  larger  plan  is  to  deploy  the  LEDs  and 
tablets across the city’s 20,000 homes and businesses.

These in-home systems will be integrated with Strat-
ford’s citywide wireless smart meter system, allowing 
customers to control their energy costs, usage, timing, 
and  conservation.  They  will  be  able  to  access  their 

The  tablet  program  follows  investments  in  a  hybrid 
Internet  infrastructure  analogous  to  other  utility  and 
infrastructure networks such as electricity, water, natural 
gas, and transportation. When the Province of Ontario’s 
energy  board  mandated  electrical  utilities  to  switch  to 
smart meters that would provide consumers with their 
hourly  usage  data,  Stratford  opted  for  a  Wi-Fi  mesh 
canopy over Rhyzome’s 70-kilometer loop of optical ﬁber 
woven  through  the  city.  As  a  result  of  this  meter  data 
backhaul  system,  there  is  contiguous,  ubiquitous  high-
speed Internet access across the entire operating area.

An  integrated  system  also  offers  social  engagement 
and  two-way  communications  with  the  city,  giving 
households  access  to  online  services  and  city  infor-
mation—from  school  bus  cancellations  to  emergency 
preparedness  and  disaster  response.  Recognizing 
this  vision  for  economic  and  social  infrastructure, 
the New York-based think tank Intelligent Community 
Forum  designated  Stratford  as  one  of  the  top  seven 
“intelligent communities” worldwide in 2011 and 2012, 
ranking  it  among  cities  such  as  New  York,  Seoul, 
Stockholm, and Taipei. 

IBM’s Smart City Projects

IBM is a member of the Sustainable Cities Partnership 
and has been active in research and development of 
smart  city  technology,  partnering  with  cities  across 
three continents: 

Portland, Oregon: Understanding 
Connections between City Systems
Today  most  cities  are  managed  in  silos,  but  this 
approach does not mirror how cities function in reality. 
Through  a  partnership  with  the  City  of  Portland,  IBM 
has developed an approach to city planning that looks 
at a city all at once and over time. IBM System Dynamics 
for Smarter Cities is a systems-thinking tool that helps 
city leaders learn how their city functions as an inter-
connected “system of systems” by exploring interactive 
visual maps and simulating macro-level policy changes. 
By  enabling  them  to  visualize  how  city  systems  work 
together,  the  simulation  model  helps  city  leaders 
analyze policy decisions and their impact on citizens.  

The  simulation  model:  (a)  examines  the  relationships 
that  exist  among  a  city’s  core  systems,  such  as  the 
economy, housing, education, public safety, transporta-
tion, health care, government services, and utilities; (b) 
allows city planners to see how city systems interact with 
and affect each other in order to improve long-range city 
planning and help them become systems thinkers; and 
(c) enables municipal ofﬁcials to create countless “what 
if” scenarios. Portland is using the model to help create 
a new 25-year strategic plan for the city. 

Rio de Janeiro: Improving Emergency 
Response
 The City of Rio de Janeiro and IBM are collaborating on 
a city operations center designed to improve emergency 
response  coordination,  manage  increased  trafﬁc  ﬂows, 
and improve city services as the city prepares for hosting 
the  2014  World  Cup  and  the  2016  Olympics.  Following 
a  series  of  ﬂoods  and  mudslides  in  April  2010,  the  Rio 
Operations Center was initially designed to improve city 
safety and responsiveness to incidents. In 2011, IBM and 
the  local  government  extended  their  collaboration  with 
the  announcement  of  an  emergency  alert  system  that 
will  notify  city  ofﬁcials  and  emergency  personnel  when 
changes occur in the ﬂood and landslide forecast for the 
city. In contrast to a previous system in which notiﬁcations 
were manually relayed, the new alert system is expected 
to  drastically  reduce  the  reaction  times  to  emergency 
situations  by  using  instantaneous  mobile  communica-
tions, including automated email notiﬁcations and instant 
messaging, to reach emergency personnel and citizens. 

Currently,  the  city  operations  center  integrates  and 
interconnects information from more than 30 govern-
ment  departments  to  one  centralized  command 
center, helping local government ofﬁcials gather data 
across city operations to monitor and respond to prob-
lems more quickly, and to predict potential problems 
that might emerge in order to minimize impact. Over 
time,  the  goal  is  to  expand  this  center  to  also  cover 
transportation, public works, and utilities.

Dubuque, Iowa: Promoting Sustainability, 
Economic Growth and City Brand

In 2009, The City of Dubuque and IBM came together 
to  form  Smarter  Sustainable  Dubuque  (SSD),  a  public-
private  partnership  with  the  aim  of  leveraging  smart 
technologies  to  improve  sustainability  and  economic 
growth and development in Dubuque, Iowa. Together, IBM 
and the local government hope to make Dubuque one 
of the ﬁrst smarter sustainable cities in North America, 
and to develop new smart technologies and a sustain-
ability model that can be replicated globally in communi-
ties of 200,000 and smaller—where over 40 percent of 
the population of the United States resides. Reﬂected in 
the design of SSD is the local government’s belief that 
the key to long-term sustainability is to give consumers 
and businesses the information that they need to make 
informed decisions about how they consume resources 
like electricity, water, natural gas, and oil. 

The  ﬁrst  project,  the  Smarter  Water  Pilot,  enabled 
households  to  view  their  water  usage  on  an  hourly 
basis,  take  advantage  of  water  conservation  tips, 
compare their water usage performance against other 
households,  and  be  alerted  if  leaks  were  detected. 
After  the  3-month  pilot,  participants  decreased 
their  water  use  by  6.6  percent,  and  leak  detection 
and  response  was  increased  eight-fold.  Other  proj-
ects  under  SSD  include  Smarter  Electricity,  Smarter 
Natural Gas, and Smarter Travel Pilots. 

Stockholm: Improving Trafﬁc Flows  
and Decreasing Pollution 
Like many other cities in the world, Stockholm is battling 
the  problem  of  too  many  cars  on  too  few  roads—with 
over  half  a  million  cars  traveling  into  the  city  every 
weekday. By 2005, average commute times were up by 
18 percent from the year before. To combat this problem, 
the  Swedish  National  Road  Administration  and  the 
Stockholm City Council announced in early 2006 a trial 
congestion tax, similar to the road-charging systems in 
London, Oslo, and Singapore. The goal was not only to 
reduce congestion, but to also encourage ancillary bene-
ﬁts, such as improving public transport and alleviating 
environmental  damage.  The  government’s  plan  is  to 
devote revenue from the tax to the completion of a ring 
road around the city. The trial period ran from January 
to July 2006, and the tax was reinstated in 2007 by the 
then newly elected city government.

As a related follow-up project, IBM is collaborating with 
KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Sweden to provide 
Stockholm  residents  and  ofﬁcials  a  smarter  way  to 
manage  and  use  transportation.  Researchers  at  KTH 
Royal Institute of Technology are using IBM’s streaming 
analytics  technology  to  gather  real-time  information 
from the GPS devices on nearly 1,500 taxi cabs in the 
city. This will be expanded to gather data from delivery 
trucks, trafﬁc sensors, transit systems, pollution moni-
tors, and weather information. The data, processed by 
IBM’s InfoSphere Streams software, gives city ofﬁcials 
and  residents  real-time  information  on  trafﬁc  ﬂow, 
travel times, and the best commuting options.

dioxide  equivalent  in  2004  (Levine  et  al.  2007). 
Assuming that emissions will continue growing at 
a high 2.5 percent per year, that ﬁgure could reach 
15.6  billion  metric  tons  of  carbon  dioxide  equiv-
alent by 2030 (UNEP 2009a).

Historically, 
from 
buildings have been generated in North America, 
Europe, and Central Asia, but the total emissions 
from buildings in developing countries are expected 
to surpass these regions by 2030 (Figure 11). The 
long  lifetime  of  buildings  (50  to  100  years)  locks 
in  their  design  and  technical  characteristics  for 
decades.  But  in  this  growth  phase,  new  buildings 
also  provide  opportunities  to  reduce  energy 
consumption  through  the  careful  selection  of 
construction materials, building design, equipment, 
and appliances, and during building operation.

44 BUILDING SUSTAINABILITY IN AN URBANIZING WORLD

Indeed,  the  building  sector  has  greater  potential 
than  any  other  sector  for  signiﬁcantly  reducing 
greenhouse gas emissions (Figure 12). This means 
that  with  commercially  available  technologies, 
energy  consumption  in  both  new  and  existing 
buildings  can  be  cut  by  an  estimated  30  to  80 
percent  with  a  potential  net  proﬁt  during  the 
building  lifespan.9  The  potential  for  successful 
business in this sector cannot be underestimated.

Many countries and cities have tried to implement 
policies to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions of 
buildings, but there are several bottlenecks. First, 
the  building  sector  is  highly  fragmented,  from 
design through to the decommissioning phase. No 
single policy framework would be able to aﬀect all 
these phases. In addition, as discussed in Chapter 
2, the economic incentives for resource-eﬃciency 
are poorly designed—in particular, split incentives 

9Study and best practices in the United States show that just adjusting build-
ing operational practices can reduce energy use between 20 and 40 percent 
without requiring equipment upgrades or substantial retroﬁts. See: http://
esl.tamu.edu/ 

between building owners and tenants may prevent 
action—and  the  costs  and  beneﬁts  of  eﬃcient 
solutions are not widely known or benchmarked. 
Given the technical nature of green building, the 
engineering and design professions have an oppor-
tunity  to  make  available  standardized  technical 
notes that could be distributed among the builders 
and developers in cities around the world. 

Despite the challenges, the record of countries and 
cities  in  implementing  legislation  and  changing 
behavior  is  encouraging  (Table  4).  Some  typical 
initiatives include: 

Building  codes:  Most  developed  countries  have 
codes  for  new  buildings  that  are  performance-
based—for example, they set a maximum limit for 
the level of heat transfer through the building and 
require that all the equipment meet certain energy 
standards. The European Union has harmonized 
the standards for energy performance and certiﬁ-
cation in buildings. (European Commission 2008).

Mandatory building energy audits: In the United 
States,  savings  identiﬁed  after  energy  auditing 
can average 38 percent in cooking, 62 percent in 
heating, and 25 percent overall energy savings. 

Appliance standards are in place in some countries 
for energy-using products such as lighting, heating 
and cooking equipment, and personal computers. 
The  Top  Runner  program  in  Japan  resulted  in 
energy-eﬃciency  improvement  of  more  than  50 
percent  (Geller  et  al.  2006).  Standards  are  cost 
eﬀective because they reduce transaction costs for 
consumers and producers.

Encouraging off-grid applications of renewable 
energy technologies in buildings: For example, 
solar water heaters have been mandatory for new 
buildings  in  Spain  since  2005  and  Australia 
since  2006.  Baden-Wurttemberg 
in  Germany 
has  enacted  legislation  imposing  rules  on  new 
buildings  regarding  how  much  of  their  energy 
should  come  from  renewable  sources.  Germany, 
Ireland, Japan, Luxemburg, and South Africa all 
use  national  subsidies  to  encourage  public  struc-
tures to use renewable energy. 

Disseminating  renewable  energy  appliances: 
In  developing  countries,  particularly  those  with 
low  electriﬁcation  rates,  there  has  been  great 
progress.  A  major  Dutch  and  German  project 
initiated  in  2004  has  provided  5  million  people 
with access to improved cook stoves and electricity. 
Many  projects  ﬁnanced  by  the  World  Bank  and 
regional development banks have also had a clear 
impact on the use of renewable fuels. 

Zero-carbon  buildings  where  energy  provided 
by on-site renewable sources is equal to the energy 
used  by  the  building.  Zero-energy  buildings  are 
connected  to  the  main  electricity  grid  but  have 
zero net consumption because they produce more 
energy in the summer and consume more in the 
winter.  Interesting  projects  have  been  piloted, 
notably a Worldwide Federation for Nature (WFN) 

zero-energy  housing  project  in  the  Netherlands 
and  the  Malaysia  Energy  Center  (Pusar  Tenaga 
Malaysia)  headquarters  in  Kuala  Lumpur.  The 
town of Pedra Branca, Brazil, has 2,000 residents 
aiming  to  become  a  zero-carbon  community. 
In  Germany,  passive  building  technologies  are 
spreading  rapidly,  while  in  France,  the  Grenelle 
de l’Environment in France recommended that all 
new housing be passive or energy-positive by 2020 
(USGBC 2011). 

Rapid-deployment  neighborhoods:  From  2000  to 
2010, an estimated 6 million people per year were 
added to the world’s urban slum population, out of 
a total 58 million new urban dwellers per year in 
the developing world (UN-Habitat 2010b). Suitable 
housing must be provided rapidly to prevent slum 
formation.  This  can  be  accomplished  by  oﬀ-site, 
factory-based,  parallel  assembly  of  building 
subsystems (structural, ﬂoor, and façade). This is 
not  only  a  faster  and  more  eﬃcient  construction 
method,  it  also  reduces  construction  waste  and 
vehicle  travel  to  and  from  the  building  site,  as 
deliveries  are  made  only  when  components  are 
completed and fewer workers are required on site 
during  assembly.  Pilots  of  the  rapid-deployment 
neighborhood  system  have  been  carried  out  in 
Bangladesh, India, Nigeria, and Pakistan.

Public policies for green buildings generally include 
three options: revising zoning codes, incentivizing 
developers,  and  making  public  access  to  ﬁnance 
conditional  on  sustainability  criteria.  The  recent 
report Building the Green Economy from the Ground Up 
(USGBC and Green Building Council Brasil 2011) 
suggests  four  pillars  of  intervention:  fostering 
green communities and neighborhoods, achieving 
sustainable and aﬀordable housing, building green 
schools,  and  pursuing  resilience  as  part  of  the 
sustainable built environment. At the community 
or  neighborhood  level,  many  tools  exist  to  help 
assess and increase energy-eﬃciency—for example, 
the LEED for Neighborhood Design rating system 

from the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC), 
and ICLEI’s STAR Community Index.10

In  the  building  industry,  there  is  consensus  on 
the  attractive  market  potential  for  eﬃcient  new 
buildings and retroﬁtting old buildings (Boxes 20 
and 21), and a growing number of building owners 
are  combating  rising  energy  prices  by  pursuing 
energy eﬃciency. The Fifth Annual Global Energy 
Eﬃciency Survey (Johnson Controls, IFMA, and 
ULI    2011),  which  polled  4,000  building  owners 
around the world, shows that energy cost savings, 

10http://www.icleiusa.org/sustainability/star-community-index/

PART II: THE PATH TO SUSTAINABILITY 47

government 
incentives,  and  enhanced  public 
image  are  driving  energy  eﬃciency  in  buildings 
to new heights. The expected rise of energy costs 
is  especially  motivating,  as  80  percent  of  respon-
dents  expect  double-digit  energy  price  increases 
over 2012. 

The  survey  indicates  that  75  percent  of  building 
owners have set energy reduction goals—targeting 
12  percent  reductions,  on  average—and  nearly 
40  percent  have  achieved  at  least  one  green 
building  certiﬁcation,  which  is  twice  as  many  as 

the previous year. An additional 32 percent have 
incorporated  green  building  elements  such  as 
lighting, heating, ventilation, air conditioning, and 
controls improvements, which continue to be the 
most popular energy eﬃciency improvements; 77 
percent  of  the  North  American  building  owners 
plan  to  include  green  building  elements  in  their 
facility  plans  in  the  next  12  months.  Eﬃciency 
in  buildings  remains  the  top  global  strategy  for 
reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the United 
States, Europe, China, and India.

48 BUILDING SUSTAINABILITY IN AN URBANIZING WORLD

Embodied Energy  
and Historic Buildings11

Most of the current debate on energy in buildings 
focuses  on  “operational  energy,”  the  energy 
needed for building occupancy and use—heating, 
cooling,  and  lighting,  for  example.  But  buildings 
are  actually  associated  with  two  types  of  energy: 
embodied  and  operational.  Embodied  energy 
is  the  energy  consumed  by  all  of  the  processes 
related to the construction of a building, including 
the mining and processing of natural resources to 
manufacture building materials, transport, product 
delivery,  and  ﬁnal  assembly  at  the  construction

site (see Box 22). More reﬁned analyses consider 
the energy consumed in all stages of a building’s 
life cycle, including resource extraction, manufac-
turing of building elements, construction, use, and 
disposal  and  decommissioning.  Recent  studies 
demonstrate  that  embodied  energy  and  opera-
tional  energy  contribute  to  the  overall  energy 
balance of a building in almost equal shares and 
that, combined, they are responsible for about 50 
percent  of  global  carbon  dioxide  emissions.  An 
integrated approach tackling both types of energy 
use is urgently needed to reduce building-related 
emissions.

 

1Case Study: Reducing Operational 
Energy in the Empire State Building
2
X
O
B

In 2009, sustainability experts joined forces to retroﬁt 
the Empire State Building in New York using an inno-
vative  design  process  and  state-of-the-art  tools. 
The guiding goal was to use the most cost-effective 
measures to produce the most energy savings. After 
comprehensive  research,  it  was  found  that  rather 
than replacing the windows and purchasing new ones 
from  distant  factories,  it  was  more  energy  efﬁcient 
and  cost  effective  to  upgrade  the  6,514  dual-pane 
existing  windows  by  conserving  frames  and  glass 
and  upgrading  them  to  super-insulating  glass  units 
in  a  dedicated  processing  space  located  on-site.  As 
a  result,  96  percent  of  the  frames  and  glass  of  the 
Empire State Building were conserved and reused. 

The  project  was  completed  in  October  2010  as  one  of 
eight  measures  in  an  innovative  energy  retroﬁt  of  the 
building. The upgraded windows are expected to pay for 
themselves in three years. The project’s impacts include 
conserving embodied energy of existing windows (made 
of  aluminum  and  therefore  having  a  very  high  PER); 
reducing operational energy use by 38 percent; saving 
$4.4  million  per  year  in  operational  energy  costs;  and 
saving 105,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions 
over  the  next  15  years,  equivalent  to  the  annual  emis-
sions of 17,500 cars.

Measuring Embodied Energy

While  operational  energy  can  be  easily  determined 
by  measuring  what  is  needed  to  operate  a  building, 
embodied  energy  is  less  apparent  because  it  is 
embedded  in  the  various  steps  of  building  construc-
tion  and  material  production.  Various  tools  exist, 
however,  to  analyze  embodied  energy,  and  they  are 
becoming increasingly reﬁned.

Gross  energy  requirement  (GER)  is  a  measure  of 
the  true  embodied  energy  of  a  material,  which 
would ideally include all of the steps from mining to 
assembly.  Research  has  made  signiﬁcant  progress 
toward  assessing  GER,  and  a  number  of  tools  have 
been  widely  tested  to  measure  the  subset  of  GER 
known as the process energy requirement (PER).

P

Process  energy  requirement  (PER)  is  the  energy 
directly related to the manufacture of building mate-
rials. It includes the energy consumed in transporting 
the  raw  materials  to  the  factory  as  well  as  material 
production,  but  not  the  energy  consumed  in  trans-
porting  the  ﬁnal  product  to  the  building  site  and 
assembling  it,  which  are  the  remaining  components 
of GER unaccounted for by the PER. In general, PER 
accounts  for  50–80  percent  of  GER,  and  PER  tables 
are widely available for a variety of building materials. 
Both  GER  and  PER  are  measured  in  megajoules  of 
energy needed to make a kilogram of product. 

The  consensus  on  PER  data  for  a  wide  range  of 
materials  is  extremely  encouraging,  and  the  data 
can  already  be  used  by  stakeholders,  designers,  and 
developers  to  make  effective  decisions  in  urban 
development,  especially  to  advocate  conservation 
and  adaptive  reuse  of  existing  built  assets.  As  an 
example,  producing  1  kilogram  of  aluminum  requires 
170  megajoules,  whereas  producing  1  kilogram  of 
bricks  can  require  as  little  as  2  megajoules.  In  prac-
tice, this means that choosing materials with a lower 
PER  dramatically  reduces  the  embodied  energy  of  a 
building. It also means that by conserving and adap-
tively  reusing  existing  buildings,  the  total  PER  (that 
is, the cumulative PER of their constituent materials) 
does  not  have  to  be  discarded,  which  substantially 
reduces greenhouse gas emissions.

The  SBTool  standard,  the  U.K.  Code  for  Sustainable 
Homes, and the LEED Rating System from the USGBC 
already  take  embodied  energy,  along  with  other 
factors,  into  consideration  when  assessing  a  build-
ing’s environmental impact. These standards are very 
effective tools to promote both energy efﬁciency and 
the conservation of embodied energy in existing and 
historic  built  assets.  For  instance,  under  the  LEED 
system,  projects  can  earn  one  credit  for  reusing  75 
percent of the core and shell of an existing building. 

Life-cycle assessment (LCA) examines impacts during a 
building’s entire life, rather than focusing on one partic-
ular stage. Unlike traditional embodied energy calcula-
tions, LCA provides an assessment of direct and indirect 
environmental  impacts  associated  with  a  building  by 
quantifying  energy,  material  use,  and  environmental 
impacts at each stage of the life cycle, including resource 
extraction, goods manufacturing, construction, use, and 
disposal  and  decommissioning.  LCA  makes  an  even 
stronger  case  for  conserving  and  adaptively  reusing 
historic built assets and is the basis for the distribution 
of points under the updated LEED standards.

50 BUILDING SUSTAINABILITY IN AN URBANIZING WORLD

Embodied  energy  can  be  saved  in  two  ways:  by 
reducing the energy used to produce and assemble 
materials  in  new  buildings,  and  by  conserving 
and adaptively reusing existing buildings. In both 
cases, international practice has demonstrated that 
it is most important to focus on long-lived, durable 
buildings, which store the most energy over time. 
In fact, the best way to save embodied energy is to 
make buildings last longer. 

In the case of new buildings, a higher embodied 
energy can be justiﬁed only if it contributes to lower 
operational  energy.  For  example,  high  thermal 
mass  (associated  with  high  embodied  energy) 
can  signiﬁcantly  reduce  heating  and  cooling 
needs in well-designed and insulated passive solar 
houses. However, priority should go to conserving 
embodied  energy  in  existing  buildings,  consid-
ering  the  variety  of  options  to  adapt  older  struc-
tures  for  changing  needs  (Box  23).  Demolishing

An  innovative  project  currently  under  prepara-
tion,  ﬁnanced  by  the  World  Bank  ($50  million) 
and  China  ($70  million),  will  regenerate  the  two 
historic cities of Qufu and Zoucheng in Shandong 
Province. In light of the importance of embodied 
energy,  one  project  component  focuses  on  the 
conservation  and  adaptive  reuse  of  two  large 
historic  buildings  that  are  currently  underuti-
lized.  The  Confucius  and  Mencius  mansions  are 
vast  former  residences  that  today  are  mostly 
abandoned.  The  buildings  will  be  revitalized  to 
host  a  number  of  new  productive  functions, 
from  knowledge  centers  to  growth  poles  for 
sustainable  tourism.  The  physical  conservation 
of  the  mansions  will  maximize  the  use  of  low-
impact  traditional  techniques  and  locally  avail-
able  building  materials  to  reduce  the  additional 
embodied energy the project will create. 

existing buildings to construct new ones generates 
additional  greenhouse  gas  emissions  during 
demolition, debris and waste disposal, production 
of  new  materials,  and  assembly  of  replacement 
buildings. 

There  is  a  common  misperception  that  historic 
buildings  are  energy  ineﬃcient,  and  that  the 
environmental  impacts  of  demolition  and  new 
construction are easily outweighed by the energy 
savings  from  contemporary,  green  buildings.  In 
fact,  recent  research  has  found  that  conserving, 
reusing,  and  retroﬁtting  existing  buildings  are 
often  better  options.  This  saves  the  embodied 
energy used in the construction of older buildings—
and in addition, buildings constructed before the 
advent of cheap fossil fuels actually operate more 
eﬃciently  than  most  late-20th-century  buildings, 
according  to  a  groundbreaking  study  of  the  U.S. 
Energy Information Administration (2006). 

The  study,  which  has  since  been  followed  by 
a  number  of  similar  investigations  worldwide, 
concluded  that  contemporary,  highly  energy-
eﬃcient  buildings  require  the  same  operational 
energy  as  historic  assets  built  before  the  1920s 
(Figure  13).  This  ﬁnding  is  based  on  a  simple 
analysis  of  the  operational  energy  needed  for 
similar categories of existing buildings still in use, 
by  year  of  construction.  Only  assets  built  in  the 
second half of the 20th century are energy ineﬃ-
cient—a result of the low cost of energy at the time 
of their construction. 

In  contrast,  earlier  building  designers  and  devel-
opers faced very high energy costs, and addressed 
this  in  their  designs  and  construction  methods. 
Generally,  historic  buildings  have  thick,  solid 
walls  with  high  thermal  mass  that  reduces  the 
amount of operational energy needed for heating 
and cooling. Moreover, buildings designed before 
the widespread use of electricity feature windows 
designed for natural light and ventilation, as well 
as  shaded  porches  and  other  details  to  reduce

solar  gain.  In  the  past,  designers  and  developers 
also  paid  close  attention  to  location,  orientation, 
and  landscaping  as  methods  for  maximizing 
sun  exposure  during  the  winter  months  and 
minimizing  it  during  warmer  months  (that  is, 
passive heating and cooling systems).

Historic  buildings  are  also  mostly  located  in 
densely  built  areas  that  were  the  norm  in  the 
era  before  cars  proliferated  and  urban  sprawl 
became  prevalent,  and  so  they  gain  the  beneﬁts 
of  compactness  discussed  in  Chapter  2.  District 

energy systems can be used for power generation, 
as China has been doing for decades, which also 
creates substantial carbon savings. Municipal infra-
structure requirements for roads, sewers, commu-
nication,  power,  and  water  are  also  reduced  by 
high-density  developments,  which  is  where  most 
historic buildings are located. Thus, the adaptive 
reuse  and  repurposing  of  historic  buildings, 
together with the provision of appropriate retroﬁt 
measures, can contribute to signiﬁcant energy and

52 BUILDING SUSTAINABILITY IN AN URBANIZING WORLD

Transportation

Transport  now  contributes  13  percent  of  global 
greenhouse gas emissions (Metz. et al. 2007), and 
these  emissions  are  likely  to  increase  exponen-
tially in developing countries, where demand for 
private  transportation  is  rapidly  increasing  (Box 

24).  This  demand  has  to  be  managed  carefully 
from  the  outset,  because  transport  sector  invest-
ments are resource-intensive and very diﬃcult to 
undo. Once road and rail networks are established 
and entire communities grow around them, retro-
actively  replanning  employment  and  population 
centers  is  an  almost  impossible  undertaking 

 

4The Urgent Need for Sustainable Urban Transport

The global vehicle ﬂeet is set to increase from approxi-
mately 800 million to between 2 and 3 billion by 2050 
if we continue on a businessÐasÐusual path, with most 
of  the  growth  taking  place  in  developing  countries 
(UNEP 2011). With the middle class in developing coun-
tries  becoming  more  afﬂuent  and  more  dependent 
on  private  vehicles,  cheaper  vehicles  such  as  the  Tata 
Nano and Bajaj RE60 becoming available (at a cost of 
around $2,500), and slow turnover of vehicle stock, both 
the  demand  for  transport  fuels  and  associated  emis-
sions  are  expected  to  further  increase  in  the  coming 
years.  The  lack  of  progress  towards  increasing  vehicle 
fuel efﬁciency and reducing the carbon content of fuel, 
coupled with the increase in the number of vehicle-miles 
traveled,  is  already  negating  air  pollution  reductions 
resulting from the adoption of green transport systems 
such as bus rapid transit, light rail, and subways. If not 
contained, the increase in emissions from the transport 
sector will offset greenhouse gas reductions being made 
in other sectors. There are three sources of concern:

Transport fuels are large emitters of pollut-
ants.  Road  transportation  vehicles  emit  harmful 
substances such as carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, 
non-methanous volatile organic compounds, methane, 
nitrogen oxides, particulate matter, and sulfur dioxide. 
While gasoline-fueled vehicles account for 80 percent 
to  90  percent  of  total  volatile  organic  compounds 
and  carbon  monoxide,  diesel  vehicles  are  the  main 
source of nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, and particu-
lates  (Rodrigue  2013).  They  account  for  66  percent 
of nitrogen oxides, 70 percent sulfur dioxide, and 90 
percent of particulate emissions. In many megacities 
in Asia, particulate matter already exceeds 300 micro-
grams per cubic meter, which is above the WHO stan-
dard—and levels are rising. Road transport is a major 

cause of urban smog, which is a mixture of smoke, fog, 
and chemical fumes. 

The current and expected growth in trans-
port fuel demand will cause a tremendous 
public  health  burden.  Particulate  pollution  has 
been  found  to  increase  chronic  cough  in  children. 
Prospective  cohort  studies  conducted  by  the  Amer-
ican Cancer Society found that long-term exposure to 
particulate matter is associated with respiratory illness 
in  children.  Epidemiological  and  clinical  investiga-
tions suggest a strong link between particulate pollu-
tion  and  cardiopulmonary  morbidity  and  mortality. 
According to the Clean Air Task Force (2005), diesel 
exhaust poses a cancer risk 7.5 times higher than the 
combined total cancer risk from all other air toxins.

Growing  transport  fuel  demand  in  devel-
oping countries, particularly for diesel, will 
accelerate global climate change. The trans-
port sector accounts for 13 percent of all greenhouse 
gas  emissions  and  23  percent  of  all  energy-related 
carbon  dioxide  emissions  globally.  The  troubling 
aspect  of  transport-sector  emissions  is  that  they 
are  increasing  quite  rapidly  and  will  continue  to  do 
so in the years and decades to come. Carbon dioxide 
emissions from the transport sector increased by 28 
percent between 1990 and 2006. They are expected to 
rise by another 57 percent in the period 2005–2030, 
and by 2050 they will be up 120 percent from 2000 
levels. Black carbon, along with methane, is one of the 
major  global  warming  agents  after  carbon  dioxide. 
Increased  use  of  diesel  fuel  in  the  transport  sector 
will lead to further increases in particulate emissions, 
including black carbon, as vehicles tend to be poorly 
maintained in developing countries. 

(World  Bank  2010a).  A  lower-emission  trajectory 
can be achieved if government-backed alternatives 
for low-carbon development gain traction. 

The  discussion  on  urban  transport  goes  hand  in 
hand with city density and land use. As discussed in 
Chapter 2, there is empirical evidence that denser 
cities emit less greenhouse gas, have greater satis-
faction and well-being, and provide transportation 
services at much lower cost than sprawling cities. In 
many  cases,  transport  mode  choice  management 
combined with and land use management has led 
to  cost-eﬃcient  use  of  valuable  urban  land  and 
infrastructure.  Portland,  Oregon,  has  saved  $2 
billion  annually  through  three  decades  of  coordi-
nated  policies  to  change  land  use  and  transport 
systems.  Measures  include  modest  increases  in 
building  density,  light  rail  transit  schemes,  and 
policies  to  encourage  walking  and  cycling.  Other 
cities like Copenhagen, Hong Kong, London, New 
York,  Paris,  Singapore,  Vienna,  and  Zurich  show 
that it is possible to foster green growth, decoupling 
economic “goods” from environmental “bads.”

There is a wide consensus that the policy package 
to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from transport 
should contain three types of policies: reductions 
in private motorized transportation and increases 
in public and non-motorized modes of transport, 
increases in the fuel eﬃciency of vehicles and the 
use of alternative fuels, and promotion of density 
and eﬃcient public transportation. These actions 
have concrete and measurable co-beneﬁts. Annex 
4  summarizes  the  policies  that  15  cities  around 
the world have adopted to increase their eﬃciency 
and reduce the negative environmental impact of 
emissions. 

To  increase  ridership  on  public  transit,  cities 
have 
improved  the  existing  public  transpor-
tation  network,  subsidized  the  cost  of  transit 
(for  examples  from  China,  see  Hu  et  al.  2010), 
improved the safety of the system, and made eﬀorts 
to better communicate service times and delays to

Congestion Pricing

Policy  tools  such  as  congestion  pricing  have 
been  successful  in  reducing  demand  for  private 
transportation. For example, London’s congestion 
charge has reduced congestion by an estimated 
30 percent between February 2003 and February 
2004  in  comparison  to  the  same  period  in 
previous years (Transport for London 2004), and 
carbon  dioxide  emissions  from  trafﬁc  inside  the 
charging zone were cut by 19.5 percent (Carslaw 
2005).

Congestion  costs  are  even  higher  in  rapidly 
growing  developing-country  cities.  The  costs  of 
congestion are estimated at 3.4 percent of local 
GDP in Buenos Aires, 2.6 percent in Mexico City, 
and  3.4  percent  in  Dakar  (World  Bank  2002). 
Mexico City and Bogotá have introduced number 
plate  restrictions  with  measurable  impacts  on 
congestion and air quality (Mahendra 2008). 

customers. Cities have also facilitated biking—for 
example, by replacing lanes for vehicle traﬃc with 
protected  bike-only  lanes  and  by  installing  clear 
signage  of  bicycle  routes  and  rights-of-way  (as  in 
Montreal, Paris, and Rio de Janeiro). Local author-
ities can also pursue alternative modes of transport 
to manage freight movement. Some European port 
cities  provide  incentives  for  alternatives  to  truck 
transport:  Antwerp  provides  subsidies  for  inland 
river  transport,  while  Rotterdam  has  dedicated 
freight railways. 

To  reduce  emissions  from  urban  transport,  the 
alternatives 
include  reducing  emissions  per 
kilogram of fuel combusted by replacing the usual 
fossil fuels with less polluting fuels (for example, 
natural  gas  or  electricity);  reducing  the  fuel 
combusted  per  kilometer  traveled,  by  promoting 
greater  vehicle  eﬃciency;  and  reducing  the 
vehicle-kilometers traveled through measures such 
as congestion charges (Box 25), vehicle registration 
quotas, and replacement of private motor vehicles 
by public transportation. 

54 BUILDING SUSTAINABILITY IN AN URBANIZING WORLD

Complementary  measures  including  ﬁscal  policy 
(fuel  tax,  vehicle  tax,  congestion,  and  parking 
charges), regulatory policy (fuel standards, emission 
standards,  and  vehicle  inspection),  urban  planning 
(high density and transit-oriented development), and 
temporary subsidies and tax breaks can also be used 
to contain rising emissions from urban transport in 
developing  countries.  In  addition,  many  countries 
promote  the  purchase  of  ultra low-carbon  vehicles 
through subsidies. In Belgium, Canada, China, the 
Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United 
States, those subsidies can be as large as $7,000 per 
vehicle  (Perkins  2011).  While  developing  countries 
may not be able to aﬀord such high consumer incen-
tives,  they  can  reduce  urban  transport  emissions 
by  speeding  up  the  turnover  of  the  vehicle  stock. 
Temporary subsidies and tax breaks may encourage 
people to trade in their old, higher-polluting vehicles 
and  promote  environmentally  friendly  transpor-
tation choices like compressed natural gas (CNG). 

The introduction of cleaner transport fuel has major 
air-quality beneﬁts. In response to extreme deterio-
ration of air quality in Delhi, the Supreme Court of 
India passed an order in 1998 to reduce vehicular 
pollution. It called for replacement of all pre-1990 
automobiles and taxis with new vehicles using clean 
fuels, conversion of buses older than eight years to 
CNG  or  other  clean  fuels,  and  steady  conversion 
of  the  entire  city  bus  ﬂeet  to  a  single  clean  fuel 
mode  by  March  31,  2001.  Since  2001,  Delhi  has 
become the city with highest fraction of CNG-run 
public  vehicles  in  the  world.  The  impact  of  CNG 
conversion has led to a very large improvement in 
air quality. Between 2000 and 2003, there was a 34.8 
percent reduction in emissions of sulfur dioxide, 2.8 
percent in small particulate matter, and 7 percent in 
PM10 (Chelani, Asha, and Devotta 2007). 

Green  concerns  are  present  in  many  large  cities’ 
transportation plans. In recent years, older, more 
established cities such as Amsterdam, Copenhagen, 
London and New York have invested in pro-cycling 
and  walking  strategies,  while  younger  cities  such 

as  Bogotá,  Parana,  and  São  Paulo  have  invested 
in bus rapid transit solutions with well-established 
success. The plan prepared by Beijing for the 2008 
Olympics focused on public transportation (metro 
and  light  rail),  stringent  vehicle  emission  limits, 
encouraging  the  use  of  automobiles  powered  by 
cleaner fuels, converting 90 percent of public buses 
and  70  percent  of  taxis  to  cleaner  energy,  and 
pricing downtown parking lots. In Hong Kong, to 
reduce vehicle emissions, the city is expanding and 
upgrading the public transport infrastructure with 
an  emphasis  on  railways  and  using  tax  incentive 
schemes for environment-friendly private cars and 
commercial  vehicles.  This  tax  incentive  system 
includes  a  30  percent  reduction  in  the  ﬁrst  regis-
tration tax (FRT) for vehicles that have at least 40 
percent  higher-than-average  fuel  eﬃciency  in  the 
corresponding private car class.12

In the case of Singapore, the city energy program 
is  committed  to  (a)  increasing  the  share  of  public 
transport  modes  from  63  percent  to  over  70 
percent  in  the  next  10–15  years;  (b)  promoting 
less  polluting  cars  with  a  green  vehicle  rebate;  (c) 
raising  consumer  awareness  with  a  fuel  economy 
labeling scheme; and (d) managing road congestion 
through infrastructure development, reﬁnement of 
car ownership and usage restraint measures such as 
an electronic road-pricing system. 

Water

Sustainable cities face two main issues regarding 
the water sector (Miller and Yates 2006). First, they 
need to prepare for potential disruptions in water 
supply  associated  with  global  climate  change.  A 
recent  study  indicates  that  61  percent  of  cities 
foresee  substantive  risks  to  their  water  supply  in 
the  future  (CDP  2012);  the  two  most  common 
risks  are  increased  water  stress  or  scarcity  and 
declining  water  quality.  The  next  chapter  looks 
at addressing these risks in the context of climate 

12http://www.epd.gov.hk/epd/english/climate_change/transport.html

PART II: THE PATH TO SUSTAINABILITY 55

change adaptation. Second, the optimal approach 
to making the water sector more eﬃcient and less 
greenhouse gas-intensive needs to be determined. 

Water provision is carbon intensive because of the 
energy  used  to  extract  water,  treat  it,  pump  and 
distribute it, and collect and treat wastewater. In 
many  developing  countries,  water  utilities  bear 
the  cost  of  energy  losses  caused  by  ineﬃcient 
distribution  networks,  losses  in  the  underground 
water  network,  and  ineﬃcient  pumping  stations. 
Annually about half of the clean water is lost. To 
save water, greenhouse gas emissions and money, 
water  authorities  can  improve  water  pumping 
installations,  which  are  generally  over-designed 
and  hence  consume  more  energy.  They  can  also 
use renewable energy such as solar or wind power 
for pumping, although this may incur initial higher 
costs.  In  addition,  integrated  water  management 
involving  rainwater  harvesting,  separation  of 
wastewater  by  source  and  water-eﬃcient  ﬁxtures 
can  lead  to  energy  savings  and  greenhouse  gas 
reductions. 

Many  cities  are  currently  planning  for  and 
ﬁnancing  investments  in  water  infrastructure 
retroﬁts,  which  can  be  cost-eﬀective  when 
ﬁnancing for new infrastructure is hard to obtain. 
Cities  also  need  to  promote  more  eﬃcient  water 
management  through  smart  water  policies  and 
better information for consumers. As in the case 
of energy, decentralized systems may be an alter-
native to centralized, piped water supply systems, 
particularly  in  fast-growing  cities  in  Africa  and 
Asia.  Water  conservation  can  be  encouraged  by 
proper pricing, eﬃciency standards for appliances, 
incentives  to  use  low-ﬂow  appliances,  education 
and information outreach, and focused eﬀorts to 
promote conservation (OECD 2011b). 

Moreover,  cities  could  pass  regulations 
to 
increase  the  use  of  recycled  water.  For  example, 
in  Melbourne,  households  are  required  to  use 
recycled water (metered and delivered separately) 

rather  than  potable  water  for  toilet  ﬂushing, 
washing cars, and landscape watering. A study of 
12 cities in Canada and the United States found that 
watering restrictions on outdoor watering could be 
replaced by drought pricing, leading to equivalent 
water  savings  (Mansur  2007).  Toronto’s  Water-
Saver program provides cash incentives for indus-
trial  and  institutional  facilities  to  reduce  water 
consumption. The reductions in consumption are 
high enough to enable the city to buy back water 
or sewer capacity (OECD 2011b).

Solid Waste Management 

Eﬀective  management  of  municipal  solid  waste 
(MSW) poses “one of the biggest challenges of the 
urban  world”  (UN-Habitat  2010a).  Global  waste 
production  is  increasing;  currently,  the  world’s 
cities produce 1.3 billion tonnes of waste annually, 
and they will produce 2.2 billion tonnes by 2025 
(Hoornweg  and  Bhada-Tata  2012).  This  waste 
directly aﬀects environmental and public health at 
local and global scales, and the task of managing 
it in a socially, environmentally, and economically 
acceptable manner falls almost entirely to cities.

On  a  local  scale,  improper  waste  management, 
especially  open  dumping  and  open  burning, 
pollutes water bodies, contaminates air and land, 
and attracts disease vectors. People who live near 
or  work  with  solid  waste  have  increased  disease 
burdens  (Giusti  2009).  On  a  global  scale,  solid 
waste  currently  contributes  to  climate  change 
(emitting  5  percent  of  total  greenhouse  gases), 
though waste has the potential to be a net sink of 
greenhouse gases if it is used as a resource through 
recycling and reuse (Bogner et al. 2007). Some air 
pollutants emitted via waste incineration, such as 
dioxins  and  furans,  mix  globally  and  thus  aﬀect 
the Earth’s ecosystems and air quality. 

In  any  given  city,  waste  management  can  be 
described in terms of six components: generation, 
collection,  source  handling,  transport,  treatment, 

56 BUILDING SUSTAINABILITY IN AN URBANIZING WORLD

and  disposal  (Tchobanoglous  and  Krieth  2002). 
The  chain  begins  with  waste  generation,  which 
varies with wealth, culture, climate, demographics, 
and time. As such, waste quantity and composition 
are location- and context-speciﬁc. Generally, waste 
quantity  and  complexity  increase  with  aﬄuence 
and urbanization. The amount of MSW per capita 
appears  to  be  positively  correlated  with  devel-
opment, as measured by the Human Development 
Index  (Figure  14),  as  well  as  with  urbanization 
(Figure  15).  But  while  citizens  of  all  urbanized 
regions  tend  to  produce  more  waste,  OECD 
residents are global outliers, generating far more 
waste  than  those  from  any  other  region  (Figure 
15).  Other  variables  such  as  wealth  and  culture 
contribute to this greater waste generation. 

Figure 16 shows that the large expected increase 
in  urban  population  (particularly  in  Africa;  see 

Annex  1)  will  bring  commensurate  increases  in 
waste.  This  ﬁgure  does  not  show  causality,  but 
does suggest future growth in waste production as 
the world urbanizes and develops. Note that, while 
rates  of  MSW  generation  per  capita  are  already 
declining in OECD countries, Sub-Saharan Africa 
and South Asia are not projected to reach “peak 
waste” generation before 2100. This is problematic 
because  these  two  regions  will  also  have  the 
highest total urban populations by 2100, followed 
by East Asia and the Paciﬁc, whose waste gener-
ation rates are projected to plateau only by 2075. 
Latin  America  and  the  Caribbean,  the  Middle 
East and North Africa, and Eastern Europe and 
Central Asia are projected to reach peak waste by 
approximately 2050, but the impact of this earlier 
peak will be less signiﬁcant because these are not 
the regions where urban population growth will be 
concentrated.

58 BUILDING SUSTAINABILITY IN AN URBANIZING WORLD

The composition of the waste that cities generate 
changes with demographics. Wealthier cities tend 
to  produce  more  complex  waste,  with  a  higher 
proportion  of  electronics  and  plastics,  which 
are  harder  to  manage.  Electronic  waste  poses 
a  particular  threat  to  developing  cities,  since  it 
contains toxic materials and is often exported from 
wealthier to poorer nations, where it is informally 
managed  (Williams  2008).  Lower-income  cities 
tend to have a higher relative organic fraction in 
their  waste;  this  less  complex  waste  is  relatively 
easy to manage. However, the global proliferation 
of disposable consumer products is increasing the 
complexity of waste everywhere. 

To  deal  with  more  diﬃcult  waste,  cities  need  to 
reduce  waste  production  through  market-based 
instruments such as weight-based waste fees (often 
known  as  “pay  as  you  throw”).  Another  possi-
bility, borrowed from the energy sector, is positive 
feedback  mechanisms.  In  one  study,  residents 
received their energy bills along with information 
about 
the  average  community  consumption, 
marked  with  a  “smiley  face”  if  they  used  less 
energy than average. The residents who saw this 
positive feedback reduced their consumption even 
further (Thaler and Sunstein 2008).

The  next  component  of  waste  management, 
collection, is an essential precursor to further waste 
treatment. Collection rates in low-income cities are 
low (<50 percent), and collection costs represent a 
high fraction (80–90 percent) of municipal waste 
budgets.  For  middle-income  cities,  collection  is 
more widespread (50–80 percent) and represents a 
smaller portion of the MSW budget. High-income 
cities  spend  a  smaller  portion  on  collection  (<10 
percent  of  MSW  budget),  because  they  spend 
much more on processing and treatment, and they 
tend  to  have  high  collection  rates  (>90  percent) 
(Hoornweg and Bhada-Tata 2012). In developing 
cities, where the informal sector plays an important 
role  in  providing  waste  management  services, 

integrating  these  actors  to  maximize  collection 
and waste treatment is important. 

Cities  can  choose  from  a  number  of  waste 
treatment  technologies  that  convert  waste  to 
more useful products and mitigate environmental 
and  health  risks.  Biogenic  waste  can  become  a 
nutrient  source  through  composting,  electricity 
via  anaerobic  digestion,  or  liquid  fuel  through 
conversion  to  ethanol  or  biodiesel.  Technologies 
that  transform  biogenic  waste  are  particularly 
applicable  in  less  industrialized  cities  (and  rural 
areas). Non-biogenic waste can be reused, or made 
into  new  products,  via  recycling;  it  can  also  be 
converted to energy, via thermal processes (incin-
eration,  pyrolysis,  and  gasiﬁcation).  Recycling  is 
globally  ubiquitous,  though  the  formality  of  its 
practice varies; thermal treatment is most appro-
priate  in  places  that  are  rich  in  ﬁnancial  and 
technical resources. 

Finally,  all  waste  management  systems  need  a 
safe method for disposal. A continuum of disposal 
options  exist  in  practice,  from  open  dumping—
which poses the greatest environmental and health 
hazards—to  sanitary  landﬁlling  (engineered  facil-
ities designed to collect and treat all of the waste’s 
byproducts). 

Eﬀorts  toward  sustainable  waste  management 
include  a  number  of  conceptual  approaches. 
The  “waste  hierarchy,”  developed  in  the  1990s, 
ranks  environmentally  sound  waste  treatment 
technologies.  Two  recent  schools  of  thought, 
integrated  waste  management  and 
industrial 
ecology, aim to see waste as a resource. Integrated 
waste  management  is  a  set  of  principles—rather 
than  a  prescription—that  aims  to  minimize  the 
environmental and health burden of waste while 
maximizing its beneﬁcial reuse and safely disposing 
of  waste  that  is  not  reused.  The  ﬁeld  of  indus-
trial ecology proposes that waste management in 
human  systems  could  mimic  natural  systems;  it 

PART II: THE PATH TO SUSTAINABILITY 59

challenges  the  concept  of  waste,  instead  viewing 
all outputs as inputs into other processes.

Another approach taken by some cities, in the 
context of green growth and sustainable urban 
development, is to use greenhouse gas emissions 
as a metric to assess the sustainability of their 
waste  management  systems.  However,  waste 
management professionals know that there is no 
one-size-ﬁts-all  solution  to  waste  management. 
Cities need local, innovative methods, adapted to 
their residents, their waste, and their resources.

Building Adaptive and Resilient Cities

Key Messages
 (cid:96) Cities, regardless of their level of development, are particularly vulnerable to disasters and 

shocks because they concentrate people and enterprises. Many of the world’s largest cities are 
located on low-lying coasts, rivers and other vulnerable areas where the impacts of climate 
change will be most severe. 

 (cid:96) The need for cities to reduce their emissions is well-established, but the need to adapt to climate 

change and build resilience in cities is not as widely integrated into urban planning. Integrating 
mitigation and adaptation efforts at the local government level is critical as it will lead to more 
robust climate change policies and strengthen climate action in cities. 

 (cid:96) As cities prepare for changing weather patterns, they become more resilient. Resilient systems 

have the capacity to absorb external shocks and continue to function by reorganizing and 
adapting. In fact, change and disruptions can create opportunities for development, innovation, 
and prosperity in a resilient city. 

 (cid:96) Urban resilience increasingly depends on multi-sectoral partnerships involving local government 

action, private sector participation, and community-based risk management.

While many developing cities will have the oppor-
tunity  to  avoid  the  path  of  their  partners  in  the 
global North and adopt greener growth, the threat 
from climate change is signiﬁcant. The new wave 
of  urban  investment  should  provide  an  oppor-
tunity  for  cities  to  consider  and  design  adequate 
protection against warming temperatures, erratic 
weather,  natural  disasters,  sea  level  rise,  ﬂoods, 
droughts,  and  other  potential  consequences  of 
climate change. 

Not  only  have  cities  have  contributed  the  largest 
share  of  the  world’s  greenhouse  gas  emissions, 
they  also  concentrate  many  of  the  people  most 
at  risk  from  the  eﬀects  of  climate  change—and 
the  enterprises  that  generate  most  of  the  gross 
world  product  (Satterthwaite  et  al.  2009).  These 
patterns  do  not  necessarily  overlap;  most  of  the 
cities  that  face  the  highest  risks  are  those  with 
small greenhouse gas contributions, and most also 

have serious constraints on their capacity to adapt 
to climate change (see Box 26). But although the 
need  for  cities  to  reduce  their  emissions  is  well-
established,  the  need  to  reduce  urban  residents’ 
climate vulnerability is not. 

Thus,  urban  adaptation  eﬀorts  are  only  in  their 
initial  stages.  At  a  minimum,  a  well-planned, 
well-established,  successful  city  will  already  have 
taken  measures  in  the  past  to  ensure  its  ability 
to  withstand  extreme  weather  events.  However, 
urban planners and managers must now consider 
measures  to  adapt  their  cities’  buildings,  infra-
structure,  industry,  institutions,  and  services  to 
the  impacts  of  climate  change.  There  are  many 
ways  to  do  this,  ranging  from  adjustments  in 
building  codes  and  land  use  regulations  to  the 
use of insurance to spread risk, to eﬀective, well-
established  emergency  management  services 
(Sattherthwaite et al. 2009). Going forward, these 

Glossary of Terms Related to Adaptation

(cid:3)(cid:96) Adaptation  and  mitigation  linkages:  Mitigation 
results  in  avoiding  adverse  impacts  of  climate 
change  in  the  long  run  (at  least  the  incremental 
impacts due to greenhouse gas not emitted), while 
adaptation can reduce the unavoidable impacts in 
the  near  term  (but  cannot  reduce  them  to  zero). 
Failure to mitigate will lead eventually to failure to 
adapt;  hence,  adaptation  and  mitigation  are  not 
alternative  strategies  but  complementary  ones 
that need to be pursued together (Sattherthwaite 
et al. 2009). 

(cid:3)(cid:96) Adaptive capacity: Inherent capacity of a system 
(such  as  city  government),  population  (such  as  a 
low-income  community  in  a  city),  or  individual/
household to take actions that can help avoid loss 
and  speed  recovery  from  any  impact  of  climate 
change.  Elements  of  adaptive  capacity  include 
knowledge,  institutional  capacity,  and  ﬁnancial 
and  technological  resources.  Low-income  popu-
lations  in  a  city  will  tend  to  have  lower  adaptive 
capacity because they are unable to afford good-
quality housing on safe sites and avoid dangerous 
livelihoods. There is also a wide range in adaptive 
capacity  among  city  and  national  governments, 
relating  to  the  resources  available  to  them,  the 
information  base  to  guide  action,  the  infrastruc-
ture in place, and the quality of their institutions 
and  governance  systems  (Sattherthwaite  et  al. 
2009).

(cid:3)(cid:96) Maladaptation:  Actions  or 

investments 

that 
increase  rather  than  reduce  vulnerability  to 
impacts  of  climate  change.  This  can  include  the 
shifting  of  vulnerability  from  one  social  group 
or  place  to  another;  it  also  includes  shifting  risk 
to  future  generations  and/or  to  ecosystems  and

ecosystem services. Many investments being made 
in cities are, in fact, maladaptive rather than adap-
tive, as they decrease resilience to climate change. 
Removing  maladaptation  is  often  the  ﬁrst  task 
to  be  addressed,  even  prior  to  new  adaptations 
(Sattherthwaite et al. 2009).

(cid:3)(cid:96) Resilience: Resilience is a product of governments, 
enterprises,  populations,  and 
individuals  with 
strong adaptive capacity. It indicates a capacity to 
maintain  core  functions  in  the  face  of  hazardous 
threats  and  impacts,  especially  for  vulnerable 
populations. It usually requires a capacity to antici-
pate  climate  change  and  to  plan  needed  adapta-
tions.  The  resilience  of  any  population  group  to 
climate change interacts with its resilience to other 
dynamic  pressures,  including  economic  change, 
conﬂict, and violence. 

(cid:3)(cid:96) Urban  resilience:  The  degree  to  which  cities  are 
able  to  tolerate  alteration  before  reorganizing 
around  a  new  set  of  structures  and  processes 
(Alberti et al. 2003). As such, it can be measured 
by how well a city balances ecosystem, economic, 
and social functions; by how it responds to gradual 
impacts like climate change or sudden impacts like 
natural  disasters;  and  by  its  ability  to  capitalize 
on positive opportunities that emerge as a result 
of  change  (Berkes  and  Folke  1998,  Barnett  2001, 
Alberti et al. 2003). 

(cid:3)(cid:96) Vulnerability: The propensity of social and ecolog-
ical  systems  to  suffer  harm  from  exposure  to 
external  stresses  and  shocks  (Stockholm  Resil-
ience Institute 2012). The term is often used as an 
antonym of resilience. 

62 BUILDING SUSTAINABILITY IN AN URBANIZING WORLD

adaptation  measures  need  to  be  integrated  with 
plans  to  mitigate  climate  change  through  more 
eﬃcient city systems (Box 27). 

Climate Change Vulnerability  
in Urban Areas

There  is  consensus  that  large-scale  disasters  are 
increasing  in  frequency  worldwide,  largely  due 
to  weather-related  events.  Many  of  the  extreme 
weather  events  that  have  caused  signiﬁcant 
economic  and  human  loss  in  the  past  60  years 
have taken place in urban areas or aﬀected them 
indirectly (for example, through immigration from 
aﬀected  areas  or  interrupted  service  provision). 
Some  of  these  weather  events  are  considered  to 
be early manifestations of climate change, and in 
future, profound modiﬁcations of the climate will 

in the future have considerably greater impacts on 
cities, from ﬂooding to heat waves. 

According  to  the  Intergovernmental  Panel  on 
Climate Change (Parry et al. 2007), the estimated 
economic  impacts  of  extreme  weather  in  the 
past range from a 3 percent GDP loss in Central 
America  as  a  result  of  an  El  Niño  year  to  a  7 
percent GDP loss for Honduras during Hurricane 
Mitch.  These  aggregate  ﬁgures  obscure  impacts 
much  higher  than  the  average  in  some  locations 
(Sattherthwaite  et  al.  2009).  Disasters  are  a 
product of hazards interacting with a vulnerable 
population; understanding the intricacies of local 
vulnerabilities,  along  with  the  hazards  to  which 
a city is exposed (Figure 17), is essential to build 
resilience in urban centers. 

7Beneﬁts of Integrating Mitigation and Adaptation
2

B

Mitigation  will  not  progress  quickly  enough  to  avoid 
signiﬁcant  climate  change  impacts,  hence  adapta-
tion  is  necessary.  At  the  same  time,  given  the  scale 
of  expected  impacts,  adaptation  cannot  be  the  only 
response to climate change. Both approaches are not 
only  necessary,  but  complementary  (Wilbanks  and 
Sathaye 2007). Linking mitigation and adaptation at 
the  local  government  level  is  expected  to  enhance 
and  strengthen  the  potential  impacts  of  both  types 
of climate action. By not coordinating mitigation and 
adaptation  efforts,  urban  planners  run  the  risk  of 
increasing  local  greenhouse  gas  emissions  through 
adaptation measures or increasing local vulnerability 
as a result of mitigation measures. As an example, a 
stand-alone  mitigation  strategy  might  recommend  a 

 

higher concentration of housing developments close 
to the city center, while an adaptation strategy could 
shed light on the fact that the city center is located 
in  a  ﬂood-prone  area,  where  high-density  housing 
increases the vulnerability of local residents to disas-
ters (Bizikova et al. 2008). Integrating mitigation and 
adaptation  efforts  minimizes  the  chances  of  dupli-
cation  or  maladaptation  and  produces  more  robust 
climate change policies to reduce the costs and nega-
tive impacts of climate change. For instance, improve-
ments  in  building  energy  efﬁciency  can  reinforce 
both  adaptation  and  mitigation  goals  (Wilbanks  and 
Sathaye 2007). When the relationships between miti-
gation and adaptation are ignored, there is a risk of 
failure in both areas.

Cities  face  two  types  of  climate-related  risks: 
catastrophic  and  systemic.  Catastrophic  risks 
originate  from  poor  design  and  location  of  the 
built environment, including infrastructure. These 
risks include losses associated with violent winds, 
temperature  extremes,  and  sea  level  rise.  An 
example is the Hurricane Katrina disaster that, in 
New  Orleans  alone,  caused  nearly  800  deaths,  a 
loss  of  more  than  90,000  jobs,  and  $3  billion  in 
lost wages, with total ﬁnancial losses estimated at 
$200  billion.  The  2011  ﬂoods  and  landslides  in 
Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo left more than 800 
dead  and  20,000  homeless.  In  Australia  in  2011, 
Cyclone Yasi produced damages over $20 billion 
due to ﬂooding alone, with a large percentage of 
this occurring in urban areas (ICLEI 2011).

Of  the  20  megacities  in  2008,  15  are  in  low 
elevation coastal zones that are most vulnerable 
to the sea level rise and storm surges associated 
with climate change (Figure 18). Many other large 
cities  are  close  to  river  estuaries,  coastal  areas, 

and  other  vulnerable  sites  due  to  the  historical 
advantages  of  these  locations.  And  continued 
urbanization  is  putting  an  ever  greater  concen-
tration of population and assets in these high-risk 
sites (Box 28). 

Within  cities,  competition  for  land  drives  poorer 
urban dwellers to settle in higher-density marginal 
areas such as steep hillsides or ﬂood plains, which 
further  increases  exposure.  This  combination  of 
a higher degree of exposure and vulnerability of 
both people and assets within cities results in ever-
greater  social  and  economic  impacts  of  natural 
hazards. Thus, emerging, urbanizing cities should 
prioritize  risk  mapping  and  develop  policies  in 
accordance  with  these  ﬁndings.  For  instance,  if 
a  hazard  map  indicates  ﬂood  risk  in  an  up-and-
coming  coastal  area  of  the  city,  urban  planners 
can take preemptive measures and enact policies 
to ensure that industrial and residential areas are 
developed elsewhere.

tation costs, it is difﬁcult to conceive a way in which 
entire coastal cities will effectively retroﬁt for climate-
resilient development.

Large sections of cities with more than 10 million inhab-
itants (Mumbai, Shanghai and Dhaka, for instance) are 
at  risk  from  sea-level  rise.  The  economic  success  of 
these  cities  is  critical  for  their  overall  nations’  well 
being—both economically and culturally. In cities such 
as these, the exodus of private sector investment due 
to climate risk could have an important impact on the 
countries’ economies. 

Source: Sattherthwaite et al. (2009).

Many of the regions that are witnessing rapid urban 
growth and in-migration are located in coastal areas. 
This is of particular concern in the context of climate 
change where risk from sea-level rise and increases in 
the frequency and intensity of extreme weather pose 
a  serious  threat  to  the  infrastructure  and  economic 
development of the city—not to mention its residents.

There  is  a  tendency  for  private  investments  and 
enterprises  to  develop  in  coastal  areas  due  to  easy 
transportation access through ports. Such economic 
investments  further  reinforce  the  rapid  urbanization 
in coastal areas. While larger companies and corpora-
tions could eventually choose to relocate away from 
risk-prone coastal areas and assume higher transpor-

Case Study: Blackouts in India and the United States 

65

Resilience is not just a challenge for low- and middle-
income countries. Within a single month in 2012, both 
India and the United States experienced massive power 
outages that revealed vulnerable electricity grids. 

On  the  east  coast  of  the  United  States,  severe 
summer  storms  knocked  out  power  lines  through 
several states. The blackouts at the end of June 2012 
lasted several days—several weeks for many—affecting 
millions of people in the capital Washington, DC, and 
spreading  from  North  Carolina  to  New  Jersey  and 
as  far  west  as  Illinois.  A  record-breaking  heat  wave 
followed  the  next  week,  when  those  without  power 
had no way of combating the extreme temperatures. 
Ultimately, work crews from power utilities in Canada 
had to assist in the weeks-long effort to restore power.

In what has been called “the biggest blackout in the 
world,”  more  than  700  million  people  in  India  were 
without power a few weeks later, after the country’s 

electricity  supply  was  overloaded  by  fast-growing 
demand—even  though  only  66  percent  of  the  Indian 
population  has  access  to  electricity.a  Three  of  the 
country’s ﬁve electricity grids (four of which are inter-
connected) failed simultaneously, causing outages in 
20  of  India’s  28  states,  along  with  the  capital,  New 
Delhi. This led to cascading failures along thousands 
of miles of the commuter train system. It also affected 
the  operation  of  hospitals  and  other  crucial  urban 
systems, such as trafﬁc lights.

Such  cascading  failures  indicate  a  signiﬁcant  lack  of 
resilience in urban systems. In both rapidly-developing 
countries  and  the  world’s  largest  economy,  energy 
infrastructure  needs  to  be  diversiﬁed  from  genera-
tion to transmission to distribution. We must address 
vulnerable links such as power grids if we are to bring 
about more sustainable cities.

In addition to catastrophic risks, systemic climate-
related  risks  arise  from  poor  urban  design  and 
construction,  as  well  as  from  interruptions  to 
urban service provision and management systems. 
Systemic risks can lead to sustained losses due to 
highly ineﬃcient systems for health care, energy, 
water, and food supply, arising from poor mainte-
nance, old technology, and poor demand-side and 
life-cycle  management.  These  risks  have  been 
graphically  illustrated  by  sustained  water  and 
energy  supply  shortages  in  China,  India,  and 
western parts of the United States (ICLEI, 2011), 
and by blackouts in India and the eastern United 
States (Box 29). 

Put  another  way,  a  city’s  resilience  is  determined 
not only by its exposure to hazards and the vulner-

ability of its population and assets, but by its institu-
tional and community capacity to respond to stress. 
A paradigm shift is necessary to give equal emphasis 
to capacities, as opposed to the traditional technical 
approach of focusing on exposure to hazards.

urban development, typically to design and build 
cities that embody chronic systemic risk and often 
extreme  catastrophic  risk.  This  is  true  even  in 
aﬄuent regions such as Japan, California’s Silicon 
Valley, Vancouver’s coastal plains, or the low-lying 
and hurricane-prone southern Florida area. 

Adaptation Planning at the City Level 

Adaptation  to  climate  change  can  be  deﬁned  as 
the  set  of  organization,  location,  and  technical 
changes  that  societies  will  have  to  implement 
to  limit  the  negative  eﬀects  of  climate  change 
and  to  maximize  the  beneﬁcial  ones  (Hallegatte 
et  al.  2011).  Examples  of  adaptation  actions 
include  removing  populations  and  assets  from 
areas  at  risk,  protecting  infrastructure,  adjusting 
energy  networks  to  accommodate  variations  in 

energy  consumption  and  climate,  and  preparing 
emergency  response  plans  for  extreme  weather 
events (Box 30). 

across 

sectors 

Climate  change  adaptation  requires  eﬀective 
collaboration 
and  between 
multiple  stakeholders  (Box  31).  Cities  are  well 
positioned  to  convene  a  wide  range  of  partners 
such as government agencies, local communities, 
nonproﬁt  organizations,  academic  institutions, 
and  the  private  sector.  Under  uncertain  climate 
conditions,  partnerships  are  key  to  a  dynamic 
adaptation process that will allow cities to prepare, 
respond,  and  continue  on  their  path  toward 
sustainable  development  (World  Bank  2011). 
Chapter 6 discusses the roles that diﬀerent actors 
can take in such a process.

Provision  of  basic  services  in  cities  is  a  key  aspect 
of  adaptation  practice.  In  many  cities,  adaptation 
activities  are  already  being  mainstreamed  in  emer-
gency  planning  to  keep  citizens  safe  and  businesses 
operating  in  case  of  an  extreme  weather  event.  In 
Yokohama,  agreements  are  in  place  with  private 
companies to provide the city with food in case of a 
disruption to supply. Seattle has created a Vulnerable 
Populations  Action  Team  Community  Communica-
tion Network. This partnership between public health 
organizations,  community-based  organizations,  and 
community  leaders  ensures  that  important  health 
information  reaches  vulnerable  populations  in  the 
event of an emergency. In Chicago, the city maintains 
an Extreme Weather Operations Plan that prescribes 
actions during times of extreme heat, cold, or severe 

storms. As part of the city’s adaptation activities, the 
Department of Aviation Action is working to improve 
service for stranded passengers in the event of storms 
or extreme weather. 

New  York  has  several  emergency  and  disaster 
response plans, including a Natural Hazard Mitigation 
Plan, a Coastal Storm Plan, a Citywide Debris Manage-
ment Plan, a Power Disruption Plan, and a Flash Flood 
Emergency Plan. Johannesburg has developed a heat 
wave response plan, and many cities have programs 
to educate the public about how to prevent heatstroke 
and what to do in the event of a heat wave. A number 
of cities designate cooling centers for use by residents 
during extreme heat events.

These mountains had been quarried in an unregulated 
manner  for  decades  before  they  became  populated, 
causing slope instability. Recurring small-scale landslides 
affect local livelihoods, and as the mountain slopes ﬁll 
with people, more are harmed by these events. 

According  to  several  risk  assessments,  more  than  40 
neighborhoods in Altos de Cazucá cannot be legalized 
due  to  potential  geohazards.  Two  different  geologic 
risk  assessments  performed  by  the  Ministerio  de 
Planeación  de  Colombia  (Urban  Planning  Ministry  of 
Colombia) and the Japanese International Cooperation 
Agency  have  already  determined  that  certain  areas 
within the district are uninhabitable (JICA 2005). 

While the private sector has supported the local popu-
lation  through  service  provision,  the  local  govern-
ment  and  other  multilateral  and  nongovernmental 
institutions  have  grappled  with  relocation  and  other 
measures to make residents less vulnerable. The case 
of  Altos  de  Cazucá  shows  that  in  a  rapidly  urban-
izing area where different stakeholders are trying to 
support development, it is important to map risk and 
coordinate at multiple levels to build resilience (Baker-
Gallegos 2010).

Case Study: Growing Risks and Multiple Stakeholders in Altos de Cazucá

Urbanization  processes  are  complex,  involving  many 
stakeholders, and incentives for growth and develop-
ment can end up putting more people in the path of 
environmental hazard. An example is Altos de Cazucá, 
a  district  located  in  the  mountain  slopes  of  the 
Colombian  Municipality  of  Soacha,  the  most  densely 
populated municipality in the Department of Cundina-
marca  (which  includes  the  capital,  Bogotá).  Soacha 
has a total population of approximately half a million 
people;  accelerated  population  growth  is  mainly  due 
to economic opportunities in the municipality and in 
neighboring Bogotá, as well as internal displacement 
due to armed conﬂict (AINCA 2008, p. 4). 

The majority of properties in Altos de Cazucá are not 
titled or legally registered, and only 20 percent of the 
population has access to basic services such as drinking 
water, sewers, streets, or health services (OCHA 2006). 
Industrial  activities  are  the  main  source  of  income  in 
the municipality, and companies also facilitate develop-
ment by providing certain services such as electricity 
to  support  company  employees  who  live  in  the  area 
(AINCA  2008,  p.  24).  One  of  the  largest  industries  is 
mining; the mountains here are an important source of 
construction materials for Bogotá.

68 BUILDING SUSTAINABILITY IN AN URBANIZING WORLD

Most of the costs of adaptation will be borne by 
cities.  Cost  estimates  are  wide-ranging,  but  the 
UNFCCC  estimates  a  global  cost  of  $49–171 
billion  per  year  by  2030  (Parry  et  al.  2009),  and 
the World Bank (2010d) estimates $80–100 billion 
per year. Currently, adaptation is ﬁnanced mainly 
through  private  income,  national  and  municipal 
revenues,  grants  from  multilateral  and  bilateral 
institutions, and market-based mechanisms. There 
is ample room for cities to be creative in leveraging 
more  funding  from  donors  and  collaborating 
with the private sector to help ﬁnance adaptation 
(World Bank 2011).

information,  changing 

Public  policies  dealing  with  adaptation  have  four 
pillars: 
standards  and 
regulations,  improving  institutions,  and  changing 
investment  decisions.  The  ﬁrst  step  in  building 
adaptive capacity in a city is focused on information. 
In many cases, cities can gather data and map the 
communities, assets, and services that are vulnerable 
to  climate-related  risks,  and  have  a  clear  under-
standing  of  how  these  could  be  strengthened  to 
better confront impending climate change impacts. 
Providing all stakeholders with the best information 
available  will  help  them  handle  the  uncertainty 
around projected climate impacts (Box 32). 

Adaptation  can  be  reactive  (after  a  disaster)  or 
preventive  (before  a  disaster).  Politically,  it  is 
much  easier  to  channel  the  necessary  funds  to 
adaptation  after  the  fact.  However,  in  economic 
and  social  terms  it  makes  more  sense  to  act 
preventively, as the costs to economic assets and 
the existing social network are substantially lower 
(World Bank 2011). 

Often it is the responsibility of national or supra-
national  agencies  to  produce  knowledge  relevant 
to  impact  assessment  and  adaptation,  but  local 
governments still play an important role in estab-
lishing early warning systems for city residents. A 
classic example is Havana, where a very eﬀective 
early  warning  system  ensures  a  low  degree  of 
damage when the city is hit by storms and tornados. 

 

One of the difﬁculties in developing adaptation strat-
egies  is  dealing  with  uncertainty.  This  uncertainty 
results  from  three  components:  1)  uncertainty  about 
the  global  scenario  of  climate  change  (for  example, 
a  scenario  with  an  average  temperature  increase  of 
+2°C or one of +4°C), 2) how the global scenarios will 
translate at the local level,la and 3) uncertainty about 
the reaction of major cycles (for example, water) and 
ecosystems to global and local climate changes. 

2Incorporating Uncertainty in Adaptation Strategies
3
X

B

The  most  effective  method  to  take  uncertainty  into 
account is to ensure that stakeholders have the best 
information possible on the impacts of climate change 
and to encourage approaches that maintain ﬂexibility 
for  future  action  as  additional  information  becomes 
available. However, adaptation strategies are complex 

because of the dynamic nature of adaptation; we do 
not  adapt  in  a  linear  way,  going  directly  from  one 
point  to  another.  We  move  from  where  we  are  now 
to  a  moving  target:  a  perpetually  changing  climate. 
For  example,  a  building  constructed  in  2000  with  a 
lifespan of 150 years should be adapted to the current 
climate,  as  well  as  the  climate  in  2150,  which  will 
probably be very different from today’s climate. The 
combination  of  uncertainty  and  long  asset  lifespan 
leads to the risk of maladaptation.

aFor example, even for a given amount of global warming (measured 
as a change in global mean temperature), climate models diverge 
on the way in which climate change will affect the frequency and 
intensity of storm events in northern Europe. 

PART II: THE PATH TO SUSTAINABILITY 69

As knowledge on new risks is obtained, the next 
step  is  to  change  standards  and  regulations.  If 
long-term,  forward-thinking  policies  are  put  in 
place, the costs of adjusting to climate change can 
be  spread  through  time,  making  the  adaptation 
process  aﬀordable.  Furthermore,  the  process  of 
reducing  climate  change  risks  can  be  designed 
to  mitigate  emissions  and  reduce  other  environ-
mental risks at the same time. 

During  this  process,  local  institutions  have  an 
additional  role  in  balancing  the  interests  of  the 
diﬀerent  stakeholders,  for  example  in  the  case 
of  water  scarcity  or  public-private  partnerships. 
The  fourth  pillar  of  public  action  deals  with  the 
adaptation  of  existing  public  infrastructure  as 
well  as  public  buildings  in  general.  New  invest-
ments  in  infrastructure  and  buildings  must  also 
be  adapted—in  terms  of  size  and  location,  for 
example—and should be complemented by policies 
that restructure land use, including major invest-
ments  such  as  transportation  networks,  regional 
economic development projects, and so on. 

Increasingly,  cities  are  recognizing  the  need  to 
plan for climate change by developing stand-alone 
climate  plans  or  integrating  them  into  existing 
plans and policies. CDP Cities 2011: Global Report on 
C40  Cities  (CDP  2011)  evaluated  existing  climate 
change  adaptation  plans,  showing  that  about  25 
C40 cities have such plans. Interestingly, all C40 
cities  in  Africa  and  East  Asia  reported  that  they 
have climate change action plans, compared with 
less than half of C40 cities in Latin America. 

Protecting Urban Water Supplies

The  water  sector  provides  a  good  example  of 
complex  climate  impacts  and  the  need  for  new 
plans  and  tools  to  manage  urban  resources. 
Climate  change  can  aﬀect  water  availability 
through well-known scenarios such as warmer and 
shorter winter seasons, increased glacial melting, 
more  precipitation,  changes  in  the  recharge  of 

groundwater  aquifers,  and  warmer  and  poten-
tially drier summer seasons (AMWA 2007). These 
changes will lead to shortages of water and/or to 
higher probability of ﬂoods. 

There are indirect impacts as well. Severe storms 
and  ﬂooding  will  lead  to  water  pollution  from 
other  sources,  including  wastewater  treatment 
and  storage  systems.  In  most  countries,  waste-
water  treatment  plants  have  not  been  designed 
for  the  likely  changes  in  ﬂow  conditions  due  to 
climate change. As a result, it is conceivable that 
water  suppliers  will  face  challenges  from  sewage 
overﬂows,  resulting  in  high  concentrations  of 
unhealthy bacteria. More than 60 percent of cities 
report  that  they  foresee  substantial  risks  to  their 
water supply in the future. The two most common 
risks  are  increased  water  stress  or  scarcity  and 
declining water quality (CDP 2012).

Besides the possible reduction of water availability 
and  quality,  local  authorities  need  to  anticipate 
shifts  in  demand  for  water.  However,  the  water 
sector  often  suﬀers  from  insuﬃcient  capacity 
to  solve  technical  and  management  problems  as 
well  as  a  lack  of  cross-sectoral  coordination  and 
ﬁnancing diﬃculties. 

Many  water  utilities  have  begun  to  respond  to 
climate  change  by  trying  to  understand  how 
current  plans  could  be  disrupted  and  how  to 
modify  them.  These  eﬀorts  include  vulnerability 
analyses to identify where impacts could be felt the 
soonest,  and  integrated  resource  planning  (IRP) 
that  looks  at  all  possible  alternatives  for  coping 
with  systemic  changes  over  the  longer  term.  For 
example, technological advances such as recycled 
wastewater  and  desalination  of  seawater  may  be 
useful to address scarcity at the local level. Flood 
management—often  under  the  responsibility  of 
local  governments—can  be  addressed  in  part  by 
rainwater  harvesting  and  the  use  of  ecosystem 
services.  An  essential  part  of  this  integrated 
approach is the involvement of all stakeholders, as 

70 BUILDING SUSTAINABILITY IN AN URBANIZING WORLD

stakeholders have the capacity to redeﬁne some of 
the objectives and constraints when such ﬂexibility 
is necessary to avoid an impasse. 

The IRP approach can also be used to manage water 
demand.  Warming  processes  will  change  demand 
patterns  as  a  result  of  shifts  in  precipitation,  more 
evaporation, and more extensive droughts. Conser-
vation incentives (and disincentives to outdoor water 
use)  may  become  essential  if  warming  processes 
increase  water  demands,  especially  during  peak 
demand periods when both water supply and electric 
power capacities are stretched to their limits. 

Can Adaptation Plans Reach the Slums?

Although  planning  for  climate  change  is  crucial, 
there is plenty of evidence that most urbanization 
in developing countries takes place outside of any 
plan  or  oﬃcial  regulations.  The  reasons  include 
unaﬀordable housing in well-regulated areas, rural-
to-urban  and  transnational  migration,  and  the 

mismatch in institutional capacity to manage the 
growth of urban centers and economies. In Africa, 
Asia,  and  Latin  America,  hundreds  of  millions 
of people live in sub-par conditions, dealing with 
problems  such  as  overcrowding,  insecure  tenure 
and  inadequate  provision  of  water,  sanitation, 
health,  electricity,  and  other  services.  This  is 
particularly  true  in  informal  settlements,  which 
comprise  up  to  50  percent  of  the  urban  popula-
tions in some developing-country cities. 

Two factors limit a city’s capacity to address these 
issues.  First,  urban  governments  tend  to  have 
limited  human  and  ﬁscal  capacity;  ﬁnance  is 
usually controlled nationally, and even when cities 
produce most of the country’s GDP they are often 
dependent on higher levels of government for their 
resources.  Second,  urban  governments  tend  to 
have an antagonistic relationship with low-income 
groups,  particularly  informal  settlers,  who  are 
believed  to  hold  back  city  success  by  remaining 
outside the formal economic system.

The Cost of Adapting  
Housing and Slums 

Planned adaptation costs do not account for the high 
adaptation costs for urban housing, which are largely 
private.  The  World  Bank  estimated  annual  average 
household investments in urban housing in response 
to  climate  change  at  $2.3  billion  per  year  in  2010, 
rising to $25.6 billion per year by 2050. 

These  costs  would  be  even  higher  if  they  also 
accounted  for  slums.  Most  informal  settlements  in 
developing countries share characteristics that inten-
sify  the  vulnerability  of  their  residents  to  climate 
change.  These  include  poorly  constructed  buildings, 
inadequate infrastructure, lack of safe drinking water, 
drainage,  and  sanitation  services,  and  severe  over-
crowding  with  attendant  public  health  impacts.  In 
regions prone to ﬂooding, ﬂoods are more severe in 
sprawling urban spaces than in inland towns, in part 
because of weak urban planning. The growth of urban 
slums  increases  the  risk  of  climate-related  disas-
ters such as ﬂooding and landslides, in part because 
natural ecosystem-based storm breaks and rain catch-
ment areas are increasingly converted to public build-
ings and housing developments.

Cities will have to rethink their relationship with 
informality if they are to protect informal housing 
and  informal  economies  from  climate  impacts. 
Strategic land-use planning in urban areas can help 
prevent residential and industrial development in 
high-risk areas, but it can simultaneously increase 
the  cost  of  legal  housing  and  service  provision. 
This  limits  the  possibilities  for  low-  and  middle-
income households to rent or purchase adequate 
accommodations (Sattherthwaite et al. 2009). On 
top  of  that,  the  need  to  adapt  urban  homes  to 
climate change imposes further costs that are not 
usually counted in government plans (Box 33). 

Assessing Risks  
and Developing Resilience

As  cities  develop  tools  for  managing  climatic 
stresses and adapting to a changing environment, 
they become more resilient. The Stockholm Resil-
ience  Center  deﬁnes  resilience  as  the  capacity 
of  a  system  to  continually  change  and  adapt  yet 
remain within critical thresholds.13 Such resilience 
needs to be designed into policies for sustainable

72 BUILDING SUSTAINABILITY IN AN URBANIZING WORLD

management  of  social,  ecologic  and  economic 
systems (Levin et al. 1998; Derissen et al. 2009). 

Resilient  systems  have  the  capacity  to  absorb 
external shocks and continue to function by reorga-
nizing  and  adapting.  In  fact,  change  and  disrup-
tions  can  create  opportunities  for  development, 
innovation,  and  prosperity  in  a  resilient  system 
(Levin  et  al.  1998;  Holling  2001).  By  managing 
for  resilience  and  understanding  that  cities  are 
exposed to uncertainty rather than seeing them as 
static systems, we increase the likelihood that devel-
opment can be sustained under changing climatic 
and environmental conditions (Folke et al. 2002). 
As Holling and Walker14 put it, “a resilient socio-
ecological system is synonymous with a region [in 
this case, a city] that is ecologically, economically 
and socially sustainable.”

According  to  the  Resilience  Alliance,15  the  resil-
ience  of  urban  systems  is  in  part  determined  by 
metabolic ﬂows that sustain urban functions and 
societal  well-being  (see  Chapter  5  and  Figure 
19). Among the other essential considerations in 
building urban resilience are:

 (cid:96) governance networks and the support provided 

by government to its society;

 (cid:96) the  ability  of  a  society  to  learn,  adapt,  and 

reorganize to meet urban challenges;

 (cid:96) social dynamics between citizens as community 
members, users of services, and consumers; and

 (cid:96) society’s  relationship  to  the  built  environment, 
which determines urban form and spatial relations.

Adaptive  capacity  is  also  contingent  on  individual, 
household,  community,  or  institutional  resources 
(for example, income, asset base, knowledge, social 
networks, and eﬀective and climate-resilient service 
provision).  Particularly  in  urban  areas,  the  quality 
and  reach  of  public  infrastructure  and  service 
provision is key, especially for vulnerable populations 
(Sattherthwaite  et  al.  2009).  Hence,  resilient  cities 
are in essence urban areas that support sustainable 
income generation, good quality of service and infra-
structure provision, and access to health, education, 
and information systems. 

In  accordance  with  this,  the  Swedish  Environ-
mental  Advisory  Council17  argues  that  policies 
that manage for resilience will 

 (cid:96) stimulate  ﬂexible  and  open  institutions  that 

encourage learning; 

 (cid:96) provide  incentives  for  inclusion  and  cohesion 
among diﬀerent stakeholders and across sectors 
and disciplines;

 (cid:96) encourage  ecosystem-friendly  technology  and 
economic  incentives  that  enhance  resilience 
and adaptive capacity; 

17Ibid

 (cid:96) develop indicators for gradual change, as well as 
early  warning  systems  to  prevent  shifts  toward 
less desirable states; 

 (cid:96) acknowledge  uncertainty  and  expect 

the 

unexpected; and 

 (cid:96) strengthen the perception of humanity, nature, 

and economic systems as interdependent.

Other key measures to build resilience include

 (cid:96) urban  planning—for  example,  directing  future 
growth away from risk or rezoning existing areas;

 (cid:96) investing in infrastructure—for example, building 
sea-walls,  drainage  systems,  and  earthquake-
resistant construction;

 (cid:96) leveraging  ecosystem  services—for  example, 
managing coastal ecosystems to mitigate erosion 
and storm surges;

 (cid:96) fostering social resilience—for example, strength-
ening  community  awareness  and  coping  strat-
egies; and

 (cid:96) creating  insurance  mechanisms  to  manage 

both public and private ﬁnancial risks.

74 BUILDING SUSTAINABILITY IN AN URBANIZING WORLD

Ultimately,  assessments  of  urban  risk  are  the 
foundation  for  resilience  and  adaptation  action 
plans.  These  risk  assessments  and  action  plans 
should  be  developed  with  the  involvement  of  all 
relevant stakeholders. 

Urbanization  itself  is  sometimes  seen  as  a  driver 
of  climate-related  risk,  but  this  can  obscure  the 
underlying,  more  speciﬁc  risk  factors.  Urban 
planners  can  beneﬁt  from  deconstructing  the 
local causes and mechanisms of urbanization, and 
identifying  the  challenges  and  opportunities  to 
build resilience within the system (Sattherthwaite 
et al. 2009). They can ask what is leading residents 
and  industries  to  concentrate  in  high-risk  areas, 
and develop urban plans that address these factors 
to promote urban development in areas exposed to 
lower climate-related risk. 

Preliminary data exists on the risks cities are facing 
from climate change (Figure 17) as well as on the 

actions they are taking in response. While there is 
still a long way to go in data-driven and evidence-
based policy making, it is important to push these 
eﬀorts forward, because urban development initia-
tives that consider the impacts of climate change 
will be more durable in the long term. The next 
chapter looks at how sustainability and resilience 
could  be  better  measured  and  monitored  across 
the world’s cities.

Measuring Urban Sustainability

Key Messages
 (cid:96) Urban metabolism analyses look at how cities consume, produce and transform materials and 

energy. As measures of urban sustainability, these are more comprehensive and credible than a 
traditional ecological footprint. 

 (cid:96) Data sources for cities have been improving, and metabolism indicators are now being calculated 

regularly and rigorously. All cities should begin measuring material ﬂows and other environ-
mental and social data. The Large Urban Areas Compendium initiated by the World Bank aims to 
support this. 

 (cid:96) More standardized data enables cities to be compared in a typology. While requiring strong 
assumptions, this type of analysis sheds light on how cities are evolving in terms of their 
economic growth, urbanization and greenhouse gas emissions. Increasing wealth and urban-
ization usually lead to greater emissions, but some cities and countries have reversed the trend. 
Poor cities face a greater challenge in doing so, given their limited capacities.

 (cid:96) In addition to metrics for efﬁciency and environmental impacts, cities need a credible, 
standardized Urban Resilience Index. This would help focus attention on the urgency of 
mitigating risks from climate change in cities.

To assess a city’s sustainability, we need to consider 
how urban systems contribute positively to growth, 
prosperity, and social well-being, but also their level 
of “congestion costs” such as pollution, greenhouse 
gas  emissions,  and  overcrowding.  The  beneﬁts 
of  density  and  agglomeration  economies  need  to 
oﬀset the costs of congestion for the city to continue 
to grow. Quantifying these trade-oﬀs is not easy, but 
it is of great importance to policy makers. 

transform  resources.  We 

In  this  chapter  we  use  the  framework  of  urban 
metabolism  to  understand  how  cities  consume, 
produce  and 
then 
consider  how  to  select  indicators  to  evaluate  the 
sustainability  of  these  urban  processes.  As  part 
of  the  Sustainable  Cities  Partnership,  the  World 
Bank has begun a program to track key indicators 
in the world’s largest cities. 

Using  two  indicators—greenhouse  gas  emissions 
per  capita  and  GDP  per  capita—we  develop 

a  simple  typology  for  comparing  and  bench-
marking cities. Finally, we consider how to apply 
similar  metrics  to  assess  cities’  resilience  to 
climate change impacts. 

Urban Metabolism

The concept of urban metabolism—a means of 
analyzing a city’s resource needs and pollution 
problems—originated with Abel Wolman (1965). 
Wolman first applied the idea to a hypothetical 
U.S.  city  of  1  million  inhabitants,  analyzing 
the  flux  of  water,  food,  and  fuel  into  the  city 
and then out again in the form of sewage, solid 
refuse,  and  air  pollutants.  More  generally,  in 
the  field  of  “industrial  metabolism,”  the  flow 
of  materials  and  energy  through  a  chain  of 
extraction,  production,  use,  and  disposal  is 
assessed  in  order  to  measure  the  impacts  of 
anthropogenic  activity  on  the  environment 
(Fischer-Kowalski 1998). 

76 BUILDING SUSTAINABILITY IN AN URBANIZING WORLD

Today, the problems associated with these ﬂuxes 
are  even  more  widely  recognized  as  threats  to 
sustainable development. The framework of urban 
metabolism  can  be  used  to  measure  not  only 
environmental  impacts,  but  also  the  economic 
and  social  dimensions  of  sustainable  cities.  Data 
on  the  consumption  of  material  resources  and 
energy can indicate the eﬃciency and intensity of 
economic  production  and  the  potential  limits  to 
growth. When metabolism information is spatially 
disaggregated,  data  on  access  to  resources  and 
penetration  of  urban  services  can  be  used  as 
measures of social inclusion.

Research  in  this  ﬁeld  has  grown  in  the  last 
decade, with urban metabolism studies currently 
supported  by  the  European  Union  (Schremmer 
and  Stead  2009),  the  State  of  California  Energy 
Commission (2009), and the World Bank. Figure 
20 shows one example, discussed further in Annex 
8. Table 5 lists over 30 cities or regions for which 
urban  metabolism  studies  have  been  conducted 
in  some  form.  Some  of  these  have  focused  on 
particular substances, while others have been more 
comprehensive. The list would be much longer if 
it also included cities that have completed green-

house gas inventories, which entail collecting data 
on  the  energy  inputs  and  waste  outputs  of  cities 
(for  examples  of  these  cities,  see  Kennedy  et  al. 
2009). 

Urban  metabolism  studies  to  date  have  typically 
included ﬂuxes of energy, nutrients, and materials, 
as well as the urban hydrologic cycle (Schremmer 
and  Stead  2009).  In  the  broader  context  of 
economic,  environmental  and  social  sustain-
ability,  urban  metabolism  might  be  deﬁned  as 
the sum total of the technical and socioeconomic 
processes that occur in cities, resulting in growth, 
production of energy and goods, and elimination 
of waste (Kennedy, Cuddihy, and Engel-Yan 2007). 

Conversely, sustainable development, in the speciﬁc 
context  of  urban  metabolism,  can  be  deﬁned  as 
“development without increases in the throughput 
of  materials  and  energy  beyond  the  biosphere’s 
capacity  for  regeneration  and  waste  assimilation” 
(Goodland and Daly 1996). Hence, any city aiming 
to develop sustainably must be aware of its metab-
olism—the inputs, outputs, and changes in storage 
of  energy,  materials,  nutrients,  water,  and  wastes. 
Such  data  is  necessary  for  determining  a  city’s

greenhouse gas emissions, and it can also be used 
in  the  analysis  of  speciﬁc  issues  such  as  waste 
management  or  the  supply  of  water  and  other 
scarce resources. 

Measuring Inputs and Outputs

For  cities  that  are  serious  about  sustainability, 
quantiﬁcation of urban metabolism is becoming a 
mainstream activity, and there is a growing need for 
a comparable, standardized approach to measure 
inputs and outputs. Two recent developments may 
help to meet this need: a comprehensive scientiﬁc 
framework for urban metabolism, and a draft list 
of ideal urban metabolism parameters.

A  generic  urban  metabolism  framework  was 
developed at a workshop at MIT in January 2010 
attended  by  urban  industrial  ecology  researchers. 
The 
framework  comprehensively  captures  all 

biophysical  stocks  and  ﬂows  in  the  urban  metab-
olism  by  integrating  the  Eurostat  Material  Flow 
Analysis model with methods of energy, substance, 
and  water  ﬂow  analysis  (Figure  21).  The  system 
boundary  will  usually  correspond  to  the  political 
boundaries of a city, or to the amalgamation of city 
boundaries within a metropolitan region. It includes 
peri-urban  activities  such  as  food  production  and 
forestry,  where  applicable.  Furthermore,  natural 
components  of  urban  metabolism,  such  as  solar 
radiation  and  groundwater  ﬂuxes,  are  included 
together with anthropogenic stocks and ﬂows. 

Table 6 shows a draft list of the categories of urban 
metabolism  parameters  that  cities  should  ideally 
measure.  The  list  was  vetted  by  participants  at 
a  “Sustainable  Urban  Systems”  workshop  in 
June 2011, at the International Society of Indus-
trial  Ecology’s  Sixth  International  Conference 
in  Berkeley,  California.  Its  contents  reﬂect  the

urgency of pressing urban environmental issues, as 
well as knowledge of data availability and quality. 
Included  are  metabolism  parameters  required 
for accounting of both direct and indirect green-
house gas emissions. The list also includes metrics 
that address other issues, such local air pollution, 
waste  management,  sustainable  water  use,  and 
management of nutrients. 

Since cities together have such large global impacts, 
all large cities should begin collecting urban metab-
olism  data.  The  methodology  described  above  is 
robust, standardized, and practical enough that cities 
should be able to use it with relative ease. It is well 
anchored  in  academic  literature  and  complements 
related eﬀorts that cities are already undertaking. 

However,  collecting  data  at  the  city  level  can  be 
challenging  for  local  governments.  While  all  the 

parameters in Table 6 provide important parts of 
the  picture,  tracking  the  ﬂows  of  many  diﬀerent 
types  of  goods  and  materials  may  become  an 
overwhelming task, and some are more diﬃcult to 
measure  than  others.  To  establish  a  standard  set 
of urban metabolism measures and begin regular 
accounting  of  material  ﬂows,  cities  will  need  to 
become  more  proﬁcient  at  data  collection  and 
dissemination.  

Annex  7  shows  data  requirements  for  abbre-
viated  urban  metabolism  studies,  which  can  be 
undertaken  by  cities  with  limited  resources  or 
institutional  capacity  (Kennedy  and  Hoornweg 
2012). The spread of technologies such as Earth 
observation satellites may help to ﬁll in additional 
data  (Box  34).  It  is  also  useful  to  look  at  urban 
indicators  that  are  being  measured  in  some 
existing initiatives.

Satellite datasets are increasingly used to drive assess-
ment  and  analysis  of  spatial,  environmental  and 
temporal  patterns  of  urban  growth  (such  as  urban 
expansion, land use, and housing densities), and they 
are becoming a standard reference technology in urban 
indicator monitoring and evaluation. 

The  major  beneﬁt  of  Earth  observation  (EO)-based 
monitoring 
is  detailed  and  cost-effective  digital 

mapping,  which  ensures  that  decision  makers  and 
planners have the most up-to-date and accurate data 
available on land use and land cover. Historical EO data 
archives  also  enable  tracking  of  changes  over  time, 
providing insight into the evolution of urban agglom-
erations.  Earth  observation  facilitates  the  collection 
of  measurements  in  a  harmonized  and  standardized 
manner,  allowing  spatially  and  temporally  consistent 
global comparisons.

The  potential  uses  for  EO  are  many  and  varied, 
given  that  several  key  factors  affect  the  extent  and 
patterns of urban expansion: economic development, 
population growth, demand for housing, extension of 
transport networks, and so on.a Within an integrated 
geo-information environment, the spatial information 

can be combined with ancillary statistical, economic, 
and social data, allowing for more elaborate analysis. 
Examples are discussed in further detail in Annex 18.

Tracking Progress with City Indicators

Setting goals for improved urban performance or 
well-being has little purpose if there is no way to 
measure progress toward such targets. While there 
is as yet no consensus on how to deﬁne and measure 
urban  sustainability,  it  is  clear  that  in  rigorous 
metrics are needed. Along with urban metabolism, 
measurements could also focus important aspects 
of sustainability such as resilience, greenhouse gas 
emissions and energy intensity, provision of basic 
services, and social equity, among others. 

The  need  to  monitor  and  manage  city  goals  has 
led  to  a  proliferation  of  urban  indicator  systems 
of varying scope, size, and focus. Two of the most 
ambitious  are  ICLEI’s  STAR  Community  Index 
and  the  Global  City  Indicators  Facility  (GCIF),18
which  is  based  at  the  University  of  Toronto.  In 
addition, there are a number of other projects with 
similar aims: 

is  currently 

 (cid:96) STAR is “a strategic planning and performance 
management  system  [oﬀering]  local  govern-
ments  a  road  map  for  improving  community 
sustainability.”19  It 
in  devel-
opment  with  10  pilot  cities  and  counties.  It 
will eventually be linked to a set of consulting 
services  that  ICLEI  provides  its  member 
communities  to  help  them  deal  with  climate 
change, ﬁnancing, and other sustainability and 
operational challenges.

 (cid:96) The  GCIF  (Annex  3)  was  established  in  2007 
with  funding  support  from  the  World  Bank, 
based  on  a  standardized  set  of  indicators  that 
the  Bank  developed  to  build  globally  compa-
rable  information  on  cities.  The  GCIF  is  now 
supported by the Government of Ontario and a 
number of international agencies and corporate 
partners.  The  indicators  are  designed  to  make 

it  easier  for  cities  to  compare  and  share  infor-
mation about their operations and the well-being 
of their residents. With around 185 participants, 
the GCIF compiles Web-based datasets provided 
by its members through a standardized method-
ology using an established set of 115 metrics. Of 
these, 31 are “core” indicators, required from all 
members;  43  are  “supporting”  indicators  that 
all  cities  are  encouraged  to  collect;  and  41  are 
proﬁle  indicators,  basic  statistics  to  help  cities 
identify other peer cities for comparative learning. 
At  present,  while  the  GCIF  is  developing  and 
testing this initial set of indicators, only cities that 
contribute their data gain access to the collective 
datasets. The GCIF represents a unique resource 
for  measuring  cities’  progress  toward  sustain-
ability  and  other  performance  goals,  and  the 
indicators  are  now  undergoing  standardization 
by the International Organization for Standard-
ization (ISO).

 (cid:96) The OECD’s Metropolitan Regions database20
provides  a  range  of  socioeconomic  indicators 
for  OECD  metropolitan  regions, 
including 
population  density,  labor  force  characteristics, 
GDP  and  productivity  rates,  and  employment 
and  participation  rates.  To  contribute  to  the 
understanding of the eﬀects of urban dynamics 
on the environment and the well-being of urban 
residents,  the  OECD  is  currently  expanding 
its  metropolitan  database  to  include  a  small 
set  of  environmental  indicators  to  monitor  the 
environmental  performance  of  cities.  Given  the 
requirement  of  comparability,  the  OECD  has 
prioritized  indicators  that  can  be  derived  from 
global sources, notably data from remote sensing 
and geographic information systems (GIS) tools. 

 (cid:96) The  collaboration  between  C40  and  CDP 
Cities 
is  another  successful 
partnership  for  collecting  and  disseminating

standardized  greenhouse  gas  emissions  data 
and  related  climate  change  information  from 
cities.  C40  and  CDP  have  collaborated  to 
bring  annual  reporting—standard  practice  in 
the private sector—to city governments. CDP’s 
reporting  system  is  used  by  over  3,000  global 
organizations  to  make  their  climate  change-
related  data  available  to  the  marketplace, 
including 48 major cities. 

In  addition  to  these  comprehensive  indicator 
programs,  other  groups  are  promoting  more 
specialized  or  geographically  localized  urban 
metric systems. 

 (cid:96) The  Partnership  for  Urban  Risk  Reduction 
(PURR)21  is  a  collaboration  among  United 
Cities and Local Governments, the Earthquake 
and Megacities Initiative, Metropolis, CityNet, 
and  ICLEI,  designed  to  help  cities  prepare 
more  eﬀectively  for  natural  hazards  and 
disasters. While the primary goal is to provide 
information, they also propose an Urban Risk 
Index to quantify cities’ vulnerability. 

 (cid:96) With  more  of  an  emphasis  on  the  built 
environment,  Siemens’  Green  City  Indices 
(Annex  2)  have  now  been  released  for  several 
continents.  They  are  intended  to  facilitate 
learning  by  ranking  cities’  environmental 
performance. 

 (cid:96) Other  measurement  schemes  are  focused  on 
speciﬁc aspects of urban systems, such as energy 
eﬃciency, social cohesion, or public health, or 
on more restricted geographic ranges, such as 
one  region,  country,  or  metropolitan  area,  or 
diﬀerent parts of a single city.

These  initiatives  span  a  range  of  diverse  metrics 
and methods. Measuring city performance consis-
tently is surprisingly diﬃcult, and cities are a long 

way  from  agreement  on  a  common  approach.  A 
survey  of  eight  city  governments  in  North  and 
South  America  (Hoornweg  et  al.  2007)  found 
that each regularly tracked dozens to hundreds of 
indicators, but only two of the 1,100 total metrics 
were  common  to  all  eight  cities.22  The  way  in 
which  information  was  stored  and  analyzed  also 
varied widely. 

This is particularly a problem for investment strat-
egies  and  international  policies  intended  to  help 
cities  around  the  world  achieve  global  sustain-
ability goals. Such programs cannot be successful 
without having consistent urban data upon which 
to evaluate decisions. 

As  with  corporate-led  urban  initiatives,  data-
centric  programs  face  a  scaling  challenge.  They 
need to have a suﬃciently large user base so that 
other  cities  feel  compelled  to  join,  leading  to 
adoption  of  standard  methods.  Thus,  one  of  the 
central  questions  is  organizational—who  has  the 
authority  to  prioritize  among  non-standardized 
approaches,  and  how  can  the  growing  interest 
and enthusiasm for urban sustainability be more 
eﬀectively  stimulated  and  channeled?  The  Large 
Urban Areas Compendium—a new initiative from 
the World Bank, backed by the Sustainable Cities 
Partnership—is starting this process.

indicators  need 

Urban 
to  be  measured, 
standardized,  targeted,  and  compared  across 
cities  and  over  time.  The  Large  Urban  Areas 
Compendium  (Annex  10)  is  a  ﬁrst  step  toward 
identifying  what  data  should  be  collected  on  a 
regular basis, in order to focus policy making on 
underperforming  sectors.  Currently,  most  statis-
tical information is collected at the national level, 
whereas many relevant policy decisions are made

and  implemented  at  the  local  level.  Standard 
urban  indicators  should  be  designed  to  bridge 
the  gap  between  the  scale  at  which  information 
is  available  and  the  level  at  which  urban  devel-
opment is conducted. 

To  begin  addressing  this  gap,  the  World  Bank 
and partners such as the World Economic Forum 
and  the  World  Business  Council  for  Sustainable 
Development  (WBCSD)  will  assemble,  on  an 
annual basis, existing key data and indicators for 
the 100 largest urban areas in the world (Figure 22 
and Annex 9). With continuous updating of this 
compendium,  better  deﬁnition  and  data  quality 
for all key metrics should emerge. These data can 
also be used to develop typologies for comparing 
and analyzing cities at diﬀerent levels of sustain-
ability and development (see next section). 

The  Large  Urban  Areas  Compendium  will 
complement  and  extend  the  work  of  the  GCIF. 
GCIF is now ﬁnalizing an ISO-standard method-
ology for data collection, and GCIF member cities 

have  already  started  submitting  information  on 
many  urban  indicators,  but  many  have  not  yet 
released  their  data  publicly.  GCIF  selected  their 
indicators based on input from the partner cities, 
to  ensure  that  they  address  city  priorities,  infor-
mation  needs,  and  challenges.  The  indicators 
were  also  designed  to  be  “meaningful  to  cities 
across the globe regardless of geography, culture, 
aﬄuence,  size,  or  political  structure.”23  To 
minimize  duplication  of  eﬀorts  and  additional 
burdens  on  local  governments,  the  Large  Urban 
Areas Compendium draws heavily on the existing 
GCIF metrics. 

The set of indicators included in the compendium 
has  several  goals,  but  primarily  these  data  are 
intended  to  present  “vital  signs.”  They  should 
provide  a  snapshot  of  basic  city  functions  and 
amenities,  while  diagnosing  any  problems  and 
suggesting  possible  directions  for  improvement. 
In  addition,  some  of  the  indicators  were  chosen

to monitor progress toward the Millennium Devel-
opment Goals. 

Additional  indicators  deemed  necessary  for  the

following themes:

of the Largest Cities? 

There is currently no consensus on the borders of 
the 100 largest urban areas, almost all of which are 
metropolitan areas made up of several municipal-
ities. Sydney, for example, is made up of 38 local 
governments.a Internationally, the Lord Mayor of 
the City of Sydney may represent “Sydney,” but 
only 4 percent of the metropolitan population is 
electorally represented by the mayor.

Urban  areas  might  also  be  deﬁned  by  regional 
or  national  governments,  economic  hinterlands, 
commuter-sheds,  or  other  service  hinterlands 
such as employment or travel nodes. For most of 
the  truly  signiﬁcant  municipal  accomplishments 
in  urban  transportation,  energy  conservation, 
and solid waste disposal, metropolitan or regional 
approaches are necessary.

istics;

 (cid:96) economic data, such as GDP and the Gini coeﬃ-
cient of income distribution, which provides a 
measure of economic inequality in the area;

 (cid:96) energy  consumption,  energy  intensity  of  the 

economy, and electricity use;

 (cid:96) greenhouse gas emissions and intensity of the 

economy;

 (cid:96) urban  metabolism  indicators,  such  as  water

 (cid:96) measures of disaster risk, institutional capacity, 
and  vulnerability  (including  vulnerability  to 
the impacts of climate change);

 (cid:96) infrastructure inventories and need; and

 (cid:96) other health indicators.

The  initial  dataset  for  the  Large  Urban  Areas 
Compendium  is  published  in  Annex  10  of  this 
report.  This  is  the  ﬁrst  version  of  what  is  hoped 
to  be  an  annual  process.  The  samples  in  Annex 
10 represent the best data currently available, but 
they have signiﬁcant gaps and considerable ranges 
of  estimates,  particularly  for  the  greenhouse  gas 
emissions. Given the fundamental importance of 
cities and urban areas to the world’s economy and 
environment, such paucity of data is unacceptable. 

It is illustrative that there is no consensus even on 
what the world’s largest urban areas are or where 
their borders lie (see Box 35). Today there are better 
statistical  data,  for  example,  on  Fiji  (population: 
860,623)  than  there  are  for  Delhi,  Lagos,  Rio  de 
Janeiro,  or  Shanghai,  all  of  which  have  popula-
tions  in  excess  of  10  million.  For  future  annual 
compendia, organizations such as the GCIF, C40, 
Metropolis  and  national  governments,  as  well  as 

PART II: THE PATH TO SUSTAINABILITY 85

the  individual  urban  areas  and  their  constituent 
local governments, would be asked to move toward 
a  consensus  deﬁnition  of  at  least  the  100  largest 
urban areas of the world. For this inaugural eﬀort, 
the list of 100 largest urban areas is taken from the 
City Mayors Foundation.24

As  cities  improve  their  data  reporting  through 
programs  like  GCIF,  a  temporary  best  available 
data approach could be used to monitor the world’s 
100  largest  urban  areas.  This  data  would  not  be 
new, primary data, but would instead be a compi-
lation of what is being collected and published by 
cities,  agencies  and  higher  levels  of  government. 
Eventually a hierarchy of data credibility is likely to 
emerge—for example, city-reported data consistent 
with  ISO  standards  through  agencies  like  GCIF 
would be the gold standard, while estimated values 
such  as  those  for  greenhouse  gas  emissions  in 
Annex 10 are intended as placeholder values.

The  list  of  urban  areas  is  expected  to  change  as 
a  broader  consensus  emerges  on  borders  and, 
of  course,  as  populations  change.  Reﬁnement  is 
expected  during  the  next  several  years  as  GCIF 
develops an aggregation function for its member 
cities, and as national governments and city-based 
agencies reach broader consensus on the deﬁnition 
of  major  urban  areas.  For  the  foreseeable  future 
this  list  is  expected  to  be  published  in  several 
venues, such as the City Mayors Web site. Ideally, 
the  methodology  used  to  develop  the  list  will  be 
suﬃciently robust to enable ISO standardization.

The  hope  is  that  this  broad  set  of  indicators  will 
be made available by cities, updated annually, and 
shared through related publications and Web sites. In 
particular, changes in the indicators over time will be 
extremely relevant for public policy decision making. 
The next section oﬀers basic examples of the type of 
analysis that can be conducted using indicator data.  

24http://www.citymayors.com

Typology of the Largest Cities

Indicator data can be used to create a typology of 
cities, comparing them along various dimensions 
of sustainability and clustering cities with similar 
patterns. A typology can reveal relationships—for 
example, environmental burdens increasing along 
with wealth. It also identiﬁes “outliers” that defy 
these tradeoﬀs and do far better than most cities, 
and can suggest the reasons for such diﬀerences. 
In sum, a typology can identify core sustainability 
challenges  and  help  ﬁnd  ways  to  secure  people’s 
well-being while simultaneously taking advantage 
of  opportunities  to  decouple  urban  development 
from carbon- and resource-intensity. 

Underlying  this  methodology  is  the  assumption 
that  experiences  of  cities  at  more  aﬄuent  stages 
of economic development are useful to developing 
country  cities  as  they  follow—or  avoid—devel-
opment  paths  used  in  the  past.  Success  stories 
and  cautionary  tales  may  allow  developing  cities 
to take preventative measures or institute policies 
that will lead to lower-carbon development. 

With  this  in  mind,  a  typology  based  on  a  richer 
dataset  could  serve  as  a  baseline  for  planners  and 
the public to measure progress toward sustainability. 
Furthermore,  in  the  absence  of  binding  interna-
tional agreements around climate change, a typology 
could  motivate  smaller-scale  partnerships  among 
cities within the same cluster or type. Awareness of 
other cities within the same peer group can facilitate 
tailored  collaboration  and  action  on  certain  touch-
stone issues, and enable peer-to-peer learning.

Sophisticated typologies are challenging to build, 
however.  If  deﬁning  sustainability  based  on  a 
limited number of indicators is fraught with diﬃ-
culty, categorizing cities according to their level of 
sustainability is even more complicated. Cities are 
not easily clustered by income, production, density, 
or even pollution, as variables combine to produce 
complex eﬀects and categories are unclear.

86 BUILDING SUSTAINABILITY IN AN URBANIZING WORLD

These complications, however, should not hinder the 
exercise of clustering cities in pragmatic ways. Here 
this section proposes a relatively simple typology of 
cities. It situates cities along two dimensions: economic 
development, measured by GDP per capita; and one 
indicator  of  sustainability,  namely  greenhouse  gas 
emissions  per  capita.  Together,  these  two  measures 
show the greenhouse gas intensity of GDP growth, 
calculated as emissions/GDP. 

Of course, reduction of greenhouse gas intensity 
is  not  the  only  measure  of  urban  sustainability; 
sustainability is a wide and controversial concept, 
and  low-carbon  development  is  only  one  (albeit 

important)  component.  For  example,  sustain-
ability  could  be  equally  measured  by  water 
consumption  or  waste  disposal.  However,  green-
house  gas  emissions  are  more  closely  related  to 
global  warming.  Similarly,  in  this  preliminary 
work we have used GDP per capita as a proxy for 
well-being, but there are undoubtedly many other 
dimensions along which it must be measured.

In Figure 23, lists the 100 largest urban areas (based 
on  www.citymayors.com)  to  analyze  why  cities  at 
similar levels of development and income can exhibit 
diﬀerent levels of sustainability. This graph is based 
in part on estimated data, and thus it only roughly

indicates  the  relative  positions  of  cities.  Better 
clustering requires high quality, open data from city-
scale greenhouse gas emissions inventories. 

Nonetheless, the four city types approximated by 
the quadrants in Figure 23 already point to useful 
information.  In  particular,  cities  are  grouped 
according to (a) their level of income, as classiﬁed 
by  the  World  Bank;  and  (b)  whether  their  per 
capita emissions are within certain limits. Speciﬁ-
cally,  are  a  city’s  per  capita  emissions  below  the 
level  of  global  per  capita  emissions  according  to 
the  two  IPCC  scenariosof  450  or  550  parts  per 
million (p.p.m.) of carbon dioxide equivalent. 

The four categories are: 

 (cid:96) Quadrant I: Per capita emissions above the 550 
p.p.m.  scenario  and  far  above  the  450  p.p.m. 

scenario, and low or medium income (annual 
GDP per capita of $12,275 or less). 

 (cid:96) Quadrant  II:  Emissions  above  the  550  p.p.m. 

scenario and high income.

 (cid:96) Quadrant III: Emissions below the 550 p.p.m. 

scenario and high income. 

 (cid:96) Quadrant  IV:  Emissions  below  the  550  p.p.m. 
scenario, and even below the 450 p.p.m. scenario 
in many cases, with low to medium income. 

Quadrant  I  (lower  income  and  high  emissions) 
contains the three largest Chinese cities (Shanghai, 
Tianjin, and Beijing), with the fourth largest city, 
Chongqing,  only  slightly  below  the  550  p.p.m. 
line in Quadrant IV. Dhakal (2009) discusses the 
energy  use  and  increasing  carbon  emissions  of 
these  four  cities  (Figure  24)  and  the  underlying 

88 BUILDING SUSTAINABILITY IN AN URBANIZING WORLD

drivers and policy implications. Economic growth 
(particularly  in  the  industrial  sector  until  1990) 
was  found  to  be  the  dominant  driver  of  carbon 
emissions.  During  the  1985–2006  period,  Shang-
hai’s  economic  growth  was  signiﬁcantly  higher 
than that of the other cities, resulting in the rapid 
increase of carbon dioxide emissions. During the 
1990s, energy intensity (measured by greenhouse 
gas  per  output  GDP)  declined  as  the  economic 
structure  shifted  from  manufacturing  to  tertiary 
sectors.  This  decline  in  intensity  slowed  down 
in  the  2000s—becoming  negligible  in  the  cases 
of  Shanghai  and  Tianjin—and  absolute  levels  of 
emissions have continued to rise. 

Chongqing’s  substantially  lower  emissions  are  an 
artifact of its designation in 1997 as one of China’s four 
directly controlled municipalities, along with the other 
three  largest  cities  (Shanghai,  Tianjin,  and  Beijing). 
Though all four cities are overseen by a single Mayor, in 
the case of Chongqing the municipality’s jurisdiction 
was extended over 19 districts and 19 counties, giving 
it a land area larger than Taiwan. As such, the core city 
had a population of 5 million in 2011, but according to 
a 2010 article from the oﬃcial Xinhua News Agency,25
the municipality has a total population of 32.8 million, 
including  23.3  million  farmers.  Hence,  the  lower-
consumption lifestyle of the rural residents decreases 
the value of per capita emissions for the municipality 
as a whole, while obscuring the impacts of the higher-
intensity urbanized area. 

Quadrant  II  (high  income  and  high  emissions) 
is  dominated  by  the  cities  of  the  United  States, 
for  which  carbon  dioxide  emissions  from  road 
transport (cars and trucks) and residential buildings 
(electricity  and  other  fuels)  account  for  approxi-
mately  45  percent  of  national  carbon  dioxide 
emissions (Brown 2009). This is consistent with the 
trend of sprawling U.S. cities and the growth of peri-
urban and suburban communities with large, single-
family detached houses. To some extent, this is also 

25http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/china/2010-07/29/c_13420830.htm

true of greater London, which has a relatively low 
population density and large numbers of residents 
who live in the suburbs and commute to work. 

These developed cities are already above the level 
of per capita emissions that would lead to green-
house gas concentrations of 650 p.p.m., triggering 
global warming of more than 5 °C and irreversible 
ecological damage, according to predictions from 
the IPCC (Metz et al. 2007) and Stern (2010). 

In contrast, some other European cities in Quadrant 
II—  Madrid  and  Paris—have  denser  urban  form, 
smaller  multi-unit  housing,  and  more  extensive 
public transport networks, which reduces car depen-
dency. Accordingly, they fall lower in the quadrant, 
but still above the threshold for 550 p.p.m. 

Very  few  cities  can  be  found  in  the  high-income, 
low-greenhouse  gas  emissions  quadrant.  Quadrant 
III  includes  Buenos  Aires,  Mexico  City,  and  Porto 
Alegre.  Mexico  has  the  fourth  largest  installed 
geothermal capacity in the world, accounting for 3 
percent  of  the  total  generation  mix  (Geothermal 
Energy  Association  2010).  Mexico  City’s  Climate 
Action Program emphasizes eﬃcient urban transpor-
tation, with the installation of bus rapid transit lines, 
renewal of the taxi and microbus ﬂeets, construction 
of  bicycle  and  pedestrian  routes,  and  restriction  of 
days when automobiles can be operated. Barcelona is 
an extremely dense metropolitan area with a highly 
developed public transport system. 

Quadrant  IV  (low  emissions  and  low  income) 
contains  predominantly  middle-income  Southeast 
Asian,  South  Asian,  African  and  Latin  American 
cities. Geothermal power is a signiﬁcant contributor 
in  some  of  these  countries,  with  the  Philippines 
generating  27  percent  of  its  electricity  from 
geothermal sources (it is the world’s second largest 
producer  behind  the  United  States,  although 
geothermal  represents  only  0.3  percent  of  U.S. 
power  generation;  Holm  2010,  p.  7).  Geothermal

ances)  into  the  market  will  increase  as  household 
incomes  grow.  In  the  building  sector,  this  growth 
could  be  curtailed  by  the  adoption  of  low-energy 
designs that employ natural ventilation techniques. 
Vernacular,  pre-electricity  architecture  may  suggest 
culturally and environmentally appropriate building 
designs,  particularly  for  residential  structures.  In 
rapidly urbanizing cities, this may be an important 
way to lower the impact of the immense number of 
new housing units needed in the coming decades.

An  analysis  of  particular  cities  in  each  quadrant 
could  shed  more  light  on  what  is  behind  the 
diﬀerent  emissions  levels  in  the  four  quadrants. 
Greater pollution in some cities could be due to a 
larger manufacturing sector, urban sprawl, or the 
use of coal-based energy, for example. This kind of 
analysis could reveal the weight of each factor in 
explaining variations of greenhouse gas emissions.

generation in Indonesia, which is the third largest 
producer in the world. Hydropower is dominant in 
Brazil (86 percent of national generation) and repre-
sents 16 percent of the power mix in India. Both are 
among the top 10 largest hydroelectric producers in 
the world (REN21 2011).

Many Quadrant IV cities are growing rapidly, and 
as they continue to develop they are likely to move 
into Quadrant II unless policies prevent this. For 
example, car use is still much lower in Quadrant 
IV  cities  than  in  the  U.S.  cities  of  Quadrant  II. 
However,  sprawling  urban  growth,  coupled  with 
economic  growth,  will  encourage  private  car 
ownership.  Hence,  integrated  public  transport 
and land use planning is essential, especially when 
addressing service delivery and housing provision 
for informal and low-income settlements. 

Energy  use  in  housing  and  buildings  is  another 
factor in these cities’ emissions. Air conditioning is 
not  yet  widespread  even  amongst  the  middle-  and 
higher-income residents, and because the Quadrant 
IV cities have mostly tropical climates, heating is not 
necessary.  However,  as  with  private  automobiles,

at  similarly  high  levels  of  economic  development. 
Quadrant III in Figure 23 shows the lower-intensity 
cities  where  well-being  has  been  decoupled  from 
emissions. 

However, certain Quadrant II cities with high green-
house gas emissions and high GDP per capita also 
have  economies  with  low  greenhouse  gas  intensity 
(Figure 25). This can be explained by the fact that 
GDP  growth 
low-intensity  developed  cities 
far  outstrips  population  growth.  For  example,  in 
Chicago, New York, and Los Angeles, the ratios of 
GDP growth rate to population growth rate are 3.38, 
3.33,  and  2.67,  respectively.  London’s  GDP  growth 
rate is 105 times the rate of its population growth. 

in 

On the other hand, in the developing cities with high 
greenhouse gas intensity, the population growth is 
similar to or even greater than GDP growth in some 

cases. In Beijing, Shanghai, and Lagos, the ratio of 
GDP  growth  to  population  growth  is  1.01,  1.04, 
and  2.1,  respectively.  Kinshasa’s  GDP  is  growing 
only 81 percent as fast as its population. Hence, the 
discrepancy between high greenhouse gas intensity 
and low GDP per capita stems, at least in part, from 
the  fact  that  as  developing  city  economies  grow, 
their de-carbonization occurs more slowly than the 
rate at which their populations grow. 

Decoupling  urban  growth  from  emissions  may 
be  most  important  in  middle-income  countries. 
As noted above, Quadrant I contains several fast-
growing  middle-income  cities.  Figure  26  shows 
that  while  high-income  countries  account  for  70 
percent of the world’s GDP, they actually produce 
only  39  percent  of  the  world’s  greenhouse  gas 
emissions.  This  relationship  is  reversed  for  the 
upper-middle-income  countries,  which  account

emit 44 percent of total greenhouse gases. Greater 
carbon  eﬃciency  can  and  should  be  pursued  as 
these economies continue to grow. 

Figure  27  shows  another  simple  analysis  of 
urban  sustainability  based  on  a  diﬀerent  pair  of 
indicators—in  this  case,  the  per  capita  emissions 
of  countries  versus  their  level  of  urbanization. 
Some  interesting  patterns  appear;  Brazil,  for 
example, has the greatest rate of urbanization but 
relatively low emissions growth. Overall, the trend 
is consistent with previous analysis:: public policies 
play a large role in decreasing carbon intensity. 

Other  frameworks  can  also  be  used  to  under-
stand  diﬀerences  among  cities.  For  instance,  Bai 
and  Imura  (2000)  compare  East  Asian  cities  by 
describing  four  sequential  stages  in  the  evolving 
urban  environment:  the  poverty  stage,  the  indus-
trial  pollution  stage,  the  mass  consumption  stage, 
and the eco-city stage. The authors argue that for a 
particular city at a given time, environmental issues 
related to poverty, production or consumption gain 
dominance, until another group of issues becomes 
prominent in the succeeding stage of development. 
The  eco-city  stage  assumes  that  as  the  level  of 
economic  development  increases,  citizens  will 
adopt more resource-eﬃcient lifestyles and develop

greater  environmental  consciousness.  For  the  100 
urban areas that we have examined, this stage may 
be represented best by Quadrant III cities.

oping  world,  tools  designed  to  assess  environ-
mental quality should be expanded to measure how 
prepared these cities are for climate change. 

Analyses and categorizations such as these can be 
made more comprehensive and accurate as urban 
data  collection  becomes  more  institutionalized 
and more standardized. Given the wealth of infor-
mation  that  has  been  extracted  here  with  even 
an  extremely  limited  dataset,  the  Large  Urban 
Areas Compendium can be expected to contribute 
even more to eﬀorts at understanding the drivers 
of  sustainability  and  developing  a  broader  and 
deeper typology of sustainable cities.

While  the  consequences  of  climate  change  are 
increasingly evident in cities across the world, the 
process  of  assessing  and  forecasting  the  risks  for 
an  individual  urban  area  is  complex  and  accom-
panied by considerable uncertainty (Box 36). Box

Forecasting Climate Hazards

While  certain  types  of  hazards,  such  as  earth-
quakes,  can  be  forecasted  with  some  accuracy—at 
least  in  terms  of  location,  if  not  of  timing—others 
are  even  more  difﬁcult  to  forecast.  For  instance, 
sea-level  rise  occurs  at  different  rates  in  different 
parts  of  the  globe  and  is  highly  dependent  on, 
among  other  things,  how  much  and  how  fast  the 
Arctic and Greenland ice caps melt. The frequency 
and  intensity  of  high-precipitation  events,  which 
increasingly  are  triggering  devastating  ﬂoods  in 
many  cities,  can  be  predicted  from  global  climate 
models  via  downscaling  techniques,  but  generally 
with signiﬁcant uncertainty.

steps  would  also  specify  the  probabilistic  risk 
assessment  and  climate  change  downscaling 
techniques  to  be  applied.  When  such  a  metric  is 
established and widely adopted, it will help to focus 
the  attention  of  local,  national,  and  international 
policy makers on urban risks, presumably triggering 
more preemptive action and greater ﬁnancing. 

Urban risk and resilience are complex and multi-
dimensional, and it has proven extremely diﬃcult 
thus far to reduce these issues to a few indicators—
and, by extension, to an aggregate index that can 
provide a comprehensive assessment of resilience. 
One  major  eﬀort  by  the  World  Bank  to  address 
this gap has been the development of the Urban 
Risk Assessment methodology (Box 38). However, 
Urban  Risk  Assessment  is  an  approach  for  the 
detailed  speciﬁcation  of  where  and  how  many 

people  are  vulnerable  to  natural  hazards,  and 
identiﬁcation of susceptible urban infrastructure. 
It  does  not  generate  a  comparable,  standardized 
index that condenses the multiple dimensions of 
disaster and climate risk and resilience.

The Large Urban Areas Compendium presented 
above  will  contribute  to  the  development  of  a 
comprehensive urban resilience index. Eventually, 
robust analytics can be carried out to arrive at a 
typology of urban risk that would enable compar-
isons across diﬀerent cities. Such a typology would 
be useful in prioritizing the optimal types of inter-
ventions according to city type. However, as with 
typologies along the other dimensions of sustain-
ability, any initiative to develop an urban resilience 
typology  will  be  fruitful  only  if  data  is  collected 
and updated on a regular basis.

Which Cities are Most at Risk from Climate Change? 

Various in-depth studies over the past decade have assessed the climate-
related risks facing individual cities worldwide, and some global assess-
ments have provided overviews of urban risk across multiple cities. As 
each of these reviews uses a different methodology, the results are difﬁ-
cult to compare. In addition, some have focused on the risk to resident 
populations, others on the risk to economic assets. Nevertheless, to gain 
a broad idea of the cities most at risk, members of the Partnership for 
Sustainable  cities  compared  the  results  of  multiple  global  rankings  of 
cities (Annex 12), each conducted according to its own criteria. The top 
10 cities appearing in these rankings were: 

(cid:3)(cid:96) Dhaka

(cid:3)(cid:96) Beijing

While this list should be considered provisional for the methodological 
reasons just described, it can help focus the attention of local, national 
and international policy makers on the urgent need to address risks in 
these cities. In general the cities considered most at risk are located in 
Southeast Asia. Among the top 10, the only non-Asian city is Mexico City.

Urban Risk Assessment

To  date  the  predominant  response  to  disasters,  both 
within  city  governments  and  international  agencies, 
has  largely  been  reactive.  Given  the  signiﬁcant  impact 
that  natural  hazards  and  climate  change  will  have  on 
urban investments, increasing priority should be placed 
on proactive, adaptive planning to reduce and manage 
the potential for disasters and climate change. With this 
recognition,  the  value  of  identifying,  diagnosing  and 
mapping high risk areas is gaining visibility and impor-
tance. This has resulted in a proliferation of city risk and 
hazard  assessments  without  a  common  approach.  The 
Urban Risk Assessment (URA) seeks to strengthen coher-
ence  and  consensus,  minimize  duplicative  efforts,  and 
bring convergence to related work undertaken across the 
World Bank and key partner organizations. The objective 
is to move towards a common cost-effective approach for 
specifying  where  and  how  many  people  are  vulnerable 
to natural hazards, in addition to identifying susceptible 
infrastructure  that,  if  damaged,  would  have  knock-on 
detrimental effects on the urban population.

An ancillary objective of the URA is to better position 
cities to absorb and allocate discrete adaptation funds 
(should they be available). There are no direct linkages 
between  city  level  actions  and  National  Adaptation 

95

Programs of Action (NAPA), and no funding schemes 
in  place  to  ﬁnance  their  implementation.  When 
compared to other sectors such as forestry or agricul-
ture that have typically received sizeable allocations 
for  climate  adaptation  funding,  cities  have  lacked 
necessary mechanisms and tools to begin sustainably 
addressing climate change and disaster management.

The URA is based upon four principal building blocks 
to improve the understanding of urban risk: historical 
incidence  of  hazards,  geospatial  data,  institutional 
mapping,  and  community  participation.  The  URA 
is  structured  to  allow  ﬂexibility  in  how  it  is  applied, 
depending  on  available  resources  and  institutional 
capacity of a given city. Through a phased approach 
linked  to  complexity  and  required  investment,  city 
managers may select a series of subcomponents from 
each  building  block  that  individually  and  collectively 
enhance the understanding of urban risk.

The URA lays the groundwork for the deﬁnition of a 
plan  for  strategic  collaboration  across  city  govern-
ments, the private sector and development agencies 
to  begin  benchmarking  their  own  progress  towards 
the reduction of urban vulnerability.

96 BUILDING SUSTAINABILITY IN AN URBANIZING WORLD

What Should a Resilience Metric Include?

In order to be comprehensive, any urban resilience 
metric or index would primarily need to integrate 
natural  disaster  and  climate  risks.  It  needs  to 
recognize the full extent of certain climate impacts 
that  occur  over  large  areas  and  accumulate  over 
time. These can be in the form of large numbers 
of  widespread  but  localized  disasters  (associated 
with  sea  level  rise,  drought,  and  ﬂooding  due 
to  storm  surges,  for  example).  While  possibly 
accounting for only a small proportion of overall 
disaster  mortality  in  comparison  to  geophysical 
hazards  like  earthquakes,  extensive  climate  risks 
can signiﬁcantly damage housing and local infra-
structure,  particularly  in  low-income  commu-
nities.  Furthermore,  in  addition  to  the  hazards 
directly threatening a city, those that may aﬀect it 
indirectly—such as the future yield of rural water-
sheds  from  which  cities  draws  water  resources—
need to be part of the assessment of urban risk.

To present a complete picture of risk, an urban resil-
ience  index  must  address  the  exposure  of  both  the 
population and economic assets. Figure 28 shows the 
regional distribution of the number of hazard victims 
as  well  as  the  shares  of  economic  damages  (2000–

2010  average).  For  all  hazard  types  (climatological, 
geophysical,  hydrological,  and  meteorological),  the 
vast  majority  of  victims  were  in  Asia.  During  this 
period, Africa accounted for 15 percent of the victims 
of  climatological  hazards  (in  this  case,  drought). 
However,  across  all  types  of  hazards,  the  Americas 
sustained  the  largest  share  of  economic  damage, 
despite accounting for only 11 percent of the world’s 
victims of geophysical hazards and even lower propor-
tions for the other types. While this region has fewer 
people at risk, it has more economic assets. 

Assessment  of  exposure  to  hazards  will  involve 
detailed  data  describing  a  city’s  precise  elevation, 
geological  proﬁle,  air  quality,  the  hydrology  of 
natural waterways and drainage systems, ecosystems, 
the  location  and  characteristics  of  infrastructure, 
the  utility  systems,  and  the  spatial  distribution  of 
residential, commercial and productive areas. Such 
analytics,  generally  captured  in  the  form  of  GIS 
layers and maps, need to be accompanied by detailed 
assessments  of  the  vulnerability  of  city  assets.  For 
instance,  geological  micro-zoning  can  assess  which 
parts of the city are most exposed to earthquakes, but 
only the detailed analysis of the structural character-
istics of buildings in those zones will determine their 
vulnerability in case of an event.

PART II: THE PATH TO SUSTAINABILITY 97

Another 
important  component  of  urban  risk 
assessment that should be integrated in a standardized 
urban  risk  metric  is  the  economic  valuation  of 
potential damages and losses from projected natural 
disasters  and  climate  change  impacts.  Economic 
valuation  techniques  draw  from  environmental 
economics  and  cost-beneﬁt  analysis  methodologies 
to project the cumulative value over the assessment 
period, and calculate a net present value of the aggre-
gated amounts based on accepted discount rates. As 
the damages and losses can be attributed to speciﬁc 
vulnerabilities  and  risks,  the  costs  of  mitigation  or 
remedial  actions  can  be  calculated.  This  will  help 
policy makers understand which measures are most 
cost-eﬀective and will provide a return (in terms of 
avoided damages and losses) greater than their costs. 
However, as with urban resilience metrics in general, 
a standardized methodology for economic valuation 
has not yet been established.

Finally,  risk  management  mechanisms  have  to 
be assessed. This entails a review of the technical 
and  governance  measures  that  sub-national  or 
national  government  agencies  have  taken  or  can 
take  to  address  the  risks  identiﬁed  through  the 
previous steps. Such measures include setting up 
and  managing  early  warning  systems,  improving 
hazard  forecasting  capabilities  and  public  infor-
mation systems, educating and mobilizing citizens 
via  community  emergency  plans,  coordinating 
emergency  responses  across 
institutions,  and 
mobilizing  of  technical  and  ﬁnancial  capabilities 
for  urban  resilience  and  adaptation.  All  these 
contribute to the adaptive capacity of the city. 

While  scientiﬁc  analysis  can  measure  hazards, 
exposure  and  vulnerability  (albeit  with  various 
degrees  of  uncertainty),  the  adaptive  capacity  of  a 
given city and its institutions will be assessed mostly 
through  qualitative  evaluations  of  the  response 
mechanisms.  The  results  are  likely  to  be  based  on 
expert  judgment  rather  than  solely  on  data-driven 
indicators. There are, of course, established methods 
for  such  adaptive  capacity  assessments,  but  their 
conclusions  are  very  much  related  to  the  institu-

tional and cultural context in which they are carried 
out.  The  comparison  of  adaptive  capacity  across  a 
number of cities via a common metric raises method-
ological issues that have not yet been resolved. 

At  the  Partnership  Toward  Sustainable  Cities 
workshop  (June  2011),  70  representatives  from 
NGOs,  corporations,  government  agencies,  and 
universities described more than two dozen compar-
ative  urban  tools.  These  included  systems  for 
gathering and classifying data, indicators, indices and 
rating schemes, analytical frameworks for measuring 
urban  characteristics  and  impacts,  communication 
tools for presenting complex datasets and analyses, 
and funding and development strategies.

The Role of Institutions and Partnerships

PART III: THE ROLE OF INSTITUTIONS AND PARTNERSHIPS 99

Governance and Implementation

Key Messages 
 (cid:96) Strong institutions and partnerships among the public sector, private sector and civil society are 

needed in order to adopt multi-sectoral policies for sustainable, green urban growth. 

 (cid:96) Capacity-building in local governments and enabling policies at the national level are both 

important to support sustainable cities. 

 (cid:96) Public-private partnerships are opening the provision of public services to the private sector. 
However, the public authority must create the enabling policy environment and a regulatory 
framework that protects the interests of both citizens and investors.

 (cid:96) Transnational municipal networks allow cities around the world to collaborate on innovative 

approaches for urban sustainability. Agreements among cities can circumvent deadlocked inter-
national policy negotiations. 

 (cid:96) Civil society is emerging as a key stakeholder in implementing participatory processes in urban 
governance. At the same time, information and communications technology is opening vast new 
horizons for public participation. 

 (cid:96) Despite the existence of a wide array of options for making urban systems sustainable—but 

ideas, tools, and metrics do not create sustainable cities by themselves. The key to changing the 
situation on the ground is institutions and their interactions (see Box 39). 

Case Study: Institutions and Adaptation 
in Louisiana and the Netherlands

Louisiana  and  the  Netherlands  had  very  different 
reactions  to  local  rises  in  sea  level  during  the  20th 
century,  and  the  contrast  shows  the  importance  of 
institutions  in  adapting  to  the  impacts  of  climate 
change. In the case of Louisiana, risks were addressed 
ex post, with levees being reinforced only after disas-
ters  had  occurred.  In  the  Netherlands,  on  the  other 
hand,  the  Delta  Commission  institutionalized  risk 
management by reinforcing the seawalls on a regular 
basis, among other measures. Thus, the Netherlands’ 
successful strategy since 1953 is arguably due more to 
institutions like the Delta Commission than to physical 
protections such as seawalls.

100 BUILDING SUSTAINABILITY IN AN URBANIZING WORLD

These institutions can belong to the public sector 
(international agencies, bureaucratic line agencies, 
elected local government units), the private sector 
(businesses, developers, investors), or civil society 
(transnational  municipal  networks,  NGOs).  The 
issues facing cities span all these sectors, and multi-
sectoral  policies  are  needed.  For  such  policies  to 
be successful, cities have to embrace broad partici-
pation in decision making and use reliable institu-
tions or partnerships for implementation (Box 40).

For  example,  land  use,  urban  form,  and  urban 
planning  are  critical  to  transport-related  energy 
for  adaptation  planning. 
consumption  and 

However, institutions often have trouble carrying 
out  the  design  and  enforcement  of  urban  plans 
and can sometimes face resistance from citizens, 
which can only be dealt with through open and 
integrated  consultative  processes.  Institutional 
weaknesses,  such  as  inadequate  land  tenure, 
often  make  it  harder  to  implement  and  enforce 
strategic  land-use  plans.  Consequently,  the  ﬁrst 
step  in  the  design  of  sustainability  policies  is 
to  review  institutional  capacity,  identify  insti-
tutional  obstacles,  and  build  a  strategy  around 
these  limitations.  Below  the  roles  and  needs  of 
diﬀerent  types  of  institutions  are  considered  in 
urban sustainability initiatives. 

Governing the Twenty-First Century City

Whether in the developed or developing world, cities 
face  many  similar  challenges:  concentrations  of 
poverty  and  unemployment,  environmental  degra-
dation, lack of public safety, and political corruption 
are only some of the most signiﬁcant. In “Governing 
the  Twenty  First-Century  City,”  Fuchs  (2012)  argues 
that the most effective way to address these policy 
challenges  is  to  strengthen  urban  governance  and 
institutions. 

(cid:3)(cid:96) A  fair  governance  structure,  with  sufﬁcient  ﬁscal 
and  administrative  autonomy,  is  needed  to  efﬁ-
ciently  and  equitably  deliver  public  services  that 
support an environmentally sustainable economy.

clear  accountability  when  cities  (as  opposed  to 
national  or  state  governments)  are  the  entities 
that have a legal responsibility, ﬁscal capacity, and 
administrative authority to deliver public services.

(cid:3)(cid:96) Service  delivery  can  be  contracted  to  the  private 
sector or to NGOs, but the local government must 
still have the expertise and ﬁscal capacity to provide 
oversight and be accountable to civil society.

(cid:3)(cid:96) City  governments  must  have  the  capacity  and 
autonomy  to  build  partnerships  with  businesses, 
community  groups,  and  other  government  enti-
ties,  and  provide  incentives  that  promote  entre-
preneurship, encourage businesses to locate in the 
city, and drive job growth.

(cid:3)(cid:96) The  leadership  of  the  city  government  is  neces-
sary  for  the  clearly  linked,  systematic  long-term 
planning  required  for  infrastructure  investments, 
quality-of-life  initiatives,  ease  of  doing  business, 
and environmental sustainability.

(cid:3)(cid:96) A  clear  link  between  city  institutions  and  the 
delivery  of  public  services  ensures  the  legiti-
macy and authority of local government, thereby 
promoting security and public safety. 

(cid:3)(cid:96) Strong democratic institutions of local governance 
and  high  levels  of  political  participation  enable 

Local Government

through 

their  roles 

Local  governments  are  critical  to  urban  sustain-
ability 
in  development 
planning,  in  the  delivery  of  basic  social  services, 
and in energy supply and management, transport, 
land-use planning, and waste management. Local 
governments can fulﬁll these roles only if they have 
suﬃcient governance capacity. Bulkeley et al. (2011) 
list critical factors in building governance capacity, 
including  access  to  ﬁnancing,  municipal  compe-
tencies,  the  multi-level  governance  framework, 
and transnational networks. Data and expertise at 
the local level are also necessary to provide a base 
for  integrated,  multi-sectoral  planning—as  seen, 
for example, in New York City’s PlaNYC.26 

Knowledge and capacity related to urban sustain-
ability  may  be  institutionalized  in  special  units 
established  in  the  mayoral  oﬃce  (such  as  New 
York’s Oﬃce of Long-term Planning and Sustain-
ability), or in a special municipal agency (such as 
Curitiba’s planning agency, Instituto de Pesquisa e 
Planejamento Urbano da Curitiba27). These bodies 
are eﬀective because they are capable of providing 
high-level  technical  and  analytical 
inputs  to 
urban planning, they have long-term, continuous 
mandates and organizational structures, they are 
aﬀorded relative autonomy, and there are mecha-
nisms for public participation in the development 
and implementation of sustainability plans. 

Pro-poor  adaptation  to  the  impacts  of  climate 
change  is  one  area  where,  in  general,  city  and 
municipal  governments  need  greater  capacity. 
Improved  knowledge,  competence,  and  account-
ability  would increase the adaptive capacity of local 
bodies.  One  successful  example  is  Porto  Alegre, 
Brazil, where resilient urban development is evident 
in  environmental  and  social  programs,  coupled

with a strengthened local democracy and reduced 
anti-poor attitudes (Sattherthwaite et al. 2009). 

As discussed in Chapter 4, it can be particularly 
challenging  for  cities  to  address  climate-related 
risks  to  poor  and  vulnerable  populations.  These 
groups  tend  to  live  in  informal  settlements  with 
insecure land tenure and little urban infrastructure, 
and  work  in  the  informal  sector  with  no  safety 
nets.  Natural  disasters  compound  risk  to  these 
communities and can foster poverty traps. While 
land  tenure  and  informality  are  still  issues  cities 
grapple with globally, implementing policies that 
build resilience in low-income neighborhoods and 
slums help control the risk of disasters. Enacting 
these policies requires coordination among depart-
ments at the municipal level, and with civil society 
and private sector partners.

The  transition  toward  sustainable  cities  will  also 
require signiﬁcant investments, which means that 
new  institutions  and  ﬁnancial  instruments  will 
be needed. Many possible instruments have been 
discussed at the international, national, and even 
local scale. They include access to carbon ﬁnance 
and  carbon  markets  (Kamal-Chaoui  and  Robert 
2009), specialized climate or environmental funds, 
socially responsible investment (Labatt and White 
2007), or subsidized access to capital. In addition, 
the  worldwide  trend  of  government  decentral-
ization has given many cities more power to raise 
and manage their own revenues (Box 41). 

Because  of  limited  ﬁnancial  resources,  many 
municipalities  in  developing  countries  still  have 
diﬃculty  providing  even  basic  services,  particu-
larly to the urban poor. From both a political and 
budgetary standpoint, this can place a low priority 
on  investments  to  address  longer-term  sustain-
ability issues. The framework of green growth may 
convince  city  actors  to  see  sustainability  invest-
ments as an economic opportunity, but access to 
ﬁnancing will be crucial to this mainstreaming.

102 BUILDING SUSTAINABILITY IN AN URBANIZING WORLD

National Government

Innovations  at  the  city  level  require  appro-
priate  national  policies.  An  enabling  national 
policy environment allows cities to experiment 
and be creative. For example, London was able 
to  innovate  in  designing  and  implementing 
its  congestion  charge  because  the  national 
government  allowed  and  encouraged  such 
experimentation. 

The  role  of  cities  goes  beyond  the  cities 
themselves, given their importance to prosperity 
and growth. Urbanization increases in lock step 
with economic development, and the ability of 
cities to remain attractive and eﬃcient is crucial 
to  secure  and  sustain  national  growth.  Thus, 
national  governments  have  a  strong  economic 
interest in urban sustainability, and they should 

take  the  lead  on  the  coordinated  design  and 
implementation of enabling policy instruments. 
National leadership helps to harmonize diﬀerent 
goals and programs, and provides scalability so 
that  cities  can  exploit  the  most  cost-eﬀective 
opportunities. 

Public-Private Partnerships

To  move  toward  sustainability,  cities  must 
transform  the  processes  of  production  and 
consumption—and  businesses  are  often  at  the 
heart  of  these  processes  (Box  42).  Moreover, 
since  the  mid-1980s,  there  has  been  a  global 
trend of opening the provision of public services 
to  the  private  sector  (World  Bank  2004;  see 
Annex 14 for examples of pilot projects). These 
services are no longer seen only as public goods, 
but also as economic services. 

Decentralization of Governance 

 

1
4

B

In recent decades, many countries have decentralized 
their governments to a greater or lesser extent (World 
Bank 2008). Decentralization shifts authority, respon-
sibility, and accountability for public functions from the 
national government to local governments (Republic of 
the Philippines 1991). Hence, municipalities usually have 
the power to create and broaden their own sources of 
revenue,  in  addition  to  receiving  a  share  of  national 
revenues and proceeds from the utilization of natural 
resources within their jurisdiction. 

The  most  empowering  forms  of  decentraliza-
tion, however, provide the political space for local 
government  action.  They  also  allow  the  private 
sector  to  participate  in  local  governance,  partic-
ularly  in  the  delivery  of  basic  services  and  infra-

structure, as an alternative strategy for sustainable 
development.

With  decentralization  comes  a  transfer  of  authority 
for  planning,  ﬁnance,  and  management  to  units  of 
local  government.  Responsibilities  for  service  provi-
sion rest with local governments that raise their own 
revenues  and  have  independent  authority  to  make 
investment  decisions.  However,  in  many  developing-
country  municipalities,  the  tax  base  is  so  weak  that 
dependence  on  central  government  subsidies  still 
persists. For ﬁscally decentralized cities, authorization 
of  municipal  borrowing  is  emerging  as  an  important 
channel  through  which  cities  can  access  ﬁnancing 
for investments that contribute to their sustainability 
agenda (Kamal-Chaoui and Robert 2009). 

Vision 2050: The New Agenda for Business

The WBCSD’s Vision 2050 calls for a new agenda for busi-
ness  that  is  compatible  with  good  living  standards  and 
sustainable resource use. As part of the project, 29 global 
companies  mapped  the  changes  necessary  to  create 
a  sustainable  future.  The  outcome  was  the  result  of  18 
months of expert meetings, and dialogues with more than 
200 companies and stakeholders in 20 countries. 

The results of this work provide a strategic framework 
for navigating the many challenges ahead, along with a 
platform for dialogue for governments, businesses, and 
other  stakeholders.  One  of  the  conclusions  is  that  to 
achieve sustainability, the world will need to transform 
the processes of production and consumption and this 
will  require  building  complex  coalitions  among  stake-
holders in order to create new sustainable solutions. 

The must-haves (what society and corporations need 
to do) include incorporating the costs of externalities, 
starting with carbon, ecosystem services, and water; 
halting  deforestation  and  increasing  yields  from 
planted  forests;  halving  carbon  emissions  worldwide 
(based on 2005 levels) by 2050 through a shift to low-
carbon energy systems; and  improving demand-side 
energy  efﬁciency  and  providing  universal  access  to 
low-carbon mobility. At the same time, these changes 
will  offer  great  opportunities.  From  the  actions  to 
develop  and  maintain  low-carbon  and  zero-waste 
cities,  to  improving  biocapacity  and  ecosystems,  the 
business  potential  is  estimated  at  $3–10  trillion    per 
year (current dollars).

Telecommunications  has  garnered  the  most 
corporate interest, accounting for 53 percent of total 
investments with private sector participation from 
1990  to  2001.  Other  sectors  that  have  beneﬁted 
from private investment are energy (32 percent), 
transport  (18  percent),  and  water  (5  percent) 

(World  Bank  2001).  Today,  many  municipal 
services are operated by the private sector, in the 
form of public-private partnerships (Table 7). Even 
smaller services that used to be publicly controlled, 
such as markets and bus terminals, are now often

PART III: THE ROLE OF INSTITUTIONS AND PARTNERSHIPS 105

The  advantages  of  private  sector  provision  of 
public  services,  compared  to  publicly  owned 
utilities, can include the following: 

 (cid:96) Improved  management  efﬁciency:  Public 
administration  is  not  usually  guided  by  proﬁt-
ability and can have conﬂicting objectives—such 
as generating employment—that reduce economic 
eﬃciency. The private sector is driven by ﬁnancial 
results  and  is  committed  to  reducing  costs, 
increasing  bill  collection,  and  adjusting  prices 
for improved proﬁtability. In many examples of 
private  sector  provision,  billing  rates  increase 
signiﬁcantly. However, cost cutting may entail a 
risk of lower safety and security of supply.

 (cid:96) Extended and improved service provision: 
The entry of the private sector has also resulted 
in  better  service  quality—such  as  increased 
operation  time  and  better  reliability—and 
increased  access,  especially 
in  developing 
countries.  The  mobile  phone  market  took  oﬀ 
in Uganda after CelTel entered in 1995; access 
reached  15  percent  in  only  six  years.  In  the 
water and electricity sectors, the trend is similar. 
However,  privately  operated  service  does  not 
guarantee improved service, and in some cases 
the service quality actually decreases.

 (cid:96) Infrastructure ﬁnancing: The multiple systems 
of  urban 
infrastructure  require  high  capital 
investment and operating budgets that local govern-
ments alone cannot provide. Private investment is 
needed  to  complement  public  funding  of  infra-
structure.  Public-private  partnerships  such  as  the 
Chicago Infrastructure Trust (Box 43) can attract 
and  coordinate  this  ﬁnance.  In  regions  facing 
rapid  urbanization  and  very  large  infrastructure 
gaps,  such  partnerships  can  play  an  even  more 
critical role in ﬁnancing construction to meet the 
increasing demand. 

 (cid:96) Innovation:  Competition  for  private  partici-
pation  in  publics  services  and  the  prospect  of 

proﬁts have driven innovation in production and 
distribution  technologies  as  well  as  in  service 
management.  Kessides  (World  Bank  2004a) 
suggests  that  “decentralized,  market-oriented 
decision making freed from excessive regulation 
and energized by market incentives is the surest 
way to develop eﬃcient, innovative solutions to 
transportation  challenges.”  In  the  water  sector 
in South Africa, Durban Metro Water partnered 
with Generale des Eaux and Vivendi to design 
and  test  schemes  to  provide  free  water  to  the 
poorest,  as  mandated  by  law,  while  avoiding  a 
ﬁnancial burden on paying customers.

In  developing  countries,  the  private  sector  also 
supplies  public  services  that  local  authorities  fail 
to  deliver.  In  some  peri-urban  areas  (usually  poor 
neighborhoods),  small,  privately  owned  operators 
take  the  place  of  the  public  sector  and  operate 
essential services such as water supply or electricity. 
For example, in Cebu, the Philippines, 50 percent 
of the population receives water from independent 
suppliers who pump water from private wells. Those 
businesses may be run in an informal market when 
the regulatory framework is weak or inappropriate.

Where  public-private  partnerships  are  used  to 
provide services, private companies will be among 
the  key  institutions  for  adopting  eﬃcient  and 
low-carbon  systems.  In  the  ﬁeld  of  adaptation  to 
climate  change  as  well,  there  are  good  examples 
of  collaboration  between  cities  and  the  private 
sector.  In  Barranquilla,  Colombia,  for  instance, 
the company Sociedad Acueducto extended water 
and sewage services to reach 350,000 low-income 
inhabitants by issuing a long-term local currency 
bond of $63 million to reﬁnance its debt. In Kuala 
Lumpur,  Malaysia,  a  joint  venture  between  the 
Malaysian Mining Corporation Berhad, Gamuda 
Berhad,  and  the  government  to  develop  a  dual-
purpose  tunnel  that  carries  both  vehicular  traﬃc 
and  stormwater  has  reduced  adverse  economic 
impacts of traﬃc congestion and recurring ﬂoods

3Case Study: The Chicago Infrastructure Trust

The construction, operation, and renovation of infra-
structure  are  complex  and  costly  endeavors  that 
require  a  wide  array  of  stakeholders  to  contribute 
their  capital,  expertise,  and  particular  vision.  The 
budget constraints of many governments have added 
a further dimension of difﬁculty, in that cities can no 
longer  depend  upon  infrastructure  funding  streams 
from  higher  levels  of  government.  In  these  circum-
stances,  even  projects  with  high  payback  potential 
(for example, energy efﬁciency) are unlikely to be real-
ized  without  extensive  collaboration  between  public 
and  private  entities.  With  more  actors  representing 
various priorities and resources, however, it falls upon 
the city or metropolitan government to play the part 
of the maestro in the urban infrastructure orchestra. 

Alongside  economic  and  energy  savings,  co-beneﬁts 
and  well-being  improvements  should  be  targeted. 
For example, tax-increment ﬁnancing can be used to 
capture returns from investments in walkable, mixed-
use development. 

As  with  most  public-private  partnerships,  the  chal-
lenge for the city is to remain in control of the public 
realm.  In  2009,  a  75-year,  $1.2-billion  concession  of 
city  parking  meters  to  a  private  company  resulted 
in  a  bevy  of  criticism  against  rising  rates,  ﬁnes,  and 
the general disorder of the meters. More signiﬁcantly, 
the  city  lost  its  authority  to  manage  curbside  space 
and thus risks being unable to implement transporta-
tion projects if there is the possibility that they would 
negatively affect the private company’s parking meter 
revenues. In the long run, a demonstration of success 
by the Chicago Infrastructure Trust may prove to be a 
valuable input in the creation of a more programmatic 
approach to sustainable transport, water, and energy 
efﬁciency  projects  that  other  cities  can  follow.  The 
resources and experience of a given city government 
will be a key driver in ensuring that power and infor-
mation  asymmetries  between  the  public  and  private 
partners  do  not  endanger  the  delivery  of  public 
beneﬁt.

One promising example can be seen in Chicago Mayor 
Rahm Emmanuel’s recent creation of a public-private 
infrastructure bank—the Chicago Infrastructure Trust—
that will act as the centerpiece of the city’s ambitious 
$7.2  billion  infrastructure  plan.  The  plan  sets  out  an 
entire  sustainable  development  agenda,  and  the 
ﬁrst  challenge  to  be  tackled  by  the  trust  will  be  the 
$200–225 million city building retroﬁt effort, slated to 
reduce  energy  consumption  by  25  percent  and  save 
the city $20 million per year.

Five  of  the  world’s  leading  infrastructure  investors—
Citibank, Citi Infrastructure Investors, Macquarie, J.P. 
Morgan, and Ullico—have announced their intention to 
work with the trust. One of the ﬁrst steps for the ﬁve 
mayor-appointed  members  of  the  trust’s  governing 
board  will  be  the  establishment  of  a  clear  method-
ology for prioritizing projects. It is crucial that, in the 
initial  phases  of  the  program,  projects  be  assessed 
on a case-by-case basis. Chicago proposes that each 
deal in its trust be structured as a stand-alone limited 
liability corporation, thereby giving the particular char-
acteristics of each potential project a better chance of 
being taken into account, and minimizing the potential 
risk that typically accompanies a formulaic approach. 

Chicago  is  not  alone  in  this  endeavor.  Other  sub-
national  institutions  have  begun  to  study  how  they 
can  attract  private  dollars  for  public  projects.  The 
$233.4-billion  California  Public  Employees’  Retire-
ment  System  (CALPERS),  for  example,  is  sponsoring 
four infrastructure roundtables to explore how best to 
allocate assets in U.S. infrastructure projects. Around 
the  world,  municipalities  and  institutional  investors 
alike  will  be  watching  the  results  in  Chicago.  Done 
right,  the  Chicago  Infrastructure  Trust  will  not  only 
create  attractive  investment  opportunities,  but  will 
demonstrate that a sustainability focus is a wise down 
payment  towards  an  efﬁcient  and  equitable  urban 
future.

PART III: THE ROLE OF INSTITUTIONS AND PARTNERSHIPS 107

Public-private  partnerships  take  diﬀerent  forms 
according  to  the  level  of  private  sector  partici-
pation. Involvement ranges across a large span of 
functions such as capital investment, production, 
distribution  of  service,  maintenance,  billing, 
and so on. The most common types of contracts 
are  lease  agreements,  concessions,  licenses,  and 
build-operate-transfer  arrangements.  The  choice 
of contract should be carefully decided based on 
local  circumstances  to  avoid  possible  bottlenecks 
in service provision. 

In  these  partnerships,  the  public  authority  has 
an essential role in framing private sector partici-
pation, creating competition, and enforcing good 
management (see Box 43). Eﬀective regulation is 
the most critical condition for reform, protecting 
the 
investors  and 
consumers  (Asian  Development  Bank  2008).  An 
enabling policy environment that creates stability 
and mitigates the risks associated with investment 
is key to attracting private sector partners.

interests  of  both  private 

Multilateral Institutions, Municipal 
Networks, and Civil Society

International agencies have long recognized their 
mandate  to  provide  leadership  on  sustainability 
issues,  and  today  they  increasingly  understand 
the  importance  of  socially  inclusive,  competitive 
cities  that  oﬀer  good  well-being  (World  Bank 
2009).  Multilateral 
institutions  are  engaging 
with cities and providing tools and knowledge to 
deliver improved value for public spending, while 
promoting sustainable development. 

A good example of such a program is the European 
Union’s  Reference  Framework  for  Sustainable 
Cities  (RFSC).28  This  is  an  online,  operational 
toolkit  to  assist 
local  authorities  and  other 
bodies in improving the design and promotion of 
sustainable  development  strategies  and  projects. 

28http://www.eumayors.eu/news_en.html?id_news=436

Community-based  organizations  and  the  private 
sector can also use the RFSC as a resource when 
participating  in  urban  sustainability  planning 
and  programming.  The  RFSC  provides  a  multi-
purpose,  multi-stakeholder  decision  making 
and  communication  tool  with  a  broad  range  of 
questions that can help politicians, city managers, 
planners,  citizens,  businesses,  and  civil  society 
organizations  to  review  their  approaches  toward 
sustainability. Tools are also available to monitor 
implementation  and  to  evaluate  results.  The 
toolkit  is  open  and  ﬂexible,  and  can  be  adapted 
to  suit  various  political,  geographic,  economic, 
environmental, and social contexts. 

Also  notable  among  the  institutions  involved 
in  action  toward  sustainable  cities  are  transna-
tional  municipal  networks  such  as  C40,  ICLEI, 
Metropolis,  and  UCLG.  These  networks  are 
helping cities become more involved in the global 
climate change agenda and, more broadly, in the 
sustainability  agenda.  Networks  allow  for  the 
exchange  of  best  practices,  peer-to-peer  learning, 
and  collaborative  development  of 
innovative 
approaches toward sustainable cities. For example, 
in  the  absence  of  a  global  climate  agreement  at 
the national level, municipal networks often allow 
cities to enter into “shadow” agreements (such as 
the  Urban  Environmental  Accords,  described  in 
Box  44)  and  potentially  even  city-level  emissions 
trading schemes. 

At  the  national  and  local  levels,  the  rise  of  civil 
society  as  an  institutional  sector  should  not  be 
underestimated. It has provided a mechanism for 
individual  citizens  and  communities  to  collab-
orate  with  government  on  the  delivery  of  public 
goods  and  services,  and  advocate  for  account-
ability.  NGOs,  civil  society  organizations,  and 
community  organizations  can  strengthen  service 
provision  and 
environmental  management, 
improve  the  livelihoods  of  communities,  and 
even  contribute  to  urban  planning  (Box  45).  In 
many  cities,  civil  society  and  community-based 

108 BUILDING SUSTAINABILITY IN AN URBANIZING WORLD

disaster risk management have proven to be more 
successful  than  local  government  interventions 
for building resilience to climate change. A strong 
evidence base is key here, as a well-informed civil 
society will be better able to prepare and respond 
to extreme weather events. 

Civil society operates in the space where the private and 
public sectors fail to deliver services equitably. Urban 
sustainability will rely on governments and businesses 
empowering,  training,  and  partnering  with  the  civil 
society organizations that are ﬁlling these gaps. 

Participation in Urban Governance 

There is now a consensus that the quality of gover-
nance  depends  on  participation  and  account-
ability (ASEAN Studies Center 2010). While the 

participation of citizens alone does not necessarily 
guarantee better governance or service provision, 
it helps to link leaders with stakeholders, fostering 
a  shared  vision  and  understanding  of 
the 
necessary  tools  to  achieve  it.  History  and  local 
conditions inﬂuence the mechanisms and impact 
of participatory processes, but in all cases, gover-
nance  models  are  changing  from  traditionaltech-
nocratic  control  to  participatory  approaches  that 
rely increasingly on civil society and the business 
community (UN-Habitat 2010b). 

The process can be as simple as holding elections, 
consulting  with  grassroots  organizations,  or 
mobilizing their assistance. In the electoral sphere, 
a  deeper  modality  of  participation  includes  such 
tools as the ballot initiative, referenda, and recall 
elections. These are widespread in North America 

Reviving the Urban Environmental Accords

The  2011  UEA  Gwangju  Summit  was  attended  by  a 
total  of  822  mayors  and  representatives  from  114 
cities  worldwide,  as  well  as  experts  from  12  interna-
tional  organizations.  The  meeting  was  important  in 
gathering  city  representatives  and  introducing  the 
idea  of  an  Urban  Clean  Development  Mechanism 
(CDM). Major outcomes included the adoption of the 
“Gwangju Declaration,” which advocates for an Urban 
Environment Evaluation Index and an Urban CDM, the 
establishment of the “Global Low-Carbon Green City 
Award”  in  partnership  with  UNEP,  the  agreement  to 
hold a UEA Summit every other year, and the estab-
lishment  of  the  UEA  Secretariat  in  Gwangju.  Addi-
tionally, Urban CDM pilot testing will be conducted in 
qualiﬁed UEA signatory cities.

In  June  2005  in  San  Francisco,  52  city  mayors  from 
around the world gathered and signed the Urban Envi-
ronmental Accords (UEA), recognizing that “cities are 
the  main  culprit  of  environmental  degradation  and 
have  the  responsibility  and  authority  to  solve  conse-
quent problems.” They agreed to implement activities 
in  environment-related  sectors  (for  example,  energy 
and waste management) and to evaluate cities’ efforts 
and performance in 2012. 

While the UEA has 109 signatory cities worldwide, no 
governing council had been held since its founding in 
2005, nor has it been acknowledged as a UN-afﬁliated 
organization.  To  address  this,  the  City  of  Gwangju, 
Korea,  organized  the  2011  UEA  Gwangju  Summit. 
Gwangju  co-hosted  the  Summit  with  UNEP  and  the 
City and County of San Francisco. 

Case Study: Participatory City Planning in Chhattisgarh

The 1992 amendment of the Indian constitution (74th 
Constitutional  Amendment  Act)  provided  for  local 
government  devolution  and  vested  the  functions  of 
urban,  economic,  and  social  development  planning 
with local urban bodies. However, full devolution has 
been slow to take place due to a lack of corresponding 
ﬁscal devolution, an institutional framework for plan-
ning,  and  professional  staff  capacity.  As  a  result, 
most urban plans are still developed by the Town and 
Country  Planning  Organization  (a  national  govern-
ment  agency).  Furthermore,  there  has  been  limited 
participation in the planning processes by communi-
ties  and  civil  society  organizations.  Urban  planning 
has  remained  primarily  a  technical  expert-driven 
process, unrelated to the capacity of the local govern-
ment for implementation, and for which communities 
had no sense of ownership.

In recognition of this situation the Society for Partici-
patory  Research  in  Asia  (PRIA),  an  Indian  NGO, 
undertook  to  support  participatory  urban  planning 
in the state of Chhattisgarh, focusing particularly on 
addressing the needs of informal communities whose 
settlements  are  typically  not  reﬂected  in  city  plans. 
PRIA  and  its  partners  established  urban  resource 
centers  in  two  towns  (Rajnandgaon  and  Janjgir)  to 
advocate  for  the  needs  of  poor  groups  as  well  as 
engage with civil servants and politicians to support 
pro-poor, accountable governance. In the actual urban 
planning  process,  PRIA  conducted  several  rounds  of 
collaborative, multi-stakeholder consultation with the 
local government, during which (a) vision statements 
were  developed  for  each  city,  (b)  a  set  of  projects 
was identiﬁed and phased for implementation, (c) the 
projects were integrated into the municipal budget in 
order to ensure ﬁnancial viability without dependence 
on external resources, (d) area-speciﬁc urban design 
guidelines  were  prepared  for  informal  settlements, 
cultural heritage areas, and so on., (e) a process was 

109

created to review and modify the plan annually, and (f) 
the informal sector was actively engaged in the plan-
ning process.

Several  challenges  were  encountered  during  this 
process,  including  (a)  the  need  to  deal  with  urban 
departments  with  overlapping  functions,  (b)  the 
lack  of  legislation  to  enable  community  and  civil 
society collaboration, (c) the perception among local 
leaders  and  municipal  ofﬁcials  that  participatory 
planning  indicates  their  failure  and  is  a  challenge 
to  their  authority,  and  (d)  unrealistic  community 
expectations.

The  partnership  approach  that  was  initiated  and 
developed  by  PRIA  generated  demand-based 
plans  for  the  towns  of  Rajnandgaon  and  Janjgir, 
while  at  the  same  time  ensuring  feasibility  of  the 
projects  by  identifying  and  prioritizing  the  neces-
sary  resources.  Realistic  and  implementable  plans 
arose  because  projects  were  prioritized  and  then 
the urban plans were developed around these proj-
ects (as opposed to plans being the driver of project 
selection). In contrast to the alternative of state-led 
urban planning, the participatory process also built 
local government capacity and provided a clear link 
between  urban  planners  and  those  that  would  be 
responsible  for  implementation.  Notably,  capacity 
building was also undertaken to assist local bodies 
to  identify  and  raise  internal  revenue  to  fund  the 
planned projects.

The  ﬁnal  product  of  the  participatory  planning 
process was a phased implementation strategy, which 
included  (a)  an  investment  strategy,  (b)  the  role  of 
each partner in the short, medium, and long term, and 
(c) the project phasing strategy.

and  Japan,  and  are  spreading  into  Europe  and 
Latin America. Participatory budgeting is probably 
one of the most eﬀective ways to give citizens a say 
in how tax revenues are allocated, and experience 
with this process over more than two decades in 
Brazil  and  elsewhere  has  produced  important 

practical lessons. Clear guidelines may be needed 
on the legal and judicial frameworks that govern 
the  tools  for  participation.  And  as  more  data  is 
collected on performance and well-being in cities, 
this  information  must  be  readily  available  to  all 
stakeholders (see Box 46). 

Case Study: Filling the Information-Power Gap in Slums of Pune

India is home to almost 20 percent of the world’s slum 
population, and one-third of the world’s poor.a India’s 
urban population is set to double in the next 25 years 
to 600 million, and the slum population is expected to 
grow even faster. The country has advanced consider-
ably over the past two decades in its national policies 
and its intent to create more inclusive urban growth, 
but government programs still stumble at implemen-
tation  because  they  are  missing  the  planning  prac-
tices that would empower the urban poor themselves.

municipal  planning  purposes,  the  program  gives  the 
information about the community back to the volun-
teers.  CHF  International  has  trained  the  volunteers 
to  organize  community  meetings,  prioritize  their 
development  interests,  and  mobilize  community  and 
government resources to take action. 

To  date,  the  volunteers  have  collected  detailed 
surveys in 360 of Pune’s 477 slums, covering 86,000 
households (approximately 430,000 residents). Over 
a two-year period, 130 slums have participated in this 
“micro-planning” process, and all of them have mobi-
lized community improvements, both large and small, 
covering  physical  improvements,  social  issues,  and 
livelihoods.  The  surveyed  information  is  also  aggre-
gated into a GIS model within the local government to 
inform planning of service delivery.

This  program  demonstrates  a  powerful  model  for 
institutionalizing  more  inclusive  planning  in  slums 
and  empowering  slum  residents  to  create  change.  It 
also  embodies  some  of  the  emerging  concepts  and 
approaches  of  open  development,  which  the  World 
Bank has promoted—namely, more open governance; 
citizen engagement in development; collective action 
by citizens; the co-creation of development solutions; 
and  ﬁnally,  open  data,  open  knowledge,  and  open 
solutions (World Bank Institute 2011).

a.  The  World  Bank’s  latest  global  poverty  estimates  calculate  there  are  456  million 
people, or about 42% of the population, living below the new international poverty line 
of $1.25 per day in India. The number of Indian poor constitutes 33% of the global poor, 
which is estimated at 1.4 billion people. Moreover, India has 828 million people, or 75.6% 
of the population living below $2 per day; Sub-Saharan Africa, considered the world’s 
poorest region, is better off in this respect, with 72.2% of its population (551 million) 
people below the $2-per-day level (Chen and Ravallion 2008).

When  urban  development  policies  and  programs  plan 
for  the  poor  without  involving  them,  slum  residents 
continue to be marginalized and solutions crippled. Slum 
residents have long demonstrated their ability to orga-
nize, learn from others, contribute resources, and imple-
ment solutions. There are some exceptional examples of 
such initiatives in India that can serve as models for the 
country and region, for both state and non-state actors.

In  2008  CHF  International,  an  international  NGO, 
partnered  with  the  Pune  Municipal  Corporation 
in  India  to  implement  a  program  called  Utthan 
(meaning  “to  rise  from  the  bottom”  in  Hindi)  with 
support  from  the  Bill  and  Melinda  Gates  Founda-
tion. Utthan collects information on the physical and 
socioeconomic conditions of Pune’s urban slums and 
uses this information to empower both residents and 
local  government  ofﬁcials  to  undertake  community 
development projects. 

The Utthan program is distinct because data is being 
collected by an extensive network of over 1,000 volun-
teers  who  reside  in  the  slum  communities.  Rather 
than  simply  extracting  this  survey  information  for

Asia is the leading region in terms of mobile phone accessibility. Inexpensive phones are already available to 
some 1.75 billion people on the continent (about half the population) according to Business Monitor International. 
Third-generation (3G) mobile data service, which allows greater bandwidth for applications such as streaming 
video, is growing rapidly as well, with 200 million phones having come online as of 2010.

Participation through Information Technology  
and Social Media

The  availability  of  technology—especially  mobile 
telecommunications,  the  Internet,  and  social 
media—has  greatly  changed  the  possibilities  for 
citizen  participation  (Annex  13).  Mobile  phones 
are becoming more and more ubiquitous as their 
price continues to drop (Box 47), and the use of 
social media is likewise spreading rapidly. 

allows for mass collaboration by enabling many-to-
many connectivity on a scale we have never seen 
before.  Many  see  the  shift  toward  collaborative 
problem-solving  as  not  only  good  but  necessary 
for the complex challenges our societies face today. 
Nowhere  is  this  more  essential  than  in  eﬀorts 
toward  sustainable  cities,  which  require  not  just 
improved infrastructure and regulations, but also 
fundamental changes in behavior. Smart cities are 
of limited value without smart citizens. 

Unlike  traditional  media,  which  simply  provides 
a  channel  for  mass  dissemination,  social  media 

Large-scale collaboration is needed among govern-
ments, the private sector, academia, civil society,

on a Much Larger Scale 

Empowering  
Individuals

Enabling Real-Time  
Collective Intelligence 

(cid:3)(cid:96) Social media virtually  

eliminates communication 
and coordination costs, 
making it far easier to 
exchange information, to 
make group decisions on a 
large scale, and to integrate 
individual contributions into 
a collective solution. 

(cid:3)(cid:96) Technological progress has 
empowered individuals with 
the capacity to do what 
previously required large, 
well-resourced organiza-
tions. Podcasts, for instance, 
require no expensive broad-
casting licenses or profes-
sional studios—a laptop will 
do. In this newly ﬂattened 
world, meritocracy rules  
as institutional  
advantages erode.

(cid:3)(cid:96) Social media and the move 
towards “open data” enable 
stakeholders to share  
information with one 
another at unprecedented 
speed and scale. Indeed, 
mobile-equipped citizens 
can today complement vast 
arrays of digital sensors for 
real-time information ﬂows 
and full situational  
awareness.

and the public. Social media facilitates that collab-
oration by lowering costs, empowering individuals 
and  providing  access  to  unprecedented  amounts 
of information (Figure 30). As a result, collective 
action  is  increasingly  taking  the  form  of  self-
organized  networks  that  use  social  media  for 
peer-to-peer decision making in place of top-down 
leadership  and  coordination.  Governments  and 
international organizations are starting to adapt to 
this new reality by experimenting with new models 
that tap into these networks. 

At a more basic level, networked technologies are 
being  used  in  developing  countries  to  support 
traditional service provision and facilitate interac-
tions among citizens, governments and businesses. 
For  example,  Malaysia’s  Government  Multi-
purpose  Card  (MYKAD)  serves  as  a  common 
currency in electronic interactions at several levels 
of government (UN-Habitat 2010b), and India has 
recently supplied some 40 million tablets in rural 
areas to support education and health programs. 
A  recent  survey  in  India  suggests  that  even  in 
rural areas with particularly weak Internet service, 

citizens  express  a  willingness  to  pay  for  better 
e-government (Kalsi et al. 2009). 

Technology is also enabling greater participation 
and  accountability.  The  MapKibera.Org  project 
is  mapping  the  slum  settlement  of  Kibera  in 
Nairobi, using an online platform managed by a 
community  facility.  Incidents  like  crime  and  ﬁre 
can be reported, providing evidence for lobbying 
eﬀorts to address these issues. In the United States, 
several Web sites allow citizens to ﬁle complaints, 
share information, and communicate urban service 
deﬁciencies  such  as  power  outages  or  damaged 
facilities.  CityForward.Org  and  SeeClickFix.Org 
are two examples. 

In  developing  countries,  mobile  phones  are 
especially  important  for  empowering  citizens. 
Compared  to  Internet  sites,  phone  applica-
tions  can  have  the  same  or  similar  interactive 
features,  but  they  do  not  require  literacy.  Infor-
mation exchanged on mobile phones is generally 
anonymous,  making  them  a  potent  political 
mobilization  tool.  The  growth  of  mobile  phone

penetration  has  dramatically  increased  exchange 
between  citizens  and  transformed  the  arena  of 
political dialogue. 

Besides  messaging  and  community  mobili-
zation,  cameras  and  other  features  of  low-cost 
mobile phones open many new possibilities. One 
opportunity  is  the  surveillance  of  public  oﬃcials 
by  mobile  phone  camera  and  video.  The  term 
“sousveillance”  was  coined  by  Steve  Mann  to 
capture  the  citizen-initiated  reporting  of  wrong-
doing, as well as the idea of watching from below 
(Mann 2005). Many NGOs have developed survey 
instruments  based  on  open-source  software  that 
can be formatted and deployed on mobile phones. 
Epi-surveyor and Gatherdata start with a basic $40 
mobile phone, making use of text message-based 
systems  to  gather  and  analyze  real-time  data  on 
health  and  services  such  as  water  and  electricity 
(Datadyne 2011). 

Innovative governments have begun to use inter-
active communication channels to engage citizens 
and  organizations  as  partners  in  public  problem 
solving  (see,  for  instance,  http://www.challenge.
gov).  Governments  are  also  leveraging  social 
media to augment their capacity and improve their 
responsiveness  via  “crowdsourcing.”  Chicago’s 
new  Snow  Portal,  for  example,  enables  citizens 

to  claim  neighborhood  streets  for  community-
led snow removal, to volunteer for a Snow Corps 
that helps the disadvantaged, and to share shovels 
and  other  equipment  within  their  neighbor-
hoods. Companies, too, have begun to realize the 
beneﬁts of adopting a more open and collaborative 
approach,  as  they  increasingly  contribute  to  and 
launch  open  source  projects  and  move  toward 
consensus-based  standards  for  everything  from 
data to processes.

While these local applications of social media hold 
much promise, issues like climate change also call 
for collaboration at the global level across nations, 
cities,  corporations,  civil  organizations,  and 
ultimately  individuals.  Here,  too,  ICT  and  social 
media  have  a  critical  role  to  play  by  facilitating 
the  intensive  information  ﬂows  and  transparency 
needed  for  day-to-day  coordination,  knowledge 
sharing,  mutual  accountability,  and  trust.  And  if 
information networks are central for governance of 
sustainable development, they are equally important 
for sharing knowledge and encouraging innovation.

114 BUILDING SUSTAINABILITY IN AN URBANIZING WORLD

Learning and Innovation

Key Messages
 (cid:96) Cities have formed learning partnerships with other cities and with national governments. A next 

could be to take triangular international partnerships to the city level. 

 (cid:96) A number of private sector programs are targeting urban innovation. Cities are seen as 

important business clients as well as excellent vehicles to promote sustainability.

 (cid:96) In the academic community, the system of urban research and practice needs to be optimized so that 
academic groups can contribute to a larger whole, and have access to the necessary funding to do so. 

 (cid:96) Multilateral institutions are best placed to organize and coordinate stakeholders and their 

knowledge. The Urbanization Knowledge Platform, an experimental information hub convened by 
the World Bank, was a ﬁrst step in the process. 

There is no blueprint describing how to implement 
sustainable development in cities, and no one-size-
ﬁts-all solution. Successful approaches are always 
context-speciﬁc. Thus, it is crucial for cities to be 
able to innovate and experiment with new institu-
tions and policies. 

Improving markets, prices or incentives may give 
a boost to novel technologies, but cities also need 
to  learn  approaches  to  sustainable  development 
that  are  right  for  them—and  that  make  the  most 
of their resources. For instance, facing high risks 
from  coastal  ﬂoods,  developed  countries  with 
large budgets have innovated and invested signiﬁ-
cantly  in  structural  coastal  defenses.  With  more 
limited  resources,  Bangladesh  has  had  to  be 
innovative  with  early  warning  systems,  shelters, 
and  emergency  planning.  Given  such  diﬀering 
contexts, 
to  developing 
countries  will  sometimes  not  be  suﬃcient.  Cities 
should  focus  on  how  they  can  create  their  own 
responses  to  sustainability  issues  in  accordance 
with the resources available to them.

City-speciﬁc  knowledge  and  appropriate  policies

and civil society. Multilateral and academic insti-
tutions  also  have  important  roles  as  knowledge 
hubs and sources of specialized expertise. 

Governments 

City  governments  today  are  learning  from  their 
peers  across  the  world.  The  relatively  common 
sister-city eﬀorts are developing into more extensive 
and sustained partnerships among cities of various 
capacities  (Box  48).  As  discussed  in  Chapter  6, 
transnational  networks  of  cities  are  increasingly 
important  channels  for  learning  and  collective 
action.  At  the  same  time,  dynamic  partnerships 
between  cities  and  their  regional  and  national 
governments are becoming more frequent around 
the  world.  In  many  countries  cities  are  “growing 
up” and gaining a more forceful voice in national 
and international dialogues. 

Mutually  beneﬁcial  South-South,  South-north, 
and  North-North  partnerships  and  peer-to-peer 
learning  can  be  augmented  with  additional  ad 
hoc  and  permanent  partners.  These  “triangular 
partnerships” are already yielding beneﬁts at the 
country level (Figure 30), and moving to the city 
scale is likely the next phase.

Cities Learning from Cities

It is well-accepted that creative cities have the upper 
hand in promoting competitiveness, attracting busi-
ness  and  dealing  with  pollution.  Barcelona,  Bilbao, 
Curitiba,  and  Seattle  are  much-discussed  examples. 
Not only do they implement better policies, they also 
are role models in the way that they learn. 

Seattle,  for  instance,  is  a  good  “learning  city.”  City 
representatives  have  been  visiting  other  cities  since 
1993 to build relationships and capture best practices. 
Seattle’s Trade Development Alliance is committed to 
keeping the city at the cutting edge of urban practices, 
as well as establishing and maintaining relationships 
and promoting collective learning. This approach has 
been emulated by many other cities. 

Dozens  of  cities  have  sought  out  best  practices 
abroad.  Bilbao  launched  its  Guggenheim  Museum 
a  full  10  years  after  it  digested  lessons  about 
industrial  restructuring.  Lima, 
long  embattled 
over the role of private developers, saw in London 
the  impact  of  private  sector  partnerships.  There, 
public  authorities  had  created  clear-cut  arrange-
ments that guaranteed land and property rights in 
exchange for private investment in both private and 
public goods. That lesson helped Lima to deliberate 
over  large  infrastructure  projects  in  metropolitan 
development.

9 Businesses Beneﬁt from Sharing Information 
4
X
O
B

Campbell (2012) notes the importance of sharing 
and  displaying  private  sector 
information 
related to sustainability goals. More than 4,000 
companies  around  the  world,  including  400  of 
the  world’s  largest  500  companies,  disclose 
data  on  greenhouse  gas  emissions,  climate 
risks,  and  governance  to  the  Carbon  Disclosure 
Project launched in 2001 (CDP 2012). Reporting 
on climate change issues seems to be correlated 
with  corporate  success;  companies  with  the 
most complete disclosure and/or broadest action 
taken  on  climate  change  showed  total  returns 
about  twice  as  large  as  a  control  group  for  the 
period between January 2005 to May 2011. 

In addition to seeking knowledge, governments should 
set  policies  that  support  technological  innovation. 
According  to  the  OECD  (2011b),  the  most  appro-
priate type of policy instrument varies depending on 
the level of technology. In the case of promising but 
immature  technologies,  government  can  support 
research  and  demonstration  projects  and  determine 
which  infrastructure  and  regulatory  changes  are 
needed to promote deployment. For example, “micro-
grids”—small-scale smart grid systems—are now being 
integrated  in  new  ways  at  the  neighborhood  level. 
Several pilot programs, many with active involvement 
of local governments, have been established to help 
inform technology standards and determine whether 
regulatory reforms are needed. 

For  proven  technologies  that  are  ready  to  be 
deployed,  governments  may  provide  technology-
speciﬁc  support  mechanisms  to  help  jump-start 
the  market.  For  alternative  energy  technologies 

that have become locally cost-competitive but still 
lack market share, government can promote public 
acceptance.  For  example,  San  Francisco’s  online 
Solar Map has been instrumental in documenting 
the eﬃcacy of rooftop solar technology around the 
city (OECD 2011b).

Communities and Informal Networks

Informal  networks  or  “clouds  of  trust”  seem  to 
help cities learn at a deeper level. These are trusted 
links  among  key  actors  in  the  community  who 
have  a  stake  in  its  future.  Elected  leaders  come 
and  go,  but  business,  civic,  and  youth  leaders 
who  are  involved  in  ongoing  thinking  about  the 
city represent an important form of social capital. 
They not only bridge gaps in connectedness and 
reinforce  social  norms  (Burt,  R.  2001),  but  also 
provide  a  platform  for  learning  and  sustain  the 
threads of continuity in a place over time.

Knowledge City, Creative City, or Informational City?

Informational cities that are successful in developing 
ICT infrastructure, cognitive infrastructure and other 
amenities  essentially  become  global  cities  (Sassen 
2010). These are the cities that create or attract the 
businesses  of  the  knowledge  economy:  the  capital-
intensive  service  providers,  including  banks,  stock 
exchanges  and  insurance  companies;  the  knowl-
edge-intensive  high-tech  industries;  the  industrial 
companies  of  the  new  economy,  such  as  computer 
manufacturers,  software  developers,  and  telecom-
munications and Internet ﬁrms, as well as information 
service  providers;  and  creative  companies  ranging 
from architectural ﬁrms to advertising agencies. 

Achieving such economic success does not, however, 
make  a  city  sustainable.  Cities  participating  in  the 
knowledge  economy  will  grow  or  maintain  their 
wealth,  as  they  will  participate  in  the  ownership  of 
new assets (Kennedy 2011). But the mix of new knowl-
edge and creativity does not necessarily lead to green 
products or to environmentally sustainable cities. This 
depends  primarily  on  having  suitable  data  (such  as 
the urban indicators discussed in Chapter 5) and the 
political  will  and  leadership  to  make  green  growth  a 
primary policy goal.

Several overlapping labels are used to describe cities 
that  communicate  and  use  knowledge  in  a  sophisti-
cated  way.  There  are  smart  cities,  intelligent  cities, 
wired  cities,  creative  cities,  knowledge  cities,  infor-
mational  cities,  and  many  more  (see,  for  example, 
Hollands 2008). 

(cid:3)(cid:96) The knowledge city (or knowledge-based city) has 
generally  been  deﬁned  by  a  narrow  focus  on  the 
relationship  between  academic  institutions  and 
businesses in cities. 

(cid:3)(cid:96) The  creative city  enlarges  the  concept  to  include 
a  wider  set  of  creative  professions,  including  the 
artists,  architects,  other  designers,  and,  more 
broadly, cultural industries. 

(cid:3)(cid:96) The  smart  city  label  is  associated  with  use  of 
networked  infrastructure  and  ICT,  among  other 
attributes (see Chapter 3). 

(cid:3)(cid:96) Manuel  Cassels  (1989)  uses  the  concept  of  the 
informational  city,  which  combines  elements  of 
the  knowledge  city  and  the  creative  city.  The 
informational  city  has  three  key  elements  (Stock 
2011): 
for  communicating 
information  (including  connectivity);  cognitive 
infrastructure  for  transforming  information  into 
knowledge  (including  humans  and  facilities);  and 
infrastructure  other  than  ICT  that  provides  ﬁrst-
class leisure and retail opportunities.

launched in 2010 by the WBCSD to demonstrate 
how business can unlock opportunities and develop 
practical  solutions  toward  sustainable  cities  (Box

project work in areas such as water, electric utilities, 
and energy eﬃciency in buildings, along with many 
years of business expertise and experience working 
with  cities.  It  also  brings  in  the  best  available 
experts  from  14  global  companies.  The  UII  team 
then partners with selected cities around the world 
to  explore  and  identify  solutions  for  sustainable 
urbanization and urban infrastructure. 

corporations to explore the future of cities. Among 
the  companies  participating  in  the  Sustainable 
Cities Partnership, four of the most visible initia-
tives  are  Smarter  Cities  from  IBM,  Connected 
Urban  Development  from  Cisco,  Green  City 
Indices  from  Siemens,  and  the  Livable  Cities 
program from Philips.29

Private sector involvement is motivated by branding, 
sales, and philanthropy, and reﬂects the importance 
that the corporate world gives to cities. For example, 

The IBM-originated Urban Systems Collaborative

The  UII  is  an  integrated  approach  with  the  ability  to 
mobilize a wide range of expertise and competencies 
from participating companies. UII member companies 
include Acciona, Aecom, AGC, CEMEX, EDF, GDF Suez, 
Honda,  Nissan,  Philips,  Schneider  Electric,  Siemens, 
TNT,  Toyota,  and  UTC.  The  group’s  co-chairs  are 
CEMEX, GDF Suez, Siemens, and the WBCSD. Partici-
pating companies are sustainability pioneers who are 
aware  of  the  interconnected  nature  of  sustainable 
cities.  An  external  Assurance  Group  comprised  of 
six  prominent  experts  in  areas  such  as  housing  and 
development, urban design, and architecture reviews 
UII work, provides quality approval and feedback, and 
helps  the  team  in  its  reﬂections  on  how  to  proceed. 
Together,  the  team  handles  most  urban  issues  from 
waste to security, energy, water and sewage, buildings 
and housing, mobility, logistics, and health. They can 
also offer an end-to-end solution covering the entire 
life cycle of a city’s infrastructure. 

Each  UII  project  uses  a  systemic  approach  to  green 
urbanization and urban infrastructure, while providing 
strong  leadership  and  guidance.  UII  projects  begin 
with  the  identiﬁcation  of  cities  that  are  planning 
sustainability  projects  with  possible  sponsors  or 

ﬁnancers,  dialogue  with  city  ofﬁcials  to  understand 
their  vision  and  main  challenges,  determining  and 
prioritizing solutions to address the main issues, iden-
tifying tangible projects and measures, and involving 
the appropriate experts from the UII.

To date, the UII core team has worked with Philadel-
phia;  Surabaya,  Indonesia;  Tilburg,  the  Netherlands; 
Turku,  Finland;  and  four  cities  in  the  Indian  state  of 
Gujarat.  UII  will  also  work  with  cities  in  China  and 
Japan.  The  approaches  vary  across  cities.  Outputs 
include  advances 
in  biogas  production,  building 
automation  (cutting  energy  used  by  systems  such 
as  heating,  ventilation,  and  air  conditioning  through 
electronic communication among equipment),  energy 
performance  in  public  lighting  and  public  buildings, 
green logistics, and reducing congestion. 

The UII’s key lessons thus far are that (a) there is great 
value in involving business in the early stages of a city’s 
sustainability planning, (b) cities must also create the 
right  framework  conditions  and  incentives  to  attract 
the  necessary  investments,  and  (c)  multi-stakeholder 
expertise is essential to help transform cities’ sustain-
ability visions into effective and affordable plans.

IBM’s Smarter Cities program30 is part of a strategy 
to associate the company with capacity to generate 
system-level  solutions  to  complex  problems.  Once 
the  program  was  started,  IBM’s  business  and 
research  divisions  got  involved,  compiling  the 
company’s  many  city-based  consulting  contracts 
into  a  package  of  practice  that  could  be  studied, 
generalized, and replicated.

Cisco  Systems  has  an  internal  think  tank,  the 
Internet  Business  Solutions  Group 
(IBSG),31
charged  with  identifying  long-term  commercial 
opportunities for their core business of networking 
hardware and software. One of IBSG’s programs, 
Connected  Urban  Development  (CUD),32  began 
in  2006  through  collaboration  with  the  cities  of 
Amsterdam, San Francisco, and Seoul, as well as 
other  government  and  corporate  partners.  CUD 
created  Web  sites  called  Urban  EcoMaps33  that 
could educate city dwellers about ways to reduce 
their environmental impacts. 

the  CUD  program  expanded  with 

As 
the 
involvement of other cities, it gave rise to broader 
initiatives, 
including  Smart  and  Connected 
Communities, and Planetary Skin. In 2010, Cisco 
handed  the  leadership  of  CUD  to  Metropolis 
and  the  Climate  Group.  Like  IBM,  Cisco  has 
convened a series of international conferences to 
share the potential of these programs with leaders 
from development banks, scholars, and city- and 
environment-focused NGOs. 

While  IBM  and  Cisco  focus  on  information  ﬂows 
within  urban  systems,  Siemens’  core  business  is 
targeted to the creation and maintenance of urban 
infrastructure.  In  2011,  responding  to  the  growing 
interest  in  a  green  built  environment,  Siemens 
created a special division—Infrastructure and Cities—
pulling  together  many  of  its  city-related  oﬃces. 
Siemens  is  well  positioned  to  help  create  solutions 

for urban issues such as greenhouse gas reduction, 
cleaner  transportation  systems,  and  health  care 
delivery in cities of the developing world. Its Green 
City Indices (Annex 2) are among the urban data-
gathering programs reviewed in Chapter 5. 

Philips  has  also  chosen  a  focused  approach  in 
line  with  its  particular  strengths.  Its  Livable 
Cities program34 is centered on how lighting can 
inﬂuence  the  quality  of  city  life,  improve  public 
safety,  increase  energy  eﬃciency,  and  enhance 
mental health. Similarly, PricewaterhouseCoopers 
uses  its  accounting  expertise  to  lead  a  program 
that calculates the GDP of cities.35 

Other notable corporate partners include Alstom 
and  Veolia  Environment.  Alstom36  focuses  on 
urban energy and transport infrastructure and how 
ICT  can  help  to  optimize  eﬃciency  and  reduce 
carbon dioxide emissions (smart city technology is 
discussed in Chapter 3). The company has taken 
the  lead  in  the  ﬁrst  international  development 
program  for  carbon-neutral  eco-cities  and  runs 
dozens of pilot programs to test new technologies 
for smart cities, in partnership with local utilities. 
In 2010, Alstom formed a venture company named 
EMBIX with France’s Bouygues group to provide 
energy management services for eco-cities. 

Veolia  Environment37  focuses  on  urban  systems 
management. Their four divisions (water, energy, 
waste,  and  transportation)  cover  all  the  service 
needs of cities. Since the beginning of the decade, 
Veolia  has  pushed  a  systems  approach  to  urban 
sustainability and supported a number of research 
centers and collaborations dealing with such topics 
as city operations, human behavior, and attitudes. 

In  sum,  large  corporations  are  aware  that  cities 
are  important  clients  for  their  services  as  well

as  excellent  vehicles  to  promote  sustainability. 
Some of the initiatives may overlap,  and there is 
competition among consulting ﬁrms to advise city 
management. Although competition is healthy in 
principle, the development of parallel frameworks 
and indicators may result in dispersion of eﬀorts 
and  diﬃculty  in  comparing  performance.  Over 
time,  however,  there  will  likely  be  specialization, 
with  diﬀerent  ﬁrms  oﬀering  unique  products  in 
support of sustainable cities. 

Academia

Much  urban  innovation  to  date  has  come  from 
city  oﬃcials,  practicing  planners  and  architects, 
nonproﬁt foundations, and corporations that serve 
city  governments  and  citizens.  Conspicuously 
absent  from  this  list  are  university  scientists  and 
engineers.  This  minimal  role  can  be  attributed 
in part to the reward system of academia, which 
encourages  research  in  areas  that  receive  major 
federal funding. Because cities tend to fall through 

the  disciplinary  cracks,  faculty  interested  in 
addressing  urban  sustainability  problems  have 
not had many opportunities to obtain the largest 
and most prestigious grants from agencies like the 
European Science Foundation or the U.S. National 
Science Foundation, or from the most prominent 
private foundations.

Nonetheless,  the  growing  emphasis  on  sustain-
ability  in  colleges  and  universities  has  provided 
a context in which urban problems can be more 
widely  addressed.  An 
increasing  number  of 
universities have cross-cutting sustainability initia-
tives that can help quantify the economic, environ-
mental, and social impacts of cities. In particular, 
ways to measure urban metabolism (see Chapter 
5) and carbon footprints were developed in univer-
sities and then moved into practice among cities. 
Some  academic  institutions  have  been  able  to 
apply  more  specialized  expertise—from  space 
ﬂight  to  climate  modeling—to  help  cities  address 
sustainability issues (Box 52). 

Channeling Specialized Expertise in Academia

There  are  many  examples  of  how  universities 
exploit  unusual  expertise  to  advance  their  urban 
agendas.  MIT’s  SENSEable  City  Laba  and  the  Centre 
for  Advanced  Spatial  Analysis  at  University  College 
Londonb have been pioneers in the use of cell-phone 
positional  information  and  social  media  trafﬁc  to 
make complex urban dynamics more tangible. These 
groups are emerging as the preferred academic part-
ners for many cities and companies seeking to exploit 
these new technological approaches. 

Arizona State University’s Mars Space Flight Facilityc 
has been designing and controlling instruments that 
map Mars and other planetary bodies for more than 
25  years.  Over  the  past  decade,  they  have  turned 
their unique expertise in remote sensing and global-
scale  data  management  toward  the  monitoring  and 
modeling  of  cities.  With  NASA  funding,  corporate 

aerospace  partnerships,  and  a  collaborative  history 
with Google, they are developing an urban information 
system  called  J-Earth,  which  will  allow  virtually  any 
type  of  urban  data  to  be  combined,  co-registered, 
searched, and analyzed. 

Finally, in London, the multi-university Tyndall Centre 
for  Climate  Impact  Research  has  worked  unusu-
ally closely with city ofﬁcials to analyze how climate 
change  may  affect  different  aspects  of  the  city’s 
habitability, ranging from ﬂooding to the urban heat-
island effect to trafﬁc congestion.d The Tyndall London 
methodology is now being considered for adoption by 
other cities.

PART III: THE ROLE OF INSTITUTIONS AND PARTNERSHIPS

121

Urban  universities  that  see  the  improvement  of 
their local environments as part of their training, 
research, and service missions are best positioned 
to partner with government agencies and oﬃcials. 
Such  collaborations  are  becoming  increasingly 
common, especially as municipal budgets continue 
to be cut. One good example is the Future Cities 
Centre38 being developed in London by a group of 
universities  and  private  sector  entities,  including 
University College London, Cisco, and Arup. 

Chicago  and  Portland  oﬀer  similar  examples. 
The  University  of  Illinois–Chicago  established 
the  Great  Cities  Institute  (GCI)39  in  1993  as  a 
focal  point  for  studies  of  Chicago  that  also  have 
relevance to other major cities around the world. 
In  its  nearly  20  years  of  existence,  the  GCI  has 
partnered  with  several  hundred  local,  regional, 
national,  and  global  private  and  public  sector 
organizations. In conjunction with strong mayoral 
and  corporate  leadership,  the  GCI  has  helped 
place  Chicago  at  the  forefront  of  cities  coordi-
nating  innovative  policy  thinking  and  action. 
Portland State University40,41 has worked with the 
City of Portland, the Metro Regional Government, 
and  local  and  state  agencies  to  bring  the  green 
urban  innovations  for  which  their  region  is  well 
known to other cities across the United States, with 
the assistance of other members of the Coalition of 
Urban-Serving Universities.42 

As with competing corporations, universities tend 
to have diﬃculty sharing the limelight with each 
other, especially when reputation and funding are 
at stake. Schools that establish partnerships with 
individual cities, foundations, or companies prefer 
not to give up or share those exclusive pipelines, 
and  competition  for  large  grants  is  always  ﬁerce. 
Hence,  optimizing  the  system  of  urban  research

and  practice  so  that  each  academic  group  can 
contribute  to  a  larger  whole,  rather  than  trying 
to  replicate  what  others  are  doing,  requires  an 
unusual level of cooperation. 

Two  circumstances  could  foster  a  system  of 
academic  collaboration.  If  a  globally  oriented 
network  initiative  were  to  become  ﬁrmly  estab-
lished  and  funded—for  example,  ICLEI’s  STAR 
index—each urban-oriented university could team 
up with its local municipal partner to assure that 
their  city  has  a  prominent  role  in  the  collective 
enterprise.  Second,  if  a  university  has  a  widely 
acknowledged  and  uniquely  valued  asset,  others 
might  be  more  willing  to  include  them  in  any 
potential consortia.

In more traditional scientiﬁc disciplines, the estab-
lishment  of  major  centers,  institutes,  or  facilities 
through  concentrated  government  funding  has 
provided the kind of focus that has in turn allowed 
a  more  collaborative  community  to  emerge.  No 
such  academically  based  initiative  has  yet  been 
created  in  the  United  States.  Large-scale  (over 
$2 million per year) funding of an urban-focused 
Science  and  Technology  Center  or  Engineering 
Research  Center  by  the  U.S.  National  Science 
Foundation could have such a catalyzing eﬀect.

The Development Community

A  fundamental  diﬃculty  associated  with  coordi-
nating the diﬀerent types of urban information and 
programs outlined above is the lack of an obvious 
organization  that  has  the  necessary  authority 
and resources to forge consensus. The budgets of 
virtually all the world’s city governments are being 
tightly  squeezed.  Academic  researchers,  at  least 
in  the  United  States,  have  been  unsuccessful  in 
convincing funding agencies that cities are worth 
major 
investments.  Although  many  cash-rich 
corporations  express  interest  in  promoting  the 
understanding of cities, they have generally been 
unwilling to commit their funds to urban research 

122 BUILDING SUSTAINABILITY IN AN URBANIZING WORLD

programs  that  mostly  beneﬁt  the  public  rather 
than  their  companies’  share  value.  Some  smaller 
philanthropic foundations have begun to support 
urban  research  programs,  but  only  at  modest 
funding levels. 

Arguably  the  only  relevant  players  that  have  a 
global reach and maintain access to sizeable pools 
of  capital  are  multilateral  development  banks 
(MDBs) such as the World Bank, Inter-American 
Development  Bank,  and  Asian  Development 
Bank,  and  branches  of  the  United  Nations  such 
as  UN-Habitat  and  UNESCO.  These  organiza-
tions  have  a  history  of  working  collaboratively 
to  promote  regional  socioeconomic  objectives, 
including  infrastructure  development  and  insti-
tution-building. 

Some  examples  of  successful  collaboration  eﬀorts 
among  partners  which  have  yielded  useful  tools 
and platforms for city learning include the Global 
Protocol for City and Community GHG Accounting 
(GPC)  and  the  Knowledge  Centre  on  Cities  and 
Climate  Change.  The  GPC  was  developed  by 
ICLEI,  C40,  WRI,  the  World  Bank,  UN-Habitat 
and  UNEP  to  serve  as  the  global  framework  for 
accounting and reporting city and community-scale 
GHG emissions43. The GPC is expected to help cities 
and communities measure their GHG emissions to 
ensure  that  all  emissions  are  being  accounted  for 
between  diﬀerent  government  municipalities.  The 
Knowledge Centre on Cities and Climate Change 
(K4C) is the product of a Joint Work Programme 
between  UNEP,  Cities  Alliance,  UN-Habitat  and 
the World Bank44. The K4C is a platform for sharing 
experiences and best practices, as well as facilitating 
exchange of innovative initiatives. It provides access 
to hundreds of publications and reports which are 
mapped to speciﬁc cities, countries and regions. 

43   http://www.ghgprotocol.org/city-accounting
44  http://www.citiesandclimatechange.org/

The  diﬃculty  in  getting  the  support  of  MDBs 
or  the  UN  for  urban  initiatives  is  that  they  have 
tended  to  focus  on  countries  or  regions  rather 
than  cities  or  metropolitan  areas.  Yet  in  the 
past  few  years  the  banks  have  been  showing  a 
growing recognition of the need for more urban-
scale  actions.  They  also  have  the  credibility  and 
convening authority that most members of other 
sectors lack. A consortium of development banks 
could bring together representatives from federal, 
state,  and  municipal  governments,  corporations, 
NGOs, philanthropies, and universities to design a 
grand scheme for urban information management 
and  policy  creation  in  support  of  global  sustain-
ability  objectives.  Workshops  on  urban  issues 
have  already  spawned  a  multitude  of  knowledge 
networks and follow-up initiatives, but these have 
gained  little  traction  in  the  absence  of  central 
coordination (Box 53).

Organizing Information from Urban Conferences

123

Interest  in  tools  and  data  ﬂows  for  urban  sustain-
ability  continues  to  expand  rapidly  among  govern-
ment, academic, corporate, and NGO players. In fact, 
the  proliferation  of  well-intentioned  urban  solutions, 
workshops, and strategic plans from all these sectors 
is  becoming  an  unanticipated  threat  to  achieving 
sustainability  goals—nobody  can  keep  track  of  all  of 
them,  let  alone  determine  how  they  might  be  best 
integrated.

New  meetings  commonly  propose  new  knowledge 
hubs.  For  example,  the  Urban  Systems  Collaborative 
(USC)  is  an  ad  hoc  initiative  that  grew  out  of  an 
IBM-sponsored symposium on “Smarter Cities” held in 
New York City in May 2011. The USC started as a series 
of bi-weekly conference calls with 20–40 participants, 
and  then  evolved  to  include  speciﬁc  projects  such 
as  a  student  competition,  a  Web-based  reference 
repository,  and  a  series  of  webinars.  Contributors 

were encouraged to invite others to join, interact on 
a dedicated wiki, and propose new components. There 
was no identiﬁed funding source, and labor to set up 
the constituent programs was voluntary. 

Hundreds  of  other  large  and  small  urban-themed 
conferences in recent years have compiled presenta-
tion materials online, set up informal networks among 
participants,  and  proposed  the  creation  of  follow-on 
urban initiatives. The majority of these efforts become 
dead ends, largely unreferenced and forgotten, even 
by  the  conveners.  Clearly,  there  is  a  pressing  need 
to  establish  some  sort  of  clearinghouse  for  confer-
ences on cities and the products they generate. This 
requires identiﬁcation and screening by some organi-
zation, confederation, or Web site, and willingness on 
the part of the community to coordinate and reduce 
the number of meetings they hold.

Next Steps Toward Sustainable Cities

In just 40 years cities will need to build the infra-
structure  for  an  additional  2.7  billion  people 
(Annex 1). As we have seen, power, water, waste, 
and transportation systems need to be created, as 
well as local economies, governance systems, and 
jobs.  This  city-building  task  is  enormous.  Never 
has humanity faced as large a challenge, especially 
since  many  natural  ecosystems  are  already  well 
beyond  the  sustainable  carrying  capacity  of 
today’s  3.5  billion  urban  residents.  Sustainably 
building and managing new cities and retroﬁtting 
existing  urban  areas  are  imperative.  There  are  a 
only  a  few  decades  to  ensure  that  the  next  wave 
of urbanization does not lock in the limitations of 
most of today’s cities.

Cities  are  where  everything  comes  together:  our 
ideas, our culture, our economies, our aspirations, 
and so too our impacts on the planet, our vulner-
abilities, and, increasingly, much of our inequality. 

Green and inclusive growth can proceed only if it 
is  well  and  truly  anchored  at  the  city  level.  The 
Sustainable Cities Partnership is just one example 
of  how  the  issue  of  cities  can  bring  together  a 
disparate  collection  of  stakeholders,  all  of  whom 
have much to gain by participating, and much to 
contribute to sustainable cities.

Next Steps for Cities and Their Partners

The  Urbanization  Knowledge  Platform  held 
extensive  consultations  with  city  leaders,  devel-
opment practitioners, policymakers, and academics 
in  13  countries  and  5  regions.  The  goal  was  to 
discuss  stakeholders’  issues  and  concerns  about 
enhancing  citizen  welfare,  the  economic  contribu-
tions of urbanization, and sustainable urban devel-
opment. Based on these consultations, seven critical 
urban  challenges  emerged.  Table  8  summarizes 
these challenges and the associated needs. 

Challenge

126 BUILDING SUSTAINABILITY IN AN URBANIZING WORLD

To develop sustainably, cities need a credible voice 
in  global  policies,  ﬁnance  to  speed  implemen-
tation, and access to information. The Sustainable 
Cities Partnership has identiﬁed speciﬁc areas for 
cities and their partners to focus on:

 (cid:96) Data  collection:  Cities  and  their  agencies 
should  collect  relevant  and  credible  infor-
mation and apply practical tools to help improve 
decision  making  for  cities.  The  data  needs  to 
provide  a  composite  picture  of  their  environ-
mental 
impacts  and  overall  consumption, 
emissions,  and  outputs—that  is,  their  urban 
metabolism. This will allow diagnostics, bench-
marking,  and  relevant  indicators  to  be  estab-
lished  for  cities,  which  in  turn  enable  cities 
to  track  their  service  delivery  and  well-being 
over  time  and  compared  to  other  cities.  Such 
comparison  are  particularly  useful  for  cities 
to learn from one another and form networks 
around common objectives. 

 (cid:96) Assessing paths to sustainability at sector 
level: Cities and their agencies should gather 
data  with  a  special  focus  on  buildings  (retro-
ﬁtting,  reuse,  new  green  building  codes), 
energy  eﬃciency  (sources  of  loss,  potential 
eﬃciency  gains),  transport  (ﬂeet  composition, 
capture of land value increases, role of personal 
vehicles,  type  of  fuel,  electriﬁcation  policies), 
land  use  planning  and  density  management, 
and basic service provision (water, wastewater, 
solid waste, drainage). 

 (cid:96) Costing  the  alternatives  and  acquiring 
stable  ﬁnance:  Cities  should  encourage  the 
use  of  frameworks  such  as  natural  capital 
accounting,  and  ensure  that  these  are  appli-
cable at the local level.

 (cid:96) Discussing  and  articulating  local  sustain-
ability  goals:  Cities  should  mainstream 
sustainability  planning  into  multi-year  devel-
opment  planning  processes.  They  should 

articulate  their  own  sustainable  development 
goals  and  encourage  their  national  govern-
ments  to  aggregate  these.  Useful  models 
for  urban  sustainability  planning 
include 
Local  Agenda  21,  the  Urban  Environmental 
Accords,  City  Development  Strategies,  Green 
Plans,  and  Sustainability  Master  Plans.  The 
planning  process  should  involve  considering 
sustainability  within  traditional  cost-beneﬁt 
analysis, garnering public support, and identi-
fying  sources  of  ﬁnance  that  can  make  these 
long-term plans aﬀordable for the city budget.

 (cid:96) Sharing  knowledge  among  institutions: 
Cities,  institutions,  and  partners  should  work 
toward  the  use  of  common  tools  to  guide, 
monitor,  and  communicate  progress.  These 
include  the  Global  Protocol  for  Community-
Scale GHG Emissions.45 the GCIF, and UNEP’s 
Knowledge  Centre  on  Cities  and  Climate 
Change.46  The  use  of  information  nodes  by 
institutions at the city, regional, national, and 
international  levels  will  ensure  that  credible 
information  on  sustainable  cities  is  widely 
available and regularly updated. 

 (cid:96) Collaborating  with  partner  cities  in  other 
parts  of  the  world:  Cities  should  partner  to 
share important lessons, facilitate innovation, and 
help to spread a new sustainable cites paradigm.

Next Steps for the Sustainable  
Cities Partnership 

The Sustainable Cities Partnership is an evolving 
network rather than a formal body with a uniform 
agenda.  The  group  as  a  whole  has  agreed  on 
broad  aspirations,  while  individual  members  are 
pursuing  speciﬁc  programs  that  are  aligned  with 
their own core objectives as well as the mission of 
the wider partnership.

PART IV: THE PATH FORWARD 127

Going forward, our general goals are to:

 (cid:96) Develop a common lexicon of terms, tools, and 

metrics for sustainable cities.

 (cid:96) In  the  public  sector,  identify  the  beneﬁts 
derived  from  well-functioning  public  institu-
tions;  discuss  policy  alternatives,  including 
carbon tax and fuel subsidies; and have open 
dialogue with constituents regarding the legit-
imate issues faced by cities and the urgency of 
moving forward.

 (cid:96) Highlight  the  role  of  the  private  sector  and 
mobilize businesses to help innovate investment 
products,  processes,  and 
for 
sustainable  urban  development,  while  ensuring 
that the needs of cities and their residents are met. 

institutions 

 (cid:96) Develop  a  decision-making  framework  based 
on  a  simple,  qualitative,  multi-dimensional 
analysis  that  captures  the  various  impacts  of 
green growth policies.

More speciﬁcally, the partnership can contribute to 
a variety of urban sustainability objectives (Table 
9), and several concrete commitments have been 
made. Partners plan to collectively develop some 
key building blocks of sustainable cities, working 
along the following lines of action:

 (cid:96) The World Bank and other partners will period-
ically compile and disseminate the Large Urban 
Areas Compendium introduced in Chapter 5. 
Partners also plan to provide available city data 
to the GCIF for standardized data monitoring, 
and  to  regularly  update  information  relevant 
for  cities  at  diﬀerent  levels  of  development, 
emissions, and technological capacity. 

 (cid:96) Partners will provide coordinated input to other 
key  products,  such  as  standardized  risk  evalua-
tions using the Urban Risk Assessment method-
ology (Box 38). 

 (cid:96) The  Institute  for  Sustainable  Infrastructure 
(ISI)  is  taking  the  lead  to  develop  an  infra-
structure rating tool. As part of a memorandum 
of  understanding  on  climate  change  and 
common  urban  metrics  signed  by  all  IFIs  at 
meetings of the IPCC in December 2010 and 
2011, the infrastructure rating tool will provide 
a platform to assess the sustainability of infra-
structure projects. Those projects with a partic-
ularly high sustainability rating may be eligible 
for preferential funding, such as green bonds. 
As of June 2013, a draft of the tool exists and is 
being piloted by several engineering ﬁrms. 

 (cid:96) Annex  19  presents  the  South  Africa  Cities 
Accord  that  emerged  during  the  Durban 
COP17. The Accord recognizes that urban data 
collection should ﬁrst rest with respective cities. 
Annual  and  open  publication  is  best.  Where 
practical, city indicators should have a globally 
recognized format or standard.

 (cid:96) The USGBC, in partnership with the World Green 
Buildings  Council,  is  leading  the  development 
of  a  common  guideline  for  green  buildings.  As 
shared  guidelines  emerge,  cities  are  expected 
to  support  their  widespread  application,  as  are 
agencies such as the World Bank and members of 
the Sustainable Cities Partnership.

 (cid:96) City agencies like C40 and ICLEI—as well as 
national  city  associations,  national  govern-
ments,  and  international  organizations—are 
working  with  cities  to  develop  new  strategies 
for  coordinating  sustainable  development, 
meshing  urban  climate  change  mitigation, 
adaptation,  and  basic 
service  delivery. 
An  example  is  the  Climate  and  Clean  Air 
Coalition  (CCAC),  a  broad  and  growing 
partnership  that  aims  to  reduce  short-lived 
climate  pollutants  such  as  methane,  black 
carbon, tropospheric ozone, and hydroﬂuoro-
carbons. CCAC includes an initiative on solid 
waste management.

 (cid:96) The  WBCSD  will  work  with  the  Sustainable 
Cities  Partnership  to  develop  an  approach 
for  cities  to  create  smart  city  platforms.  This 
should be broad enough for cities in both devel-
oping and developed countries, and structured 
to  facilitate  clear  and  publicly  communicated 
public-private partnerships.

As  urbanization  continues  apace  and  eﬀorts 
toward  sustainable  development  intensify,  cities 

will  need  greater  cooperation  and  more  partner-
ships.  These  partnerships  are  often  likely  to  be 
ad hoc and transient, but in other cases trust will 
grow,  ties  will  strengthen,  and  cities  and  their 
agents  should  beneﬁt  signiﬁcantly.  This  report 
is  intended  to  nurture  a  stronger  relationship 
between the varied players in the urban space. The 
needs are enormous and urgent, but so too are the 
opportunities.

ANNEX 2
The Green City Index Series

Urbanization  has  enormous  environmental  conse-
quences, both global and local. Already, city-dwellers 
are estimated to be responsible for up to 70 percent 
of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions (IEA 2008). 
Sprawling  urban  development  consumes  arable 
land and vital green spaces. Burgeoning numbers of 
city residents put pressure on water infrastructure, 
waste  management,  sewer  systems,  and  transport 
networks. In order to tackle climate change, avoid 
lasting damage to vital ecology, and maintain the 
health and well-being of billions of people, solutions 
to these problems must be sought at the city level.

The development of such solutions, however, will 
depend on the knowledge generated from bench-
marking  urban  performance  and  sharing  of  best 
practices  across  cities.  Many  such  benchmarking 
initiatives and tools are emerging from community-
based  organizations  (e.g.  ICLEI),  academia,  and 
the  private  sector,  addressing  myriad  aspects  of 
urban performance and sustainability. The Green 
City Index is one of these benchmarking tools. 

The challenge moving forward is twofold: these tools 
and systems need to be harmonized, and methods 
for data collection and analysis standardized; and 
city participation needs to become more universal, 
easier, and based on less ad hoc criteria for selection.

Conducted as a research project by the Economist 
Intelligence  Unit  and  sponsored  by  Siemens, 
the  Green  City  Index  series  has  sought  to  focus 
attention  on  urban  environmental  sustainability. 
The  series  began  with  reports  on  cities  Europe 
in  2009,  and  has  since  analyzed  a  total  of  more 
than 120 cities in the United States and Canada, 
Asia,  Latin  America,  and  Africa,  with  Australia 
and  New  Zealand.  The  many  lessons  contained 
in these reports are intended to help cities under-
stand  their  strengths  and  weaknesses,  and  learn 
from each other as they debate policies and strat-
egies  to  minimize  their  environmental  footprint, 

while at the same time accommodating population 
growth and promoting economic opportunity.

Methodology: What the Green City 
Index Measures

The Green City Index methodology was developed 
by the Economist Intelligence Unit in cooperation 
with  Siemens.  Independent  urban  sustainability 
experts  also  advised  on  the  methodology  and 
provided  insight  into  the  key  ﬁndings  for  each 
region. Cities were selected for their size and impor-
tance (mainly capital cities and large population or 
business centers). They were chosen independently, 
rather  than  relying  on  requests  from  city  govern-
ments  to  be  included  or  excluded,  in  order  to 
enhance each index’s credibility and comparability. 

The  Green  City  Index  series  measures  cities  on 
approximately  30  indicators  across  eight  to  nine 
categories,  covering  carbon  dioxide  emissions, 
energy  consumption,  buildings  and  land  use, 
transport,  water,  sanitation,  waste  management, 
air quality, and environmental governance. About 
half  of  the  indicators  in  each  Index  are  quanti-
tative,  and  usually  these  make  use  of  data  from 
oﬃcial public sources—for example, carbon dioxide 
emissions per capita, water consumption per capita, 
recycling  rates,  or  air  pollutant  concentrations. 
The  remainder  are  qualitative  assessments  of  the 
city’s environmental policies—for example, commit-
ments  to  sourcing  more  renewable  energy,  traﬃc 
congestion reduction policies, or air quality codes. 
The speciﬁc indicators diﬀer slightly by geography, 
taking into account data availability and the unique 
challenges  in  each  region.  Measuring  quantitative 
and  qualitative  indicators  together  means  the 
indices are based on current environmental perfor-
mance as well as future intentions to be greener. 

Each city received an overall index ranking and a 
ranking  for  each  individual  category.  The  results

Methodology

Note: The European Green City Index analyzed cities on the basis of 16 quantitative and 14 qualitative indicators in eight categories. This basic methodology was adapted for the 
other indices, taking into account data availability and regional environmental challenges.

were presented numerically (for the European index 
and the U.S. and Canada index) or in ﬁve perfor-
mance  bands,  from  “well  above  average”  to  “well 
below average” (for the Asian, Latin American and 
African indices). Bands were used in regions where 
levels  of  data  quality  and  comparability  did  not 
allow for a detailed numerical ranking.

The Index Leaders: Wealthier  
and Good with Governance 

The leading cities across the regional Indices had 
several  factors  in  common.  Wealth  was  a  clear 
driver; cities with more money can invest in infra-
structure  and  set  aside  more  generous  budgets 
for environmental oversight. A second key factor 
was governance—the city’s commitment to robust 
and  innovative  environmental  policies  across  all 
categories,  from  energy  to  air  quality.  Another 
driver was consistency. Cities doing very well overall 
didn’t necessarily place number one for each of the 
eight or nine categories, but were usually near the 
top across the board. This suggests that successful 

cities are following a holistic approach to environ-
mental management (see key lessons, below).

Autonomy and a Uniﬁed Strategy 
Required: Key Lessons  
from the Index Series

In search of a holistic approach. Top-performing 
cities  take  a  holistic  approach  to  environmental 
problems,  recognizing  that  performance  in  one 
category, such as transport, is linked to success in others 
such as air quality. These cities often have dedicated 
environmental  departments  and  structured  commu-
nication between departments with diﬀerent respon-
sibilities  (for  example,  water,  waste  management, 
and  transport).  One  of  the  best  examples  from  the 
series  is  Curitiba.  As  early  as  the  1960s,  faced  with 
rapid  population  growth,  city  oﬃcials  implemented 
proposals  to  reduce  urban  sprawl,  create  pedestrian 
areas and provide low-cost rapid transit. By the 1980s, 
the  urban  plan  involved  integrated  initiatives  that 
addressed issues such as the creation of green areas, 
waste  recycling  and  management,  and  sanitation. 

ANNEX

141

Boston,  New  York,  San  Francisco,  and  Seattle  all 
scored  well  in  the  U.S.  and  Canada  Index,  largely 
because  they  have  integrated  their  environmental 
programs  into  wider  development  strategies  that 
simultaneously revitalize their economies and make 
urban  areas  more  livable.  These  cities  stand  out  as 
examples  pointing  the  way  forward.  In  many  cities 
around  the  world,  diﬀerent  departments  manage 
diﬀerent aspects of sustainable urban development, 
with no one setting the overall strategy. 

Cities  need  more  autonomy.  One  important 
driver  for  urban  sustainability  is  autonomy  at  the 
municipal  level.  Top-performing  cities  such  as 
Singapore and Hong Kong have the authority to set 
their  own  environmental  policies  and  the  funding 
to  implement  them.  This  autonomy  allows  local 
oﬃcials to set their own priorities and respond more 
eﬀectively  to  local  needs  without  depending  on  a 
more  removed  national  government,  which  may 
have competing priorities. Unfortunately, weak local 
governments are a widespread problem, especially 
in the developing world. In Africa, decentralization 
of power from the national to the local level is crucial 
for eﬀective planning, but there is a trend towards 
national  governments  taking  even  more  authority 
over decisions about cities. Strong local governments 

were one of the main reasons for the relatively high 
ranking of South African cities, as well as Accra.

The  Tipping  Point:  Income  and  Environmental 
Performance.  In  most  regions  there  was  a 
connection between a city’s wealth (as measured by 
GDP per capita) and its performance in the Green 
City  Index;  the  higher  the  income,  the  better  the 
result. Especially in developing cities, rising incomes 
initially cause higher levels of resource consumption, 
waste, and pollution. The Asian Index shows that 
only  when  GDP  per  capita  rises  above  approxi-
mately $20,000 per person is there a boost for the 
environment—a  tipping  point  at  which  wealthy 
residents  start  to  consume  relatively  less  water, 
generate less waste, and produce less carbon. Osaka, 
Singapore, Taipei, and Tokyo all showed evidence 
of this phenomenon in the Asian Index. Generally 
speaking,  as  city  residents  reach  a  certain  level  of 
wealth, they tend to acquire a growing awareness of 
environmental issues. They begin to support policies 
that limit consumption in favor of promoting urban 
sustainability and improved livability.

Not only for the rich: What developing cities can 
achieve. Although wealth undoubtedly plays a role 
in  environmental  performance,  the  Green  City

142 URBAN DEVELOPMENT SERIES – KNOWLEDGE PAPERS

Index series shows that low-cost actions can have big 
beneﬁts. Delhi in particular shows that those less well 
oﬀ  can  adopt  policies  and  shape  attitudes  towards 
sustainability. The city had one of the lowest levels of 
GDP per capita in the Asian Index, at an estimated 
$2,000. Yet it still achieved an average overall rating, 
with a strong result in the waste category, where it 
ranked above average. This is in part because of what 
has been called Delhi’s “traditional culture of careful 
consumption”—a  tendency  to  reuse  and  recycle  as 
much as possible. Building on this, however, Delhi 
has introduced advanced policies, including one of 
the  more  robust  strategies  in  the  index  to  reduce, 
reuse,  and  recycle  waste,  demonstrating  just  how 
much  can  be  achieved  with  limited  resources  and 
popular  support.  Indeed,  public  engagement  in 
policies is often a prerequisite for successful policies 
in any city, developed or developing. In the European 
index, there was a correlation between levels of civic 
engagement and environmental performance.

Low-income  cities  can  also  look  to  international 
agencies  to  ﬁnance  environmental  goals.  One 
example  is  Vilnius,  ranked  13th  in  the  European 
index, making it the best-performing city in Eastern 
Europe  and  among  the  low-income  cities  in  the 
European Index. The city took advantage of funding 
from the World Health Organization Healthy Cities 
project  to  promote  the  use  of  cycling  and  public 
transport.  It  also  drew  on  European  Union  funds 
to improve its water supply and treatment network.

Conclusion: Apples to Apples—the 
Challenge of Collecting Comparable 
Data Worldwide 

Data collection was a challenge to some extent in 
all of the regions covered by the Green City Index 
series.  Many  cities  diligently  collect  key  environ-
mental data and update it regularly. The challenge 

comes when comparing information across cities. 
For  example,  in  Europe,  one  of  the  more  acces-
sible  regions  in  terms  of  environmental  metrics, 
around one-third of the 30 cities in the Index did 
not measure the full amount of energy consumed 
in  their  city  or  the  associated  carbon  dioxide 
emissions.  In  many  cases,  the  Economist  Intel-
ligence  Unit  made  statistical  estimates  (extrapo-
lating from partial data or national ﬁgures) to ﬁll 
data gaps. Overlapping jurisdictions within regions 
was a challenge too—data for energy, transport, or 
air quality may have been collected at the metro-
politan level in some jurisdictions, the municipal 
level in others, or in some cities not at all. A related 
problem  was  that  urban  agglomerations,  which 
need to be integrated into municipal planning for 
sustainability policies to be eﬀective, often lacked 
a  single  data  source.  In  addition,  in  developing 
cities,  acquiring  data  on  informal  settlements, 
which  have  huge  environmental  impacts,  proved 
especially diﬃcult.

Overall, across the Green City Index regions, there 
were  very  few  instances  in  which  one  single  data 
point—carbon  dioxide  emissions  per  capita,  for 
example—was measured and reported in the same 
way in each region. This lack of comparability is a 
call to action in itself. Establishing a set of agreed-
upon  global  metrics  for  urban  carbon  emissions, 
energy  consumption,  air  quality,  and  other  key 
environmental performance indicators would be a 
major step towards providing policymakers with a 
comprehensive  assessment  of  their  cities’  current 
environmental  footprint.  More 
importantly,  a 
consistent set of sustainability indicators would help 
reveal the most appropriate municipal policies and 
eﬃcient investments to improve green performance.

ANNEX 3
Global City Indicators Facility (GCIF)

The  Global  City  Indicators  Facility  (GCIF)  is 
positioned  to  be  the  deﬁnitive  and  authoritative 
compilation of validated, self-reported, worldwide 
urban data. For the ﬁrst time, a database hosting 
globally  comparative  city  data  based  upon  a 
globally  standardized  methodology  provides  a 
platform  for  comparative  global  research.  This 
Facility  also  provides  a  solid  base  for  evidence-
based  policy  and  management  at  the  local  level 
to  build  more  sustainable  cities.  Headquartered 
in  Toronto,  the  GCIF  is  rapidly  becoming  a 
global leader and centre of excellence on globally 
standardized  city  metrics.  As  cities  worldwide 
increasingly  take  centre  stage  in  the  sustainable 
economic development and prosperity of nations, 
the  need  for  globally  comparable  data  and 
knowledge on cities has never been greater.  

The GCIF hosts a standardized system of global city 
indicators with support from the World Bank, the 
University of Toronto, the Government of Ontario, 
Canada, and a worldwide network of participating 
cities. Currently, 115 indicators across more than 
200  cities  are  collected  annually.  GCIF  member 
cities are representative of all regions of the world, 
and the GCIF aims to increase membership to 250 
cities by 2012, 500 cities by 2015, and 1,000 cities 
by 2020. The GCIF indicators are undergoing ISO 
review for standardization. 

To date, no city data conforms to a standardized 
methodology that can ensure sound comparative 
urban research for global learning on sustainable 
cities.  The  GCIF  provides  cities  with  a  free, 
web-based system to enter city data, track progress 
over  time  and  facilitate  capacity  building  and 
knowledge  sharing.  Globally  comparative  data 
strengthens  cities’  policy  leverage  and  perfor-
mance  management 
through  evidence-based 
decision  making.  Citizens  and  businesses  are 
empowered through transparent access to accurate 

performance  information  about  their  cities  and 
other  cities  in  a  comparative  global  framework. 
The GCIF also provides support for international 
development  agencies’  provision  of  validated, 
worldwide urban data. 

The mission of the GCIF is to improve knowledge 
on cities worldwide through the collection, organi-
zation, and analysis of urban information, thereby 
assisting  cities  globally  in  evidence-based  policy, 
planning  and  management,  and  comparative 
learning for sustainable cities. 

The GCIF strives to 

 (cid:96) improve the capacity for researchers to undertake 

comparative analysis of cities globally;

 (cid:96) help city leaders make informed, evidence-based 

decisions; 

 (cid:96) provide globally comparative city data for senior 
levels of government responsible for economic 
productivity and global competitiveness;

 (cid:96) empower  the  business  sector  and  citizens 
through access to accurate performance infor-
mation about their cities and other cities in a 
comparative global framework;

 (cid:96) support  international  development  agencies  in 
the provision of validated, worldwide urban data;

 (cid:96) provide  a  standardized  tool  for  cities  to  make 
global comparisons and track performance over 
time; and 

 (cid:96) improve understanding of cities in key sectors 
including  ﬁnance,  sustainability,  climate  risk, 
transport,  emergency  services,  water,  waste 
management,  housing  and  all  city  services, 
diversity  and  quality  of  life,  from  the  local  to 
global scale; 

144 URBAN DEVELOPMENT SERIES – KNOWLEDGE PAPERS

Website 

The GCIF website (www.cityindicators.org) provides 
an  uncomplicated  relational  database  for  cities  to 
input, manage, and update indicators for their city. 
It  provides  member  cities  with  a  tool  to  measure 
progress  toward  achieving  performance  goals, 
access  information  about  peer  cities  globally,  and 
share information as well as expertise. The website 
also  increases  transparency  in  terms  of  providing 
the business sector and the public at large, as well 
as the international development community, with 
accurate  performance  information  about  their 
cities, and generates essential, baseline urban data 
for the academic community. In addition, the GCIF 
website  is  a  tool  for  senior  levels  of  government 
responsible  for  economic  productivity  and  global 
competitiveness. The GCIF’s online presence facili-
tates  the  dissemination  of  not  only  the  indicators 
data, but also research documents, global reports, 
policy briefs, and other publications. 

Indicators 

The GCIF Indicators are structured around 20 
themes  and  measure  a  range  of  city  services 
and  quality  of  life  factors.  City  performance 
relative to each of these themes is measured by 

a suite of indicators that collectively tell a story. 
Recognizing  the  diﬀerences  in  resources  and 
capabilities  between  world  cities,  the  overall 
set  of  indicators  has  been  divided  into  “core” 
indicators, which all member cities are expected 
to  report  on,  and  “supporting”  indicators, 
which  all  cities  would  be  encouraged,  but  not 
expected, to report on. The current set of global 
city  indicators  was  selected  based  on  a  pilot 
phase with nine cities and from signiﬁcant input 
from  the  current  member  cities,  ensuring  that 
these  indicators  reﬂect  city  information  needs, 
interests, and data availability.

Sustainable Infrastructure Rating System 

Envision™ System Establishes Holistic 
Framework for Rating Sustainability  
of Infrastructure Projects

The  environment  for  infrastructure  has  become 
increasingly challenging as demands for energy and 
water resources climb. The professionals who design 
and build these projects face a tall order in the years 
ahead: satisfying ever-growing demand, while at the 
same time responsibly addressing the potential eﬀects 
caused by climate change and the increasing demand 
for  resources  by  integrating  sustainable  techniques 
in infrastructure design and construction. The civil 
infrastructure that best meets those challenges—and 
that can serve as an example to others—can now be 
rated  by  Envision™,  a  rating  system  developed  to 
gauge infrastructure sustainability. 

Envision™ is the product of a strategic alliance and 
collaboration  of  several  organizations,  including 
the  Institute  for  Sustainable  Infrastructure  (ISI),  a 
nonproﬁt organization co-founded by the American 
Public  Works  Association,  the  American  Society 
of  Civil  Engineers,  and  the  American  Council  of 
Engineering Companies; and the Zofnass Program 
for  Sustainable  Infrastructure  at  the  Harvard 
University Graduate School of Design.

To  meet  the  serious  infrastructure  challenges 
society  currently  faces,  the  Envision™  rating 
system  is  designed  to  be  used  as  an  integrated 
educational  and  resource  library,  as  well  as  a 
project-assessment system. The assessment recog-
nizes  the  need  to  stretch  the  traditional  design 
boundaries.  Infrastructure  projects  should  be 
judged not only by how they are delivered, but by 
how long they last, accounting for durability, ﬂexi-
bility, and utility of the constructed works. 

The new sustainable infrastructure rating system 
will  evaluate  and  grade  infrastructure  projects, 

recognizing  those  that  provide  progress  and 
contributions for a sustainable future. Its purpose 
is to foster a necessary and dramatic improvement 
in the performance and resilience of physical infra-
structure  across  all  dimensions  of  sustainability: 
economic, social, and environmental. 

Designers, 
infrastructure  decision  makers, 
and  the  public  currently  face  a  proliferation  of 
sustainability  rating  tools,  most  of  which  focus 
on the performance of a particular infrastructure 
element, rather than its contribution to the system 
in  which  it  resides.  To  address  this,  Envision™ 
instead establishes a holistic framework for evalu-
ating and rating infrastructure projects against the 
needs and values of the community. It ensures that 
the  sustainability  of  tomorrow’s  infrastructure  is 
assessed  accurately  by  considering  the  entire  life 
cycle of projects at a systems level. Envision™ not 
only asks, “Did we do the project right?” but also, 
“Did we do the right project?” 

In addition, Envision™ raises the bar on sustain-
ability  performance  by  recognizing  eﬀorts  that 
replenish  and  restore  natural  resources  and 
ecosystems,  and  by  evaluating 
infrastructure 
throughout its full life, with ratings for design and 
planning,  construction,  operations,  and  decom-
missioning.  The  initial  release  of  Envision™ 
addresses  the  design  and  planning  phase,  with 
subsequent phase ratings to follow.

Within  each  phase,  sustainability  objectives 
are  organized  in  three  tiers:  categories,  subcat-
egories,  and  assessment  objectives  called  credits. 
Sixty  credits  are  arranged  into  ﬁve  primary 
categories  that  represent  primary  attributes  of 
sustainable  infrastructure  solutions:  Quality  of 
Life,  Leadership,  Resource  Allocation,  Natural 
World,  and  Climate  and  Risk.  Each  of  the  60 
credits is explained in a detailed guidance manual

and  includes  the  credit  name,  intent,  levels  of 
achievement,  description,  explanation  on  how  to 
advance to higher achievement levels, evaluation 
criteria  and  documentation,  sources,  and  related 
credits.  By  meeting  objectives  within  a  credit, 
projects earn points toward their rating score. The 
achievement of points within the credit is scaled to 
ﬁve levels to ensure all eﬀorts to achieve sustain-
ability are rewarded proportionally. 

Recognition  of  the  challenges  and  complexity 
of  achieving  sustainability  is  a  necessary  step 
in  improving  infrastructure  development.  The 
purpose  of  Envision™  is  to  initiate  a  systemic 
change  that  improves  not  only  project  perfor-
mance,  but  the  mindsets  of  designers,  project 
owners,  and  decision  makers—to  transform  the 
way infrastructure is designed, built, and operated.

ANNEX 6
Engineering for Sustainable Development

The engineering community has myriad important 
roles to play in improving human living standards 
and  protecting  and  restoring  the  environment. 
In  particular,  engineers  have  already  taken  steps 
in  support  of  the  sustainability  goals  articulated 
in the Rio Summit in 1992. Moving forward, the 
World  Federation  of  Engineering  Organizations 
has  identiﬁed  ways  in  which  the  profession  can 
more  eﬀectively  contribute  to  sustainable  devel-
opment in the future. 

Engineers  approach  sustainability  in  terms  of 
the systems they design and build. A sustainable 
system  is  one  that  is  either  in  equilibrium,  or 
one  that  changes  slowly  at  a  tolerable  rate.  This 
concept is based on the characteristics of natural 
ecosystems, which consist of nearly closed resource 
and  energy  loops  that  change  slowly  and  are 
resilient to external shocks. 

A closed-loop ecosystem model has been proposed 
to illustrate the roles of engineers in every phase of 
a  human  ecosystem  that  mimics  natural  systems 
(see Figure 1). 

Engineers can

 (cid:96) extract and develop natural resources in closed-

loop, low-impact systems;

 (cid:96) process  and  modify  resources  eﬃciently,  and 
with  minimal  adverse  environmental  impacts 
throughout full product life cycles;

 (cid:96) design and build transportation infrastructure to 

improve quality of life and meet human needs;

 (cid:96) meet  the  needs  of  consumers  by  designing 

useful products and services;

 (cid:96) recover  resources  and  minimize  waste  by 

designing products for reuse and recycling;

 (cid:96) produce  and  distribute  non-fossil  energy  and 

design energy-eﬃcient products; and

 (cid:96) oﬀset the impacts of industrial activity by designing 
programs to clean up and reuse old waste sites, along 
with other forms of environmental restoration.

ANNEX

As  the  primary  designers  of  the  world’s  infra-
structure,  engineers  build  projects  and  deliver 
services  whose  ultimate  purpose  is  to  meet 
human  needs.  Increasingly,  however,  addressing 
the  environmental  impacts  of  these  projects 
has  become  an  equally  important  role.  Given 
the  broad  range  of  issues  and  sectors  in  which 
engineers  work,  they  can  contribute  signiﬁcantly 
to  achieving  sustainability  goals  along  the  entire 
chain of modern production and consumption.

There  are  approximately  15  million  engineers 
in  the  world  today,  and  they  encompass  several 
disciplines 
(civil,  environmental,  mechanical, 
electrical, 
industrial,  agricultural, 
chemical, 
mining,  petroleum,  and  computer  engineers). 
Engineers are involved with two kinds of projects:

1.  They  design  and  build  projects  that  meet  basic 
human  needs  (potable  water,  food,  housing, 
sanitation, energy, transportation, communication, 
resource development, and industrial processing).

2.  They  solve  environmental  problems  (create 
waste  treatment  facilities,  recycle  resources, 
clean up and restore polluted sites, and protect 
or restore natural ecosystems).

Both types can be implemented with sustainable 
development as a primary goal, by planning and 
building projects that preserve natural resources, 
are cost-eﬃcient, and support human and natural 
environments.  In  each  phase  of  the  ecosystem 
model shown in Figure 1, engineers fulﬁll several 
functions and can actively contribute to sustainable 
development. Some examples of these roles: 

 (cid:96) Developing and extracting natural resources

 (cid:96) Water resource planning of all kinds, including 

dams, irrigation systems, and wells 

 (cid:96) Designing tree plantations and managing forests

 (cid:96) Improved land-use planning to protect natural 

resources from the impact of urban sprawl 

Processing and Modifying Resources 

In  the  past,  many  industries  generated  waste 
products that were toxic and not easily degraded 
under natural conditions. In the last 100 years, this 
has led to environmental pollution and new laws 
and regulations to help protect the environment. 
Many  industries  are  now  making  major  changes 
in  the  ways  they  use  raw  materials  to  produce 
products. By reducing their waste to a minimum, 
many are ﬁnding that resource-eﬃcient processing 
leads to increased proﬁts. 

Engineers  play  the  following  roles  in  processing 
and modifying resources:

 (cid:96) They change industrial processes to reduce the 

use of energy, resources and waste. 

 (cid:96) They  consider  the  total  input  and  output  of 

operations over their complete life cycles.

 (cid:96) They apply the principles of industrial ecology—
for  example,  creating  eco-industrial  parks, 
where  several  industries  are  co-located  and 
waste  products  are  used  as  the  raw  materials 
for other industries. 

Transportation 

Engineers  are  at  the  forefront  of  developing 
transportation  systems,  including  designing  and 
building all-weather roads and highways, designing 
more eﬃcient engines and transportation vehicles, 
and  constructing  railroads  and  high-speed  rail 
systems. 

150 URBAN DEVELOPMENT SERIES – KNOWLEDGE PAPERS

In the future, engineers will design these transpor-
tation systems that

 (cid:96) Meeting Consumer Needs 

As the rapid urbanization of the developing world 
continues in the coming decades, the engineering 
profession  will  have  a  growing  responsibility  to 
help  provide  shelter,  infrastructure,  and  other 
resources to this population. The roles of engineers 
in meeting human needs include: 

Some environmental pollution is inevitable in the 
future,  resulting  from  resource  extraction,  indus-
trial  processing  and  transportation,  and  wastes 
generated  by  humans.  The  impacts  of  residual 
wastes  should  be  oﬀset  by  a  variety  of  environ-
mental restoration projects, such as:

 (cid:96) Treating and restoring old industrial waste sites 

 (cid:96) Restoring the ecology of lakes and wetlands 

 (cid:96) Renewing aging urban areas in large cities

 (cid:96) Creative  land  planning  and  development  to 

minimize negative environmental impacts 

Energy Production and Use 

 (cid:96) Designing housing and commercial buildings, 
streets, utility lines, public transportation, and 
other infrastructure

 (cid:96) Reducing the risks of damage and loss of life 

from natural hazards 

Resource Recovery and Reuse 

For sustainable development to be possible, human 
activities will have to be redesigned to maximize 
resource  eﬃciency.  Engineers  can  assist  in  this 
process in several ways:

The  long-term  eﬀects  of  increased  fossil  energy 
use,  with  attendant  greenhouse  gas  emissions, 
will produce major changes in the Earth’s climate. 
One of the greatest engineering challenges will be 
to  develop  less  carbon-intensive  energy  sources, 
while  simultaneously  reducing 
total  energy 
consumption.  The  roles  of  engineers  in  energy 
production may include the following:

 (cid:96) More  eﬃciently  extracting  and  processing 

remaining petroleum and gas reserves

 (cid:96) Improving  the  eﬃciency  of  electric  power 

generation, transmission, and distribution

 (cid:96) Design better solid waste collection and storage 

facilities. 

 (cid:96) Expanding the use of renewables (hydroelectric, 

solar, geothermal, wind, and biomass energy).

ANNEX

151

Engineers can also play a role in conserving and 
reducing the use of energy in the following ways:

 (cid:96) Designing energy-eﬃcient buildings and indus-

trial processes

 (cid:96) Designing  more  eﬃcient  automobiles  and 

public transportation systems

The  engineering  profession  will  be  called  upon 
to  fulﬁll  these  and  many  other  roles  in  the 
design,  building,  operation  and  maintenance  of 
sustainable cities.

Accomplishments of the Profession 
Since the First UN Conference  
on Environment and Development 

Following  the  Rio  Summit  in  1992,  a  group  of 
engineers made a systematic analysis of the confer-
ence’s primary action document, Agenda 21. They 
found that of the 2,500 issues in Agenda 21, 1,700 
have  engineering  or  technical  implications,  and 
at  least  241  appeared  to  have  major  engineering 
implications. In the 20 years since the Rio Summit 
of 1992, progress has been slow but encouraging. 
The accomplishments include the following:

 (cid:96) International engineering organizations formed a 
new entity, the World Engineering Partnership for 
Sustainable Development (WEPSD). Engineering 
societies  also  formed  environmental  committees 
at  both  national  and  global  levels  to  consider 
environmental issues. 

 (cid:96) Many  engineering  organizations  developed 
environmental  policies,  codes  of  ethics,  and 
sustainable development guidelines. 

 (cid:96) Engineering groups contributed to the creation 

of the Earth Charter.

 (cid:96) Educational programs were started to introduce 
sustainable development concepts to engineering 
students and practicing engineers. 

 (cid:96) Industrial  processes  were  improved  to  reduce 
the  use  of  resources  in  manufacturing  and  to 
reduce waste products. 

Future Goals

Engineers believe that many of the challenges of 
sustainable  urban  development  can  be  solved 
by  using  existing  knowledge,  technology,  and 
experience,  combined  with  new  innovations.  For 
the engineering profession, these innovations will 
be in the following areas:

 (cid:96) Sharing  information.  Creating  a  compre-
hensive  program  to  identify  and  provide  the 
information 
in  developing 
countries  need  to  meet  energy  requirements, 
as well as other basic human needs like food, 
health services, and infrastructure.

that  engineers 

 (cid:96) Global education programs. Expanding global 
educational  programs  on  sustainable  devel-
opment  for  students  and  practicing  engineers, 
in order to make sustainable development more 
understandable and easier to apply to real-world 
engineering projects.

 (cid:96) Engineers  as  environmental  generalists. 
Encouraging  more  engineers 
to  become 
environmental generalists to broaden perspec-
tives in engineering and equip them to assume 
leadership  roles  in  education,  industry  and 
government.

 (cid:96) Engineers in decision making. Becoming actively 
engaged  in  the  full  range  of  decision  making

menting  projects.  Engineers  can  help  direct  the 
course of important projects—and foster sustainable 
development—by involving themselves in all stages 
of a project’s decision making. 

 (cid:96) Environmental impacts and costs. Improving 
methods  for  identifying  and  considering  all  of 
a  project’s  environmental  costs  and  impacts 
throughout  a  project’s 
life  cycle.  Practical 
approaches should be developed that would alter 
conventional  accounting  practices  to  factor  in 
the direct and indirect environmental costs of a 
facility through its life cycle of operations. 

 (cid:96) Direct  assistance  programs.  Creating 
programs  to  provide  hands-on  help,  share 
knowledge  and  provide  assistance  on  techni-
cally viable, commercially feasible, and socially 
sustainable projects in developing countries. For 
example, engineering ﬁrms that have extensive 
experience  should  be  encouraged  to  partner 
with engineers in less developed countries. This 
teaming, built into project requirements, could 

be an eﬀective way to increase the capabilities 
of local engineering ﬁrms and practitioners.

toward 

 (cid:96) Policy, principles, and partnerships. Supporting 
well-crafted  policies  and  creative  applications 
of  engineering  principles,  and  committing  to 
partnerships  with  social  and  physical  scien-
tists  and  health  and  medical  professionals. 
Engineers should move beyond their disciplines 
to  evaluate  alternatives  and  to  eﬀect  policy 
changes 
sustainable  development. 
They  should  develop  partnerships  with  other 
design  professionals,  economists,  and  social, 
environmental, and physical scientists to arrive 
at  environmentally  sustainable  and  socially 
equitable solutions. This means that engineers, 
along with other technical professionals, should 
actively engage in the full life cycle of decision 
making  processes,  including  the  interdisci-
plinary process of building the evaluation and 
decision  framework  and  the  infrastructure  to 
realize the required sustainable future.

OECD, Ranking Port Cities 
with High Exposure and 
Vulnerability to Climate 
Extremes

2008

Evaluated 136 port cities of over 1 million 
population with exposure to 1-in-100-year, 
surge-induced ﬂood events. The study looks at 
the exposure of population and assets in 2005 
and those predicted in 2070 for different climate 
change scenarios. Future predictions account 
for population growth, urbanization, ground 
subsidence, and climatic changes.

Munich Re, Megacities 
Megarisks

2004

The index is composed of three variables: 
exposure to hazards, vulnerability of the built 
environment, and value of exposed property. 
Vulnerability is based on an estimation of 
the vulnerability of the predominant form of 
residential construction to hazards, the standard 
of preparedness, and safeguards including 
building regulations, urban planning for speciﬁc 
hazards, and ﬂood protection, as well as building 
density. The values of exposed property are 
estimated using the average values per household 
and the GDP for commerce and industry.

Munich Re Group’s NatCat database was 
used to prepare a natural hazard risk 
index for 50 of the world’s largest (over 2 
million population) and most economically 
important cities (based on city GDP as 
a percentage of a country’s GDP). The 
index analyzed 30 large cities in low- and 
middle-income nations and 20 large cities 
in high-income nations.

City-speciﬁc population projections to 2050 for 
this report are combined with geographic patterns 
of hazard events representative of the 1975–2007 
period.

City rankings developed on 
2005 population exposure and 
asset exposure, as well as 2070 
population and asset exposure 
Disaster risk other than 100-year, 
surge-induced ﬂood events 
are not assessed.

The index is most heavily 
inﬂuenced by the exposure to 
asset values, followed by hazard. 
Vulnerability plays a lesser role.

Current city rankings are based 
on 2005 hot-spot study. The 
forthcoming study will include 
analysis on revised data.

The Disaster Deﬁcit, Local Disaster, and Prevalent 
Vulnerability indices (DDI, LDI and PVI) are risk proxies 
that measure different factors that affect overall 
risk at the national level. IADB gas also developed 
the Risk Management Index, the ﬁrst systematic 
and consistent international technique developed to 
measure risk management performance.
The index combines three sub-indices capturing a 
country’s exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. 
The ﬁrst, exposure, is based on an index measuring the 
strength of future climate change relative to today’s 
natural variability (Baettig et al. 2007). The index is 
available on a country basis and includes both annual 
and seasonal temperature and precipitation indicators. 
It combines the number of additional hot, dry, and 
wet years; hot, dry, and wet summers; and hot, dry, 
and wet winters, projected over the 2070–2100 period 
relative to the 1961–1990 period. This suggests that 
the countries most exposed to future climatic change 
are Russia, Albania, Turkey, Armenia, and, to a lesser 
extent, Macedonia and Tajikistan.

landslides, ﬂoods, drought, and cyclones. 
Three indicators were used:
1. Disaster-related mortality risks, assessed for 
global gridded population
2. Risks of total economic losses, assessed for global 
gridded GDP per unit area
3. Risks of economic losses expressed as a 
proportion of the GDP per unit area for each grid cell

The PREVIEW Global Risk Data Platform is a 
multiple-agency effort to share spatial data 
information on global risk from natural hazards. 
Users can visualize, download, or extract data 
on past hazardous events, human and economic 
hazard exposure, and risk from natural hazards. It 
covers tropical cyclones and related storm surges, 
drought, earthquakes, biomass ﬁres, ﬂoods, 
landslides, tsunamis, and volcanic eruptions. 
The collection of data is made via a wide range 
of partners. This was developed as a support 
to the Global Assessment Report on Disaster 
Risk Reduction (GAR) and replaces the previous 
PREVIEW platform available since 2000. Many 
improvements were made on the data and on the 
application.

DesInventar is a conceptual and methodological 
tool for the construction of databases of loss, 
damage, or effects caused by emergencies or 
disasters. The Network of Social Studies in the 
Prevention of Disasters in Latin America (Red de 
Estudios Sociales en Prevención de Desastres 
en América Latina - LA RED) conceptualized a 
system of acquisition, consultation, and display 
of information about disasters of small, medium, 
and greater impact, based on pre-existing data, 
newspaper sources, and institutional reports in 
nine countries in Latin America. The developed 
conceptualization, methodology, and software 
tool is called the Disaster Inventory System, or 
DesInventar (Sistema de Inventario de Desastres, 
DesInventar). It includes: Methodology (deﬁnitions 
and help in the management of data)
Database with ﬂexible structure
Software for input into the database
Software for consultation of data (not limited 
to a predeﬁned number of consultations). with 
selection options for search criteria.
HAZUS-MH is a powerful risk-assessment 
methodology for analyzing potential losses from 
ﬂoods, hurricane winds, and earthquakes. In 
HAZUS-MH, current scientiﬁc and engineering 
knowledge is coupled with the latest GIS 
technology to produce estimates of hazard-
related damage before, or after, a disaster occurs. 
Potential loss estimates analyzed in HAZUS-MH 
include:
Physical damage to residential and commercial 
buildings, schools, critical facilities, and 
infrastructure; economic loss, including lost jobs, 
business interruptions, repair and reconstruction 
costs; and social impacts, including estimates 
of shelter requirements, displaced households, 
and population exposed to scenario ﬂoods, 
earthquakes and hurricanes.
The UK-based Tyndall Centre for Climate Change 
Research uses data relating to natural disasters 
for the assessment of recent historical and 
current risk associated with climatic variability. 
Current risk associated with extreme climate 
events is used as a proxy for risk associated with 
climate change in the future. The data used is 
derived from EM-DAT with population data from 
the World Bank. 

ANNEX 13
Summary of “The Next Frontier of E-Government*

In  1950,  one-third  of  the  world  population  lived 
in  cities.  Half  a  century  later,  the  proportion  had 
increased  to  one-half,  and  it  is  estimated  that  by 
2050, 6 billion people (that is, two-thirds of the world 
population) will live in cities. Currently the urban 
population of developing countries is projected to 
double in 30 years, increasing from 2 billion in 2000 
to 4 billion in 2030. In less than 10 years, most of 
the “megacities” emerging from that process will be 
located in developing countries (see Figure 1).

Such  projections  obviously  raise  questions  about 
the  ability  of  the  cities  of  the  future  to  sustain 
this  type  of  growth  while  maintaining  adequate 
levels  of  production  and  delivery  of  key  public 
services  such  as  water,  transport,  electricity, 
sanitation,  education,  and  containment  of  crime 
and pollution. There is, however, another side to 
this  equation,  often  overlooked.  It  relates  to  the 

emerging role of cities (and of subnational entities 
generally) to become global players—as attractors 
of foreign investment, competitiveness hubs, and/
or  platforms  for  the  combination  of  local  and 
international  components  of  global  production 
and supply chains.

At  the  same  time,  more  and  more  governments 
around  the  world  are  seizing  opportunities  to 
move to “e-government” as a way of enhancing the 
eﬀectiveness and eﬃciency of their national public 
sectors,  in  particular  through  outsourcing  the 
production and delivery of public services to the 
private sector. This trend compounds another one, 
by which central governments have been delegating 
an increasing number of their traditional respon-
sibilities  to  subnational  entities  such  as  states, 
regions,  municipalities,  or  cities.  Many  phrases

to describe or justify such a process, including new 
federalism in the United States, de-centralization and 
de-concentration  in  many  European  countries,  and 
even subsidiarity in the EU.

We  are  hence  witnessing  the  rapid  convergence 
and  combination  of  three  trends:  (a)  the  growth 
in size and economic weight of local entities such 
as  cities;  (b)  the  increasing  ability  and  will  of 
governments to use information technologies and 
outsourcing  to  fulﬁll  their  tasks  and  serve  their 
citizens better through e-government; and (c) the 
growing potential (and obligation) of local entities 
(typically cities) to act as global players, designing 
and implementing their own policies and strategies 
to attract investment and carving out their share of 
beneﬁts from the emerging global economy.

The Emergence of ‘Local Global Players’ 

Both  economic  and  urban  literatures  have  long 
identiﬁed  cities  as  key  players  in  global  compe-
tition,  and  even  as  central  engines  in  shaping 
and  spreading  globalization  itself.  Phrases  such 
as global cities1, world cities2, or networked cities3 have 
been coined in the process. A growing number of 
local  governments  are  emerging  as  “local  global 
players” 
international 
markets and investments. Regularly, international 
magazines  publish  rankings  of  cities  worldwide, 
according  to  cost  of  living  and  quality  of  life. 
Sometimes called e-cities, Internet cities, or knowledge 
cities, new “e-ready” hubs seem to spring up around 
the world.

(LGPs),  competing  for 

eﬀorts and governance that are key determinants 
of  the  success  and  the  competitiveness  of  “local 
global hubs” are less often noticed or quantiﬁed. 
Local  e-government  is  emerging  today  as  a 
powerful tool by which such LGPs have enhanced 
and will continue to enhance their own competi-
tiveness and that of their respective countries. 

In many parts of the world, building and promoting 
local  champions  of  e-readiness  is  perceived  as 
a  national  priority  by  central  governments.  In 
countries as diverse as Tunisia, Morocco, Senegal, 
Russia, the United Arab Emirates, Mexico, Qatar, 
or Saudi Arabia, major plans are being designed 
and launched to build local versions of IT parks, 
business  process  oﬀ-shoring  (BPO)  centers,  and 
Internet/knowledge  cities  in  an  eﬀort  to  capture 
part  of  the  increased  foreign  direct  investment, 
employment, and economic growth that deepening 
globalization is expected to bring.

It  is  increasingly  recognized  that  it  is  not  only  a 
national government-led policy decision to support 
a certain industry such as ICT over others—as in the 
case of a localized IT park or a municipal decision 
to implement a city strategy for global excellence. 
It is not only a top-down or supply-driven approach 
that is causing local performance to gain relevance, 
yet relatively little attention has been given so far 
to  analyzing  on  a  globally  comparative  basis  the 
role of e-government services in successful LGPs.

How Do ICT and E-Government 
Beneﬁt Local Global Players?

Successful LGPs (such as Singapore, for example, 
or  Andhra  Pradesh  in  India),  have  combined 
superior  levels  of  connectivity,  a  capable  pool  of 
human resources, and an innovative private sector. 
All of these can be furthered by local government 
policy; however, the quality and eﬃciency of local 

Apart from typical national e-government services 
such  as  registrations,  customs,  taxation,  and 
elections, it is local governments that have direct 
contact  with  citizens  for  a  multitude  of  services; 
these  local  governments  also  attend  to  a  large 
number of citizens’ needs. Speciﬁc e-government

services  are  increasingly  handled  at  the  local 
rather  than  national  level.  This  is  the  case,  for 
instance,  for  small-  and  medium-sized  enterprise 
(SME)  registration,  vehicle  and  drivers’  licenses, 
enrollment  at  educational 
institutions  and 
vocational programs, furthering human resources 
skills, or professional authorizations and licenses 
(for  example,  for  shops,  pharmacies,  and  so  on). 
The  provision  of  increasing  local  e-government 
services  contributes  to  e-readiness  and  competi-
tiveness at the global level.

A Tale of Many Cities

Although  analytical  eﬀorts  have  been  made  to 
describe  local  e-government  initiatives  and  their 
good  practices,  remarkably  little  attention  has 
been  granted  to  measuring  the  e-readiness  of 
subnational  spaces,  including  cities.  Two  of  the 
more  useful  attempts  to  measure  “urban  perfor-
mance” or competitiveness are by Kaufmann et al. 
at  the  World  Bank  and  by  Rutgers  University  in 
collaboration with South Korea’s Sungkyunkwan 
University  in  Seoul.  Kaufmann  et  al.  include 
indicators  that  are  vital  to  determining  a  city’s 
level  of  e-readiness,  such  as  access  to  electricity, 
telephone lines, mobile telephones, and Internet in 
schools.4 In contrast, the Rutgers-SKKU e-Gover-
nance  Performance  Index  2005  aims  at  ranking 
cities  in  terms  of  e-government  performance, 
leaving  out  some  indicators  of  e-readiness  such 
as  access  to  ICT  and  the  enabling  environment. 
Combined  with  the  World  Economic  Forum/
INSEAD’s  Global  Information  Technology  Report’s 
Networked Readiness Index (NRI) 2006, in which 
one can ﬁnd a signiﬁcant number of key indicators 
that  are  relevant  to  the  local  level—for  example, 
regulatory environment, intensity of local compe-
tition,  ﬁrm-level 
technology  absorption,  and 
protection  of  property  rights,  these  three  sets 

4See Kaufmann et al. (2006).

of  data  shed  preliminary  light  onto  the  local 
e-government trends.

By comparing the overall city e-governance score 
of  the  Rutgers-SKKU  dataset  with  the  overall 
country networked readiness score of the NRI, one 
ﬁnds  that  the  link  between  e-government  perfor-
mance of individual cities and the e-readiness of 
their  respective  countries  is  not  straightforward 
(see Figure 2a).

In Figure 2a, the overall trend demonstrates that 
the majority of countries exhibit a degree of local 
e-government  performance  (the  Rutgers-SKKU 
e-Governance Performance Index on the vertical 
axis) in line with what one could expect from their 
national  networked  readiness  score  (the  NRI  on 
the horizontal axis). However, several cities seem 
to be performing less successfully at the local level 
than  their  overall  networked  readiness  would 
indicate (for example, Kuala Lumpur, Stockholm, 
and  Helsinki).  Others,  on  the  contrary,  perform 
better  as  local  e-government  hubs  than  the 
network-readiness  of  their  respective  countries 
would  suggest.  This  is  the  case  for  Tegucicalpa 
(Honduras),  Ho-Chi-Minh  City 
(Vietnam), 
Warsaw  (Poland),  Macao,  Hong  Kong,  Shanghai 
(China),  Soﬁa  (Bulgaria),  and  Riga  (Latvia).  In 
particular, three Eastern European cities in devel-
oping  countries—Soﬁa,  Warsaw,  and  Riga—are 
scoring close to or above 50 on the city axis; they 
are  joined  by  three  additional  Eastern  European 
cities—Tallinn, Bratislava, and Budapest—once the 
bar  is  lowered  to  scores  or  40  or  higher.  Clearly 
there is a story to be told on city-level successes in 
Eastern European local e-government.

Indeed, the picture becomes more interesting and 
somewhat  diﬀerent  when  one  considers  regional 
subsamples of the same data. Because the overall 
sample—which is based on the common subset of

NRI and the Rutgers- SKKU e-Governance Perfor-
mance  Index,  making  a  total  of  76  countries—is 
small, such a disaggregation cannot be pushed too 
far. Taking it to the level of broad regions (North 
America,  South  America  and  the  Caribbean, 
Western  Europe,  Eastern  and  Central  Europe, 
Africa, the Middle East, and Asia and the Paciﬁc), 
a few interesting observations emerge.

For  Asia  and  the  Paciﬁc,  we  ﬁnd  an  ellipse  that 
is ﬂat (see Figure 2b), indicating a stronger corre-
lation  between  overall  network-readiness  and 
municipal  e-government  performance.  However, 
there are notable exceptions. Shanghai and Hong 
Kong  as  cities  rank  higher  (Shanghai  at  63.93 
and Hong Kong at 61.51) than the NRI score of 
China as a whole (3.68) would suggest. The same 
is true for Seoul, the undisputed champion of the 
Rutgers-SKKU index with a score of 81.70; while 
Korea  scores  “only”  5.14  in  this  year’s  NRI.  The 

opposite story seems to aﬀect Kuala Lumpur, which—
as a city—performs more poorly than Malaysia as a 
country. At roughly the same level of overall network-
readiness,  the  cities  of  Quezon  City  (Philippines), 
Jakarta (Indonesia), Ho Chi Minh City (Vietnam), 
and Macao, Hong Kong, and Shanghai (China)5 show 
stark diﬀerences in local e-government performance. 
To some extent, the same can be said about Tokyo 
and Sydney, which rank closely on both measures, 
but  when  compared  with  similarly  nationally 
networked Seoul, they diﬀer with a markedly lower 
local e-government score.

Moving to South America, a richer set of data oﬀers 
interesting insights about the relation between city 
and  country  performance.  Figure  2c  shows  that 
the dispersion of South American countries along 
the  spectrum  of  network  readiness  is  broader 
than  that  of  the  corresponding  countries  along 
the axis of city e-government performance—trans-

5It must be noted here that, for the purposes of this chapter, Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Macao have been treated in the same manner: e-governance indicators 
(Rutgers-SKKU data) have been mapped against the country NRI rating for China. This choice was made both for consistency reasons (treating all Chinese 
cities in the same fashion), but also because it beﬁts the overall purpose of this section, which is to identify cities for which local e-governance performance is 
above (or below) what the NRI performance of their respective national environments would suggest.

lating visually in a rather ﬂat ellipse covering the

Paolo  (Brazil)  clearly  outperform  their  respective 
countries, while Santiago (Chile) seems to tell the 
opposite story. The diﬀerence is striking between 
the  respective  city-level  e-government  perfor-
mances  of  cities  such  as  regional  high-performer 

Sao  Paolo  on  one  hand  and  Mexico  City  on  the

similar levels of overall networked readiness.

complex  picture,  even  if  one  separates  Western 
Europe from Eastern and Central Europe (Figure

2d). A ﬁrst conclusion is that the diﬀerence between 
“old Europe” and “new Europe” is much less visible 
from the point of view of cities’ performance than it is 
from that of overall network readiness. At the national 
level,  Estonia,  the  birthplace  of  Skype,  remains 
the  network  readiness  champion  among  emerging 
European economies, but most of the other Eastern 
European  economies  considered  also  compare  well 

with  the  laggards  of  Western  Europe  (for  example, 
the  Czech  Republic,  Hungary,  Lithuania,  Slovenia 
compare  favorably  with  Cyprus,  Greece,  and  Italy). 
However,  on  the  city  scale,  Eastern  Europe  has  a 
number of superior performers, including Bratislava 
(Slovakia), Prague (Czech Republic), Soﬁa (Bulgaria), 
and,  above  all,  Warsaw  (Poland)  and  Riga  (Latvia), 
who are leaders in the European region as a whole.

overall  process  of  globalization.  The  advent  of 
short-range telecommunications technologies such 
as WiFi or WiMAX, combined with the regulatory 
space  oﬀered  to  broadband  providers  generally, 
are  allowing  the  emergence  of  new  business 
models that provide information-intensive services 
(including  e-government)  at  the  local  level.  In 
countries where most of the steps have been taken 
to establish e-government at the national level (as 
is the case in many Latin American countries, for 
instance), possibilities for taking advantage of new 
advances in IT seem to be even more signiﬁcant 
at the local (and particularly municipal) level. For 
the next few years, and for all those reasons, the 
local level can truly be seen as the next frontier of 
e-government on a worldwide scale. 

 (cid:96) The  various  regions  of  the  world  tell  diﬀerent 
stories about the respective abilities of national 
economies and cities to enhance their respective 
levels  of  network  readiness,  and 
to  use 
e-government as a tool for competitiveness, good 
governance, and improvement of the quality of 
life of their citizens. However, they all show (even 
if at varying degrees) that the digital divide is less 
broad between cities than it is between countries. 
This results not only from the superior agility of 
smaller economic spaces to seize opportunities 
in  rapidly  changing  environments,  but  also 
from the fact that LGPs tend to network almost 
naturally with each other—the result of common 
technical constraints (for example, international 
ports  need  to  adopt  common  procedures  and 
technical norms to accommodate certain types 
of vessels, or deal with multi-modal transport), 
or of the emergence of standard practices in the 
ways  in  which  global  business  is  being  carried 
out across national borders. In all regions, some 
world  cities  emerge  from  the  pack,  showing 
higher  rates  of  e-readiness  (and  e-government 
readiness) than their respective countries.

The  e-government  performance  of  those  last  three 
cities  is  clearly  higher  than  their  respective  overall 
networked readiness levels would indicate. The city-
level dataset oﬀers further insight into the leadership 
of Warsaw, Prague, Riga, and Tallinn with regard to its 
subindices on usability, content, and service delivery. 
Notably,  no  Eastern  European  city  scored  well  in 
the  privacy  and  security  subindex;  however,  they 
performed well (often being in the top 10) in the other 
categories (usability, content, and service delivery).

Finally, the dataset used in this study oﬀers only 
a small set of cities for three regions (two cities in 
North America, three in the Middle East, and four 
in  Africa—if  one  includes  Cairo  in  Africa  rather 
than in the Middle East)—a sample that is not suﬃ-
ciently large to make signiﬁcant observations. One 
can  notice,  however,  that  in  those  three  regions 
the correlation between the NRI and the Rutgers-
SKKU index is strong (see Figure 2e).

The Next Frontier: Local E-Readiness

The analysis above has led to three major conclusions:

 (cid:96) Subnational  economic 

(cities 

spaces 

in 
particular)  have  played  a  central  role  in 
shaping the current wave of globalization. The 
emergence of LGPs can be seen as a revenge of 
geography, whereby the beneﬁts of the “death 
of distance” (which have allowed international 
operators  to  invest,  produce,  and  sell  across 
global  networks  of  cooperation)  have  been 
combined with those of the physical proximity 
or  congregation  of  local  players  (for  example, 
ICT hubs in India, or more complex combina-
tions of talents such as in London’s City). 

 (cid:96) The dynamics of the ICT sector, and of ICT infra-
structure and services in general, tend to reinforce

Piloting in Sustainable Cities

Building sustainable cities will require a transfor-
mation, over the coming four decades, as signiﬁcant 
as the Industrial Revolution. This transformation 
will occur at the intersection of clean energy and 
ICT (Rifkin 2011). The Climate Group is calling 
it  the  Clean  Revolution—a  massive  scale-up  of 
technologies,  solutions,  business  models,  and 
governance  to  put  the  world  on  a  path  toward  a 
low-carbon,  sustainable  future.  We  will  need  to 
provide for 7 billion (or more) people who will be 
living in cities in 2050, with an additional 3 billion 
entering the middle class. And we must do all this 
at just one-tenth of the greenhouse gas emissions 
we produce today (Climate Group 2009).

It is in cities that governance is needed to make this 
transition  possible,  along  with  supporting  political 
action  at  sub-national  and  national  levels.  Cities 
and local authorities are hubs for innovation. Cities 
are  also  prime  sites  for  doing  more  with  less  and 
ﬁnding the beneﬁts from increased concentration of 
people, while avoiding negative externalities such as 
congestion,  loss  of  amenities,  higher  prices  for  key 
services such as electricity, and peak energy demand. 

How Do Cities Make  
the Clean Revolution a Reality? 

The  early  stages  of  the  Clean  Revolution  are 
already underway, characterized by pilot projects 
that  test  new  solutions  to  a  city’s  challenges, 
involve  the  private  sector,  and  test  new  ways  to 
inﬂuence  behavior,  before  the  city  makes  large 
investments in new infrastructure, technologies, or 
services. Pilots are taking place around the world 
in  response  to  climate  change  and  sustainability 
challenges. Case studies appear on websites and in 
technical papers in academic journals. 

Pilots, or small-scale rollouts of solutions that are 
phased  to  scale  over  time,  help  city  leaders  and 

the  private  sector  build  conﬁdence  in  new  ways 
of  meeting  citizens’  needs.  If  the  city  has  made 
long-term  goals  very  clear,  pilots  arise  indepen-
dently either from the private sector or other actors. 
In other cases, they arise directly from investment 
by the city or national government, which may set 
up special funds for pilot projects. The European 
Commission  regularly  funds  sustainable  city 
solutions as part of Framework Programme (FP7) 
research funding.6 Stimulus packages around the 
world in the last four years have supported “green 
growth” solutions. Singapore is investing $1 billion 
in clean energy-related projects in order to attract 
talent and solutions to Singapore. The World Bank 
and  other  multilateral  institutions  fund  climate 
change-related mitigation actions, many of which 
occur in cities. 

Two  key  criteria  for  successful  sustainable  cities 
are  (a)  the  involvement  of  private  actors  such 
as  NGOs  and  businesses,  and  (b)  support  for 
individual behavior change—for instance, through 
the provision of information on cost- and energy-
saving  measures.  Private  actors  may  provide 
funding, independently or through public-private 
partnerships; they may provide new and innovative 
technologies, specially developed or adapted from 
what  is  done  elsewhere;  they  can  provide  infor-
mation and knowledge, and help disseminate it to 
citizens.

The  main  areas  of  city  consumption  that  lead 
to  unsustainable  use  of  resources  are  electricity 
(lighting, appliances, electronic devices), building 
heating and cooling, transportation, and industry. 
In  each  of  these  areas,  it  is  possible  to  replace  a 
high-carbon 
lower-carbon 
version, or provide alternative activities that result 
in lower-carbon emissions.

City pilot projects may therefore be broadly diﬀer-
entiated into two areas:

1.  Replacing  an  existing  technology  with  a 
better,  more  sustainable  version  of  that 
technology. A classic example is incandescent 
lighting, which can be replaced by much more 
eﬃcient forms of lighting such as LEDs. 

2.  Trying a new service or modiﬁcation to the 
existing  service.  In  tackling  transportation 
congestion challenges, a policy maker has the 
choice to encourage vehicles themselves to be 
more eﬃcient (such as with CAFE standards7), 
encourage  reductions  in  the  use  of  the  same 
number  of  vehicles,  or  remove  the  vehicles 
from  the  roads  altogether.  The  ﬁrst  approach 
necessitates that some of the vehicles provided 
by  the  private  sector  are  more  eﬃcient  than 
those  currently  on  the  road  (like  the  LED 
example above), and that more of these eﬃcient 
vehicles  can  be  rapidly  rolled  out,  replacing 
existing  vehicles.  This  technological  approach 
is the focus in much of the piloting work that 
private companies undertake in the laboratory 
and in the market. The other two options for 
reducing  the  impact  of  transportation  require 
changes  either  to  the  transportation  system 
itself or to citizens’ behavior, perhaps induced 
by providing information or pricing incentives 
(for  instance,  better  information  about  public 
transportation, or congestion charging). 

Piloting New Technologies

The  Climate  Group’s  LightSavers  programme  is 
an  excellent  example  of  piloting  to  support  the 
replacement  of  existing  technology  with  more 
eﬃcient  alternatives.  When  a  better  lighting 
solution exists, there are potentially many reasons 
why  it  is  not  adopted,  including  low  awareness, 
lock-in  to  a  long  procurement  process,  agency 
issues  where  investors  won’t  see  the  beneﬁts  of 
solutions, and basic lack of awareness of the new 
solution’s track record in deployment.

In  the  case  of  LightSavers,  The  Climate  Group 
used  a  technology-diﬀusion  framework  adapted 
from Everett Rogers’ work (Rogers 1983). Called 
the 5As framework, it helped to design a process 
for supporting cities in trialling new solutions and 
developing conﬁdence for those to be scaled up. 

Technologists will learn more about their product 
when  they  move  from  laboratory  testing  to  real-
world conditions. The LightSavers pilots were set 
up to support procurement managers of outdoor 
street lighting, usually in the transportation depart-
ments  of  cities,  to  design  trials  that  could  help 
them build their own knowledge of how the new 
LEDs  would  function  under  real  outdoor  condi-
tions.  It  was  then  possible  to  assess,  at  relatively 
low  expense,  which  products  functioned  best  for

Are markets, potential users, and policy makers aware of the technology potential and the 
present stage of development? Is the learning from pilots being shared sufﬁciently with 
potential users? What are the gaps to awareness?
Is the technology available locally to pilot-test and scale up signiﬁcantly?
Do existing policies or market imperfections constrain the user from adopting solutions even 
when they are available?
Can the technology compete on price with the appropriate support? What is the business case 
for procurement? Can innovative ﬁnancing overcome lack of capital?
Is the new solution ﬁnally accepted as a viable alternative to existing methods?

technology, with 75 percent of the beneﬁts going 
to other sectors (Pelissie et al. 2011).

In  trials  around  the  world  that  replaced  existing 
lighting  with  LED  luminaires  and  tested  the 
lighting quality using the same methodology, the 
ﬁndings were:8 

 (cid:96) LED  luminaires  provide  equivalent  illumi-
nation  to  High  Intensity  Discharge  (HID)  at 
half  the  energy  use,  with  even  better  perfor-
mance from smart controls. 

 (cid:96) There is excellent lumen maintenance for some 

products.

 (cid:96) There is excellent color stability for most products.

 (cid:96) On-site  system  eﬀectiveness  due  to  direction-
ality  of  LED  light  accounts  for  much  of  the

 (cid:96) Early indoor applications have a strong business 

case.

In China and India in particular, these early trials 
are  leading  to  large  procurements  of  LEDs  that 
will  signiﬁcantly  reduce  emissions  from  outdoor 
lighting in those cities.

Piloting New Models, or Modifying 
Existing Services 

The  Internet  and  the  devices  that  connect  to  it 
are  changing  our  economy.  McKinsey  recently 
found that the Internet contributes 3.4 percent to 
GDP, more than energy or agriculture, and it has 
contributed 21 percent of GDP growth in the last 
5 years, a dramatic rise from the previous decade. 
It also contributes 2.6 jobs for every one lost due to 

8  Final report, LightSavers, forthcoming 2012 

The  Climate  Group’s  partnerships  to  pilot  new 
services emerged from our work on the enabling 
role of ICTs. The Internet, together with laptops, 
printers,  mobile  phones,  and  the  networks  and 
data  centres  that  support  them,  are  estimated 
to  account  for  2–3  percent  of  global  emissions. 
However, if used appropriately, they may also help 
make  existing  activities  more  eﬃcient  or  allow 
new  options  for  services  to  become  possible.  In 
2008,  the  SMART  2020  report  showed  that  15 
percent of global emissions could be saved in 2020 
through ICT-enabled energy eﬃciency, by making 
buildings,  transportation,  industrial  processes, 
and  the  electricity  grid  more  eﬃcient  (Climate 
Group 2008).

For  instance,  smart  metering  solutions  provide 
many  new  capabilities  beyond  the  existing 
“dumb”  meters.  The  beneﬁts  discussed  from 
smart  meters  include  their  network  eﬀects, 
otherwise  known  as  the  smart  grid:  With 
dynamic  information  available  about  the  “last 
mile”  of  electricity,  gas,  or  water  networks,  it 
is  possible  to  better  match  energy  supply  with 
demand.  Citizens  can  in  theory  see  real-time 
feedback  about  their  actions.  And  utilities  can 
manage increasing intermittent sources of power 
(such as wind) more eﬀectively.

Cities  have  become  the  site  for  solution  trials 
because  it  is  in  the  city  that  transportation, 
buildings,  and  electrical  systems  intersect,  and 
therefore  where  much  of  the  SMART  2020 
potential can be realized. As noted in Chapter 3 
of  this  report,  broadband  digital  infrastructure 
can interconnect people and city systems, allowing 
cities  and  their  residents  to  respond  to  changing 
circumstances nearly in real-time.

Cisco’s  Connected  Urban  Development  (CUD) 
program9 has conducted pilots to demonstrate the 
role of ICTs in saving greenhouse gas emissions, 
such  as  “smart  work”  solutions  that  help  people 
avoid  travelling  at  peak  traﬃc  times  and  help 
employers 
in  buildings.10
Some  of  these  ideas  are  beginning  to  take  hold 
more widely. In a recent survey of C40 cities, new 
ICT-enabled initiatives such as smart grids, cycle 
rental  schemes  and  real-time  traﬃc  information 
provision are being rolled out in about one-third 
of the cities (C40 and Arup 2011).

 (cid:96) Objectives  for  each  economic  actor  may  not 
be  aligned  with  social,  economic,  or  environ-
mental value for the city and citizens. 

 (cid:96) Cities are complex organizations, and decisions 
that involve multiple departments can take time 
and can often be at odds with the sales cycles of 
companies.  Procurement  cycles  for  cities  can 
take  up  to  three  years  from  initiation  to  sale, 
which  can  prevent  innovative—and  usually 
under-resourced—companies from participating 
in smart city development opportunities .12

However, there are a number of reasons why these 
solutions are diﬃcult to implement at scale, as we 
found in the recent report Information Marketplaces:11 

 (cid:96) Smart  city  plans  that  are  technology-led  run 
the  risk  of  compromising  development  plans. 
Smart  metering  is  a  case  in  point:  in  U.S. 
markets,  a  technology-driven  approach  has 
led  to  a  backlash  amongst  consumers  who 
do not see the beneﬁts of energy savings that 
were promised. The presence of smart meters 
alone does not deliver the beneﬁts promised; it 
is  when  a  critical  mass  of  them  are  deployed 
and  services  are  running  on  their  data  that 
consumers will see the value. 

 (cid:96) The  value  of  digital  investments  is  not  being 
clearly  articulated  for  all  stakeholders.  Cities 
may  be  unsure  of  the  payback  or  may  not 
possess  mechanisms  to  pay  for  up-front  costs 
even if payback is certain in the long term.

a wider audience and transitioned the work to the SMART 2020 initiative,

New Economics of Cities.

Overcoming  these  barriers  involves  designing 
pilot projects that test demand for solutions in the 
market,  not  only  the  better  supply  of  technology. 
The presence of ICT alone is not enough to ensure 
emissions savings; these tools need to be applied 
to  change  processes  or  behavior  if  emissions  are 
to be saved. 

Therefore,  a  piloting  approach  is  needed  which 
tests  the  applications  of  the  network,  not  only 
whether the technology is working in the ﬁeld as 
expected or to technical standards. As John Seely 
Brown and Paul Duguid argue in their book The 
Social Life of Information (2000), learning is demand 
driven,  and  technologies  are  dependent  upon 
social  norms  and  contexts.  “Learning  is  usually 
treated  as  a  supply-side  matter.…  But  learning 
is  much  more  demand  driven.  People  learn  in 
response to need … when they have a need, then, 
if the resources for learning are available, people 
learn eﬀectively and quickly.”

This  network  makes  it  possible  to  learn  rapidly, 
aggregating  demand  from  numerous  disparate 
individuals.  Pilots  need  to  be  designed  to  under-

stand  how  the  network  applied  to  a  particular 
challenge  will  alter  behaviors,  what  will  be  the 
potential uptake of services, what new or existing 
economic actors will be involved, and the business 
models or partnership models required to scale up 
the solution. It is the outcome of these interactions 
with technology that will save emissions or provide 
low-carbon alternatives to high-carbon activities.

An emerging model for demand-led solution piloting 
is  the  “challenge”  or  prize  approach.  Nobel  Prizes 
have long rewarded innovation in science for society, 
and more recently technology X Prizes have galva-
nized individuals to invest in problems to which no 
one has yet found the answer. Though the X Prize can 
be criticized for leading to duplication in eﬀort, with 
only one winner taking the prize when competitors 
should also be rewarded for their time and eﬀort, it 
does create urgency and a process for rapid learning. 

The  Living  Labs  Global  Award  has  applied  the 
challenge  model  speciﬁcally  to  the  city  piloting 
context. The award is designed around the insight 
that  cities  are  reinventing  the  wheel.  They  are 
struggling with challenges other cities have faced 
and are looking for home-grown solutions. 

Therefore, the ﬁrst step in becoming a participating 
city in the Living Labs Global Award is to openly 
declare  a  challenge  and  demonstrate  willingness 
to look globally for products and solutions. Once 
the  city  has  announced  its  intention  to  solve  its 
challenge, the Living Labs Global Award process 
takes the city on a journey of discovery and evalu-
ation  of  solutions  that  have  been  implemented 
elsewhere.  The  city  appoints  a  jury,  which  will 
choose in an appropriate solution for that city—not 
necessarily the most technically advanced solution.

In 2011, the third year of the prize, 20 cities have 
announced challenges13 that could reach 75 million 

citizens  globally.  Cities  will  award  the  winning 
solutions  providers  with  the  potential  to  develop 
pilot projects in their city. The Living Labs Global 
model has been designed for cities seeking “smart” 
or “intelligent” solutions, and not all are directly 
related  to  sustainability  or  climate  change.14  But 
many are: Lagos is looking for inexpensive smart 
homes that can be deployed rapidly and help the 
city provide better services to residents; Santiago 
de Chile is looking for innovative parking solutions 
to reduce environmental impact from congestion.

Key principles of the approach that may be repli-
cated in other piloting schemes are as follows:

 (cid:96) Start from the demand-side: A city’s challenge 

leads the process.

 (cid:96) Help  companies  identify  likely  prospects: 
By identifying cities ready to tackle a challenge, 
solutions  providers  can  more  quickly  identify 
which of the 557,000 local authorities are likely 
to be interested in a solution. 

 (cid:96) Provide a pre-procurement learning process 
for cities: Cities will see where the solution has 
been  implemented  before,  thereby  providing 
new  options  for  cities  to  choose  solutions  they 
may never have envisioned

 (cid:96) Shorten  the  solution  providers’  time  to 
market: Procurement can take 18 months to 3 
years, and slow citizens’ access to new services. 
By  raising  awareness  of  the  solution  in  the 
context  of  a  city’s  challenge,  it  is  possible  to 
accelerate the solution’s diﬀusion curve.

 (cid:96) Encourage  place-based  innovation:  Allow 
the city and company to work together deﬁning 
a  pilot  that  is  geographical.  (When  a  new 
service  is  tested,  it  is  important  to  test  the 
business model as much as the solution itself. 
Therefore,  the  pilot  may  need  to  occur  not 
simply at solution level but at neighbourhood 
level.15)

One  of  last  year’s  Living  Labs  Global  Award 
winners, a parking solution for Helsinki,16 is one 
example of a new way of thinking about parking—
“directed” parking. It is scalable to other cities and 
has  the  potential  to  save  emissions  and  time,  all 
while  providing  revenue  for  citizens,  businesses, 
and the city. The platform creates a marketplace 
for  parking  spaces  that  lets  individuals  sell  their 
spots if they are away, or would let restaurants oﬀer 
parking  along  with  dinner  reservations.  Cities 
can calculate their earnings from better access to 
public parking spots or the emissions saved from 
vehicles that go straight to a parking spot instead 
of circling for many polluting minutes. While this 
solution  relies  on  a  range  of  technologies  (the 
network  infrastructure,  mobile  phones,  a  billing 
and  booking  system,  and  data  applications),  the 
service’s  success  requires  a  business  model  that 
provides  incentives  for  people  to  change  their 
behavior.  The  pilot  project  will  need  to  test  the 
business model in the city context.

The  Living  Labs  Global  Award  process  demon-
strates  how  cities  can  attract  innovative  climate 
and  sustainability  solutions  that  are  contextual, 
demand-driven, and use the power of the network 
to hasten the learning process.

Achieving Outcomes: Scale-Up of Pilots

Many challenges to sustainability and green growth 
in cities remain, even if successful pilots are underway. 
Investors are not always the beneﬁciaries of solutions, 
as we see in buildings where owners do not manage 
the day-to-day operations. Lack of skills (or the need 
to retrain) as new technologies and solutions emerge 
has to be considered early, or solutions will remain in 
the nascent stage. Changes in behavior are diﬃcult to 
predict, and infrastructure choices may lock in high-
carbon behaviors for years to come.

What  both  the  piloting  approaches  above  have  in 
common is that a group of cities are piloting at the 
same time. In each case, sharing the learning is a 
key part of bridging information gaps and building 
conﬁdence in expanding solutions to more citizens. 

In  the  case  of  the  LightSavers  trials,  cities  that 
pilot  in  parallel  can  share  technical  knowledge 
and  compare  results  in  diﬀerent  cities.  Certain 
luminaires  may  work  better  in  certain  climates. 
Particular  conﬁgurations  of  street  lighting  may 
lend themselves better to one product or another. 

In  the  case  of  Living  Labs  Global,  the  concen-
tration  of  city  challenges  generates  huge  interest 
amongst  service  providers  and  allows  each  city 
to  beneﬁt  from  the  awareness  raised  about  the 
award process. Living Labs Global is also able to 
research multiple solutions at once and to generate 
independent evaluation data across thousands of 
solutions that can be used by all the cities, essen-
tially creating a global marketplace for solutions. 

Cities  are  the  laboratories  of  the  transition  to  a 
Clean  Revolution.  Innovation  and  pilot  project 
scale-up  will  require  signiﬁcant  investment  and 
changes  in  governance  and  ﬁnancing  that  we 
have  only  begun  to  grapple  with.  The  successful 
transition is inextricably linked with governance, 
institutional, and organisational change to ensure 
that  learning  is  shared,  pilots  are  not  repeated 
unnecessarily, and scaling the solutions is possible.

ANNEX 15
The Role of Technology in City Master Planning

Technology  is  beginning  to  transform  the  way 
cities are structured, the way people communicate 
and work, and the way resources are managed—yet 
within cities, technology is rarely adopted in a fully 
integrated and strategically designed manner. The 
traditional approach to city planning has focused 
on the physical; today, additional planning around 
the  city’s  digital  infrastructure  is  required  to 
enable long-term sustainability. Deﬁning the city’s 
digital and ICT requirements, such as high-speed 
broadband connectivity and open application archi-
tecture, alongside the city’s physical blueprint (for 
example, land use zoning and transport planning) 
and  economic  planning  (for  example,  industrial 
sector strategy and taxation strategy) will enable 
more eﬃcient, integrated services to be provided 
to citizens. Such a multi-disciplinary approach to 
urban  planning  is  practiced  by  the  business  and 
technology consulting ﬁrm Accenture (Figure 1), 
which focuses the physical-digital-economic master

planning of a city around the services required to 
meet the needs of its citizens and businesses. 

By  planning  and  deploying  technology  at  the 
city  level,  managers  can  realize  economies  of 
scale  across  departmental  silos,  such  as  energy, 
buildings, and mobility. For example, smart grids 
are bringing together our energy and telecommu-
nication grids, and electric vehicles are connecting 
our transport systems with our energy networks—
making  both  energy  and  transport  data  more 
accessible.  In  addition,  technology  enables  a 
city  to  provide  new  cross-industry  services.  In 
Singapore,  for  example,  rainfall  often  comes  in 
intense,  localized  downpours,  which  increases 
congestion in the city and makes it very diﬃcult 
to  ﬁnd  a  taxi.  The  Massachusetts  Institute  of 
Technology combined data on weather forecasts, 
GPS taxi locations and mobile phone cell propa-
gation to understand, in real time, how rainstorms 
will  aﬀect  the  city  and  to  co-locate  taxis  to  the 
high-demand areas. By using existing technologies 
in  an  integrated  fashion,  the  city  has  been  able 
to provide a useful new service to citizens and to 
better plan its resources; and citizens are able to 
get a cab even when it’s raining.17

To  realize  the  full  potential  of  technology,  cities 
need to adopt a combination of hard and soft infra-
structure.  Hard  infrastructure  includes  the  city’s 
physical  ICT  assets  (data-center  capacity,  smart 
grids,  connectivity  and  bandwidth,  software, 
and  data  visualizations),  and  soft  infrastructure 
involves  tools  to  manage  these  assets  (business 
and governance models, citizen engagement, and 
a strategic focus on ICT). Cities today are already 
making investments in hard infrastructure, such as 
smart transport and smart grid projects, to drive 

17http://senseable.mit.edu/livesingapore/

economic  and  environmental  beneﬁts.  However, 
their approach tends to be fragmented across city 
departments. On the soft-infrastructure front, local 
and  national  governments  need  to  understand 
the role they want to play in relation to the city’s 
data and digital assets, and they need to establish 
leadership  capabilities—in  the  form  of  a  Chief 
Information Oﬃce (CIO), for example—to set the 
strategic ICT direction for the city and to put in 
place  appropriate  frameworks  and  incentives  to 
enable the digital economy to ﬂourish. Placing an 
equal emphasis on soft and hard infrastructure will 
enable  cities  to  create  long  term  socioeconomic 
and  environmental  value.  The  framework  below 
(Figure 2) shows the diﬀerent levels of implemen-
tation that cities can achieve in terms of their hard 
and soft infrastructure; it highlights that, while the 

smart  city  concept  is  becoming  well-known,  the 
vast majority of cities are far from implementing 
the infrastructure required to reap the full sustain-
ability beneﬁts of smart technology.

Setting  a  single  set  of  metrics  at  the  city  level 
will  also  enable  cities  to  evaluate  the  success  of 
sustainability  initiatives  on  a  like-for-like  basis. 
For instance, smart grid projects are measured by 
a reduction in energy losses and eﬃciency gains, 
and variable road pricing schemes are measured 
by reduced traﬃc congestion. While the value of 
each project can readily be assessed at the depart-
mental  level,  it  is  less  easy  to  understand  the 
contribution of the project to the city’s overarching 
objectives. For example, how would a city compare 
the relative value contributed by a smart grid with

that contributed by variable road pricing toward 
its  city-wide  aims  of  economic  development, 
livability, and environmental sustainability? Such 
questions present a challenge to city leaders who 
need  to  make  capital  allocation  decisions  across 
a  portfolio  of  initiatives.  For  the  value  of  initia-
tives to be eﬀectively compared, a common suite 

of  metrics  needs  to  be  developed  that  ties  the 
performance of individual initiatives to the city’s 
long-term  strategic  aims.  A  single  city  scorecard, 
based  on  speciﬁc  objectives,  will  enable  the  city 
to understand the relative value of diﬀerent initia-
tives based on how well each delivers on the city’s 
overall strategy.

Eco2 Cities: Ecological Cities as Economic Cities18

Eco2 Cities is an initiative launched by the World 
Bank in 2010 as an integral part of its Urban and 
Local Government Strategy, to help cities in devel-
oping  countries  achieve  greater  ecological  and 
economic sustainability. 

that 

fully  harnesses 

Ecological cities enhance the well-being of citizens 
and  society  through  integrated  urban  planning 
and  management 
the 
beneﬁts  of  ecological  systems,  and  that  protects 
and  nurtures  these  assets  for  future  generations. 
Economic cities create value and opportunities for 
citizens, businesses, and society by eﬃciently using 
all  tangible  and  intangible  assets,  and  enabling 
productive,  inclusive,  and  sustainable  economic 
activity.

What is an Eco2 City?

An Eco2 city builds on the synergy and interde-
pendence  of  ecological  and  economic  sustain-
ability, and their fundamental ability to reinforce 
each  other  in  the  urban  context.  Innovative 
cities  in  both  the  developed  and  the  developing 
world  have  demonstrated  that  with  the  appro-
priate strategic approach, they can enhance their 
resource  eﬃciency—realizing  the  same  economic 
value from a much smaller and renewable resource 
base—while  simultaneously  reducing  harmful 
pollution and unnecessary waste. By doing so, they 
have improved the quality of life of their citizens, 
enhanced  their  economic  competitiveness  and 
resilience,  strengthened  their  ﬁscal  capacity,  and 
created an enduring culture of sustainability. Many 
of  their  interventions  have  also  provided  signif-
icant beneﬁts to the poor. Urban sustainability of 
this  kind  is  a  powerful  and  enduring  investment 
that  will  pay  compounding  dividends.  In  a  fast-

paced  and  uncertain  global  economy,  cities  that 
adopt such an integrated approach are more likely 
to  survive  shocks,  attract  businesses,  manage 
costs—and prosper. The Eco2 Cities Initiative was 
developed to enable cities in developing countries 
to  realize  this  value  and  to  and  take  on  a  more 
rewarding and sustainable growth trajectory while 
the window of opportunity is still open to them.

Unique Features of the Eco2 Cities 
Initiative

The  Eco2  Cities  Initiative  provides  cities  with  an 
analytical  and  operational  framework  that  can 
be  applied  and  contextualized  to  the  particular 
challenges of each city. The framework also includes 
methods  and  tools  that  make  it  easier  for  cities  to 
adopt the Eco2 approach as part of their city planning, 
development,  and  management.  The  Eco2  Cities 
Initiative also assists cities in developing countries to 
gain access to ﬁnancial resources needed for strategic 
urban infrastructure investments.

Another important feature of Eco2 is its bottom-up 
approach.  Innovative  best-practice  cities  around 
the  world  have  demonstrated  how  ecological  and 
economic  progress  can  go  hand  in  hand.  Eco2 
elements  systematically  build  on  these  global  best 
practices.

How The Eco2 Cities Initiative Works

The Eco2 Cities Initiative works through the appli-
cation of an analytical and operational framework 
that  helps  cities  systematically  achieve  positive 
results.  As  a  framework,  it  provides  a  point  of 
departure  and  needs  to  be  customized  to  the 
particular context of each city.

After  careful  assessment  of  cities  that  have 
beneﬁted tremendously from this sort of approach, 

188 URBAN DEVELOPMENT SERIES – KNOWLEDGE PAPERS

as well as a detailed look at the major challenges 
that have prevented similar achievements in most 
other  cities,  the  framework  has  been  structured 
around four key principles that were found to be 

integral to lasting success. These principles are the 
foundation  of  the  Eco2  initiative.  Each  principle 
is  widely  applicable,  critical  to  success,  and 
frequently ignored or underappreciated:

The  four  principles  are  interrelated  and  mutually 
supportive.  Without  a  strong  city-based  approach, 
it is very diﬃcult to fully engage key stakeholders 
through  an  expanded  platform  for  collaborative 
design  and  decision-making.  And  without  this 
expanded platform, it is diﬃcult to explore creative 
new approaches to the design and management of 
integrated  systems,  and  to  coordinate  policies  to 
implement through the one system approach. Prior-
itization,  sequencing,  and  eﬀectiveness  of  invest-
ments in sustainability and resiliency will be greatly 
enhanced  by  appreciating  the  city  as  one  system 
and expanding the platform of collaboration.

A set of core elements have been derived through 
these principles. Each city may transform the core 
elements into a series of concrete action items or 
stepping stones that take into account local condi-
tions  and  follow  a  logical  sequence.  Together, 
these stepping stones enable a city to develop its 
own unique action plan, called an Eco2 pathway 
(Figure  1).  The  Eco2  Cities  Initiative  also  intro-
duces cities to methods and tools that will lead to 
more eﬀective decision-making through powerful 
diagnostics and scenario planning. These methods 
and  tools  can  also  be  used  to  operationalize  the 
core elements and implement the stepping stones.

a Phased,

Eco2 Pathway

190 URBAN DEVELOPMENT SERIES – KNOWLEDGE PAPERS

In this context, the ideal situation is when a city 
adopts the four key principles, applies the analytical 
and  operational  framework  to 
its  particular 
context, and, by doing so, develops and begins to 
implement  its  own  sustainability  pathway.  Cities 
may begin incrementally, by engaging in capacity 
building  and  data  management  and  by  initially 
targeting their most critical priority through devel-
oping and implementing an Eco2 catalyst project. 
Unlike stand-alone projects in resource eﬃciency, 
a  catalyst  project  is  distinguished  by  an  explicit 
objective  and  an  ability—beyond  the  immediate 
project  scope  and  objectives—to  drive  the  city 
forward on its sustainability pathway by catalyzing 
the process of change.

Moving Forward Together

The  World  Bank  is  currently  collaborating  with 
cities  in  developing  countries,  their  national 
governments, the international community, global 
best practice cities, multilateral and bilateral devel-
opment  agencies,  academia,  the  private  sector, 
and  NGOs.  As  pilot  Eco2  Cities  in  developing 
countries conceptualize and implement their own 
Eco2 pathways, we hope to channel their support to 
other cities beginning their own Eco2 pathway. At 
present, national knowledge-sharing and capacity-
development  activities  are  being  implemented 
under the Eco2 framework in Indonesia, Vietnam, 
and the Philippines.

The  basic  Earth  observation  (EO)  datasets  that  are

of urban areas, together with the spatial and temporal 
distribution  of  speciﬁc  urban  land  uses  (such  as 
housing, industry, green areas, and so on). An example 
of an existing database with information on land use 
and land cover changes is the European Coordination 
of  Information  on  the  Environment  (CORINE) 
program,  and  more  speciﬁcally  the  Urban  Atlas,  a 
CORINE  component  dedicated  to  urban  mapping. 
Urban  Atlas  maps  are  developed  at  a  geometric 
resolution of 1:10,000, with a minimum mapping unit 
(MMU)  of  0.25  hectares  within  the  built-up  urban 
areas, and a lower resolution of 1-hectare MMU outside 
urban centers. They are produced with 22 urban and 
4 non-urban classes, which oﬀers signiﬁcantly better 
resolution than the CORINE classes (Figure 1). 

Making Use of Earth Observation 
Capabilities

It is estimated that public institutional users generate 
more  than  80  percent  of  the  market  demand  for 
earth  observation  data  and  services  (Keith  and 

Bochinger 2009). Free or low-cost EO data solutions 
are  preferred,  where  available.  However,  a  signif-
icant  step  forward  for  the  application  of  EO  to 
urban development monitoring was the availability 
of commercial high- and very-high-resolution (VHR) 
optical  satellites  with  a  pixel  size  of  0.5–5  meter. 
This provides better information accuracy, delivery 
time,  and  continuity  of  datasets.  In  addition,  the 
recent  launch  of  very-high-resolution  synthetic 
aperture  radar  (SAR)  commercial  missions  in 
Europe and Canada is pushing forward a range of 
applications in the urban risk-management domain 
(for  example,  assessing  risks  of  ﬂooding,  land 
subsidence, and landslides). This development is of 
interest both to the public sector (for example, civil 
protection  authorities  and  local  municipalities)  as 
well as to the private sector (for example, insurance 
and engineering ﬁrms).

The European Urban Atlas is another example of an 
operational EO application that provides homoge-
neous and up-to-date information on more than 300 
European  cities.  It  oﬀers  comparable  information 
on the density of residential areas, commercial and 
industrial zones, the extent of green areas, exposure 
to  ﬂood  risks,  and  monitoring  of  urban  sprawl 
(essential  for  public  transport  and  infrastructure 
planning in urban and peri-urban areas). This type

of  information  is  routinely  used  by  city  govern-
ments and other European institutions such as DG 
REGIO, DG ENV, and the European Environment 
Agency.19  At  present,  the  Urban  Atlas  maps  are 
also  being  used  to  produce  a  set  of  derived  city 
indicators (for example, land cover and use, green 
urban area per inhabitant, urban sprawl index, and 
so  on).  In  addition,  they  are  being  used  as  input 
data  for  the  modeling  of  urban  vulnerability  to 
natural hazards.20

The  combination  of  EO  and  other  datasets  can 
answer many and varied policy questions, such as: 

 (cid:96) How are cities changing over time?

 (cid:96) How much, and in what proportion of uses, is 
land being consumed for urban development? 

 (cid:96) Where are the areas with the most signiﬁcant 

land use change?

19http://dataservice.eea.europa.eu/map/UrbanAtlasBeta/
20http://moland.jrc.ec.europa.eu/evdab/HTML/home.html

 (cid:96) What are the drivers of urban and other land 
development, and what new infrastructure will 
be needed to support this development? 

 (cid:96) What  are  the  possible  eﬀects  of  natural 
disasters, and how much of the population and 
assets will be aﬀected?

Use of Earth Observation in Urban 
Disaster Risk Management

To  support  disaster  risk  management,  high-
resolution optical and radar imagery can be used 
in  combination  to  map  and  identify  physical 
changes  in  urban  centers  resulting  from  natural 
disasters. This can be done for entire urban zones, 
or at the level of individual buildings.

A unique capability of SAR is to measure changes in 
the land surface position to high accuracy using a long 
time-series  of  EO  data.  This  method  is  being  used 
to  measure  land  subsidence  (Figure  2),  land  distur-
bances  following  earthquakes,  and  the  dynamics  of

active  volcanoes.  With  the  new  very-high-resolution 
commercial radar missions, the motion and stability of 
individual buildings and structures can be measured 
to an accuracy of a few millimeters per year. This type 
of  information  is  providing  major  new  insights  into 
identifying and understanding urban risk.

Finally,  the  combined  use  of  Earth  observation 
satellite imagery (optical and radar), in situ data, and 
advanced modeling techniques can support diﬀerent 
phases  of  the  urban  risk-management  cycle  with 
assessments  of  exposure  of  speciﬁc  infrastructure 
to multi-hazard risk, as well as the level of potential 
loss.  For  example,  the  EO-based  ﬂood  simulation 
conducted  for  the  watersheds  of  Rio  Grande  and 
Rio  Anil  in  the  Municipality  of  Rio  de  Janeiro 
(Figure 3) improved the understanding of the conse-
quences of land cover changes vis-à-vis diﬀerent land 
use  scenarios,  the  number  of  inhabitants  aﬀected 
by ﬂoods, and the amount of time available for the 
civil  protection  authorities  to  respond  in  case  of 
emergency. This type of information can be useful in 
formulating disaster prevention strategies. 

Future Directions in Earth 
Observation Capabilities

Web-based Earth observation together with GIS has 
opened  new  possibilities  for  developing  specialized 
applications that are relevant to decision makers. In 
the European space sector, the Global Monitoring for 
Environment and Security (GMES) ﬂagship program 

is  being  implemented  in  partnership  between  the 
European  Union  and  the  European  Space  Agency 
(ESA).  GMES  comprises  a  ﬂeet  of  EO  satellites,  a 
system  that  was  purpose-built  for  the  provision  of 
operational information services in the Land, Marine, 
Humanitarian  Aid,  Atmosphere,  and  Security 
domains. The system (developed through ESA) will 
provide  long-term  (decadal)  data  continuity,  which 
is  key  to  achieving  widespread  use  and  acceptance 
of EO-based information services. In terms of infor-
mation  on  the  urban  environment,  a  multispectral 
high-resolution imaging mission (10-meter resolution) 
for land monitoring will provide continuous SPOT- 
and Landsat-type data for vegetation, soil, and water 
cover,  inland  waterways,  and  coastal  areas.  GMES 
has  the  capability  to  observe  global  land  cover  at 
10-meter resolution every ﬁve days, representing an 
unprecedented  source  of  information  that  can  be 
tapped. Furthermore, the GMES Sentinel Data Policy 
is based on principles of full and open access, setting 
the trend in future data policies around the world.

It  is  evident  that  EO  can  provide  a  wealth  of  infor-
mation related to the monitoring of urban areas and 
the  development  of  larger  urban  agglomerations. 
Such  information  is  being  used  operationally  by  a 
number of institutions, and the new European GMES 
initiative  will  soon  bring  enhanced  capabilities.  A 
comprehensive  assessment  should  be  carried  out  to 
determine  exactly  what  and  how  these  new  sources 
of information can contribute to key activities in the 
urban domain and the promotion of sustainable cities.

ANNEX 19
Publishing City Information
A Proposed ‘South African Cities Accord’

The  World  Bank  released  the  report  Cities  and 
Climate Change: An Urgent Agenda at COP16 in 
Cancun,  December  2010.  This  included  a  press 
conference,  a  press  release,  printed  copies,  and 
placement  of  the  report  on  the  Bank’s  external 
website.  The  report  included  a  table  compiling 
city-based per capita GHG emissions for some 100 
cities, 45 of which were suggested to be suﬃciently 
comparable having been peer reviewed within the 
academic community. Public pick up of the report 
was considered good, but relatively modest.

The  same  table  was  included  in  a  paper  in  the 
April  2011  edition  of  the  journal  Environment 
and Urbanization. This time however the paper’s 
publication  was  accompanied  by  an  IIED  press 
release drawing attention to the ‘ranking of cities’ 
the table facilitated. The press release was picked 
up by more than 200 media outlets, and translated 
into more than 10 languages.

One  media  outlet  that  picked  up  the  IIED  press 
release  was  a  local  newspaper  in  Cape  Town. 
The front page of the local newspaper included a 
prominent headline highlighting that Cape Town’s 
per  capita  GHG  emissions  were  higher  than 
London’s. Considerable eﬀorts by City Hall staﬀ 
ensued, trying to explain the numbers and identi-
fying an error in the reported values; Cape Town’s 
GHG emissions were 7.6 tonne/capita, not the 11.6 
t/cap  reported  in  the  article  (despite  obtaining 
values from a credible peer reviewed journal).

After  extensive  discussions  between  Cape  Town 
and  World  Bank  staﬀ  the  values  were  corrected 
and  important  lessons  on  city  data  and  publi-
cation emerged. Considerable city information is 
available. Similar to countries, most of which are 
smaller  than  these  cities,  this  information  needs 
to  be  published  annually.    The  information  is 
simply  too  important  not  to  be  readily  available 

in the public domain. One of the proposals within 
this report is for the partners to publish the beast 
available  data  for  at  least  the  100  largest  urban 
areas  every  year.  As  this  report  highlights,  this 
increased  focus  on  cities  is  to  be  expected  as 
policy  makers,  city  dwellers,  and  city  managers 
themselves 
the  enormous 
importance of cities.

further  appreciate 

Much of the recent focus on city information has 
been on GHG emissions. With the February 2012 
announcement of an agreed C40-ICLEI protocol 
as  supported  by  WRI,  UNEP,  UN-Habitat  and 
the World Bank (now undergoing ISO standards 
development),  this  information  should  become 
more  common  and  regularly  published.  Eﬀorts 
to develop a common GHG standard and ensure 
regular collection and publication of data are illus-
trative. Cities need a simple process to collect and 
publish their data.

Sources of this information now include the Global 
City  Indicator  Facility  (as  supplied  by  partici-
pating  cities),  UNEP,  PwC,  UN-Habitat,  IBNET, 
World Bank. However the best source for all city 
indicators remains the city itself.

City information is not ‘owned’ by anyone; similar 
to how banks collect our household ﬁnancial data, 
doctors  much  of  our  health  data,  and  schools 
our  academic  performance,  our  personal  data  is 
increasingly dispersed and amassed electronically. 
Certainly there are enormous privacy and accuracy 
issues,  but  cities  need  to  have  a  clear  policy  on 
how ‘open’ they are willing to have their data. The 
data exists anyway, cities should therefore work to 
ensure  that  they  control  the  accuracy  and  publi-
cation of city-based data.

The Global City Indicator Facility, as supported by 
agencies such as ICLEI, C40, UCLG, CDP, WRI, 

196 URBAN DEVELOPMENT SERIES – KNOWLEDGE PAPERS

UNEP, UN-Habitat, OECD, World Bank, is struc-
tured to have as much control on data collection 
and publication by cities as possible.  Eﬀorts are 
also underway to have the methodologies subject 
to ISO standards — as with the recently announced 
GHG emissions protocol. 

Cities  are  regularly  approached  by  politicians, 
citizens,  news  media,  and  external  agencies,  to 
provide  data.  Many  of  these  requests  are  dupli-
cative.  Almost  all  cities  already  have  extensive 
data  collection  and  publication  programs.  These 
programs however, would be beneﬁt from consoli-
dation  and  global  harmonization  where  practi-
cable.  For  example,  when  the  GCIF  was  being 
established a detailed assessment of city indicators 
was  completed  for  Sao  Paul,  Porto  Alegre,  Belo 
Horizonte,  Bogota,  Cali,  Montreal,  Toronto,  and 
Vancouver. The eight cities were collecting some 
1100 indicators annually – only 2 were in common. 
Obvious eﬃciencies are possible. 

During COP17 in Durban, discussions were held 
with South African cities and a ‘City Accord on City 
Data’ was proposed by the cities of South Africa. 
The Accord would take advantage of the eﬀorts of 
the Global City Indicator Facility (of which Cape 
Town,  Durban  and  Johannesburg  are  members). 
So  too  would  the  Accord  maximize  linkages  to 
organizations  such  as  national  city  associations, 
C40, CDP, ICLEI, UCLG, Metropolis, etc.  South 
African cities are well represented in membership 
of organizations such as C40 (Johannesburg) and 
ICLEI  (African  head  oﬃce  in  Cape  Town  City 
Hall.  GHG  emissions  are  relatively  well  deﬁned 
(e.g. Johaneburg, Durban, CDP eﬀorts, and Cape 
Town’s  early  participation  in  Carbonn).  South 
African cities are also well represented in academic 
literature  and  ongoing  research  activities  (e.g. 
IPCC  participation,  biodiversity  programming, 
ecosystems  services  reviews).  Finally,  South 

Africa and its cities are uniquely placed to serve 
as a bridge across ‘high, medium and low income’ 
countries and their cities.

Reﬂecting  the  urgent  need  for  a  comprehensive 
and globally accepted city-led collection and publi-
cation  of  city  indicators,  a  South  African  Cities 
Accord  is  proposed.  The  Accord  would  be  led 
by  the  cities  of  Cape  Town,  Durban,  and  Johan-
nesburg, and supported by the South Africa Local 
Government Association. A set of principles and 
common approaches are proposed:

 (cid:96) Cities  should  be  given  ﬁrst  opportunity  to 

provide city indicator data.

 (cid:96) Cites (as deﬁned as the constitutionally mandated 
most  ‘local  government’)  should  be  given  an 
opportunity to review data prior to publication.

 (cid:96) As much as possible data should be published to 
assist in policy development and observe regional 
and international trends, not to compare.

 (cid:96) Ideally all city data should ﬁrst (or simultane-
ously) published by the city on their website or 
similar means.

 (cid:96) In  larger  urban  areas  each  local  government 
should collect and publish data and the urban 
area aggregated. Prior to all local governments 
participating  in  urban  areas  the  main  city,  or 
alternative  organization  should  publish  the 
aggregated best available data. 

 (cid:96) Data  should  be  published  annually  with  no 
more than a six-month delay in data collection, 
and six months of compilation and veriﬁcation.

 (cid:96) All  external  organizations  should  defer  to 
cities  and  their  designated  agencies  such  as

may be necessary, however the data as outlined 
in  Table  ##  is  considered  to  be  suﬃciently 
‘simple’ for any city of 1 million-plus residents 
to regularly collect (many examples exist).

 (cid:96) Ideally  the  collection  and  publication  of  city 
data  should  be  an  ongoing  part  of  a  city’s 
management – the public disclosure should not 
place an undue burden on cities.

 (cid:96) For  cities  in  low-income  countries  ongoing 
assistance  for  data  collection  and  publication 

 (cid:96) Existing  and  new  applications  of  remote 
sensing from urban areas should inform cities 
being  monitored  and  ideally  give  cities  the 
opportunity  to  review  and  comment  on  the 
information prior to publication (with at least 
a three-month review period).
