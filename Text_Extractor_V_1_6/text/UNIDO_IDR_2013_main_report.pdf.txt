Foreword

Since the eruption of the 
financial  crisis  in  2008, 
much of the public debate 
has focused, after decades 
of silence, on development 
economics:  how  to  sus-
tain growth, create lasting 
jobs, generate incomes and 
enable  the  accumulation 
of wealth, thus eradicating 
the scourge of poverty and preventing social polariza-
tion and fragmentation. The rising number of unem-
ployed people in industrialized economies, the unrest 
in  the  streets  of  Northern  Africa,  the  increasingly 
vocal  demands  from  voters  in  emerging  economies 
and the discussion towards a new international agenda 
for development, all point in the same direction – at 
the central role that productive activities and jobs have 
in the life of individuals and countries.

Yet, despite a legitimate wish for the contrary, jobs 
simply do not fall like manna from heaven. They arise 
out of economic development, from private entrepre-
neurs and governments generating new businesses and 
economic activities. Sustained job creation requires 
structural  change,  or  the  ability  of  an  economy  to 
constantly generate new fast-growing activities char-
acterized by higher value added and productivity and 
increasing returns to scale.

Since  the  industrial  revolution,  manufacturing 
has been at the core of structural change, consistently 
creating higher levels of output and employment, and 
leading to an unprecedented growth in incomes. The 
rising  incomes  led,  in  turn,  to  greater  demand  for 
manufactured goods and a relative decline in spend-
ing on agricultural products. Productivity gains raised 
demand further as prices of manufactures declined 
even more relative to those of other goods and ser-
vices. Accompanying these changes were major shifts 
in the labour force and population from agriculture 
and rural areas, initially into manufacturing and to 

urban areas, and later into services. This experience 
has repeated itself across the globe, wherever countries 
have achieved a mature stage of economic and social 
development.

For  developing  countries  aiming  to  maintain 
growth while sustaining job creation, manufacturing 
offers an opportunity not only to rebalance the econ-
omy towards higher value-added sectors but also to 
provide a relatively wide employment base with higher 
labour productivity. The transition from agriculture to 
services, especially for low-income countries, offers the 
opportunity to achieve only the first objective, not the 
second.

UNIDO’s  Industrial  Development  Report  2013 
provides  a  solid  foundation  to  correctly  frame  the 
debate  on  jobs  in  the  world  today.  Manufacturing 
remains  an  important  employer,  accounting  for 
around  470  million  jobs  worldwide  in  2009  –  or 
around 16 percent of the world’s workforce of 2.9 bil-
lion.  Moreover,  the  report  provides  a  detailed  and 
largely  path-breaking  account  of  how  structural 
change has taken place over the last 40 years.

One  of  the  key  findings  of  this  report  is  that 
countries  need  to  move  from  lower  tech  to  higher 
tech sectors, from lower value-added to higher value-
added sectors and from lower productivity to higher 
productivity sectors. The structural change analysis 
performed for this report indicates that while condi-
tions may vary significantly across time and space and 
technological change may still bring large surprises, 
the trends of the past are very likely to stretch into the 
future. There is much to learn from understanding 
history and what drove it. And there is much to learn 
by developing countries from countries both slightly – 
and further – ahead of them.

The  report  highlights  how,  nearly  40  years 
after  Member  States  of  UNIDO  issued  the  Lima 
Declaration  at  the  Second  General  Conference  of 
the Organization in 1975, in which they expressed 
their firm conviction of industry’s role as a dynamic 

xi

instrument of growth essential to the rapid economic 
and social development of the developing countries, 
particularly the least developed countries, the under-
lying principles have stood the test of time: industri-
alization remains an indispensable route to develop-
ment. Industry increases productivity and generates 
income, reducing poverty and providing opportunities 
for social inclusion. As countries further develop their 
industries,  the  motivation  to  increase  value  added 
drives a greater application of science, technology and 
innovation, encourages more investment in skills and 
education and provides the resources to meet broader 
development outcomes.

As the global community embarks on formulat-
ing a new development agenda to build on the foun-
dation laid by the Millennium Development Goals, 
the report underscores the need for integrating inclu-
sive and sustainable industrial development into this 
new agenda. This calls for an expansion of productive 
capacities and a growth of responsible value addition 
to encourage increased job creation and income gen-
eration,  while  respecting  planetary  boundaries  and 
ensuring an efficient use of scarce resources. It is only 
through inclusive and sustainable industrial develop-
ment that countries around the world, be they indus-
trialized  or  developing,  will  be  able  to  achieve  the 
socially  equitable  and  ecologically  sustainable  eco-
nomic growth that generates employment and income, 
and creates the wealth to achieve wider developmental 
goals for health, education and human rights.

Structural transformation of the economy lies at 
the heart of this process, together with conscious and 
considered measures to encourage economic growth, 
enhanced productivity and the development of tech-
nology,  innovation,  infrastructure  and  trade.  The 
report provides ample guidance on how to initiate and 

sustain such a process – by exploring the key drivers 
of structural change and providing practical policy 
options for governments of countries at different levels 
of development.

The state can use policy instruments to target key 
drivers. Education and skills, for example, would be 
underprovided in a pure market-driven environment 
as employers have too few incentives to allocate funds 
for these public goods. Similarly, limited returns on 
investment, lack of competitive finance and coordina-
tion failures make technology and innovation prone 
to market failures, resulting in underinvestment. Such 
market  failures  can  be  addressed  through  targeted 
policy measures to reduce input costs where the mar-
ket is unable to provide a reliable supply system of low-
cost and high-quality material inputs critical to local 
industries.

It gives me great pleasure to present this report at 
this early stage of my tenure as Director General of 
UNIDO.  I  am  particularly  pleased  that  the  report 
underlines the critical need for international coopera-
tion to achieve the structural change and economic 
growth required to combat poverty, and reaffirm the 
commitment of my Organization to fulfil its unique 
mandate  in  support  of  this  effort.  I  am  grateful  to 
the UNIDO staff and the international experts that 
joined hands to produce this report, and look forward 
to seeing it become a key component in the develop-
ment debate.

Glossary

Backward linkage. Input-output production relation 
between suppliers and purchasers from the view-
point of purchasers.

Bilateral  investment  treaties  (BITs).  Agreements 
between  two  countries  to  promote  and  protect 
investments in each other’s territories. 

Capital goods. Goods used in the production of other 

goods and services.

Commodification.  Transformation  of  goods  into 
undifferentiated products whose prices are increas-
ingly determined by greater application of a market 
mediation characterized as perfect competition.

Corporate social responsibility. Ethical and moral 
responsibilities that corporations have in addition 
to their responsibilities to comply with law and 
regulations.

Decoupling. Weakening or breaking the link between 
environmental  effects  and  economic  activity  so 
that output increases with a less than commensu-
rate increase (or with a decrease) in energy con-
sumption  (Von  Weizsäcker  1989;  Enevoldsen, 
Ryelund and Andersen 2007). Absolute decoup-
ling in industry is when the decrease in material, 
energy and pollution intensity is greater than the 
growth  rate  in  manufacturing  (OECD  2002; 
Spangenberg,  Omann  and  Hinterberger  2002). 
Relative  decoupling  is  when  the  growth  rate  of 
manufacturing value added is higher than that of 
industrial energy consumption.

Deindustrialization. Long-term decline in manufac-
turing relative to other sectors. Typically measured 
in terms of a share of manufacturing employment 
in total employment.

Elasticity.  Percent  change  in  one  due  to  1  percent 
change in another. For example, the growths of 
value added, employment and labour productivity 
as per unit increase in GDP per capita can be meas-
ured as percentage change in these variables due 
to 1 percentage point increase in GDP per capita. 
Income elasticity of demand is percentage change 

in demand due to 1 percentage point change in 
income.

Externalities. Costs or benefits that accrue to unre-
lated third parties. When it is a benefit reaped by 
third  parties,  it  is  called  a positive externality. 
When it is a cost imposed on third parties, it is 
called a negative externality. Externality is a mar-
ket failure that provides rational for industrial pol-
icy. Hausmann and Rodrik (2003, 2006) identify 
three main types of externalities that are particu-
larly relevant for new activities to emerge: coordi-
nation externalities, as specific new industries or 
activities require simultaneous, large investments 
to become profitable; information externalities, 
as “discovery” of new activities requires an invest-
ment whose returns cannot be fully appropriated 
by the investor; and labour training externalities, 
as firms regard labour mobility as a disincentive to 
invest in on-the-job training, thus reducing tech-
nological spillovers.

Gross cell product. A measure of geographical con-
centration, based on the output per area of 1 degree 
longitude by 1 degree latitude.

Induced effects. Impact on household spending due 

to changes in income. 

Industrial energy efficiency. The ratio of the useful 
or desired output of a process to the energy input 
into a process; for a higher aggregated level (sector, 
economy or global), the ratio of the amount of eco-
nomic activity produced from one unit of energy.

Industrial energy intensity. The amount of energy 
used  to  produce  one  unit  of  economic  activity 
across  all  sectors  of  an  economy;  related  to  the 
inverse of energy efficiency but only at the sectoral, 
economy or global level.

Industrial policy. Any type of intervention or govern-
ment policy that attempts to improve the business 
environment or to alter the structure of economic 
activity towards sectors, technologies or tasks that 
are expected to offer better prospects for economic 

xv

growth or societal welfare than would occur in the 
absence of such intervention – that is, in the mar-
ket equilibrium (Warwick 2013).

Informal economy. It is part of the economy that is 
operated outside the purview of government, thus 
not taxed and included in statistics.

Input-output  multiplier  effects.  Effects  leading 
to  an  increase  in  output,  which  is  greater  than 
the amount of initial final demand. For example, 
demand for 100 vehicles would increase total out-
put of the economy greater than the value of 100 
vehicles because the demand increases not only the 
output of direct inputs to vehicle production but 
also the output of indirect inputs (inputs to sup-
pliers, inputs to the suppliers’ suppliers and so on).
Intermediate goods. Goods used as inputs in the pro-

duction of other goods and services 

Labour intensity. Relative proportion of labour used 
in production. It is approximated in this report as 
the number of employment per unit of value added.
Manufacturing-related service / producer-related 
service.  Service  activities  whose  demands 
arise  largely  from  manufacturing  production. 
Wholesale, retail, transportation services for goods 
and business services (including, for example, rent-
ing services of machinery and equipment, research 
and development, and computer and related ser-
vices) are considered major components of manu-
facturing-related services. 

Manufacturing value added. See value added.
Non-manufacturing  industries.  Industries  that 
comprise mining and quarrying, construction and 
public utilities (electricity, gas and water).

Purchasing  power  parity  (PPP).  A  concept  that 
determines the relative values of two currencies in 
terms of purchasing power. PPP-based GDP shows 
what goods and services produced in one country 
would cost if they were sold in the United States. 
Since non-tradable services of similar quality are 
priced lower in low-income countries than they are 
in the United States, their PPP-based GDPs usu-
ally become higher than their GDPs based on mar-
ket exchange rates. 

Private return to education. Private rate of returns to 
education is calculated using after-tax earnings dif-
ferentials and only those educational costs actually 
borne by the student or their family (Amin and 
Awung 2005).

Process innovation. Innovation that alters the system 

of production to reduce costs or improve quality.

Product innovation. Innovation that alters the prod-
uct mix by creating either genuinely new products 
or products adapted from existing designs.

Skill-biased  technological  change.  Technological 
change that does not lead to proportional change 
in the demand for unskilled and skilled labour but 
results in greater demand for skilled labour.

Social  return  to  education.  Social  rates  of  return 
are based on before-tax earnings differentials or 
total earnings and the total resources the society 
incurred on education (Amin and Awung 2005).
Structural change. Change in the long-term compo-
sition and distribution of economic activities. A 
normative perspective of structural change often 
emphasizes desirability in the direction of change. 
For example, Ocampo (2005), Ocampo and Vos 
(2008) and UNDESA (2006a) define structural 
change as the ability of an economy to continu-
ally generate new dynamic activities characterized 
by higher productivity and increasing returns to 
scale.

Technological levels of manufacturing industries. 
Manufacturing  industries  can  be  grouped  into 
three technological categories – low tech, medium 
tech and high tech. They are based on research and 
development intensity relative to value added and 
production, following the technology classification 
of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation 
and Development (OECD 2005). In this report 
high tech and medium-high tech of the OECD 
classification are combined and called high tech, 
and medium-low tech industry of the OECD clas-
sification is called medium tech. 

Total factor productivity. A variable that represents 
the amount of output not accounted for by the 
amount of factor inputs, such as labour and capital.

Unit labour costs. Cost of labour per unit of output. 
It is calculated as the ratio of labour costs to real 
output.

Value added. A measure of output net of interme-
diate consumption, which includes the value of 
materials and supplies used in production, fuels 
and electricity consumed, the cost of industrial 

services such as payments for contract and com-
mission work and repair and maintenance, com-
pensation  of  employees,  operating  surplus  and 
consumption  of  fixed  capital.  Manufacturing 
valued added is the contribution of the entire 
manufacturing  sector  to  GDP  (manufacturing 
net output).

Executive summary
Sustaining employment growth: 
The role of manufacturing 
and structural change

Industrial structural change and employment

Key messages
•  Manufacturing – with around 470 million jobs in 2009, or one in six jobs globally – still matters for employment gen-

eration. In 2013, there likely are more than half billion jobs in manufacturing.

•  Manufacturing employment is rising in developing countries and falling in developed countries, but the declines in 

developed countries are mitigated by the growth of manufacturing-related services.

•  least developed countries have immense potential for industrialization in food and beverages (agroindustry), and 

textiles and garments, with good prospects for sustained employment generation and higher productivity.

•  Middle-income countries can benefit from entering the basic and fabricated metals industries, which offer a range of 
products necessary for investment and are demanded by the more advanced industries and which are facing rapidly 
growing international demand.

•  developed countries have great possibilities for investing and innovating in high-tech industries and for sustaining 

jobs in these industries’ related services. 
Industrialization improves not only the number of jobs but also their quality in all countries.

• 
•  Manufacturing concentrates in cities at early stages of development and “suburbanizes” at later stages. Cities thus 

remain crucial for industrialization in developing countries.

Jobs do not fall like manna from heaven. They arise 
from the process of economic development and from 
the efforts of entrepreneurs and governments to gener-
ate new enterprises and economic activities. Sustained 
job creation requires structural change, that is, the 
ability  of  an  economy  to  constantly  generate  new 
fast-growing activities characterized by higher value 
added and productivity as well as increasing returns 
to scale. Manufacturing offers greater opportunities 
than other sectors to accumulate capital, exploit econ-
omies of scale, acquire new technologies and – more 
fundamentally  – foster embodied and disembodied 
technological change. It is thus the core of economic 
growth and structural transformation.

Since  the  industrial  revolution,  manufactur-
ing  has  driven  output  and  employment,  sparked 
by  improvements  in  mechanization  and  leading  to 
unprecedented incomes. The higher incomes have led 
to greater demand for manufactured products and a 
relative  decline  in  spending  on  agricultural  goods. 
Productivity gains raised demand further as the prices 
of manufactures declined even more relative to those 
of  other  goods  and  services.  Accompanying  these 

changes were major labour force and population shifts 
from agriculture and rural areas into manufacturing 
and urban areas, and later into services.

The  role  of  manufacturing  changes  as  structural 
change evolves. At lower incomes the application of low 
capital-intensive technologies allows for improvements 
in both productivity and employment. As the capital 
intensity  of  technology  increases,  productivity  gains 
dominate and employment shifts towards manufactur-
ing-related and other services. Manufacturing remains 
an important employer, with around 470 million jobs 
worldwide in 2009 – or around 16 percent of the world’s 
workforce of 2.9 billion – a figure far higher than many 
might expect (Figure S1). Manufacturing must therefore 
have more than half a billion jobs in 2013.

For  developing  countries  aiming  to  maintain 
growth while sustaining job creation, manufacturing 
offers an opportunity not only to re-balance the econ-
omy towards higher value-added sectors but also to 
provide a relatively wide employment base with higher 
than average labour productivity. This contrasts with 
a direct transition from agriculture to services, espe-
cially  for  low-income  countries.  Services  offer  the

Note: The total informal jobs before 1995 were extrapolated based on the formal-informal ratio for 1995, because there are a far larger number of missing values in country data before 1995. This made 
it impossible to estimate the informal employment of individual countries and sum them up to derive total informal jobs before 1995.

opportunity to achieve only the first objective, not the 
second. Least developed countries, mainly in Africa, 
have openings in low-tech labour intensive industries 
like agroindustry, textiles and apparel (see also Lin 
2012). Middle income countries could benefit from 
entering  medium-tech  industries  such  as  basic  and 
fabricated metals. Although they do not generate large 
amounts of employment they are high-productivity 
industries and can generate resources for investment. 
Their products include steel, bricks, cement, boilers, 
metallic structures, hand tools and plastics, most of 
them  intermediate  goods  in  high  demand  by  more 
advanced  industries  and  enjoying  growing  interna-
tional demand. Manufacturing also offers the poten-
tial to boost wages and incomes, helping to create a 
domestic market.

The impact of manufacturing structural change on 
employment also has a spatial dimension. Shifts in the 
relative shares of industries go hand in hand with geo-
graphical shifts in the location of people, often driven 
by trade. Historically manufacturing moved from the 
United Kingdom to Continental Europe and to the 

United States and later to Japan. Today it is moving 
towards East Asia, including the Republic of Korea 
and mainland China. Yet employment is not equally 
distributed between emerging and traditional indus-
trial  powerhouses.  And  within  countries  manufac-
turing is usually more geographically concentrated in 
cities during the structural change from agriculture to 
manufacturing, reflecting agglomeration economies. 
However, this trend has reversed somewhat in devel-
oped economies – which are “suburbanizing” – as ser-
vices become more important.

The  impact  of  within-manufacturing  structural 
change – the shift from low-, to medium-, to high-
technology  industries  –  on  employment  varies  by 
type  of  industry.  Low-tech  industries  produce  vast 
employment opportunities and some possibilities for 
capital accumulation. Medium- and high-tech indus-
tries offer opportunities for capital accumulation but 
generate less employment than do low-tech industries. 
High-tech industries offer, in addition, openings for 
innovation and new knowledge and skill development 
and thus the capacity to invent new industries and

up the structural change ladder, 
manufacturing will continue to contribute 
to the quality of employment by

opportunities for female employment

restart the structural change cycle. It is these capaci-
ties to accumulate capital and to innovate, alongside a 
growing division of labour of service activities, which 
produce employment opportunities.

In developed countries, manufacturing remains an 
engine of growth in that it is the main source of finan-
cial and knowledge resources for sustaining growth 
and (to some extent) for creating jobs. But the bulk 

of new jobs are in the services for further developing 
manufacturing and for producing industrial goods. 
It is difficult to conceive of these activities as separate 
from manufacturing. As developing countries move 
up the structural change ladder, manufacturing will 
continue to contribute to the quality of employment 
by improving wages and by providing wider opportu-
nities for female employment.

Drivers of structural change in manufacturing

Key messages
•  Costs, as well as technology and demand, remain critical drivers of structural change and industrial development.
•  Matching the type of skills to the structure of industry as incomes grow can drive industrial structural change.
•  Product innovation results in structural transformation and generates employment through the creation of new busi-

ness opportunities.

•  resource efficiency, emerging as a major driver of structural change and industrial development, will be even more 

important in the future.

•  the impact of the drivers of structural change on sustaining employment depends on the industrial policies adopted.

Traditional and emerging drivers
The previous section depicted structural change across 
sectors and within manufacturing industry and the 
relationship to employment. But what are the drivers 
of this structural change? And how do they sustain 
employment through structural change? Certainly the 
interactions are extremely diverse, complex and non-
linear. This section discusses the reasons for structural 
change in manufacturing.

In  principle,  structural  change  in  any  sector  in 
any country is governed by the conditions of demand 
and  supply  for  products  and  services  that  interact 
with  each  other.  Supply-side  conditions  generally 
include wages, skills, technological change, industrial 
organization and the overall business environment, 
which also determine the competitiveness of industry. 
Demand-side conditions include demand for imports 
and exports as well as foreign direct investment (FDI). 
Often,  some  of  these  drivers  work  through  both 
demand and supply.

Wages  are  both  a  constraint  on  and  a  result  of 
the  process  of  structural  transformation.  They  are 

a constraint in that high wages may push investors 
away from a project, particularly in labour-intensive 
industries, although most investors do not take invest-
ment  decisions  on  wages  alone  but  also  look  into 
other factors like productivity, infrastructure, logisti-
cal facilities and supplies (cost and availability). Too 
high wages may prompt a withdrawal of investment, 
leading  to  deindustrialization  and  falling  employ-
ment, while attractive wages may generate more and 
new work opportunities. Wages are also a result of the 
process of structural change – as workers move up to 
higher value-added industries and raise their produc-
tivity, they receive higher salaries.

Skills need to be attuned to the structure of the 
industry  and  change  over  time  as  industrialization 
proceeds (Table S1). Most sophisticated industrial sec-
tors require different types of skills than less advanced 
ones.  Advanced  industries  require  highly  special-
ized manufacturing skills with a focus on technical 
subjects  such  as  engineering  and  mathematics  and 
strong technical and vocational education and train-
ing.  Intermediate  industries  require  a  low  base  of

engineering and scientific skills, and early industries 
need  literacy,  numeracy  and  simple  technical  and 
managerial training. However, as these set of skills 
are cumulative, it takes time to build the skill base for 
structural transformation.

Improvements  in  technology  raise  productivity 
and hence are a major driver of structural change, yet 
their effect on employment is negative as they normally 
increase the capital intensity of industry and reduce 
labour needs. More generally, however, innovation usu-
ally favours structural change through shifts in produc-
tion processes and the generation of new products (and 
eventually  industries),  but  their  impact  on  employ-
ment varies. Most process innovation aims to increase 
efficiency or save on inputs and so reduce labour, but 
product innovation (by creating new business oppor-
tunities) normally leads to more jobs. What matters for 
employment is the net effect of both dimensions.

The organization of industry affects processes of 
structural transformation through a mix of firm size; 

extent of economies of scale in production; degree of 
production  fragmentation  across  value  chains;  and 
the  nature  of  spatial  distribution  and  clustering  of 
production within national economies. An industrial 
organization geared towards large firms and sectors 
will make it harder for the economy to shift to more 
advanced industries, while a more balanced combina-
tion, which includes a significant proportion of small 
and  medium-sized  enterprises,  may  allow  for  more 
economic flexibility and potential for advancement as 
well as generate more employment.

International  trade  promotes  structural  trans-
formation  through  demand-side  effects  including 
expanding the size and scope of local business, which 
do not need to rely solely on the domestic market to 
grow further. Supply-side effects include the poten-
tial for substituting imports as local producers cap-
ture  markets  initially  served  by  imports;  exposing 
local  firms  to  foreign  competition  and  technology, 
which may lead to significant productivity gains; the 

44

higher-tech, from lower value-added to higher 
value-added, and from lower-productivity to 
higher-productivity sectors, industries and 
activities if they want to develop industrially

possibility  of  capturing  valuable  externalities  and 
dynamic returns to scale; and by generating opportu-
nities for attracting additional FDI. Yet the evidence 
suggests  that  the  impact  of  international  trade  is 
ambiguous and depends on additional economic and 
policy conditions.

Global value chains (GVCs) help structural trans-
formation by segmenting the production process and 
facilitating the relocation of production. In produc-
ing a final product in one location, there may be little 
scope for changing the capital–labour ratio, but once it 
becomes possible to fragment production into a series 
of stages there will inevitably be some that are more 
labour intensive than others and, with low transport 
and communication costs, it may be cost effective to 
locate these in a low-wage economy. Technologically, 
participating in value chains makes industrialization 
“easier and faster” but at the same time locally “less 
meaningful”, as firms in developing countries can link 
to international production networks and draw on the 
technological and marketing prowess of the lead firms 
in these chains while not making the effort themselves 
(Baldwin  forthcoming).  GVCs’  impact  on  employ-
ment tends to be positive, though it also depends on 
whether local production has been displaced.

FDI influences structural change by encouraging 
the development of clusters and exploitation of cluster 
economies (when domestic investment is unavailable). 
It promotes diversification into new sectors, particu-
larly when it is attracted to new high-tech sectors, and 
through spillover effects, which make local firms more 
competitive and attract local firms into new activities. 
FDI does not, however, automatically generate struc-
tural change, as spillovers only work if local entrepre-
neurs are involved.

Resource constraints have traditionally not been 
a driver of structural change but, given the polluting 
impact of industrialization in the past, environmen-
tal protection will become a key driver in the future. 
Further, wasteful production and consumption pat-
terns – along with continued soil degradation, defor-
estation  and  overfishing  –  are  already  exacerbating 
water shortages and escalating prices for food, energy 

and other commodities. Efficient use of inputs, there-
fore, has clear economic advantages, boosting com-
petitiveness and generating resources for investing in 
further growth and structural transformation.

Drivers as necessary conditions
As said at the start of this report, jobs do not fall like 
manna from heaven – and neither of course is struc-
tural change imposed this way. Yet one of the key 
themes of this report is that countries need to move 
from lower- to higher-tech, from lower value-added 
to higher value-added, and from lower-productivity 
to higher-productivity sectors, industries and activi-
ties if they want to develop industrially. The struc-
tural change analysis for this report indicates that 
while conditions may vary greatly across time and 
space and that technological change may still throw 
up huge surprises, the regularities from the past are 
very likely to stretch into the future. There is much 
to learn from understanding history and what drove 
it. And developing countries can learn much from 
countries that are ahead of them – far ahead or even 
just slightly.

The impact of drivers on structural change, how-
ever,  has  not  been,  and  will  not  be,  unambiguous. 
Wages can support – or hinder – employment genera-
tion depending on how they are set. The timing of the 
availability of skills seems to be crucially important 
to  support  the  emergence  of  new  jobs.  Technology 
sheds  labour  if  it  is  process  oriented  but  generates 
labour if it is product oriented. International trade 
does not always lead to a virtuous circle of structural 
change and employment, as the contrasting experi-
ences  of  East  Asia  and  Latin  America  illustrate.  A 
simple examination of each of the drivers will reveal 
that their impact may go in either direction, which is 
complicated by the fact that drivers often interact with 
each other before generating an impact.

The state (alongside the private sector) needs to 
work hard at ensuring that the drivers have a posi-
tive impact on employment generation while trans-
forming the economy. Through government policy 
targeting  key  drivers,  such  as  education  and  skills,

“ By promoting positive structural change at 

all development stages and by overseeing close 
coordination with other policies so that there is 
consistency in action, governments can have a 
major impact on sustaining employment generation

appropriability  and/or  international  trade,  govern-
ments  can  set  in  motion  a  virtuous  rather  than  a 
vicious circle involving structural change. Well-run 
interventions  can  promote  industrial  growth  and 
employment,  as  confirmed  by  the  results  of  recent 
impact evaluations for high-income countries. By pro-
moting positive structural change at all development 
stages  and  by  overseeing  close  coordination  with 
other policies so that there is consistency in action, 

governments can have a major impact on sustaining 
employment  generation.  But  developing  countries 
should  not  simply  emulate  high-income  countries, 
and  may  well  benefit  from  showing  flexibility  in 
experimenting, learning and evaluating.

Drivers are thus necessary conditions for successful 
structural change but will require a good set of well-
coordinated  government  policies  in  order  to  make 
industrialization work for employment generation.

National and international industrial policy

Key messages
•  achieving sustained employment generation requires industrial policies to focus on the structural transformation of 

the economy.

•  the state can promote industrial policy either as a regulator, financier, producer or consumer. It should oversee 
close coordination with other policies as they can undermine the objectives of industrial policy if they are misaligned.

•  For industrial policy to be effective, the policy-making process is as important as the policy content.
• 

International cooperation in the areas of labour standards, investment and sustainable economic development tar-
gets after 2015 is key to ensure that industrialization generates much needed high-quality jobs.

Promoting structural change
Industrial policy – the main objective of which is to 
“anticipate structural change, facilitating it by remov-
ing  obstacles  and  correcting  for  market  failures” 
(Syrquin 2007) – should seek to promote such change 
at each stage of development, in four main ways: as a 
regulator establishing tariffs, fiscal incentives or subsi-
dies; as a financier influencing the credit market and 
allocating  public  and  private  financial  resources  to 
industrial projects; as a producer participating directly 
in economic activity through, for example, state enter-
prises; and as a consumer guaranteeing a market for 
strategic industries through public procurement pro-
grammes (Peres and Primi 2009).

At an early stage of industrialization (from agri-
culture  to  low-technology  manufacturing),  indus-
trial policy should primarily aim to align agricultural 
and industrial policies and create or support labour- 
intensive and resource-based manufacturing with low 
entry barriers; towards the middle-income stage, by 
improving manufacturing’s efficiency and productivity 

and through diversifying and upgrading the economic 
structure; and at an advanced stage through technolog-
ical innovation, pursuing both differentiation by rais-
ing quality and innovation by launching new products 
and services, including green technology.

Targeting key drivers of structural change
The  state  can  use  policy  instruments  to  target  key 
drivers. Education and skills, for example, would be 
underprovided in a pure market-driven environment 
as employers have too few incentives to provide funds 
for  them.  Similarly,  limited  appropriability,  lack  of 
competitive finance and coordination failures make 
technology and innovation prone to market failures, 
resulting  in  underinvestment  (Martin  and  Scott 
2000). And as a reliable supply system of low-cost and 
high-quality material inputs is critical to local indus-
tries, countries sometimes use policy instruments to 
reduce input costs.

The targeting of key drivers requires close coordi-
nation with other policies – notably on competition,

“ Coordination is particularly important 

because competition and industrial policies 
are often viewed as mutually conflicting

trade  and  FDI,  and  exchange  rates  –  that  play  an 
important complementary role to industrial policy. 
Failure  to  ensure  synergies  may  counteract  policy 
objectives.  Coordination  is  particularly  important 
because competition and industrial policies are often 
viewed as mutually conflicting, as the former typically 
aims to foster rivalry between firms in an industry (for 
greater efficiency and economic welfare), while the lat-
ter frequently gives a market advantage over competi-
tors to favoured domestic sectors or industries.

Coordination  among  trade  and  FDI  policies 
helped,  for  example,  former  low-income  countries 
such as the Republic of Korea to catch up, and today 
despite restrictions imposed by bi- and multilateral 
trade policy agreements, governments still have some 
space to use trade-related instruments for industrial 
policy,  especially  non-tariff  barriers  (Chang  2003). 
They can also use export-promotion instruments that 
support  exporters’  access  to  competitive  financing, 
research and development (R&D) and training.

Measures  such  as  close  monitoring  of  the  real 
exchange rate and keeping it undervalued to support 
the tradable sector, primarily manufacturing (includ-
ing manipulation of the nominal exchange rate), have 
featured in almost all successful catch-up countries 
(for example, Rodrik 2008a). They are also crucial in 
preventing the current account deficit from becoming 
unsustainable (McCombie and Thirlwall 2004).

Developing skills
Most governments agree that human capital is a cru-
cial driver of economic growth. Some of the elements 
in successful skill policies are: appreciating the com-
plexity of industrial skill needs; matching short-term 
needs and long-term goals; creating skills gradually 
and sequentially; matching supply and demand; and 
aligning  skill  policies  with  the  broader  socio-eco-
nomic agenda.

At the “hard end”, manufacturing employers are 
not just looking for technical skills but also for cogni-
tive, social and behavioural skills. Some consider team 
work and problem solving key for blue-collar workers, 
and critical thinking crucial for white-collar workers 

(Bodewig 2012). Many of these soft skills have to be 
developed at an early age, hence the importance of 
supporting policies that establish the learning founda-
tions of the future workforce. Beyond that stage, the 
last few decades have seen a strong emphasis on tech-
nical and vocational education and training (TVET) 
to meet the demand for industrial skills. Private sec-
tor  involvement  –  through,  for  example,  inter-firm 
linkages and university–private sector collaboration, 
including on-the-job training – is crucial because this 
is the most efficient way to link skills to the labour 
market (DFID 2011).

Still,  lack  of  financing  for  high-quality  TVET 
remains a bottleneck, but it remains important to pro-
duce training for the informal sector, both to develop 
that sector and to strengthen the link between the 
informal  and  formal  sectors,  making  it  easier  for 
workers to move to the latter.

Getting industrial policy to work
Carefully chosen and implemented interventions can 
promote industrial growth and employment, as con-
firmed by evidence from the results of impact evalua-
tions for high-income countries published in 2010 and 
2012. For instance, subsidies to manufacturing firms 
can increase employment at comparably very low cost 
per job (Criscuolo et al. 2012). Well-allocated firm-
level subsidies can also boost total factor productivity 
(Aghion et al. 2012), and tariffs that account for the 
varying skill levels among industries have the potential 
to boost economic growth (Nunn and Trefler 2010).

These types of studies must be interpreted with 
great  caution,  however.  First,  many  were  not  per-
formed thoroughly enough and hence an assessment 
of their internal validity suggests that causal relation-
ships  between  policy  instruments  and  observable 
impacts are hard to establish. Second, the findings on 
the achievements or failures that can be distilled from 
international experiences cannot easily be generalized 
because of country heterogeneity.

One upshot, though, is that evidence-based and 
realistic  industrial  policy  run  in  a  consensual  way, 
which  is  key  for  effectiveness,  irrespective  of  the

“ Each country has to go through its own 

learning process – combining industrial 
policy experimentation with rigorous impact 
evaluation to generate an evidence base on

concrete instruments used. Thus those making such 
policy should:
•  Use – do not fight – the political system. A fact of 
political life is that no policy will be underwritten 
unless those in power agree to it.

•  Strengthen  political  leadership.  This  will  set  a 
national transformation agenda that aims, in low-
income countries, to create and nurture produc-
tive activities or, in middle-income countries, to 
advance technologically.

•  Encourage public–private dialogue. This will help 
both in designing interventions that draw on expert 
knowledge in the private sector and in ensuring 
that all key stakeholders support decisions.

•  Boost  industrial  policy  management  capabilities. 
These have to be strengthened considerably among 
key actors in developing countries in a pragmatic 
and concentrated way.
International experience with policy instruments 
can provide interesting lessons, but developing coun-
tries are unlikely to succeed with simple emulation of 
high-income economies because a strategic approach to 
forming industrial policy has to be tailored to national 
circumstances.  Each  country  has  to  go  through  its 
own learning process – combining industrial policy 
experimentation with rigorous impact evaluation to 
generate an evidence base on which industrial policy 
measures work, and which do not, in a given context.

Cooperating internationally
International  cooperation  on  structural  change  is 
required to prevent any “race to the bottom”, where 
firms in rich countries could be tempted to relocate 
to low-income countries with lower labour costs, less 
restrictive  labour  laws,  and  weaker  monitoring  of 
labour conditions and environmental impacts. At the 
same time, to address these challenges, national regu-
lators need a measure of policy autonomy, a position 
that may be at odds with international cooperation 
through trade agreements.

Cooperation is also required for the fairly new area 
of “private sustainability standards”, which emerged 
once social activists discovered that reputation was 
a  firm’s  tangible  asset  that  they  could  easily  harm. 
Another key legal instrument for international coop-
eration is the bilateral investment treaty, which can 
allay concerns of expropriation.

As the world examines how to move beyond the 
Millennium  Development  Goals  after  2015,  it  can 
look to build a framework with goals anchored in the 
three  dimensions  –  economic,  social  and  environ-
mental – of sustainable development. Generating new 
employment is a pivotal global social concern as well 
as challenge, and the post-2015 agenda offers a new 
opportunity for states to recouple considerations for 
sustainable manufacturing and employment with the 
focus on human development.

Trends in manufacturing valued added and in manufactured exports

Manufacturing value added
The  world’s  manufacturing  value  added  (MVA) 
reached an all-time high of $8,900 billion in 2012 
(16.7 percent of global GDP), recovering fully from 
the sharp contraction of 2008–2009 caused by the 
global economic and financial crisis. MVA’s share in 
GDP in industrialized countries fell from 16.4 percent 
in 1990 to 15.0 percent in 2012, when it rose from 
16.5 percent to 21.3 percent in industrializing coun-
tries. (See Annex 8 for classification of industrialized 
and industrializing economies.)

Between 1992 and 2012 global MVA nearly dou-
bled, averaging 3 percent annual growth. While indus-
trialized countries’ MVA expanded by a mere 1.8 per-
cent a year, below their 2.1 percent GDP growth for 
the  period,  MVA  in  industrializing  countries  rose 
more  than  three-fold,  at  an  annual  rate  of  6.4  per-
cent, faster than their 5.0 percent GDP growth rate 
(Table S2). The outcome was a near-doubling in indus-
trializing countries’ share in world MVA, from 18 per-
cent in 1992 to 35 percent in 2012 and a mirroring 
retreat of industrialized countries from the world’s

manufacturing  scene,  underscoring  the  structural 
changes taking place in both groups.

Manufacturing in industrializing countries is geo-
graphically highly concentrated, with the five leading 
economies accounting for 70.9 percent of total produc-
tion in 2012, up from 52.7 percent in 1992. The high 
and sustained MVA growth in China over this period 
(11.4 percent on average) is behind its emergence as 
the factory of the world: in 2012, 50 percent of indus-
trializing-country manufactured goods was produced 
in China. Of all other large industrializing-economy 

manufacturers, only India (7.4 percent average annual 
MVA growth) kept pace with China’s expansion. It 
gained MVA share to become the second leading man-
ufacturer among industrializing economies, supersed-
ing Mexico and Brazil, which saw their MVA shares 
fall by more than half from 11.7 percent and 10.5 per-
cent in 1992 to 5.7 percent and 4.9 percent in 2012. 
Turkey’s steady MVA growth (4.5 percent on average 
a year over 1992–2012) enabled it to preserve its posi-
tion as the fifth largest manufacturer among industri-
alizing economies.

“ World exports grew by 6.4 percent 

annually between 2007 and 2011 to reach 
$16.7 trillion in 2011, more than 80 percent 
of it consisting of manufactured products

Manufactured exports
A feature of the current organization of manufacturing 
is the increased use of international production net-
works to carry out different stages of the production 
process across borders, made possible by large scales of 
production, advances in technology (especially micro-
electronics) and affordable transport costs.

The  result  of  this  production  sharing  has  been 
a  larger  increase  in  trade  than  the  corresponding 
increase in MVA. World exports grew by 6.4 percent 
annually between 2007 and 2011 to reach $16.7 tril-
lion in 2011, more than 80 percent of it consisting of 

manufactured  products.  In  the  same  period,  world 
output expanded on average by just 1.5 percent a year, 
as many countries were hit hard by the economic crisis 
in 2008–2009.

In  2011  world  manufactured  exports  peaked  at 
$13,469 billion, growing faster than MVA and GDP 
over 2007–2011 (Table S3). They recovered fully from 
the contraction that followed the crisis, due mainly to 
the expansion in exports from large industrializing 
countries such as China and India.

Industrialized  countries’  manufactured  exports 
grew  by  just  3.7  percent  annually  over  2007–2011,

economies is also reflected in the increase in 
their share in world manufactured exports, from 
13.9 percent in 1997 to 29.6 percent in 2011

reaching $9,483 billion in 2011, as they struggled to 
recover  from  the  dip  in  economic  activity  brought 
about by the crisis. In industrializing countries, manu-
factured exports grew by 10.5 percent annually over 
the same period, to a peak of $3,985 billion in 2011.

The higher dynamism of industrializing economies 
is also reflected in the increase in their share in world 
manufactured exports, from 13.9 percent in 1997 to 
29.6 percent in 2011. It was the emerging economies, 
including China and 31 other fast-growing, high and 
higher  MVA  per  capita  economies,  that  accounted 

for most of this increase, their world share more than 
doubling from 12.3 percent in 1997 to 27.1 percent in 
2011.

Together,  the  combined  manufactured  exports 
of the largest country in each industrializing region 
–  China,  India,  Mexico,  Poland,  South  Africa  and 
Turkey – accounted for 67.5 percent of the industrial-
izing countries’ total in 2011, up from 59.9 percent in 
2002 and 55.1 percent in 1997, confirming the higher 
dynamism of the larger countries and a worrying wid-
ening gap with the smaller economies.

Section 1 

Industrial structural change and manufacturing employment

Ever  since  the  industrial  revolution,  manufactur-
ing  has  been  the  “engine  of  growth”  for  output 
and  employment,  sparked  by  major  technological 
change  and  mechanization  and  leading  to  unprec-
edented  and  sustained  long-term  economic  growth 
and  rising  incomes.  The  higher  incomes  led  to  an 
increase in demand for manufactured products and 
a relative decline in spending on agricultural goods. 
Productivity gains raised demand further as prices of 
manufactures declined even further relative to other 
goods and services. Accompanying these changes were 
major labour force and population shifts from agri-
culture and rural areas, initially into manufacturing 
and to urban areas, and later into services. This self-
reinforcing industrial development process lasted for 
decades, if not centuries, as a result of which what have 
become today’s developed economies generated hun-
dreds of millions of jobs in industry.

Indeed,  manufacturing  still  matters  greatly  for 
employment today: broadly defined to include formal 
and  informal  activities  and  manufacturing-related 

services, it accounted for around 470 million jobs in 
2009 – or one out of six jobs on the planet.

In this first section, three chapters look at the ele-
ments that make manufacturing an engine of growth. 
Chapter  1  analyses  the  trends  of  structural  change 
(also called structural transformation) over the last 
50 years. Chapter 2 then focuses on spatial differences 
among countries and regions, and within countries. 
And Chapter 3 looks more closely at structural change 
in manufacturing itself.

Some key findings are that manufacturing employ-
ment is growing in developing countries and decreas-
ing  in  developed  countries,  though  that  decline  is 
mitigated by growing manufacturing-related services 
employment. And while many developing countries 
have  immense  potential  to  industrialize  in  agroin-
dustry, textiles and garments – industries that offer 
prospects for sustained employment generation and 
productivity gains – developed countries have great 
scope for pursuing high-tech innovation and sustain-
ing related services jobs.

Chapter 1
Structural change and 
employment trends

This chapter attempts to make sense of the trends of 
structural  change  over  the  last  50  years.  Structural 
change unfolds over time but is best analysed through 
the structure of countries’ economies with the same 
income level, even if that is attained at different points 
in time. The structural change of an economy is not 
just associated with the growth of that economy, but 
lies at its very core, because it corresponds to a tran-
sition from lower to higher productivity sectors. Up 
to roughly the income level of advanced economies, 
one can grasp such a transition by looking at shifts 
from one sector to another (mainly from agriculture 
to industry and services), but at higher incomes, aver-
age employment-to-output ratios converge and further 
evidence of structural change can only be seen within 
sectors.

For  developing  countries  aiming  to  maintain 
growth while creating sustainable jobs, manufactur-
ing offers an opportunity not only to rebalance the 
economy  towards  higher  value-added  sectors  but 
also  to  provide  a  relatively  wide  employment  base 
with higher labour productivity. This contrasts with 
a direct transition from agriculture to services, espe-
cially  for  low-income  countries,  which  offers  the 
opportunity to achieve only the first objective, not the 
second. Manufacturing can be an important absorber 
of labour while paying above-average wages.

The  employment  effect  of  manufacturing  is 
stronger  than  conventional  statistics  derived  from 
industry  surveys  suggest,  which  usually  count  only 
formal sector jobs in firms above a certain size and 
exclude self-employed and unregistered workers. Nor 
do those statistics cover manufacturing-related jobs in 
services, notably those jobs that have been unbundled 
from manufacturing and that statistically used to be 
counted  in  manufacturing  but  are  now  in  services. 
At most, the conventional data caught half the total 
number of jobs directly and indirectly created by man-
ufacturing, but when the sector is broadly defined to 
include formal, informal and manufacturing-related 

services, manufacturing worldwide in 2009 provided 
almost 470 million jobs, employing around 16 per-
cent of the world’s workforce of 2.9 billion, a figure far 
higher than many commentators might expect.

The quality of jobs – wages, conditions of work 
and rates of female employment – is also an important 
contribution  of  manufacturing.  The  chapter  closes 
with a review of manufacturing’s comparative perfor-
mance in these areas.

Industrialization, structural change 
and economic growth

Industrialization in the long run
The United Kingdom in the 18th century was the first 
country to develop manufacturing. Only in the early 
19th century (after the United Kingdom had already 
demonstrated  significant  increases  in  productivity) 
did Belgium, France and Switzerland, followed by the 
United States, enter their own paths of manufacturing 
development. After this a few other latecomers (notably 
Germany, Japan and Russia) joined the group of indus-
trializing nations, while the developing world (colonies 
and non-colonies) remained oriented towards primary 
production (Gerschenkron 1962; Maddison 2007).

This sustained process lasted for decades, even cen-
turies, for the United Kingdom (Box 1.1), with data 
suggesting that manufacturing jobs in factories grew 
from around 22 percent of total employment in 1841 
to more than 35 percent in 1960 (Matthews, Feinstein 
and Odling-Smee 1982). In the United States – where 
data can be traced back even further – manufactur-
ing employment grew from around 6 percent of total 
employment in 1800 to around 36 percent in 1960, 
a  period  when  the  population  increased  33-fold. 
Moreover, not only did the rate of employment rise, 
but its quality in terms of wages, labour conditions 
and skill levels also improved.

At the start of the 20th century, the world economy 
was already divided into industrial rich economies and

Manufacturing has been the engine of growth for out-
put and employment since the industrial revolution. the 
mechanization of manually based economic activities  
– such as the production of textiles or iron making – 
as well as increasing power generation, and growing 
regional and international trade facilitated by improve-
ments in transport, led to unprecedented, sustained 
long-term economic growth and rising incomes. Con-
tinually rising incomes, in turn, led to greater demand 
for manufactured products and relatively lower outlays 
on agricultural goods.

the  manufacturing  industry  began  to  benefit 
from scale factors and from continued technological 
change, resulting in a rapid rise in productivity. Produc-
tivity gains raised demand as prices of manufactures 
declined even further relative to other goods and ser-
vices. Manufacturing employment initially grew in the 
newly mechanized economic activities as unit costs of 
labour fell. later, as the income elasticity of demand 
for  textiles  and  iron  products  decreased  and  their 
capital intensity grew, labour shifted to other emerging 
industries, which saw rising demand and productivity 
growth. accompanying these trends were major labour 
force and population shifts from agriculture and rural 
areas, initially into manufacturing and to urban areas, 
and later into services.

agricultural  poor  economies.  Industrialization  had 
become  synonymous  with  wealth,  economic  devel-
opment,  technological  leadership,  political  power 
and  international  dominance  (Szirmai,  Naudé  and 
Alcorta 2013). Countries failing to industrialize or, 
even more significantly, countries experiencing dein-
dustrialization, such as India prior to independence, 
were perceived to be on an unsustainable development 
trajectory.

After World War II more countries began to enter 
the catch-up phase, thanks to the greater opportuni-
ties for technology transfer and the industrial policies 
of  “developmental  states”.  Countries  that  failed  to 
maintain robust growth of the manufacturing sector 
or where industrial policies were deliberately reversed, 
as in Latin America, failed to keep the momentum

Structural change and economic 
development
A large body of empirical evidence shows that manu-
facturing  can  be  catalytic  in  transforming  the  eco-
nomic structure of agrarian societies. In fact, the very 
concept  of  economic  development  is  intrinsically 
linked to the changes in the structure of economic 
activity that take place as countries become richer.

But the concept of structural change is open to 
many interpretations and has been used extensively in 
the literature without a clear consensus on its mean-
ing.  From  a  strictly  positive  perspective,  structural 
change would be defined as any long-term change in 
the composition of an aggregate. This would typically 
refer to the relative importance of sectors in the econ-
omy or to changes in the location of economic activity 
(Syrquin 2010).

The term has also been approached from a norma-
tive  perspective  that  emphasizes  desirability  in  the 
direction  of  change.  Desirability  might  be  defined 
according to different sectoral characteristics, among 
which  the  level  and  dynamism  of  productivity  and 
the scope for technological opportunities are typically 
the most important. Authors such as Ocampo (2005), 
Ocampo  and  Vos  (2008)  and  UNDESA  (2006a) 
define structural change as the ability of an economy 
to constantly generate new dynamic activities charac-
terized by higher productivity and increasing returns 
to scale. On this second approach, structural change 
emerges as a central feature of the development pro-
cess and an essential element in explaining the rate and 
pattern of growth. It can impede growth if its pace is 
too slow or its direction inefficient but can contribute 
to growth if it improves the allocation of resources 
(Syrquin 2010). As Justin Yifu Lin points out: “All 
countries  that  remain  poor  have  failed  to  achieve 
structural change, that is, they have been unable to 
diversify away from agriculture and the production of 
traditional goods into manufacturing and other mod-
ern activities” (Lin 2012, p. 3).

1“ All countries that remain poor have been 

unable to diversify away from agriculture 
and the production of traditional goods into 
manufacturing and other modern activities

In the rest of this subsection we will stick to the 
first, positive definition and analyse the patterns of 
the last half century, looking exclusively at the chang-
ing  contribution  to  gross  domestic  product  (GDP) 
of the major sectors: agriculture, non-manufacturing 
industries,1 manufacturing industries and services. In 
the next subsection we will focus on manufacturing’s 
role in economic development, and therefore interpret 
structural change from the normative perspective, as 
the  reallocation  of  resources  from  low-productivity 
activities towards manufacturing.

A first approach is to analyse the changing impor-
tance of these four sectors’ shares in GDP at different 
points in time for different countries (Table 1.1).

The last two rows provide a general impression of 
the main trends of structural change over the last half 
century in 68 developing and 21 advanced economies.
In 1950 almost 40 percent of developing countries’ 
GDP originated in agriculture and only 12 percent in 
manufacturing. Fifty-five years later the share of agri-
culture had dropped to just 16 percent of GDP. In the 
interim, manufacturing industries had first increased 
their share in GDP (peaking at around 17 percent in 
the early 1980s) but that share later fell. Throughout 
these years services showed a steady increase, gaining 
more than 10 percentage points.

In  contrast,  in  1950  advanced  economies  were 
already  based  heavily  on  manufacturing  (at  almost 
30  percent  of  GDP)  and  agriculture  accounted  for 
only a minor share (16 percent). These economies, too, 
became much more services oriented, but manufactur-
ing showed a steady decline and by 2005 it had almost 
the same share as in developing countries.

One feature that stands out in Table 1.1 is the wide 
variety of patterns, even within developing countries. 
At mid-century in China, Indonesia, the Republic of 
Korea, Malaysia and Thailand, for example, agricul-
ture accounted for at least 40 percent of GDP, and 
manufacturing for 14 percent at most. Fifty-five years 
later,  agriculture  accounted  for  only  3–13  percent 
of  GDP  and  manufacturing  for  more  than  25  per-
cent, underlining the huge shift from agriculture to 
manufacturing.

Other developing countries took a different path. 
In the largest Latin American economies – Argentina, 
Brazil and Mexico – the structure shifted from agri-
culture towards services (and to a lesser extent, non-
manufacturing industries). Taking the period’s end 
points, manufacturing’s share remained unchanged, 
but throughout the period it showed an inverted U 
shape (Tregenna 2013).

This difference is seen in two developing econo-
mies that in 1960 had the same GDP per capita: the 
Republic of Korea and Ghana (Figure 1.1). In 1960 
their structures were quite similar (the main differ-
ence was that manufacturing’s share in the Republic 
of Korea was 5 points higher than in Ghana, and agri-
culture’s share was 6 points lower).

Forty-five years later, these structures had changed 
radically.  The  Republic  of  Korea  had  transformed 
its structure, heavily reducing agriculture’s share by 
increasing that of manufacturing, but in Ghana agri-
culture remained the largest sector. Tellingly, and in 
line with a more normative understanding of struc-
tural change, the economic performance of the two 
countries was radically different, such that in 2005 
Ghana’s GDP per capita was only a tenth of that of 
the Republic of Korea. The country that changed the 
structure of its economy saw far stronger GDP per 
capita growth than the one that did not.

The  above  suggests  two  conclusions.  First,  any 
average across a heterogeneous sample of observations 
(such as resource-rich countries, small countries, large 
countries or regional groups) lends itself to identifying 
a pattern over time that is not particularly representa-
tive of any single country’s performance. Second, and 
more significant, the degree of heterogeneity inside 
the sample may become even greater as time passes, 
precisely as an outcome of structural change.

It is therefore instructive to look at how structural 
change takes place by looking at the changing impor-
tance of sectors at different incomes instead of differ-
ent moments in time. The approach now proposed in 
this subsection provides a way to visualize structural 
change  by  controlling  for  important  features  that 
shape differently the pattern of structural change of

countries  as  they  become  richer.  A  complementary 
view  to  the  more  traditional  analysis  of  structural 
change  over  time,  it  has  the  advantage  of  provid-
ing a unique picture to illustrate the general pattern 
of  structural  change,  without  averaging  the  impor-
tant differences in structure that arise from different 
incomes and two country-specific characteristics (nat-
ural resources and population).

This approach pools countries together not accord-
ing to any prior definition of development (such as 
advanced versus developing) but according to their 
income  at  any  point  in  time  (Box  1.2).  Structural 
change can then be seen as the set of transformations 
that takes place as countries become richer, regardless 
of the time it occurred and its speed. With our previ-
ous example, the Republic of Korea and Ghana would 
be pooled together in 1960 (when they had similar 
incomes  and  economic  structure)  but  not  in  2005 

(with a 10-fold difference in GDP per capita and dis-
similar structures).

At very low incomes (for some countries in the 
sample a contemporary feature, for others a feature of 
the early 1960s), agriculture accounts for a relatively 
high share of GDP, typically larger than manufactur-
ing and non-manufacturing industries together. This 
situation  is  reversed  as  income  grows:  manufactur-
ing starts gaining ground and reaches a peak of about 
20  percent  of  GDP  at  roughly  $14,000.2  In  other 
words economic development is associated with a near 
tripling of the share of manufacturing in the economy, 
largely  at  the  expense  of  agriculture,  whose  share 
shrinks dramatically (Figure 1.2).

After the peak the share of manufacturing starts 
declining and at very high incomes is comparable to 
earlier stages of development (describing an inverted 
U shape). As incomes rise, even in the initial stages 
of  development,  services’  share  keeps  growing  and 
agriculture’s  declines.  Non-manufacturing  indus-
tries show a sharp increase at very low incomes, but 
after peaking at around $4,000 they maintain a sta-
ble share. Overall, the graph does not display signifi-
cant changes at higher incomes or for high-income 
countries.

A key point is that structural change viewed at such 
an aggregate level with only sectors masks important 
features of what happens inside each sector (manufac-
turing is discussed in Chapter 3), including important 
breaks and heterogeneities within the timespan and 
sample  of  countries  considered.  Regression  results 
reveal significant time breaks over 1963–2007 and the 
significance of population size and natural resources 
on the patterns of structural change (Chapter 3). The 
masking of these features should not be read as invali-
dating the underlying econometric analysis, but their 
omission from the analysis would. The above figure 
depicts a pattern with all else being equal – if time, 
population  size  and  resource  endowments  are  kept 
constant. The following figures depict what happens 
when they are not.

To  begin  with,  according  to  our  econometric 
results, the following periods seem to have shown a

“ The patterns of structural change 

significantly shifted twice in the 1980s but 
seem to have remained statistically stable 
for the 20 years before and after that

Box 1.2 
A few methodological issues

the approach used can be challenged on methodological 
grounds. First, criticisms might be raised over comparing 
different countries at different points in time. second, the 
pattern of structural change might itself change over time, 
especially  over  half  a  century.  Finally,  pooling  together 
countries  that  are  extremely  heterogeneous  by  popula-
tion size and natural endowments might draw a mislead-
ing picture in which important characteristics that shape a 
country’s structure are averaged, ruling out the possibil-
ity of seeing the detail of structural change within each 
sector.

to  tackle  the  first  issue,  each  country’s  income  at 
each point in time is assessed using a measure that strips 
out  the  impact  of  inflation  (constant  prices  rather  than 
current prices) and in a manner that enables comparison 
across countries where costs of living are very different1 
and may reflect short-term distortions in exchange rates 
(countries are characterized by income according to their 
GdP per capita in 2005 purchasing power parity dollars). 
so despite its limits, this approach should minimize the 
potential biases of comparing the income of, say, a coun-
try in 1963 and another in 2007.

the  second  and  third  issues  are  more  problematic, 
and  can  only  be  addressed  through  econometric  tech-
niques that allow a statistical test for the significance of 
a  wide  range  of  variables.  In  the  following  analysis,  the 
sectoral shares of GdP at different incomes are calculated 

using  regression  analysis,  which  allows  for  exploring 
whether  these  countries  can  be  pooled  together,  and 
whether  there  are  some  time-  or  country-specific  char-
acteristics  that  should  be  considered  when  evaluating 
the general patterns of structural change. this approach 
allows for studying whether these patterns are stable over 
time and across countries with different characteristics.

the analysis is undertaken for a large panel dataset 
of  100  countries  over  1963–2007,  though  not  all  coun-
tries are represented for all years. Fixed effects are intro-
duced to account for the fact that each country enters the 
sample several times and that the observations for some 
countries (especially high-income ones) are more numer-
ous. For reasons of space, the details on the econometric 
approach and main regression results are not presented 
here.2 the focus instead is on the resulting charts, which 
show each economic sector’s estimated share at different 
per capita incomes, and thus the main structural transfor-
mations as countries become richer.

significantly  different  pattern  of  structural  change 
across  incomes:  1963–1980,  1981–1990  and  1991–
2007. In other words the patterns of structural change 
significantly shifted twice in the 1980s but seem to 
have  remained  statistically  stable  for  the  20  years 
before and after that. Readers familiar with global eco-
nomic trends will not be surprised by such a conclu-
sion, as many of the features of economic globalization 
picked up strongly in that decade.3

For the exposition’s sake, we show only the figures 
for the two end points, 1963–1980 and 1991–2007, 
and we focus on incomes up to $25,000, as that allows 
us to concentrate on the earlier, more interesting, part 
of the graph.

Most important for this chapter, the patterns in 
the two periods in Figure 1.3 are strikingly in line 
with that in Figure 1.2: structural change remained a 

process with broadly comparable features – with slight 
differences. In the earlier period (1963–1980) manu-
facturing reached its peak at a lower per capita income 
than in the second period (1991–2007), at $14,000 
instead of $16,000. Moreover, manufacturing’s share 
at this earlier period peak was much higher, at 24 per-
cent of GDP instead of 20 percent. But looking at the 
lowest incomes (less than $3,000 per capita), indus-
trialization seems to set in faster in the more recent 
period.

Taken together, these elements appear to suggest 
that, bar the lowest income countries, industrializa-
tion  has  become  more  elusive  in  the  new  interna-
tional context, a fact also documented in the litera-
ture (see, for example, Fagerberg and Verspagen 2002 
and Szirmai and Verspagen 2010). In addition, the 
role of manufacturing in a country’s economy seems

to  have  eroded  over  the  last  half  century,  which  is 
again compatible with the widely held idea of global 
deindustrialization.

Two other characteristics specific to the countries 
in the large sample are natural resource endowments 
and  population  size.  As  stressed  in  the  literature, 
these elements might have an important impact on 
the pattern of structural change. To study them, we 
have to split the regression sample to avoid analytical 
problems. Countries are identified as rich in natural 
resources based on a proxy variable calculated as the 
difference between exports and imports of crude natu-
ral resource commodities and expressed in per capita 
terms.4 Countries with at least $4,000 on this meas-
ure are defined as rich in natural resources.5 Countries 
with a population of more than 12 million are classi-
fied as large.

Our analysis supports the idea that these particu-
lar country characteristics are important. Both natu-
ral resource endowments and population size seem to 
have a significant impact on the transformations that 
take  place  in  the  productive  structure  as  countries 
become richer (Figure 1.4).

Once  more,  the  patterns  are  in  line  with  the 
aggregate picture. Both cases see a shift from agricul-
ture  towards  services  and  industry  at  low  incomes; 
later, industry starts declining and services become 
dominant. The importance of manufacturing and the 
income level at which the turning point takes place are 
quite different though.

With natural resource–rich countries, the impor-
tance of manufacturing at any level of income is lower 
than in the aggregate picture. The decline in its share 
starts at much lower income ($13,000). The impor-
tance of non-manufacturing industries is larger. And 
the  maximum  is  only  reached  at  very  high  income 
($25,000). These trends are in line with a large body 
of literature that highlights the potential bottlenecks 
arising from a rich natural resource base, where the 
economy’s incentives might be biased towards non-
manufacturing industries (or agriculture), to manu-
facturing’s detriment, leading to a “natural resource 
curse”  or  “Dutch  disease”  (see,  for  example,  Palma 
2005).

Large economies show exactly the opposite trend: 
manufacturing accounts for a much higher share of

GDP at all incomes and the turning point is reached 
only at $24,000, when manufacturing accounts for 
almost 25 percent of GDP. This pattern is sustained 
with  a  lower  share  of  services  at  all  incomes.  The 
greater importance of manufacturing in large econo-
mies is probably related to their larger domestic mar-
ket, which enables them to exploit economies of scale 
even at low levels of development.

Manufacturing and economic growth
Although  the  positive  perspective  simply  refers  to 
a change in the composition of an aggregate (in this 
case, the sectoral composition of GDP), the normative 
perspective expands this definition by including the 
notion of desirability in the direction of that change. 
Shifts in the economy from low-productivity activities 
with limited opportunities for technological change 

and  value-added  gains  towards  high-productivity 
activities with larger opportunities for innovation and 
value-added expansion would thus become the core 
of structural change and – more broadly – economic 
development.

Once structural change is understood from this 
latter perspective, manufacturing becomes one of the 
main engines of economic growth, and thus any shift 
of resources from low-productive activities (such as 
rural agriculture or urban informal services) towards 
manufacturing entails an important structural change 
bonus, in what some authors have labelled “growth-
enhancing structural change” (McMillan and Rodrik 
2011).

The literature presents several arguments to sup-
port the idea that manufacturing is the main engine of 
economic growth. Perhaps the most influential came 
from Nicholas Kaldor in the 1960s. In his view the 
capacity to generate dynamic, increasing returns and 
thus greater productivity through expanded produc-
tion was at the core of manufacturing.

Following this line it has been argued that manu-
facturing is the main driver of productivity growth. 
Compared  with  other  sectors,  manufacturing  pro-
vides  greater  opportunities  to  accumulate  capital, 
exploit economies of scale, acquire new technologies 
and  –  more  fundamentally  –  foster  embodied  and 
disembodied technological change. So, not only the 
level but also the dynamism of productivity is higher 
in manufacturing than in other sectors and thus the 
shift of resources into manufacturing entails static and 
dynamic structural change bonuses (Szirmai, Naudé 
and Alcorta 2013).

The  dynamism  of  manufacturing  also  has  key 
effects on the rest of the economy. Manufacturing has 
a pulling effect on other sectors arising from produc-
tive linkages. Its development stimulates, for example, 
the demand for more and better primary goods (in 
agriculture, forestry, fishing and mining) and services 
(such as banking, insurance, communications, trade 
and transport).

Manufacturing also generates externalities in tech-
nology development, skill creation and learning that

1“ For developing countries growth 

and development are not about pushing 
the technology frontier but rather about 
changing the structure of production towards 
activities with higher productivity

are crucial for competitiveness. For instance, manu-
facturing is the main vehicle for technology develop-
ment and innovation (Chapter 4), representing today’s 
hub for technical progress. Empirical evidence shows 
that manufacturing is the sector receiving by far the 
most investment in research and development (Lavopa 
and Szirmai 2012). It is well established that this type 
of  investment  has  positive  externalities  that  go  far 
beyond the productivity gains achieved in the same 
sector,  contributing  widely  to  productivity  growth 
in other sectors and thus fuelling overall economic 
growth.  Locational  externalities  (agglomeration 
effects – Chapter 2) arising through spillovers on the 
labour market, supplier networks and other areas of 
knowledge are also more likely to arise from manufac-
turing than from other sectors (Weiss 2013).

The  above  theoretical  arguments  are  backed  up 
by  a  large  body  of  empirical  studies  that  has  dem-
onstrated  a  close  positive  link  between  economic 
growth and structural change towards manufactur-
ing. Econometric evidence from 131 developing coun-
tries in 2000–2005 suggests that economic growth is 
correlated with manufacturing value-added growth 
(UNIDO 2009). A more sophisticated analysis of 89 
developed  and  developing  countries  in  1950–2005 
found that the share of manufacturing is positively 
related  to  economic  growth  and  that  this  effect  is 
more pronounced for poorer countries, confirming the 
“manufacturing as an engine of growth hypothesis” 
(Szirmai and Verspagen 2010; Figure 1.5). The find-
ings from these authors are in line with those reported 
by Rodrik (2007), which indicate that growth accel-
erations are closely associated with rapid increases in 
the share of manufactures in total exports or with an 
increase in the share of manufacturing employment in 
total employment.

A clear positive correlation is seen between the rate 
of per capita growth and of the increase in manufac-
turing’s share in total GDP. The country groups that 
achieved the fastest growth during the period are the 
countries where the shift towards manufacturing has 
been  most  intensive.  China,  the  first  Asian  newly 
industrialized  economies  and  South-East  Asia  are

examples. Though for a shorter period (1995–2007), 
transition  economies  also  seemed  to  adjust  to  this 
pattern: they showed steep increases in their share of 
manufacturing in GDP while growing very fast. At 
the other extreme are country groups (mainly in Latin 
America) that show exactly the opposite trend: they 
deindustrialized during the period and achieved very 
modest rates of GDP per capita growth.

The  above  analysis  confirms  a  pattern  familiar 
to  economic  thinking  and  explored  in  the  World 
Economic and Social Survey 2006 (UNDESA 2006a).

“ Manufacturing plays a fundamental 

role in sustained rapid growth

existing  technologies,  producing  manufacturing 
goods and services for world markets and rapidly accu-
mulating physical and human capital.

Slightly more recent empirical work also suggests 
that manufacturing plays a fundamental role in sus-
tained rapid growth. The Report of the Commission 
on Growth and Development identified 13 economies 
that managed to sustain very rapid growth of at least 
7 percent for 25 years or more after World War II: 
Botswana (1960–2005), Brazil (1950–1980), China 
(1961–2005), Hong Kong SAR China (1960–1997), 
Indonesia  (1966–1997),  Japan  (1950–1983),  the 
Republic  of  Korea  (1960–2001),  Malaysia  (1967–
1997),  Malta  (1963–1994),  Oman  (1960–1999), 
Singapore (1967–2002), Taiwan Province of China 
(1965–2002) and Thailand (1960–1997; World Bank 
2008).

The sample is remarkably diverse, including coun-
tries from all developing regions, some rich in natural 
resources, others not; some among the most populated 

countries in the world, others with a population below 
500,000 (World Bank 2008). Yet despite these differ-
ences, a striking fact – surprisingly not mentioned in 
the report – is that all but three were driven by manu-
facturing industries (Figure 1.6).6

In 8 of the 13 economies manufacturing shows the 
fastest growth, implying that this sector has increased 
its share in total GDP over the period – that is, the 
economy  has  shown  a  structural  change  towards 
manufacturing.  In  Brazil  and  Malta  manufactur-
ing and services grew at almost the same rate, and in 
only Botswana, China and Hong Kong SAR China 
did manufacturing show slower growth than services. 
These success stories reinforce the above argument for 
the key role of manufacturing industries in sustaining 
growth.

1“ Manufacturing is the engine of growth 

because of its larger opportunities for productivity 
gains compared with other sectors of the economy

as the engine of growth – its larger opportunities for 
productivity gains compared with other sectors of the 
economy. We analyse how the relative productivity of 
each major sector (here taken to be agriculture, manu-
facturing, non-manufacturing industry and services) 
evolves as countries develop.

Relative productivity is here simply defined as the 
ratio  between  the  output–labour  ratio  of  each  sec-
tor and that of the whole economy. This coefficient 
is  obtained  by  dividing  the  share  of  manufactur-
ing in GDP by the share of manufacturing in total 
employment.7

To get figures of this coefficient by income, we esti-
mate the average (weighted) shares of each sector in 
GDP and total employment for all countries and years 
that fall in that income range (Table 1.2). In the light 
of  the  previous  evidence  showing  structural  breaks 
over the last 50 years, we restrict the analysis to the 

last two decades.8 Moreover, since our econometric 
exercise showed that countries with natural resource 
wealth  follow  a  rather  peculiar  path  of  structural 
change, we excluded from the sample the countries 
richest in such resources.9 (See Effects of time, demo-
graphic and geographical conditions on manufacturing 
development in Chapter 3.)

Due to space limitations, we show only specific 
shares in the range of $1,000–$15,000, real purchas-
ing power parity (PPP) per capita. Three average shares 
are also presented for three groups of countries: low 
and lower middle income, upper middle income and 
high income.10

Based  on  the  above  share  values,  the  ratios  in 

Figure 1.7 have been derived.

The  relative  nature  of  the  indicators  used  in 
Figure 1.7 gives a straightforward rule to determine 
which  is  the  best  direction  of  structural  change  at

each level of development. The higher the series, the 
better the productivity gains: reallocation of resources 
(labour in this case) from one sector below to another 
above will lead to aggregate productivity gains.

As expected, non-manufacturing industries show 
the highest relative productivity at all levels of devel-
opment, mainly driven by the high capital intensity 
of  mining  and  public  utilities.  But  the  size  of  this 
sector is limited, as is its capacity to absorb labour. 
In most ranges of income the second-highest relative 
productivity is achieved by manufacturing industries, 
especially at GDP per capita of $2,000–$10,000 PPP, 
which underlines the importance of manufacturing 
in middle-income economies. And at very low income 
($2,000–$4,000  PPP),  the  relative  productivity  of 
manufacturing  rises  while  that  of  agriculture  and 
services falls, revealing that manufacturing delivers 
dynamic as well as static productivity gains.11

At  initial  stages  of  development,  services  show 
extremely  high  relative  productivity,  most  prob-
ably  driven  by  non-market  services  such  as  public 

administration, health or education. But immediately 
thereafter, this coefficient drops dramatically, mainly 
in line with the increase of low-productive services 
such as wholesale and retail trade and personal ser-
vices. Subsequently, the relative productivity of ser-
vices converges to the national average.

At high incomes ($17,000 and above) in fact, the 
relative productivity of the three major sectors (manu-
facturing, non-manufacturing industries and services) 
converge to the national average. At this stage, agricul-
ture’s share is already too small for this inter-sectoral 
structural change to drive productivity, and so struc-
tural  change  within  sectors  becomes  fundamental. 
The key at this stage is not shifting resources further 
towards  manufacturing  but  achieving  productivity 
growth within manufacturing (from low- to high-tech 
industries – Chapters 3 and 4). By the same token 
structural change within services also becomes a lead-
ing driver of productivity growth. (As we see next, 
development also entails an important structural shift 
from lower productivity non-tradable services towards 
higher productivity tradable services.)

Some  argue  that  the  “middle-income  trap”  is 
fundamentally a failure to achieve this sort of struc-
tural  change  within  sectors.  Recent  evidence  sug-
gests that countries that have shown rapid growth at 
low  incomes  but  are  unable  to  move  towards  more 
sophisticated industries or services tend to be stuck at 
middle-income levels and incapable of joining the rich 
nations (see, for example, Felipe, Abdon and Kumar 
2012 and Lee 2013).

This subsection ends with a sectoral comparison of 
relative labour productivity in which the service aggre-
gate is opened further to disentangle – at least partially  
– its heterogeneity. The service subsectors range from 
highly  productive,  tradable  information  and  com-
munications technology (ICT) professional services 
to low-productive, self-subsistence, non-tradable per-
sonal  services  such  as  street  vending.  In  particular, 
we distinguish three subgroups in the International 
Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC) Revision 3: 
tradable services, non-tradable services and non-mar-
ket services.12

“ Manufacturing manages to combine 

high relative productivity with a 
strong capacity to absorb labour

But the information needed to analyse the rela-
tive productivity at such a disaggregated level within 
services is unavailable in the data source used so far in 
this subsection. Therefore, the analysis is restricted to 
a sub-sample of 40 countries with data from the World 
Input-Output Database (Timmer 2012). This data-
base  provides  comparable  value  added  and  employ-
ment data by sector at the ISIC two-digit level for 14 
emerging countries and 26 advanced economies.13

Figures 1.8 and 1.9 also indicate the relative size of 
each sector in the whole economy, which is depicted 
by the width of each bar and defined by the number of 
workers of each country.

Figure 1.8 shows that in the 14 emerging econo-
mies  the  service  aggregate  disguises  heterogeneous 
subsectors. The most productive jobs of the economy 
are  in  extremely  modern  tradable  services  (mainly 
finance and professional activities) and – to a lesser 
extent – in some non-manufacturing industries (typi-
cally capital-intensive mining or public utilities). These 
sectors absorb a small (sometimes negligible) share of 
workers, however. After these sectors, manufacturing 

has the highest relative productivity while employing 
a substantial number of workers. That is, manufactur-
ing  manages  to  combine  high  relative  productivity 
with a strong capacity to absorb labour. At the other 
extreme are the largest labour-absorbing sectors, agri-
culture and non-tradable services, but they show much 
lower relative productivity.

In a scenario such as in Figure 1.8, labour shifts 
from agriculture and non-tradable services towards 
manufacturing  and  tradable  services  will  entail  a 
structural change bonus and gains in aggregate pro-
ductivity – the core of the structural change pattern 
described above. As countries develop, however, rela-
tive productivity across sectors tends to converge to 
the national average (see Figure 1.7). The more disag-
gregated pattern for the restricted sample of advanced 
economies confirms this pattern (Figure 1.9).

Differences in relative productivity are now almost 
negligible, though the ordering of sectors is very simi-
lar  to  that  of  the  14  emerging  countries’.  In  these 
advanced economies the share of tradable services in 
employment increases dramatically, even surpassing

productive than others, and so tend to be better 
paid and to offer better labour conditions

manufacturing  in  labour  absorption.  Agriculture 
accounts for an insignificant share of employment.

It may be easy to grasp intuitively the importance 
of manufacturing in economic growth and structural 
change,  but  the  sector’s  role  in  job  creation  is  less 
straightforward, as will be shown below.

effects that in turn contribute to higher demand and 
additional employment. On the supply side, by stimu-
lating  aggregate  growth,  especially  through  knowl-
edge spillovers, manufacturing has additional impacts 
on overall employment creation (Lavopa and Szirmai 
2012).

Manufacturing growth and 
employment
Structural change can be achieved in various ways, but 
using three themes most commonly explored in the 
growth-accounting literature, it is seen to be triggered 
by a shift in labour from the lower to the higher pro-
ductivity sector (labour-intensive structural change), 
by a shift in capital (through an increase in the capi-
tal–labour  ratio),  or  by  an  improvement  in  overall 
technology (understood broadly as total factor pro-
ductivity) – or a combination of all three. A cursory 
look at Table 1.2 shows, for example, that the direct 
absorption  of  workers  by  manufacturing  is  quite 
limited, as its share in total employment oscillates at 
10–20 percent of total employment.

Despite  this,  manufacturing  is  still  fundamen-
tal  to  the  labour  market.  Manufacturing  jobs  tend 
to  be  more  productive  than  others,  and  so  tend  to 
be better paid and to offer better labour conditions, 
such as security and employment benefits. This par-
ticular feature of manufacturing lies at the heart of 
the growth-enhancing structural change argument. 
Further, manufacturing’s strong productive linkages 
with other sectors lead to a much greater impact on 
employment creation due to indirect effects. A job in 
manufacturing is typically associated with more jobs 
in other sectors.

Beyond that are the “induced effects” – among the 
most important means for manufacturing to stimulate 
jobs – broadly defined as the external effects of invest-
ment in manufacturing other than productive link-
ages. These external effects take place on the demand 
and supply sides. On the demand side the net increases 
in incomes received by workers in jobs directly or indi-
rectly created through investment in manufacturing 
are  re-spent,  generating  Keynesian-type  multiplier 

Direct jobs created in manufacturing: 
formal and informal
This subsection aims to quantify the number of jobs 
created in manufacturing around the world over the 
last 40 years, but faces two methodological problems. 
First, sector-disaggregated employment data are lim-
ited, especially in developing countries and over a long 
period. Second, even when there are data, compara-
bility among countries may be affected by different 
definitions for employment status, type of occupation, 
coverage and so on. Still, two main sources of informa-
tion can be used: industry surveys and general house-
hold surveys.

Most countries carry out industry surveys. They 
typically provide reliable data on the number of man-
ufacturing employees working in formal enterprises 
and over a long period. But depending on country they 
may well cover only those firms employing at least 5 
or 10 workers, and exclude self-employed workers and 
unregistered employees, thus heavily underestimating 
the real number of jobs created in manufacturing.

The  number  of  manufacturing  jobs  can  also  be 
estimated from household surveys (or population cen-
suses). They generally cover all types of jobs but their 
data reliability on coverage and international compa-
rability, as well as the number of countries using them, 
are much more patchy. The estimates in this subsec-
tion combine both sources to provide a picture as close 
to reality as possible for manufacturing jobs (Box 1.3; 
Figure 1.10).

At the beginning of the period the global formal 
sector in red had around 140 million jobs, and showed 
a steady increase until the end of the 1980s. After an 
interruption of five years (between 1990 and 1995) 
when manufacturing jobs stagnated, the series contin-
ued growing up to a peak in 2007, before the global

Box 1.3 
Estimating manufacturing jobs

we first calculate, for each year, the number of manufac-
turing  jobs  according  to  the  unIdo  database  (unIdo 
2012a), which comprises data based on industry surveys 
for 166 countries back to the 1960s. the jobs obtained 
using this source could be generally described as formal 
manufacturing jobs, because they are typically in the for-
mal part of the economy. the estimates are then comple-
mented with data from household surveys and population 
censuses, as published in the International labour organ-
ization  databases  laBorsta  (Ilo  2011a)  and  Ilostat 
(Ilo 2013), to calculate a rough estimate of the number of 
jobs not captured by the first source.

For every country and year with data, the difference 
between the two sources is calculated to give the number 
of what may be termed informal manufacturing jobs. yet 
this method gives only a very rough approximation of the 
true number of informal jobs – by definition very hard to 

capture – and refers to a definition of informal that goes 
far  beyond  unregistered  jobs.  In  fact,  many  of  the  jobs 
captured by this procedure are registered workers in small 
enterprises, which are not captured in industrial surveys 
as these generally include firms above 10 employees.

Because International labour organization data are 
far weaker before 1995, we only estimate informal jobs for 
1995–2009. For earlier years we extrapolate back using 
the  formal–informal  ratio  for  1995.  But  even  within  the 
period with more reliable data (1995–2009), more than half 
the countries are still missing. In these cases gaps have 
been  filled  using  the  closest  available  data  (in  terms  of 
formal–informal ratio), either from the same country in a 
different year or, if missing, from a different country with 
similar characteristics (region or income).

Average annual growth in formal jobs was 1 percent

1“ A broader understanding of the 

interconnections between manufacturing and 
producer services is necessary to fully assess the 
impact of manufacturing in employment creation

was used before that year. The estimates suggest that 
focusing exclusively on formal jobs leaves out a large 
(and increasing) portion of all jobs created in manu-
facturing. In 1995 there were some 130 million infor-
mal jobs, at around 40 percent of the total; by 2009 
the figure had climbed to 187 million and the share to 
48 percent. Jobs in this case involve much more than 
what  a  traditional  definition  of  “informal”  would 
contain, because workers not subject to labour legis-
lation are included as are those working in small and 
medium enterprises and the self-employed. The rise of 
many emerging economies as new hubs in the world 
production of manufactures (Chapter 2) is an impor-
tant factor in this trend.

Taken together, formal and informal manufactur-
ing jobs accounted for almost 388 million jobs world-
wide in 2009, having grown at an average annual rate 
of 1.6 percent since 1970.

Manufacturing-related jobs in services
Failure  to  capture  informal  jobs  in  manufacturing 
is not the only way by which manufacturing jobs are 
typically  underestimated.  Perhaps  more  important, 
in view of the global economic transformations of the 
last few decades, is the unbundling of certain produc-
tion processes that statistically used to be included in 
manufacturing but are now included in services.

In fact, it could be argued that the very distinc-
tion between manufacturing and services has become 
blurred (Manyika et al. 2012). Not only are manufac-
turing firms increasingly outsourcing their non-core 
operations, such as warehousing, transport, human 
resource  management  and  information  technology, 
but manufactured products are increasingly bundled 
with  a  host  of  services  and  after-market  functions 
(such as telephone help-lines, extended warranty and 
repair  and  retail  services).  Indeed,  the  function  of 
services in the manufacturing process has been sorely 
neglected in historical and contemporary accounts of 
economic development.

These operations partly reflect the move by com-
panies towards a “core competence” model of organi-
zation (Prahalad and Hamel 1990). Manufacturing 

firms  have  tended  to  shed  many  of  their  service 
functions,  which  became  separate  entities  in  their 
own right and thus appear in the national accounts 
under “producer services” instead of being previously 
concealed under “manufacturing” itself. These “out-
sourced”  service  firms  co-produce  and  provide  ser-
vices for other manufacturing firms, thus improving 
the efficiency and diffusion of service knowledge to a 
wider variety of client firms.

A broader understanding of the interconnections 
between manufacturing and producer services is nec-
essary to fully assess the impact of manufacturing in 
employment  creation.  With  these  interactions  con-
sidered,  manufacturing  employment  becomes  more 
important than often appreciated.

Take the automotive industry. Logistics and ware-
housing, once the preserve of the car manufacturers 
themselves, have been outsourced to such an extent 
that the manufacturers now fully depend on a wide 
array  of  third-party  service  firms.  These  companies 
provide the support to distribute parts and warehouse 
components, transport parts and finished products to 
the international market, and cope with changes in 
production such as just-in-time manufacturing. And 
this is before the burgeoning business of advanced car 
sales operations, which provides after-market services 
ranging from repair to maintenance and to purchase 
finance, is taken into account.

The following section attempts to quantify the type 
of manufacturing-related jobs in services just described. 
Once again, the accuracy of estimates depends heavily 
on data availability. Precise estimates would demand 
industry- and country-specific case studies, which go 
far beyond the scope of this report. Instead, a more 
pragmatic approach is used, though undoubtedly less 
exact  and  based  on  input-output  tables  at  country 
level. In particular, the proportion of inputs going to 
manufacturing industries from different service activi-
ties are used to calculate the share of employment in 
these activities that could be regarded as manufactur-
ing-related jobs. For instance, if 20 percent of the busi-
ness service industry’s output goes to manufacturing, 
20 percent of that industry’s employment is computed

“ Any assessment of the scale of 

manufacturing’s employment creation 
based purely on data from industry surveys 
will heavily undercount the true size

as manufacturing related, thus excluding any indirect 
job creation due to multiplier effects.14

For  the  transport  and  wholesale  industries,  we 
included  both  the  proportion  of  their  services  due 
to manufacturing and their services due to receipt of 
manufacturing inputs in calculating their manufac-
turing-related  employment  (for  example,  transport 
in delivering natural resource commodities to manu-
facturing as well as delivering manufacturing goods 
to retailers) because these services depend highly on 
manufacturing activities.

The  proportion  of  inputs  used  to  calculate  the 
manufacturing-related jobs in services is taken from 
the World Input-Output Database, which provides 
detailed input-output data for 40 countries from six 
regions  between  1995  and  2009  (Timmer  2012).15 
Based  on  this  source  we  estimated  the  number  of 
manufacturing-related jobs created for each direct job 
in manufacturing, by country and region. We then 
applied the regional ratios to the total formal manu-
facturing jobs by region from the UNIDO database 
(UNIDO 2012a) and obtained figures for the total 
number of manufacturing-related jobs in services. We 

summed the regional figures to obtain the global total. 
Since the data from this source are only from 1995, for 
previous years (as previously) we extrapolated back, 
applying the ratio of formal jobs to manufacturing-
related jobs of 1995 to the total formal jobs between 
1970 and 1994 (Figure 1.11).

In  1995  manufacturing-related  jobs  in  services 
employed 73 million workers. Over 1995–2009 these 
jobs  grew  much  faster  than  those  in  direct  formal 
manufacturing (reflecting the outsourcing approaches 
discussed above) reaching 95 million by 2009.

Thus manufacturing – broadly defined to include 
formal, informal and manufacturing-related services– 
offered  almost  470  million  jobs  in  2009,  employ-
ing  around  16  percent  of  the  world’s  workforce  of 
2.9 billion (477 million in the peak year of 2007 over 
1995–2009).16

One  key  message  from  this  exercise  is  that  any 
assessment  of  the  scale  of  manufacturing’s  employ-
ment  creation  based  purely  on  data  from  indus-
try  surveys  will  heavily  undercount  the  true  size. 
Employment data from this type of source represent, 
at  best,  half  the  total  number  of  jobs  directly  and

1“ Manufacturing is also important for absorbing 

workers with modest skills and providing them with 
stable jobs and good benefits – as the sector where 
the world’s middle classes take shape and grow

indirectly created by manufacturing (and see Regional 
shifts in manufacturing-related services in Chapter 2 
and  Manufacturing-related  services  employment  in 
Chapter 3).

Scattered evidence gathered in Lavopa and Szirmai 
(2012) suggests that manufacturing is the sector with 
much stronger linkages and much larger employment 
multipliers in an economy: for every job created in 
manufacturing, their evidence points to two or three 
created outside manufacturing. This is much higher 
than our estimates on manufacturing-related jobs in 
services,  because  we  intentionally  calculated  them 
more conservatively: they include only certain sectors, 
do not include second- or third-round effects (input-
output multiplier effects) and do not include income-
induced effects.

We can thus conclude that the real impact of man-
ufacturing on employment creation is much higher 
than portrayed in Figure 1.11.

Quality of jobs
Manufacturing  jobs  possess  some  characteristics 
that make them more desirable than other types of 
employment,  including  higher  productivity  from  a 
macroeconomic  viewpoint  and  higher  wages,  bet-
ter working conditions, more opportunities for skill 
upgrading and many jobs for women from a social 
viewpoint.

Higher  productivity  jobs  are  normally  associ-
ated with higher wages. Historical evidence for the 
advanced economies and the successful newly indus-
trialized countries shows that wage gains associated 
with  industrializing  structural  change  have  greatly 
helped pull large sections of the population out of pov-
erty (Weiss 2013). Manufacturing is also important 
for absorbing workers with modest skills and provid-
ing them with stable jobs and good benefits – as the 
sector where “the world’s middle classes take shape 
and grow” (Rodrik 2011).

Some employment-intensive industries seem par-
ticularly well suited for this purpose, such as garment 
industries in many low-income countries (Fukunishi 
et  al.  2006;  Fukunishi  2012;  Chapter  4).  These 

industries  provide  wages  that  are  generally  higher, 
rural  opportunities  with  low  entry  barriers  for  less 
educated workers (especially females) and a relatively 
easy promotion to better positions.

Many individuals see manufacturing as a major 
source of good jobs. Besides offering higher wages, it 
typically provides better employee benefits and secu-
rity than jobs in other sectors and tends to develop 
higher skills than equivalent jobs in the rest of the 
economy (Lavopa and Szirmai 2012).17

Returning to the 14 emerging economies discussed 
above (see Figure 1.8), manufacturing is the largest 
sector for employment, paying above-average wages 
(Figure  1.12).  Although  mean  labour  incomes  are 
much higher in tradable services, the sector employs 
only a small portion of the workforce. Non-market 
services and non-manufacturing industries also pay 
very good wages, but their capacity to absorb labour 
is also limited. Non-tradable services and agriculture 
are  the  main  employers  of  the  economy,  but  their 
labour incomes are much lower than in other sectors. 
Manufacturing thus possesses the advantage of being

“ Manufacturing is an important 

source of good jobs for women

at  the  same  time  an  important  absorber  of  labour 
while paying above-average wages.

The picture is less clear for the 26 advanced econo-
mies. Although manufacturing still pays above- average 
wages (and is second on relative labour incomes), trad-
able services are a larger employer that pays even better 
wages (Figure 1.13).

These  figures  stress  again  the  potential  benefits 
(in this case, wages) that arise from the movement of 
labour from agriculture and non-tradable services into 
manufacturing,  especially  at  low  and  lower  middle 
incomes.

Female employment in manufacturing
Manufacturing industries can foster jobs for women: 
33  percent  of  manufacturing  workers  are  female,  a 
higher share than in agriculture (28 percent) and non-
manufacturing industries (9 percent), though lower 
than in services (47 percent; Figure 1.14). In view of 
manufacturing’s often better labour conditions, these 
data  suggest  that  manufacturing  is  an  important 
source of good jobs for women.

Figure 1.13 
Relative labour income and share in total 
employment by sector, 26 advanced 
economies, 2005

During the 1980s the female share in manufactur-
ing rose in all regions (apart from four non-European 
high-income economies). But from the mid-1990s it 
started to decline in higher income economies and in 
the Middle East and North Africa, though it contin-
ued growing in the lower middle- and middle-income 
economies  of  Latin  America  and  the  Caribbean  as 
well as in South Asia (Table 1.3). The share remained 
constant or declined from the mid-1990s in highly 
export-oriented manufacturing sectors in East Asia, 
including the more mature and higher income export-
ers (Hong Kong SAR China, the Republic of Korea, 
Singapore and Taiwan Province of China) as well as 
followers Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines (but 
not Thailand).18

This  East  Asian  “defeminization”,  commented 
on  by  many  observers,  is  explained  by  technologi-
cal  change  as  part  of  an  upgrading  progress  while 
exporters  move  into  technologically  more  sophis-
ticated and higher value goods. This shift typically 
requires  higher  capital–labour  ratios  and  a  higher 
ratio  of  skilled  to  unskilled  workers.  It  can  be 
explained either as a response to perceived demand

or  to  competition  from  lower  wage  economies.19 
The link between upgrading and declining female 
employment shares occurs either where female work-
ers have less access to skill training and education or 
where a form of gender discrimination exists, when 
firms prefer to train or employ male workers for spe-
cific tasks.

The impact of technology on female employment 
trends is ambiguous, however, as some evidence sug-
gests that recent trends in technology-creating econo-
mies  may  be  shifting  towards  greater  use  of  female 
rather than male workers on the grounds that cogni-
tive skills are more valuable than physical skills and 
that skill-intensive (typically ICT-based) technologies 
may gradually increase the relative demand for female 
labour. (See, for example, the analysis of the United 
States labour market in Welch 2000.) How long any 
such trends will take to emerge in technology-import-
ing economies is unclear. The evidence suggests that 
high export growth based on labour-intensive goods 
can have a potentially strong initial effect on female 
employment,  but  that  as  the  export  product  mix 
moves into more technologically sophisticated goods 
this employment effect weakens.

Unlike  East  Asia,  in  South  Asia  (India  and 
Pakistan)  as  well  as  in  Latin  America  and  the 
Caribbean, female employment shares continued to 

rise in most countries until 2007. For South Asia the 
dominant explanation seems to be that manufactur-
ing exports stayed at modest levels of technological 
sophistication, with continuing expansion of simple 
labour-intensive exports. For the Latin America and 
the Caribbean it was the relative lack of success of 
export manufacturing because, in the context of low-
productivity growth, firms attempted to reduce costs 
by  replacing  male  workers  with  lower  wage  female 
workers (Tejani and Milberg 2010). Some reasons for 
these variations are grounded in the changing geog-
raphy  of  manufacturing  employment,  examined  in 
detail in the next chapter.

3.  As the sample will have further data covering the 
period after the global financial crisis, a further 
break may appear but any analysis is premature 
at this stage.

8.  Further, only countries with adequate statistics on 
the share of each sector in total GDP and employ-
ment were selected, leading to a loss of coverage. 
For this reason the results from the table should 
not be compared with those in Figure 1.3, which 
are also based on a far more refined estimation 
technique and thus more robust and reliable.
Including these countries in the sample does not 
change  the  main  results.  The  main  difference 
is  that  the  series  on  non-manufacturing  indus-
tries’ relative productivity shows a rather strange 
peak at $21,000 per capita (mainly reflecting the 
high productivity in this sector of the major oil 
exporters).

nal thresholds, however, are defined in terms of 
gross national income per capita at current (Atlas 
method) dollars. Because our income levels are 
defined in terms of GDP per capita at constant 
2005 PPP values, a correspondence has been done 
to establish thresholds that deliver the most simi-
lar classification of countries as the World Bank’s 
definition. These thresholds are: low and lower 
middle  income,  $6,500  or  less;  upper  middle 
income, $6,500–$15,000; and high income, more 
than $15,000.

1Chapter 2
Structural transformation and 
the changing geography of 
manufacturing employment

As countries develop over time, the structure of their 
economy (and thus employment) changes, as seen in 
Chapter 1. This chapter looks at the spatial shifts in 
manufacturing  employment  between  regions  and 
countries,  as  well  as  within  countries,  stemming 
from the structural transformation or change. With 
developed countries becoming richer and many less 
developed countries being lifted out of poverty, recent 
decades have seen an important shift in the distribu-
tion of manufacturing around the globe. Although 
North America, Industrialized Europe and Japan still 
account for around 40 percent of global manufactur-
ing value added, the rise of value added in East Asia 
and the Pacific, particularly China, over the last few 
decades has been dramatic – a shift even more promi-
nent  than  in  manufacturing  employment  (World 
Bank 2013b; for a list of countries see Annex 8).

Although these trends generally confirm the pre-
diction that the share of manufacturing should first 
rise and then decline with income, other forces such as 
comparative advantage also affect how quickly or slowly 
structural change takes place in a given country. Trade 
and comparative advantage may explain, for example, 
why  some  high-income  countries  such  as  Germany 
maintain  an  important  manufacturing  sector.  The 
scope of trade in shaping the geographical distribution 
of manufacturing activity has become more prominent 
in recent decades with the entry of some important 
middle-income countries such as China and the Russian 
Federation into the World Trade Organization, and the 
increasing fragmentation of the value chain.

As relative productivity is an important driver of 
specialization and trade, agglomeration economies are 
important in explaining how manufacturing locates 
across  space.  The  emergence  of  some  countries  like 
China, the Republic of Korea and Singapore as manu-
facturing hubs is related to agglomeration economies at 
the country level. Yet this type of spatial clustering is 
usually more prominent within countries, because some 
forces that encourage geographical concentration are 

much stronger at the small geographical scale of regions, 
cities or towns than at the large geographical scale of 
countries. Within the United States, for instance, the 
Midwest used to be an important manufacturing region 
before turning into a “Rust Belt” and being replaced 
by other regional clusters, such as China’s eastern sea-
board. (Not all of China is becoming a factory; many of 
its regions remain based on agriculture.)

When looking within countries, manufacturing 
tends  to  become  geographically  more  concentrated 
during  the  structural  change  from  agriculture  to 
manufacturing, but the trend reverses when services 
become more important, for two main reasons. First, 
agriculture is land intensive, but this is less true of 
manufacturing and even less so of services. So when 
manufacturing  replaces  agriculture,  manufactur-
ing tends to cluster, but when services become more 
important manufacturing tends to disperse.

Second,  the  structural  change  is  driven  partly 
by  productivity  gains  and  innovation.  In  the  early 
stages of industrialization, when there are high gains 
from  knowledge  clusters,  manufacturing  concen-
trates. Later, as manufacturing matures, those gains 
become  smaller,  and  it  often  moves  to  areas  where 
land is cheaper. For example, in the last half century 
in advanced economies such as the United States and 
Western Europe, manufacturing has been relocating 
to less congested areas, making it geographically more 
dispersed. In less advanced economies this is less true, 
and manufacturing continues to have a strong pres-
ence in urban areas. There is thus a link between a 
country’s level of development and the geographical 
concentration of its manufacturing.

The overall trend of manufacturing to move to less 
congested  areas  in  advanced  economies  needs  to  be 
qualified in three ways. First, although manufacturing 
firms are moving out of cities, they are “suburbanizing” 
rather than “ruralizing”. They still have a strong motive 
to stay quite close to cities. Second, not all manufac-
turing subsectors are moving out of cities – the cost

“ Economic development leads to urbanization, 

and urbanization leads to economic development

of remoteness is greater in high-tech than in low-tech 
manufacturing.  Third,  the  increasing  fragmentation 
of the value chain implies that specialization is becom-
ing more functional than sectoral. This fragmentation 
allows  the  more  complex  parts  of  manufacturing  to 
remain in cities and the more routine-like parts to relo-
cate to cheaper places. Once again, cities remain attrac-
tive for the knowledge-intensive part of manufacturing.
Of course, it is not only economic development 
that leads to spatial concentration or urbanization – 
the opposite is true as well. Cities are laboratories for 
learning and knowledge creation. Wages are higher in 
urban environments because people are more produc-
tive. And the longer people stay in cities, the more pro-
ductive they become. The highly interactive environ-
ment stimulates knowledge acquisition – most young, 
innovative firms are in dense economic clusters and a 
disproportionate share of patents is generated in cities. 
All of this leads to a self-reinforcing process in which 
economic  development  leads  to  urbanization,  and 
urbanization leads to economic development.

But urbanization does not only have to do with 
productivity. People may also prefer living in cities 
because they enjoy the amenities there, and in some 

African countries, for example, we are witnessing ris-
ing urbanization without a structural transformation. 
This reflects cities being not just production centres 
but also consumption centres.

Shifts in manufacturing employment 
between regions and countries
One region has been the big winner in the employ-
ment  shifts  in  direct  manufacturing,  based  on  the 
“traditional” approach to counting jobs in the sector 
– East Asia and the Pacific.1 But the view for jobs in 
manufacturing-related services is more nuanced.

Shifts between regions in direct 
manufacturing
In Industrializing Europe, which includes transition 
economies, formal manufacturing jobs fell by more 
than half from about 33 million in 1970 to 7 million 
in  2010  (Figure  2.1).  Industrialized  Europe  shows 
a less dramatic rate of decrease in the period, from 
40 million to 31 million. In North America the drop 
was similar, from nearly 20 million to 14 million.

Countries in East Asia and the Pacific are the big 
winners  (Box  2.1):  they  gained  around  66  million

a structural transformation

Box 2.1 
Automotive and textile and apparel industries – a global shift to Asia

two major global employers – automotive (high-tech) and 
textiles and apparel (low-tech) – show similar geographical 
shifts to asia in manufacturing jobs, though at a different 
pace and for different reasons.

the automotive industry, which here covers the manu-
facture of motor vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers as well 
as of other transport equipment (34+35 IsIC revision 3), is 
still strongly represented in industrialized countries, hav-
ing shifted fewer jobs to developing regions (Box Figure 1), 
though the trend to low-cost countries is picking up. In 
absolute terms north america and Industrialized europe 
are  still  generating  a  good  many  automotive  jobs  but 
relatively are losing to countries such as China and India, 
which show rapidly rising employment.

the  textile  and  apparel  industry  is  the  more  labour 
intensive, tradable and easily accessible of the two due 
to its low entry costs and simple production technology, 
which has led to a more dramatic employment shift. (the 
industry refers here to the manufacture of textiles as well 
as the manufacture of apparel, and dressing and dyeing of 
fur – 17+18 IsIC revision 3.) Jobs had already moved from 
north america and Industrialized europe to Japan in the 
1950s; in later decades the shift continued to low-income 
countries,  notably  those  in  east  asia  and  the  Pacific, 

south and Central asia and latin america and the Car-
ibbean (Box Figure 2). the phasing out of the Multifibre 
arrangement (replaced in 1995 by the world trade organi-
zation agreement on textiles and Clothing) intensified the 
shift.

the reasons for the shift between the two industries 
differ – mainly the drive to conquer large emerging mar-
kets in the automotive industry (see Chapter 3) and cheap 
labour in textiles and apparel (staritz 2011).

For  both,  most  higher  value  activities  like  product 
development, design and branding have stayed put. this 
may  change  in  the  coming  years,  however,  in  response 
to a growing tendency for the more complex activities to 
move to emerging markets as they upgrade their skills and 
technology. automotive multinationals, for instance, have 
been allowed to set up design and engineering centres 
in China on the condition of technology sharing and can 
thus comply better with local customer requirements (in 
line with different preferences and purchasing conditions). 
In textiles and apparel the Indian industry is increasingly 
carrying out original design manufacturing – that is, it is 
covering all steps involved in production, including design, 
purchasing, cutting, sewing, trimming, packing and dis-
tributing (Frederick and Gereffi 2010).

2“ The positive impact of manufacturing 

on output and employment in services 
has increased in recent decades, 
especially in industrialized countries

formal manufacturing jobs (from 31 million in 1970 
to 97 million in 2010). Jobs in South and Central Asia 
shot up from around 6 million to 20 million and in 
Latin America and the Caribbean from 6 million to 
19 million.2

Shifts between countries in direct 
manufacturing
This subsection looks at the data at a more disaggre-
gated level. The top 10 countries by share of global for-
mal manufacturing jobs accounted for around 70 per-
cent of the total throughout the period, though this 
fairly constant share masks underlying geographical 
shifts (Table 2.1).

China, which replaced the Soviet Union at the top 
in 1990 and kept that spot in 2010, increased its share 
hugely, from 10 percent in 1970 to 34 percent in 2010, 
for an increase of about 55 million formal jobs. India 
moved up from eighth in 1970 to third in 2010, nearly 
doubling its share to 6 percent by adding about 7 mil-
lion formal jobs. Brazil, which started at number 13 
in 1970, moved into the top five by 2010, having more 
than doubled its share from 1.5 percent to 4.0 per-
cent, and increased jobs by about 5.6 million.3 Other 
countries moving into the top 10 include Bangladesh, 
Indonesia and Viet Nam.

In the other direction, France, Germany, Japan, 
Italy, Poland, the Russian Federation and the United 
Kingdom fell within or even out of their top 10 slots. 
The  Russian  Federation,  for  example,  lost  nearly 
23 million formal manufacturing jobs between 1991 
and 2010 (given the break-up of the Soviet Union any 
comparison  with  1970  would  be  meaningless),  and 
by 2010 had only around 8 million formal workers in 
manufacturing. Its global share dropped from 11 per-
cent to 4 percent in this period. The United Kingdom 
lost  around  5.7  million  formal  manufacturing  jobs 
between 1970 and 2010 (its share falling from 6 per-
cent to only 1 percent), and Japan gave up 3.6 million 
(losing half its share, from 8 percent to 4 percent). 
The losses in France, Germany and Poland were more 
modest.  The  United  States  continued  to  hold  sec-
ond position but still lost nearly 5.5 million formal 

manufacturing jobs as its share fell by more than half 
from 13 percent in 1970 to 6 percent in 2010.

Regional shifts in manufacturing-related 
services
The  positive  impact  of  manufacturing  on  output 
and employment in services has increased in recent 
decades, especially in industrialized countries. This 
greater  service  intensity  of  manufacturing  stems 
from  greater  demand  for  coordination  across  loca-
tions (because of outsourcing, for example) and from 
changes  in  technology  and  organization  (Falk  and 
Jarocinska 2010). If we thus take a broader view of 
manufacturing  and  include  manufacturing-related 
services, the decline of manufacturing in industrial-
ized countries is mitigated somewhat, as will be shown 
below.  Table  2.2  shows  that  manufacturing-related 
services have seven subcategories.

Based on the typology of services that identifies 
their relation to manufacturing, renting of machinery 
and equipment and other business activities (ISIC: 
71–74) – or business services for short – seems to be 
most closely linked to manufacturing production, fol-
lowed by trade, financial intermediation and trans-
port and inland transport (ISIC: 51, J, 52, 60) with a 
medium linkage to manufacturing. Real estate activi-
ties, post and telecommunications, other supporting 
and auxiliary transport activities as well as sale, main-
tenance and repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles 
(ISIC: 70, 63, 64, 50) show a low linkage to manufac-
turing, whereas hotels and restaurants as well as air 
and water transport (ISIC: H, 62, 61) show the lowest 
linkage.4

Manufacturing-related services still play an impor-
tant  role  in  industrialized  countries  (Figure  2.2): 
their jobs remained stable at around 32 million dur-
ing 1995–2009. Business services especially, such as 
design, research, engineering, branding, advertising 
and marketing, are still increasing and mitigate the 
decline of manufacturing employment in industrial-
ized countries. Looking at the share of employment in 
manufacturing-related services, industrialized econo-
mies have increased their share from 24 percent in

1995 to 29 percent in 2009 (of total manufacturing 
and manufacturing-related services employment).

Within the same period (1995–2009), the indus-
trializing countries show a strong increase from nearly 
34  million  to  around  51  million  manufacturing-
related services jobs (see Figure 2.2). East Asia and the 
Pacific, especially China, is the “power region” within 
the industrializing countries, as their manufacturing-
related services jobs increased from nearly 24 million 
jobs in 1995 to more than 31 million jobs in 2009 (see 
Figure 2.2). The region showed strong gains in all cat-
egories (except financial intermediation), notably in 
business services and transport. Increasing transport 
could also be linked to rising intra-regional trade and 
the increasing participation of regional countries in 
international production sharing.

Although  growth  of  direct  manufacturing 
employment  in  Latin  America  and  the  Caribbean 
is not as pronounced as in some other regions, par-
ticularly Asia, the growth in manufacturing-related 
services employment there has been quite dynamic, 
possibly because it uses such employment more for 
manufacturing  production  than  other  regions  (see 
Figure 2.2). Business services, wholesale, transport 
and financial intermediation made strong gains dur-
ing 1995–2009.

Overall, regional employment growth patterns in 
manufacturing-related services confirm that manufac-
turing and manufacturing-related activities are shift-
ing geographically to Asia, particularly to East Asia 
and the Pacific. At the same time, however, business 
services in Industrialized Europe and North America 
have stayed fairly stable, mitigating a little the drop 
in  direct  manufacturing  jobs  in  those  regions  (see 
Figure 2.2).

Shifts among regions and countries in 
manufacturing trade
The  evolution  of  net  manufactured  exports  among 
regions and over time confirms the broad employment 
patterns presented above. (The relationship between 
manufacturing trade and employment is considered 
in greater detail in Chapter 5.) Over 1970–2011 net 
manufactured  exports  of  East  Asia  and  the  Pacific 
soared from $2 billion to $653 billion (Figure 2.3). 
Another  region  that  saw  dramatic  gains  was 
Industrialized Europe (from $14 billion to $359 bil-
lion). But North America saw the balance of its net 
manufactured exports crash from a positive $4 bil-
lion to a $814 billion deficit. Industrializing Europe, 
Latin America and the Caribbean, the Middle East 
and North Africa, South and Central Asia and Sub-
Saharan Africa also recorded widening net deficits, 
though less dramatically.

These trends not only reflect structural transfor-
mation and changing comparative advantage but also 
changing trade balances, and so have to be interpreted 
with  caution.  Regions  that  were  running  increas-
ing trade surpluses, such as East Asia and the Pacific, 
may be increasing net exports in general and not just 
in manufacturing. Similarly, regions with widening 
trade deficits may see decreasing net exports across the 
board.

Changes in the country distribution of manufac-
tured exports have been largely led by China, which 
moved  from  12th  place  in  1990  to  the  top  spot  in 
2011, vastly increasing its net manufactured exports 
from  nearly  $1  billion  to  $604  billion  (Table  2.3). 
Again,  this  reflects  not  only  China’s  emergence  as

trade surplus with the rest of the world.

Strong increases in net manufactured exports are 
also  displayed  by  Thailand  and  some  high-income 
countries, such as Germany, Japan and the Republic 
of  Korea,  and  to  a  lesser  extent  by  Italy  and  the 
Netherlands.  These  are  all  countries  whose  pace  of 
structural  change  out  of  manufacturing  and  into 
services  has  been  slower  than  expected  given  their 
GDP,  probably  still  retaining  some  advantage  in 

manufacturing and thus allowing them to maintain 
a strong manufacturing export sector. Some of these 
countries, such as Germany and Japan, have thus suf-
fered  smaller  losses  in  manufacturing  employment 
than other countries with similar incomes.

the same period, but most in high-tech net exports. 
Industrialized  Europe  has  the  expected  picture  of 
a small trade deficit in low-tech net exports in 2011 
and a large surplus in resource-based (mainly due to 
Russia’s  high  surplus),  medium-  and  high-tech  net 
exports. South and Central Asia in 2011 shows a sur-
plus in low-tech net exports and a deficit in resource-
based, medium- and high-tech net exports.

Shifts in the global structure of production 
and trade through global value chains
The geographical shift in manufactured exports has 
been boosted by the worldwide fragmentation of pro-
duction,  increasingly  organized  along  global  value 
chains  (GVCs)  and  global  production  networks.5 
A value chain can be thought of as the “full range of 
activities that firms and workers do to bring a product 

from its conception to its end use and beyond” (Gereffi 
and Fernandez-Stark 2011, p. 4). Different tasks, such 
as product design and development, production, and 
marketing and distribution, are carried out in different 
countries that, rather than specialize in different final 
goods, specialize in different tasks or stages of the pro-
duction process (Grossman and Rossi-Hansberg 2008).
The rise of GVCs and the global pattern of pro-
duction is readily seen in trade in intermediate goods, 
a  widely  used  indicator  of  participation  in  GVCs. 
Such trade accounted for half of global trade in 2011, 
reflecting an increase over 1970–2011 from around 
$152 billion to $6,922 billion, or nearly 10 percent 
annually (Figure 2.5).

By region the shares of Industrialized Europe and 
North America declined by 25 percentage points dur-
ing 1970–2011 (Figure 2.6). The share of East Asia

and the Pacific increased – reflecting rising manufac-
turing capacity and related trade in intermediates – 
from 13 percent in 1970 to 35 percent in 2011.

The more pronounced role of Asia in global manu-
facturing  production  and  trade  is  largely  driven  by 

China (Figure 2.7). China, the largest exporter and 
importer of intermediate goods in Asia, shows very 
high  growth  rates,  far  above  the  regional  average, 
both for exports (with the Republic of Korea) and for 
imports (with Hong Kong SAR China and India).

Shifts in manufacturing employment 
within countries
The structural change leads to shifts in manufacturing 
activity not only between regions and countries but 
also within countries.

Structural change and geographical 
concentration
According to Marshall (1920), agglomeration econo-
mies have three possible sources. First, information 
and knowledge are more easily transmitted at short 
distances. These localized knowledge spillovers make 
it  more  attractive  for  firms  to  locate  close  to  each 
other.  Second,  the  geographical  concentration  of 
industry generates a localized market for specialized 
skills. This labour-market pooling gives further incen-
tives to firms to locate near each other. Third, the spa-
tial clustering of a particular industry creates a mar-
ket for specialized suppliers, which in turn increases 
the productivity of all the cluster’s firms. These three

centripetal forces generally work simultaneously when 
industries cluster.

During the structural change out of agriculture, 
manufacturing tends to become geographically more 
concentrated. In advanced economies services are now 
replacing manufacturing in urban areas as industrial 
production plants move out to less congested areas. So 
to analyse the relation between structural change and 
geographical concentration in countries, we need to 
look at manufacturing and services together, because 
both are associated with increases in urbanization.

Urbanization as proxy
With urbanization as a proxy for geographical con-
centration, the relation between the non-agricultural 
employment share and the degree of urbanization is 
positive and linear (Figure 2.8).6 On a linear regres-
sion the slope is equal to 0.8. This implies that a 1 per-
centage point increase in the share of manufacturing 
and service employment is associated with a 0.8 per-
centage point increase in urbanization. Thus, there is a 
strong positive correlation between structural change 
and urbanization.

If we focus exclusively on the share of manufactur-
ing, the relation with urbanization has an inverted U 
shape  (Figure  2.9).  Countries  with  intermediate 
levels of manufacturing employment have the high-
est urbanization: these correspond to the advanced 
economies in which the structural change into ser-
vices has led to a decrease in the share of manufactur-
ing employment. Countries with low or high shares 
of manufacturing employment are less urbanized, but 
the effect is not symmetric: the least urbanized have 
the lowest shares of manufacturing, and are usually 
the countries still heavily based on agriculture.

Rather than comparing the degree of geographi-
cal concentration in different countries at different 
stages of their structural change, we can also follow a 
country over time. The prediction is that as a country 
moves through its first and second transformations, 
the degree of geographical concentration increases.

Gross cell product
A  more  direct  measure  than  urbanization  for  geo-
graphical  concentration  comes  from  the  G-Econ 
research project at Yale University. For a large number

of countries the project has estimated “gross cell prod-
uct”, which is equivalent to GDP but measured at a 
1 degree longitude by 1 degree latitude resolution.7 
Using this information, we computed the share of a 

country’s total land area needed to produce 80 per-
cent of its GDP. The higher the share, the greater the 
geographical dispersion of economic activity. Figures 
for Pakistan, Argentina and the United States come 

48

2“ The structural change is thus associated with 

greater spatial concentration of economic activity

out at 0.57, 0.43 and 0.14, respectively (meaning that 
Pakistan, for example, produces 80 percent of its GDP 
on 57 percent of its land).

Given  the  evidence  on  structural  change  and 
urbanization presented earlier, we would expect the 
relation between structural change and geographical 
dispersion of GDP to be negative, which is indeed the 
case (Figure 2.10).8 Countries with a larger share of 
manufacturing and services in value added are geo-
graphically  less  dispersed.  The  structural  change  is 
thus associated with greater spatial concentration of 
economic activity.

Geographical concentration in different 
industries

Manufacturing and services
As  innovation  is  a  particularly  important  driver  of 
the  spatial  concentration  of  economic  activity,  the 
tendency towards clustering is stronger in sectors that 
benefit more from innovation. Recent evidence for the 
United States, for example, shows that services, which 
benefit more than manufacturing from information 

and communication technologies (ICTs; Hobijn and 
Jovanovic 2001), have become more concentrated in 
the past few decades, unlike more mature industries, 
which have become increasingly dispersed (Table 2.4 
and Box 2.2).

For example, in 1970 a county in the United States 
at the 70th percentile had 81 percent more manufac-
turing employment than a county at the 30th percen-
tile, but by 2000 this difference had fallen to 74 per-
cent, suggesting that manufacturing employment was 
becoming increasingly dispersed in the United States. 
But in services the difference between the counties at 
the 70th and 30th percentiles rose from 29 percent 
to 52 percent, indicating that services were becoming 
more concentrated. Thus although manufacturing is 
still more concentrated than the various service indus-
tries, the difference is narrowing (Desmet and Rossi-
Hansberg forthcoming).

Producer-related services
The increased spatial dispersion of manufacturing is 
less dramatic when we account for “producer-related 
services”,  such  as  wholesale,  retail,  and  finance,

partly because of demand from manufacturing. These 
services included, it is no longer true that all activity

The dynamo and the computer

the title of this box draws on the work of david (1990), 
which compared the many similarities between electricity 
and ICt. electrification in the early 20th century spawned 
important productivity gains and innovation in manufac-
turing,  whereas  ICt  in  the  late  part  of  the  century  pro-
portionately benefited services. as the incentive to geo-
graphically cluster is greater in highly innovative sectors, 
we would thus expect a tendency towards spatial concen-
tration in manufacturing in the early 20th century and in 
services in the late 20th century.

and this is exactly what we do see. For the united 
states  in  1900–1920  manufacturing’s  spatial  growth 
pattern is almost identical to that of services in recent 
decades – and very different from that of manufactur-
ing today (desmet and rossi-hansberg 2009). Focus-
ing on medium-size locations, the upward-sloping curve 
for  manufacturing  in  1900–1920  and  for  services  in 
1970–2000 suggests a tendency towards greater geo-
graphical  concentration:  larger  locations  grow  faster 
than  smaller  locations  (Box  Figure  1).  In  more  mature 
industries,  such  as  manufacturing  in  1970–2000,  the 
incentive to cluster is much weaker. thus we see spatial 
dispersion, as larger locations grow more slowly than 
smaller locations.

the us wholesale sector exhibits similar behaviour to 
that of manufacturing: it is becoming more dispersed. In 
contrast, retail and FIre are becoming spatially more con-
centrated. In FIre, a sector closely connected to ICt, the 

Manufacturing employment: patterns of 
dispersion
As economic activity becomes more clustered, land 
rents increase, giving rise to congestion costs. This 
caps the size of geographical clusters and cities. The 
incentive to locate in cities and other high-density 
locations thus depends on the strength of agglom-
eration economies and the importance of congestion 
costs.

In  advanced  economies,  as  seen,  agglomeration 
forces in manufacturing have become weaker, giving 
an incentive to manufacturing firms to move out of 
cities to cheaper areas – “suburbanizing”. But in less 

difference in employment between the county at the 70th 
percentile and that at the 30th increased from 38 percent 
in 1970 to 48 percent in 2000, indicating an increase in 
geographical concentration.

developed economies this is less true, as they are not as 
far along in the process of structural change.

Suburbanizing manufacturing jobs 
in advanced economies
In the United States and other advanced economies 
manufacturing has been relocating to less expensive 
places, giving rise to geographical dispersion. This is 
related  to  manufacturing  becoming  a  more  mature 
activity, so that learning spillovers and agglomeration 
economies have become less important.

But it does not mean that manufacturing is mov-
ing to the “middle of nowhere”. Data for United States 
counties  for  1972–2000  suggest  that  manufactur-
ing employment growth was slower in manufactur-
ing  clusters  but  higher  in  areas  40–50  kilometres 
away (Desmet and Fafchamps 2005). Manufacturing 
employment growth was also lower in areas with high 
employment in general (not just in manufacturing), 
and higher in areas 40–60 kilometres away. The find-
ing that manufacturing firms are moving out of clus-
ters but staying relatively close to them suggests that 
a cost of remoteness remains. One would expect this 
cost to be especially important for manufacturing sub-
sectors that benefit most from knowledge spillovers.

And  indeed,  Fallah  and  Partridge  (2012)  find 
that  remoteness  is  particularly  costly  in  high-tech 

activities. Their results show that being close to high-
density locations benefits employment growth in gen-
eral, but more so for high-tech sectors. Arauzo-Carod 
and Viladecans-Marsal (2009) find similar results for 
Spain. In a study of new entrants over 1992–1996, 
they  estimate  that  in  high-tech  manufacturing 
47.3 percent of new entrants located in the central city. 
In contrast, in intermediate- and low-tech manufac-
turing a lower 31.9 percent and 30.2 percent did. The 
fact that remoteness remains costly, and more so for 
high-tech sectors, is consistent with the link between 
the age of an industry and its geographical concentra-
tion. For highly innovative young industries there are 
powerful reasons to cluster, as knowledge spillovers 
are  an  important  driver  of  a  firm’s  performance  in 
those industries.

Geographical concentration of employment 
growth in developing countries
In advanced economies growth in innovative sectors is 
typically concentrated in medium–high-density loca-
tions. The evidence is more mixed for many developing 
countries. In some developing countries growth is con-
centrated in the largest, densest cities, while in others 
the picture is closer to that in the United States. Box 2.3 
focuses on the world’s largest two developing countries, 
India and China, and examines what is the case there.

Cities as centres of consumption – and 
learning
As  shown  above,  the  geographical  distribution  of 
employment is closely correlated with the geographi-
cal distribution of population. If firms have an incen-
tive to set up in cities, people follow. But sometimes 
jobs follow people. Many people prefer living in an 
urban environment because they enjoy the consump-
tion  amenities  these  environments  offer.  Evidence 
from the United States shows that population growth 
has  been  increasingly  concentrating  in  cities  with 
good weather, proximity to water and a wide range of 
cultural services (Glaeser, Kolko and Saiz 2001). Fast-
rising urbanization in many African countries, often 
in the absence of structural change, points in the same

Box 2.3 
Manufacturing employment growth in India and China

For  Indian  districts,  Box  Figure  1  plots  annual  employ-
ment growth in manufacturing between 2000 and 2005 as 
a function of initial manufacturing employment density in 
2000. although there is much heterogeneity among dis-
tricts, what stands out is that medium-density locations 
are  predicted  to  grow  less  than  high-density  locations. 
some  of  the  densest  districts,  such  as  Kolkata,  with  a 
manufacturing  employment  density  of  more  than  1,000 
employees per square kilometre, continue to grow surpris-
ingly fast. this picture differs from what we would expect, 
given the us experience when it went through its struc-
tural change out of agriculture.

India’s  experience  cannot,  however,  be  generalized 
to all developing countries. the corresponding chart for 
China  (Box  Figure  2)  shows  prefecture-level  cities  and 
likewise plots annual employment growth in manufactur-
ing  in  2000–2005  as  a  function  of  initial  manufacturing 

employment in 2000. In contrast to India, the highest den-
sity cities grow somewhat more slowly than the medium-
density  cities,  including  shanghai  and  shantou.  these 
findings  are  consistent  with  au  and  henderson  (2006) 
who find that some of the larger prefecture- level cities are 
increasingly turning towards services.

what is striking is that when we compare China and 
India, agglomeration economies are strongest in China at 
an employment density of around 3.5 in log terms (about 
30 employees per square kilometre), similar to the employ-
ment  density  for  which  agglomeration  economies  are 
weakest  in  India.  In  that  sense  manufacturing  in  China 
looks more like that in the united states in the early 20th 
century, but manufacturing in India looks very different. 
this suggests that certain barriers are preventing India’s 
medium-density locations from growing faster – one may 
be poor access to infrastructure.

direction:  cities  are  consumption  centres  as  well  as 
production centres. If people like to live in cities, firms 
will follow people, rather than the other way around.
People may also move to cities as an investment in 
their future, regarding them as centres of learning that 
help them acquire knowledge. It has long been known 

that people in large cities earn more than people in 
small  cities.  Those  are  the  standard  agglomeration 
economies: the high density of cities improves the pro-
ductivity of firms, implying higher wages.

What is less known is that someone who spends 
some time in a large city and then moves to a small

city also earns more than someone similar who did not 
spend time in a large city. This suggests that big cities 
allow workers to accumulate valuable experience and 
knowledge that they can take with them when they 
move away (Glaeser and Mare 2001). In principle this 
could simply be due to positive sorting: larger cities 
may attract workers who are already more productive 
in the first place.

De la Roca and Puga (2012), however, by following 
workers over their life time, control for such sorting 
and still find a positive effect of large cities on learn-
ing. In a study of Spain they show that someone who 
has spent 10 years working in Madrid (the country’s 
largest city) and then moves to Santiago (the coun-
try’s median city by size) continues to earn on aver-
age 13 percent more for the rest of their working life 
than someone who never left Santiago. A similar find-
ing holds for someone who spends 10 years in Seville 
(one of the country’s medium–large cities) rather than 
Madrid,  and  then  moves  to  Santiago,  although  as 
expected the effect is smaller.

Whatever  the  reason  –  whether  firms  are  look-
ing for knowledge spillovers in dense urban environ-
ments, whether people are attracted by urban ameni-
ties, or whether workers go to large cities in search of 
experience and learning – urbanization is continuing, 
with more and more mega-cities appearing around the 
world.

Many policy-makers wonder whether these mega-
cities  are  becoming  too  large,  yet  evidence  from 
Au  and  Henderson  (2006)  and  Desmet  and  Rossi-
Hansberg (2013) point to the contrary. In China, for 
example, there may be further welfare gains from hav-
ing more spatial concentration of economic activity in 
large cities. So, despite the many problems associated 
with cities, such as congestion and pollution, there are 
powerful reasons for people to continue flocking to 
them.

Notes
1.  For datasets used see Chapter 1.
2.  Looking  at  regional  informal  manufactur-
ing  employment  data  for  1995–2009,  we  can 

observe similar patterns for formal manufactur-
ing employment, except in Industrialized Europe. 
While this region was characterized by a slight 
increase of formal manufacturing jobs over 1990–
2010,  the  informal  jobs  decreased  slightly  over 
1995–2009.  Among  the  top  three  rankings  of 
informal manufacturing employment, East Asia 
and the Pacific holds first position in 2009 with 
59.8  million  informal  manufacturing  jobs,  fol-
lowed by South and Central Asia with 56.7 mil-
lion and Latin America and the Caribbean with 
40.3 million.

3.  Brazil almost doubled its formal manufacturing 
jobs over 1990–2010. This sharp rise could be a 
result  of  two  subsequent  reclassifications  from 
ISIC Rev. 2 to ISIC Rev. 3 (1990–1995) and from 
ISIC Rev. 4 to ISIC Rev. 3 (2008–2010). Between 
1996  and  2007  the  employment  figures  were 
reported in ISIC Rev. 3. Further, the number of 
establishments  reporting  relevant  figures  rose 
from 6,094,000 in 1990 to 29,368,000 in 2010 
establishments.

4.  The thresholds are established based on the aver-
age backward linkage coefficient calculated using 
input-output  techniques  on  the  World  Input-
Output  Database  (Timmer  2012).  The  thresh-
olds are the following: high-coefficients – higher 
than 0.1; medium – between 0.05 and 0.1; low 
– between 0.01 and 0.05; and very low – coeffi-
cients lower than 0.01.
In  line  with  Shepherd  and  Stone  (2013,  p.  4), 
“the concept of GVCs is closely related to those 
of  global  production  networks”.  The  main  dif-
ference  is  that  the  GVC  concept  is  inherently 
non-linear,  as  it  is  based  on  complex  network 
interactions.

5. 

6.  Urbanization measures the share of the popula-
tion living in urban areas. The positive correla-
tion between non-agricultural employment and 
urbanization may be partly driven by the defini-
tion  of  urbanization,  which  in  some  countries 
is related to the relative absence of primary sec-
tor  employment.  For  a  complete  definition  of

2Chapter 3
Structural change in manufacturing

Building  on  the  discussion  of  the  overall  economic 
structural change in the previous chapters, this chapter 
illustrates structural change within manufacturing in 
detail. It shows that at relatively low incomes manufac-
turing value added, productivity and employment tend 
to grow fast. Then, as countries achieve higher incomes, 
manufacturing employment slows because its major 
sources  (labour-intensive,  low-tech  industries)  start 
curtailing employment. This slowdown and eventual 
decline in employment usually occur while manufac-
turing value added and productivity keeps increasing.
At an advanced stage of industrialization, indus-
tries  with  a  higher  technological  level  grow  faster 
than others, and some of them could sustain their fast 
growth of value added even at very high GDP per cap-
ita. But such industries with high growth potential are 
usually more capital and technology intensive, and in 
terms of employment each one of those industries will 
create a fraction of the jobs of a labour-intensive indus-
try. Unlike value added, most manufacturing indus-
tries start reducing employment before the economy 
reaches $25,000 GDP per capita (at 2005 purchasing 
power parity dollars).

Still, as countries develop, manufacturing’s poten-
tial to create employment in manufacturing-related 
services increases. Thus even in industrialized coun-
tries, manufacturing makes a bigger contribution to 
employment than the direct manufacturing statistics 
might indicate. Most of those service jobs pay wages 
comparable to those in manufacturing.

Although this relationship between income and 
manufacturing structure has some elements of univer-
sality since countries more or less follow a similar path 
of structural change as income rises, comparable to 
structural change for the whole economy (Chapter 1), 
country-specific conditions are important: geographi-
cal and demographic conditions give countries natu-
ral advantages or disadvantages in developing certain 
industries (Katz 2000). There is also space for coun-
tries to shape the structure autonomously, which is 

why history, culture and policy also matter to a coun-
try’s development (Lin and Chang 2009).

Three labour-intensive industries – wearing apparel, 
textiles,  and  food  and  beverages  –  are  particularly 
important for industrialization to take off. They create 
a large number of formal, better paid jobs in manufac-
turing, absorbing the unemployed and underemployed 
rural workforce from less productive activities. Later, 
the manufacturing structure needs to be continually 
upgraded, and if that is successful, entry into more tech-
nology- and knowledge-intensive industries could both 
compensate for the decline in jobs in labour-intensive 
industries and enhance the quality of manufacturing 
jobs. Medium-tech industries perform a bridging role 
for industrialization: although their employment gen-
eration capacity is not as large as labour-intensive indus-
tries, they are crucial for generating investment goods 
and funds for further industrial upgrading. While each 
higher tech industry does not usually create as many 
jobs  as  a  labour-intensive  one,  the  successful  devel-
opment of the multiple higher tech industries could 
enhance the skills, technology and knowledge base of a 
country’s manufacturing sector, leading to higher man-
ufacturing productivity and wages.

Manufacturing development in low- and middle-
income countries could also improve women’s social 
and economic status as labour-intensive manufactur-
ing industries often employ more female than male 
workers. But their continuing concentration in these 
industries works against the sustained gains in wom-
en’s economic welfare when manufacturing becomes 
more technology intensive.

Manufacturing, structural change 
and economic development: selected 
country experiences

Shifts in manufacturing and economic growth
Four  country  examples  illustrate  the  relationship 
between  the  changes  in  manufacturing  structure 

55

“ The speed of exploiting the advantage in 

existing industries and laying the foundation 
for emerging industries through investment 
becomes key for fast economic growth

and  economic  development.  The  value  added  and 
employment data are available at the manufactur-
ing subsector level for 1963 and 1998 for four coun-
tries from different regions – Colombia, Hungary, 
Kenya and the Republic of Korea. In 1963 the GDP 
per capita of Kenya and the Republic of Korea were 
about  the  same  and  the  lowest  among  the  four. 
Hungary  and  Colombia  had  3.7  times  and  1.7 
times higher GDP per capita than the other two, 
respectively.

After 35 years the country that changed its struc-
ture the most also increased its GDP per capita the 
most: the Republic of Korea completely transformed 
its manufacturing structure from low- to high-tech 
industries and increased GDP per capita eight times, 
transforming  itself  from  one  of  the  poorest  to  the 
richest of the four (Figure 3.1). Over the same period 
Kenya  did  not  change  its  manufacturing  structure 
much – nor its GDP per capita.

Hungary  already  had  fairly  high  value-added 
shares  in  low/medium  and  high-tech  industries 
as  well  as  a  high  GDP  per  capita  in  1963  (see 
Figure 3.1). Over the 35 years it further increased 
the share of higher tech industries but not to the 
same degree as the Republic of Korea, and experi-
enced a slower increase in GDP per capita. Finally, 
Colombia increased the shares of some medium-tech 
industries and chemicals but not the shares of other 
high-tech industries, and it only doubled its GDP 
per capita.

While country-specific conditions might make a 
difference as to which industries within different tech-
nology groups develop more than others, such differ-
ences do not seem to override the relationship between 
the shift in the overall manufacturing structure and 
economic development.

The speed of development
If the transformation of the manufacturing structure 
has  a  strong  association  with  a  country’s  economic 
development, the speed of exploiting the advantage 
in existing industries and laying the foundation for 
emerging industries through investment becomes key 

for  fast  economic  growth.  To  illustrate,  Figure  3.2 
shows the estimated development patterns of indus-
tries in value added per capita (food and beverages, 
wearing apparel, basic metals, and electrical machin-
ery and apparatus) and the actual development paths 
of  the  Republic  of  Korea,  Malaysia  and  Sri  Lanka 
(Box 3.1).

The three countries have advantages in different 
industries that reflect their stage of development. Sri 
Lanka’s  is  in  relatively  labour-intensive  industries, 
such as food and beverages and wearing apparel, and 
thus  rapid  growth  in  these  industries  is  foreseen. 
Malaysia has already lost its advantage in these indus-
tries, but can still expect continuing growth for some 
time in basic metals as well as long-term growth in 
electrical machinery and apparatus. The Republic of 
Korea has already lost, or is about to lose, its advan-
tage in basic metals, but should keep its advantage in 
electrical machinery and apparatus for the foreseeable 
future.

Despite  similar  development  trajectories,  the 
speeds at which these three countries have exploited 
their advantages – and thus increased their income 
and, possibly, shifted their advantage from one indus-
try to another – differ (Table 3.1). All four industries 
developed much faster in the Republic of Korea than 
in Malaysia even during a similar stage of economic 
development:  in  wearing  apparel  around  20  times 
faster, and in basic metals and in electrical machinery 
and apparatus about 10 times faster. Sri Lanka’s indus-
tries  lagged  behind  Malaysia’s,  apart  from  wearing 
apparel.

Productivity  increases  are  crucial  in  accelerat-
ing  development.  The  higher  the  growth  of  labour 
productivity,  the  faster  a  country  moves  along  the 
development trajectories (Haraguchi 2012; Annex 1). 
Productivity  growth  is  especially  important  in 
explaining the speed of transformation of high-tech 
industries;  productivity  and  other  factors,  such  as 
wages, may be associated with the growth of low-tech 
industries (Chapter 4).

The  Republic  of  Korea  has  experienced  a  fast 
manufacturing transformation in pursuit of raising

Box 3.2 
Speed of manufacturing transformation

hoffmann (1958) identified the periods in which various 
countries  reached  different  stages  of  industrialization 
based  on  the  ratio  of  value  added  of  consumer-goods 
industries  (food,  drink  and  tobacco,  clothing  including 
footwear, leather goods and furniture) to capital-goods 
industries  (ferrous  and  non-ferrous  metals,  machin-
ery, vehicle building and chemicals). his study showed 
a  gradual  but  steady  decline  of  the  ratio  in  the united 
Kingdom  and  the  united  states  and  a  faster  decline 
of  the  ratio  in  Germany  and  Japan  as  industrialization 
progressed.

the  study  went  up  only  to  1960  and  so  did  not 
include the republic of Korea. to put that case in histori-
cal perspective and compare it with past industrialization 

patterns,  the  same  ratio  was  calculated  for  the  country 
(Box Figure 1) alongside hoffmann’s results.

the republic of Korea transformed its manufacturing 
structure much faster than early industrialized countries, 
as seen in its steeper downward slope. It took around 40 
years for the united Kingdom and 30 years for Germany 
and Japan to reduce the ratio from two to one, but the 
republic of Korea only 15. the country has had the fastest 
structural change of manufacturing among countries with 
time-series data in the last 50 years.

other countries vary (Box Figure 2). China seems to 
match the republic of Korea while others have industri-
alized slowly, seen little structural change and increased 
the  weight  of  consumer-goods  industries  rather  than 
industrial- goods industries.

subsection we use these general patterns to assess the 
effects of a country’s specific conditions.1

Development of manufacturing industries 
with different technology levels
Sustained economic growth entails structural change 
at a disaggregated level within manufacturing through 

technological upgrading and diversification, and then 
possibly  specialization  later  (Imbs  and  Wacziarg 
2003). Based on three technology groups in manu-
facturing industries, countries generally have a high 
share  of  low-tech  industries  at  low  incomes  (Table 
3.2). As countries increase their GDP per capita, that 
share rapidly declines while the shares of medium-tech

Note: Shaded rows represent the manufacturing industries analysed. The three groups follow the technology classification of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) 
based on research and development (R&D) intensity relative to value added and gross production statistics. The OECD classifies manufacturing industries into four categories of high-tech, medium-
high-tech, medium-low-tech and low-tech industries. In this report high-tech and medium-high-tech industries are combined and called high-tech industries, and medium-low-tech industry is 
called medium-tech industry. The classification reflects the average R&D intensity of industries, so there might be products of different R&D intensity in each technology category.
Source: UNIDO estimate based on UNIDO (2012a).

(mostly capital-intensive, resource-processing indus-
try) and high-tech (mostly capital- and technology-
intensive  industry)  groups  increase  (Figure  3.3). 
Although the medium-tech industries have a higher 
value-added  share  than  high-tech  industries  at  low 
income, the share of the former increases only slowly 
and hits the peak before reaching $20,000 GDP per 
capita. Then, only high-tech industries increase the 
value-added share at the expense of the shares of low- 
and medium-tech industries.

To investigate the details of manufacturing develop-
ment underlying the above structural change, the fol-
lowing analysis looks at the changes in the levels of the 
development of 10 out of 18 manufacturing industries at 

the two-digit level of International Standard Industrial 
Classification Revision 3 (Box 3.3). For this analysis, 
value  added  per  capita  and  employment–population 
ratio are used because, unlike shares, they are not influ-
enced by the ups and downs of other industries and so 
are better able to expose industrial characteristics (such 
as growth rates).2 The 10 industries are representative 
of manufacturing as a whole, comprising industries of 
different technological content and stages of develop-
ment. The 10 industries usually account for more than 
75 percent of value added and employment in manufac-
turing. They include three low-tech, three medium-tech 
and four high-tech industries with different degrees of 
labour intensity (Annex 2).

The following estimated patterns show how man-
ufacturing industries with different levels of technol-
ogy emerge as countries’ GDP per capita increases. 
The patterns for value added and for manufacturing 
employment  differ  (Figures  3.4  and  3.5).  For  value 
added,  many  manufacturing  industries  continue 

to grow at high incomes, and some accelerate their 
growth.  But  manufacturing  employment  does  not 
show continuous growth: it displays a rapid surge at 
low and lower middle incomes, but at high incomes no 
manufacturing industries are likely to sustain employ-
ment growth.

Box 3.3 
A note on data

Manufacturing
Most figures in this chapter have been produced based 
on the unIdo Industry statistics database at the Inter-
national standard Industrial Classification (IsIC) revision 
3 for the estimations of manufacturing development pat-
terns (unIdo 2012a). the dataset has unbalanced data on 
employment and value added for 23 manufacturing indus-
tries at the IsIC two-digit level for 1963–2007.

the 23 industries were consolidated into 18 industries 
because many countries reported some of the industries 
together – often grouping IsIC 18 and 19; 29 and 30; 31 
and  32;  and  34  and  35.  to  make  the  structural  change 
analysis  consistent  and  reliable,  these  pairs  were  com-
bined and indicated by the first industry of each pair (such 

as 18 for the combined 18 and 19) for the combined indus-
try throughout this chapter.

the maximum number of 74 countries for value added 
and  95  countries  for  employment  are  included  for  the 
estimations. the Index of Industrial Production is used to 
approximate real value added per capita, and fixed effects 
are applied to the regression analysis.

Income groups
the income levels that divide countries into low and lower 
middle, upper middle and high income are based on the 
definition in Chapter 1.

Within these general patterns, different industries 
have distinct patterns of development owing to differ-
ences in technological level and speed of technological 
change. The following discussion looks at three groups 
of industries classified by broad technology character-
istics: labour-intensive, low-tech industries; medium-
tech industries; and high-tech industries.

Among the labour-intensive, low-tech industries, 
the food and beverage industry is the only one that 
sustains  value-added  growth  as  countries  develop 
to upper middle and high incomes (see Figure 3.4), 
attributable to the industry’s relatively higher labour 
productivity  growth  and  longer  growth  of  employ-
ment, which are expressed in elasticity (Box 3.4).

Labour-intensive, low-tech industries
Among the 10 industries selected, food and bever-
ages, textiles, and wearing apparel belong to this cat-
egory.3 These three industries, relating to humans’ 
basic  necessities,  are  distinguished  by  their  higher 
levels of value added at relatively low incomes, as seen 
in Figure 3.6 (which magnifies the development pat-
terns at low and lower middle incomes in Figure 3.4). 
Due to their labour-intensive production processes, 
as they develop, these industries also employ much 
more  labour  than  other  industries,  contributing 
to the creation of formal manufacturing jobs with 
decent wages in often mainly agrarian economies (see 
Figure 3.5).

Box 3.4 
A note on income elasticities of value added 
per capita, employment–population ratio and 
labour productivity

the income elasticity describes the effect of a change 
in income on the three variables of industry, given a 
percentage change in income Y:

% change value added per capita i,  

employment–population ratio I, or labour productivity i

% change in Y

an  elasticity  of  greater  than  1  indicates  growth 
faster than GdP per capita growth while less than 0 
indicates decline.

“ Labour-intensive industries seem to 

be crucial in sustaining employment at 
low incomes and are the main reason for 
manufacturing’s overall role in employment 
generation at early stages of structural change

The food and beverage industry retains a decent 
level  of  labour  productivity  growth  and  shows  a 
slower decline in employment than textiles and wear-
ing apparel, helping maintain high value added and 
employment across all incomes (Figure 3.7).

Textiles  and  wearing  apparel  both  reduce  value 
added and employment as countries move into upper 
middle and high incomes, but the industries differ in 
their ability to substitute capital for labour. The textile 
industry can prolong the growth of value added after it 
starts reducing employment due to its greater ability to 
substitute capital for labour, as seen in a higher elastic-
ity of labour productivity than in wearing apparel (see 
Figure 3.7). In contrast, low-wage labour is the key fac-
tor input for production in wearing apparel, where the 
growth rates of employment and value added decline 
almost  in  parallel,  indicating  limited  room  for  the 
industry to substitute capital for labour. This charac-
teristic implies that once countries lose the labour-cost 

advantage, they tend to lose competitiveness in wear-
ing  apparel  quite  fast,  though  labour  costs  are  not 
always the sole determinant of cost competitiveness 
(see Box 4.1 in Chapter 4).

Labour-intensive industries thus seem to be cru-
cial  in  sustaining  employment  at  low  incomes  and 
are the main reason for manufacturing’s overall role 
in employment generation at early stages of structural 
change. As the population begins shifting from agri-
culture,  setting  up  labour-intensive  industries  may 
be the only option to absorb productively the many 
people seeking jobs. There are also opportunities for 
capital accumulation, and these are largely restricted 
to food and beverages and to textiles.

Labour-intensive,  low-tech  industries  provide 
significant opportunities for entry in low- and lower 
middle-income countries. African economies, as well 
as some Asian economies, can use these industries as a 
stepping stone towards industrialization. In addition

3“ Medium-tech industries share some 

common development patterns in emerging 
economies as prominent manufacturing 
industries during the upper middle-income 
development stage, but show slower growth 
than high-tech industries at high incomes

to being attractive thanks to their capacity to gener-
ate  employment  and  productivity,  these  industries 
exhibit low barriers to entry and initially cater to local 
tastes. Low-tech industries do not require huge capi-
tal outlays, and factories can be set up with workers 
who have fairly low skills. Local markets play a key 
role at the early stage of development, resulting in low 
information and learning costs. While some of these 
industries are highly competitive, particularly textiles 
and garments, new producers in lower income devel-
oping countries can benefit from continuous changes 
in international market conditions, particularly cost 
conditions, and thus at least can temporarily attract 
investment to their shores.

Medium-tech industries
Medium-tech industries share some common devel-
opment  patterns  in  emerging  economies  as  promi-
nent  manufacturing  industries  during  the  upper 

middle-income development stage, but show slower 
growth  than  high-tech  industries  at  high  incomes. 
Non-metallic  minerals,  basic  metals  and  fabricated 
metals fall into this category (see Table 3.2).

The non-metallic mineral industry is driven largely 
by domestic demand, producing bricks, cement and 
glass  mainly  for  construction.  The  industry,  like 
labour-intensive, low-tech industries, develops at quite 
low incomes. But the industry can sustain value-added 
growth longer than the textile and wearing apparel 
industries  due  to  its  slower  decline  in  employment 
growth while keeping similar or higher labour pro-
ductivity than these low-tech industries (Figure 3.8).

Basic metals and fabricated metals have a similar 
development pattern in value added per capita, but the 
relationships between the rates of growth of labour 
productivity  and  employment,  which  underlie  the 
changes in their per capita value added, differ mark-
edly between them (see Figure 3.4). Basic metals tend

3“ High-tech industries emerge at a fairly 

late stage of development and make a major 
contribution to manufacturing value added, usually 
after countries reach an upper middle-income level

to see a fairly rapid decline in employment growth, but 
the rapid increase in labour productivity helps sustain 
the growth of value added (see Figure 3.8). The fabri-
cated metal industry decreases both the rate of labour 
productivity  and  the  employment  growth  rate,  but 
the slower decline of the latter prolongs the growth of 
industry’s value added (see Figure 3.8).

Thus, while both industries produce metals, the 
basic metal industry as it develops employs a much 
more capital-intensive production process, which leads 
to higher labour productivity. The fabricated metal 
industry seems to be located further downstream in 
the production value chain linking material and prod-
uct producers, which involves more customization and 
less-automated production processes.

Medium-tech industries offer investment poten-
tial for middle- and upper middle-income developing 
countries. Although they do not generate significant 
employment,  they  are  high-productivity  industries 
and can generate resources for investment. Further, 
their products include steel, bricks, cement, boilers, 
metallic structures, hand tools and plastics, most of 
which are intermediate goods in high demand by more 
advanced  industries.  Global  markets  for  industrial 
inputs are growing fast, underpinned by the demand 
of emerging industrial powerhouses in East Asia, so 
these industries can also become important sources of 
foreign exchange.

High-tech industries
Chemical products, machinery and equipment, elec-
trical machinery and apparatus, and motor vehicles are 
classified as high-tech industries.4 Except for chemical 
products, they emerge at a fairly late stage of develop-
ment and make a major contribution to manufactur-
ing value added, usually after countries reach an upper 
middle-income level. Their contribution to manufac-
turing value added is much more significant than it is 
to manufacturing employment because any of these 
high-tech  industries  are  unlikely  to  reach  the  peak 
employment level of the three above labour-intensive 
industries – food and beverages, textiles and wearing 
apparel. Chemicals, machinery and equipment, and 

electrical machinery and apparatus are often the only 
ones that can sustain growth faster than GDP per cap-
ita growth at high incomes.

These three industries have fast growth of value 
added (elasticity greater than 1) over a wide range of 
incomes, mainly due to their rapid increase in labour 
productivity  growth  from  upper  middle  incomes 
(Figure 3.9). Electrical machinery and apparatus and 
to a lesser extent machinery and equipment seem to 
undergo  considerable  technological  change.  These 
industries have an extensive expansion stage at lower 
middle-incomes, where increasing their employment 
growth rates is the key contributing factor to their 
value added growth. Then, from the upper middle-
income stage, development is based more on rising 
labour productivity, which sustains the fast growth 
of value added during the slowdown of employment 
growth  (and  later  even  a  reduction  of  the  labour 
force).

The chemicals industry seems to share the charac-
teristics of domestic-oriented industries, such as food 
and beverages, non-metallic minerals, machinery and 
equipment, and electrical machinery and apparatus. 
Although it belongs to the high-tech group, it often 
emerges at an earlier stage of a country’s development 
due to demand for soap and basic chemical products 
such as colouring matters and tanning agents. Further, 
like the two domestic-oriented industries, it reduces 
its level of employment very slowly after reaching the 
peak.  But  at  high  incomes  chemicals  can  increase 
value added rapidly through fast growth of labour pro-
ductivity, similar to machinery and equipment and to 
electrical machinery and apparatus. These mixed char-
acteristics of the chemical industry seem to reflect the 
fact that it includes the production of a broad range of 
products with diverse technological content.

Finally, the motor vehicle industry is one of a few 
industries that show markedly different patterns of 
development between large and small countries (see 
Figure 3.9). For this reason the development charac-
teristics of the industry are introduced in the subsec-
tion Country size below, which discusses the impact of 
that variable on manufacturing development.

High-tech  industries  perform  a  less  important 
role in sustaining employment at higher incomes, as 
they only partly compensate for job losses in labour-
intensive industries. But they are critical for capital 
accumulation, skill development and improving the 
knowledge base of countries – and thus for improving 
productivity and, as will be seen, wages.

Changing elasticities of value added and 
employment
This subsection compares changes in the elasticities of 
value added and employment as real GDP per capita 
increases across industries (Figures 3.10 and 3.11). As 
in the development patterns of low-tech industries, 
economies generally experience fast growth of value 
added  before  reaching  a  high  income.  Among  the 
three low-tech industries here, only food and bever-
ages sustain growth over a long period, though it falls 
slowly.  In  contrast,  the  value  added  of  textiles  and 

wearing apparel declines relatively soon after the end 
of their fast-growth periods, and faster than in other 
industries.

Medium-tech industries maintain fast growth over 
a wider income range than low-tech industries. They 
also have a longer slow-growth range before decline 
(shown in orange in Figure 3.10), indicating that their 
growth rates decrease much more gradually than those 
of textiles and wearing apparel. Among the three tech-
nology groups, high-tech industries grow fast over the 
longest income range. Chemicals especially, as well as 
machinery and equipment, and electrical machinery 
and apparatus, sustain their growth up to very high 
incomes, and are unlikely to experience a decline of 
value added before reaching $40,000 GDP per capita.
Employment growth takes place over a narrower 
range of income in all manufacturing industries com-
pared  with  value-added  growth  (see  Figure  3.11).

employment, such as food and beverages, textiles, non-
metallic minerals and chemicals, see little fast growth 
in employment as they develop. At low incomes, wear-
ing  apparel  can  increase  employment  significantly, 
but once growth starts slowing, it does so sharply and 
starts declining within a short income range. Some 
high-tech industries, such as machinery and equip-
ment and electrical machinery and apparatus, can con-
tinue fast employment growth after reaching an upper 
middle income, but they also slow their employment 
growth significantly, usually before hitting $15,000 
GDP per capita, and nearly all manufacturing indus-
tries reduce their levels of employment at very high 
incomes of above $25,000 GDP per capita.

Figure 3.12 illustrates manufacturing structural 
change  by  showing  how  the  shares  of  employment 
and value added in the manufacturing total for each 
industry change as country incomes rise. Food and 
beverages and textiles are the two major industries for 

both employment and value added at low incomes. 
The trajectories of the two industries diverge, however, 
as countries industrialize. Although textiles reduce 
both the value added and employment shares continu-
ously (as seen in the movement of arrows towards the 
bottom left corner), food and beverages increase the 
share of employment at higher incomes after an initial 
decline, though the value-added share keeps declining. 
This U shape for food and beverages is mainly due to 
the rapid decline and then increase in the employment 
share.

For  long-term  manufacturing  development,  key 
industries for value added, besides food and beverages, 
are machinery and equipment, chemicals, and electri-
cal machinery and apparatus – and for employment, 
machinery and equipment, fabricated metals, and rub-
ber and plastic. Machinery and equipment similarly 
increases both value-added and employment shares as 
countries develop, reflected by its 45-degree line.

Employment in manufacturing-related 
services
The  development  impact  of  manufacturing  is  not 
confined to value added and employment within the 

sector. This subsection examines how different service 
industries  depend  on  the  demands  of  manufactur-
ing industries, and how these relationships change as 
countries develop.5

Labour-intensive, low-tech industries such as tex-
tiles and wearing apparel generate a large number of 
jobs in countries at low incomes, but such employment 
generates fewer related services jobs (Figure 3.13). In 
industrialized countries textiles and wearing apparel 
are  steadily  cutting  manufacturing  and  related  ser-
vices employment.

Although medium- and high-tech industries do 
not generate as many jobs as low-tech industries, their 
contributions  to  creating  related  services  jobs  are 
much  higher.  Figure  3.14  shows  that  medium-tech 
industries  such  as  non-metallic  minerals  and  basic 
and fabricated metals generate a higher proportion of 
manufacturing-related services jobs relative to manu-
facturing  jobs.  Increases  in  manufacturing-related 
services employment often compensate (or more than 
compensate) for the reduction in manufacturing jobs.
Countries  at  high  incomes  could  sustain  fast 
growth of some high-tech industries, such as chemicals 
and motor vehicles (for large countries; Figure 3.15). 
These industries also make significant contributions

to manufacturing-related services employment, espe-
cially business services.

Thus, if we take employment in manufacturing-
related  services  into  account,  manufacturing’s  con-
tribution  to  job  creation  is  more  sustained  than 
Figure 3.5 suggests. Although the decline in labour-
intensive, low-tech industries reduces manufacturing 

jobs as countries reach high incomes, medium- and 
high-tech industries, especially those sustaining value-
added growth at high incomes, create a relatively high 
proportion of jobs in manufacturing-related services. 
These contributions are important not only for mak-
ing up for declining manufacturing jobs but also for 
generating modern service jobs, which are likely to

“ Manufacturing structural change 

offers employment opportunities for high-
income countries as they transit from 
high-tech manufacturing production to 
manufacturing-related services

play a crucial role in linking high-tech manufactur-
ing industries with innovative service activities that 
support growth of increasingly service-oriented high-
income countries.

Beyond service employment directly dependent on 
manufacturing production, employment is generated 
throughout  the  production  chain  due  to  backward 
linkages and multiplier effects of production. If these 
full production effects are included, manufacturing-
related employment increases a further 10–30 percent.
In short, manufacturing structural change offers 
employment opportunities for high-income countries 
as they transit from high-tech manufacturing produc-
tion  to  manufacturing-related  services.  Developed 
countries aiming to increase value added while gener-
ating employment may thus find it optimal to focus 
on innovation and marketing, if they are not doing so 
already, to compensate partly or fully for the loss of 
such production jobs.

Effects of time, demographics 
and geography on manufacturing 
development

Changing characteristics in individual 
manufacturing industries over time
The broad pattern of industrialization by income (as in 
Figure 3.3) is unlikely to change drastically in future 

and if at all only slowly, taking historical studies as evi-
dence (see, for example, Chenery and Syrquin 1975, 
Clark 1957, Hoffmann 1958, and Kuznets 1966). But 
individual manufacturing industries do change their 
characteristics over the years.

For example, the value added pattern of the tex-
tile industry has shifted downward over the years, 
in contrast to the employment pattern of the rub-
ber and plastic industry for small countries (Figure 
3.16).6  This  means  that  rubber  and  plastics  can 
generate  more  employment  for  a  country  at  the 
same income as 10 years previously. This shift adds 
a  dynamic  element  to  the  analysis,  allowing  us  to 
assess  how  technology,  demand  and  other  factors 
that evolve over time change the course of manufac-
turing development.

To identify the emerging characteristics of the 18 
manufacturing industries in Table 3.2, the trends of 
both the levels of value added and employment have 
been studied for each industry since 1980. The results 
are categorized under five headings (Table 3.3).

The results show that a large number of industries 
are increasing their capital intensity.7 The seven indus-
tries intensifying capital use have added value with-
out increasing or even while decreasing employment. 
This is an industry-wide trend, so it characterizes the 
situation of those industries across countries at dif-
ferent  incomes.  The  results  seem  to  point  to  rising

Note: When value added and employment show a statistically significant increase in 
all three decades since 1980, the industry is classified as “Rising”. When an industry 
constantly sees declines in both variables, it is “Declining”. If an industry increases 
value added while decreasing (or at least not increasing) employment, it is “Intensifying 
capital use”. When there is evidence of an increase in employment and a decrease or no 
change in value added, it is “Intensifying labour use”. If there is no significant change in 
value added and employment, it is “Stable”. Industries exhibiting ambiguous trends are 
excluded; they are wearing apparel, wood products, printing and publishing, coke and 
refined petroleum, machinery and equipment, and precision instruments.

mechanization  and  standardization  of  production 
processes in many medium- and high-tech industries.
Only two industries, rubber and plastics and fur-
niture, are increasing employment (the former, value 
added  as  well).  Tobacco  and  textiles  are  declining 
industries as they have been reducing value added and 
employment, though this does not necessarily imply 
that their output volume or demand for their prod-
ucts has been decreasing in absolute terms, as produc-
tion volume may still rise alongside a declining price 
trend.

Finally,  food  and  beverages  have  been  remark-
ably stable (and in fact is one of the key industries 
for both value added and employment in countries 
across  different  incomes  and  different  geographical 
and demographic conditions). This stability no doubt 
stems from the nature of its products, which serve the 
basic needs of human beings in differentiated national 
markets.

Thus many medium- and high-tech industries have 
become capital intensive since the 1980s, increasing 
value added without adding much labour.

Changes in manufacturing structure over time
As individual manufacturing industries change their 
characteristics over the years, the industries’ relative 
importance and the structure of manufacturing also 
evolves.  This  subsection  discusses  how  the  devel-
opment  potential  of  manufacturing  industries  has 
changed since the 1960s.8

In  the  1960s  and  2000s  in  value-added  terms, 
high-tech industries developed more than medium-
tech industries, which reached higher levels of devel-
opment  than  low-tech  textiles  and  wearing  apparel 
(Figure 3.17). Divergence tends to occur in the upper 
middle-income stage when high-, medium- and low-
tech industries start experiencing faster, slower and 
negative growth, respectively. But in the 2000s the 
development potential of high-tech industries is much 
higher than in the 1960s, while there are not notice-
able differences in the development patterns of low-
tech and medium-tech industries. Among high-tech 
industries,  chemicals  and  electrical  machinery  and 
apparatus  have  greatly  increased  their  development 
potential relative to other industries, by increasing per 
capita value added and accelerating their growth rates.
Employment patterns have changed less than value 
added between the two periods (Figure 3.18). Among 
low-tech industries, employment in textiles has been 
markedly lower in recent years while food and bev-
erages  and  wearing  apparel  slightly  increased  and 
decreased, respectively, their potential for job creation. 
Another difference in employment patterns between 
the  1960s  and  the  2000s  is  the  slower  decline  of 
employment in high-tech industries at high incomes: 
they now have greater ability to keep employment over 
a wider range of incomes.

Effects of country size, population density 
and natural resource endowment
Income is usually the most influential determinant of 
manufacturing structure, as seen, but countries with 
different geographical and demographic conditions, 
history  and  policies  –  country-specific  attributes   – 
may pull away from its influence somewhat. For exam-
ple,  the  endowment  of  abundant  natural  resources

holding  other  conditions  constant  (Haraguchi  and 
Rezonja 2011; UNIDO 2012c).

have  much  control  in  the  short  to  medium  term

3“ Exports of resource commodities often lead 

to currency appreciation and make tradable 
manufacturing products less competitive

– and geographical conditions affect manufacturing 
structure. It shows that a country’s population size – 
based on the maximum likelihood test for identifying 
structural breaks, large countries are defined as hav-
ing more than 20 million people, and small countries 
fewer than that – tends to have overarching influence 
on economic structural change (Chenery and Taylor 
1968).

Densely  populated  countries,  owing  to  a  nega-
tive association with availability of mineral wealth, 
arable land and other natural endowments per head, 
are  likely  to  specialize  more  in  manufacturing  and 
in less resource-intensive manufacturing industries. 
Such countries may also draw advantages from lower 
transport and coordination costs (Keesing and Sherk 
1971). Exports of resource commodities often lead to 
currency appreciation and make tradable manufactur-
ing products less competitive.

Country size
Chapter 1 showed that a larger population is generally 
conducive to manufacturing development. Figure 3.19 

confirms  that  small  countries  generally  have  lower 
value added in manufacturing than large countries. 
There are also differences in structural change within 
manufacturing  between  large  and  small  countries. 
Large  countries,  at  higher  incomes,  tend  to  have  a 
divergent  pattern  of  thriving  and  other  industries, 
while in small countries, growth in most manufactur-
ing industries slows at higher incomes. By industry, 
small countries are likely to develop food and bever-
ages much earlier than large countries, but that indus-
try’s growth in those countries is not as sustainable as 
in large countries: growth in food and beverages starts 
slowing at around $10,000 GDP per capita and con-
tinues to slow, or even decline, at higher incomes.

Another difference is in motor vehicles. In large 
countries it is one of the key industries leading indus-
trialization  from  an  upper  middle-income  stage. 
(Other key industries are electrical machinery and 
apparatus,  chemicals,  machinery  and  equipment, 
and  food  and  beverages.)  In  small  countries  the 
industry’s  development  prospects  are  limited.  The 
difference may stem from a lack of the economies of

“ Higher population density is associated 

with positive impacts on value added in 
mainly medium- and high-tech industries

scale within the domestic market needed to put the 
industry  on  a  long-term  growth  path.  It  may  also 
be  because  multinational  automotive  companies 
often localize production in countries with a large 
domestic market and serve smaller countries through 
exports from them.

As with value added, emerging patterns of subsec-
tor manufacturing employment are similar between 
large and small countries (except for food and bever-
ages and for motor vehicles), but employment in small 
countries is generally lower across industries (Figure 
3.20). Food and beverages is the single most important 
manufacturing employer across different incomes for 
small countries, but in large countries three industries 
–  textiles,  wearing  apparel  and  food  and  beverages 
– together create a major portion of manufacturing 
employment up to upper middle-income level. Then, 
machinery and equipment, motor vehicles and elec-
trical machinery and apparatus generate substantial 
employment at high incomes up to around $30,000 
GDP per capita. At this stage in large countries the 
motor vehicle industry can become one of the top five 

sources of manufacturing employment (but is insig-
nificant for small countries).

Population density and natural resources
Higher  population  density  is  associated  with  posi-
tive impacts on value added in mainly medium- and 
high-tech industries, characterized as relatively capital 
and technology intensive, a finding largely expected 
(Figure 3.21). The strong impact on chemicals, motor 
vehicles and machinery and equipment may reflect the 
importance of distribution systems and production 
agglomerations.

The  effect  of  natural  resource  endowments  on 
manufacturing  valued  added  is  also  clear  (Box  3.5; 
see Figure 3.21), and largely confirms the economy-
wide results seen in Chapter 1 (see Figure 1.4). High 
endowments do not have a positive effect on a single 
industry, but they have particularly strong negative 
effects on electrical machinery and apparatus, motor 
vehicles  (for  large  countries)  and  chemicals,  which 
are  key  in  deepening  and  sustaining  industrializa-
tion from the upper middle-income stage. Thus for

Quality of manufacturing employment
Manufacturing’s  contribution  to  employment  can-
not be fully assessed unless one also considers qualita-
tive aspects, particularly, wages and aspects of female 
employment.

Manufacturing generally offers a competitive wage 
relative to the whole economy’s average (see Figures 1.12 
and 1.13 in Chapter 1). But wages between industries 
vary,  making  employment  in  some  more  favourable 
than others for poverty reduction, better living stand-
ards and a country’s economic development in general.

“ Labour-intensive, low-tech industries

average, especially wearing apparel and textiles

from different regions and at different incomes shows 
a positive correlation between wages and labour pro-
ductivity relative to the manufacturing sector’s aver-
age (Table 3.4; Nübler 2013a).9 Industries with high 
labour productivity pay high wages, those with lower 
labour productivity (mainly labour-intensive, low-tech 
industries) pay below the average manufacturing wage 
(Box 3.6).

The table also shows female employment relative 
to the manufacturing average. Labour-intensive, low-
tech industries employ larger shares of female workers 
than the average, especially wearing apparel and tex-
tiles, both of which have low productivity and wages. 
Precision instruments and electrical machinery and 
apparatus, in which manual dexterity is particularly 
valued, tend to have higher female employment than 
the average.

The following two subsections look further into 
wages and female employment by countries’ income 
group.

Box 3.6 
Why low wages are the norm for wearing apparel

the  wearing  apparel  industry  has  limited  room  for 
substituting capital for labour or the potential to raise 
labour productivity through capital investment because 
labour-intensive production processes with low-wage 
workers are the key contributing factor in the industry’s 
success. while in a short to medium term, productivity 
increase might help keep production cost low (see Box 
4.1 in Chapter 4), in the long term, once countries lose 
their wage advantage, the industry cannot usually sus-
tain growth and tends to move on to new, lower wage 
countries.  this  characteristic  explains  why  wearing 
apparel has the lowest wage and productivity among 
manufacturing industries.

Percent of wage level (relative to manufacturing average of 1)

As textiles and wearing apparel are two of the three 
largest  sources  of  manufacturing  employment  for 
these countries (food and beverages are the other – see 
Figure 3.5), many people are in low-wage manufac-
turing employment there, which coexists with fewer 

jobs paying far higher wages than the manufacturing 
average.

This  wage  structure  does  not  necessarily  work 
against a country’s development as long as the wages 
of  this  majority  of  manufacturing  employment  are 

77

3“ As countries develop, differences 

in wage levels among manufacturing 
industries tend to narrow due to the rise 
in labour productivity in low-wage jobs

higher than in the main sources of employment – that 
is,  agricultural,  subsistence  and  informal  activities. 
This is usually the case as is often seen in the large 
internal migration from rural to urban areas during 
early  industrialization.  Thus  the  emergence  of  low-
tech manufacturing industries and the creation of a 
large number of jobs that require only basic skills can 
help substantially reduce poverty in countries at this 
income.

At higher incomes the manufacturing structure 
shifts  from  labour  intensity  to  skill  intensity,  and 
the weight of medium- and high-tech industries in 
manufacturing  employment  grows  (see  Figure  3.5). 
While medium- and high-tech industries do not cre-
ate as many jobs as food and beverages, textiles and 
wearing apparel, their wages are usually higher than 
in those low-tech industries. In addition, as countries 
develop, differences in wage levels among manufac-
turing  industries  tend  to  narrow  due  to  the  rise  in 
labour productivity in low-wage jobs (see Figure 3.23). 
Manufacturing employment may thus lose headcount 
attractiveness as incomes rise, but the sector’s struc-
tural change helps raise its wages.

Female employment
Employment in manufacturing, as in other sectors, 
is not gender neutral, though data are scarce.10 Due 
to alleged and actual differences in physical abilities, 
divergent social norms and expectations for men and 
women, differences in access to training and education 
and outright discrimination, some manufacturing sec-
tors are feminized, others are not.

Female employment tends to concentrate in low-
tech,  export-oriented  and  labour-intensive  indus-
tries  (Figure  3.24).  In  low-income  countries  the 
female share of employment is nearly 50 percent in 
tobacco, textiles and electrical machinery and appa-
ratus. Relative to other country-income groups, these 
economies often have high female labour force par-
ticipation rates – though still lower than male rates 
– among the various manufacturing industries. This 
is  partly  because  at  an  early  stage  of  industrializa-
tion,  manufacturing  industries  (regardless  of  type) 

are much more labour intensive than at later stages 
(Haraguchi 2012).

In  low-  and  middle-income  countries  food  and 
beverages, textiles and wearing apparel are the major 
sources  of  formal  manufacturing  employment. 
Women’s participation in that workforce may not be 
far behind (or is even higher than) men’s participation 
in textiles and wearing apparel during manufactur-
ing’s incipient and take-off stages. Since women tend 
to allocate their incomes more to food and education 
than men, manufacturing development has important 
implications  not  only  for  improving  women’s  eco-
nomic and social status but also for alleviating pov-
erty (World Bank 2013a). But women have less access 
than  men  to  high-paying  jobs,  which  are  far  fewer 
than labour-intensive manufacturing jobs in low- and 
middle-income countries but which are found in some 
medium- and high-tech industries.

Manufacturing  in  industrialized  countries  may 
have been less conducive to improving women’s eco-
nomic status than the earlier stage of industrializa-
tion. Although higher paying jobs become more avail-
able  in  high-tech  industries  in  countries  with  high 
incomes, it seems that women are stuck in industries 
with  lower  compensation.  Even  in  the  high-tech 
industry of electrical machinery and apparatus, where 
women have quite high participation in the low- and 
middle-income stages of development, they lose out 
on employment to men (see Figure 3.24). This is prob-
ably related to the change in the nature of the industry 
from relatively labour-intensive, assembly-type activi-
ties to more technology- driven activities as countries 
develop.

Thus  regardless  of  a  country’s  stage  of  develop-
ment, women’s manufacturing employment is skewed 
towards labour-intensive jobs, which derive their com-
petitiveness from flexibility and cost rather than skills. 
This tendency might help lift women’s economic sta-
tus  when  a  country  has  few  formal  manufacturing 
jobs because in such circumstances labour-intensive 
manufacturing jobs allow people without skills to get 
a formal job, which is often superior to the alternative 
jobs on wages and security.

Share of female employment in total sector employment (percent)

But as industrialization advances, continuing con-
centration of female employment in labour-intensive 
work  is  a  concern  because  such  work  usually  pays 
less than jobs in other manufacturing industries that 
become more common as countries develop.

Notes
1. 

In this chapter the patterns of structural change 
in manufacturing value added and employment 
are  estimated  based  on  the  UNIDO  Industry 
Statistics Database Revision 3 (UNIDO 2012a). 

79

3The database includes unbalanced panel data of 
74  countries  for  value  added  and  95  countries 
for  employment  for  1963–2007.  Employment 
data included in the database are mostly formal 
employment, including employees of firms with at 
least 10 employees.

2.  Value added per capita of a manufacturing indus-
try indicates the development level of the industry 
in an internationally comparable manner, as GDP 
per capita does for a country’s economy. For the 
employment–population ratio, because employ-
ment  divided  by  population  tends  to  be  a  very 
small number, it is multiplied by 100.

3.  There  are  low-tech  industries  not  considered 
labour  intensive,  such  as  tobacco.  As  the  three 
low-tech industries included in this section are all 
labour intensive (Annex 2), they are labelled here 
labour-intensive, low-tech industries.

4.  The motor vehicle industry includes assembly as 

well as production of parts and accessories.

5.  The analysis in this section uses the World Input-
Output Database (Timmer 2012). Here manu-
facturing-related services employment is defined 
as  employment  in  the  services  sector,  required 
for  producing  and  delivering  manufacturing 
products.

6.  Value added is proxied by value added per capita 
and employment by the employment population 
ratio.

7.  Here, this characterization applies to an industry-
wide trend as opposed to structural change along 
income  level.  The  former,  industry-wide,  trend 
points to the fact that the same industry across all 
countries (for example, the basic metals industry, 
in countries with a GDP per capita of $2,000 and 
$25,000) has become capital intensive over the 
last 30 years. The latter case, structural change 
along  income  level,  differs  from  this  section’s 
analysis. For example, it refers to the situation in 

which the level of an industry’s capital intensity 
rises as income increases (this is usually the case 
for all industries, including furniture and wearing 
apparel).

8.  Figure  3.17,  which  shows  the  recent  pattern  of 
manufacturing development in the 2000s, is quite 
similar to Figure 3.4, which is based on the data 
since  1963  because  recent  data  are  more  avail-
able than the data from earlier years in UNIDO 
(2012a).

9.  Nübler (2013a) conducted a regression analysis on 
the correlation between relative wages and relative 
value added. The relationship was statistically sig-
nificant with R2 of 0.43.

Each of the three indicators was calculated 
for a particular sector in a particular country by 
normalizing and making the average value of the 
entire manufacturing sector 1. Then the value of 
each sector was calculated as the average of the 
countries, for which the indicator was calculated 
for each sector.

10.  Employment data by gender at the manufactur-
ing  subsector  level  are  very  limited,  so  the  few 
countries for which data are available are included 
in each income group. For Figure 3.24, 2005 is 
selected  to  maximize  the  number  of  countries 
while comparing different income groups for the 
same  year.  The  following  countries  are  in  each 
income  group.  Low-income  countries:  Eritrea, 
Ethiopia,  Kyrgyzstan  and  Tanzania.  Middle-
income countries: Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Ecuador, 
India, Indonesia, Islamic Republic of Iran, Jordan, 
Kazakhstan, Lithuania, Malaysia, Morocco, the 
Philippines and Turkey. High-income countries: 
Croatia, Cyprus, Japan, the Republic of Korea, 
Malta and Oman. Data for the same sets of coun-
tries for 1998 and 2000 show structures of female 
employment shares in manufacturing largely sim-
ilar to the 2005 figures.

 Drivers of manufacturing structural change 
and employment generation

This section first looks at what drives the structural 
change and industrial development analysed above. 
The drivers’ interactions are extremely diverse, com-
plex and non-linear but what stands out is that costs, 
as  well  as  technological  and  demand  conditions, 
remain crucial. In principle, structural change in any 
sector in any country is governed by the conditions 
of demand and supply for products and services that 
interact with each other. Supply-side conditions gen-
erally include wages, skills, technological change, firm 
size, location of production facilities and the overall 
business environment, which also determine indus-
try’s competitiveness and organization. Demand-side 
conditions include demand for imports and exports as 
well as foreign direct investment.

This section then looks at trade. Trade openness is 
an opportunity – and a threat – for low-income coun-
tries because it has not enhanced structural change 
in all regions. East Asia has become one of the most 

important  manufacturing  production  networks, 
aided by liberalization, while Latin America and Sub-
Saharan Africa have been largely left behind. Trade 
is underpinned by global value chains, and although 
these value chains may play less of a role in the future, 
technological upgrading is the best long-term strategy 
for a country to stay in them.

Finally, one emerging driver that deserves closer 
analysis is the efficient use of natural resources, both 
to keep costs down and preserve the environment. The 
paradigm of continually increasing demand of finite 
resources must be shifted as the past abundance of rel-
atively inexpensive natural resources, such as energy, 
water, and materials, is coming to an end. Approaches 
towards this “green structural change” will include 
adopting  industries  more  technologically  advanced 
and with higher labour and capital productivity. The 
key thus lies in decoupling natural resource use and 
environmental impacts from economic activity.

81

Chapter 4
Cost and supply-side 
structural change drivers

This chapter looks at five main supply-side drivers of 
structural  change  in  manufacturing:  wages,  skills, 
technological change, industrial organization and the 
overall business environment. Figure 4.1 shows the 
main supply and external demand drivers discussed in 
this and the following chapters. The list is by no means 
exhaustive,  and  not  all  the  possible  combinations 
of interactions have been included, due to a limited 
availability of evidence, but some of the key drivers of 
structural change and their interrelationships are dis-
cussed here.

Wages, sometimes considered the most important 
factor for the supply of manufactured goods, deter-
mine the cost of employment and through this the 
competitiveness of the industry. They also feed back 
into  aggregate  demand  for  manufactured  products 
on  the  domestic  market.  Neoclassical  theory  sug-
gests that, other things equal, rising wages cause indi-
vidual producers to limit or cut back on employment 
because they will tend to replace labour by investing 
in equipment and technology or ceasing production of 
goods that can no longer be manufactured profitably. 
The resulting argument is that lower wages stimulate 
production in manufacturing. But this view does not 
consider that low wages come with low labour produc-
tivity and high wages with higher productivity, which 
can stimulate increased production. Further, there is 
now enough evidence to suggest that high labour costs 
are often compensated for by advantages in infrastruc-
ture, logistics, cost and availability of supplies as well 
as the business environment. Wage costs remain, how-
ever, a main element of costs in most activities, and 
in a few labour-intensive sectors are the main drivers 
determining overall unit production costs.

Industrial  development  unfolds  according  to 
the labour force’s capacity to develop the appropri-
ate  skills  in  manufacturing.  Such  skills  determine 
the  competitiveness  of  an  industrial  sector  and  the 
structural  change  that  occurs  within  it.  Skills  for 
manufacturing change, and every stage of industrial 

development requires its particular skill set. The most 
sophisticated sectors require a high order of technical 
skills. But investing in a pool of highly educated uni-
versity graduates does not help in a developing country 
context – it is too early. Over long periods change in 
manufacturing has been biased towards using more 
skilled  labour,  which  has  widened  wage  inequality 
and weakened the relationship between output and 
employment  growth  in  manufacturing  in  low-  and 
lower middle-income countries.

Technological change is at the heart of structural 
change. Technology has important implications for 
the productivity of industrial processes and thus on 
the scale and scope of industrial production. Gains 
in technology raise productivity – and so fewer work-
ers (and often fewer other resources) are required to 
create the same output. A useful distinction can be 
made  between  process  innovation  based  on  capital 
investment,  which  saves  labour  (machines  replace 
workers), and product innovation based on research 
and  development  (R&D),  which  leads  to  new  and 
better products and often creates new jobs by extend-
ing production to penetrate new markets. So it is far 
from  inevitable  that  technological  change  reduces 
manufacturing employment in total. It will depend on 
the choices made – and the incentives provided – by 
society.

Industrial organization is another driver. It cov-
ers firm size and economies of scale in production, 
the way that production is organized across domestic 
and global value chains and the spatial distribution of 
production within national economies. For example, 
smaller firms on the international stage have gener-
ated fast employment growth but slower productivity 
growth, when controlling for other factors like firm 
age. Fragmentation of the production process along 
national and global value chains provides incentives 
for  producers  to  engage  in  location-specific  labour-
intensive segments of manufacturing. Agglomeration 
effects arising from clusters of productive enterprises

Employment

are important in improving competitiveness and rais-
ing employment, but clusters alone cannot guarantee 
these gains, which require supportive infrastructure 
and supplier networks and good managerial capacity.
Finally, there is the business environment, more an 
underlying condition than a driver. It includes access 
to  energy,  water  and  transport  facilities,  as  well  as 
institutional aspects related to government support, 
regulations, taxes and corruption, all of which influ-
ence  production  cost.  In  many  countries  access  to 
finance is particularly critical, and can become a key 
constraint to structural change.

But the impact of supply-side drivers on structural 
change has not been unambiguous. Wages can support 
employment generation or hinder it depending not 
only on their level and how they are set but also on the 
availability of infrastructure. The timing of the provi-
sion of the required skills seems to be crucially impor-
tant for them to perform a positive role in supporting 
new job creation. Technology sheds labour if it is pro-
cess oriented but generates employment if it is product 

oriented. It is the state (alongside the private sector) 
that needs to work hard to ensure that the drivers sup-
port employment generation while transforming the 
economy (a point taken up further in Chapter 7).

Wages: important, but not the 
only driver
Wage costs contribute to structural change in manu-
facturing as they determine overall production costs 
and competitiveness. But the advantage of low wage 
costs can be offset by low labour productivity or cost 
disadvantages  for  infrastructure,  input  supplies  or 
regulations and taxes affecting the business environ-
ment, as well as by macroeconomic problems leading 
to inflation and an overvalued exchange rate.

A  wage  advantage  is  more  important  in  some 
areas of manufacturing than others depending on the 
labour intensity of production (Annex 2 lists labour-
intensive  manufacturing  industries).1  Three  labour-
intensive industries – wearing apparel, textiles, and 
food and beverages – are particularly important for

industrialization to take off (see Patterns of structural 
change and employment generation within manufac-
turing in Chapter 3). Globally, these three industries 
account for 30 percent of manufacturing value added, 
but the share varies by income: low-income countries 
have  a  15–20  percent  higher  share  than  the  global 
average, and high-income countries a 10–15 percent 
lower share (Figure 4.2). All country income groups 
have, however, been reducing their share of labour-
intensive  industries  in  manufacturing  value  added 
over the last 20 years.

Costs per worker vary hugely around the world but 
low wages are no guarantee of cost competitiveness even 
in labour-intensive tradable sectors. There is consider-
able evidence that economies with low absolute wages 
in dollar terms, such as most of Sub-Saharan Africa, 
are still uncompetitive in many light-manufacturing 
industries. Producers can stay competitive only if pro-
ductivity gains match wage increases, as illustrated by 
survey data of formal firms in China, Ethiopia, the 
United Republic of Tanzania, Viet Nam and Zambia

from 2009/10 (Dinh et al. 2012).2 For most products 
and  processes  analysed  (polo  shirts,  wooden  chairs, 
leather loafers and wheat processing), the advantage of 
low wages was offset by lower labour productivity, as 
well as by higher input and logistics costs, such that for 
factory-gate costs African firms in all countries could 
compete with China only on leather goods.

This point is further backed up by Clarke (2012) 
whose  analysis  of  World  Bank  Enterprise  Surveys 
since  2006  shows  African  firms  paying  wages  well 
below those of East Asian exporting economies. But 
once one controls for per capita income across coun-
tries, wages in Africa are higher than expected rela-
tive to those in surveyed firms in economies at similar 
incomes. Because of the productivity differences, unit 
labour costs in East Asia (China, Indonesia, Malaysia 
and the Philippines) are an estimated 20 percent lower 
than in Africa (Clarke 2012).

These  examples  confirm  that  low-wage  econo-
mies cannot necessarily compete with China or other 
low-cost suppliers simply with wages, even in simple 
labour-intensive activities. Instead, industries can be 
set up and jobs created when unit labour costs are low 
– and costs of other production factors are favourable. 
There is scope for policy intervention and infrastruc-
ture investment by public and private sectors. Wages 
are only one piece in the puzzle for where it makes 
sense to locate (Box 4.1).

Skills: an often underrated driver
Skill formation shapes the capacity to produce indus-
trial goods competitively. Crucial for industrial develop-
ment, it is expected to positively affect economic growth 
as a whole (DFID 2011; Box 4.2; also see Chapter 8).
Many  studies  support  the  argument  that  edu-
cation  has  a  positive  impact  on  economic  growth. 
Bassanini and Scarpetta (2001) and Sianesi and van 
Reenen (2003) report, for example, that a one-year 
increase in average education raises per capita income 
3–6 percent. Topel (1999), analysing labour produc-
tivity,  finds  that  a  one-year  increase  in  the  average 
years of schooling of the labour force raises output 
per worker 5–15 percent. Skill development not only

Wages and productivity in low-income garment-producing countries

a study based on firm-level data from Bangladesh, Cam-
bodia,  Kenya  and  Madagascar  for  2002  and  2008  finds 
that despite having similarly low wages, the four countries 
have  very  different  pathways  for  increasing  productiv-
ity and developing their garment industry (Fukunishi and 
yamagata  2013).  all  low-income  countries,  they  experi-
enced rapid growth in garment exports to developed coun-
tries. the Bangladeshi industry started to grow in the early 
1980s, followed by that of Madagascar in the beginning of 
1990s, based on investment from Mauritius. the Cambo-
dian industry started exports in the late 1990s underpinned 
by a bilateral trade agreement with the united states. the 
Kenyan industry saw rapid growth in the early 2000s, trig-
gered by duty-free access to the us market.

wages in each country in 2008 were well below those 
in China and in middle-income exporters like Mexico and 
turkey, suggesting that wages were driving competitive-
ness.  But  Bangladesh,  Cambodia  and  Kenya  saw  sub-
stantial  wage  increases  over  2002–2008,  with  nominal 
wage growth ranging from 36.5 percent to 65.8 percent. 
unit costs were broadly similar in Bangladesh, Cambo-
dia and Madagascar, as higher productivity in Cambodia 
and Madagascar offset their higher wages than those in 
Bangladesh.

Cambodian firms fared particularly well against those 
in Bangladesh, achieving steep productivity gains, while 
firms in Bangladesh had stagnant productivity. Cambodia 

achieved its productivity growth through several channels: 
a high rate of firm turnover facilitated the closure of unpro-
ductive firms and the entry of productive companies, and 
among those that continued operating, process innovation 
and greater educational attainment of workers came into 
play. Fukunishi and yamagata found no evidence of prod-
uct upgrading.

Cambodian garment firms thus successfully mitigated 
the  adverse  effect  of  increased  wages  on  competitive-
ness  by  lifting  productivity,  while  the  Bangladeshi  firms 
absorbed rising costs by reducing the large profit margin 
that they had enjoyed under the Multifibre arrangement 
(MFa), which allowed it preferential exports to developed 
countries. In Kenya, where wages were higher than in the 
other countries, many garment firms closed after the MFa 
ended in 2005, suggesting that the country found it hard 
to maintain competitiveness with its rising wages.

the overall conclusions are two-fold. First, employ-
ment  in  the  garment  industry  provides  a  good  income 
opportunity for the less educated. even after trade liberali-
zation and the end of the MFa, real wages have increased 
and working conditions improved. second, productivity 
growth is the key to expanding production and employ-
ment  and  upgrading  job  quality,  even  when  wages  are 
rising.

affects individual’s employability, but it also allows 
him or her to increase wages and helps ensure better 
job quality and labour conditions (Vandenberghe and 
Debande 2004). Increased skills are related to higher 
rates of labour force participation, especially among 
women (Table 4.1).

Social and private returns to education
A number of studies have calculated returns on invest-
ment  in  education.  Psacharopoulos  and  Patrinos 
(2004a) found that social returns (which take into 
account  externalities,  as  other  people  benefit  from 
knowledge spillovers of an individual’s higher educa-
tion) and private returns on investment in education 
were positive, especially for less developed countries 
(Table  4.2).3  Their  results  emphasize  that  primary 
education  is  more  important  in  regions  with  lower 

development,  particularly  in  Sub-Saharan  Africa, 
where the portion of educated people is much lower 
than in other regions. For countries at higher levels of 
development the importance of higher levels of educa-
tional attainment increases.

Manufacturing is a major employer of engineer-
ing graduates. The returns on investment for those 
who have studied engineering at a university seem to 
be higher than the average for tertiary education. They 
seem to be higher in developing than industrialized 
countries, and the gap is bigger for social than private 
returns (Table 4.3).

A  skilled  labour  force  in  manufacturing  is  also 
expected to boost international competitiveness. For 
example,  investing  in  education  has  a  considerable 
positive  effect  on  the  growth  of  exports  (UNIDO 
2011a),  and  a  more  skilled  workforce  is  generally

Education and economic growth in the Republic of Korea and Pakistan

the republic of Korea and Pakistan started with roughly 
the same per capita income in 1950. But over 1950–2010 
Pakistan’s  per  capita  income  in  constant  prices  grew 
three-fold, that of the republic of Korea 23-fold. this dis-
crepancy in economic performance has been attributed 
largely to the differences in their educational development. 
even in 1950 the east asian country had an advantage in 
years of schooling, but by 2010 its educational develop-
ment reached nearly 12 years of schooling, equivalent to 
the average adult having completed secondary schooling, 
whereas Pakistan’s had not yet reached 6 years of school-
ing, a minimum for literacy.

similarly, both Ghana and the republic of Korea had 
a  GdP  per  capita  of  roughly  $300  in  1955.  By  1990  in 

real  terms,  the republic  of  Korea’s  GdP  had  increased 
to $7,500, while Ghana remained at its 1955 level. a third 
of  the  republic  of  Korea’s  growth  was  thanks  to  rapid 
increases in educational attainment (Banerji et al. 2010), 
during a period in which the country transformed manu-
facturing from a low-tech to a more capital- and technol-
ogy-intensive structure (Box Figure 1).

Manufacturing’s  slower  structural  change  reflects 
Pakistan’s slower educational development (Box Figure 2). 
In 1963 the country had a similar manufacturing structure 
to that in the republic of Korea, but in 2006, while Paki-
stan had a more than 50 percent share of manufacturing 
value added in low-tech industries, most value added in 
the republic of Korea came from high-tech industries.

Mismatch between skill demand and supply
Nearly  all  labour  markets  have  unemployment  and 
shortages of certain skills at the same time. Such a 

mismatch is due to the limited perspective of work-
ers on job opportunities, the time lag between basic 
skill development and employment, and the effects of 
structural change on employment.

Take India. It has many more university graduates 
with a degree in arts than the labour market can absorb,

Tunisia half of university graduates in chemistry are 
mismatched in their jobs, while in Lebanon 40 percent 
of the workforce is in jobs where they do not use their 
skills (Almeida, Behrman and Robalino 2012).

Supply  of  skilled  labour  may  not  always  match 
demand for two reasons. First, by the time demand has 
unfolded, it may be too late for firms to develop them 
internally in their own workforce. Second, demand is 
inadequate because firms have not well defined their real 
needs because of deficiencies in developing innovation 
strategies. In Tanzania some firms may have the poten-
tial to start innovating in manufacturing, but because 
they have not developed a strategy they fail to hire key 
staff in certain areas (MIT, POPC and UNIDO 2012).

change from agriculture to industry, a new set of skills 
is required – as is another change in skills when manu-
facturing shifts to R&D activities (Trilling and Fadel 
2009). Evidence from the European Union shows that 
industrial diversification and deepening lead to a grow-
ing need for medium- and high-skilled professionals 
(CEDEFOP  2008).  The  trend  is  similar  for  Brazil, 
China and India, where the rapid transition towards 

knowledge-intensive  manufacturing  is  expected  to 
create shortages of both high-skilled workers (such as 
engineers and scientists) and medium-skilled work-
ers (such as technicians and factory workers) by 2030 
(Manyika et al. 2012).

Structural change triggers a significant shift from 
unskilled to skilled labour. But is it possible to identify

moved from low- to high-tech production? Although 
in overall terms this can be done, we are confronted 
with a major constraint: huge sectoral heterogeneity 
for skill intensity can lead to unrealistic and mislead-
ing  generalizations.  Evidence  shows  that  activities 
within the same product group can have very differ-
ent skill intensities. For instance, Bruno et al. (2009) 
argue that at the International Standard Industrial 
Classification two-digit level, 8 of 24 sectors embody 
either  unskilled  or  skilled  activities.  Agroindustry, 
often considered a low-tech low-skill sector, has fish 
and meat processing requiring very low skill intensity, 
while manufacture of wines, liquors and malt require 
very high skill intensity. Similarly at the most sophisti-
cated end of manufacturing – electronics – skill inten-
sity varies hugely from assembly to design.

Still, the requirements for skill development gen-
erally change by a firm’s industrial deepening – low, 
intermediate and advanced. Each level calls for spe-
cific technological capabilities and skills, which can be 
developed with formal education and skill formation 
through technology-based training (Table 4.4).

The sectors likely to be present at each level are as 

follows:
•  Low level, simple assembly and processing. Sectors 
here tend to be labour-intensive with stable, well-
diffused technologies embodied mainly in capital 
equipment, having low R&D spending and sim-
ple  skill  requirements.  Labour  costs  are  often  a 
major element, and barriers to entry are quite low. 
The market as a whole tends to grow slowly, with 
an income elasticity of less than one. Particular 
consumer  products  have  high-quality  segments 
where brand names, skills, design and technologi-
cal competence are very important, but products 
of major interest to developing countries are in the 
lower quality segments, based on simple technolo-
gies and price rather than quality competition. The 
most representative sectors include textiles, gar-
ments, footwear and agroindustry.
Intermediate  level.  Sectors  at  this  level  are  the 
heartland  of  industrial  activity  of  catching-
up  countries,  comprising  the  bulk  of  skill  and 
scale-intensive technologies in capital goods and

intermediates. They have relatively complex tech-
nologies, moderate R&D spending and need some 
scientific  skills.  The  most  representative  sectors 
include engineering, transport equipment, chemi-
cals and other processing industries.

•  Advanced and deep industrial structure. These sec-
tors  have  fast-changing  technologies,  with  high 
R&D spending, high skills and prime emphasis 
on product design. The most innovative technolo-
gies  require  advanced-technology  infrastructure 
and close interactions among firms and between 
firms and research institutions. The most repre-
sentative sectors include electronic and electrical 
products, precision instruments, pharmaceutical 
and automobiles.
The  shift  from  low-level  industrial  deepening 
to  advanced  industrial  structures  entails  changes 
in technological capabilities and skill demand. The 
general trend is that as countries move from simple 
assembly technologies to being able to import, adapt 
and  operate  state-of-the-art  technologies,  the  skill 

profile gradually evolves from basic production skills 
to highly specialized professional skills.

This course also involves changes in skill acquisi-
tion through formal education and in-firm learning. 
Broadly, a solid primary and secondary education is 
fundamental for countries and low and intermediate 
levels. Although some forms of technical training may 
be needed, the emphasis is on developing basic literacy 
and numeracy skills to operate simple technologies. 
There is informal in-firm learning through repetition 
and through trial and error but no deliberate effort by 
firms to invest in skill development. Salaries at this 
level are low and workforce turnover high. Although 
there may be links to buyers and suppliers at the inter-
mediate level, the interaction does not generate learn-
ing spillovers.

The  structural  change  towards  advanced  indus-

technical background – there is an emphasis on uni-
versity  enrolment  in  technical  subjects  such  as  sci-
ence, mathematics, engineering and manufacturing. 
Romijn and Albaladejo (2002) show that specialized 
knowledge and experience in science and engineering 
matter more than general managerial capabilities and 
intermediate-level technical skills in explaining inno-
vation excellence by high-tech firms. At this end, firms 
invest heavily in skill development through in-firm 
training and through direct involvement in appren-
ticeship programmes. In particular, specialized train-
ing by semi-public technical and vocational education 
and training institutions helps firms co-share training 
costs while guaranteeing the applicability of skills in 
the workplace.

As  the  pattern  of  skills  required  to  compete  in 
modern manufacturing changes, so must the institu-
tions  and  methods  for  skill  formation.  Most  tradi-
tional methods of education and training are inad-
equate  today.  In  the  traditional  setting,  industrial 
development in technologically less-developed sectors 
often only entailed improving the quantity and qual-
ity of primary and secondary schooling and develop-
ing basic technical skills through on-the-job training. 
In the emerging competitive setting, greater empha-
sis is placed on high-level, specialized training, with 
more formalized on-the-job training and vocational 
education, featuring closer interaction between edu-
cational institutions and industry (UNIDO 2011a). 
Important here is developing the tacit knowledge (as 
opposed to formal or codified knowledge as taught 
in  formal  education   –  Box  4.3)  that  is  difficult  to 
transfer  to  other  users,  such  as  using  manufactur-
ing equipment. Firms that provide training are more 
likely to have higher levels of technology and skills 
(CEDEFOP 2012).

Educational attainment structures
While industrialization requires a labour force with 
progressively  higher  levels  of  skills  and  knowledge 
(with commensurately longer years of schooling), levels 
of skills and schooling educational attainment struc-
tures are also important for industrial transformation 

Box 4.3 
Tacit knowledge – not embodied in designs or 
blueprints

tacit knowledge is in the minds of scientists, special-
ist  workers  and  industry  entrepreneurs.  accessing 
it  requires  direct  contacts  feasible  only  where  firms 
are  located  close  together.  tacit  knowledge  is  more 
important in some industries that others, but is typi-
cally  important  in  the  early  stages  of  highly  innova-
tive  industries  before  product  and  process  designs 
become codified and standardized. Key mechanisms 
for transmitting tacit knowledge include start-ups by 
researchers or employees of other firms, labour mobil-
ity between firms and joint research initiatives.

and diversification into higher value added products 
(Nübler 2013b). The educational attainment structure 
shapes the mix, diversity and complexity of the social 
knowledge structure, thus determining the options 
space for structural and technological change. Based 
on the Barro-Lee dataset that provides information on 
the share of the labour force (older than 15 years) with 
no schooling, incomplete primary, complete primary, 
lower secondary, upper secondary and post-secondary 
as  highest  educational  attainment,  Nübler  (2013b) 
developed a typology of educational attainment struc-
tures  that  allows  for  analysing  a  country’s  options 
space. By sorting these seven educational categories in 
increasing order, the different lengths of the six bars 
suggest five different educational structures (Figure 
4.4; Box 4.4).

Empirical  analysis  of  educational  attainment 
structures  shows  that  the  strong  middle  structures 
(SM, SM+) provide the highest options for produc-
tive transformation, characterized by both industrial 
widening (broadening the manufacturing base) and 
industrial deepening (diversification into higher tech-
nology products; Nübler 2013c).

Advancement  Index  (ITA)  developed  by  UNIDO

Box 4.4 
Typology of educational attainment structures

L-shape educational structures with the median category 
being  non-schoolers  or  (complete  and  incomplete)  pri-
mary education show extremely low shares of upper and 
post-secondary education. L+ structures have the shape 
of an l-curve but with higher shares of upper and post-
secondary education.

Dual structures may be described as the composition 
of  distinct  education  structures  of  two  groups  (such  as 
rural and urban). It shows high levels of non-schoolers and 
incomplete primary education, but low shares of primary 
(like  the  l).  secondary  and  post-secondary  categories 
show a structure more similar to the strong middle struc-
ture – that is, it includes high shares of lower, upper and 
post-secondary education.

Missing  middle  (MM)  structures  demonstrate  high 
shares of primary and lower secondary education, very 
low shares of upper secondary education and high shares 
of post-secondary. MM countries have a bimodal struc-
ture with very low shares of lower and upper secondary 
education.  MM+  countries  show  a  trimodal  structure, 
differing from the MM structure, with significantly higher 
shares of lower secondary education, but lower shares of 
incomplete primary education.

Strong middle (sM) structures take the form of a bell 
curve with the median on primary, lower (medium catego-
ries) or upper secondary (high categories) education. as 
countries increase levels of average years of schooling, 
the median is shifted from primary to lower (sM) to upper 
secondary education (sM+).

highest), the ITA is a composite index based on the 
share of manufacturing in total production and exports 
and share of medium and high technology products in 
total production and exports. Analysis of educational 
attainment structures and the ITA shows that countries 
with strong middle education structures (SM, SM+) 
achieved ITA levels above 0.3 (Figure 4.5). Countries 

with ITA levels below this threshold are mainly small 
economies  and  transition  countries  that  have  either 
specialized in the services sector or on resource-based 
industries. By contrast, missing middle education struc-
tures (MM, MM+) define tighter boundaries and lim-
ited options for industrial and technological expansion. 
This is indicated by the lower ITA values of countries

with such structures, mainly ITA levels of below 0.2. 
Further, countries with L, L+ and dual education struc-
tures face the fewest options to industrialize. ITA val-
ues for all countries remain below 0.2. While countries 
with the L structure are almost exclusively below the 
0.1 ITA threshold, the L+ and the dual structures with 
their  higher  shares  of  secondary  and  post-secondary 
education can pass this threshold. But these countries 
developed competitiveness mainly in the garment and 
textile industries at low-tech levels.

Skill-biased technological change
Technological change (discussed in the next subsec-
tion) and greater pressures to compete have put a pre-
mium on high-level technical skills. This trend started 
early in the 20th century, causing a bias in techno-
logical  change  for  technology  that  uses  skills,  sug-
gesting that where skill-using industries are located, 
better jobs are created. (This was in direct contrast to 
19th century technological change, which was largely 
focused on skill saving or de-skilling as tasks previ-
ously undertaken by skilled artisans were replaced by 
repetitive factory-based operations.)

Accompanying this demand for skills was higher 
capital  investment,  so  that  skilled  labour  and  capi-
tal became complements not substitutes. Conte and 
Vivarelli  (2007),  among  others,  tested  the  comple-
mentarity  between  technological  innovation  and 
labour  skills.  They  used  a  dataset  of  almost  5,000 
observations  from  28  manufacturing  sectors  in  23 
countries. They found that capital deepening (a rising 
capital–labour ratio) was responsible for a relative shift 
in demand towards skilled labour.

The trend towards a skills bias during most of the 
20th century intensified from the late 1970s with the 
revolution in information and communications tech-
nology (ICT); the spread of computers and computer-
based production systems; and the changes in organi-
zation practice and design of products and processes 
that all this has allowed. Spitz (2004) reports that from 
1979 to 1999 employment in the Federal Republic of 
Germany shifted from manual labour to more analyti-
cal jobs. She considered that this change accounted for 
around half the educational upgrading during these 
years. And she found that skills in computer technology 
were complementary to analytical and interactive skills.

93

4“ There are two main sources of 

innovation – R&D investment and embodied 
technological change, where the innovation 
is embodied in new equipment

ICT has been described as a “general purpose tech-
nology”  with  pervasive  effects  across  the  economy, 
creating a continual process of technological improve-
ment leading to falling costs for users and a continual 
process  of  innovation  (Bresnahan  and  Trajtenberg 
1995).5 This is the equivalent of the key technological 
breakthroughs of earlier times like the printing press, 
steam power and electricity and also reflected in the 
similar patterns of spatial distribution between manu-
facturing in the early 20th century and services in the 
late 20th century (see Box 2.2 in Chapter 2).

ICT  and  computerization  more  widely  –  in 
increasing  demand  for  inputs  of  non-routine  cog-
nitive  and  manual  tasks  and  shifting  the  relative 
demand  for  labour  –  have  created  a  “polarization 
effect” in the employment structure of higher income 
economies (Autor, Levy and Murnane 2003). These 
countries generally show a falling employment share 
taken by middle-skill and middle-wage occupations, 
as the adoption of computer-based technologies has 
increased demand for educated and skilled workers 
(who can do non-routine abstract tasks) and for low-
wage, low-skill workers (who have manual flexibility 
and adaptability; Acemoglu and Autor 2010).

This skill bias has been explained by the rising sup-
ply of skilled workers in the technology-creating econ-
omies and may partly account for the fall in real wages 
of low-skilled workers (Jaumette and Tytell 2007). In 
developed economies it is now fairly well established 
that technological change in a skill-biased direction 
has been a key factor in creating a falling labour share 
in GDP, as unskilled jobs are replaced by capital. The 
significance for developing countries – as technology 
importers – is that the technology transferred to them 
has been created in response to market conditions in 
advanced economies.

The effect of such change has been put forward as 
one of the explanations as to why, unexpectedly, trade 
liberalization has only rarely been associated with the 
one of the key predictions of standard trade theory 
– a rise in relative wages for unskilled labour in low-
income  countries  (Arbache,  Dickerson  and  Green 
2004; Robbins 2003). If firms in developing countries 

are forced by competition and induced by trade liber-
alization to import best-practice technology – where 
there is little scope for factor substitution – this will 
raise the demand for skilled labour over unskilled and 
import a skill bias into the economy.

But skill-biased technological change is not auto-
matic in all industries in all developing countries. It 
did not, for example, occur in the sewing segment in 
the garment industry in Bangladesh (Fukunishi and 
Yamagata 2013).

Technology: a dominant driver of 
structural change
Technology  determines  overall  output  and  pro-
ductivity as well as labour productivity specifically. 
Although  labour  productivity  can  be  improved  by 
using technologies more efficiently over time, trends 
in its growth are closely linked to how new technology 
is applied and modified, and to what extent it creates 
or displaces jobs.

Job creation and destruction
Most of the debate on innovation’s impact on job num-
bers has focused on higher income economies. There 
are two main sources of innovation – R&D invest-
ment  and  embodied  technological  change  (ETC), 
where the innovation is embodied in new equipment. 
There are also two main types of innovation outputs: 
product  innovation  –  altering  the  product  mix  by 
creating either genuinely new products or products 
adapted from existing designs; and process innovation 
– altering the system of production to reduce costs or 
improve quality (Figure 4.6).

Although the distinction is not precise, the litera-
ture on innovation suggests that only complex prod-
uct  innovation  (delivered  mainly  by  large  firms  in 
high-tech sectors) relies on formal R&D, while pro-
cess innovation – where it is not so easy to single out 
pure innovation, diffusion and imitation – is much 
more related to ETC acquired by investment in new 
machinery and equipment and by purchasing exter-
nal technology incorporated in licences, consultancies 
and  know-how.6  Again  generalizing,  R&D  is  most

crucial in large firms and more advanced sectors, while 
ETC assumes a dominant role in small and medium-
size enterprises (SMEs) and more traditional sectors.

Thus theoretically innovation has two inputs and 
two outputs, with R&D mainly (but not only) related 

to product innovation and ETC mainly (but not only) 
related to process innovation, with the possibility of 
some  overlap  in  mixed  activities  which  entail  both 
product and process innovation.

The  main  implications  of  the  distinction  for 
employment are that product innovation creates jobs 
through the emergence of new markets, and that pro-
cess innovation creates a direct labour-saving effect, 
mainly related to introducing machines that allow the 
same output to be produced with fewer workers.

Although the expectation is that developing new 
markets through product innovation will create new 
jobs, this has to be balanced against the potential loss 
of jobs in the sectors producing the displaced prod-
ucts.  Many  process  innovations  are  intended  to  be 
labour saving but a number of dynamic “compensating 
mechanisms” exist that may offset these labour-saving 
effects in whole or in part, making it difficult to calcu-
late the exact net employment outcome of technologi-
cal change (Box 4.5).

But none of these mechanisms compensating for 
the direct displacement effect on jobs is automatic, 
and  to  work  they  require  particular  conditions  to 
hold. Economic theory has no precise answer for the 
ultimate employment impact of process innovation.

Box 4.5 
Labour-compensating mechanisms of technological change

Through  new  machines. the  same  process  innovations 
that displace workers in the product industries where the 
new machines are introduced create new jobs in the capi-
tal industries where the new machines are produced.

Through decreases in prices. although innovations involve 
the displacement of workers, these innovations lead to a 
decrease in the unit costs of production, and in a competi-
tive market this effect leads to decreasing prices; in turn, 
decreasing prices stimulate new demand for products and 
so additional production and employment.

Through new investments. In cases where the competi-
tive convergence is not direct, during the gap between the 
decrease in costs – due to technological progress – and 
the consequent fall in prices, extra-profits may be accu-
mulated  by  innovative  entrepreneurs.  these  profits  are 
invested, creating new output and new jobs.

Through  declines  in  wages. where  there  is  demand  for 
labour,  the  direct  effect  of  job-destructive  technologies 
may be compensated within the labour market. assum-
ing  free  competition  and  full  substitutability  between 
labour and capital, technological unemployment implies a 
decrease in wages and this should induce a reverse shift 
back to more labour-intensive technologies.

Through increases in incomes. trade unions may redis-
tribute part of the innovation rent back to the workforce 
and thus a portion of the cost savings due to innovation 
can  be  translated  into  higher  wage  income  and  hence 
higher consumption. this increase in demand leads to an 
increase in employment, which may compensate for the 
initial job losses due to process innovations.

4“ Innovators were found to employ a 

greater number of unskilled and female 
workers than non-innovators

Price and income mechanisms can counterbalance the 
direct job destruction caused by process innovation, 
but their effectiveness depends on many parameters 
such as the degree of competition, demand elasticity 
and the way business expectations are shaped.

Empirical studies of the innovation–employment 
links have focused largely on higher income econo-
mies and tend to show that product innovations are 
usually associated with employment growth, while the 
effect of process innovations is often negative. R&D 
spending has been shown to have a positive employ-
ment  effect,  principally  in  high-tech  sectors.7  Net 
employment usually rises with innovation, and gov-
ernment support for product development rather than 
technological change is more likely to lead to employ-
ment generation.

Work on a large database created from the World 
Bank Enterprise Surveys of 2002–2006 and covering 
more than 26,000 manufacturing establishments in 71 
countries confirms the employment–innovation link 
(Dutz et al. 2011). Firms that introduced a product or 
process innovation (judged by their own responses in 
the survey) had employment growth of 2.9 or 2.1 per-
centage points, respectively, above that of non-inno-
vating firms (controlling for all other factors). Process 
innovation had a positive employment effect overall, 
but  not  for  the  largest  enterprises  (more  than  200 
workers). Product innovation had a positive employ-
ment  effect,  which  was  larger  than  that  for  process 
innovation and was significant for all size categories.

Innovators  were  also  found  to  employ  a  greater 
number of unskilled and female workers than non-
innovators. But the link between process innovation 

and unskilled employment growth was weaker than 
with product innovation, and there is some evidence 
that non-process innovators may have had a stronger 
link  with  employment  of  unskilled  labour.  Female 
employment  in  developing  countries  was  strongly 
linked to innovation, while across the whole sample of 
countries it appeared to be linked to innovation only 
in new and medium-size enterprises.

Industrial organization: the 
underlying driver
The way an industry is organized has a profound influ-
ence on structural change through shifts in output, 
productivity, growth and employment. Important ele-
ments to be considered are firm size, production frag-
mentation, and spatial distribution and clustering.

Firm size
Average  firm  size  in  the  manufacturing  sector, 
measured  by  formal  sector  employees,  declined  in 
1981–2007 in all country income groups except for 
low-income countries, reflecting the fact that smaller 
firms dominated start-ups and employment growth 
(Table  4.5).  Further,  across  almost  all  branches  of 
manufacturing,  average  firm  size  is  lowest  in  high-
income  countries  and  highest  in  low-income  coun-
tries, reflecting the trend for the proportionate share 
of SMEs to rise with per capita income.8 The larger 
average firm size in the low-income group is likely to 
reflect  the  dualistic  manufacturing  structure  there, 
with formal manufacturing dominated by large pro-
ducers and a relatively large informal sector (not cov-
ered in the table), with many very small firms.

4“ While SMEs have proved a key driver 

of employment growth, they have not been 
a driver of productivity improvements 
within manufacturing in most cases

Several  formal  analyses  of  the  performance  of 
SMEs have been conducted using detailed databases 
compiled from the World Bank Enterprise Surveys. 
Defining SMEs as formal sector enterprises up to 250 
workers, Ayyagari, Beck and Demirguc-Kunt (2003) 
found that in the sample of up to 76 countries for the 
1990s  manufacturing  SMEs  accounted  for  32  per-
cent of total employment for the low-income group, 
compared with 54 percent for the middle-income and 
64  percent  for  the  high-income  groups.  Regression 
analysis of these data (controlling for country char-
acteristics and the starting level of per capita income) 
finds that the size of the SME sector is positively asso-
ciated with economic growth, though it does not sup-
port the interpretation that size causes higher growth. 
It seems that in the 1990s a rising share of SMEs in 
employment and income was a characteristic of fast-
growing economies.

The same database provides estimates of informal 
unregistered economic activity, which shows a clear 
tendency to decline as a share of national income as 
economies  grow.  Thus  the  rising  share  of  SMEs  is 
partly a result of declining informal activity, as previ-
ously unregistered firms shift into formal manufac-
turing. Perceived obstacles to the expansion of small 
firms, like constrained access to credit and the costs of 
starting a business, are associated with smaller shares 
of SMEs in economic activity at the country level.

Across all countries, firm size is a significant deter-
minant of employment growth and where there are 
more SMEs, regressions suggest that there is higher 
employment growth. Nurturing SMEs is conducive 
to employment growth. There is a slight tendency for 
this to be stronger at the smaller end of the SME scale 
(up to 100 workers), but a dummy for the size group 
101–250 is also significant. In countries with employ-
ment increases over the period covered by the surveys 
the  vast  majority  of  new  jobs  are  created  by  SMEs 
(defined in the broadest way as up to 250 employees). 
This negative association between size and employ-
ment growth holds even when controlling for the age 
of firms, unlike a recent finding for the United States 
(Haltiwanger, Jarmin and Miranda 2010). Thus it is 

not the case that the employment effect is due to new 
firms taking on more workers and tending to start as 
SMEs. But SMEs have a significant negative associa-
tion with productivity growth (again controlling for 
firm age). In addition, new smaller firms, as well as 
small mature firms (more than six years) tend to have 
lower productivity growth, allowing for the sector in 
which they operate (Ayyagari, Demirguc-Kunt and 
Maksimovic 2011). The results do not differ between 
groups of countries when they are separated by size of 
the informal sector.

Thus  it  appears  from  this  database  that  while 
SMEs have proved a key driver of employment growth, 
they have not been a driver of productivity improve-
ments within manufacturing in most cases. Promoting 
industrial SMEs to generate employment should be 
accompanied by efforts to upgrade them technologi-
cally, so that these firms also perform a positive role in 
capital accumulation.

The databases discussed above exclude informal 
and micro firms (fewer than five employees) and so do 
not capture much manufacturing in low-income coun-
tries. There, the informal economy forms the bulk of 
manufacturing employment, and growth of informal 
employment  is  usually  due  to  new  start-ups  rather 
than  to  the  expansion  of  informal  firms  (Sandefur 
2006).  In  such  countries  few  informal  enterprises 
appear to graduate to formal status and of those that 
do  even  fewer  grow  to  become  medium-size  enter-
prises. Efforts to link the size of the informal sector 
to business environment conditions – like the cost of 
starting a business and enforcing a contract, and rigid-
ity of employment laws – have found some association, 
though it is clear that other factors, such as difficulty 
in accessing credit and general macroeconomic condi-
tions, also work to explain the size of informal activity.

Production fragmentation
Structural  change  is  driven  by  the  extent  to  which 
firms can segment the production process and locate 
production  to  minimize  unit  production  costs. 
Producing a final product in one location may offer 
little scope for changing the capital–labour ratio. But

4“ Product fragmentation through the 

spread of global and domestic production 
networks allows the retention of manufacturing 
jobs in industry segments where such 
jobs might otherwise have been lost

once it becomes possible to fragment production into 
a series of stages, some stages will inevitably be more 
labour intensive than others and, with low transport 
and communication costs, it may be cost-effective to 
move these to a low-wage area.

The parts of the production process where wage 
costs become the critical determinant of location are 
simple assembly of parts or simple forms of product 
processing, which are largely manufacturing by hand. 
Assembly can relate to technologically simple products 
like toys or sports goods and processing to the sewing 
of materials for clothing. Highly sophisticated elec-
tronic products, such as iPhones, are also assembled 
in low-wage areas (see The role of global value chains in 
Chapter 5).

Over time with higher savings in these economies 
the capital–labour ratio will rise again, and jobs will 
move to locations with the lowest unit labour costs. 
But in the short run the impact in depressing prices of 
labour-intensive manufactures and in increasing com-
petition among producers of such goods is substan-
tial. Thus product fragmentation through the spread 
of global and domestic production networks allows 
the retention of manufacturing jobs in industry seg-
ments where such jobs might otherwise have been lost 
through substitution through process innovation.

Spatial distribution and clustering
Structural change and the move from low to high tech 
are driven by the way firms are distributed spatially 
and able to collaborate and cluster. Geographical prox-
imity between producers as a means of maximizing 
spillovers and other external effects, like labour avail-
ability, has received prominence in discussions relating 
to agglomeration effects and provides a rationale for 
creating special economic zones and related measures 
to encourage firms to cluster. A higher level of popula-
tion density is positively associated with a higher level 
of manufacturing employment for 15 of 16 industries 
(see Figure 3.22 in Chapter 3). Key potential advan-
tages for a firm being close to other producers are:
•  Access to a pool of skilled labour drawn to the area 

by the presence of similar firms.

•  Spillovers though the sharing (or copying) of tech-
nological or marketing knowledge and the sharing 
of access to equipment and other facilities.
Joint  learning  and  developing  of  innovations 
through continuous interaction and working on 
the same problem.

• 

•  Opportunities for jointly marketing products and 
benefiting from buyers that can source all product 
from one location.

•  A network of specialist suppliers drawn to the area 
by enough user firms near the suppliers to reduce 
transport costs, to help ensure timely delivery and 
to reduce coordination difficulties.
A distinction has been drawn between localization 
(agglomeration) effects of clusters of similar producers 
and urbanization effects of clusters of diverse produc-
ers. The hypothesis is that agglomeration effects are 
more important for standardized and mature indus-
tries, while urbanization effects are more important 
for  newer  industries  where  producers  in  different 
subsectors but similar technological needs can benefit 
from the dynamic environment created by a diversity 
of activities (World Bank 2009).

In  developed  economies  clusters  of  relatively 
small firms have been at the forefront of some break-
through  technologies  (Audretsch  2002).  Many 
small-firm  innovations  have  been  concentrated  in 
fairly  narrow  areas  (such  as  those  around  Boston 
and San Francisco in the United States). This tight 
localization has been put down to the critical impor-
tance of tacit knowledge (see Box 4.3). Such an expla-
nation for the United States has parallels in China, 
the Republic of Korea, Taiwan Province of China 
and Thailand. But even in activities not highly inno-
vative, small firms in some developing countries – 
chiefly in Asia and Latin America – have found it 
advantageous  to  group  in  clusters.  Sectors  include 
footwear (Brazil and Mexico), metalworking, sim-
ple  engineering  and  electronics  (India),  textiles 
(India  and  the  Republic  of  Korea),  surgical  goods 
(Pakistan), furniture (Indonesia) and software devel-
opment (India, Uruguay and more recently Kenya; 
Weiss 2011).

4“ Agglomeration effects associated with 

clusters can be an important driver for 
development and structural change in industry

Empirical work reveals a raft of experiences among 
10 clusters in low- and lower middle-income countries 
(UNIDO 2009). Collaboration between firms varies 
greatly from the casual exchange of tools and infor-
mation to direct collaboration in sharing orders and 
training. In some cases clear specialization emerges 
with some firms as parts and components suppliers 
to other cluster-based firms; in others growing firms 
cease to rely on external suppliers and start to make 
some of the components they need. In some clusters 
social networks and cultural cohesion remain impor-
tant; in others these are replaced by impersonal mar-
ket relationships with external agents or traders stimu-
lating links between firms.

Successful  clusters  allow  small  firms  to  expand 
and increase employment and even larger and more 
technologically sophisticated firms may benefit from 
being in a cluster. Yet success depends partly on the 
wider economic climate as well as firm-specific charac-
teristics and the operating environment. In reviewing 
the evidence on clusters in Africa, Dinh et al. (2012) 
suggest that only the cluster in Mauritius has been 
an unqualified success for employment and growth. 
They highlight problems: targeting of inappropriate 
activities for the cluster, poor choices of location, poor 
infrastructure inside and outside the cluster, imple-
mentation  difficulties  and  lack  of  long-term  policy 
credibility for continued support.

The success of special economic zones in East Asia, 
particularly China, as an institutional arrangement to 
support clusters has been well documented. But such 
success with zones elsewhere has been mixed – espe-
cially  disappointing  in  Africa.  Sonobe  and  Otsuka 
(2011),  contrasting  experiences  in  Africa  and  Asia, 
find that Africa’s clusters are mainly “survival clus-
ters” generating low incomes and lacking innovation 
and dynamism. They suggest that successful clusters 
are based on “multi-faceted innovation” that incorpo-
rates improvements in product quality, branding, use 
of reliable input suppliers and effective distribution, 
combined with an appropriate management system 
to allow cluster-based firms to control stocks, labour 
and financing. Developing the argument further using 

case  studies,  Sonobe,  Higuchi  and  Otsuka  (2012) 
regard a shortage of managerial capacity as one of the 
distinguishing features of unsuccessful clusters, espe-
cially in Africa.

The conclusion is that agglomeration effects asso-
ciated with clusters can be an important driver for 
development and structural change in industry if the 
manufacturing process can be segmented and if opti-
mal low-cost production opportunities can be found 
in different locations.

Business environment: a basic driver 
for structural change
The business environment has been highlighted as a 
key influence on enterprise growth and employment 
– for example, by World Development Report 2005 
(World Bank 2005). The investment climate has been 
defined  as  “the  many  location-specific  factors  that 
shape the investment opportunities and incentives for 
firms to invest productively, create jobs and expand” 
(World Bank 2005, p. 2). It covers aspects of regula-
tion and corruption linked to the cost of doing busi-
ness, as well as broad issues like the quality of infra-
structure,  the  skill  base,  the  difficulty  of  accessing 
sources of finance and aspects of the labour market 
– all crucial in low-income economies.

The effectiveness of the court system in enforcing 
contracts  is  important,  particularly  once  countries 
reach a threshold per capita income. At lower incomes 
where transactions may be less complex, a weak legal 
system can be replaced by personal relationship-based 
transactions that enable business development. But at 
all country incomes it appears that risk of expropria-
tion of a firm’s profits through informal payments and 
bribes is a negative influence on growth.9 Small firms 
have been found to be more hindered by regulations 
than  medium-size  and  large  enterprises,  for  which 
access to finance and good-quality infrastructure are 
more  important  (Aterido,  Hallward-Driemeier  and 
Pagés 2007).

Barriers  to  entry  such  as  minimum  capital 
requirements, delays in obtaining permits and mul-
tiple procedures have been shown to have negative

sector, can help use key drivers, such as wages, 
technology, and education and skills, to change

generation while transforming the economy

effects on start-up numbers and productivity. They 
are expected to have the most deleterious impact in 
frontier sectors (where technological change is most 
rapid) and in sectors where natural barriers to entry 
(for example, due to initial investment requirements) 
are relatively low (Djankov 2009). There is evidence 
that  modest  changes  to  the  business  environment 
have  little  impact  on  firm  behaviour,  particularly 
in highly regulated environments, and that reforms 
undertaken  as  a  package  have  a  stronger  impact 
than reforms undertaken independently or sequen-
tially (Klapper and Love 2010). A common example 
in the context of combining reforms relates to the 
removal of the investment licensing system in India, 
where a positive growth and employment effect was 
only found in states with less restrictive labour mar-
kets (Aghion, Algan and Cahuc 2008; Aghion et al. 
2008).

Poor  infrastructure  is  a  major  constraint  on 
employment growth in low-income economies, par-
ticularly for export activities, as shown in a wide range 
of  survey  data.  Infrastructure  can  drive  structural 
change in industries through the costs they cause. But 
in less developed countries it is simply the existence 
(or absence) that shapes change in industries. From 
surveys of firms in Bangladesh, China, Ethiopia and 
Pakistan, measures of infrastructure (such as power 
losses and days to install a telephone line) dominate 
business  environment  indicators  in  an  analysis  of 
firm performance (Dollar, Hallward-Dreimeier and 
Mengistae 2005).

Recent analysis based on the large database cre-
ated by the World Bank Enterprise Surveys reveals 
that aspects of the investment climate are important 
for employment growth across manufacturing firms in 
different size categories and countries. Controlling for 
these characteristics, Aterido and Hallward-Dreimeier 
(2010) find that employment growth in low-income 
countries  is  significantly  related  to  reduced  power 
outages and access to finance. Measured corruption 
and regulation (as proxied by management time spent 
with officials) have no significant impact on industrial 
development.

Dinh, Mavridis and Nguyen (2010) used the same 
large database to assess the most binding constraint 
on employment growth. They asked respondents to 
rate different constraints on a scale of 1 (minor) to 4 
(severe). Overall labour regulation appeared as only a 
minor obstacle with electricity, taxation, corruption 
and access to finance the most severe.10

In conclusion, while regulations and control may 
impede growth in manufacturing in some circum-
stances,  particularly  in  low-income  Sub-Saharan 
countries, they are less central than the quality of 
infrastructure  and  the  system  of  financial  inter-
mediation.  More  generally,  governments,  working 
alongside the private sector, can help use key driv-
ers,  such  as  wages,  technology,  and  education  and 
skills,  to  change  manufacturing  industry  and  so 
boost  employment  generation  while  transforming 
the economy.

Notes
1.  For example, Manyika et al. (2012) suggest they 
are  most  important  in  the  category  of  labour-
intensive  tradables,  which  are  activities  with  a 
high labour intensity (up to 35 hours per $1,000 
of value added) where price competition is strong 
and  the  ability  to  respond  to  market  trends 
quickly is critical. For developing countries as a 
group, labour-intensive tradables are estimated at 
10 percent of value added.

2.  To be wholly accurate, comparisons such as these 
should  use  long-run  equilibrium  real  exchange 
rates to convert local wage costs to a common for-
eign currency. These World Bank efficiency cal-
culations test for the effect of real exchange rate 
changes.

3.  Private returns to education are calculated based 
on incremental earnings. They normally exceed 
estimated social returns because in most coun-
tries individuals do not meet the full costs of their 
education. Wider externalities from education are 
difficult to incorporate in these calculations.

4.  This  argument  applies  less  to  Latin  American 
economies  where  educational  attainment  is

are  a  fairly  high  proportion  of  total  exports. 
Similarly, Bangladesh and Pakistan also appear to 
be exceptions, where export expansion has been 
based on relatively low-skill products; see Machin 
and van Reenen (1998).

between higher income economies; see Castaldi 
et al. (2009).

6.  Conte and Vivarelli (2005) found robust and sig-
nificant evidence that R&D increases the likeli-
hood of introducing product innovation.

7.  Bogliacino, Piva and Vivarelli (2012) using a panel 
of European firm data find a positive employment 
effect of R&D in these sectors but not in techno-
logically more mature manufacturing sectors.

8. 

In three two-digit branches (18, 31, 33) average 
firm size is highest in lower middle-income coun-
tries as opposed to low-income countries; even in 
the latter in 11 of 18 branches, average firm size 
has fallen since the early 1980s.

9.  Beck,  Demirguc-Kunt  and  Levine  (2005)  find 
that speed of courts in resolving disputes has no 
impact  on  firm  performance  while  managerial 
time  spent  dealing  with  regulators  and  bribes 
paid  has  a  negative  effect.  Similarly,  Acemoglu 
and Johnson (2005) find protection from expro-
priation (what they term “property rights insti-
tutions”) always to be statistically significant in 
explaining firm performance.

4Chapter 5
Trade and foreign direct investment as 
external drivers of structural change

Trade in manufactured goods is a key driver of struc-
tural change through four mechanisms: revenues from 
trade (generating resources for high-tech investments); 
pressure from buyers (accelerating learning and pro-
ductivity); access to technology; and imports of capital 
goods.

But trade liberalization has not enhanced struc-
tural change in all regions: while East Asia has become 
one of the most important manufacturing production 
networks, aided by liberalization, Latin America has 
seen deindustrialization and growth-reducing struc-
tural change in the 1990s and 2000s.1 In East Asia 
industrial policies were key to transform opportuni-
ties coming from the global market into structural 
change–driven industrialization. But as the outcome 
of trade openness policies can be so different depend-
ing on the effectiveness of state intervention, a sample 
of 44 countries on different continents offered only 
modest  empirical  evidence  of  a  strong  relationship 
between trade openness and structural change.

Trade  openness  is  thus  an  opportunity  –  and  a 
threat for low-income countries. Excessive specializa-
tion in low-tech manufacturing may be a risk if these 
countries  have  too  much  exposure  to  international 
markets, which increases volatility of export revenues 
and presents a consequent higher risk of non-sustained 
growth. Countries with a diversified manufacturing 
portfolio and the capacity to produce high-tech goods 
with few competitors, reflecting a high level of past 
structural change, are better equipped to absorb this 
risk.

The  impact  of  trade  openness  on  employment 
generation through manufacturing structural change 
is mediated by two mechanisms: labour-saving tech-
niques and the extent of mechanization of production 
processes;  and  whether  developing  country  exports 
are facing demand from buying countries that can-
not  be  sustained  in  the  long  run.  But  the  negative 
impact on employment of manufacturing structural 
change based on labour saving or volatile demand can 

be compensated for by industrial policies that achieve 
one or more of the following: ensuring that output 
growth in higher productivity sectors is strong enough 
to make up for the downward effects of employment 
growth; diversifying business activities towards more 
(highly productive) sectors and thus broadening the 
range and volume of total output; and leading to pro-
ductivity  changes  that  significantly  stimulate  local 
economic activity through multiplier effects.

Global value chains (GVCs) now underpin inter-
national  trade.  A  country’s  production  structure  is 
determined by its ability to join, stay part of or move 
up  GVCs,  and  technological  upgrading  is  the  best 
long-term strategy for preserving a country’s participa-
tion in them. Still, despite growing product fragmen-
tation and increasing international trade, the role of 
GVCs may be narrower in the future because of physi-
cal limits to product fragmentation and transaction 
costs.

Structural change can work to derail any “race to 
the bottom”, where firms in rich countries are tempted 
to relocate to low-income countries with lower labour 
costs, less restrictive labour laws and weaker monitor-
ing of labour conditions and environmental impacts. 
Governments – especially in low- and middle-income 
countries – should steer trade to stimulate produc-
tivity  through  knowledge  diffusion,  research  and 
development (R&D) and learning-by-doing spillover 
effects. Bilateral investment treaties and multilateral 
cooperation can help ensure that cross-border invest-
ment and trade are conducive to low-income countries 
(see Chapter 9).

Finally,  as  with  trade  openness,  foreign  direct 
investment (FDI) is not a one-way bet: it can be a major 
force in promoting manufacturing structural change 
through diversifying production and exports, gener-
ating spillovers, creating more backward and forward 
linkages and improving local business conditions (see 
Box 9.1 in Chapter 9). Yet only when it is properly inte-
grated with local economies can they reap the benefits.

102

“ An increase of trade openness is a growth 

opportunity for a country only if local resources 
can be deployed in adequate quantities to 
produce goods for the external market

Trade as a likely driver of structural 
change
Demand  for  manufactured  goods  from  advanced 
countries represented the engine of growth in East 
Asia and many other developing regions adopting an 
export-led  structural  change  approach.  Expanding 
trade  increases  business  opportunities  for  low-  and 
middle-income countries. As pointed out by Freund 
(2009), the elasticity of trade to income rose from 1.77 
in the 1960s to 3.69 in the 2000s, but not all develop-
ing countries outside East Asia took advantage of the 
market expansion.

Weiss (2005) suggested several factors conducive 

to structural change based on trade openness:
•  Manufactures face an initial stage of import sub-
stitution when domestic production can capture 
the market served by imports.

•  Growth of manufacturing output is more valuable 
at the margin than the same growth of agricul-
ture or services, due to externalities and dynamic 
increasing returns to scale.

•  Export-oriented growth may lead to further FDI 

and growth.

•  Exporting exposes firms to foreign competition, 
technology and marketing, leading to productivity 
gains that would not be obtained from sales on the 
domestic market.
Trade in turn improves technology and productiv-
ity in four main ways. First, the increase in revenues 
from trade integration induces exporters to upgrade 
technology  (Bustos  2011).  Second,  it  exposes  firms 
to forms of competition not present in the domestic 
market. Third, it improves quality standards and raises 
the efficiency of production processes to international 
levels as foreign suppliers exert pressure over domes-
tic suppliers (Weiss 2005). Fourth, it provides access 
to advanced capital equipment and R&D, and thus 
knowledge, as modern technologies are produced by 
a few developed economies. Empirical studies present 
evidence of this (such as Coe and Helpman 1995).

But trade cannot be the only driver of structural 
change, according to much theoretical work and anec-
dotal  evidence.  Even  Wacziarg  and  Welch  (2008), 

who argued that that open trade regimes experienced 
average annual growth about 1.5 percentage points 
faster  after  than  before  liberalization,  acknowledge 
that trade openness works only if countries have the 
right business conditions. Political stability, commit-
ment to trade policies, the non-existence of counterac-
tive policies and the right macroeconomic conditions 
are all factors that may help make trade liberalization 
a success. The creation and strengthening of institu-
tions protecting property rights, maintaining macro-
economic stability, regulating market participants and 
managing conflicts are also essential to boost tech-
nological upgrading and productivity (Rodrik 2001). 
Ocampo and Taylor (1998) add that an increase of 
trade openness is a growth opportunity for a country 
only if local resources can be deployed in adequate 
quantities to produce goods for the external market. 
Domestic production capabilities have to be already in 
place in order to respond to international competition, 
improve technology and exploit trade opportunities 
from increased liberalization.

In sum, the literature suggests that trade liberaliza-
tion is not a precondition for structural change, and 
that its impact depends on the economic context and 
quality of industrial policies.

When trade works
In 1960 the Republic of Korea was poorer than many 
countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. It now leaves African 
countries far behind. Most explanations of the wider 
East  Asian  “growth  miracle”  stress  export  orienta-
tion and structural change towards high-tech exports, 
which climbed steeply during 1985–1998 (Table 5.1).
Beyond  trade  openness,  industrial  policy  also 
played a crucial role in the East Asian miracle, steer-
ing structural change through manufactured exports. 
Many governments in the region implemented poli-
cies to improve the competitiveness of firms and pro-
mote export-led growth. They provided credit through 
state-supported  banks,  restricted  competition  from 
imports, constrained new domestic competitors and 
developed export-marketing institutions (Stiglitz and 
Charlton 2006).

When trade does not work
Pieper  (1998)  argues  that  Brazil  formally  started 
implementing  trade  liberalization  policies  in  1990. 
Until then its manufacturing sector absorbed labour 
with  employment  growth  rates  above  the  national 
average  at  about  4  percent  a  year,  associated  with 
negative annual rates of productivity growth. After 
trade liberalization manufacturing stopped absorbing 
labour, and gains in manufacturing productivity were 
associated with overall growth stagnation.

Jobs released from the restructuring of industry 
prompted  by  trade  liberalization  in  Latin  America 
(and in Africa) created two different negative mecha-
nisms. First, the excess labour was absorbed by less-
productive  activities,  such  as  agriculture  and  the 
informal sector (or even fed into unemployment), and 
for this reason the contribution of structural change 
to  productivity  was  negative  (Figure  5.1).  Second, 
especially in poor countries, structural change often 
moved  activities  towards  sectors  with  a  low  labour 
intensity (albeit with a high productivity) such as min-
ing and quarrying. In poor countries with a mining 
sector that has weak links to the rest of the economy, 
few people are employed with very high labour pro-
ductivity – labour productivity is 136 times larger in 
mining than in agriculture in Malawi, for example 
(McMillan and Rodrik 2011).

Cimoli  and  Katz  (2003)  argue  that  these  fac-
tors, alongside undervalued exchange rates, may have

hampered  Latin  America’s  attempts  to  upgrade  its 
industrial value chain through liberalizing its trade poli-

pattern of technological accumulation or a narrowed 
productivity gap with the United States and Europe.

McMillan and Rodrik (2011) identify several fac-
tors that cause structural change to either enhance or

5“ The rigidity of the labour market reduces the 

absorption of released labour when trade openness 
pushes non-competitive firms out of the market

hamper growth and employment. The larger the share 
of agricultural employment, for example, the larger the 
opportunities for growth-enhancing structural change, 
as many people can be shifted from lower to higher 
productivity activities. Similarly, policies to overvalue 
the exchange rate may also be beneficial, stimulating 
export diversification and growth. Conversely, special-
ization in the production and export of commodities 
does not represent an incentive to upgrade, while the 
rigidity of the labour market reduces the absorption of 
released labour when trade openness pushes non-com-
petitive firms out of the market.

Some evidence about the trade openness–
structural change relationship
To garner some evidence about this complex relation-
ship, data for the openness of trade in manufacturers 
(expressed as the ratio between manufactured imports 
and  exports  and  GDP)  and  for  structural  change2 
(expressed as the value added in high-tech manufac-
turing divided by the value added in medium-tech and 
low-tech manufacturing) was plotted for 44 countries 
for 1997 and 2007 (Figures 5.2–5.5). All figures are 

divided into quadrants by a horizontal and a vertical 
line representing the average structural change index 
and  the  average  trade  openness  index  in  the  sam-
ple in 1997 and 2007 for four continents (Asia, the 
Americas, Africa and Europe).

The  relationship  between  trade  openness  and 
structural change is in fact weak. A regression analysis 
between structural change and trade openness with the 
1997 and 2007 data revealed a statistically insignificant 
relationship, even though the data suggested the exist-
ence of a positive correlation (0.17 in 1997 and 0.19 in 
2007).3 Countries are scattered in all four segments of 
the trade openness/structural change diagram.

The  upper-left  quadrant  encompasses  countries 
that  were  successful  in  upgrading  their  economies 
towards  high-tech  manufacturing  and  that  are  not 
heavily  exposed  to  trade  in  manufactures,  as  such 
trade (exports plus imports normalized by GDP) rep-
resents a share of national GDP below the average. 
This group includes the Republic of Korea (see Figure 
5.2) and the United States (see Figure 5.3), with high 
production of capital-intensive sectors and fairly low 
exposure to trade openness.

China during the 1980s encouraged by rising labour 
and rent costs, Hong Kong SAR China still remains 
an economy with prominent printing, food and tex-
tile industries within the manufacturing sector, even 
though the services sector is now predominant in the 
overall economy.

The  lower-left  quadrant  brings  together  low-
income  countries  characterized  by  a  low  degree  of 
trade openness, reflected in economic isolation, and 
low  structural  change.  The  countries  in  this  group 
include Ethiopia, Malawi and the United Republic of 
Tanzania (see Figure 5.4). Their position in the lower-
left quadrant also reflects their low capacity to exploit 
international business opportunities.

The upper-right quadrant includes Malaysia and 
Singapore, which are highly exposed to trade openness 
and have succeeded in upgrading their economies with 
a very competitive high-tech industry (see Figure 5.2).
No  Latin  American  countries  upgraded  their 
industrial  production  despite  the  increasing  trade 
openness  over  time  (see  Figure  5.3).  Among  the 
high-income  countries,  those  in  Southern  Europe 
such as Italy and Spain downgraded theirs to below 

the average structural change index (see Figure 5.5). 
Countries in Eastern Europe are quite varied, with 
Poland and the Russian Federation having low trade 
openness and low structural change, and the Czech 
Republic and Hungary having high trade openness 
and high structural change (see Figure 5.5).

Over  1997–2007  both  the  average  structural 
change  index  and  trade  openness  index  increased 
(from 0.48 to 0.61 and from 0.52 to 0.61, respectively), 
indicating that over 10 years the 44 countries became 
more  successful  in  implementing  structural  change 
and on average more interconnected globally.

If the evidence on the relationship between struc-
tural  change  and  trade  openness  is  ambiguous,  the 
data are clearer in showing that excessive specializa-
tion in low-tech manufacturing may represent a risk 
if countries are too exposed to the international mar-
ket through trade. Concentration in a few categories 
of  manufactured  goods  (or  commodities)  increases 
the volatility of export revenue and generates a higher 
risk of stop-start economic growth. This latter risk 
is  reduced  if  countries  have  heavily  changed  their 
structure, as countries producing goods with a high

5“ Structural change improves both the quality of 

goods and widens – or diversifies – the product mix

technology content have less competition from global 
producers and are more likely to be resilient to shocks 
in manufacturing that could feed through to the rest 
of the economy.

Countries with the highest export concentration 
have the widest fluctuations in export revenue. They 
are often least developed countries with a high depend-
ency on commodities (Table 5.2). Countries unable to 
diversify their economy towards greater technological 
complexity are more likely to see economic instability. 
With  the  “commodification”  of  low-tech  manufac-
tured goods, economies that do not upgrade industrial 
production are more exposed to market fluctuations 
than  those  relying  on  the  production  of  high-tech 
goods (Kaplinsky 1993).

Structural change and diversification are strongly 
interconnected.  Structural  change  improves  both 
the quality of goods and widens – or diversifies – the 
product mix.

The  potential  for  quality  upgrading  varies  by 
category.  Agricultural  and  natural  resources  tend 
to have lower potential for this than manufactures 
(Papageorgiou and Spatafora 2012). For low-income 
countries at early stages of development, expansion 
to  manufacturing  may  be  a  necessary  first  step  to 
secure the gains from quality improvement. Within 
manufacturing,  structural  change  takes  place  as 
diversification from labour-intensive industries, such 
as  textiles  and  wearing  apparel,  to  industries  with 
high skill, capital and technology intensity, such as 
advanced  machinery,  automobiles  and  chemicals 
(UNIDO 2012b).

Structural change of low-income countries towards 
high-tech sectors may help curb the negative effects of 
trade openness on employment and value added. This 
is because in a globalized world trade openness may 
lower manufacturing employment if developing coun-
tries suffer labour release (due to trade liberalization) 
that  the  natural  resources  sector  can  only  partially 
absorb. And it may reduce value added if countries 
cannot diversify into high-tech non-mining manufac-
turing sectors.

We find that countries with the lowest openness 
to trade in manufactures and the highest structural 
change broadly correspond to the group of countries 
with the highest GDP per capita, such as Canada (see 
Figure 5.3) and the United Kingdom (see Figure 5.5). 
They  are  also  the  countries  with  the  lowest  GDP 
growth  fluctuations  over  the  period.  Countries 
with high trade openness and low structural change 
are  those  with  the  highest  GDP  growth  volatility 
(Table 5.3).

Among the group of countries with the highest 
trade openness, those with higher structural change 
show  lower  growth  volatility.  Countries  with  low 
trade openness in manufactures and low structural 
change have lower GDP growth volatility than coun-
tries with higher trade openness, but the difference 
is narrow. This is partly because the group of coun-
tries with a low openness to trade in manufactures 
and low structural change includes Kuwait, Malawi 
and Oman, which are exposed to fluctuations of pri-
mary commodity markets (oil for Kuwait and Oman, 
tobacco for Malawi).

Thus two lessons emerge from the coefficients of 

variation for 1997–2007:
•  Countries with the highest openness to trade in 
manufactures experience the highest fluctuations 
of GDP growth.

•  Given  a  certain  degree  of  openness  to  trade  in 
manufactures  (high  or  low),  higher  structural 
change helps stabilize economic performance.

Trade, structural change and employment 
creation
The impact of trade-based industrial structural change 
on employment is not straightforward. As discussed in 
the previous chapter, manufacturing stimulates struc-
tural change and employment through productivity 
growth, which is derived from specialization, learning 
and agglomeration economies, as well as from econo-
mies of scale. As labour and capital move into higher 
productivity activities, average productivity increases. 
A  more  productive  economy  encourages  additional 
demand for services and industrial products, which 
generates profitable investment opportunities and a 
growing demand for labour (UNCTAD 2010a).

Two important mechanisms may, however, con-
strain  employment  generation  (ILO  2012):  labour-
saving  techniques  and  mechanization  are  increas-
ingly becoming substitutes for human labour. Even in 
developing countries endowed with abundant labour 
relative to capital, technology transferred to them is 
often labour saving as it reflects the market conditions 
of  technology-exporting  advanced  countries.  Thus, 
the opportunity to absorb labour in manufacturing 
may be cut off prematurely (discussed in Skill-biased 
technological change in Chapter 4). Further, structural 
shifts  have  been  based  on  export-led  strategies  and 
continuing global demand, often bolstered by a rise in 
debt in many developed nations, which is unsustain-
able in the long run.

To ensure that trade is positive for employment 
generation, government policies will need to ensure 
that:
•  Output growth in the higher productivity sectors 
is strong enough to make up for the downward 
effect of productivity growth (UNCTAD 2010a).
•  Diversification  expands  business  activities  of 
developing  countries  towards  high-productivity 
sectors so that the scope and volume of output can 
be increased.

•  Changes of productivity stimulate local economic 

activities through multiplier effects.
An increase of exports of developing countries may 
stimulate direct effects (additional labour demand to 
produce output), indirect effects (additional labour 
demand for intermediate inputs) and induced effects 
(additional production and labour deriving from the 
increase of household spending). Chen et al. (2012) 
report that for every $1,000 of Chinese total exports 
in 2007, domestic value added estimated at $591 and 
employment at 0.096 person-years (Table 5.4).

The role of global value chains

Global value chains and structural change
Chapter 4 showed that structural change is driven by 
the extent to which firms can segment the produc-
tion process and locate production to minimize unit

production  costs.  Thus  product  fragmentation  has 
local and global dimensions – this subsection focuses 
on the global dimensions.

International trade has surged since the 1960s, far 
outpacing growth in GDP and becoming more frag-
mented since the 1980s. Domestic content accounts 
for  only  about  half  the  total  exports  of  the  most 
important manufacturing country, China, and even 
less (18 percent) of its processed exports (Koopman, 
Wang and Wei 2008). China’s exports in intermedi-
ate goods are growing faster than those of other Asian 
countries, and China is emerging not only as the cen-
tre of production but also as a leading processing hub 
in the region, being a prominent participant in global 
value chains (see Figure 2.7 in Chapter 2). Developing 
countries take advantage of GVCs because the increase 
in demand for intermediate goods and services creates 
opportunities for new firms and categories of work-
ers to move into more complex and innovative activi-
ties (Sturgeon and Memedovic 2010). For this reason 
trade in intermediate goods is usually considered a 

110

good proxy for the size of GVCs. Global imports of 
intermediate goods are stable at more than 50 percent 
of the total (Figure 5.6).

Beyond traditional competitiveness drivers (pro-
duction costs), a country’s competitiveness can now 
be measured on its capacity to join, stay in and move 
up  a  GVC  (Box  5.1).  Technological  upgrading  – 
 characterized by dynamic movement along the value 
chain towards production stages with higher growth 
potential  that  leads  to  structural  change  improve-
ments  –  represents  the  best  long-term  strategy  for 
protecting and promoting a country’s participation 
in GVCs (Cattaneo et al. 2013). East Asian firms in 
the  apparel  market  upgraded  along  the  GVC  with 
the shift from input assembly to original brand-name 
manufacturing, where firms design and sell their own 
branded products (Gereffi and Memedovic 2009).

But GVCs also pose challenges to firms in devel-
oping countries, the most important of which is that 
trade is unlikely to maintain its dynamism, as there 
are physical limits and transaction costs to product 
fragmentation. Elasticity of trade to income seems to 
have peaked in the 1990s (Table 5.5).

Box 5.1 
Value chains development as an effective policy tool for promoting inclusive and sustainable growth: 
Malaysia’s palm oil value chain

International best practice shows, that the identification 
of high-growth potential value chains and their promotion 
can be a fundamental driver for inclusive and sustainable 
growth.

In Malaysia the palm oil sector has notably contrib-
uted to the durable socioeconomic growth that over the 
last 3 decades, with the generation of long-term jobs and 
balanced revenue distribution, increased national value-
added and export revenues.

the  rapid  expansion  of  oil  palm  in  the  1960s  was 
encouraged by Malaysia’s government, which recognized 
its potential as a complementary crop to rubber.

“the oil palm is the world’s most efficient oil- bearing 
crop in terms of land utilization and productivity. a hectare 
of cultivated oil palm land can supply about 10 and 5 times 
more oil than a soybean or rapeseed hectare, respectively. 
whether  further  improvements  occur  in  the  agronomic 
performance  of  the  palm  or  the  nutritional  property  of 
palm oil, the crop’s future depends on innovation through 
research and development” (May 2012).

the main palm product exported until the 1970s was 
crude palm oil. at that time taxation and incentive policies 
were introduced to encourage the export of refined palm 
products.

Malaysia currently accounts for 39 percent of world 
palm oil production and 44 percent of world exports. on 
average, the country produces 25 tonnes of palm oil a year 

(5–6 percent of the GdP) of which 84 percent is exported 
for more than $18 billion (60 percent of the total export 
earnings).  Currently,  more  than  1.4  million  workers  are 
engaged in the palm oil sector, or 8 percent of the working 
population.

one of the biggest producers and exporters of palm 
oil and palm oil products, Malaysia has an important role 
in fulfilling the growing global need for oils and fats sus-
tainably. with a head start of more than 100 years in the 
oil palm business, Malaysia has a competitive advantage 
and will continue to innovate with continuing support and 
facilitation of agronomic research, technology transfer and 
alliances with other centres of excellence to ensure the 
industry’s sustainable development.

Malaysia  –  geographically  small  with  scarce  arable 
land for new oil palm plantations – continues to increase 
planter  productivity  and  competitiveness  through  a 
nationwide replacement of unproductive palms with high-
yielding hybrids. the exercise includes replanting on lands 
owned  by  independent  smallholders  who  contribute  to 
14 percent of the area under oil palm in Malaysia.

Malaysia’s  example  of  supporting  palm  oil  value 
chains  demonstrates  how  identifying  and  developing 
value chains with high growth and employment potential 
can be an effective policy tool for ensuring inclusive and 
sustainable socioeconomic growth in the long run.

Other issues are that product differentiation on 
variety and quality matters less to non-high-income 
consumers than price. Consequently, the usual inten-
sity of standards (public and private) in GVCs is going 
to be much less pronounced.4 And given that emerg-
ing economies often have a comparative advantage in 
processing themselves, they will probably have a pref-
erence for importing relatively unprocessed products 
and may thus limit upgrading options for low-income 

countries that seemed to open up through the rise of 
GVCs in the past. Two case studies – one for cassava in 
Thailand and one for timber in Gabon – confirm that 
a market shift from the European Union to China has 
led to a decrease in the importance of standards and 
lower value addition in source countries (Kaplinsky 
and Farooki 2010).

Globalization  may  also  cause  global  structural 
change because of re-balancing. China and the United 

111

5“ Technologically successful recipient 

economies built up capabilities to apply, adapt and 
modify foreign technologies, either in partnership 
with foreign firms or by copying from them

States account for huge shares of global imbalances. 
There is widespread agreement that the current imbal-
ances are unsustainable and that United States will 
reduce imports while China will increase consumer 
spending. As the import content and absolute value of 
Chinese consumption is lower than that of US house-
holds, this could affect exports and growth in low- and 
middle-income countries (UNCTAD 2010a; Mayer 
2011).

For all these reasons implementing industrial poli-
cies to encourage firms to join, stay in and move up a 
GVC is not easy (see Chapter 7). The wide dispersion 
of productivity among businesses, the large number of 
unsustainable  micro-enterprises  and  the  stagnation 
of some larger firms suggest that the rapid growth of 
transition economies and East Asian countries in past 
decades will not be repeated in most developing coun-
tries (World Bank 2013a).

So, how do low-income countries take advantage 
of GVCs? Steps include encouraging the highest inte-
gration possible between the business systems of the 
low-income countries and the GVC; promoting tra-
ditional approaches (skill upgrading and vocational 
training, improving the business environment and aid 
for trade interventions for potential entrepreneurs in 
developing countries); and tackling “spoilers” – opera-
tors who are reluctant to change (WEF 2013). These 
operators include companies with high sunk costs or 
that depend on supply-chain barriers (like goods or 
services replaceable by alternative high-tech offerings). 
These constraints and lack of coordination could all 
hold  back  low-  and  middle-income  countries  from 
advancing along GVCs. That would be a huge loss: 
the 30 developing economies that successfully inte-
grated in GVCs and showed the highest participation 
rates grew almost five times faster than the 30 bottom 
countries (UNCTAD 2013b).

Global value chains and technological 
change
The spread of global production networks based on a 
subdivision of the production process has had impor-
tant implications for how technology is transferred 

and applied in importing developing countries. The 
technology  transfer  model  of  the  1960s  and  1970s 
involved either FDI or transfer of foreign technology 
under  licence.  Technologically  successful  recipient 
economies built up capabilities to apply, adapt and 
modify  foreign  technologies,  either  in  partnership 
with foreign firms or by copying from them. National 
support systems helped for R&D investment, training 
and various forms of subsidy, particularly in the most 
successful East Asian cases – the Republic of Korea, 
Singapore and Taiwan Province of China.

The newer form of technology transfer based on 
production  networks  has  been  termed  technology 
“lending”,  with  international  firms  providing  their 
technology to produce parts needed for other elements 
of their global operations. In this interpretation indus-
trialization has been made both “easier and faster” but 
at the same time “less meaningful” (Baldwin forth-
coming). Before the 1980s, export success required a 
deep industrial base – a network of domestic suppli-
ers and technological mastery. In the new era, firms in 
developing countries can link to international produc-
tion networks and draw on the technological and mar-
keting prowess of the lead firms in these chains.

One crucial effect of the new system is that much 
of the technology lent is specific to the lead firm and 
has  tight  intellectual  property  protection  to  pre-
vent  imitation.  So  once  firms  in  developing  coun-
tries are committed to GVCs, they risk finding it far 
harder  than  their  predecessors  in  East  Asia  did  to 
move through the various stages of own equipment 
manufacture. Their precursors worked with the lead 
firm from design, to manufacturing with their own 
designs, to finally breaking into world markets with 
their own brand. Many observers, such as Kaplinsky 
(2005), have commented on the risk that globalization 
is creating a distinction between “headquarter econo-
mies”, where lead firms are based, where technology 
originates and where manufacturing profits are high, 
and “factory economies”, where there is little technical 
innovation and where wages and profits are low.

In economies where this process of product frag-
mentation  has  played  a  major  role,  employment

5“ Trade is likely to have a positive 

impact on skilled labour but a negative 
impact on unskilled workers

growth in export manufacturing is likely to have con-
tributed to rising inequality due to a relative rise in 
the demand for skilled labour (as discussed above). In 
developed economies the offshoring of lower produc-
tivity tasks raises the possibility of higher wages for 
the remaining jobs in manufacturing as the average 
productivity of those workers remaining in employ-
ment increases, again widening wage differentials with 
the rest of the economy.

Trade, particularly through the import of goods 
that embody new skill-intensive technologies, appears 
to have played an important role in increasing income 
inequality by raising the relative wage of skilled work-
ers and increasing the premium attached to further 
education. Importantly, however, the relation between 
trade and inequality holds for trade between middle-
income  technology-importing  countries  and  high-
income  countries,  but  not  for  trade  between  low-
income countries and high-income countries nor for 
trade between low-income countries as a group.

Impact of trade in manufactures on 
employment quality
As seen at the start of this chapter, trade of manufac-
tured goods may drive technological change and pro-
ductivity. Economic theory postulates that productiv-
ity drives wages. So trade can improve employment 

quality through the productivity effect. Endogenous 
growth  models  providing  theoretical  foundations 
have  largely  focused  on  two  types  of  technologi-
cal  change:  R&D  and  learning-by-doing  spillover 
effects (Grossman and Helpman 1991; Romer 1990; 
Box 5.2).

The literature has empirical evidence supporting 
the argument that trade improves skills and produc-
tivity  through  knowledge  diffusion.  Brazil  started 
to  liberalize  trade  in  the  1990s,  and  exports  and 
imports grew after 2000. Over the same period rela-
tive demand for skilled labour increased substantially. 
Technological transfer from richer countries upgraded 
the skills of Brazilian manufacturing firms (Araújo, 
Bogliacino and Vivarelli 2009).

Trade is likely to have a positive impact on skilled 
labour but a negative impact on unskilled workers. 
Evidence from six manufacturing sectors in Tunisia 
shows that unskilled workers are vulnerable to trade as 
they face increasing competition in the output market. 
Skilled labour is better positioned because the increase 
in  market  opportunities  in  skill-intensive  markets 
derived  from  additional  trade  openness  outweighs 
substitution possibilities for this category of worker 
(Mouheli and Ghazali 2012).

Rodrik (1997) identifies three main impacts of lib-
eralization on the international labour market. First, 

Box 5.2 
Research and development and learning-by-doing spillover effects from trade

Coe and helpman (1995) provide a theoretical and empiri-
cal  background  on  the  relationship  between  trade  and 
spillovers. they estimate that foreign research and devel-
opment has beneficial effects on domestic productivity, 
and that these are stronger the more open an economy is 
to foreign trade. developing countries will be able to enjoy 
technology spillovers based on their capability to absorb 
technological change. short geographical distance, short 
technological distance (expressed as a similar distribution 
of  patenting  among  different  technologies)  and  linguis-
tic and trade-bloc relations all encourage technological 
transfer.  the  flow  of  knowledge  is  more  likely  to  occur 
between leader innovators (verdolini and Galeotti 2011).

the notion of learning by doing derives from the con-
cept of the “learning curve”, which reflects the observation 

that  with  greater  “experience”  (cumulative  production) 
there  is  a  decline  in  the  unit  costs  of  new  technologies 
(arrow 1962). trade also stimulates learning by doing, and 
most of the technical and managerial innovations made 
in high-income countries may be adopted by low-income 
countries (young 1991). the positive externalities of cost 
discovery are also important, especially for entrepreneurs. 
If a project is successful, other entrepreneurs learn that 
they can make the product. In this way benefits to the first 
mover spread to the overall industry (hausmann, hwang 
and rodrik 2006). this imitation process may help low-
income countries transition to higher value-added sectors 
and increase their demand for skilled labour.

5“ As with trade, FDI does not automatically 

generate growth and beneficial structural change

workers  in  the  North  have  to  accept  lower  labour 
standards and benefits, given poorer wages and con-
ditions in competing countries (the race to the bot-
tom). Second, greater openness leads to a more volatile 
labour market, which widens wage inequalities within 
groups and increases insecurity among workers. Third, 
given that workers are substitutable, the bargaining 
power of trade unions declines.

The  effect  of  the  race  to  the  bottom  is  seen  in 
the Global Wage Report 2010–2011 (ILO 2011b). It 
shows a decrease of the manufacturing wage share over 
1990–2007 – that is, before the global financial crisis, 
as wages rose less quickly than manufacturing value 
added (profits rose more quickly; Figure 5.7).

The  race  to  the  bottom  would  be  unlikely  ever 
to lead to positive structural change, except in those 
countries where low-productivity, low-wage jobs repre-
sent the only alternative to unemployment. But some 
low-income  countries  could  take  advantage  of  the 
race. In recent decades Asian countries have increased 
their share of world merchandise exports to more than 

30 percent, attracting employment by offering a more 
competitive  business  environment  such  as  through 
lower wages, while other countries (including those in 
South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa) were unable to 
raise their merchandise export share, which remained 
below 5 percent (Figure 5.8). However, China’s ris-
ing wages could help Sub-Saharan Africa increase its 
manufacturing  jobs.  Lin  (2011)  argues  that  China 
will free up 85 million labour-intensive manufactur-
ing  jobs,  compared  with  Japan’s  9.7  million  in  the 
1960s and the Republic of Korea’s 2.3 million in the 
1980s,  due  to  wage  increases  in  the  coming  years. 
Africa, the continent with the lowest GDP per capita, 
has only around 10 million manufacturing jobs and 
could thus gain from changes in China’s wages and 
competitiveness.

structure of an economy generally and manufacturing 
particularly in various ways. Evidence shows that FDI 
is often strongly related to export gains, and supports 
a positive correlation between the stock of FDI in the 
tradable sector and the export–GDP ratio (Kinoshita 
2011). Countries with a high FDI stock–GDP ratio 
are also those with the highest foreign value added in 
exports, GVC participation rate and contribution of 
value-added trade to GDP (UNCTAD 2013b).

These correlations translate into structural change 
if exports stimulated by FDI change the production 
composition and the technological intensity of pro-
duction. The impact of economic diversification on 
long-run productivity crucially depends on the tech-
nology segment or the GVC stage receiving the invest-
ments (or both). Countries receiving FDI in high- and 
medium-tech sectors are more likely to boost produc-
tivity  in  the  long  run  (for  some  Eastern  European 
countries,  see  Damijan,  Kostevc  and  Rojec  2013). 
Domestically  oriented  FDI  may  also  help  enhance 
structural change as it may fill expectations of demand 
increase, as in Viet Nam in the 1990s when domestic 
firms did not have the capacity to produce efficiently 

in  the  FDI-targeted  sectors  (Schaumburg-Müller 
2002).

FDI  may  also  affect  structural  change  through 

other mechanisms:
•  By strengthening competition and weakening oli-
gopoly/monopoly elements. Increasing competition 
may stimulate structural change through a direct 
or indirect effect: directly, market restructuring 
makes  firms  more  efficient  since  more  efficient 
firms have more revenues to spend to upgrade busi-
ness  activities;  indirectly,  a  competitive  market 
helps to create a favourable business environment 
(Moose 2002).

•  By diffusing knowledge of new production processes. 
Local  firms  may  benefit  through  learning  by 
watching, labour mobility, backward and forward 
linkages and relocation of R&D activities (Zhao 
and  Zhang  2006).  Additionally,  FDI  may  be  a 
means to transfer managerial know-how from for-
eign to local firms; vertical spillovers in the supply 
chain are more effective than horizontal spillovers; 
and managerial spillovers may spread intention-
ally (through demonstrations) or unintentionally 
(through relationships with business partners; Fu 
2009).

•  By  stimulating  the  entry  of  firms  in  other  sec-
tors  (horizontal  linkages).  They  create  business 
opportunities  for  local  entrepreneurs  (by  creat-
ing  demand  for  local  products  and  services)  or 
upstream/downstream activities (vertical linkages; 
Ayyagari and Kosová 2006).

•  By creating the right conditions to enhance struc-
tural change. FDI may improve conditions in the 
financial market. With a direct channel, FDI helps 
correct  capital-market  failure;  with  an  indirect 
channel, FDI may help strengthen stock market 
indicators (Soumaré and Tchana 2011).
Much evidence supports the positive relationship 
between FDI, growth and employment. IFC (2013) 
finds that over the last decade the rate of growth of 
FDI-related employment (28 percent) has outpaced 
growth of the global labour force (16 percent), indi-
cating a growing importance of FDI in job creation.

“ FDI is not a “silver bullet”. While it is often 

linked to growth of capital and technology, 
spillovers to local economic development do 
not always spread to the whole economy

The World Investment Report 2013 finds a strong and 
positive relationship between FDI and GDP growth 
(UNCTAD 2013b).

Despite this evidence FDI is not a “silver bullet”. 
While it is often linked to growth of capital and tech-
nology, spillovers to local economic development do 
not always spread to the whole economy. For example, 
countries with rich natural resources but low quality 
of governance rarely show structural change (te Velde 
2006), a point underlined in Table 5.6: Africa and 
least developed countries with the lowest GDP per 
capita have the biggest share of FDI in the primary 
sector (UNCTAD 2013b) – where backward and for-
ward linkages are typically very weak.

Honing in on a single country, in Costa Rica over 
1997–2005 foreign investment in offshoring activities 
contributed to the expansion of skilled, productive 
and well-paying jobs, reflecting business by Intel and 
other high-tech companies. But offshoring activities 
did not integrate well with the overall economy, par-
ticularly manufacturing – and such integration is key 
to maximizing FDI’s beneficial impact on growth and 
employment (Ernst and Sánchez-Ancochea 2008).

Large,  newly  established  and  highly  productive 
domestic firms seem more likely to benefit from FDI 
(Amendolagine  et  al.  2013).  This  means  that  FDI 
often  provides  most  benefits  to  highly  productive 
firms rather than to those needing to upgrade through 
technology,  thus  increasing  inequality  and  offering 
little impact on structural change. So, for technology

transfer to trickle down to domestic firms through 
FDI, governments need to promote local firms that 
can initially adopt and adapt technology from FDI, 
and support the development of domestic production 
linkages and networks, in which initial adopters play 
a conduit role in disseminating the foreign technology 
vertically and horizontally to related firms.

Notes
1. 

In this chapter we use trade liberalization, trade 
openness and export orientation almost as syno-
nyms. Some analysts question whether East Asian 
countries  really  liberalized  and  increased  trade 
openness  as  they  adopted  trade  protectionist 
measures, and for this reason they prefer to call 
them export oriented. Trade openness is a broader 
concept than trade liberalization as it incorpo-
rates liberalization of FDI, remittances and the 
wider  financial  market.  As  the  most  common 
measure of trade openness (ratio of exports plus 
imports  to  GDP)  and  the  scientific  and  policy 
debate do not always capture these nuances, we 
prefer  to  acknowledge  this  distinction  but  use 
these terms interchangeably.

the report we call this index “structural change”, 
even though it represents the orientation of the 
manufacturing  production  towards  high-tech 
sectors (stock variable) rather than properly struc-
tural change (flow variable). The two variables are

5Chapter 6
Structural change and 
manufacturing employment in a 
resource-constrained world

Sustainable development rests on economic develop-
ment, social advancement and environmental protec-
tion. The concept has been ensconced in policy for 
decades, but translating it into action remains a chal-
lenge, which for industry means producing goods and 
services that do not harm the natural environment 
but that improve living standards. The paradigm of 
continually increasing demand for finite resources to 
support economic growth, alongside worsening envi-
ronmental degradation, must be shifted in the coming 
years.

The  rate  of  this  demand  increase  may  well  be 
set to rise too, with the rapid expansion of emerg-
ing markets and an estimated additional 3 billion 
middle-class consumers in the next 20 years (Kharas 
2010).  In  recent  years  global  material  consump-
tion has grown at around 3 percent a year, and so 
by 2050 could reach 140 billion tonnes of minerals, 
ores, fossil fuels and biomass a year, or about three 
times current levels (UNEP 2011a). In addition, this 
soaring demand takes place at a time when accessing 
and processing most of those resources has become 
more challenging and expensive (Dobbs et al. 2011). 
Wasteful production and consumption patterns – 
along with continuing soil degradation, deforesta-
tion and overfishing – will result in increasing water 
shortages and escalating prices for food, energy and 
other  commodities  (ILO  2012).  And  along  with 
climate change, they are increasingly constraining 
production. Environmental change is likely to accel-
erate in the coming decades, no doubt affecting the 
underprivileged the most, as they depend the most 
on environmental capital and have the least means 
to adapt.

Resource  efficiency  thus  has  not  been  a  major 
driver of structural change in the past – but must be so 
in the future. The paradigm of resource-intensive and 
highly polluting economic development is being ques-
tioned. Some scholars argue that green-sensitive ideas 
may well cause a slowdown in the rate of structural 

change and thus on employment. In this vein Dercon 
(2012)  posits  that  environmental  constraints  may 
change the patterns of structural change with employ-
ment and distributional effects that will not lead to 
sustained economic growth. The argument holds from 
the perspective of internalization of environmental 
externalities.

But  efforts  to  promote  resource  efficiency  find 
themselves at the intersection of economic, employ-
ment and environmental policies. “Decoupling” nat-
ural  resource  use  and  environmental  impacts  from 
economic  activity  is  a  concrete  means  to  reconcile 
the policy imperatives of economic growth, and thus 
employment and environmental protection. Indeed, 
increased resource productivity lifts competitiveness, 
especially  as  resources  often  represent  a  significant 
share  of  production  costs,  especially  in  developing 
countries. It also supports employment, and undoubt-
edly alleviates the burden on the environment.1

Green  structural  change  –  a  move  to  green 
industry – will involve shifting to industries more 
technologically  advanced  and  with  higher  labour 
and capital productivity, while improving resource 
productivity as a means of both boosting competi-
tiveness and protecting the environment. Past abun-
dance  of  relatively  inexpensive  natural  resources, 
such  as  energy,  water  and  materials,  is  coming  to 
an end, and industries will need to restructure with 
demand for environmentally damaging goods fall-
ing and for environmentally preferable goods rising. 
Green structural change will be influenced by factors 
related  to  resource  constraints  and  environmental 
protection, as well as other cost and environmental 
considerations. As manufacturing industries tend to 
be resource intensive, cost considerations will focus 
on increasing resource productivity. Environmental 
considerations will arise from consumers looking for 
environmentally friendly products or from govern-
ments aiming to reduce the environmental footprint 
of human activity.

“ Reconciling the legitimate aspirations for a 

better life with environmental protection requires 
a paradigm shift that decouples economic activity 
from resource use and environmental impact

Reconciling the legitimate aspirations for a bet-
ter  life  with  environmental  protection  requires 
a  paradigm  shift  that  decouples  economic  activ-
ity  from  resource  use  and  environmental  impact. 
Opportunities  for  decoupling  will  arise  for  enter-
prises as they adapt to new prices and scarcities and 
as they get involved in new businesses that commer-
cialize green goods and services, such as equipment for 
recycling or renewable energy, or specialized consult-
ing services. Bettering resource efficiency will be the 
driver of green structural change underpinned by the 
uptake of new green technologies and a growing trade 
in environmental goods.

And green jobs will be created, arising from invest-
ments  in  the  areas  of  renewable  energy,  industrial 
energy efficiency, waste management and recycling, 
environmental  services  and,  most  important,  new 
green technologies and products as countries move up 
the productivity and technological ladder.

Industrial greening: an 
emerging driver
UNIDO  refers  to  “green  industry”  as  a  pattern  of 
industrial production and development that does not 
come at the expense of the health of natural systems 
and does not lead to adverse human health outcomes. 
It consists of an industrial system that does not require 
an ever-growing use of natural resources and pollution 
to fuel societal progress (Box 6.1).

Box 6.1 
Green economy and green industry

Such a change is needed. In the recent past the 
abundance of relatively inexpensive natural resources, 
such as energy, water and materials, spurred economic 
development. The material throughput of the global 
economy and environmental pollution has followed 
similar trends (Figure 6.1). But there are strong indica-
tions that this era is coming to an end, given increas-
ing competition for resources. Also, from an environ-
mental perspective, “planetary boundaries” are being 
overstepped (Rockström et al. 2009).

a green economy results in “improved human well-being 
and social equity, while significantly reducing environ-
mental  risks  and  ecological  scarcities”  (uneP  2010). 
Closely related, “green industry” is a concept to address 
global,  interrelated  challenges  through  a  set  of  imme-
diately  actionable  cross-cutting  strategies  that  take 
advantage of market forces and emerging industries. It 
contributes  to  a  model  of  development  that  considers 
resource constraints and the earth’s carrying-capacity 
limits.

developing and transition countries have huge poten-
tial for pursuing green industry further – they are already 

making heavy public and private investments to improve 
resource productivity and reduce environmental impact 
(in one of the worst manifestations, pollution) and secur-
ing the associated benefits of improved competiveness, 
employment and environmental conservation.

Green  structural  change  reflects  the  growing  impor-
tance  of  shifting  towards  sectors  –  and  within  them, 
activities  – that efficiently use not only capital and labour 
but  also  natural  resources  to  minimize  environmental 
impact.

This  shift  towards  higher  productivity  and 
greener industries will entail economic restructur-
ing. An overall increase in resource productivity and 
a decline in manufacturing’s intensity of pollution 
– other things being equal – would be key charac-
teristics  of  green  structural  change.  But  for  now 
material  use  and  socioeconomic  development  are 
intertwined, to some degree at least: countries with 
the highest per capita manufacturing value added 
are  those  with  the  highest  domestic  material  use 
(Figure 6.2). Still, material consumption has been 
increasing globally over the past few decades more 
slowly than GDP in all major regions of the world 
– that is, productivity of material use is increasing 
(Dittrich et al. 2012).

Increased  demand  and  investment  in  greener 
products and services, as well as the equipment and 
infrastructure  to  produce  them,  will  expand  cer-
tain  industries  and  enterprises  (ILO  2012).  This 
will  translate  into  higher  labour  demand  and  job 
creation (direct effect), mainly in green sectors (see 
Green manufacturing jobs below). In addition, due to 
inter-industry relations of the expanding industries,

other parts of the economy that supply inputs to the 
expanding  green  sectors  will  also  benefit,  creating 
additional  employment  (indirect  effect),  including 
employment in non-green sectors such as cement for 
green buildings or steel and carbon fibre for the blades 
and towers of wind turbines. The income generated 
by this additional economic activity is redistributed 
by spending on additional consumption and invest-
ment across the economy, creating further employ-
ment (induced effects), in addition to the direct and 
indirect jobs.

Factors at play
The empirical evidence is becoming more persuasive 
that resource scarcity and environmental factors are 
constraining industrial production, leading to adjust-
ments at the enterprise and sector levels to deal with 
resource-related  risks  and  opportunities  (Dobbs  et 
al. 2011). Job opportunities, especially those of the 
underprivileged, may decline if economic growth is 
constrained by physical or economic shortages (EU 
2012).

The response – green structural change – is thus 
influenced by factors related to resource constraints 
and  environmental  protection,  as  well  as  to  other 
external factors, classified as cost and environmental.
Cost  considerations  may  well  trigger  a  shift 
from  resource-  and  pollution-intensive  sectors, 
but  independently  from  considerations  related 
to  resource  conservation  and  environmental  pro-
tection.  As  manufacturing  industries  tend  to  be 
resource intensive, greater resource productivity is 
a key factor in competitiveness in its own right. For 
their part, environmental concerns will stimulate 
increased resource productivity in industrial activi-
ties and reduce their environmental impact. They 
can trigger a self-induced structural shift towards 
greener  manufacturing,  to  respond  to  increasing 
customer demand for resource-efficient products, 
for example. Or they can be prompted by targeted 
policy and regulatory interventions, such as phasing 
out subsidies for fossil fuels or banning incandes-
cent light bulbs.

6“ For sustainable industrial development, 

industrial structure has to change towards 
a direction that decouples economic activity 
from resource use and environmental impact

Straddling the two sides are cases when the envi-
ronmental burden has an internalized cost. Decreasing 
the cost of managing waste is best achieved by avoid-
ing waste in the first place. Also, non-compliance with 
environmental  regulations  –  when  enforced  –  can 
have financial and operational consequences, includ-
ing sanctions.

Adapting manufacturing capacity to this evolving 
context translates into two elements: reorienting exist-
ing  industries  towards  greener  resources,  processes, 
practices and products; and creating green industries 
(UNIDO 2011c).

The  first  element  entails  improving  production 
efficiency,  by  using  resources  more  efficiently  and 
optimizing the productive use of natural resources; 
minimizing  environmental  impact  by  reducing  the 
generation  of  waste  and  emissions  and  promoting 
the environmentally sound management of residual 
wastes;  and  minimizing  health  risks  by  managing 
chemicals safely.

The  second  reflects  environmental  technologies 
and services originating from the transition to a green 
economy, including companies that develop, manu-
facture and install clean technologies for industrial, 
transport,  buildings  and  automotive  sectors.  They 
also  cover  service  industries,  including  material-
recovery companies, recycling companies and waste- 
management, -treatment and -transport companies. 
Other examples are engineering companies special-
izing in wastewater treatment, air pollution control 
and the manufacture of waste treatment equipment, 
as well as companies providing monitoring, measure-
ment and analytical services.

Decoupling
For  sustainable  industrial  development,  industrial 
structure has to change towards a direction that decou-
ples economic activity from resource use and environ-
mental impact (Figure 6.3).

Decoupling  may  be  viewed  as  relative,  where 
production rises but the increase in resource use and 
environmental impact does not rise as quickly – and 
as  absolute,  where  production  can  increase  while

resource use and environmental impact fall. The world 
economy has already achieved a relative decoupling, 
extracting around 40 percent more economic value 
from each tonne of raw material than three decades 
ago.  Still,  these  gains  have  been  swamped  by  eco-
nomic growth of 150 percent over the same period 
(Hinterberger et al. 2013).

Even though an abundant literature stresses that 
environmental protection bears a cost, a parallel lit-
erature  has  emerged  showing  that  green  measures 
can provide economic and social benefits, including 
von Weizsäcker et al. (2009), who argue that gains 
in resource productivity in several economic sectors 
can lead to an 80 percent reduction of environmen-
tal  impacts  per  unit  of  economic  output.  Similarly 
Dobbs et al. (2011) observe that up to 30 percent of 
the  resource  demand  in  2030  could  be  addressed 
by  resource-productivity  opportunities  –  and  thus 
avoided in absolute terms.

Since  the  1990s  an  academic  discussion  has 
emerged around the hypothesis of the “Environmental 
Kuznets Curve” (EKC).2 In this, the environmental 
impact first increases until reaching a given level of

conditions can be reconciled with the 
finite nature of natural resources and 
the need to protect the environment

economic activity, before gradually decreasing by itself 
as economies mature (Azar, Holmberg and Karlsson 
2002). The hypothesis is based on four assumptions 
(Stamm et al. 2009).

First, there is a tendency for the values to shift 
from  welfare  based  on  quantitative  satisfaction 
towards higher preferences for environmental qual-
ity.  Better  educated  and  informed  agents  tend  to 
be more likely to take the environmental externali-
ties into account before consuming, thus providing 
an incentive for manufacturers to adapt production 
patterns accordingly (Inglehart 1977). Second, as an 
economy develops, the composition of value addition 
changes, changing the pattern of resource use and 
environmental impact (Pasinetti 1983). Third, insti-
tutions in higher income countries are more inclined 
to internalize environmental externalities and pro-
vide adequate incentives. Fourth, more advanced and 
sophisticated businesses tend to apply technological 
innovations in production. Whether introduced to 
spur  productivity  or  based  on  environmental  con-
cerns,  these  innovations  often  raise  resource  pro-
ductivity and lower the intensity of environmental 
impact.

A vast body of work has tested this EKC hypoth-
esis. Some studies have corroborated the existence of 
an EKC-like relationship with local pollutants, such 
as sulphur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide (Stern 2004), 
though  the  empirical  evidence  demonstrating  the 
prevalence of EKC for other environmental indicators 
and at a broader scale is “scant, fleeting and fragile” 
(Carson 2010).

But even assuming that an EKC exists, passively 
waiting  for  the  hypothetical  turning  point  is  no 
option, as it could coincide with a global level of pol-
lution beyond the abortive capacity of the biosphere 
(Stamm et al. 2009). Also, the link between income 
and environmental impact at country level is blurred, 
due to the huge increase in international trade. Indeed, 
consumption might be delinked from production in a 
given country (Panayotou 2000).

The key thus lies in decoupling natural resource 
use  and  environmental  impacts  from  economic 

activity. In such a way, aspirations for better socioec-
onomic conditions can be reconciled with the finite 
nature of natural resources and the need to protect 
the environment. This huge shift will require drastic 
structural changes, affecting employment positively 
(through opportunities for green jobs) as well as less 
benignly.

The  opportunities  will  stem  from  two  areas  of 
adjustment.  First,  existing  enterprises  will  need  to 
adapt to the new circumstances, whether caused by 
more expensive raw materials or by policy incentives 
and disincentives, and so will require new skill sets 
and experience. Second, greener manufacturing will 
create  a  range  of  opportunities  for  businesses  that 
commercialize green goods and services such as equip-
ment for recycling or renewable energy, or specialized 
consulting services.

Some subsectors will undoubtedly see job losses, 
though the number should be manageable and small 
relative  to  shifts  produced  by  other  factors  such  as 
globalization or movement between enterprises (ILO 
2012).  Firms  in  more  resource-  or  energy-intensive 
activities will no doubt lose competitiveness as well, 
but this is all the more reason for them to be look-
ing forward. The same argument holds at the macro-
economic  level.  Countries  improving  competitive-
ness  through  measures  to  achieve  greater  resource 
efficiency will be well positioned in a resource-con-
strained  global  economy:  Figure  6.4  suggests  that 
countries with lower energy intensive industry tend to 
add more value – and vice versa.

Countries that focus on moving towards cleaner 
and more sustainable industries have numerous field-
proven instruments. At their core, strategy-planning, 
goal-setting and benchmarking have proved useful in 
identifying potential improvements. Benchmarking, 
which  can  raise  awareness  of  resource  productivity 
(or its lack), provides a tangible way to determine the 
resource or energy efficiency of a system, whether a 
process, company or nation. It compares actual energy 
and resource use against best available practice.

Despite  the  seemingly  clear  case  for  resource 
efficiency  – environmentally or economically – major

barriers remain to pushing through concrete measures. 
Central  is  access  to  financing.  Many  enterprises  in 
developing countries, particularly small and medium-
size ones, struggle to finance gains in resource produc-
tivity and environmental performance. These invest-
ments are crucial to any government strategy aimed at 
promoting industrial development, especially as small 
and medium-size enterprises often form the backbone 
of developing economies.

Resource efficiency as a driver of 
manufacturing structural change
Resource  efficiency  is  the  ratio  between  resources 
required  and  desired  output.  So  resource  produc-
tivity  can  be  defined  as  the  efficiency  with  which 
energy or materials are used to produce a given out-
put. Increasing resource efficiency is appealing from a 
number of viewpoints: economic, given that resources 
often loom large in many developing countries’ manu-
facturing output costs; and environmental, as fewer 
inputs should mean less pollution and less contamina-
tion from wastage.

One  school  of  thought  draws  attention  to  the 
potential negative impacts of restrictions on resource 
use and pollution on firms’ competitiveness, arguably 
jeopardizing jobs. Morgenstern, Pizer and Shih (2002) 
analysed job dynamics in four heavily polluting indus-
tries in the United States (pulp and paper mills, plas-
tic manufacturers, petroleum refiners, and iron and 
steel mills) and found that increased environmental 
spending generally did not cause a significant drop 
in employment. If anything, the change tended to be 
positive.

There is ample empirical evidence demonstrat-
ing the positive influence of more efficient resource 
use on economic performance. For a sample of ISO 
14001 certified companies in South-East Asia, Rao 
and Holt (2005) modelled the link between green 
supply-chain management practices and increased 
competitiveness  on  the  one  hand  and  improved 
economic  performance  on  the  other.  They  found 
a  positive  correlation  between  those  dimensions. 
Similarly, Ilinitch and Schaltegger (1995) demon-
strated  that  positive  environmental  performance

6“ Steep gains in resource efficiency 

require dedicated actions

could  be  associated  with  neutral  or  positive  eco-
nomic performance, in contrast to the often asserted 
negative effects.

Steep gains in resource efficiency require dedicated 
actions. Indeed, even in world regions characterized 
by limited economic growth and advanced innova-
tion  systems,  signs  of  effective  decoupling  are  fee-
ble, perhaps due to the “rebound effect” (Sorrell and 
Dimitropoulos 2008). This refers to the behavioural 
or other systemic responses to the introduction of new 
technologies that increase the efficiency of resource 
use,  thus  potentially  offsetting  the  benefits  of  the 
measures taken.

What some argue for is thus a qualitative leap in 
resource productivity, particularly in economies with 
high growth and weaker innovation. Huber (2000) 
looks to transformational, as opposed to incremen-
tal,  changes  in  industrial  structures,  which  would 
require  a  shift  from  the  predominant  policy  focus 
on improvement of labour and capital productivity 
towards resource productivity (see also Hinterberger 
et al. 2013).

By  the  mid-1990s  thought  leaders  had  already 
developed  such  a  vision  of  drastic  change.  The 
“Factor 4” strategy outlined a world with double the 
wealth using half the natural resources in the coming 
decades (von Weizsäcker, Lovins and Lovins 1997). 
Based on this, and examining innovation in indus-
try, the subsequent Factor Five described how to roll 
out measures leading to 80 percent improvements in 
resource and energy productivity, with a massive boost 
in wealth for billions of people (von Weizsäcker et al. 
2009).

Uptake of green technology
Technology  will  be  essential  in  decoupling  eco-
nomic growth from the burdens on the environment. 
Ocampo  (2011)  stresses  that  the  green  transition 
entails a technological revolution, with fundamental 
impacts on production structures and consumption 
patterns. Yet technological change rarely takes place in 
a vacuum, and often requires incentives. Success stories 
of widespread penetration of new energy technologies 

are the product of forward-thinking, ambitious gov-
ernment policies.

Bursts of innovation are associated with cyclical 
economic  development  (Freeman  and  Perez  1988). 
From this perspective, Rifkin (2011) argues that we 
are entering an area of innovations related to sustain-
ability, paving the way towards the “next great eco-
nomic era” (Figure 6.5).

A  logarithmic  mean  Divisia  index  technique  is 
applied to investigate the green technological uptake 
using carbon dioxide emissions reduction as a proxy 
of environmental impact. Using the I = PAT model, 
where  the  human  impact  on  the  environment  is 
assumed to be a function of the population, economic 
activity (affluence) and technology, it is possible to cal-
culate to what extent the variation of manufacturing 
carbon dioxide emissions depends on the variation of 
emission intensity, energy productivity, value added 
per capita and population:
MVAi,t
Popi,t

Eneri,t

Ei,t Popi,t

=

*

*

,

where  E  represents  manufacturing  carbon  dioxide 
emissions, MVA is manufacturing value added, Pop is 
total population and Ener is manufacturing energy. 

The calculation was applied to 45 countries with 
data  on  all  these  variables  over  2001–2010,  and 
Figure 6.6 shows the outcome of the decomposition 
of manufacturing carbon dioxide emissions. Global 
manufacturing carbon dioxide emissions rose 40 per-
cent. The decomposition indicates that at the global 
level all components – population, value added per 
capita,  energy  intensity  and  emissions  intensity 
–  contributed  positively  to  that  increase.  By  con-
trast, considering high-income countries separately, 
where manufacturing emissions fell 11 percent, all 
determinants contributed to the decrease with the 
notable exception of population, which is inversely 
correlated.

In Brazil, the Russian Federation, India, China 
and  South  Africa  (BRICS)  where  manufacturing 
emissions  rose  109  percent,  the  emission  intensity 
rose  only  slightly  while  energy  intensity  declined  a

little.  Interestingly,  the  increase  in  manufacturing 
value added per capita explains most of the increase in 
emissions, reflecting the shift in materials production 

to  developing  countries,  particularly  to  the  BRICS 
(Banerjee et al. 2012). As far as low-income countries 
are  concerned,  where  carbon  dioxide  manufactur-
ing  emissions  climbed  16  percent,  the  decomposi-
tion  indicates  that  much  of  that  increase  is  due  to 
increased manufacturing activity and a rising popula-
tion. The emission intensity of manufacturing energy 
fell sharply, a trend that can be interpreted as a sign 
of gains in manufacturing processes and greater use of 
green technology.

Low-income countries account for a small share 
of global emissions, though the likely growth of their 
economic  activity  will  no  doubt  add  to  emissions, 
offset  to  a  degree  (on  the  current  pattern)  by  the 
uptake of green technology. Applying the “best avail-
able technologies” as industries develop represents a 
unique opportunity for low-income countries. Large 
investments,  particularly  in  heavy  machinery,  have 
an impact over several decades, as switches of existing 
plant are few and refurbishing costly. So cleaner tech-
nologies offer promising prospects to boost industry’s 
competitiveness in these countries.

For  green  structure  change,  knowledge  and 
innovation – including technologies – represent key

“ Governments in all countries will need to 

carry out policies to continue strengthening 
green technological change by encouraging 
profitable opportunities as industries go green

assets. Schumpeter identified innovation as the criti-
cal dimension of economic change (Pol and Carroll 
2006). Recent changes in intellectual property rights 
are due to the increase of cross-border exchanges in 
terms  of  goods  and  services,  but  also  to  structural 
changes in economies, with knowledge becoming an 
important tradable asset (Curtis 2012).

With intellectual property rights associated with 
private sector investment, strengthening such regimes 
would imply greater opportunities for firms to com-
pound their position (Lesser 1998). But some studies 
indicate that developing countries with low human 
capital might not benefit from strengthening intel-
lectual property rights (Bravo-Ortega and Lederman 
2010).  Indeed,  such  action  could  have  a  negative 
effect  on  domestic  innovation,  particularly  where 
it is mostly based on imitation or adaptive in nature 
(Schneider 2005).

In  the  next  few  decades  governments  in  all 
countries will need to carry out policies to continue 
strengthening green technological change by encour-
aging profitable opportunities as industries go green 
(UNIDO 2011b).

Trade and green structural change
All major world regions already export environmental 
goods (Figure 6.7), demonstrating the ready market 
for such products. As an illustration, about 9 percent 
of the retail price of high-efficiency refrigerators in 
Spain can be considered a price premium, representing 
a third of the cost of saved energy over the appliance’s 
life  (Galarraga,  Heres  and  Gonzalez-Eguino  2011). 
An expanded environmental market could generate 
international spillovers by reducing production costs 
for low-income countries exporting to high-income 
economies (Cantore 2009).

Under  the  global  regime  for  mitigating  climate 
change, industrialized countries are bound to targets 
for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, theoretically 
enabling developing countries to grow in two ways 
(Gerlagh and Kuik 2007): a reduction of fossil fuel 
demand in high-income countries cuts the global price 
of energy, raising demand for energy and thus growth 
in developing countries; or environmental policies in 
high-income countries encourage industries to relo-
cate  to  developing  countries,  where  constraints  are 
looser.

6“ Structural change towards a service-

focused society, as in industrialized 
countries, does not necessarily imply a 
global reduction of resource use

Reduced  emissions  in  high-income  countries 
would thus be partly offset by increased emissions in 
developing countries, a variant of “carbon leakage”. 
This  occurs  when  one  country  increases  its  carbon 
dioxide  emissions  because  a  second  country  with  a 
strict climate policy has reduced its emissions, though 
the literature shows little evidence of the size of the 
long-term leakage effects.

The prospect of carbon leakage gave rise to pro-
posals  for  border  taxes  based  on  the  embodied 
carbon  content  of  goods  imported  from  develop-
ing countries. But such schemes are rarely effective 
and are hard to set up. Some scholars find that the 
border tax adjustments have little impact on reduc-
ing carbon leakage and protecting economic com-
petitiveness (Antimiani et al. 2011; McKibbin and 
Wilcoxen 2009). Cosbey (2008) further raises issues 
of compliance with international trade agreements, 
as well as other legal and institutional issues. Also, 
border tax does not hold the comparison with con-
sumption taxation, which, besides being simpler to 
implement,  implies  a  more  efficient  allocation  of 
resources across the life cycle and thus an arguably 
more equitable proposition from the perspective of 
developing countries.

Structural  change  towards  a  service-focused 
society, as in industrialized countries, does not nec-
essarily  imply  a  global  reduction  of  resource  use, 
because resource- and pollution-intensive industries 
in  developing  countries  are  producing  goods  for 
wealthier  countries  (Stamm  et  al.  2009).  For  this 
reason data based on domestic production provide 
a highly skewed picture as they disregard embod-
ied resources and emissions in imported goods and 
services, especially in a world where manufacturing 
production is shifting to industrializing and devel-
oping countries.

Consumption-based accounting helps reorient the 
picture: covering international trade and transport, it 
encapsulates all emissions related to global consump-
tion  (Peters  2008).  Consumption-based  invento-
ries draw on total global emissions for the economic 
consumption of a country, rather than the economic 

activity of the producing country. This has obvious 
implications for the political economy of environmen-
tal protection, as current regimes in the realm of cli-
mate change are based on production-based environ-
mental impact.

Green manufacturing jobs

An approach rather than a definition
Green jobs have no single and universally accepted 
definition,  although  typical  characteristics  are  that 
they reduce consumption of energy and raw materials; 
limit greenhouse gas emissions; minimize waste and 
pollution; protect and restore ecosystems; and ena-
ble enterprises and communities to adapt to climate 
change (ILO 2013).

The  quality  of  employment  often  features,  and 
the literature frequently incorporates, social consid-
erations such as “decent work” (Renner, Sweeney and 
Kubit 2008, for example). Such considerations involve 
opportunities for work that is productive and deliv-
ers a fair income, security in the workplace and social 
protection for families, better prospects for personal 
development and social integration, freedom for peo-
ple to express their concerns and organize and partici-
pate in the decisions that affect their lives, and equal-
ity of opportunity and treatment for all women and 
men (ILO 2013).

Some commentators distinguish between green 
jobs and environment-related employment. Varma 
(2010) argues that to be called green, environment-
related  jobs  must  meet  acceptable  standards  on 
wages, gender and working conditions, and suggests 
that green jobs account for only about a quarter of 
all environment-related jobs.3 But as Pollin (2009) 
has  noted,  an  absence  of  a  clear-cut  definition 
should not stand in the way of actions to promote 
green jobs.

Estimates of current jobs
As industries that provide environmental goods and 
services continue to expand – reflecting a combination 
of growing green demand, increasingly stringent laws

services, the smart application of information 
and communications technologies, repair and 
maintenance, and substitute and recycled 
materials will be in greater demand

and agreements and a growing focus on resource effi-
ciency, productivity and competitiveness – so too does 
demand for cleaner technologies, less risk to the envi-
ronment and better resource management (including 
recycling and resource recovery; UNIDO 2011b).

But pinning down job numbers is a challenge, 
not  least  for  the  methodological  and  definitional 
reasons  suggested  above  (see,  for  example,  Bowen 
2012).  Statistics  rarely  capture  self-employment 
or the informal economy, especially in developing 
countries where reliable and comprehensive data are 
scarce.

Still,  the  literature  abounds  with  estimates  for 
green  jobs,  and  usually  suggests  that  numbers  are 
increasing steadily (for example, Renner, Sweeney and 
Kubit 2008). It may also claim that tens of millions of 
green jobs have been created worldwide, with a growth 
surge over the past few years, notably in renewable 
energy and ecosystem services, such as forestry (ILO 
2012).

Many  sector-specific  studies  estimate  numbers. 
Rutovitz  and  Atherton  (2009)  estimate  9  million 
jobs  were  created  in  energy  globally  in  2010,  with 
about 20 percent of jobs created by renewable energy 
and energy-efficient generation. Renner, Sweeney and 
Kubit (2008) “conservatively” put jobs in renewable 
and supplier industries at 2.3 million worldwide.

India alone may be able to create some 900,000 
jobs by 2020 (from 2007) in biomass gasification. Of 
these, 300,000 might be among manufacturers of gas-
ifier stoves (including masons and metal fabricators) 
and  600,000  in  biomass  production,  supply  chain 
operations  and  after-sales  services.  Another  10,000 
people might find employment in advanced biomass 
cooking technologies (Holdren 2007).

UNEP  (2011b)  estimates  that  waste  recycling 
employs  12  million  people  in  just  three  countries 
– Brazil, China and the United States. Sorting and 
processing  recyclables  alone  sustain  10  times  more 
jobs than land filling or incineration based on weight. 
Basic  manufacturing  industries  such  as  steel,  alu-
minium, cement and paper are starting to stimulate 
green jobs through scrap use, greater energy efficiency 

and reliance on alternative energy sources (Renner, 
Sweeney and Kubit 2008).

Potential for green jobs
Energy is the emblematic example of sectoral “green-
ing”. Renewable energy (excluding large hydropower) 
represented almost half the new generation capacity 
added globally in 2011, up from a minuscule share just 
a few years earlier. Global investments in renewable 
power and fuels rose by 17 percent to $257 billion in 
2011 – for comparison, investment in fossil-fuel gen-
erating capacity was $302 billion – with about a third 
of that in developing countries (REN21 2012; UNEP 
and BNEF 2012).

Evaluations  of  the  impact  of  green  technol-
ogy on employment are rare. One that used model 
simulation  and  scenario  analysis  estimated  the 
impact of a “green investment” scenario on indus-
try.  Assuming  that  3  percent  of  total  additional 
green  investment  was  allocated  to  improving  the 
efficiency  of  industrial  energy,  it  estimated  that 
109  million  jobs  would  be  created  by  2050,  or 
15 percent more than in the business-as-usual base-
line scenario (UNEP 2011b).

Waste collection seems to offer promising returns 
on  investment.  In  the  same  simulation  the  green 
investment  scenario  then  allocated  0.16  percent  of 
global GDP to three areas of waste management, pri-
oritizing investment in the first two, waste recycling 
and composting of agricultural and forestry organic 
waste (including energy recovery), to support mate-
rial recovery and agricultural activities; the remaining 
investment was in waste collection.

About $33 billion a year was allocated to waste 
recycling and composting over the period, based on 
a global average estimated cost of recycling of $100 
per tonne of waste. Waste collection alone generated 
almost 10 percent of the additional jobs worldwide 
expected by 2050 in this scenario over the baseline, 
reflecting current low rates of collection and recycling 
in low-income countries.

on total employment is probably quite small

Table 6.1 
Debate on issues of green jobs

Proposition/hypothesis
Investments in green jobs will boost 
productive employment

Green jobs promote employment 
growth

Supporters
By raising overall employment, 
green investments provide new 
opportunities to previously 
unemployed and to underemployed 
workers, thus raising productivity of 
both groups
Investments in, say, energy efficiency 
or renewable energy create more jobs 
than in conventional energy

Green job forecasts are reliable

It is difficult to go beyond the science 
limits

Source: UNIDO, based on Morriss et al. (2009a,b) and Pollin (2009).

Detractors
Green job estimates commonly 
include clerical, bureaucratic and 
administrative positions that do not 
produce goods and services for 
consumption

By promoting more jobs instead of 
more productivity, green jobs actually 
encourage low-paying jobs in less 
desirable conditions
Estimates are based on disputed 
methodology and questionable 
assumptions

communications  technologies,  repair  and  mainte-
nance, and substitute and recycled materials will be in 
greater demand (ILO 2012).

Evidence  is  mixed  on  the  employment  effects 
across economies as a whole, with most research sug-
gesting that the impact of green structural changes 
on total employment is probably quite small (OECD 
2011).  Moreover,  an  increase  in  renewable  energy 
prices may raise overall energy prices throughout the 
economy,  offsetting  some  of  the  gains.  Production 
and employment in other sectors of the economy can 
also  be  held  down  when  the  energy  sector  absorbs 
more  workers  and  greater  investment  in  physical 
capacity.

How much policy support to give?
From  a  policy  perspective,  the  prospects  for  green 
jobs are far more interesting than current headcount 
figures. The literature on the outlook and on the level 
of state support that associated policies should receive 
reflects the debate on this topic, which is closely linked 
to questions on the degree of state intervention in a 
market economy (Table 6.1).

Studies relying on general equilibrium models tend 
to be less optimistic about the overall impact of renew-
able  energy  expansion  on  employment.  Concretely, 
some  studies  disregard  the  potential  effects  of  the 
investments  elsewhere  in  the  economy,  possibly  in 
another sector.

Resolving these issues is not merely academic, 
but  key  for  policy  in  that  they  form  the  founda-
tion (sometimes motivation) for interventions: the 
debate is almost reduced to the trade-offs between 
policy objectives in environmental protection, job 
creation  and  economic  growth.  These  goals  con-
verge in some cases, but not always. But the aspira-
tions for further socioeconomic development and 
environmental concerns can be reconciled through 
adjustments that help in decoupling – put simply, 
dissociating  the  “environmental  bads”  from  the 
“economic  goods”  (OECD  2002).  Globally,  the 
political  will  to  support  greener  industries  and 
associated employment stems from rising concerns 
over resource dependency and security (Dittrich et 
al. 2012).

Notes
1.  As an example, secondary scrap-based steel pro-
duction  requires  up  to  7  percent  less  energy 
than  primary  production,  and  employs  around 
200,000  people  worldwide  (Renner,  Sweeney 
and Kubit 2008). Energy-efficiency measures also 
have high yield potential (UNIDO 2011b). Other 
related measures, such as resource substitution, 
eco-innovation and industrial symbiosis, all offer 
prospects  for  improving  resource  productivity 
cost-effectively, primarily in developing countries 
(Dobbs et al. 2011).

Kuznets  who  postulated  that  income  inequal-
ity first rises as economic activity increases, then 
plateaus and finally decreases. This relationship 
would thus form an inverted U shape, implying 
that  a  certain  level  of  economic  activity  needs 

to  be  reached  before  income  inequality  can 
decouple.

3.  This is because green jobs relate to occupations 
and  skills  with  an  identifiable  environmen-
tal  focus,  but  environment-related  jobs  include 
employment  in  industries  (or  projects)  whose 
products are deemed of environmental benefit.

One  important  message  from  the  previous  sec-
tion was that the effect of drivers on employment is 
not  straightforward  and  not  always  unambiguous. 
Ensuring that it is beneficial often depends on having 
the right combination of government policies in place.
The third section of the report thus turns to exam-
ine the role of industrial policy in promoting structural 
change and employment generation. In its first chapter 
it begins by looking at the policy efforts needed at the 
national level to achieve this change. After discussing 
the different roles and instruments governments have 
in targeting drivers of structural change, it underlines 
the importance of understanding the specific condi-
tions of countries attempting to transform themselves 
and of using tailor-made policies. While policy con-
tent attuned to concrete realities is a necessity, another 
strong message is that getting the policy- making pro-
cess right is crucial, as is consensual implementation: 
proper  coordination  among  stakeholders;  engaged 
political leadership; public– private dialogue; manage-
ment capability; and flexibility in execution are just a 

few of the key dimensions that make industrial poli-
cies work.

The second chapter then highlights human capital 
for manufacturing structural change. It is one of the 
policy areas where, arguably, more consensus could 
be  achieved  among  views  of  what  a  government’s 
role should be in promoting industrialization, and so 
deserves special attention in this report.

The final chapter of the section addresses whether 
current international arrangements provide the neces-
sary policy space for countries to be able to engage in 
structural change and, through it, generate employ-
ment.  It  analyses  international  collaboration  as 
expressed in bilateral investment treaties in attracting 
foreign direct investment, the role of private sustain-
ability standards in avoiding the “race to the bottom”, 
and the role of international knowledge exchange for 
best practices in learning. It ends with a glance at what 
the post-2015 development agenda might entail for 
manufacturing  structural  change  and  employment 
generation.

Chapter 7
Industrial policy

Industrial  policy  should  seek  to  promote  struc-
tural  change:  from  agriculture  to  labour-intensive 
or resource-based manufacturing at an early stage of 
industrialization; through upgrading and diversifica-
tion in manufacturing at a later stage; and through 
technological innovation at an advanced stage.

The state can promote policy either as a regulator, 
financier, producer or consumer, using policy instru-
ments that target key drivers of structural change: edu-
cation and skills, capital and technology, and material 
inputs. In this targeting the state should oversee close 
coordination with other policies such as those on com-
petition, trade and foreign direct investment (FDI), as 
well as the exchange rate, as they can undermine the 
objectives of industrial policy if they are misaligned.

Carefully chosen and implemented interventions 
can promote industrial growth and employment, as 
confirmed by solid evidence from the results of impact 
evaluations  for  high-income  countries  published  in 
2010  and  2012.  (Subsidies  for  competitive  sectors 
may be one promising approach.) But while interna-
tional experience with policy instruments can provide 
interesting lessons, developing countries are unlikely 
to succeed with simple emulation, because a strategic 
approach to industrial policy-making has to be tai-
lored to their own circumstances.

Evidence-based  and  realistic  industrial  policy 
implemented  in  a  consensual  way  is  key  for  policy 
effectiveness, irrespective of the concrete instruments 
used. This would require measures to:
•  Use – do not fight – the political system. A fact of 
political life is that no policy will be underwritten 
unless those in power agree to it.

•  Strengthen  political  leadership.  This  will  set  a 
national transformation agenda that aims, in low-
income countries, to create and nurture produc-
tive activities or, in middle-income countries, to 
advance technologically.

•  Encourage public–private dialogue. This will help 
to both design interventions that draw on expert 

knowledge in the private sector and ensure that all 
key stakeholders support decisions.

•  Boost  industrial  policy  management  capabilities. 
These capabilities have to be strengthened consid-
erably among key actors in developing countries in 
a pragmatic and concentrated way, ideally through 
learning by doing.
Finally, developing countries should initiate their 
own national industrial policy experimentation and 
learning processes, including monitoring and evalua-
tion, to identify high-impact solutions.

Promoting structural change through 
industrial policy
Industrial policy is a widely used term but difficult 
to define. Warwick (2013, p. 15) suggests “any type 
of intervention or government policy that attempts 
to improve the business environment or to alter the 
structure of economic activity towards sectors, tech-
nologies or tasks that are expected to offer better pros-
pects for economic growth or societal welfare than 
would occur in the absence of such intervention, i.e. in 
the market equilibrium”.1

The main objective of industrial policy is to “antic-
ipate structural change, facilitating it by removing 
obstacles and correcting for market failures” (Syrquin 
2007). Hausmann and Rodrik (2003, 2006) identify 
three main types of market failure that are particu-
larly relevant for new activities to emerge (thus chang-
ing the industrial structure), where identification and 
correction provide a rationale for industrial policy: 
coordination externalities, as specific new industries 
or activities require simultaneous, large investments 
to  become  profitable;  information  externalities,  as 
discovery  of  new  activities  requires  an  investment 
whose returns cannot be fully appropriated by the 
investor; and labour training externalities, as firms 
regard labour mobility as a disincentive to invest in 
on-the-job  training,  thus  reducing  technological 
spillovers.

132

“ Influencing and planning strategically a 

country’s position in an international setting has 
gained importance as an industrial policy objective

Financial  market  failures  sometimes  provide  a 
major justification for industrial policy through the 
creation of special financial instruments for small and 
medium-size  enterprises  (SMEs),  or  special  financ-
ing institutions like development banks to finance, 
say, new products, firms entering new markets or new 
technologies.

Finally, the role of influencing and planning stra-
tegically a country’s position in an international set-
ting  has  gained  importance  as  an  industrial  policy 
objective during an age when value chains get more 
fragmented and there are more options for countries 
and regions to plug themselves into international and 
regional production networks.

But industrial policies have not been free of con-
troversy, even though they have been extensively used 
in the developed and developing worlds. In the dec-
ades after World War II advanced countries success-
fully  implemented  industrial  policies  –  usually  the 
tricky part – as, for example, France through indica-
tive planning, Finland through technology policy and 
Ireland  through  the  targeting  of  high-tech  foreign 
investment  (Weiss  2011).  In  the  developing  world 
East Asia from the 1960s provides good examples of 
success: starting with Japan and continuing with the 
Republic of Korea, Singapore and Taiwan Province of 
China, governments took extensive measures to pro-
mote industry, depending on the country’s develop-
ment stage. These different stages are reviewed below.

Early stage: from agriculture to 
low-technology manufacturing
At the initial stage of industrialization agriculture is 
still the largest sector for employment, though it tends 
to  be  the  least  productive  (Herrendorf,  Rogerson 
and Valentinyi 2013). This lower productivity than 
in the more advanced sectors leaves a great potential 
untapped,  suggesting  that  manufacturing  can  still 
play a major role as an engine of growth through the 
reallocation of resources (see Chapter 1).

To  promote  structural  change  by  moving  from 
agriculture to manufacturing, low-income countries 
need to align agricultural and industrial policies. They 

need agricultural development strategies with a strong 
emphasis  on  increasing  agricultural  productivity, 
which will translate into cheaper agricultural prod-
ucts and release a typically unskilled and cheap labour 
force. And to absorb the released labour and to ben-
efit from cheaper agricultural inputs, industrial policy 
should seek to create or support labour-intensive and 
resource-based manufacturing with low entry barriers, 
which are likely to favour industrial SMEs important 
for broadening the industrial base. Support for SME 
development should thus be an integral part of indus-
trial policy at this early stage.

Climbing the ladder: towards more 
technologically advanced industries
In countries that have reached the middle-income range 
or are on track to do so, such as Brazil, China, Malaysia 
and Thailand, the contribution of agriculture to GDP 
and employment has declined, due to a greater share of 
industry, particularly manufacturing. Although low-
tech manufacturing subsectors still play an important 
but decreasing role, some medium- and high-tech indus-
tries increase their employment (see Chapter 3). While 
the latter sectors tend to create fewer jobs than low-tech 
manufacturing,  they  provide  more  high-skilled  jobs 
with positive spillover effects on the economy.

The  above  observations  suggest  that  industrial 
policy  should  focus  on  two  issues.  First,  because 
unemployment is likely to remain a critical issue in 
most  middle-income  countries,  industrial  policy 
should aim to improve efficiency and productivity in 
labour-intensive and low-tech sectors to increase com-
petitiveness. Yet as per capita income grows, compet-
ing on cost with low-income countries will become 
increasingly difficult, bringing forth a second issue: 
middle-income countries will need to diversify and 
upgrade their economic structure towards more tech-
nologically advanced sectors.

Government  intervention  is  needed  to  favour  a 
shift towards higher value, higher tech or skill-inten-
sive industries and to build the required productive 
and technological capabilities, with a sharper focus on 
the quality rather than quantity of jobs.2

governments to promote industry in areas 
such as production, investment, research 
and development, exports and training

Keeping technological leadership: innovation
Although  reindustrialization  is  now  on  the  agenda 
of  many  high-income  countries,  they  cannot  com-
pete  in  low-cost,  mature  segments  of  industry.  So 
they should pursue differentiation (by raising qual-
ity) and innovation (by launching new products and 
services) – a strategy that may be prescient given their 
relative abundance of highly educated labour. In par-
ticular, although global manufacturing production is 
shifting gradually from high-income to lower income 
countries, innovation remains dominated by countries 
in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and 
Development (OECD; Pilat et al. 2006).

The  differentiation  and  innovation  strategy 
requires countries to shift resources into promising 
new  areas  so  as  to  expand  the  global  technological 
frontier. The shift towards new technological trajecto-
ries, which are desirable from an industrial–dynamic 
or social (“green technology”) perspective, will require 
an  industrial  policy  that  removes  obstacles.  It  has 
therefore to be aligned with competition and innova-
tion policies to reduce entry barriers, and instruments 
have to be designed to favour innovative new entrants 
and  counter  incumbents’  industrial  advantages,  as 
well as their lobbying power.

Manufacturing-related services, too, should be a 
key element in high-income countries. Although these 
countries typically show waning reliance on manufac-
turing as a source of growth and increasing depend-
ence on services, links between industrial and service 
activities have become important because of the greater 
share of service activities necessary for or complemen-
tary to manufacturing production (see Chapter 3).

Industrial policy instruments – four 
main categories
According to Peres and Primi (2009), the state can 
promote industrial development in four main ways: 
as a regulator establishing tariffs, fiscal incentives or 
subsidies; as a financier influencing the credit market 
and allocating public and private financial resources 
to  industrial  projects;  as  a  producer  participating 
directly in economic activity through, for example, 

state-owned enterprises (SOEs); and as a consumer 
guaranteeing a market for strategic industries through 
public procurement programmes.

This subsection discusses the main policy instru-
ments for these roles, and notes that successful indus-
trial policy is not only about picking winners but also 
about letting losers go (Günther and Alcorta 2011). 
Beneficiaries should be aware that government sup-
port is time limited (through “sunset clauses”) and 
based on performance incentives.

The state as regulator
Fiscal  incentives  are  government  transfers  of  pub-
lic resources to firms, activities, whole industries or 
regions, free or at below-market rates, made through 
direct subsidies (cash or in kind) or indirect subsidies 
(tax incentives).

Direct subsidies are important for national govern-
ments to promote industry in areas such as production, 
investment, research and development (R&D), exports 
and training. It is important to distinguish between 
generic subsidies from sectorial ones. The former may 
encourage investment but not structural change. The 
areas requiring support depend on a country’s char-
acteristics.  Advanced  countries  consider  R&D  sub-
sidies  to  be  legitimate  industrial  policy  for  promot-
ing  high-tech  industries,  but  they  generally  oppose 
export subsidies – also prohibited by the World Trade 
Organization  (WTO)  –  which  target  a  particular 
activity in which emerging market countries are typi-
cally strong (Naudé 2010). But during the 2008 global 
financial crisis France, Germany and the United States 
resorted to direct subsidies to bail out manufacturing 
firms, particularly in the automotive industry.

Indirect subsidies (tax incentives) present no general 
model for promoting manufacturing. While many com-
mentators attribute part of the Asian growth story to tax 
incentives, some recommend governments to limit their 
use (James 2009). In fact, tax systems in many countries 
have been subject to comprehensive reforms, curtailing 
the use of incentives for investment. The United Nations, 
World Bank, OECD and International Monetary Fund 
all recognize the importance for developing countries to

7“ Recognizing the importance of 

manufacturing SMEs in the economy, many 
countries have developed subsidized loan 
schemes to support their development

find “the right balance between an attractive tax regime 
for domestic and foreign investment, by using tax incen-
tives, for example, and securing the necessary revenues 
for public spending” (IMF et al. 2011, p. 10).

The fact is that the tax incentives offered by indi-
vidual countries now more than ever affect the choice 
of enterprises with regard to where to set up a business 
(James 2009). Countries can no longer design their 
tax systems in isolation but have to consider those of 
other countries thanks to the global mobility of capi-
tal and labour, but they risk engaging in harmful tax 
competition. Such countries are also concerned that 
once  the  tax  holiday  expires,  manufacturing  enter-
prises, often very mobile, will move their operations to 
another country that lures them with incentives.

The state as financier
A well-functioning financial market is crucial to boost 
industrial development through the provision of com-
petitive lending for working capital, leasing of capital 
goods, consultancy services, and loans for fixed assets 
including investment projects and real-estate develop-
ment. Access to reasonably priced credit is a key con-
straint for SMEs particularly, even for those with pro-
jects having positive private and social returns, as they 
usually lack collateral or credit history.

Recognizing  the  importance  of  manufacturing 
SMEs in the economy, many countries have developed 

subsidized  loan  schemes  to  support  their  develop-
ment. Under the execution of the Small and Medium 
Industry  Development  Organization,  the  Turkish 
government has targeted manufacturing enterprises 
through the SME Credit Support Mechanism, which 
offers interest rate support for bank loans.

Governments can also offer guarantee schemes to 
increase lender confidence in making investments in 
SMEs, by supporting either debt or equity finance, to 
ensure more credit or better credit terms for targeted 
sectors  or  groups.  The  Egyptian  Credit  Guarantee 
Company, established by the government as a joint-
stock  company,  had  a  guarantee  coverage  of  only 
50 percent with a low risk-sharing rate, but the guar-
antee has nevertheless proved “attractive to banks in 
Egypt because the guarantee fund is actually depos-
ited in participating banks” (Levitsky 1997, p. 7).

Launched in 2000, the Small Business Guarantee 
Fund (FOGAPE) in Chile guarantees a share of loans 
made by banks to SMEs, small exporters and small 
business associations, with a maximum of 50–80 per-
cent according to credit type. No doubt partly due to 
FOGAPE, the share of SMEs with access to credit is 
far higher (estimated in 2007 at 93 percent at least) 
than in many other countries (Agosin, Larraín and 
Grau 2010).

National development banks hold a special place 
as industrial policy tools (Box 7.1). They are typically

The Brazilian Development Bank

Founded  in  1952,  the  Brazilian  development  Bank 
(Bndes) is wholly owned by the federal government. Its 
mission is “to foster sustainable and competitive devel-
opment in the Brazilian economy, generating employment 
while reducing social and regional inequalities” (Bndes 
n.d.).  Bndes,  the  largest  creditor  in  south  america,  is 
a main source of long-term financing to Brazilian enter-
prises, with annual disbursements climbing sharply from 
$11.7 billion in 2003 to $82.3 billion in 2011 (Colby 2012).

the government uses Bndes as a key instrument in 
implementing industrial, infrastructure and foreign trade 
policies. Manufacturing industry is central to the agenda 
of Bndes and received around 40 percent of the Bank’s 

total disbursements in 1995–2012 (Banco Central do Bra-
sil n.d.).

Bndes  supports  manufacturing  firms  through  the 
following  measures:  finance  for  investment  projects  to 
establish and upgrade plants, modernize processes and 
spur technological upgrading and innovation; funding for 
production, sales, acquisition or leasing of new machin-
ery and equipment; support for production and export of 
goods and services marketed abroad; and facilitation of 
changes in firm ownership and project risk sharing (otta-
viano and de sousa 2007).

7“ As a consumer, a national government 

can be the single largest buyer in several 
markets for goods and services in a country

“set  up  to  foster  economic  development,  often  tak-
ing into account objectives of social development and 
regional integration, mainly by providing long-term 
financing to, or facilitating the financing of, projects 
generating positive externalities” (UNDESA 2006b, 
pp. 10–11). Most of these banks focus on sectors that 
governments consider strategically important for the 
long-term development of the domestic economy, and 
act as catalysts for expanding targeted sectors and as 
facilitators of structural change.

In the longer run countries could aim at correct-
ing credit market failures by strengthening institu-
tions to reduce asymmetric information costs through 
credit  bureaus,  improve  legal  and  judicial  enforce-
ment institutions and influence informal institutions 
by promoting a “repayment culture” (Meléndez and 
Perry 2010). The provision of credit rating systems is 
particularly important, and this type of information 
service should be introduced by governments if not 
developed by the private sector.

The state as producer
In  pursuing  development  objectives  the  state  has 
historically  played  a  key  role  in  industrial  develop-
ment  through  SOEs.  State  ownership  can  be  justi-
fied when there are natural monopolies unsuitable for 
private enterprises, for social or developmental goals, 
to achieve investment returns for supporting budg-
etary objectives, and for national economic security 
(Mattlin 2009). They can also act as incubators for 
technical  skills  and  managerial  talent,  as  in  China 
(Rodrik 2010).

Although there are good arguments to privatize 
enterprises, the state can succeed as an entrepreneur. 
A well-known example is the Republic of Korea’s steel 
firm, POSCO, which began production in 1973, at 
a time where the country’s biggest export items were 
fish, cheap apparel, wigs and plywood. It became the 
most  efficient  producer  in  the  global  steel  industry 
in  10  years  (Chang  2006).  Likewise,  Embraer,  the 
state-owned  Brazilian  aircraft  company,  has  estab-
lished itself as a key player in the aerospace industry. 
European countries had used state subsidies and SOEs 

to  expand  at  an  unprecedented  rate  for  more  than 
three decades after World War II, but shifted towards 
privatization, deregulation and competition at the end 
of the 1970s (Ulltveit-Moe 2008).

The state as consumer
As  a  consumer,  a  national  government  can  be  the 
single largest buyer in several markets for goods and 
services in a country. It can use this purchasing power 
to stimulate economic activity and innovation, pro-
tect  national  industry  against  foreign  competition, 
improve competitiveness of some industrial sectors or 
remedy regional disparities (Watermeyer 2000). For 
example, to develop or improve the competitiveness 
of selected sectors, public procurement was used after 
World War II in East Asia (Kattel and Lember 2010). 
Countries there started by identifying the products as 
well as the technological capabilities and know-how 
needed to produce them. Procurement contracts were 
then awarded to domestic firms with the government 
setting deadlines and quality standards to ensure con-
tinuing improvement and productivity in these tar-
geted products.

States use several approaches (Yülek and Taylor 
2012). A government can “buy domestic” to support 
selected industrial sectors, as illustrated by the Buy 
America Act in the United States, which gives pref-
erence  to  domestic  products  in  federal  government 
procurements. Similarly, local content rules – requir-
ing a share of the procured product to be produced 
by domestic firms – can support domestic industry 
in two ways: first, by providing a market to domes-
tic business (even when the procurement contract is 
awarded to a foreign firm) as well as employment and 
income to the country; second, by helping domestic 
businesses acquire know-how, transfer technology and 
lower unit costs through learning-curve effects.

Countertrade agreements are another approach, 
and build reciprocity into a transaction by requiring 
a foreign seller to purchase specified products from 
domestic firms. One example is an offset arrangement 
where a government requires a foreign firm to trans-
fer economic benefits (beyond cash) to the domestic

policy instruments that provide explicit 
incentives for human capital investments by 
firms and households, beyond the government’s 
required investments in education

economy as a condition for awarding a procurement 
contract. These benefits may include technology trans-
fer, managerial services, investment, credit transfer, 
licensed production or co-production, with a view to 
improving domestic productive capabilities.

Public procurement usually needs strong govern-
ment  capabilities,  and  often  generates  controversy 
among foreign companies, which may request applica-
tion of the WTO principle of equal treatment (Yülek 
and Taylor 2012).

Targeting key drivers of structural 
change
Industrial policy instruments can be used to target key 
drivers of structural change (see Chapter 4): education 
and skills, technology and innovation, and material 
inputs.

Education and skills
Education and skills3 are essential to build produc-
tive  capacities  for  national  industrial  development, 
yet would be underprovided in a pure market-driven 
environment as employers have too few incentives to 
provide funds for training and education because of 
labour mobility (the employee may move to another 
firm). Likewise, there is typically insufficient private 
spending on education as individuals base their invest-
ment decisions on private returns, not social returns. 
Further, employees would have few chances to self-
finance the acquisition of human capital because it is 
extremely hard to “mortgage” future expected returns 
(a financial market failure).

So, training and education call for industrial pol-
icy  instruments  that  provide  explicit  incentives  for 
human capital investments by firms and households, 
beyond  the  government’s  required  investments  in 
education. These instruments include scholarships or 
long-term loans for undergraduate and graduate uni-
versity  studies  (at  home  and  abroad);  vocational  or 
engineering scholarships to carry out in-house train-
ing of prospective workers by firms; wage subsidies as 
an incentive for firms to hire and train more employ-
ees; demand-driven courses to train workers in the 

technical standards in certain industries; and business 
training for owners and managers of SMEs in issues 
like  management,  finance,  accounting  and  invest-
ment analysis. Although countries have introduced 
policy measures to support such skills, the national 
training fund is increasingly popular (see Box 8.3 in 
Chapter 8).

Technology and innovation
Technology and innovation are crucial for strengthen-
ing industrial competitiveness. Yet limited appropri-
ability, lack of competitive finance, and coordination 
failures,  among  other  factors,  make  them  prone  to 
market failures and induce underinvestment relative 
to the socially optimal level (Martin and Scott 2000). 
Government intervention to promote adopting tech-
nology and innovation to upgrade domestic private 
sector  capabilities  is  required.  Countries  have  very 
different capabilities in this area, often dictating dif-
ferent policies, but most policy instruments finance 
and provide public inputs or information (Melo 2001) 
and include grants (typically non-reimbursable), subsi-
dized loans and fiscal incentives (see above).

Innovation requires strong links between universi-
ties and research institutions and enterprises. To cre-
ate those links, technological platforms can be estab-
lished to provide forums where firms in a particular 
sector (or region) can identify technological obstacles 
and  define  the  actions  to  remove  them,  partnering 
with  research  institutions.  Similarly,  technological 
centres or institutions can be set up to offer consult-
ing to firms in various areas, such as product or process 
R&D; metrology, normalization, and certification ser-
vices; and technology choice and adaptation (Box 7.2).
In public procurement schemes for innovation, a 
government agency places orders to purchase a prod-
uct that does not yet exist or needs to be customized 
but that could probably be developed within a reason-
able time through additional R&D, in this way lift-
ing the producers’ innovative capacity. The Internet 
and global positioning technology are two examples 
of  government  innovation-oriented  procurement 
from  the  United  States  (Kattel  and  Lember  2010),

Fundación Chile

a private, non-profit organization created in 1976 by the 
government of Chile and Itt Corporation, Fundación Chile 
focuses its main research on adapting and applying tech-
nologies in commercial operation elsewhere to the Chil-
ean environment, though it sometimes conducts original 
research. Its best-known success is salmon cultivation, 
developed in norway and scotland.

Material inputs
As  a  reliable  supply  system  of  low-cost  and  high-
quality material inputs is crucial for local industrial 
production, countries lacking it sometimes use policy 
instruments to reduce the costs of inputs. A “linkage 
creation” policy seeks to identify the main require-
ments for inputs and raw materials from large firms, 
and  match  this  demand  with  local  suppliers,  often 
SMEs. More important, the policy should promote 
the development of local suppliers through technical 
assistance. Likewise, trade liberalization can reduce 
costs of imported inputs, benefiting local manufac-
turers,  particularly  those  targeting  export  markets, 
through  productivity  and  competitiveness  gains 
(Amiti and Konings 2007; Topalova and Khandelwal 
2011). For their part, tariff incentives allow firms to 
partially  or  totally  recover  some  taxes  or  duties  on 
imported inputs, while temporary admission schemes 
give  to  importing  firms  partial  or  total  exemption 
from duties on input materials used in production.

In the current global context of increased resource 
scarcity and availability, industrial policy instruments 
must support green structural change (see Chapter 
6), involving three categories of policy instruments to 
alter firms’ behaviour.4

Market-based instruments. Instruments such as taxes, 
subsidies  and  tradable  permits  consider  the  costs 
of  pollution  and  environmental  degradation  in  the 
pricing of goods and services. For example, material 
input taxes seek to encourage a more efficient use of 
resources  and  to  promote  more  material-efficient 
production  technologies;  they  are  applied  to  each 
(physical) unit of virgin extraction. They are already 
levied on a few resources (usually minerals) in some 
countries, including Bulgaria, Canada, Denmark and 
France. Tradable resource-use permits can be rights to 
emit pollutants (including greenhouse gas emissions) 
or rights to access natural resources (such as water) 
that are allocated to firms, which may trade them. The 
aim is to encourage firms to use existing opportunities 
to  reduce  resource  use  and  particularly  to  develop 
innovative resource-saving technologies, to profit from 
unused permits.

Financial  incentives  or  subsidies  can  also  be 
used for resource-saving research and technological 
innovation, but subsidies that encourage overuse of 
natural  resources  should  be  removed.  All  subsidies 
should be time bound, well targeted and performance 
monitored.

Regulatory  and  voluntary  instruments.  Norms  and 
standards  that  set  binding  limits  can  be  defined 
by  public  authorities  to  achieve  goals  like  reducing 
emissions  and  waste  or  increasing  resource  or 
energy  efficiency.  Bans  are  more  stringent,  and

than particular firms, it can be quite compatible 
– in fact complementary – to competition policy

typically imposed on toxic materials. The Stockholm 
Convention focuses, for instance, on eliminating or 
reducing the release of 12 persistent organic pollutants. 
Beyond regulatory measures, voluntary agreements or 
negotiated environmental agreements can also be used 
to address, say, pollution and energy efficiency targets 
as well as reporting requirements.

Information-based instruments. Governments can use 
various measures to increase awareness by providing 
information on resource efficiencies and sustainable 
industrial production. Information-based approaches 
include using environmental data, indicators and eco-
labelling or certification. Designed and implemented 
well,  they  can  strengthen  the  effectiveness  of 
other  policy  instruments  such  as  environmental 
taxes.  Finally,  data  and  indicators  should  facilitate 
benchmarking as a way to determine the resource or 
energy efficiency of a system.

Aligning industrial and other policies
The targeting of key drivers requires close coordina-
tion  with  other  policies  –  notably  on  competition, 
trade  and  FDI,  and  exchange  rates  –  that  play  an 
important complementary role to industrial policy.5 
Failure to exploit these synergies may counteract pol-
icy objectives.

Competition policy
Competition policy includes competition legislation, 
which  aims  to  prevent  agreements  between  firms 
restricting  competition  (cartels),  abuse  of  market 
power by dominant firms, and mergers or acquisitions 
that may create a dominant player and weaken com-
petition. It may also include competition advocacy, 
which aims to promote (if needed, set up) a culture of 
competition.

Competition  and  industrial  policies  are  often 
viewed as mutually conflicting. This is because com-
petition policy typically aims to foster rivalry between 
firms  in  an  industry  for  greater  efficiency  and  eco-
nomic  welfare,  while  industrial  policy  frequently 
gives a market advantage over competitors (including 

producers of substitute products) to favoured domestic 
sectors or industries.

Two areas of possible conflict stand out (Brooks 
2007). The first relates to new entry. There is a conflict 
zone between a high degree of competition (“contest-
ability”) in markets and the willingness of firms to 
commit large investments into developing new prod-
ucts and new types of technologies or branching out 
into new areas of international specialization. Thus 
where innovation is crucial, protection of intellectual 
property rights is needed through patents, copyrights 
and trademarks, as temporary monopoly rents provide 
incentives to invest in creating or improving products, 
services or processes.

The  second  area  concerns  competition  between 
domestic  and  foreign  firms,  as  entry  of  the  foreign 
firms usually increases competition in the short term 
and may threaten domestic ones. Governments may 
be tempted to use industrial policy to impede foreign 
entry, but they should also consider the possible posi-
tive effects of FDI on the endowments and productiv-
ity of factors of production, as well as spillover effects. 
The mode of foreign entry also matters, as mergers and 
acquisitions may result in abuse of market power by a 
dominant player, violating competition policy.

Aghion et al. (2012) argue that if industrial policy 
targets sectors rather than particular firms, it can be 
quite compatible – in fact complementary – to com-
petition  policy  (see  also  Possas  and  Borges  2009). 
In  order  words,  competition  policy  can  be  used  to 
foster competition within sectors or industries that 
were picked by industrial policy, as in the Republic 
of Korea where intense competition between chaebol 
was ensured in the domestic market, or in Japan where 
oligopolistic rivalry rather than single national cham-
pions  was  promoted  (Brooks  2007).  Competitive 
pressures within an industry can also be maintained if 
instruments use sunset clauses (Rodrik 2004).

Finally,  industrial  policy  seeks  to  favour  tech-
nologies or tasks expected to offer better prospects 
for  economic  growth  or  societal  welfare.  Given  its 
greater  emphasis  on  the  long-term  development 
path, industrial policy can be given precedence over

7“ Climbing up the ladder in the seemingly 

hierarchical structure of international production 
and trade relationships has become a prime 
target of trade and industrial policies

competition policy. But competition policy provides 
a framework or contributes to “proper governance” of 
industrial policies. A strong and independent compe-
tition authority with clear and transparent rules for 
decision-making can be an important complementary 
agency for forward-looking industrial policy meas-
ures,  as  in  the  European  Union  (EU),  where  com-
petition policy is at the EU level and so somewhat 
removed from capture by national lobbying efforts of 
incumbent firms.

Trade and foreign direct investment policy
Trade policy no doubt played an important role in 
countries’ catch up by imposing direct import restric-
tions (tariffs, quotas and non-tariff barriers), offering 
preferable  treatment  to  domestic  producers  on  the 
domestic market (public procurement policies) and 
providing  export  support  (export  credits,  and  sup-
port to access foreign markets and export-processing 
zones; Chang 2003). Today, although some trade and 
FDI policies have been restricted through bilateral or 
multilateral trade policy agreements, governments still 
have some space to use trade-related instruments for 
industrial policy.

Developments  over  recent  decades  have  been 
two-sided. There has been a strong increase in inter-
national integration, with a rising number of coun-
tries with liberalized trade regimes, leading to greater 
openness of their economies. But there has also been 
greater pressure on countries to move towards a more 
liberalized trade policy regime, but this can lead to 
specialization in products in which a country has a 
comparative advantage at the moment of liberaliza-
tion. For many developing countries this may translate 
into producing and exporting only low value-added 
products, such as agricultural commodities, or only 
low value-added manufactures, such as textiles and 
electronic components, characterized by low wages. 
So analysis and policy concerns have shifted toward a 
dynamic perception of the place that a country’s pro-
ducers occupy in international production structures 
(at the industry level) or international value chains (at 
the task or fragment level within industries).

Climbing up the ladder in this seemingly hierar-
chical structure of international production and trade 
relationships has become a prime target of trade and 
industrial policies. Such hierarchies have been opera-
tionalized in empirical research through rankings by 
capital-, skill-, technology- or R&D-intensities, lead-
ing to a focus on supporting a country’s move across 
ladders of such hierarchies. The role of foreign produc-
ers as sources of technology spillovers and as support 
for access to foreign markets has been recognized. As 
a result, great attention has been paid to incentivizing 
the channels through which such spillovers to domes-
tic producers would occur, such as through linkage 
programmes. Policies that try to encourage more use 
of domestic inputs by foreign firms may also play an 
important role in upgrading domestic industry and 
promoting structural change.

In addition to specialization, trade liberalization 
can also lead to deindustrialization, with rapid growth 
of manufactured imports, closure of some local indus-
tries and stagnation or low growth in industrial jobs 
(see, for example, Reinert 2006).

The upshot is that trade policy instruments pre-
viously used by successful countries like China and 
the Republic of Korea to restrict imports are being 
replaced by:
•  Non-tariff  barriers,  in  a  combination  of  import 
licensing, unjustified sanitary and phyto-sanitary 
conditions, a complex regulatory environment, red 
tape or lengthy customs procedures.

•  Export-promoting instruments that support export-
ers in areas such as access to competitive and diversi-
fied finance, market access, R&D and training.
As trade policy is a key component of any indus-
trial policy, the current policy space (such as under 
WTO rules) may need to be fully assessed and taken 
advantage of, or recovered if needed to promote struc-
tural change, particularly in developing countries (see 
Chapter 9).

7“ Well-designed industrial policies are 

a mechanism to promote employment 
generation, spur growth and improve welfare 
in developing and developed countries alike

between the domestic economy and its main trading 
partners) heavily influences industrial development. 
An appreciating real exchange rate makes a country’s 
manufactured products less price competitive, which 
affects competition on the domestic market relative to 
imports and competition of the country’s exports on 
foreign markets.6

An argument for policies targeting the tradable 
sector (through real exchange rate undervaluation, for 
instance) is that tradable activities (particularly manu-
facturing) are inherently scalable, in that economies 
can expand output without running into diminish-
ing  returns,  unlike  non-tradable  activities  (Rodrik 
2008a). Moreover, the scope for productivity growth 
and learning is higher in tradable than non-tradable 
activities.

In  trying  to  influence  real  exchange  rate  move-
ments,  authorities  have  to  deal  with  the  difference 
between the economy being in a fixed exchange rate 
regime (or even a currency union) and in a flexible 
exchange rate regime counterpart to its main trading 
partners. Closely monitoring the real exchange rate 
and keeping it undervalued to support the tradable 
sector, primarily manufacturing – including manipu-
lation of the nominal exchange rate – have featured in 
almost all successful catch-up countries (Gala 2008; 
Rodrik 1986, 2008a). These measures are also crucial 
to prevent the current account deficit from becom-
ing unsustainable, which would jeopardize industrial 
policy (McCombie and Thirlwall 2004).

Getting industrial policy to work – 
more than emulation required
Several recent design-based studies provide compel-
ling  empirical  evidence  that  carefully  chosen  and 
implemented industrial policy can promote industrial 
growth and employment. For instance, there is now 
robust evidence that subsidies to manufacturing firms 
can increase employment at comparably very low “cost 
per job” (Criscuolo et al. 2012). Well-allocated firm-
level subsidies can also boost total factor productivity 
(Aghion et al. 2012), and there is convincing evidence 
that tariffs that account for the varying skill levels 

among industries can boost economic growth (Nunn 
and Trefler 2010). These studies – discussed in more 
detail below – emphasize clean-research designs and 
use either randomized control trials or natural experi-
ments  to  identify  causal  effects,  helping  make  the 
industrial policy debate more objective.

Many  scholars  are  now  more  optimistic  that 
well-designed industrial policies are a mechanism to 
promote  employment  generation,  spur  growth  and 
improve welfare in developing and developed coun-
tries alike. Consequently, many of them demand to 
move  the  debate  from  whether  industrial  policies 
should  be  considered  at  all,  to  how  these  policies 
should be designed and implemented (for instance, 
Aghion et al. 2012; Rodrik 2008a).

This  subsection  summarizes  the  lessons  from 
selected impact evaluations of industrial policy inter-
ventions. It stresses that reproducing policy instru-
ments  in  different  countries  needs  to  be  handled 
cautiously, and that evaluations are crucial for experi-
mentation and learning.

Handle with care
The majority of industrial policy instruments in the 
past  were  deliberately  designed  to  achieve  a  set  of 
policy objectives. But in most cases prospective justi-
fications were not backed up by retrospective evalua-
tions of the results’ impact on objectives. This paucity 
of impact evaluations is a key constraint for a com-
prehensive and comparative appraisal of their future 
potential, their applicability in certain countries or 
sectors and their effectiveness for achieving growth 
and employment objectives.

In addition, most available analyses must be inter-
preted with great caution. First, many were not per-
formed thoroughly enough, so an assessment of their 
internal  validity  suggests  that  causal  relationships 
between policy instruments and observable impacts 
are  hard  to  establish.7  Second,  the  findings  on  the 
achievements  or  failures  that  can  be  distilled  from 
international experiences cannot that easily be gen-
eralized because of country heterogeneity, so careful 
case-by-case assessment is needed.

7“ Governments have many ways to subsidize 

firms, activities, whole industries or regions

In a nutshell no comparison of industrial policy 
instruments will find a “silver bullet”. Still, it is evident 
that the more comparable the two countries under 
review  are  in  their  stage  of  development,  country-
specific factors, evident challenges and so on, the more 
likely it is that comparable results can be achieved.

With these caveats the rest of this subsection pre-
sents the most convincing evidence of the potential 
success that carefully chosen and well-implemented 
instruments can bring about. It looks into the effects 
of  a  number  of  regularly  applied  industrial  policy 
instruments: first, subsidies and subsidized loans and 
fiscal incentives, then, trade policy instruments.

Subsidies, subsidized loans and fiscal incentives
Governments  have  many  ways  to  subsidize  firms, 
activities, whole industries or regions. Here, we refer 
to subsidies as any government action that allocates 
public  resources  –  cash,  financial  assets  and  tangi-
bles – for free or at below market prices. Many past 
cases involved SOEs and provided production inputs 
at below market prices, or government owned-banks 
that provided credit on preferential terms. Another 
way is reduced tax liabilities through tax exemptions, 
deductions or credits.

In  each  case  one  might  assume  that  the  crucial 
point  is  to  identify  and  subsidize  those  productive 
activities where public resources would have the high-
est impact on employment and growth. But many pol-
icy instruments in high-income countries are explic-
itly based on an equity rationale and do not focus on 
efficiency. These include place-based economic devel-
opment policies that target public resources at disad-
vantaged geographical areas rather than selected firms 
or disadvantaged groups of people. The most credible 
impact evaluations are for these place-based policies, 
and  some  design-based  studies  from  high-income 
countries provide evidence that such policies have the 
potential to promote employment and growth.

For example, Criscuolo et al. (2012) examine the 
most important business support scheme in the United 
Kingdom: Regional Selective Assistance, which has 
provided subsidies to firms (mainly in manufacturing) 

in deprived areas over the last 40 years. By firm size the 
authors find that the subsidy programme had strong, 
positive  effects  for  smaller  firms,  but  an  essentially 
zero  impact  on  larger  firms.8  Spatially,  the  authors 
find that the programme raised employment mainly 
by reducing unemployment and did not result in equal 
and offsetting falls in employment in non-participat-
ing firms. The programme increased employment (and 
investment) in deprived areas, where the authors esti-
mate the cost per job at about $6,300. They find no 
effects on total factor productivity.

Kline and Moretti (2012) evaluate the long-run 
impact  of  the  most  ambitious  US  place-based  eco-
nomic  development  policy:  the  Tennessee  Valley 
Authority programme launched in the 1930s, which 
aimed to improve regional economic activity mainly 
by investing in large-scale infrastructure programmes. 
The authors find that the policy has increased employ-
ment  in  manufacturing,  where  positive  effects  are 
still present over 70 years after launch. In agriculture 
positive employment effects were only temporary, and 
starting in the 1960s gains were completely reversed. 
As wages in manufacturing were far higher than those 
in agriculture, the shift raised aggregate income in the 
Tennessee Valley Authority region for an extended 
period.

In contrast, Becker, Egger and von Ehrlich (2010), 
who evaluated the impact of the Objective 1 scheme 
of the EU’s Structural Funds, do not find statistically 
significant positive effects on employment rates in eli-
gible areas, but they do report positive GDP per capita 
growth effects. In a follow-up study they show that the 
impact of the policy varies greatly by a region’s absorp-
tive capacity – that is, the higher a region’s human cap-
ital endowment, the more it benefits (Becker, Egger 
and von Ehrlich forthcoming).

It remains unclear to what degree these findings 
for high-income countries can be generalized to devel-
oping countries, especially as policy-makers in devel-
oping  countries  may  not  target  deprived  areas  but 
focus on efficiency. One could seek to identify market 
imperfections, which impede manufacturing activi-
ties in areas where economic development is already

7“ When subsidies are allocated to competitive 

sectors, the net impact of subsidies on total factor 
productivity becomes positive and significant

above  the  national  average  that  could  be  overcome 
with public resources. Equivalently, the conclusions 
of Criscuolo et al. (2012) – to focus on smaller firms 
– might not be applicable in low-income countries, 
because in such settings only larger firms may have 
enough absorptive capacity to benefit from such pro-
grammes. In middle-income countries the situation 
might again be different.

Design-based  studies  for  low-income  countries 
are unavailable, but Aghion et al. (2012), looking at 
China, provide a convincing argument that firm-level 
subsidies targeting production activities to a particu-
lar sector have the highest potential to spur growth if 
within-sector competition is high, and when the pol-
icy preserves this competition.

The crucial role of industrial policy is to induce 
companies to stay in high-growth sectors. The notion 
that targeting these sectors is more efficient when com-
petition is more intense within a sector and when the 
policy manages to preserve competition is supported 
by the authors’ empirical analysis (Aghion et al. 2012). 
Based on a panel dataset of large Chinese firms for 
1998–2007, the authors show that when subsidies are 
allocated to competitive sectors (or in such a way as to 
preserve competition), the net impact of subsidies on 
total factor productivity becomes positive and signifi-
cant. This suggests that subsidies to competitive sec-
tors may be a promising approach.

What can trade policy instruments contribute?
The  likely  impact  of  trade  policy  instruments  on 
growth and employment is not as clear cut as the pro-
ponents of trade liberalization and openness usually 
suggest.  First,  tailored  packages  of  complementary 
industrial  policy  instruments  comprising  different 
areas and accounting for the specific circumstances 
of each country seem necessary to benefit from trade 
liberalization (see above). Second, trade protection can 
be a promising complement for strategically chosen, 
relatively skill-intensive sectors.

On the mechanics themselves, trade policies com-
prise  all  government  actions  that  favour  domestic 
(rather than foreign) manufacturing and that promote 

exports of the domestic industry. Favouring domes-
tic manufacturing is achieved by trade protection  – 
imposing some sort of cost on the import of foreign 
goods,  typically  distinguished  between  tariffs  and 
non-tariff  barriers  to  trade  (such  as  import  quotas 
or  import  licences).  And  promoting  exports  of  the 
domestic industry can be achieved by any intervention 
that subsidizes export activity.

Export subsidies have three theoretical advantages 
over trade protection (Harrison and Rodríguez-Clare 
2010):
•  Subsidized exporting firms are subject to the dis-
cipline of the international market, which should 
force them to become more productive.

•  Subsidies to exporting firms implicitly help firms 

with a certain level of productivity.

•  The domestic market may be too small to reap the 

full benefits of externalities.
It is hard to find rigorous evidence on the impact 
of any specific trade policy, and only a single design-
based study on the impact of a specific trade policy 
could  be  identified.  But  a  vast  empirical  literature 
exists that tries to answer the underlying question of 
how trade protection (in contrast to trade liberaliza-
tion) affects economic growth and employment. Many 
studies show a strong correlation between increasing 
trade shares and country performance, while the more 
recent literature has started investigating the mecha-
nisms for gains from trade. For at least two reasons, 
though, these investigations cannot say much about 
the  actual  impact  of  trade  policies  on  growth  and 
employment:
•  The most commonly used measures of openness 
to trade are not measures of policy instruments 
themselves,  but  rather  trade  volumes  (exports 
or  imports).  Given  that  trade  volumes  are  also 
affected by many other factors such as geography 
or  exchange  rate  movements,  the  results  could 
be  misleading  (Rodriguez  and  Rodrik  2001). 
Notably, the far fewer studies that use trade poli-
cies themselves as an explanatory variable tend to 
find insignificant or weak relationships (Harrison 
and Rodríguez-Clare 2010).

7“ Any industrial policy will only work if it is 

in line with, or at least does not go against, 
the incentives of the political system

• 

Irrespective  of  the  measure  for  openness,  it  is 
extremely hard to establish causality. Is it open-
ness to trade that causes economic growth? Or do 
growing  economies  simply  become  more  open? 
And if that is not enough, many policies that lib-
eralize trade are introduced as parts of a broader 
package of policy changes, making it even harder 
to tease out their impacts.
Thus, empirical evidence on trade policy instru-
ments does not allow for a conclusion that policies 
promoting openness will spur growth and that trade 
protection  will  hamper  growth.  And  many  studies 
suggest that openness is not a sufficient condition for 
growth, but that gains from trade are contingent on 
industrial policies. Accordingly, trade policy instru-
ments should be investigated in a more detailed way in 
the future, particularly because effects are very likely 
to be heterogeneous across industries.

One design-based study on the impact of tariffs 
follows this approach and does at least partially pro-
vide  support  for  protectionist  trade  policy  instru-
ments. Nunn and Trefler (2010) point out that the 
conflicting results in the previous literature may be 
because it is conceptually wrong to look at the impact 
of a country’s average tariff. Based on a comprehensive 
empirical analysis using cross-country industry-level 
panel data, they conclude that tariffs can be effective 
in raising growth if the industries chosen for protec-
tion are skill intensive. This result is in line with the 
infant industry argument that predicts a productivity-
enhancing effect of tariff protection in the skill-inten-
sive early stages of industrial development.

Making the industrial policy process 
more effective
This  chapter  showed  earlier  that  low-  and  middle-
income  developing  countries  require  a  strategic 
approach  to  industrial  policy-making,  tailored  to 
specific  country  circumstances.  A  one-size-fits-all 
approach to economic policy has not succeeded in the 
last decades and is unlikely to bring about structural 
changes in the future. Country heterogeneity demands 
a flexible approach to policy design. So the industrial 

policy process can look very different in one country 
than in another, and industrial policy should not fol-
low a universal blueprint approach. Effective indus-
trial policy has to consider country characteristics and 
deliberately target the prevalent constraints that are 
the key obstacles to a sustained industrial growth path.

Using – not fighting – the political system
An important source of variation in the success and 
failure  of  industrial  policy  is  “political  equilibrium” 
(Robinson 2009; Evans 1995; Haggard 1990; Wade 
1990). This encapsulates the idea that the political sys-
tem determines the objectives and functioning of the 
institutions implementing the industrial policy. This 
system, which reflects the preferences of the politically 
powerful, determines through its institutions the incen-
tives of the key economic actors, influences the alloca-
tion of all public resources and decides on the distri-
bution of income (Acemoglu, Johnson and Robinson 
2005). Given such an institutional setting any industrial 
policy will only work if it is in line with, or at least does 
not go against, the incentives of the political system.

Whether the politically powerful always benefit 
from industrial promotion is not known. But to the 
extent that structural change causes a redistribution 
of income (or political power), as succinctly put by 
Robinson (2009, p. 27): “[I]t is not sufficient to just 
propose  good  economic  policies,  one  must  propose 
a way in which they will be endogenously chosen by 
those with the political power to do so”.

Strengthening political leadership
Despite the increased attention on industrialization 
in many developing countries, budgets for industrial 
support initiatives, from national treasuries or donors, 
are seldom more than negligible, bound up in the fact 
that ministries of industry are usually weak players in 
cabinet. This was not always the case.

Lall  (2004a),  arguing  persuasively  that  the  pri-
ority  given  to  industrial  policy  in  East  Asia  was 
crucial  in  turning  industry  into  the  growth  driver, 
shows that the importance of industrial policy was 
partly reflected in the power vested in the ministries

knowledge and to ensure that decisions 
are supported by key stakeholders

responsible for the sector. In Singapore, for instance, 
“the management of industrial policy and FDI target-
ing has been centralized in the powerful Economic 
Development Board (EDB). . . . EDB was endowed 
with the authority to coordinate all activities relating 
to industrial competitiveness and FDI, and given the 
resources to hire qualified and well-paid professional 
staff, [which is an essential prerequisite] to manage 
discretionary  policy  efficiently  and  honestly”  (Lall 
2004a, p. 18). Similarly, the Republic of Korea held 
“monthly meetings between top government officials 
(chaired by the President himself) and leading export-
ers” (Lall 2004a, p. 20).

In  middle-income  countries  today,  industrial 
development rarely receives such backing. Even the 
better  supported  agencies,  like  the  Department  of 
Trade and Industry in South Africa, are less involved 
in structural change than its peers in East Asia were.

In  low-income  countries  some  initiatives  at  the 
presidential level are emerging,9 but most plans are 
underfunded and donors still largely disregard this 
priority,  often  arguing  that  industrial  development 
is for the private sector and that governments should 
focus on infrastructure or training programmes.

These views seem misguided. Political leadership 
at the top is crucial for raising the profile of indus-
trial  policies  and  for  ensuring  the  required  coordi-
nation,  oversight  and  monitoring  (Rodrik  2004). 
Inter-ministerial competition for resources and policy 
incoherence can only be prevented by strategic leader-
ship at the highest levels. It is also essential for high-
ranking  government  officials  to  be  responsible  for 
industrial policy so they can be held accountable if 
these policies fail. In the 1970s the president of the 
Republic of Korea himself took the lead role in cham-
pioning the country’s industrial policies and strategies. 
Such ownership is imperative. And beyond that, dia-
logue with the private sector can create further incen-
tives for the political class to act.

Encouraging public–private dialogue
Governments should join forces with their industrial 
private sector to design interventions based on their 

combined expert knowledge and to ensure that deci-
sions are supported by key stakeholders.

Such  dialogue  between  government  and  private 
sectors – defined as any interaction between the state 
and the private sector relating to the design of public 
policies – is a key policy process in countries that have 
achieved economic growth through structural change 
(Altenburg  2010;  UNIDO  and  UNCTAD  2011). 
In developing countries with low public sector capac-
ity, private sector input can make a real contribution 
to successful policies (Altenburg 2010). Even so, rent 
seeking is an inherent risk in public–private dialogue 
and  governance  mechanisms  are  needed  to  avoid  a 
policy outcome narrowly focused on the interests of 
certain groups (te Velde and Leftwich 2010).

For  that  reason  a  participatory  and  consensual 
decision-making mechanism is one of the key deter-
minants of an effective industrial policy process. It is 
easy to agree that a new industrial policy cannot be a 
top-down planning process and needs to be based on 
such dialogue, but in practical terms at the very least 
a clear structure to ensure close private sector involve-
ment is needed.

Easier said than done, however. Fruitful dialogue 
requires private sector organizations that allow com-
panies to articulate their needs and give input to the 
policy process, yet in low-income countries produc-
ers  in  chambers  of  commerce  and  industry  may  be 
overshadowed by trading companies. As retailers and 
wholesalers can have fairly different policy concerns 
from manufacturers (on tariffs, import quotas and so 
forth),  governments  should  consider  strengthening 
manufacturers’ representation in national chambers.

The unorganized private sector may even need to 
strengthen  the  manufacturers’  (or  subsector’s)  asso-
ciation, or possibly create it. Most support programmes 
for  private  sector  associations  focus  on  increasing 
membership or enhancing technical services to constit-
uents, but frequently disregard their capacity to lobby 
for member firms’ interests. Thus a more consensual 
and effective industrial policy process often requires 
targeted institutional-strengthening measures for pol-
icy management capabilities of these associations.

7“ Umbrella organizations can help ensure 

broad participation of different private sector 
segments without overburdening the dialogue

Another point is how to institutionalize mecha-
nisms for public–private dialogue so as to make them 
sustainable. They can exist either temporarily, such as 
the informal “growth alliances” of public and private 
representatives in different industries in Egypt (Abdel-
Latif and Schmitz 2010), or be sustained over longer 
periods, such as the National Economic Development 
and Labour Council in South Africa.

Developing  country  governments  may  want  to 
consult a range of successful cases of effective partici-
patory approaches in other countries to decide on the 
most  appropriate  institutional  set-up,  which  could 
include  a  centralized  government  agency  for  pub-
lic–private dialogue, a focal point for private sector 
engagement or regular forums.

While the aim of this dialogue is to secure broad 
political commitment, success can be held back by a 
suboptimal trade-off between the broadest possible 
participation and flexible decision-making. Umbrella 
organizations can help ensure broad participation of 
different private sector segments without overburden-
ing the dialogue, but the internal governance struc-
tures  must  be  made  representative  of  industry  as  a 
whole. This point is particularly relevant for SMEs, 
which need to join forces to make their voices heard 
(Pinaud 2007). Whether and how much trade unions 
and civil society bodies should be represented depends 
on the scope of deliberations.

A country’s industrial policy is usually formed 
at  the  national  level,  but  dialogue  should  ideally 
take place at various levels of government – from 
national  through  regional  to  local  –  to  capitalize 
on companies’ and entrepreneurs’ local knowledge. 
This  approach  would  require  private  associations 
organized at different levels as well as correspond-
ing  institutional  structures  for  the  dialogue.  This 
risks overburdening the process, particularly in the 
early  phase,  but  some  degree  of  inclusion  of  local 
actors is prerequisite for serious buy-in, and it can 
be achieved without far-reaching institutional rear-
rangements, as with the help of subnational indus-
trial policy forums, which allow firms to air their 
concerns.

Boosting industrial policy management 
capabilities
Beyond making the above political and other adjust-
ments, countries need to have a certain technocratic 
capacity to realize the vision of, say, the president or 
prime minister, for industrial policy to succeed. Many 
developing countries lack this capacity, which has to 
be built pragmatically.

Capacity gaps inhibiting industrial policy
Altenburg (2011, p. 3), who coined the term “indus-
trial policy management capabilities”, highlights that 
“the key problem of industrial policy in poor develop-
ing countries is that, while the need to correct market 
failures is much greater than it is in highly developed 
societies, the ability of the public sector to tackle such 
failures is also much more limited”.

So the question runs: What are these capacities 
and how can they be built? Effective industrial policy-
making requires adequate capacities for each step of 
the policy cycle (Box 7.3). Strong analytical capacities 
are needed to thoroughly diagnose industrial perfor-
mance,  constraints  and  potential.  Decision-making 
capacities are needed for the smart design of strategic 
directions, and the industrial policy toolbox needs to 
be understood to propose adequate policy interven-
tions. Implementation requires strong management 
as well as technical and sectoral competencies. And 
forward-looking monitoring and evaluation requires 
not only adequate financial resources but also techni-
cal expertise.

Altenburg (2011) argues that most low- and lower 
middle-income  countries  perform  very  weakly  in 
four key dimensions: defining priorities and building 
a broad consensus; establishing clear rules for mar-
ket-based competition transparently and efficiently; 
delivering services effectively; and avoiding political 
capture.

The causes of the capability challenge are from 
home  and  abroad.  Domestically,  weak  education 
and  training  systems  fail  to  provide  enough  well-
prepared bureaucrats, and neo-patrimonial political 
systems go right down most technocratic structures

Box 7.3 
The policy cycle

the phases of the industrial policy process can be charac-
terized as a cycle that starts with the diagnosis and design 
of the policy, and then implementation, followed by moni-
toring and evaluation – which closes one cycle and starts 
the next.

change. thus, a longer term component for new productive 
capabilities must be the ultimate goal (unIdo and unCtad 
2011). the idea of “defying” comparative advantage to cre-
ate the foundations for future gains is at the core of this leap-
frogging approach (lin and Chang 2009).

the  initial  phase  entails  thoroughly  evaluating  the 
country’s industrial capacity, its structure and its competi-
tive performance – an industrial diagnosis. It should also 
cover endowment structures, country and population size, 
and so on.

the design, building on this diagnosis, prioritizes the 
key objectives of the envisaged growth path and proposes 
measures to accomplish them. the policy may have dif-
ferent  objectives  but  should  identify  and  acknowledge 
trade-offs. achieving industrial growth the fastest will no 
doubt require different choices from securing employment 
creation or equitable regional development. In addition, 
industrial policies have to identify and prioritize immediate 
and future potential and solutions.

a short-term component that aims at easy gains or “low-
hanging fruit” – as through upgrading a sector or increasing 
value addition to a traditional commodity – is highly impor-
tant for a realistic process, though any pragmatic short-term 
focus must still show the pathway for full-fledged structural 

Industrial  policy  interventions  for  structural  change 
have to be ambitious by definition, though they can only be 
effective if they are realistic not only over time and scope, 
but also on the current capabilities of firms and the labour 
force and on financial resources for implementation. Gov-
ernments of low-income countries have to take strategic 
bets into consideration, deliberating on the right ambitions.
once the policy is designed and agreed among stake-
holders, policy instruments have to be chosen (see Indus-
trial policy instruments – four main categories, above). the 
implementation process of these instruments varies con-
siderably, posing very different challenges among devel-
oping countries.

a key feature of the cycle is the feedback loop from 
implementation  to  diagnosis,  based  on  monitoring  and 
evaluation. this  identifies  success  and  failure  to  be  fed 
into the next cycle, enabling adaptation and better perfor-
mance (unIdo and unCtad 2011).

and sometimes discourage even the most motivated 
and well-educated staff involved in industrial policy. 
Internationally,  some  donors  have  reduced  policy 
space  or  even  undermined  industrial  policy  meas-
ures in the last few decades in various ways, includ-
ing by facilitating poverty reduction strategy papers 
that  were  biased  towards  social  sectors;  imposing 
economic policies that do not align with industrial 
policy  objectives;  enforcing  deregulation  that  has 
weakened technocratic structures; replacing senior 
national  decision-makers  with  international  advi-
sors;  reducing  the  competitiveness  of  productive 
sectors through large aid inflows; actively attracting 
the most capable and entrepreneurial workforce into 
aid institutions; allowing donor fragmentation and 
non-alignment with national strategies; and replac-
ing  existing  institutional  structures  and  mandates 
with  new  implementation  units  (Altenburg  2011; 
Olukoshi 2004).

One cannot argue that industrial policy initiatives 
would have succeeded in low-income countries with-
out donor involvement, but some egregious examples 
of the above issues stand out:
•  The  set-up  by  an  international  organization  of 
a  project  for  competitiveness  and  private  sector 
development in Mozambique, which exceeded the 
total budget of the national Ministry of Industry 
and  Trade,  was  designed  with  little  national 
involvement, appropriated senior personnel from 
the ministry and essentially operated as a parallel 
agency (Krause and Kaufmann 2012).

•  The simultaneous activities of 10 different donor 
agencies on value chain development in Ethiopia 
in the 2000s, which all used differing methodolo-
gies and cooperated seldom cooperated with each 
other (Altenburg 2011).

•  The  regular  posting  of  long-term  senior  inter-
national  experts  into  ministries  of  industry  in 

147

7“ The pragmatic idea is to concentrate 

the available resources on executing highest 
priority tasks, and to incrementally build 
additional skills when they are really needed

Sub-Saharan  Africa,  who  largely  replaced  the 
national design of industrial strategies and policies 
without much interaction with local actors.
This capability challenge is more severe in the indus-
trial policy arena than others because the more central-
ized government agencies usually also succeed in secur-
ing the best talent. Particularly in many Sub-Saharan 
countries, ministries of finance, planning commissions, 
development banks and other key players in cabinet are 
best placed to secure government resources.

Building management capabilities, 
ideally through learning by doing
During the Washington Consensus period, the World 
Bank  (1997)  stated  that  industrial  policy  was  very 
difficult and required particularly high policy skills 
compared with other policy areas. Suggesting that the 
state’s role should be aligned with its capabilities, it felt 
that low-income countries should not engage in this 
area but rather build their institutional capabilities 
beforehand. Lall (2004b), too, made the point that the 
strategic choice for an industrial policy in a country 
should ideally be based on an understanding of gov-
ernment capabilities – suggesting that simpler policies 
are the preferable option in less sophisticated adminis-
trations. But he also highlighted that capabilities can 
be built over time.

Criticizing  the  approach  of  policy-capability 
matching more fundamentally, Ohno (2009) makes 
the point that institutions and capabilities of techno-
crats in low-income countries cannot be enhanced in 
a general way, as this is neither politically appealing 
nor  administratively  implementable.  Instead,  capa-
bilities should be strengthened in a more concentrated 
way, through dynamic capacity development. Citing 
the East Asian experiences, he suggests that the pol-
icy  capabilities  in  developing  countries  can  best  be 
enhanced through hands-on efforts towards concrete 
goals. The pragmatic idea is to concentrate the avail-
able resources on executing highest priority tasks, and 
to incrementally build additional skills when they are 
really needed so as to solve emerging problems when 
they arise.

This  debate  cannot  easily  be  settled  without 
recourse to country cases, but it is clear that, as any eco-
nomic or social decision with future impact, industrial 
policy-making is subject to fundamental uncertainty. 
This means that even the most capable administration 
will be unable to anticipate either the future develop-
ment of its country, the dynamics of a certain sector 
or the competitive behaviour of competing countries. 
Equally, even the most sophistically designed policy 
intervention based on thorough analysis and imple-
mented efficiently will not necessarily lead to success. 
Industrial policy may certainly be more risky in low-
capability contexts, but may fail anywhere.

Industrial  policy  should  thus  be  seen  as 
experimentation   –  essentially  learning  by  doing 
(see  next  subsection).  Accordingly,  the  question  of 
whether industrial policy is possible or not with the 
given capabilities should be replaced with: “How can 
the experimentation and policy-learning process be 
structured to fit the country context?” This process 
should not be held back because of concerns about 
failure, but interventions should rather be scaled up 
slowly  from  low-risk,  low-complexity  interventions 
to  more  ambitious  initiatives.  To  quote  Altenburg 
(2011, p. 36) again: “[T]here is a special need for poli-
cies that are cheap [and] simple in their implemen-
tation, and cannot easily be captured by influential 
interest groups”.

Flexible policy design: experimenting, 
learning and evaluating

Gone is the confidence that we have the correct 
recipe, or that privatization, stabilization and 
liberalization can be implemented in similar 
ways in different parts of the world. Reform 
discussions focus on the need to get away from 
“one-size-fits-all” strategies and on context-spe-
cific solutions. The emphasis is on the need for 
humility, for policy diversity, for selective and 
modest reforms and for experimentation. . . . 
Policy design . . . relies less on “best practices” 
and more on a combination of experimenta-
tion and monitoring (Rodrik 2008b).

7“ Industrial policy-makers in developing 

countries would be well advised to gradually shift 
their attention from investigating and imitating 
international best practices to identifying 
and reproducing national success stories

This chapter has made the point that industrial 
policy-makers who need to choose suitable industrial 
policy instruments cannot simply follow deterministic 
planning. While there is plenty to learn from theory 
and practice, and from benchmarking across coun-
tries, it is just not possible to generalize findings from 
one situation to another. Rather than simply emulat-
ing  industrial  policies  that  have  worked  elsewhere, 
countries have to go through their own learning pro-
cess.  This  process  necessarily  involves  experimenta-
tion, and trial and error. Abhijit Banerjee, one of the 
leading proponents of this school of thought, empha-
sizes that “what is probably the best argument for the 
experimental approach [is that] it spurs innovation 
by making it easy to see what works” (Banerjee 2007, 
p. 122).

For this approach to work, however, industrial pol-
icy experimentation has to be combined with rigorous 
impact evaluation of each implemented instrument 
to generate the evidence on which industrial policy 
measures work (and which do not) in a given context. 
Probably the most important role of industrial policy 
monitoring and evaluation in developing countries is 
to provide feedback for making the next cycle more 
innovative and effective.

Industrial policy-makers in developing countries 
would be well advised to gradually shift their atten-
tion from investigating and imitating international 
best practices to identifying and reproducing national 
success stories. In principle this leads us to the recom-
mendation that every industrial policy intervention 
should be evaluated retrospectively. Especially in con-
texts with serious budget limitations and thus prior-
itization, it is essential to know whether the policy 
intervention was effective and whether the resulting 
benefits outweighed the associated public costs. But 
while this approach is finding more support among 
academics and in the donor community, policy practi-
tioners encounter at least two political challenges:
•  Evaluations, particularly the more sophisticated 
ones  that  include  design-based  studies,  do  not 
come  free,  thus  reducing  the  available  budgets 
for implementing policy. So small interventions 

especially do not readily lend themselves to com-
prehensive monitoring and evaluation approaches.
•  Evaluations can reveal inherent flaws, limitations 
and even adverse consequences of industrial policy 
interventions. In almost all cases this implies a seri-
ous political cost. So full-fledged evaluations are 
frequently perceived as a threat, particularly larger 
interventions that usually coincide with ambitious 
political rhetoric and wide-ranging public interest.
Both  these  concerns  could  possibly  be  resolved 
though, at least partially, with a more nuanced and 
pragmatic approach to industrial policy experimenta-
tion and evaluation. While full-fledged design-based 
studies and experimental designs are not always feasi-
ble, their distinctive logic should at least be incorpo-
rated in the industrial policy decision-making, even if 
a final evaluation cannot. The point is that there are 
possibilities to design policy instruments as if they 
were experiments, without actually executing them as 
such. Policy interventions should come with a clearly 
formulated and realistic intervention logic or theory of 
change. At the very least, this approach would entail:
•  A clear definition of a target system that makes 
concrete  the  objectives  (including  trade-offs 
among different objectives) that the policy instru-
ment is aiming to have an impact on in the longer 
term (increased employment or economic growth, 
for example).

•  Realistic “target corridors” for judging success or 
failure with regard to each objective ideally based 
on  real-world  benchmarks  (such  as  minimum 
and maximum expected increase in employment, 
based  on  prior  achievements  in  the  country  or 
elsewhere).

•  An explicit impact model with a comprehensive 
depiction of the short- and medium-term changes 
in industrial sectors (at the firm and sector levels) 
that are needed to reach these long-term targets 
(such as required investments of manufacturing 
firms  and  structural  changes  in  the  production 
activities of firms).

•  A  detailed  description  of  the  steps  required  for 
reaching  each  of  these  goals  (impact  paths),

7“ This process does at least ensure that 

interventions are discussed and designed 
reflexively and that stakeholders are well aware of 
the actions and achievements expected of them

including a critical examination of whether it is 
realistic to expect to reach the goal with the time 
and resources available.

•  An account of possible unintended impacts and 
side-effects of the policy instrument (risk factors), 
based, say, on consultations of experts and affected 
stakeholders before the intervention is carried out.
•  An honest description of the assumed counterfac-
tual, for instance: “What would the employment 
rate have been if the government had not subsi-
dized manufacturing wages?”

•  The selection of concrete impact indicators, which 
can be used to measure change both “on the way” 
(intermediate indicators) and with regard to the 
end objective (final indicators).
This  process  does  not  guarantee  retrospective 
scientific evidence on the causal effect of the policy 
instrument, which is unquestionably an evaluation’s 
main objective for the academic and donor commu-
nities. But it does at least ensure that interventions 
are discussed and designed reflexively and that stake-
holders are well aware of the actions and achievements 
expected of them.

If this process is combined with less sophisticated 
and  less  costly  (non-experimental)  monitoring  and 
evaluation designs, such as reflexive comparisons and 
qualitative research, industrial policy interventions are 
likely to be much more evidence based, consensual and 
transparent – and (it is hoped) more effective, without 
overburdening the technical and budgetary capacities 
of developing countries.

rency) compared with the domestic market with a 
given amount of local currency.
In the ideal case, to obtain an unbiased estimate 
of a true causal effect of a policy measure, it is 
essential to execute a thorough design-based study 
that considers confounding factors, including a 
control group, and that avoids selection biases as 
well as under- and overestimation of results. A 
detailed  technical  description  of  impact  evalu-
ation methodologies goes well beyond the scope 
of this chapter, but Gertler et al. (2011) provide 
a comprehensive overview from a practitioner’s 
perspective. Impact evaluations can be costly and 
time consuming, and thus hard to combine with 
an industrial policy process that often puts more 
emphasis on short-term objectives and quick wins 
than on systemic transformation.

size is quite intuitive, as larger firms are less likely

Education and training policies for 
creating jobs in manufacturing

Employment creation is at the core of industrial strate-
gies geared to sustainable development. There seems to 
be consensus that to maximize the benefits of indus-
trialization, labour markets have to generate more and 
better jobs, which in turn increase real incomes and 
take people out of poverty.

The formation of specialized technical skills plays a 
major role in the quantity and quality of employment 
generation,  and  the  accelerating  pace  of  technologi-
cal change is making these skills more important. And 
as the skills required for modern manufacturing have 
changed, so too have the institutional structures provid-
ing them. In the past, employability was correlated with 
improvements in basic education. Today’s more competi-
tive world puts greater emphasis on specialized high-level 
training, not only through formal training systems but 
mainly from the close interaction between the industrial 
private sector and the education apparatus.

Technological change and increased pressures to com-
pete have put a premium on top skills in science, engineer-
ing, mathematics, computing and information technol-
ogy. The most advanced countries in Asia, for example, 
give incentives to students to enrol in scientific subjects 
at university and offer early access to vocational training.

General considerations for skill policies
Most governments agree that human capital is a cru-
cial driver for economic growth. Yet many, particu-
larly in the developing world, have failed to act on this 
belief, partly because of their inability to push through 
the right policies and partly because of the private sec-
tor’s unwillingness to get involved in creating skills. 
Some guiding principles based on good practice can 
help policy-makers understand the elements that go 
into successful skill policies.

demand,  and  education  and  training  methods,  but 
they need to make thorough assessments of skill gaps 
to identify industry’s specific needs.

Matching short-term needs and long-term 
goals
Policy-makers have to create or strengthen skills for 
industry today while anticipating demand for tomor-
row, especially in countries that want to transform 
their  economies.  They  may  need  to  consider  three 
types of intervention: “early reactive” to tackle imme-
diate skill shortages; “continuing” to tackle the skill 
demand for upgrading within existing industries; and 
“future-oriented” to supply the skills for long-term 
structural  change  (Fernandez-Stark,  Bamber  and 
Gereffi 2012). Early reactive can be addressed quickly 
through on-the-job training, but future-oriented may 
call for long-term changes to education. Still, policies 
have to be realistic, and changes should be gradual 
and  sequential  to  forestall  possibly  huge  misuse  of 
resources on a system that does not meet industry’s 
demands.

The formal education system needs to adjust over 
time.  Other  forms  of  training  by  private  and  pub-
lic suppliers should fill in the gaps, and firms have to 
adopt a “skill culture” through innovation and learn-
ing.  This  will  not  happen  automatically,  hence  the 
need for policy intervention.

Specialized  technical  skills  need  to  be  built  on 
strong  education  foundations  set  during  primary 
and secondary school, primarily comprising the fun-
damental academic skills of numeracy and literacy, 
as well as behavioural (or soft) skills acquired at an 
early age through personal interactions and problem 
solving.

Understanding the complexity of industrial 
skill needs
A  simplified  matrix  (see  Table  4.4  in  Chapter  4) 
can help policy-makers identify broad skill profiles, 

Matching supply and demand
As discussed in Chapter 4 (see Mismatch between 
skill  demand  and  supply),  successful  skill  policies 
have to bridge the gaps of over-supply in some areas

“ The education system will need to

of  knowledge  and  of  offering  too  many  diplomas 
in  non-required  fields.  Reconciling  the  “what  is 
needed” with the “what can be provided and how” 
is possibly the most important challenge in design-
ing skill policies, yet the interplay between supply 
and demand is complex. The supply side essentially 
reacts to signals from the demand side, but the tim-
ing of demand and the lack of innovation strategies 
may hamper the speed and nature of the response by 
education and training organizations. Without hav-
ing a complex planning system, the education sys-
tem will need to develop the capacity to anticipate 
upcoming demand – and work towards providing 
the upcoming areas of expertise despite facing major 
uncertainty as to whether these actually will be the 
needed fields, if it is going to provide the required 
workforce  for  structural  change  and  economic 
growth.

Aligning skill policies with the broader 
socioeconomic agenda
Skill policies have to be aligned with the economic 
and  social  development  needs  of  society,  which 
requires  strong  coordination  between  stakehold-
ers engaged in policy-making – public and private. 
Policy-makers have to be aware that the skill policies 
may differ greatly depending on a country’s industri-
alization starting point and goal – the challenges for 
a resource-rich unindustrialized country differ greatly 
from those for a country trying to escape the middle-
income trap.

Many  developing  countries  suffer  from  coordi-
nation failures when designing skill policies, for two 
main reasons. First, the government agency developing 
the economic agenda is not necessarily the one respon-
sible  for  executing  it.  The  lack  of  inter-ministerial 
coordination often results in the design of industrial 
policies that are unrealistic for the country’s human 
resources.  Second,  the  private  sector  in  developing 
countries, even if organized, is minimally involved in 
policy-making, which again leads to misconceptions 
of industry’s skill needs. Thus skill policies become 
supply driven.

Policy recommendations for skills
As countries differ in many ways, so does the choice 
of skill policies. There is no one-fits-all policy mix that 
works for all countries. Policies that worked in Asia 
many years ago, for example, may not work in Africa 
today. The knowledge structure of a country is deter-
mined by multiple factors, including formal school-
ing, in-firm learning and the knowledge acquired and 
influenced  by  social  networks  such  as  families  and 
communities (Nübler 2013b). The sociocultural and 
historical context plays a fundamental role that can 
lead to failure of policies that have worked elsewhere, 
so policy-makers should be cautious when designing 
skill policies. Still, they may wish to consider a few 
broad thrusts and some other countries’ approaches.

Support development of soft transferable 
skills for manufacturing
In Viet Nam manufacturing employers are not just 
looking  for  technical  skills  but  also  for  cognitive, 
social  and  behavioural  skills.  Teamwork  and  prob-
lem-solving skills are considered key for blue-collar 
workers,  while  critical  thinking  comes  out  as  the 
most desired skill for white-collar workers (Bodewig 
2012).  Mastering  English  is  a  top  priority  in  Thai 
manufacturing (World Bank 2010). These are just two 
examples of how important soft skills have become in 
South-East Asian manufacturing.

Indeed,  with  the  growing  pace  of  technological 
change in manufacturing, and the shift from routine 
manual to more non-routine analytical and interactive 
activities, companies now put a premium on a work-
force better prepared to learn and absorb new tasks. 
Problem-solving attitudes as well as interpersonal skills 
such as communication and teamwork have become 
crucial for on-the-job learning, to the extent that some 
firms have now prioritized these over other technical 
education when hiring staff due to the transferability 
of  skills  across  sectors  (EC  2011;  Fernandez-Stark, 
Bamber and Gereffi 2012; Murnane and Levy 1996).

While specialized technical skills remain key for 
structural  change  and  technological  upgrading  in 
manufacturing, soft transferable skills have become

8“ The emphasis should be on critical 

thinking, problem solving and the 
encouragement of teamwork and creativity

a crucial asset for employability, both in and outside 
manufacturing.1 Many of these soft skills have to be 
developed at an early age, signifying the importance of 
supporting policies that establish the learning founda-
tions of the future workforce. More and better school-
ing will be crucial for manufacturing, and develop-
ing soft transferable skills will enhance employment 
prospects later on. The non-technical nature of these 
skills also calls for changes in the teaching approach. 
Traditional “follow the model” methods that empha-
sized static learning, memorization and imitation are 
no longer viable for developing interpersonal skills. 
The emphasis should be on critical thinking, problem 
solving and the encouragement of teamwork and crea-
tivity. The combination of these skills and specialized 
technical  skills  acquired  later  will  provide  the  best 
possible skill mix for employment in highly advanced 
manufacturing.

Complement formal education with technical 
and vocational education and training
Over  the  last  few  decades  there  has  been  a  strong 
emphasis on technical and vocational education and 
training (TVET) to meet the demand for industrial 
skills. No substitute for formal education – instead, 
TVET  builds  on  it  to  deliver  specialized  technical 
training. Although TVET covers the whole gamut of 
manufacturing skills, the shift from simple assembly 
and processing to technology-intensive industries calls 
for a skilled workforce capable of operating state-of-
the-art technologies. Tertiary enrolment in technical 
subjects, including engineering and mathematics, has 
normally been taken as a useful indicator for the avail-
ability of skilled labour for highly advanced industry.
But university education has often proved to be 
insufficient supplying the skills needed by industry 
both because of the rigidity of university curricula in 
times where the demand for skills in industry is con-
stantly changing and because of a lack of private sec-
tor participation in developing those curricula. There 
seems to be a consensus that TVET is usually more 
adaptable to industrial needs as the private sector is 
often engaged in its design and even execution.2

TVET  does  not  work  automatically.  In  many 
instances  the  suppliers  of  TVET  were  unable  to 
keep up with the skill needs of industry due to sud-
den  changes  in  demand.  If  the  private  sector  does 
not  provide  the  information  continually,  it  is  very 
unlikely that TVET suppliers can anticipate changes 
in  demand  and  so  adjust  the  training  curriculum. 
Governments  at  times  assume  incorrectly  to  have 
more and better information than private parties on 
programmes. Finally, TVET can also fail due to enrol-
ment shortages as families in developing countries may 
not be aware of the longer terms benefits of a technical 
education (Almeida, Behrman and Robalino 2012).

For TVET to be mainstreamed within the edu-
cation system in developing countries – and in many 
developed ones – TVET programmes have to over-
come three main challenges:
•  They still do not enjoy a good reputation among 
the general public, which sees TVET as an alterna-
tive for those who do not perform well at school, 
rather than as a mechanism that enhances future 
employability through the acquisition of industrial 
skills.

•  A variety of public and private bodies offer them, 
frequently leading to many uncoordinated efforts 
and  myriad  certifications  that  can  confuse  pro-
spective students and employers. Most countries 
lack a single body responsible for setting standards 
for TVET programmes, not only for their design 
but also for execution and monitoring.

•  Programmes rarely have tracking systems to con-
firm  whether  participants  have  found  jobs  in 
related  fields,  giving  the  institutions  little  feed-
back on their courses’ relevance and suitability for 
graduates.

Engage the private sector in designing 
technical and vocational education 
and training
The involvement of the private sector in TVET is cru-
cial for its success because its involvement is the most 
efficient way to link skills to the labour market (DFID 
2011).  The  private  sector  is  not  only  important  by

8“ On-the-job enterprise training is 

possibly one of the most important sources 
of skill development in manufacturing

providing relevant information on skill needs but also 
by taking an active role in shaping the training pro-
grammes to make sure they match skill demands more 
closely (Box 8.1).

Where  the  private  sector  is  less  strong,  there  is 
still the possibility to develop successful TVET pro-
grammes  by  involving  relevant  stakeholders.  For 
instance, in India the Skills Development Initiative, 
which aims to provide 1 million workers with employ-
able  skills  over  five  years  with  an  additional  mil-
lion workers each year after that, is a public–private 
partnership.

Encourage on-the-job training
On-the-job enterprise training is possibly one of the 
most important sources of skill development in manu-
facturing. Training in enterprises, usually provided 
to employees after formal education and vocational 
training,  is  a  very  effective  and  economical  way  to 
develop the workforce’s industrial skills. The reason 
is  that  manufacturing  firms  bear  the  cost  of  train-
ing only to the extent that they expect to reap some 
benefits. Such training can take different forms. At 
the lower end of the spectrum formal training is rare 

and only occurs through informal exchanges with col-
leagues. In highly advanced sectors training is formal-
ized, becoming an integral part of the worker’s job.3

Apprenticeship schemes have become increasingly 
popular as an efficient public–private partnership to 
bring industrial skills to the shop floor (Box 8.2). They 
are not only responsible for developing skills that are 
very specific to individual firms and sectors, but are 
thought to be a key reasons for low youth unemploy-
ment  –  as  in  Austria,  Germany  and  Switzerland, 
which have successful dual-training systems. 

In all countries considering this system the private 
sector needs to have a key role in designing the train-
ing, to ensure that the skills required are being learned 
(AU 2007). Economies relying on a large agricultural 
sector and with a large informal sector may not find 
the dual system suitable, however, as it needs a strong 
private sector and a high level of institutional coordi-
nation among the parties.

Make financing for training efficient and 
equitable
Lack of financing is the main constraint to supplying 
high-quality TVET. Governments cannot be expected 

Box 8.1 
Involving the private sector in Singapore

singapore’s vocational and technical education (vte) is 
frequently  cited  as  among  the  most  effective  in  having 
achieved a transformation from an unskilled workforce to 
a highly skilled one, in 20 years (lai and yap 2004; lall 
2001).

vte seems to differentiate itself from those in neigh-
bouring economies in one aspect – a private sector role in 
the coordinating body (lai and yap 2004). although in the 
republic of Korea, Malaysia and taiwan Province of China 
the government is either the principal or only body mak-
ing decisions on vocational education, the government of 
singapore has ensured that the private sector has a key 
role in shaping vte, and representatives of industry and 
labour organizations form a significant part of the coor-
dinating body. this representation allows for a direct and 
continual flow of information on changes in the demand 
for skills in industry, and teaching curricula can thus be 
adapted quickly.

additionally,  the  system  offers  traineeship  pro-
grammes with key industries such as aircraft maintenance 
and  ship  manufacturing. agreements  have  been  signed 
with  industry  for  technology  and  knowledge  transfer 
between education centres and industry, to ensure that 
teachers remain up to date with industry developments 
(law 2007).

the government-funded Institute of technical educa-
tion  – singapore’s  pride  in vte  –  has  become  a  world-
class  institution,  known  for  its  quality,  values  and  rele-
vance internationally. over the years it has changed from 
comprising various vocational institutes to three “educa-
tional colleges”. with strong industry partnership, 70 per-
cent of the curriculum consisting of practical work and a 
wide range of programmes and courses for students, the 
Institute strongly emphasizes the suitability of its gradu-
ates for future employment (law 2007).

scheme, ideally under one body, avoids 
duplication and informs sectors about 
the qualifications held by individuals

Box 8.2 
Apprenticeship schemes

apprenticeship schemes combine classroom vocational 
training  with  practical  work  experience  in  the  firm.  the 
strong link with the private sector enables the curriculum 
to  adapt  rapidly  to  changing  demands  in  industry.  the 
government  offers  the  classroom  courses,  and  the  firm 
pays a reduced salary to the participant. after the contract 
between the participant and the employer for this work 
experience expires, the employer can hire the participant 
(or choose not to).

young  people  in  the  scheme  have  a  smoother  and 
faster  transition  from  education  to  their  first  job,  which 
may  be  very  important  in  ensuring  that  they  are  not 

discouraged at the start of their career, especially as par-
ticipants are more likely to be those with lower educational 
attainment at an earlier stage (Biavaschi et al. 2012).

the best-known example of a dual-training system is 
in Germany. It is complex, having developed over many 
years. adequate organizational capacity is required, as is 
participation and collaboration of trade unions, the gov-
ernment  (including  for  regulatory  frameworks),  employ-
ers and others. Particularly for employers, such in-house 
training can be costly, making it crucial for the advantages 
of such a scheme to be well communicated.

to meet the whole burden when private returns surpass 
social returns. Yet firms, even aware of the benefits of 
training, may be unable to bear the associated costs 
and risks. This is particularly true for smaller firms in 
developing countries.

Governments have to make financing efficient and 
equitable, and the best way to do this is by partner-
ing with the private sector. Indirect financing – the 
state co-finances training schemes but the private sec-
tor takes responsibility for delivering services – has 
proved successful. The policy is based on the expected 
efficiency and equity gains economy-wide, especially 
for manufacturing firms that require a pool of highly 
skilled  professionals.  Two  approaches  have  become 
increasingly popular for such co-financing (Box 8.3).

Develop nationwide certification for 
manufacturing skills
A large number of uncoordinated efforts to build indus-
trial skills results in duplicity, waste of resources and 
confusion among employers and prospective students. 
A  unified  nationwide  certification  scheme,  ideally 
under one body, avoids duplication and informs sectors 
about the qualifications held by individuals. For these 
people such a certificate signals to potential employers 
the types of skills they have, which can be particularly 
advantageous for youth who do not have experience or 
personal contacts, and thus face difficulties in present-
ing themselves to potential employers. For a firm it is 

a form of quality assurance and allows them to meas-
ure and compare skills among applicants (World Bank 
2010). Certification also facilitates labour mobility and 
creates competition within the labour market.

Support skill development through 
inter-firm linkages
It is important to look beyond traditional forms of 
providing training and education. With globalization, 
the dynamics of manufacturing have changed dramat-
ically. As production becomes more fragmented and 
the need to increase efficiency to remain competitive 
internationally grows, firms have found new ways to 
position themselves.

International  trade  has  changed  production 
networks  (see  Chapter  5),  including  skill  creation, 
manufacturing clusters (Box 8.4) and huge scope for 
knowledge spillovers. Some governments have reacted 
by  encouraging  growth  through  training  centres, 
research and development (R&D) institutes and sci-
ence parks. These routes allow for knowledge to flow 
much faster, especially across borders.

Governments need to do more to facilitate such 
knowledge  exchange.  (The  national  and  regional 
authorities  were  key  in  developing  training  and 
R&D centres in the clusters in Box 8.4.) Being part 
of a global production network can allow a firm and 
its employees to develop the skills for manufacturing 
employment. Often, lead firms in more economically

to better suit industry’s needs for higher 
skills, a variety of similar policies need to 
be put in place, like those proposed for 
general education and TVET systems

Box 8.3 
Targeted voucher programmes and levy schemes

Targeted voucher programmes
targeted  voucher  programmes  have  traditionally  been 
used to make education more equitable by targeting under-
served groups like women and youth. vouchers for low-
income students can be given for them to get the education 
of their choice. the same principle applies to out-of-school 
training, similar to vocational training delivered by the pri-
vate sector. this can lead to more efficiency as vocational 
training schools depend on revenue from students’ fees.

Levy schemes
a  national  training  fund  is  typically  used  to  finance 
employee training inside or outside the enterprise. Financ-
ing is usually secured through payroll-training levies. such 
funds are becoming an increasingly common engine for 
financing in-firm training and for many countries – often 
in latin america and africa – they constitute the embryo 
of their emerging educational systems for lifelong learning 
(Johanson 2009; unni 2011).

the scattered evidence suggests that these schemes 
have  helped  increase  training.  In  Malaysia  employer- 
participants of the human resource d evelopment Fund 
levy were more likely than non-participants to have trained 

their employees (tan and Gill 1998). In singapore, through 
the skills development  Fund,  the  amount  of  training  by 
employers increased (Kuruvilla and Chua 1999; tzannatos 
and  Johnes  1997; dar,  Canagarajah  and  Murphy  2003). 
“a  common  feature  of  schemes,  in  which  training  has 
increased, has been the fact that an effective system is 
in place for administering the levy” (dar, Canagarajah and 
Murphy 2003, p. 7).

one of the main criticisms is that the scheme is far from 
equitable as larger firms tend to benefit more than smaller 
ones. smaller firms thus see this scheme more as a tax 
burden, and larger companies more as a subsidy, partly 
because  higher  educated  workers  are  more  likely  than 
those with less education to receive training (oeCd 1999).

In developing countries levy schemes are particularly 
difficult to implement well because they rely on effective 
tax  collection.  “the  high  rates  of  non-compliance  are 
related to the low administrative capacity of governments 
and  ineffective  levy-collection  mechanisms  that  cannot 
target smaller employers” (dar, Canagarajah and Murphy 
2003,  p.  7).  also,  procedures  for  receiving  the  training 
grant can be burdensome – a deadweight for smaller firms.

Clustering

Clusters,  often  built  for  firms  within  a  manufacturing 
subsector, have started to benefit from their geographi-
cal  proximity  to  undergo  collective  training  activities. 
this is particularly true in europe, where clusters such 
as the advanced textiles manufacturing cluster in Flan-
ders  (Belgium),  the  Brainport  high-tech  cluster  (the 
netherlands)  or  the  medical  technologies  cluster  in 
Baden-wurttemberg (Germany) are exchanging knowl-
edge and expertise through education and training insti-
tutions. as firms collaborate within these clusters, work-
ers are conscious of the different working environments 
and conditions among the firms, exerting pressure on 
employers to ensure that employees are satisfied.

advanced countries either train or provide guidelines 
on how production should take place (Humphrey and 
Schmitz 2001). This knowledge is useful for the cur-
rent job and can be transferred later.

Support private sector–university 
collaboration
When skills need to be developed to suit manufactur-
ing’s highly sophisticated activities, such as R&D and 
innovation, universities may be crucial in producing 
graduates with the right skills, especially in develop-
ing countries (World Bank 2010). But as with basic 
education, and even TVET in many countries, there 
tends to be little collaboration with the private sector 
in higher education. Teaching methods are typically 
academic in style, denying students the opportunity to 
learn practical skills for manufacturing jobs.

So, to develop the higher education system to bet-
ter suit industry’s needs for higher skills, a variety of 
similar policies need to be put in place, like those pro-
posed for general education and TVET systems.

Ensure a focus on youth
Young  people  are  the  group  most  vulnerable  to 
unemployment, especially during a recession. A focus on 

8“ It is important to develop structured 

and recognized education and training 
accessible for the informal sector

jobs for them is important for three main reasons: job-
lessness at that stage is a strong predictor of unemploy-
ment later; it means a loss in the experience component 
of human capital formation; and it may discourage some 
of them, causing them to drop out of the labour market.
So supporting youth is very important, whether 
the  political  focus  is  on  industrial  competitiveness 
through  skills  or  on  social  policies  (Box  8.5).  The 
majority of education and training for manufacturing 
employment and the policies suggested in this chapter 
are by nature more directed towards youth, particu-
larly TVET and apprenticeship.

But these policies may not always be enough to 
cater  to  all  needs.  In  developing  countries  particu-
larly – where general educational attainment tends 
to be lower and students are more likely to have fewer 
years  of  education  –  second-chance  initiatives  can 
be particularly beneficial, especially for those on low 
incomes and in the informal sector.

Do not forget the informal economy
Access to formal or recognized TVET is hard for peo-
ple working in the informal sector or in a micro- or 

small enterprise. Training is usually informal, on the 
job and with no recognized certification. In Morocco 
80 percent of those in the informal sector, whether 
employers or employees, had no other skills than those 
developed on the job. In Ethiopia virtually nobody in 
the informal sector had any kind of formal training 
(Walther 2011).

But a significant share of those employed in manu-
facturing work in the informal sector or within small 
firms (many of which operate in the informal econ-
omy). Additionally, in many countries the informal 
sector is the main entry point for youth for any kind of 
employment, even those who have completed higher 
education. In Central Africa 60 percent of those who 
have undertaken a bachelor’s or master’s course started 
their career in the informal sector (Walther 2011).

So it is important to develop structured and recog-
nized education and training accessible for the infor-
mal sector to develop the sector, increase its produc-
tivity and strengthen the link between the informal 
and formal economies, making it easier for workers to 
move from the former to the latter. For such training 
to be effective, it should focus on addressing the skill

Youth unemployment in Tunisia

In tunisia the rate of unemployment has reached an aver-
age of 46 percent among qualified youth. after the revolu-
tion employment creation with a special focus on youth 
in the lagging regions has become the first development 
priority for the new tunisian government.

as part of a project funded by the spanish govern-
ment and the Millennium development Goal Fund, unIdo 
in partnership with four other united  nations agencies,1 
implemented a joint programme to support the tunisian 
government in its efforts to create jobs and prevent migra-
tion. unIdo intervention focused on a three-fold approach 
that aimed at reinforcing local support structures (public, 
private  and  civil  society  organizations),  assisting  young 
entrepreneurs to create and develop their enterprises in 
selected value chains (such as the handicraft and carpet 
value chain) and finally enhancing youth participation and 
information sharing through a web-based platform.

•  200 youth trained in enterprise creation and develop-

ment, of which 16 youth in the carpet industry.

•  3,000 youth trained and actively engaged on the digi-

tal entrepreneurship Platform.2

•  More than 100 enterprises created by youth.
•  900 productive jobs created.
•  three  studies  on  “Investment  opportunities  in  the 
selected regions”, “handicraft and carpet value-chain

needs of the informal sector in particular, in addition 
to enabling access. But as the informal sector has a 
larger share of young people, women and less-skilled 
workers, and stretches across all sectors of the econ-

schemes to match the sector’s heterogeneity (Gibson 
2013).4 Training must also be recognized nationally,

2.  A  review  of  the  data  and  different  studies  by 
the  European  Centre  for  the  Development  of 
Vocational Training suggests that TVET has a 
stronger positive effect on firms in manufacturing 
than in other sectors (CEDEFOP 2011). Studying 
the  effects  of  vocational  education  in  Ghana, 

Jones (2001) finds that, besides TVET increas-
ing manufacturing productivity, employees who 
have undergone vocational education have higher 
productivity than graduates with only secondary 
education, even if the former had fewer years of 
formal education.

3.  The  likelihood  of  firms  engaging  in  formal  in-
house training depends on three main factors: size 
– larger firms are more likely to invest in train-
ing (Almeida and Aterido 2011); ownership and 
orientation – foreign and export-oriented firms 
are more likely to train; and education attainment 
of the workforce and management and training 
capabilities of employers – capable workforce and 
management  are  more  aware  of  the  benefits  of 
training.

4.  Although  the  informal  sector  has  largely  been 
ignored  in  the  past,  some  developing  countries 
are  addressing  this  omission.  For  example,  the 
Kenyan government has established a Ministry 
of Technical Training and Applied Technology, 
with responsibility for the sector (Gibson 2007).

8Chapter 9
International cooperation

Manufacturing  industry  worldwide  is  facing  chal-
lenges, most fundamentally generating large numbers 
of jobs while taking into account the impact of climate 
change, which requires a major transformation and 
restructuring of industrial activity (see Chapter 6). Yet 
many developing countries and economies in transi-
tion lack the necessary human, financial and technical 
resources to make this shift – a shortfall that interna-
tional cooperation can help address.

After discussing the impact on developing coun-
tries of a national policy space that has been curtailed 
by  international  agreements  on  trade,  this  chapter 
looks at international cooperation mediated through 
institutions like the United Nations Conference on 
Trade and Development (UNCTAD), UNIDO and 
the International Labour Organization (ILO), par-
ticularly in three areas: liberating economic resources 
for investment in manufacturing, facilitating cross-
border adoption of labour standards and generating 
learning effects on industrial restructuring.

International  cooperation  in  the  first  of  these 
areas contributes to economic development by pro-
viding  and  protecting  investments,  often  through 
bilateral  investment  treaties  (BITs).  These  treaties 
have  fast  become  a  fixture  in  regulating  interna-
tional  trade,  and  because  they  have  a  measured, 
positive impact on foreign direct investment (FDI), 
they  have  proved  useful  for  regulating  cross-bor-
der  investments.  Further,  BITs  and  other  invest-
ment  regulations  may  also  improve  conditions  for 
manufacturing-related  employment  generation, 
which  international  organizations  can  encourage. 
In the second area cooperation can help harmonize, 
strengthen  and  enforce  labour  standards  globally, 
particularly in the fairly new area of private sustain-
ability standards. It can also assist in generating and 
sharing knowledge – the third area – where emerg-
ing platforms and forums that aim to promote indus-
trial development can serve as vehicles, as well as the 
traditional multilateral bodies.

This chapter also stresses the need to ensure that 
an economic dimension appears on the development 
agenda  after  2015,  unlike  the  original  Millennium 
Development Goals (MDGs). As the world consid-
ers how to move beyond the MDGs, the opportunity 
arises to build a framework with goals anchored in all 
of the three dimensions of sustainable development – 
economic, social and environmental.

The trade-off between national policy 
autonomy and trade liberalization
To address global environmental and economic chal-
lenges,  manufacturing  industry  needs  to  be  trans-
formed  and  restructured  into  sustainable  industry. 
But to guide and as necessary stimulate this transfor-
mation, national regulators need policy autonomy, a 
position that may be at odds with international coop-
eration through trade agreements.

Such agreements seek to reduce barriers to trade 
and enhance trade through legally binding rules. Yet 
trade liberalization is not itself the ultimate goal. Even 
the first paragraph of the preamble to the Marrakesh 
Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization 
(WTO) refers to trade in accord with the objective of 
sustainable development and the protection and pres-
ervation of the environment.1 International coopera-
tion, especially through trade and investment agree-
ments, aims to lead to regulatory convergence, which 
requires countries to relinquish some of their policy 
autonomy (Trebilcock and Howse 1998), thus remov-
ing certain policy options from a regulator’s arsenal.

The reduction of policy autonomy can manifest 
itself in two ways. First, it may no longer be possible 
to use a certain policy instrument, such as subsidies. 
Second, a national regulator may have to refrain from 
introducing new (or applying current) legislation to 
protect non-trade policy objectives such as health or 
the environment.

A  clear  example  of  the  former  is  the  WTO 
Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures 

159

“ International cooperation can 

contribute to manufacturing employment 
by legally protecting foreign investors

– a powerful and frequently used policy instrument – 
which prohibits governments to use subsidies under 
certain conditions (Coppens 2009, 2013). Similarly, 
many export restrictions are only allowed when they 
follow the relevant rules in the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade (Karapinar 2011).

The debate on the balance between policy auton-
omy and trade liberalization is especially heated in 
cases of the latter type where measures not directly 
related to trade are assessed for their compliance with 
trade rules, and these cases give rise to some of the 
most contentious decisions by the dispute settlement 
organs of the WTO.

But it would be unfair to qualify WTO dispute 
settlement  as  in  itself  hostile  to  industrial  policies, 
particularly those related to sustainable industrializa-
tion. Considering that the WTO has identified more 
than  100  trade-restrictive  measures,  which  include 
some measures with industrial environment in mind, 
enacted by Group of Twenty countries in only seven 
months, the disputes before the WTO are merely the 
tip of the iceberg (EC 2013; WTO 2013). Still, the 
issue of policy autonomy remains crucial for the legiti-
macy of trade agreements.

Bilateral investment treaties – 
protecting and promoting foreign 
direct investment
International  cooperation  can  contribute  to  manu-
facturing employment by legally protecting foreign 
investors.2 As the World Investment Report 2011 puts 
it: “Investment promotion policy can be an impor-
tant means to build productive capacity in developing 
countries” (UNCTAD 2011, p. 105).

FDI influences employment in manufacturing in 
several ways: by increasing the number of jobs through 
direct investment in production facilities; by lifting 
productivity  through  knowledge  spillovers  (World 
Bank 2013a) and by raising the quality of jobs, espe-
cially through higher wages and better working condi-
tions (Mosley 2011). But as shown in Chapter 5 and 
touched on again in Box 9.1, FDI is not a one-way bet.
FDI  represents  a  commitment  of  capital:  such 
investment  transfers  financial,  technological  and 
informational  resources  from  owners  in  one  coun-
try to new subsidiaries, plants, offices or owners in 
a  second  –  host  –  country.  Investing  directly  in  a 
host  country  allows  firms  to  circumvent  complica-
tions associated with servicing foreign markets and 

Box 9.1 
A few warning lights for foreign direct investment

Foreign direct investment (FdI) is not the unmitigated boon 
for accelerated economic development that some claim it 
to be. First, it can crowd out domestic investment – that 
is, investment from foreign sources discourages domestic 
investment by host-country nationals (Caves 1996). as de 
Backer and sleuweagen (2003, p. 71) put it: foreign firms 
paying  higher  wages  “skim  the  domestic  labour  market 
and decrease the labour supply for domestic companies, 
at least in the short term”.

second  and  relatedly,  newer  analyses  are  find-
ing  weaker,  negative  links  between  innovation  and  FdI 
inflows. this is a significant step backwards for FdI’s pro-
ponents, as a principal rationale for liberalizing access to 
FdI is for the domestic market to gain from technological 
spillovers. Jin, Garcia and salomon (2013), studying the 
spanish manufacturing sector over 1990–2002, find that 
as  inward  FdI  flows  increase,  and  despite  rises  in  total 

factor  productivity  and  labour  productivity,  innovation 
decreases, measured by the numbers of patent applica-
tions and of new products launched on the market. states 
may then be faced with a decision: support productivity 
increases by encouraging FdI or favour innovation by lim-
iting FdI.

thus  the  economic  gains  promised  by  FdI  are  less 
clear cut than some supporters argue: crowding out and 
stifled  innovation  create  hurdles  for  domestic  employ-
ment  generation  by  eliminating  the  organic  processes 
of firm creation and growth. yet these issues are largely 
observed in the short term: over longer periods, crowding-
out effects diminish and a measurable uptick appears in 
domestic entrepreneurship through learning, networking 
and linkage effects between domestic and foreign firms 
(de Backer and sleuweagen 2003).

9“ Bilateral investment treaties aim 

to protect the sources of FDI and so 
stimulate investment and create jobs

fragmented production processes (Helpman, Melitz 
and Yeaple 2003). When FDI roots a firm in a foreign 
market through a subsidiary or similar entity, firms 
tap local labour and supply markets to bolster output.
But foreign direct investors run risks, including 
expropriation and unfair treatment, as FDI host states 
maintain the legal right to decide how to treat incom-
ing foreign investment – a right upheld by the UN 
Charter in 1974 – meaning that FDI-importing states 
have  full  discretion  over  the  conditions,  tax  rates, 
property  rights,  dispute-settlement  procedures  and 
treatment afforded to international investors.

Rules established in BITs allay these concerns by 
requiring states to compensate for expropriation and 
allowing repatriation of assets. To avert discrimination 
against foreign investment, BITs also extend national 
treatment, most-favoured nation treatment and the 
like to investments defined as FDI in the BIT. BITs 
thus aim to protect the sources of FDI and so stimu-
late investment and create jobs. They mitigate risks 
and credibly demonstrate the host country’s commit-
ment to assuring the legal and domestic conditions to 
house FDI safely. Governments accede to these strin-
gent conditions because the prospects of FDI entice, 
promising  technology  transfers  and  domestic  job 
creation (Elkins, Guzman and Simmons 2006). They 
are willing to subject themselves to multilaterally sup-
ported dispute-settlement mechanisms.

The number of BITs has surged in the last cou-
ple of decades as the main tool for states looking to 
facilitate FDI, from a mere 447 in 1990 to more than 
2,000 unique, bilateral agreements in 2000 and more 
than 3,000 in 2011 (UNCTAD 2011). Recognizing 
this increasingly dense web, discussions arose within 
the  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and 
Development  (OECD)  to  harmonize  FDI  policies 
in the mid-1990s. The result was a draft agreement 
called  the  Multilateral  Agreement  on  Investment, 
which attempted to institutionalize FDI promotion 
and protection policies within the OECD and to pro-
vide internal dispute resolution mechanisms (OECD 
1998). But incompatibility among states’ preferences 
for  the  contents  of  BITs  stifled  progress  towards 

multilateral cooperation in 1998, and OECD states 
subsequently returned to strictly bilateral approaches 
to regulating FDI.

I

Generally positive impacts of bilateral 
investment treaties
The question remains whether BITs positively – if at 
all – affect FDI flows. Several authors approach this 
issue,  employing  political,  economic  and  legal  per-
spectives. Neumeyer and Spess (2005), for example, 
analyse the effect of BITs on FDI flows to developing 
countries. They find a positive relationship between 
BITs  and  FDI,  indicating  that  an  agreement  –  all 
other factors held constant – increases FDI flows to a 
BIT signatory. Importantly, FDI inflows are not iso-
lated to just the BIT signatory partners, so this result 
includes FDI inflows from countries without BITs.

More recent findings also tend to find a similarly 
positive  relationship,  though  these  results  are  con-
tingent on political factors. In fact, most of the more 
recent studies, such Büthe and Milner (2009), depart 
from traditional trade and legal analyses of BITs to 
concentrate on political conditions and their role in 
shaping BITs and FDI. Along this seam, Tobin and 
Rose-Ackerman (2011) report that political conditions 
are the most important factors for attracting FDI, but 
also that a BIT serves as a guarantee to improve politi-
cal stability of domestic institutions. In this way BITs 
are  capable  of  attracting  FDI  when  signed  between 
developed  (FDI-exporting)  and  developing  (FDI-
importing) states. Still, they find that legal institutions 
and mechanisms provided for in BITs complement, but 
do not supplant, sound, functioning domestic institu-
tions in the developing country partner.

Mixed results indicate that other factors influence 
FDI inflows, but as Büthe and Milner (2009) note, 
BITs are now standard means for states to bilaterally 
coordinate FDI policies. In this way investors increas-
ingly identify BITs as a prerequisite when scouting for 
new countries for outward FDI (Büthe and Milner 
2009). Most notable, though, are BITs’ impacts on 
regulatory governance and market liberalization. The 
terms  they  embody  dismantle  investment  barriers

9“ International bodies have an opportunity to 

bolster states’ benefits from bilateral investment 
treaties by buttressing coordination efforts

by legally binding signatories to non-discriminatory 
behaviour towards foreign investors and unparalleled 
permission for FDI entry. A by-product of relegating 
dispute-settlement processes to international bodies, 
BITs strengthen the regulatory quality of their poli-
cies on investment.

Allee and Peinhardt (2011) offer more conclusive 
evidence of BITs’ impact on FDI. They find that sign-
ing a BIT increases FDI inflows to signatory states, 
but this result is conditional, too. An economy’s FDI 
picks up if the state is neither accused nor found guilty 
of violating the agreement’s terms. States taken to the 
International  Centre  for  Settlement  of  Investment 
Disputes (ICSID) see a significant decrease in FDI 
inflows  no  matter  the  number  of  BITs  they  have 
signed.  Allee  and  Peinhardt  (2011)  also  note  that 
states must be able to support BIT clauses institution-
ally to enjoy the benefits (employment and otherwise) 
of greater FDI.

Persuading developing countries of the 
benefits of bilateral investment treaties
Despite the sharp rise in numbers of BITs signed in the 
last two decades, many countries (mainly developing) 
have failed to be among the parties. International bod-
ies have an opportunity to bolster states’ benefits from 
them in four ways, by buttressing coordination efforts.
First, investment-related international cooperation 
can  be  multilateral  or  bilateral.  Multilateral  agree-
ments are far better for efficiency and economic ben-
efit, but are much harder to conclude and none is likely 
in the near future. Here is where international organi-
zations can initially help: they can serve as a vehicle or 
forum for aggregating interests. As seen, multilateral 
efforts in the OECD in the later 1990s failed due to 
irreconcilable differences on investment protection. 
Since then the number of parties in BITs, and thus 
with  “unique  preferences”  on  protection,  has  risen, 
complicating prospects for a multilateral agreement.

International organizations can instead support 
bilateral and regional efforts by extending their data-
bases on investment agreements and ensuring trans-
parent reporting of agreements signed, cases disputed 

and the firms and locations of FDI. Such data are valu-
able for states considering new negotiations or firms 
seeking new investment locations. This will aid devel-
oping countries especially, as knowledge on standard 
conditions for national treatment and disputes can 
help  them  negotiate  better.  Moreover,  understand-
ing the public nature of such data encourages states 
to comply more rigidly with the agreements they have 
signed, which in turn increases the credibility of their 
commitments (Büthe and Milner 2009).

Second, international organizations can provide 
consultative services to states interested in pursuing 
BITs or other investment agreements. Negotiations 
often begin with a template that states keep on file 
and alter according to the partners targeted for a par-
ticular agreement. But developing states often lack the 
administrative capacity to fully develop such a tem-
plate or, worse still, lack the administrative capacity 
to  negotiate  with  states  holding  greater  bargaining 
power. To this end, international organizations can 
lend expertise to developing states to institute a well-
rounded BIT template or to train administrative staff 
responsible for negotiations on strategies and typical 
agreement  clauses.  UNCTAD  and  UNIDO  seem 
particularly fit for such a task, as its in-house exper-
tise on BITs is substantial. For example, UNIDO’s 
Investment Promotion Programme has been provid-
ing advice and capacity building for 30 years to invest-
ment promotion officers in the developing world, help-
ing start international industrial partnerships through 
FDI in developing countries and establish investment 
and  technology  promotion  units  and  agencies  in 
developed and developing countries.

Third, international organizations can disseminate 
knowledge on investment agreements. Although viola-
tions of BITs’ terms trigger marked reputational dam-
age that hurts FDI inflows, developing states largely 
consider  BITs  ceremonial  agreements  with  little  or 
non-strictly binding terms (Allee and Peinhardt 2011). 
Here ICSID can disseminate information to states less 
keen on litigation (usually developing countries) on 
how to use ICSID to settle disputes, by creating a lend-
ing system for states burdened by dispute-settlement

9“ International organizations should also 

ensure that their capacity building has a focus on 
technical expertise in bilateral investment treaties

costs and by advising states negotiating BITs on the 
implications of clauses related to dispute settlement.

Fourth,  academic  studies  indicate  BITs’  posi-
tive influence on FDI flows, noting that signing and 
fulfilling the terms of a BIT increase FDI flows to 
partner countries (Haftel 2010), but only if the states 
show institutional quality (Büthe and Milner 2009), 
especially in the judiciary (Tobin and Rose-Ackerman 
2010). So international organizations with expertise 
in establishing domestic institutions, ensuring their 
quality and monitoring their functioning can inter-
vene to improve institutional quality where most per-
tinent to BITs. Tapping the data and resources of bod-
ies like the European Commission, ICSID, OECD, 
UNCTAD, UNIDO and World Bank can translate 
vast quantities of information into capacity building 
for domestic institutions. International organizations 
should also ensure that their capacity building has a 
focus on technical expertise in BITs.

Private sustainability standards
Another area for international cooperation is in inter-
national  labour  standards,  particularly  for  manu-
facturing. They have a long history, often tied to the 

ILO,  which  urges  their  global  adoption.  Thus  over 
many decades a body of international rules has devel-
oped  on  labour  standards  including  wages,  worker 
safety  and  collective  bargaining.  Beyond  the  ILO’s 
norms and procedures to enforce them, trade unions, 
nongovernment organizations and social movements 
have put enforcement high on the political agenda, 
and often criticize national and international govern-
mental agencies for not enforcing them properly (de 
Bakker et al. 2013; Keck and Sikkink 1998), as well as 
many leading firms and brand owners. Social activists’ 
discovery that reputation was a firm’s tangible asset 
that they could easily harm spurred a proliferation of 
social protests, such as the Clean Clothes Campaign, 
directed at apparel and textile firms (Bartley 2003).

These  criticisms  prompted  firms  in  the  early 
1990s to respond with new forms of private govern-
ance, which aimed to assure international standards 
along  the  whole  value  chain  (Abbott  and  Snidal 
2009;  Mattli  and  Woods  2009).  First,  many  firms 
established codes of conduct and initiatives on cor-
porate social responsibility (CSR; Box 9.2). In 2003 
the World Bank estimated that firms had more than 
1,000  codes  of  conduct,  many  in  manufacturing 

Box 9.2 
Corporate social responsibility and industrial restructuring

In a world attuned to voluntary regulation, corporate social 
responsibility  (Csr)  has  emerged  as  a  promising  tool  to 
incorporate environmental and social concerns in industrial 
restructuring.  But  large  multinationals  dominate  the  Csr 
movement, a concern for the united nations and its special-
ized agencies, which aim to bring small and medium-size 
enterprises (sMes) into the movement. Multinationals often 
invest heavily in Csr policies and campaigns, putting pres-
sure  on  smaller  companies  that  supply  them  or  struggle 
to make their own way in the international market. already 
grappling  with  requirements  to  meet  strict  standards  on 
food safety and quality, many sMes lack the expertise or 
finance to build sustainable business and employment prac-
tices. without help to create socially responsible and sus-
tainable practices, they risk being left behind as big market 
players look to suppliers who can meet these criteria.

working  with  large  private  companies,  interna-
tional  organizations  such  as  the  International  labour 

organization  and  unIdo  are  adapting  their  technical 
assistance  programmes  to  include  the  Csr  needs  of 
sMes  in  their  projects  (Ilo  2013;  unIdo  2013b).  they 
receive support in better management techniques, pro-
ductivity  and  safer,  sustainable  production  and  labour 
practices, which should create a win-win situation for both 
suppliers  and  buyers  as  large  companies  can  demon-
strate their commitment to social inclusion and to society 
by bringing smaller suppliers further into the value chain.

From the point of view of sMes, if companies achieve 
lower absenteeism, fewer accidents and better working 
conditions,  along  with  lower  energy  consumption  and 
waste, then competitiveness as well as social and envi-
ronmental responsibility can go together. In practice these 
projects show that the business case for Csr for smaller 
companies is no different from that of large corporations – 
better productivity, morale and competitiveness.

9“ Pioneering labelling and certification 

schemes involved firms, non-governmental 
organizations, trade unions, governments 
and international organizations to create 
new forms of international regulation

subsectors such as textiles, footwear and wood pro-
cessing, and many more have come about since. But 
many codes have been attacked for being too weak 
and serving as mere “window dressing” (Wells 2007), 
encouraging yet new forms of private governance that 
brought together actors and stakeholders.

Besides  those  from  multilateral  organizations, 
many  private  initiatives  emerged  such  as  the  Fair 
Labor Association and Social Accountability 8000. 
These pioneering labelling and certification schemes 
involved  firms,  non-governmental  organizations, 
trade unions, governments and international organi-
zations to create new forms of international regulation 
(Abbott and Snidal 2009).

Labour  standards  also  spilled  over  into  many 
other  initiatives  aimed  at  promoting  such  “private 
sustainability  standards”  through  certification  and 
eco-labelling (Abbott and Snidal 2009; Marx 2011).3 
Transnational certification initiatives aim to imple-
ment labour standards in global production processes 
and communicate to consumers across national and 
regional  markets  that  certified  products  have  been 
made according to these standards.

This proliferation of labels and certification sys-
tems was driven by several interrelated factors, includ-
ing the commitment of multinational firms to CSR 
(O’Rourke 2012) and that of governments to support 
private sustainability standards through public pro-
curement legislation.

Many such standards now cover multiple sectors, 
with  many  variations,  but  common  characteristics 
are an organization that defines social and ecological 
standards – and procedures to check that products 
or processes conform to these standards. When they 
conform,  a  certificate  is  awarded  (sometimes  used 
for advertising and promotion), and here differences 
emerge  in  stringency  of  standards  (Fransen  2012; 
O’Rourke  2003)  and  the  certification  procedure 
(Gereffi, Garcia-Johnson and Sasser 2001).

Impact on labour conditions
Private  sustainability  standards  were  initially  wel-
comed as “one of the most innovative and startling 

institutional designs of the past 50 years” (Cashore, 
Auld  and  Newsom  2004)  and  were  regarded  as 
key  instruments  in  ratcheting  up  labour  standards 
internationally  (Sabel,  Fung  and  O’Rourke  2000). 
But  doubts  have  emerged  more  recently  over  their 
potential to improve labour conditions in developing 
countries.

Some  reservations  stem  from  journalistic  expo-
sés  of  certified  factories  that  breach  the  standards, 
most  dramatically  recent  fires  in  garment  factories 
in Bangladesh and Pakistan, which killed many hun-
dreds of workers. Others come from the lack of cred-
ible empirical data that these systems are effective.

Effectiveness  in  this  context  is  often  measured 
along two dimensions: problem solving and process 
(Marx, Bécault and Wouters 2012; Tikina and Innes 
2008). The former is the degree to which the prob-
lem that prompted the certification initiative is solved 
(often compliance with ILO conventions and stand-
ards); the latter evaluates the adoption rate of certi-
fication initiatives by firms (the number of certified 
firms).

On problem solving there is some evidence that 
private  sustainability  standards  improve  working 
conditions.  For  the  Forest  Stewardship  Council, 
de Azevedo and de Freitas (2003) analyse the impact 
of certification on working conditions of workers in 
the Amazon basin in Brazil and find that in certified 
forests the logging camps and safety of forest opera-
tions  are  significantly  better  than  in  non-certified 
forests. But some “on the ground” reports or testimo-
nies call into question the thoroughness of audited 
factories’ compliance with labour conditions, ques-
tioning their impact (Esbenshade 2004; Locke 2013; 
O’Rourke 2000).

For  process  effectiveness,  annual  reports  of  the 
leading initiatives on private sustainability standards 
show that the number of certified factories is limited, 
pointing to a very low overall adoption rate given that 
many retailers work with several thousands of con-
tractors, each with several subcontractors. In addition, 
most certification is in only a few countries such as 
Bangladesh, China, India, Pakistan and Viet Nam.4

key knowledge managers and coordinators, 
bringing together actors to share their 
information and learn from others

Private sustainability standards and 
international cooperation
Thus how these mechanisms are playing out in the 
real  world  is  largely  unknown.  No  sound,  overall 
quantitative studies – to our knowledge – exist that 
estimate the effects of these mechanisms on labour 
conditions  or  employment.  The  scattered  available 
studies  give  some  evidence  on  certain  aspects  but 
no consolidated picture (Locke 2013; Reich 2008; 
Vogel 2008). Here lies an important role for multi-
lateral organizations, especially a new international 
body, the United Nations Forum on Sustainability 
Standards (Box 9.3).

Generating and sharing knowledge
Multilateral organizations are becoming key knowl-
edge managers and coordinators, bringing together 
actors to share their information and learn from oth-
ers. International cooperation on knowledge sharing is 
expected to enhance mutual learning and peer review, 
identify good practices and their conditions for trans-
ferability and develop joint policy initiatives or iden-
tify areas where joint initiatives can reinforce states’ 
current policies (Tholoniat 2010).

The key focus in sharing knowledge is on manag-
ing and coordinating knowledge (Abbott and Snidal 
2010).  Several  authors  propose  a  comprehensive 
approach  to  knowledge  management  with  a  strong 
emphasis on a networked approach to learning and

improved  network  management  (Rayner,  Buck 
and  Katila  2011).  The  former  is  necessary  because 
improved knowledge management does not necessar-
ily lead to learning. A key issue is bridging knowledge 
generation and use, which can be achieved through 
networked  learning  platforms  defined  “as  an  inte-
grated set of services that provide information, tools 
and  resources  to  support  policy  learning”  (Rayner, 
Buck and Katila 2011, p. 141).

These knowledge platforms aim to promote struc-
tural change and green growth strategies, including 
UNIDO’s  Green  Industry  Platform.  This  is  a  vol-
untary  multi-stakeholder  partnership  designed  to 
provide a framework for participants, individually or 
in groups, to take specific and measurable action to 
advance environmentally sustainable approaches and 
employment in industry (GIP 2013).

Sustainable manufacturing and 
employment post-2015
As  the  world  considers  how  to  move  beyond  the 
MDGs after 2015, the opportunity arises to build a 
framework with goals anchored in the three dimen-
sions of sustainable development – economic, social 
and environmental. The eight MDGs were intended 
to unify pursuit of these three dimensions, but an eco-
nomic dimension was missing and a target on employ-
ment  was  only  added  in  2008  (UN  System  Task 
Team 2012). Generating new employment remains a 

the  united  nations  Forum  on  sustainability  standards 
(unFss)  is  a  new  platform  to  generate  knowledge  and 
information  on  private  sustainability  standards  with  a 
particular focus on their potential contribution to devel-
opment. It is a joint initiative of the Food and agriculture 
organization, unIdo, International trade Centre, united 
nations  environment  Programme  and  united  nations 
Conference on trade and development. unFss can make 
a contribution in several areas.

First,  it  could  pool  data  and  research  on  the  effec-
tiveness  of  these  systems  and  their  potential  employ-
ment  impact.  In  doing  so,  it  might  consider  expanding 

the  systems’  focus  (not  only  agri-foods)  to  the  sectors 
in manufacturing where private standards are important, 
such as textiles, apparel, leather, wood products, paper, 
chemicals and furniture.

unFss  could  also  consider  developing  a  watchdog 
function for private sustainability standards. some authors 
have argued that these systems differ in several aspects 
directly related to their effectiveness and potential employ-
ment, in numbers and quality (o’rourke 2003; sabel, Fung 
and o’rourke 2001; van waarden 2011). Most important, 
these systems differ in how they enforce standards.

9“ The post-2015 agenda offers a new 

opportunity for states to recouple considerations 
for sustainable manufacturing and employment 
with the focus on human development

pivotal global social concern, however: the first indica-
tive findings from the United Nations–led consulta-
tions on the post-2015 development agenda, through 
which  more  than  200,000  people  from  across  the 
world contributed their views on the ideal develop-
ment priorities after the expiry of the MDGs, show 
that job creation will remain a major social challenge, 
encompassing almost all economies well beyond 2015 
(UNDG 2013). The post-2015 agenda thus offers a 
new opportunity for states to recouple considerations 
for sustainable manufacturing and employment with 
the focus on human development that dominated the 
original MDG programme, by recommitting to the 
economic dimensions of development.

Four  challenges  stand  out:  concerns  about  the 
nature of the relationship among growth, equality and 
development; perceptions by some parties of histori-
cal over-emphasis on economic globalization and the 
market or on the role of public policy in economic 
activity;  uncertainty  about  the  environmental  and 
resource impacts of expanding the productive activi-
ties of developing countries; and fear of obscuring the 
clarity and simplicity of the outcome-oriented MDGs. 
All need to be squarely addressed in the post-2015 pro-
cess (UN 2013c).

The first steps in this direction are evident in the 
United Nations High Level Panel of Eminent Persons 
on the Post-2015 Development Agenda, which com-
bines global development and sustainability with pro-
visions and goals for industry and trade.5 Reflecting 
on  the  accomplishments  achieved  and  the  hurdles 
encountered under the MDG programme, the Panel 
outlined five transformative shifts. One transforma-
tion specifically links “sustained, long term, inclusive 
growth” to overcoming the challenges of unemploy-
ment,  resource  security  and  adaptation  to  climate 
change and calls for the transformation of economies 
for jobs and inclusive growth (UN 2013b). Targeted 
efforts to meet these goals hold the potential to pro-
vide  47  million  more  workers  with  good  jobs  and 
livelihoods and to equip 200 million more young peo-
ple with the skills they need to get good work (UN 
2013b).  Following  the  Panel’s  report,  the  General 

Assembly  reaffirmed  the  essential  contribution  of 
industrial development and employment to achieving 
internationally agreed development goals and called 
for “giving appropriate consideration to the issue of 
industrial development in the elaboration of the devel-
opment agenda beyond 2015” (UN 2013c, p. 3).

The  findings  of  the  Panel  and  the  implications 
from  other  post-2015  processes  such  as  the  Open 
Working Group on Sustained and Inclusive Economic 
Growth, Infrastructure and Industrialization indicate 
that clear action from international organizations can 
aid in addressing these concerns as well as building the 
capabilities and labour forces that will allow countries 
to resolve these global development challenges.

Fully bringing sustained, inclusive and sustainable 
economic  growth,  manufacturing  and  employment 
into  the  post-2015  development  framework  means 
paying careful attention to the globalization of pro-
duction, trade, technology and finance that has made 
manufacturing more international and made it harder 
for developing countries to compete internationally. A 
strategy based on developing the productive resources, 
entrepreneurial capabilities and production linkages 
that together determine the capacity of a country to 
produce goods and services and enable it to grow and 
develop could set the stage for a new development part-
nership (UNCTAD 2010b). Along these lines, Japan 
has proposed a post-2015 Pact for Global Wellbeing, 
prioritizing growth that is green, inclusive, shared and 
knowledge based (Berg and Melamed 2012).

These visions of a future where economic growth 
and manufacturing employment are more stable, inclu-
sive, sustainable and equitable arguably contrast with 
the more “quick-win” approach of the MDG era. It 
remains to be seen to what extent the General Assembly 
will adequately resolve these issues when it ultimately 
decides on the post-2015 development agenda during 
its 69th session opening in September 2014.

and steadily growing volume of real income and 
effective demand, and expanding the production

after consultations with civil society, the private 
sector, academia and research institutions from all 
regions in the world. The aim of the report: to set 
out a new development framework.

Chapter 10
Trends in manufacturing 
value added

Since the start of this century industrializing econo-
mies have accounted for a growing share of the world’s 
manufacturing value added (MVA). This trend is as 
much the result of a gradual shift of production from 
industrialized to industrializing countries to benefit 
from cheaper labour, largely improved infrastructure 
and lower social costs, as it is a reflection of the growth 
of  industrializing  countries’  domestic  markets  for 
industrial goods due to higher incomes and a fast-ris-
ing middle class.

The  world’s  MVA  reached  an  all-time  high  of 
$8,900 billion in 2012 (16.7 percent of global GDP), 
recovering fully from the sharp contraction of 2008–
2009  caused  by  the  global  economic  and  financial 
crisis (Figure 10.1).1 MVA’s share in GDP in indus-
trialized countries fell from 16.4 percent in 1990 to 
15.0 percent in 2012, while it rose from 16.5 percent 
to 21.3 percent in industrializing countries.2

In manufacturing, globalization of production and 
the accompanying trade liberalization seem to benefit

industrializing countries, bringing in more financial 
resources, supporting economic growth and generat-
ing employment for a growing population, if at the 
risk of increasing their vulnerability to external shocks. 
Conversely, some industrialized countries are facing 
the tougher task of having to adapt to the new world 
economic scenario with stagnating growth, budgetary 
constraints, unemployment and social unrest.

Manufacturing in industrializing 
countries
Between 1992 and 2012 global MVA nearly doubled, 
from $4,960 billion to $8,900 billion, averaging 3 per-
cent annual growth. While MVA expanded by a mere 
1.8 percent a year in industrialized countries, below 
their  2.1  percent  annual  GDP  growth  rate  for  the 
period, it rose more than three-fold in industrializing 
countries, at an annual rate of 6.4 percent, faster than 
their 5.0 percent a year GDP growth rate (Table 10.1). 
The outcome was a near-doubling in the share in world 
MVA held by industrializing countries, from 18 per-
cent in 1992 to 35 percent in 2012 (Figure 10.2) and a 
corresponding retreat of industrialized countries from 
the  world’s  manufacturing  scene,  underscoring  the 
structural changes taking place in both groups.

These  long-term  trends  conceal  a  clear  change 
of pattern around the turn of the century, coincid-
ing with the accession of China to the World Trade 
Organization and the increased trade liberalization 
and  globalization  of  production  that  ensued.  Over 
1992–2002 the annual growth of world MVA aver-
aged 2.9 percent, whereas over 2002–2012 it averaged 
3.1 percent. Accompanying this seemingly minor dif-
ference was a remarkable acceleration in MVA growth 
in industrializing countries, from an average annual 
5.3 percent over 1992–2002 to 7.4 percent over 2002–
2012. This surge was more than enough to offset the 
deceleration in MVA growth in industrialized econo-
mies, which fell from an average annual 2.3 percent to 
1.4 percent over the same periods.

China  sustained  extremely  high  but  stable  MVA 
growth  throughout  both  periods,  with  annual  rates 
averaging 11.5 percent over 1992–2002 and 11.3 percent 
over 2002–2012, respectively, in itself an extraordinary 
performance but not an explanation for the change of 
pattern. Instead, it is other industrializing countries such 
as India (6.9 percent over 1992–2002; 8.2 percent over 
2002–2012), Turkey (3.0 percent; 6.0 percent), Poland 
(8.0  percent;  8.9  percent),  Argentina  (–1.3  percent; 
7.4 percent), Belarus (2.0 percent; 10.1 percent), Peru 
(3.9 percent; 6.5 percent) and Bangladesh (6.7 percent; 

7.8 percent) that have seen a sharp acceleration of MVA 
growth  since  2002  and  are  thus  responsible  for  the 
increased dynamism. Given that it was in the second 
period when the economic and financial crisis set on, the 
emerging pattern gains in significance.

Despite the gain in world MVA share, manufac-
turing performance among industrializing countries 
and regions varies widely. China increased its share in 
global MVA nearly five-fold over 1992–2012, reach-
ing 17.5 percent, and confirmed its role as the second-
largest manufacturer behind the United States. India

also had an impressive performance (though from a 
much lower base), with its share in global MVA grow-
ing four-fold in the same period and attaining 2.3 per-
cent in 2012.

East  Asia  and  the  Pacific  ($1,810  billion) 
accounted for 58 percent of industrializing country 
MVA in 2012, almost doubling its weight in 20 years 

and drawing largely on China’s performance. South 
and  Central  Asia  ($294  billion),  the  second-most 
dynamic region, managed to keep its industrializing 
country MVA share at 9 percent. By contrast, over 
1992–2012 the industrializing country MVA share of 
Latin America and the Caribbean ($517 billion) fell 
by half from 35 percent to 17 percent, as years of eco-
nomic restructuring under extreme liberalization and 
financial tightness drove economic activity away from 
manufacturing and into commodities and services. A 
similar phenomenon is observed in Europe ($186 bil-
lion in 2012), where the industrializing country MVA 
share tumbled from 10 percent in 1992 to 6 percent 
in 2012 as most of its countries struggled with the 
demands of restructuring following the adoption of a 
market economy. The Middle East and North Africa 
($219 billion) and Sub-Saharan Africa ($84 billion) 
performed better but still lost some of their share in 
industrializing country MVA over the past 20 years.

Manufacturing in industrializing countries is geo-
graphically highly concentrated, with the five lead-
ing  economies  accounting  for  70.9  percent  of  total 
production  in  2012,  up  from  52.7  percent  in  1992 
(Figure 10.3). The high and sustained MVA growth 
in China over this period (11.4 percent on average) is 
behind its emergence as the factory of the world: in

India (7.4 percent average annual MVA growth) kept

10“ The rate at which industrializing 

countries have modified their industrial 
structure and, especially, shifted from 
resource-based manufacturing over 
2002–2011 is particularly noteworthy

Industrialized  and  industrializing  countries  exhib-
ited  similar  trends,  with  their  share  of  resource-
based products declining and that of medium- and 
high-tech products rising over 2002–2011. Low-tech 
manufacturing maintained its MVA share of around 
25 percent over 2002–2011 worldwide but there was 
a substantial relocation of production from industrial-
ized to industrializing countries, mainly to China, in 
search of lower labour costs and closer access to rapidly 
growing markets.

The rate at which industrializing countries have 
modified  their  industrial  structure  and,  especially, 
shifted  from  resource-based  manufacturing  over 
2002–2011 is particularly noteworthy. Their share of 
these products fell from 39.7 percent to 30.3 percent 
over the period and matched in 2012 the weight of 
resource-based manufacturing in industrialized coun-
tries  in  2002.  Equally  noteworthy  is  the  persistent 
concentration of medium- and high-tech manufactur-
ing in industrialized countries. The recent economic 
crisis hit resource-based and low-tech manufacturing 
in these countries hard, but the production of tech-
nologically complex goods seems to have persisted. By 
2011 the share of these products in the industrialized 
countries’ MVA had risen to 53 percent.

Regionally,  South  and  Central  Asia  has  experi-
enced  a  substantial  reduction  in  the  share  of  both 
resource-based (to 24.6 percent in 2012) and low-tech 
products (to 32.8 percent), and an increase in the share 
of medium- and high-tech products (from 31.6 per-
cent to 42.7 percent), largely relying on the transfor-
mation of the manufacturing base in India with more 
technologically advanced products. East Asia and the 
Pacific  already  had  a  fairly  high  share  of  medium- 
and high-tech products in 2002, which increased to 
41.6 percent in 2011 as other economies in the region 
joined China in producing technologically complex 
goods  for  global  value  chains  and  production  net-
works.  The  relocation  of  low-tech  production  from 
industrialized countries, mainly but not exclusively to 
China, accounts for the expansion of the MVA share 
of these products in the region from 23.9 percent in 
2002 to 31.1 percent in 2011.

Europe  and  the  Middle  East  and  North  Africa 
exhibit a similar pattern of shedding resource-based 
manufacturing (the respective shares fell to 38.4 per-
cent  and  40.3  percent  in  2011)  and  embracing 
medium-  and  high-tech  production  (the  respective 
shares rose to 30.1 percent and 32.7 percent in 2011), 
but they still have a long way to go to reach average 
industrializing-country  shares  for  both  categories. 
Latin America and the Caribbean and Sub-Saharan 
Africa have shown the least change in their manufac-
turing base in terms of technological complexity of 
products over 2002–2011: as in 2002, in 2011 they 
were heavily concentrated in producing resource-based 
goods (with shares of 40.6 percent and 49.0 percent, 
respectively), and marginally increased their medium- 
and  high-tech  manufacturing  (to  34.1  percent  and 
26.1 percent, respectively).

Manufacturing value added by 
industry sector
In 2011 the dominant manufacturing sectors world-
wide were food and beverages (11.6 percent), chemi-
cals and chemical products (11.2 percent), machinery 
and equipment (8.9 percent), basic metals (8.6 per-
cent) and radio, television and communication equip-
ment (8.3 percent; Table 10.3). The last two had made 
significant gains over 2002–2011 thanks to the higher 
demand for basic metals derived from the acceleration 
of MVA growth in industrializing countries and the 
global surge in demand for electronic devices. Fifteen 
manufacturing sectors registered a decrease in their 
MVA share worldwide over 2002–2011, from a com-
bined 70.4 percent to 62.0 percent, including mainly 
traditional manufacturing sectors such as food and 
beverages,  textiles,  wood  products,  and  paper  and 
printing, but also coke and refined petroleum prod-
ucts, chemicals, rubber, non-metallic products, fabri-
cated metal products, furniture and even motor vehi-
cles. The only seven sectors that increased their MVA 
share, from a combined 29.4 percent to 38.0 percent, 
were largely advanced manufacturing such as machin-
ery and equipment; office, accounting and computing 
machinery; electrical machinery; radio, television and

communication  equipment;  medical,  precision  and 
optical instruments; and other transport equipment, 
which  confirms  the  shift  towards  production  with 
higher technological complexity worldwide.

In industrializing countries the leading sectors in 
2011 were basic metals (15.1 percent), food and bever-
ages (12.1 percent) and chemicals and chemical prod-
ucts (10.4 percent). The near doubling of the share of 
basic metals in a short time (from 8.2 percent in 2002) 
is an indicator of the impact that the pull effect of 
accelerated manufacturing in industrializing countries 
is having on resource-producing countries. Machinery 
and equipment (7.2 percent) and radio, television and 

communication equipment (6.1 percent) also showed 
large gains in MVA share.

In  2002  industrialized  countries  were  gener-
ally the largest producers (52 percent or more) in all 
manufacturing  sectors  (Table  10.4).  The  substantial 
industrialization efforts and expansion of markets in 
industrializing  countries  since  2002,  coupled  with 
the repercussions of the recent crisis on industrialized 
countries, have produced a significant shift in the dis-
tribution of manufacturing activities worldwide, and in 
2011 industrializing countries accounted for more than 
two-thirds (70 percent or more) of world production 
of low-tech products in labour-intensive sectors such as

tobacco, textiles, wearing apparel and leather. Across 
the board over 2002–2011, industrializing countries 
easily doubled or even trebled their world share in many 
manufacturing sectors, either by relocating existing pro-
duction from industrialized countries or starting new 
production. But industrialized countries still maintain 
a considerable lead (more than 70 percent of world pro-
duction) in technologically complex, high value-added 
activities such as radio, television and communication 
equipment; medical, precision and optical instruments; 
and other transport equipment.

The five fastest growing sectors over 2007–2011 
were basic metals; radio, television and communica-
tion  equipment;  office,  accounting  and  computing 

machinery; electrical machinery and apparatus; and 
other  transport  equipment  (Table  10.5).  In  2011 
China had become the clear global leader in four out 
of the five sectors, and second only to the United States 
in other transport equipment. The top three – China, 
the United States and Japan or the United Kingdom 
– in each sector concentrated between 51.3 percent 
and  70.4  percent  of  world  manufacturing.  Among 
industrializing countries India had become the larg-
est manufacturer in four out of the five fastest growing 
sectors, with Mexico leading the production of office, 
accounting and computing machinery.

China  was  the  first-  or  second-largest  manufac-
turer in the world in 20 out of 22 industrial sectors in

10“ Among industrializing countries China 

has become the uncontested leader in all 22 
industrial sectors, accounting for more than 
50 percent of industrializing countries’ total 
manufacturing value added in 18 of them

2011. Other industrializing countries among top-five 
leaders in global manufacturing included Argentina, 
Brazil, India, Indonesia, Mexico and Turkey.

Among  industrializing  countries  China  has 
become  the  uncontested  leader  in  all  22  industrial 
sectors, accounting for more than 50 percent of indus-
trializing countries’ total MVA in 18 of them. When 
China is excluded, India leads in four out of the five 
fastest growing sectors and is among the top three in 
13 industrial sectors, the same as Brazil. Mexico leads 
in one of the five fastest growing sectors and is among 
the  top  three  producers  in  nine  industrial  sectors, 
closely followed by Indonesia, Poland and Turkey.

Manufacturing value added by region
Global  MVA  grew  at  an  average  3.1  percent  a 
year  over  2002–2012,  reaching  $8,900  billion 
(Table 10.6). The impact of the 2008–2009 crisis on 
MVA was very different for industrialized and indus-
trializing countries: whereas industrialized countries 
registered an average decline of 1.0 percent annually 
over 2007–2012 and have yet to recover to pre-crisis 
production levels, industrializing countries did not 
experience a contraction and, except for a slowdown 
to 4.1 percent growth in 2009, each year after they 
expanded their MVA faster than the 5.3 percent aver-
age growth of 1992–2002. The relatively high MVA 
growth in industrializing countries over 2007–2012, 
6.2 percent a year on average, goes hand in hand with 
their  good  overall  economic  performance,  as  their 
GDP expanded by 5.1 percent annually over the same 
period.

But the manufacturing performance of individual 
countries and regions was not even, reflecting their dif-
ferent articulation into the world economy. Although 
all regions showed growth, the ratio was 6:1 between 
the fastest and slowest growing regions.

East  Asia  and  the  Pacific  scored  the  high-
est  growth,  9.1  percent  annually  over  2007–2012, 
mainly driven by manufacturing in China (9.9 per-
cent growth). A powerful stimulus programme put 
together  by  Chinese  authorities  in  2008  and  2009 
–  boosting  domestic  consumption  and  investment 

through  tax  cuts,  increasing  government  spending 
in infrastructure development, increasing affordable 
housing and loosening bank lending – succeeded in 
compensating  for  the  fall  in  external  demand  that 
came with the global recession and in sustaining high 
growth in manufacturing until 2012. Only two small 
economies  outperformed  Chinese  manufacturing 
over 2007–2012: Myanmar (14.2 percent) and Timor-
Leste (11.2 percent).

Most of the region’s countries profited from the 
dynamism of China, from widespread participation in 
regional production networks and from the adoption 
of stimulus packages of their own, scoring significant 
industrial growth throughout the period (Viet Nam, 
7.5 percent; Lao People’s Democratic Republic, 7.5 per-
cent; Cambodia, 7.2 percent; Indonesia, 4.9 percent). 
Only Samoa (–6.4 percent) and Brunei Darussalam 
(–0.4 percent) recorded yearly contractions in their 
MVA.

South  and  Central  Asia  registered  the  second-
highest growth in manufacturing over 2007–2012, at 
an average annual rate of 5.6 percent, and it was the 
only other region whose manufacturing production 
kept  growing  in  2009  despite  the  global  recession. 
It  benefited  from  proximity  to  China  and  produc-
tion networks in East Asia, and from the dynamism 
of Indian manufacturing, which in turn was fuelled 
by strong domestic demand and a shift towards more 
technologically complex products. Since 2009 India 
has become the second-largest manufacturer among 
industrializing  countries  and  ranks  ninth  in  the 
world. There were no great outliers in industrial per-
formance in the region, the countries with the fast-
est growing manufacturing sectors over 2007–2012 
being Bhutan (7.5 percent), Afghanistan (7.4 percent), 
Bangladesh  (7.1  percent),  India  (6.7  percent),  Sri 
Lanka (6.6 percent) and Tajikistan (5.8 percent). Only 
the Maldives (–3.0 percent) and the Islamic Republic 
of Iran (–0.1 percent) showed negative results.

In the Middle East and North Africa MVA grew 
by 3.5 percent over 2007–2012. The industrial perfor-
mance was mixed, with the bulk of countries show-
ing  moderate  growth  averaging  3–5  percent  a  year

thanks to strong domestic demand, though most of 
the growth took place only after 2009. The top per-
forming countries were Iraq (8.6 percent) and Oman 
(6.0  percent),  the  former  gradually  reconstructing 
after years of war. Cyprus (–2.1 percent), Azerbaijan 
(–2.0 percent), Lebanon (–1.2 percent) and Algeria 
(–0.7 percent) were unable to recover to pre-crisis lev-
els of manufacturing output.

Industrializing countries in Europe showed com-
bined  annualized  MVA  growth  of  3  percent  over 
2007–2012, which would seem to indicate a remark-
able  recovery  after  the  slump  in  2009.  There  was 

considerable  growth  in  Belarus  (7.6  percent)  and 
Poland (6.6 percent), pumped by fairly strong inter-
nal demand and a good export performance, in turn 
made possible by an upgrading of the domestic pro-
duction structure and a shift towards more high-tech 
products (EU 2012). Whereas Albania (2.5 percent) 
and Romania (1.4 percent) at least managed to recover 
the  ground  lost  during  the  2008–2009  recession, 
manufacturing in all other industrializing countries, 
mainly in Eastern Europe or the Balkans, stagnated 
or regressed drastically, emulating the general trend in 
the region’s industrialized countries.

Most  Sub-Saharan  countries  exhibited  robust 
MVA growth, with Ethiopia (8.6 percent), Equatorial 
Guinea (8.4 percent), Tanzania (8.2 percent), Uganda 
(8.2  percent)  and  Nigeria  (7.9  percent)  showing 
the  highest  rates.  Only  a  few  countries,  including 
Zimbabwe,  The  Gambia  and  the  Central  African 
Republic, saw a decline in their manufacturing out-
put over 2007–2012. The rather modest performance 
of South Africa (0.3 percent), the region’s largest pro-
ducer, accounted for the low overall growth. Amid ris-
ing domestic costs and low demand in its main export 
markets, South Africa has yet to find a way to har-
ness the potential benefits of manufacturing, which 
accounts for only 13 percent of jobs and 15 percent 
of GDP, figures much lower than in other emerging 
countries.

Latin  America  and  the  Caribbean’s  MVA 
expanded the least, by 1.4 percent, which explains how 
the region’s share in industrializing countries’ MVA 
fell from 21 percent in 2007 to 16.6 percent in 2012. 
Many countries in the region have the United States as 
the major destination of their manufactured exports 
and were hit hard by the crisis as they faced a sharp 
fall in demand for their products. The highest MVA 
growth  over  2007–2012  was  in  Peru  (5.7  percent), 
Ecuador  (4.8  percent)  and  Argentina  (4.5  percent), 

as  these  countries  benefited  from  strong  domestic 
demand. Other Latin American countries had more 
modest results; most Caribbean countries saw a con-
traction of their manufacturing output.

The  industrial  performance  of  the  least  devel-
oped countries over 2007–2012 was strong. Not only 
did they score the highest average annual growth as 
a group (6.7 percent; see Table 10.6) but many least 
developed  countries  (Myanmar,  Timor-Leste,  Lao 
People’s  Democratic  Republic,  Cambodia,  Bhutan, 
Afghanistan,  Bangladesh,  Ethiopia,  Tanzania  and 
Uganda) topped their regions’ MVA growth. Some of 
these countries seem to be integrating with interna-
tional production networks in their regions and catch-
ing up after years of isolation and domestic instabil-
ity. Others are benefiting from preferential access to 
industrialized countries. And all seem to be benefiting 
from the growth of the Chinese market.

10Chapter 11
Trends in manufactured exports

A feature of the current organization of manufactur-
ing is the increased use of international production 
networks to carry out different stages of the produc-
tion  process  across  borders,  made  possible  by  large 
scales of production, advances in technology (espe-
cially  micro-electronics)  and  affordable  transport 
costs.

From simple products such as garments and shoes 
to  complex  products  such  as  aircraft  and  automo-
biles, manufactured parts and components are likely 
to  be  produced  by  numerous  suppliers  in  different 
countries, shipped around several times before finally 
being incorporated into the end product. One extreme 
example is the Airbus, which relies on a network of 
some 1,500 suppliers in 30 countries.

The  result  of  this  production  sharing  has  been 
a  larger  increase  in  trade  than  the  corresponding 
increase in manufacturing value added (MVA). World 
exports grew 6.4 percent annually between 2006 and 
2011 to reach $16.7 trillion in 2011, more than 80 per-
cent of it manufactured products (Table 11.1). In the 
same period world output expanded on average by just 
1.5 percent a year, as many countries were hit hard by 
the economic crisis in 2008–2009.

Industrialized  economies  have  the  bulk  of  the 
world’s  manufactured  exports,  but  industrializing 
countries have been increasing their world share since 
the 1990s.1

Global trends
In  2011  world  manufactured  exports  peaked  at 
$13,469  billion,  growing  faster  than  manufactur-
ing  value  added  and  GDP  over  2007–2011  (see 
Table 11.1). They recovered fully from the contraction 
that followed the crisis, due mainly to the expansion 
in exports from large industrializing countries such as 
China and India. Exports of primary products grew 
nearly twice as fast over the same period, often fuelled 
by higher prices and strong demand from fast-growing 
countries.

Manufactured exports from industrialized coun-
tries grew just 3.7 percent annually over 2007–2011, 
reaching $9,483 billion in 2011, as they struggled to 
recover  from  the  dip  in  economic  activity  brought 
about by the crisis (Table 11.2; see also Table 11.4). 
Manufactured exports from industrializing countries 
grew 10.5 percent annually over the same period, to a 
peak of $3,985 billion in 2011.

The  higher  dynamism  of  industrializing  econo-
mies is also reflected in the increase in their share in 
world  manufactured  exports,  from  13.9  percent  in 
1997 to 29.6 percent in 2011 (Figure 11.1). It was the 
emerging economies that accounted for most of this 
increase, their world share more than doubling from 
12.3 percent in 1997 to 27.1 percent in 2011. Given 
current  trends  and  growth  in  network  trade,  it  is 
expected that more manufacturing activities will be

located to industrializing countries so as to benefit 
from lower production costs.

Together,  the  combined  manufactured  exports 
of the largest country in each industrializing region 
–  China,  India,  Mexico,  Poland,  South  Africa  and 
Turkey – accounted for 67.5 percent of the total for 
industrializing countries in 2011, up from 59.9 per-
cent in 2002 and 55.1 percent in 1997, confirming the 
higher dynamism of the larger countries and a worry-
ing widening gap with the smaller economies.

Around  60  percent  of  world  manufactured 
exports consist of medium- and high-tech products, 
such  as  pharmaceuticals,  plastics,  office  machinery, 

telecommunications  equipment,  electrical  machin-
ery and appliances, road vehicles and other industrial 
machinery and parts (Figure 11.2).2 After a peak of 
26 percent in 2000, the share of high-tech products 
in  world  manufactured  exports  receded  to  21  per-
cent  in  2011.  A  half-hearted  investment  climate  in 
high-income countries could be a factor behind this 
weak  result.  While  the  world  shares  of  exports  of 
medium- and low-tech products have been gradually

activities in industrializing countries has translated 
into a growing need for materials, while the higher 
incomes  and  rising  urban  middle  class  in  many  of 
these countries pushed up demand for processed food.

Advances in automation, coupled with tight qual-
ity control by production networks’ leading firms and 
the upgrading of workforce skills, have made possible a 
large-scale relocation of manufacturing of medium- and 
high-tech products to industrializing countries, altering 
the technological complexity of their exports greatly.3 
Over 2006–2011 industrializing countries expanded 
their share in world exports of medium- and high-tech 
products by 6.2 percent annually while their share in 
world exports of resource-based and low-tech products 
grew at the slower rate of 2.9 percent a year. In the same 
period industrialized countries saw their correspond-
ing shares in world manufactured exports decline by 
1.6 percent and 1.4 percent a year (Figure 11.3).

Of  the  20  most  dynamic  manufactured  export 
products (products with the highest average annual 
growth rates) over 2007–2011, 11 were resource-based 
products (Table 11.3).4 Resource-endowed industrial-
izing countries such as Argentina, Brazil, Indonesia, 
Saudi Arabia, South Africa and Ukraine profited from 
the fast growth that was fuelled by high demand from 
the construction, metal working and food processing 
industries in China and India. At the other end of the 
spectrum, seven of the fastest growing manufactured

exports  were  medium-  and  high-tech  products  in 
industrialized  countries  as  well  as  in  China  (and 
other Asian industrializing countries such as India, 
Thailand and Viet Nam). One of the major markets 
for these medium- and high-tech products, besides the 
traditional high-income Organisation for Economic 
Co-operation and Development countries, is China 
itself:  in  2011  it  received  63  percent  of  all  optical 
instrument exports.

Exports of the top four products (iron ores, vegeta-
ble fat and oils, fertilizers and office machines) grew 
more than 20 percent a year on average. By total export 
value, one resource-based product, petroleum oils (not 
crude oil), headed the list in 2011 with $893 billion, 
followed by one medium-tech item, ships, boats and 
floating structures ($182 billion), and one high-tech 
product,  medicinal  and  pharmaceutical  products 
other than medicaments ($153 billion).

Industrializing countries’ role in world 
manufactured exports
All industrializing regions have increased their share 
in world manufacturing exports since 1997, but not 

all countries and regions have fared equally well. The 
surge in industrializing countries’ exports of manu-
factures since the turn of the century is largely attrib-
utable to China’s emergence as a large manufacturer 
and exporter of many of these products. Its exports of 
manufactured goods grew on average by 22.1 percent 
a year over 2002–2011, twice as fast as the world’s rate 
of 11.0 percent. Having become the world’s largest 
exporter of manufactures in 2008, China improved its 
lead further, achieving exports of $1,825 billion and a 
world market share of 16.6 percent in 2011.

In  line  with  its  position  as  leading  manufactur-
ing region among industrializing countries, East Asia 
and the Pacific accounted for the largest export share 
in  2011:  56.0  percent  of  industrializing  countries’ 
manufactured exports came from the region, up from 
44.1  percent  in  2000  (Figure  11.4).  A  considerable 
proportion of these exports respond to intra-regional 
trade, in turn driven by specialization and increased 
component trade within global production networks. 
But despite the resulting stronger economic integra-
tion among the region’s countries, their dependence on 
the global economy remains very high, making them

particularly vulnerable to the international business 
cycle (Athukorala 2011; Gangnes and van Asche 2010).
Initially,  China  was  concentrated  in  manufac-
turing low-tech, labour-intensive assembly products, 
mainly as an outsourcing option for East Asian pro-
ducers exporting to the world market in the 1980s 
and 1990s. Following its accession to the World Trade 
Organization in 2001, China moved massively into 
the production and export of more complex, medium- 
and high-tech manufactures with such success that 
in 2011 it accounted for 81.7 percent of the region’s 
exports (Figure 11.5). Of China’s top 10 export prod-
ucts in 2012, 6 were high-tech manufactures, total-
ling $446.7 billion and representing 22.8 percent of 
the country’s exports. They included computer, tele-
communications  and  office  equipment;  diodes  and 

transistors; and optical instruments. Three other were 
medium-tech engineering products (UN 2013a). The 
main destinations for these technologically complex 
manufactures were the United States, industrialized 
economies in Asia (Hong Kong SAR China, Japan, 
Republic  of  Korea  and  Singapore),  the  European 
Union (EU) and India.

The  second-largest  exporter  of  manufactured 
products, Latin America and the Caribbean, could 
not keep up with the fast expansion of trade in Asia 
and saw its share in industrializing countries’ manu-
factured exports drop from 28.8 percent in 2000 to 
16.0 percent in 2011. Mexico and Brazil were the major 
actors,  accounting  for  68.2  percent  of  the  region’s 
manufactured exports in 2011, but showed two pat-
terns of integration with international markets.

Mexico, the larger exporter of the two, is heavily 
exposed to the North American market (80.7 percent 
of total exports in 2012), and its exports were severely 

hit by the contraction in 2008–2009. Of Mexico’s top 
10 export products in 2012, two were high-tech man-
ufactures (telecommunications and computer equip-
ment), representing 9.6 percent of total exports, and 
five were medium-tech products (passenger and goods 
vehicles and their parts, TV receivers, and electrical 
distribution equipment), representing 24.2 percent.

By contrast, Brazil had only one high-tech product 
(aircraft, 0.2 percent of total exports) and no medium-
tech products among its top 10 exports in 2012. A 
textbook example of a resource-rich industrializing 
country, Brazil concentrated its top 10 exports in 2012 
in five primary products (23.4 percent of total exports) 
and four resource-based manufactures (iron ore, heavy 
petroleum oil, sugar, and pulp, representing 22.0 per-
cent). Its major export destinations (China, the United 
States, Argentina, the EU and Japan) accounted for 
only 48.0 percent of total exports. Different export 
patterns gave different results too: over 2003–2011 
Mexico’s exports of manufactures grew 7.5 percent a 
year while Brazil’s expanded 16.3 percent a year.

Led by Poland, the largest economy in the region, 
Europe  has  maintained  its  share  in  industrializing 
countries’ exports at around 10 percent throughout

11“ In 2011, 48.7 percent ($6,472 billion) 

of total manufactured exports was from 
one industrialized country to another

2000–2011. While keeping their traditional export 
markets, mostly in Eastern Europe, some countries 
have shown benefits of joining the EU and succeeded 
in securing new markets for their exports of manu-
factures. Over the last few years the downside of this 
approach has been sluggish export and output growth 
as Industrialized Europe struggled with the repercus-
sions of the global economic and euro crises.

Poland accounted for 41.0 percent of the region’s 
exports  of  manufactures  in  2011,  and  although  its 
main export market is the EU (55.6 percent of total 
exports), it has a fairly diversified export base concen-
trated in medium-tech products. Its top 10 exports in 
2012 represented only 24.2 percent of the export total 
and  included  five  medium-tech  manufactures  (pas-
senger and goods vehicles and their parts, TV receiv-
ers, seats, combustion engines, and ships and floating 
structures), representing 14.3 percent of total exports, 
and  one  high-tech  product  (computer  equipment), 
representing 1.7 percent.

Industrializing  country  shares  of  manufactured 
exports  for  the  Middle  East  and  North  Africa  and 
South and Central Asia remained below 10 percent in 
2012, despite fast export growth of 15.1 percent and 
19.7 percent a year, respectively. India accounted for 
77 percent of South and Central Asia’s manufactured 
exports in 2012 and their growth over 2002–2011 – 
22.0 percent a year – was impressive, nearly matching 
the expansion in China. Of India’s top 10 exports in 
2012, three were medium- or high-tech manufactures 
(motor vehicles, medicines and communications equip-
ment), representing 5.7 percent of total exports; low-
tech jewellery exports accounted for 6.3 percent; and 
three resource-based products (non-crude petroleum 
oils, diamonds and iron ores) made up 26.8 percent.

Turkey, the main exporter of manufactures in the 
Middle East and North Africa with a 43.8 percent 
share, also exhibited a diversified structure among its 
top 10 exports: medium-tech products (motor vehicles 
and their parts, and insulated cables) accounted for 
10.0 percent of total exports, low-tech exports (gar-
ments and jewellery) came to 8.8 percent and resource-
based exports and gold represented 11.2 percent.

Manufactured exports from Sub-Saharan Africa 
also  grew  quickly,  at  a  14.5  percent  annual  average 
over 2002–2011, but this was not enough to prevent 
a  decline  in  the  region’s  share  from  3.5  percent  to 
2.8 percent of industrializing countries’ manufactured 
exports  over  the  period.  Besides  primary  products 
the region was concentrated mainly in the export of 
resource-based and medium-tech manufactures, pri-
marily motor vehicles and their parts, basic chemicals, 
and basic iron and steel produced in South Africa.

To appraise better a region’s export performance 
in  terms  of  strength  and  technological  complexity, 
the evolution of world market shares by technologi-
cal level is examined (Figure 11.6). Over 2006–2011 
East  Asia  and  the  Pacific,  South  and  Central  Asia 
and  Europe  increased  their  world  market  shares  of 
resource-based  and  low-tech  products;  their  shares 
of medium- and high-tech products increased nearly 
twice as fast. Latin America and the Caribbean’s share 
of resourced-based and low-tech products stagnated 
and its share of medium- and high-tech products grew 
marginally. The Middle East and North Africa lost 
world  market  share  in  resource-based  and  low-tech 
manufactured exports but made considerable gains in 
that of medium- and high-tech products. Sub-Saharan 
Africa’s  world  market  share  of  resource-based  and 
low-tech products grew much faster than its share of 
medium- and high-tech products.

Industrializing countries’ 
manufactured export markets
The largest share of world manufactured exports is 
mainly accounted for by trade between industrialized 
countries. In 2011, 48.7 percent ($6,472 billion) of 
total manufactured exports was from one industrial-
ized country to another. By contrast, exports of manu-
factures among industrializing countries represented 
a minor fraction of the total, 9.1 percent ($1,208 bil-
lion). But although both trade flows increased over 
2006–2011, manufactured exports among industri-
alizing countries did so at nearly 20 percent a year 
(Figure  11.7).  Expansion  of  global  production  net-
works  incorporating  new  locations  and  involving

increasingly more complex goods, fast liberalization 
of intraregional trade in certain areas and develop-
ment of closer commercial ties among industrializing 

countries, combined with a rising demand for con-
sumer and capital goods in these countries, explain the 
rapid export growth.

11“ By 2011 trade in manufactured 

exports had fully recovered, setting a 
new record of $13,469 billion, 11 percent 
higher than the 2008 peak

Manufactured trade flows between the groups of 
industrialized and industrializing countries accounted 
together  for  42.1  percent  of  total  world  exports  of 
manufactures and grew at comparable rates of around 
11–12 percent over 2006–2011. But despite expand-
ing their export share faster, industrializing countries 
showed a trade deficit with industrialized countries 
($274 billion) in 2011.

With  the  largest  and  best  intertwined  produc-
tion  networks  having  developed  in  East  Asia  and 
the Pacific, it is this region driving the expansion in 
manufactured export trade between industrializing

partners, but their share had been declining in favour 
of  exports  to  industrializing  countries  even  before 
the 2008–2009 crisis (Figure 11.9). The growing pro-
cessed trade (import of foreign parts and components 
for assembly and subsequent export as final goods) 
in industrializing countries, particularly in East Asia 
and the Pacific, reinforces this trend. In addition, tra-
ditional commercial ties and more familiarity with 
the demand, tastes and standards of countries in the 
same region help explain that they, as a group, are the 
second  destination  of  manufactured  exports  in  all 
regions but South and Central Asia, where trade with 
East Asia and the Pacific is more important.

The recovery of global manufactured 
exports
World  manufactured  exports  had  grown  15.6  per-
cent annually over 2003–2007, reaching more than 
$12,120  billion  in  2008,  with  the  growth  rate  in 
industrializing economies (23.2 percent) far greater 
than that in industrialized economies (13.6 percent; 
Table  11.4).  After  that,  recession  set  in  the  United 
States, the EU and Japan, affecting most industrial-
izing  countries  through  reduced  demand  for  their 
exports and lower migrant remittances, investment 
flows, tourism income and even development aid. The 
severe  contraction  in  manufactured  exports  world-
wide (–21.5 percent) in 2009 hit all industrializing 
countries, albeit with varying force. The most stricken 
regions  were  the  Middle  East  and  North  Africa 
(–26.3 percent) and Europe (–25.9 percent), as these 
regions are important trading partners of the EU, but 
also  Sub-Saharan  Africa  (–23.6  percent)  and  Latin 
America and the Caribbean (–22.3 percent).

By 2011 trade in manufactured exports had fully 
recovered,  setting  a  new  record  of  $13,469  billion, 
11 percent higher than the 2008 peak. Despite their 
smaller share in manufacturing output and exports 
compared with industrialized economies, it is indus-
trializing economies that are behind the recent revival 
in trade. Of the $1,349 billion additional exports in 
2011  (relative  to  2008),  industrializing  economies 
accounted for $846 billion (62.7 percent), equivalent

to a growth rate of 8.3 percent a year, while industri-
alized economies only registered $503 billion more 
manufactured exports (37.3 percent), or a growth rate 
of 1.8 percent a year over 2008–2011. This is as much a 
reflection of overall economic performance – because 
industrialized  countries  are  still  struggling  to  put 
their economies back on their feet while most of the 
industrializing world was already up and running in 
2010 – as it is a sign of the intensification of network 
trade and the incorporation of more industrializing 
countries into existing production networks (Hanson 
2012).

Manufactured export performance of each region 
was  broadly  in  line  with  the  performance  of  their 
respective major countries (Figure 11.10). East Asia 
and  the  Pacific  and  South  and  Central  Asia  –  led 
by China and India – recorded new highs in 2010 
and  consolidated  their  lead  in  2011.  Sub-Saharan 
Africa also exceeded its prior performance in 2010, 
but the main economy in the region, South Africa, 

took  longer  to  recover.  Industrializing  Europe  and 
Latin America and the Caribbean needed two years 
to regain their grip on manufactured exports, as did 
Poland and Mexico. Only the Middle East and North 
Africa stood in 2011 at the same level of exports as 
before the crisis.

Manufactured  export  growth  in  South  and 
Central  Asia  (averaging  18.4  percent  a  year  over 
2008–2011) was helped by a surge in exports from 
India, especially from the newly established special 
economic zones (SEZs; spurred by the SEZ Act 2005). 
Although 19 SEZs existed previously, new rules were 
put in place and 154 new SEZs became operational 
after 2006. Exports of Indian SEZs boomed from a 
meagre $2.5 billion in (fiscal year) 2003/04 to about 
$60 billion in 2011/12 (SEZ India 2013). India con-
tributed with $96 billion of additional manufactured 
exports in 2011 (from 2008); this was similar to the 
$102 billion contribution of all of Latin America and 
the  Caribbean  but  coming  from  a  manufacturing

sector that was only 40 percent the size. The expan-
sion of manufactured exports from the other coun-
tries in the region was also fast, as they too, like India, 
intensified their ties with countries in the growing 
East  Asia  and  the  Pacific  region,  and  experienced 
reductions in their exports shares to the EU and the 
United States.

The upturn in East Asia and the Pacific was largely 
led  by  China,  which  accounted  for  $455  billion  of 
the new manufactured exports in 2011 (from 2008). 
Although China’s main export markets were still in 
the mire, it seems that increased competitiveness and 

lower prices may have helped in securing new exports 
and even influenced decisions to relocate production 
from more expensive sites in industrialized countries. 
Other emerging economies in the region specialize in 
key final products and in different stages of compo-
nent manufacturing, supplying China or industrial-
ized economies in the region with inputs for further 
incorporation into final products.

The  pace  of  recovery  of  manufactured  exports 
in  Sub-Saharan  Africa  (8.0  percent  annual  growth 
over 2008–2011), Latin America and the Caribbean 
(6.0  percent),  and  Europe  (4.2  percent)  was  more

products  gave  them  a  competitive  edge  in  the  con-
text of restrained spending in their traditional export 
markets, the EU and the United States. Bangladesh, 
the largest economy in the group, obtains more than 
75 percent of its export earnings from the export of 
knitted and woven garments and saw its exports of 
these products increase steadily after the crisis. Other 
least  developed  countries,  such  as  Cambodia,  the 
Lao People’s Democratic Republic and Myanmar, are 
slowly being incorporated into their regional produc-
tion networks to capitalize on their factor advantages, 
while other countries have benefited from high prices 
for their resource-based manufactures.

Despite  progress,  the  least  developed  countries 
remain fragile, as most of them concentrate on a few 
products that are prone to market volatility, some of 
them are torn by war or political instability, and gen-
erally they have weak infrastructure to support manu-
facturing exports.

moderate. The first two regions have a strong pres-
ence  of  resource-based  manufactures,  whose  prices 
have been on the rise due to strong demand growth in 
large industrializing countries. The growth in manu-
factured exports in Industrializing Europe was instead 
helped by the accession of Bulgaria and Romania to 
the  EU  in  2007.  Middle  East  and  North  African 
countries  do  not  enjoy  tariff-free  access  to  the  EU 
and have been unable to surpass their manufactured 
exports peak of 2008.

Labour intensity

To determine the level of labour intensity, employment 
per value added was estimated for 18 manufacturing 
industries at two income levels of $5,000 and $20,000 
GDP per capita, as the labour intensity changes along 
income level. If an industry’s labour intensity is higher 
than the median of 18 manufacturing industries at 
both income levels, it is considered labour intensive; if 
an industry’s labour intensity is lower than the median 
at both income levels, it is considered relatively capital 
intensive.

Labour-intensive  industries  (ordered  from  the 

industry of the highest labour intensity):
•  Wearing apparel.
•  Textiles.
•  Wood products.
•  Fabricated metals.
•  Food and beverages.

Capital-intensive  industries  (ordered  from  the 

industry of the highest capital intensity):
•  Coke and refined petroleum.
•  Tobacco.
•  Chemicals.
•  Printing and publishing.
•  Electrical machinery and apparatus.

Annex 5
Technological classification of 
manufacturing value added data

To  compute  the  share  of  medium-  and  high- 
technology activities in manufacturing value added, 
the  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and 
Development technology classification (OECD 2005) 
was used (Table A5.1).

For  Niger  and  Zimbabwe,  the  classification  in 
Table A5.2 was used because data were available only 
in ISIC Revision 2.

For  this  classification,  medium-  and  high-tech-
nology activities were combined. The sector shares of 
value added were then calculated in relation to the 
total for manufacturing subsectors.

value added, ISIC Revision 3

“ Structural change through the 
development of manufacturing is 
essential to any developing country 
for job creation, poverty reduction 
and sustained development. 
UNIDO’s Industrial Development 
Report 2013 provides careful 
theoretical reviews, solid empirical 
evidence and practical policy 
advice for how to facilitate the 
development of manufacturing in 
developing countries. I strongly 
recommend this report to anyone 
who is interested in finding out 
a path to achieve prosperity in 
developing countries.” 
Justin Yifu Lin, Professor, National School 
of Development, Peking University
Former Chief Economist and Senior Vice 
President, The World Bank

“ Structural change is the core 
of sustainable development. 
Continuous upgrading of 
manufacturing industries offers 
opportunities for growth, productive 
employment and the efficient use 
of resources. UNIDO’s Industrial 
Development Report 2013 provides 
ample evidence of how and why 
structural change works and 
presents sustainable paths to 
industrialization. It is an extremely 
valuable companion for policy-
makers dealing with manufacturing 
upgrading and employment 
generation.”
Kandeh K. Yumkella, Chairman, UN Energy, 
Former Director General of UNIDO

“ Based on a comprehensive and 
sophisticated analysis of the role of 
manufacturing in structural change, 
UNIDO’s Industrial Development 
Report 2013 provides an insightful 
discussion on the evolution and 
the determinants of economic 
transformation. The Report’s 
findings have valuable policy 
implications for both economic 
practitioners and academics who 
are interested in the key role that 
a vibrant manufacturing sector 
can play in achieving inclusive 
and sustainable economic 
development.”
