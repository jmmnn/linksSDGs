World Economic and Social Survey 2011: The Great Green Technological Transformation
Nothing short of a technological revolution on the scale of the first industrial revolution will be required 
to meet the challenge of sustainable development.  Enormous improvements in human welfare have 
taken place over the past two centuries, but at a lasting cost of degradation of our natural environment. 
Continuation  along  established  economic  growth  paths  means  that  the  Earth’s  capacity  to  ensure 
human welfare and serve as a sink for the waste and pollution generated in the creation of that welfare 
will be exceeded.

The World Economic and Social Survey 2011 analyses the challenges and options involved in shifting 
to  a  “green  economy”  based  on  more  efficient  and  renewable  energy  technologies,  transforming 
agricultural technologies so as to guarantee food security without further degrading land and water 
resources, and utilizing technology to adapt to climate change and reduce risks to human populations 
from natural hazards.

The needed global technological transformation will have to be completed in less than 40 years, that 
is, twice as fast as it took to accomplish previous major technological transitions. Swift action in 
creating a global technology development and sharing regime, considerable upgrading of public sector 
capabilities and significant adjustments in multilateral trade and financing mechanisms will be needed 
in order to renew Earth’s capacity to sustain human life and enable developing countries to undertake 
the  necessary  technological  transformation  —  one  that  permits  them  to  realize  their  aspirations 
towards growth and poverty reduction.

The Department of Economic and Social Affairs of the United Nations Secretariat is a vital 
interface between global policies in the economic, social and environmental spheres and 
national action. The Department works in three main interlinked areas: (i) it compiles, 
generates and analyses a wide range of economic, social and environmental data and 
information on which States Members of the United Nations draw to review common 
problems and to take stock of policy options; (ii) it facilitates the negotiations of Member 
States in many intergovernmental bodies on joint courses of action to address ongoing or 
emerging global challenges; and (iii) it advises interested Governments on the ways and 
means of translating policy frameworks developed in United Nations conferences and 
summits into programmes at the country level and, through technical assistance, helps build 
national capacities.

Preface

iii

The world faces important decisions on how we generate energy and manage our natural 
assets—choices with implications that will reverberate for generations to come. Against a 
backdrop of a rising global population and unceasing pressure on the natural environment, 
this  2011  edition  of  the  World  Economic  and  Social  Survey  can  guide  our  collective 
efforts to achieve a much-needed technological transformation to a greener, cleaner global 
economy.

The past two decades have seen considerable economic growth, particularly 
in the emerging economies. Hundreds of millions of people have risen from poverty—in 
Asia, Latin America and, increasingly, in Africa.

But with global population expected to reach 9 billion by 2050, we need to 
accelerate the pace of productive economic expansion. At the same time, this growth must 
be balanced with respect for the human and natural capital that is its foundation, lest 
we  risk  profound  and  potentially  irreversible  changes  in  the  planet’s  ability  to  sustain 
progress. 

Rather than viewing growth and sustainability as competing goals on a collision 
course, we must see them as complementary and mutually supportive imperatives. This 
becomes possible when we embrace a low-carbon, resource-efficient, pro-poor economic 
model.

A  comprehensive  global  energy  transition  is  critical  to  this  process.  With 
data,  analysis  and  careful  projections,  this  Survey  illustrates  the  feasibility  of  such 
a  transformation.  It  also  highlights  the  hurdles,  and  outlines  what  will  be  required  of 
governments and the international community as a whole to make the most of available 
green technologies—and to generate new applications and inventions that meet the needs 
of countries at different levels of development.

The Survey also addresses the challenge of feeding a global population that 
will be nearly 35 per cent larger in 2050 than it is today—looking back at the first green 
revolution in agriculture, and ahead to future models that can be far more effective in 
improving the global food supply while protecting its sources.

Green economic thinking can unleash the government policies and business 
opportunities that will power sustainable growth, reduce poverty and protect our natural 
resources. By providing a wealth of information, insights and practical recommendations, 
this Survey can help advance the global debate on the critical role that a transformation 
in technology can play in ushering in a greener future. Its publication is especially timely 
as the world prepares for next year’s Rio+20 United Nations Conference on Sustainable 
Development, and I commend it to policy-makers, non-governmental partners, business 
executives and concerned individuals everywhere who can help realize this shared goal.

Overview

The green technological transformation

“Business as usual” is not an option

While humankind has made enormous progress in improving material welfare over the 
past two centuries, this progress has come at the lasting cost of degradation of our natu-
ral environment. About half of the forests that covered the earth are gone, groundwater 
resources are being depleted and contaminated, enormous reductions in biodiversity have 
already  taken  place  and,  through  increased  burning  of  fossil  fuels,  the  stability  of  the 
planet’s climate is being threatened by global warming. In order for populations in devel-
oping countries to achieve a decent living standard, especially the billions who currently 
still live in conditions of abject poverty, and the additional 2 billion people who will have 
been added to the world’s population by mid-century—much greater economic progress 
will be needed.

Continuation along previously trodden economic growth pathways will fur-
ther exacerbate the pressures exerted on the world’s resources and natural environment, 
which would approach limits where livelihoods were no longer sustainable. Business as 
usual is thus not an option. Yet, even if we stop global engines of growth now, the deple-
tion and pollution of our natural environment would still continue because of existing 
consumption patterns and production methods. Hence, there is an urgent need to find 
new development pathways which would ensure environmental sustainability and reverse 
ecological destruction, while managing to provide, now and in the future, a decent liveli-
hood for all of humankind.

The green economy as the new paradigm?

To achieve this goal, a radically new economic strategy will be needed. Economic decision-
making, by Governments and private agents alike, will need to focus on ways to strength-
en, rather than endanger, environmental sustainability. The “green economy” has been 
promoted as the key concept in this regard—the concept that embodies the promise of a 
new development paradigm, whose application has the potential to ensure the preservation 
of the earth’s ecosystem along new economic growth pathways while contributing at the 
same time to poverty reduction.

There is no unique definition of the green economy, but, however imprecisely 
defined, there is broad agreement on the basic idea underpinning it, namely, that enhanc-
ing economic growth, social progress and environmental stewardship can be complemen-
tary strategic objectives and that the need for possible trade-offs among them en route to 
their realization can be overcome. In this sense, the focus of the concept is fully consistent 
with that of the sustainable development concept eleborated by the United Nations, which 
perceives the economic, social and environmental dimensions as the three pillars of de-
velopment and which stresses the importance of intergenerational equity in development, 
that is, ensuring that meeting the needs of the present generation does not compromise the 
ability of future generations to meet their own needs.

Further, the green economy concept is based on the conviction that the ben-
efits of investing in environmental sustainability outweigh the cost of not doing so, as 
much as it outweighs the cost of having to protect ecosystems from the damages caused by 
a “non-green” (brown) economy.

A technological revolution is needed …

Growth of the world population, per capita income, energy and resource use, waste and 
the production of pollutants (including greenhouse gas emissions) have all increased ex-
ponentially since the first industrial revolution. A depiction of these increases assumes the 
shape of a hockey stick (see figure O.1 (a) to (d)). The related increase in the level of human 
activity is threatening to surpass the limits of the Earth’s capacity as a source and sink.

The  objective  of  the  green  economy  is  to  ensure  that  those  limits  are  not 
crossed. One option for achieving this would be to limit income growth, as it would also, 
given existing production methods, limit the growth of resource use, waste and pollutants. 
However, doing so would complicate efforts to meet the development objective and would 
thus not be in the interest of developing countries, which are home to the vast majority 
of the world’s population. Reducing population growth could be another option; but this 
could be achieved more effectively by improving living standards. Reducing non-renewable 
energy and resource use, reducing waste and pollutants, and reversing land degradation 
and biodiversity losses would then seem key to greening the economy.

A  fundamental  technological  overhaul  will  be  required.  Technologies  will 
need to undergo drastic changes so as to become more efficient in the use of energy and 
other resources and minimize the generation of harmful pollutants. At present, 90 per

type of production being responsible for about 60 per cent of carbon dioxide (CO2) emis-
sions. According to the more cautious scenario, for CO2 equivalent concentrations to be 
stabilized at 450 parts per million (consistent with the target of stabilizing global warming 
at a 2º C temperature increase from pre-industrial levels), the use of fossil fuels would 
need to drop by 80 per cent by mid-century. Reducing the energy use and greenhouse 
gas  emissions  associated  with  growing  and  increasingly  urban  populations  will  require 
drastic changes in consumption patterns, transportation systems, residential and building 
infrastructure, and water and sanitation systems.

Modern agriculture, which underpins global food security, currently contrib-
utes  about  14  per  cent  of  greenhouse  gas  emissions,  and  the  land-use  and  water  man-
agement related thereto are not sustainable in many parts of the world. Deforestation is 
contributing an estimated 17 per cent of global emissions, while causing the loss of habitat, 
species and biodiversity in general. As with regard to energy, technologies do exist that are 
known to ensure more sustainable farming and forestry management, prevention of land 
erosion and strict limits on water pollution by agriculture, but a great deal more innova-
tion and knowledge sharing is needed to allow for their adaptation to local conditions. At 
the same time, however, inasmuch as nearly 1 billion people are undernourished and are 
facing serious food insecurity, global food production would need to increase by between 
70 and 100 per cent from present levels by 2050 in order to feed a growing population. 
Thus, there is an urgent need to make agricultural production environmentally sustain-
able, while at the same time substantially raising productivity. It is hard to imagine how 
this can be attained without a major overhaul of existing production systems, technologies 
and supporting infrastructure.

Overview

ix

The incidence of natural disasters has increased fivefold since the 1970s. This 
increase can, with a fair degree of certainty, be attributed in part to climate change in-
duced by human activity. Deforestation, degradation of natural coastal protection and 
poor infrastructure have increased the likelihood that weather shocks will turn into hu-
man disasters, especially in the least developed countries. Reducing disaster risk will then 
entail significant technological and social change, including rebuilding of infrastructure 
and  better  land-use  and  water  management  in  vulnerable  areas  with  vulnerable  social 
groups fully taking part in decision-making processes related to the implementation of 
systems of community resilience to climate change and disasters.

… which will be like no other

Many of the technologies needed for a green economy are already available, as evidenced, 
for example, by the range of options for generating renewable energy (wind, solar power 
and biofuels, among others), technologies for carbon capture and more efficient energy use, 
techniques to replace non-biodegradable resources, and sustainable farming and forestry 
techniques, as well as technologies to render coastlines and infrastructure less prone to 
natural disasters. These options offer readily usable starting points. The main challenges to 
jump-starting the shift to a green economy lie in how to further improve these techniques, 
adapt them to specific local and sectoral needs, scale up the applications so as to bring 
down significantly their costs, and provide incentives and mechanisms that will facilitate 
their diffusion and knowledge-sharing. Meeting these challenges successfully is easier said 
than done.

As so many of the components of existing economic systems are “locked into” 
the use of non-green and non-sustainable technologies, much is at stake in terms of the 
high cost of moving out of those technologies. Developing countries, especially low-income 
ones, with relatively low rates of electricity usage, may be able to “leapfrog” into electricity 
generation based on renewable forms of primary energy, for instance. The question is how 
to enable those countries to access, utilize and, above all, afford green technologies.

Further innovation and scaling up are also needed to drive down unit costs. 
Technologies will need to be “transferred”’ and made accessible, since most innovation 
takes place in the developed countries and private corporations in those countries are the 
main  owners  of  the  intellectual  property  rights  covering  most  green  technologies.  The 
new technologies will also need to be locked into new production processes. This would 
imply improving much existing infrastructure and actively promoting green technologies 
and industries. Consequently, the technological revolution for a green economy will be 
fundamentally different from previous revolutions—in three ways.

First, it will have to take place within a specific and limited time period. Given 
existing pressures on our ecosystem, the goal would need to be achieved within the next 
three to four decades—a huge challenge, given that diffusion of technologies is a slow 
process. Previous technological revolutions typically required a substantially longer period 
of time than that available now to accomplish the required green technology revolution.
Second, Governments will have to assume a much more central role, the lim-
ited time frame being one key reason for this. Under current circumstances, there needs to 
be an acceleration of technological innovation and diffusion, which is unlikely to occur if 
they are left to market forces. Equally important is the fact that the natural environment is 

x

World Economic and Social Survey 2011

a public good and not “priced” by the market. Markets for green technologies do exist, but 
they are just developing, created through government policy. Governments will also have 
to play a key role in promoting further research on and development of green technologies 
and their diffusion, inasmuch as the benefits will accrue to whole societies. In addition, 
since at present existing brown technologies are locked into the entire economic system, 
a radical shift to green technologies will mean improving, adjusting and replacing much 
existing  infrastructure  and  other  invested  capital.  Such  transformations  will  be  costly 
and necessitate large-scale long-term financing, which is unlikely to be mobilized in full 
through private initiative and will require government support and incentives. Thus, not 
only will strong technology policies be needed, but they must go hand in hand with active 
industrial and educational policies aimed at inducing the necessary changes in infrastruc-
ture and production processes.

Third,  since  the  environmental  challenges  are  global,  the  green  technologi-
cal revolution will need to be facilitated by intense international cooperation. The global 
dimension is most obvious in the case of climate change, but problems of food insecurity 
and  deforestation  have  significant  cross-border  effects  as  well,  stemming,  for  example, 
from  food  price  instability  and  greenhouse  gas  emissions.  Through  international  trade 
and investment, incomes and consumption in one country are linked to the ecological 
footprints left in the country of production. Multilateral environmental agreements, trade 
and investment rules, financing facilities and intellectual property rights regimes would all 
need to be aligned so as to facilitate the green technological transformation. Since many, 
although not all, existing new technologies are owned by the advanced countries and the 
cost of inducing green technological change will be much higher for developing countries 
relative to their incomes, there will be important distributional challenges connected with 
greening the global economy, which will also need to be addressed through the above-
mentioned financing facilities and other new mechanisms of international cooperation.

This year’s World Economic and Social Survey examines the means by which 
the technological revolution can meet the requirements and sustain the objectives of green 
economy.

The complexity of technological change
The outcomes are uncertain

Technological change is a cumulative process, fraught with uncertainties as to direction 
and outcome. History also suggests that there is no simple technological sleight of hand 
for transforming production and consumption. Changes in the world’s dominant tech-
nologies  will  lead  to  significant  changes  in  social  structure,  market  institutions,  living 
arrangements and lifestyles.

Inevitably,  radical  technological  change  will  have  strong  distributive  effects 
across  and  within  countries.  Some  countries  and  groups  will  be  negatively  affected  by 
reduced demand for their products and resources. On the other hand, countries that keep 
up with research and development efforts and manage to generate new linkages with the 
rest of their economies will be better able to keep in step with the emerging technological 
trends and experience gains in wealth and welfare.

Overview

Technological change is closely linked to  
industrial upgrading and structural change

The biggest advances in technological capabilities and applications will have to occur in the 
developing world where technological upgrading involves structural changes in produc-
tion. The capacity of an economy to generate new dynamic activities is key to sustainable 
development. Because production processes must change in order to sustain long-term 
growth and facilitate development, Governments must choose enabling policies. This may 
involve what the Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter called “creative destruction”: cre-
ating new economic activities to replace older, less productive ones. Selective investment, 
industry  and  technology  policies  will  thus  become  essential  for  all  countries  pursuing 
sustainable development.

A Green National Innovation System (G-NIS) is needed

All countries have what has come to be called a national innovation system (NIS), which 
encompasses the educational system, scientific and technical research institutions, private 
firms’ product development departments and other mechanisms through which products 
and production processes are redesigned. All countries have a national innovation system, 
whether or not policymakers are conscious of its presence. A key responsibility of an ef-
fective NIS is building domestic capacity to choose, absorb and promote the technologies 
that are most conducive to enhancing dynamic sustainable development. This Survey pro-
poses mainstreaming sustainable development objectives into existing national innovation 
systems and situating those objectives at their very core so as to create what it calls Green 
National Innovation Systems (G-NIS). The G-NIS would also serve both to coordinate the 
reorientation of sector-specific innovation systems for agriculture, energy, construction, 
manufacturing and transport, among other sectors, towards a focus on green technologies 
and to ensure consistency among green technology, industrial and demand-side policies.

Accelerating the green energy transition
A radical energy transformation is needed

It is rapidly expanding energy use, mainly driven by fossil fuels, that explains why human-
ity is on the verge of breaching planetary sustainability boundaries through global warm-
ing, biodiversity loss, and disturbance of the nitrogen-cycle balance and other measures 
of the sustainability of the Earth’s ecosystem. A comprehensive global energy transition is 
urgently needed in order to avert a major planetary catastrophe.

While  climate  change  scenarios  indicate  that  the  transition  would  need  to 
be achieved within the next four decades, history and present developments suggest that 
this  would  be  virtually  impossible:  Previous  major  energy  transitions  took  from  70  to 
100 years (figure O.2). Since 1975, energy systems have stabilized around the use of fossil 
fuels  with  no  visible  shift  in  the  direction  of  a  new  transition  towards  renewable  and 
cleaner  primary  energy  sources,  despite  national  and  international  efforts  to  accelerate 
technological change in energy generation in response to the oil crises of the 1970s and

increasing concerns about global warming. Progress has been made in achieving greater 
energy efficiency (as determined by use of energy per unit of output) and increased use 
of certain types of technologies with lower carbon content, but these achievements have 
been greatly outweighed by rising energy demand leading to continued increases in global 
greenhouse gas emissions. The high levels of economic growth that developing countries 
will need to achieve in the coming decades in order to meet their development targets 
will lead to further drastic increases in energy demand. Far more drastic improvements 
in energy efficiency and an accelerated shift to sustainable energy will thus be required if 
catastrophic damage through climate change is to be averted.

Will such a transformation be feasible?

The long lifetimes of power plants, refineries, buildings and energy infrastructure make 
any energy transition necessarily a long-term affair. Global replacement costs of existing 
fossil  fuel  and  nuclear  power  infrastructure  are  estimated  at,  at  least,  $15  trillion–$20 
trillion (between one quarter and one third of global income). Some developing countries 
may be able to leapfrog directly to renewable energy sources, although the bulk of the 
energy infrastructure of most emerging and developing countries is already locked into 
the utilization of fossil fuels.

Many countries are already making efforts to foster a greener energy supply 
system, including through investments in energy innovation, feed-in tariffs and other price 
measures, and regulatory measures and efficiency standards designed to promote energy 
efficiency and diffusion of renewable and clean sources of energy. The Survey indicates, 
however, that the pace of progress of technological change is nowhere near that needed 
to reach the goal of full decarbonization of the global energy system by 2050. Clearly,

existing efforts are just not generating a global solution; and increased efforts to accelerate 
change will therefore be needed in both developed and developing countries.

The task will be daunting, partly because of the massive investments locked 
into brown energy technology and its interdependencies with the broader economic sys-
tem; and partly because, as present knowledge suggests, there may be technical limits to 
the massive scaling up of renewable energy technologies (such as wind and solar power), 
given present conversion efficiency as well as the limits to deployment of those technolo-
gies and improvements in their energy-use efficiency.

Accelerating a green energy transformation  
is possible—but it will be difficult

There are examples of rapid national energy transitions. Portugal, for example, increased 
the share of renewables (including hydroelectric power) in total energy supply from 17 to 
45 per cent in just five years, between 2005 and 2010. Such accelerated transitions will 
likely be easier in small and resource-rich or affluent economies than in large and resource-
poor or low-income countries. The 1987 Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete 
the Ozone Layer1 is an example of a global instrument that has produced successfully a 
framework for inducing a worldwide radical and swift shift away from polluting technolo-
gies, with special support to developing countries for adopting new technologies.

The Survey concludes that accelerating the green transition will require ensur-
ing coherence across a broad range of policies among all countries. These policies will, by 
and large, have to be adapted to local conditions and opportunities, and implemented at 
the national level. However, these national policies will need to “add up”, which is now 
not the case, so as to meet global targets, especially those for reducing greenhouse gas 
emissions, given the global nature of climate change.

Global targets need to recognize  
differences in levels of development

A global energy transformation should simultaneously meet emission targets and facilitate 
an upward convergence of energy usages of developing and developed countries (the per 
capita income and energy availabilities of the former are on average one tenth those of the 
latter). The Kyoto Protocol2 to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
Change3 requires signatories to reduce their yearly emissions to about 13 tons of CO2
emissions per person by 2012, which seems achievable. This target would be coupled with 
declining rates of emissions increase in developing countries. To stay within the absolute 
CO2 concentration limit of 450 parts per million accepted by the Copenhagen Climate 
Change Summit, accelerated progress towards a renewable or green energy transformation 
will be needed, as this limit would entail cutting annual emissions gradually to 3 tons per 
person by 2050, or less for any more stringent limit set to stabilize the climate.

However, given that current knowledge suggests that there may be limits to the 
degree to which renewable technologies can be scaled up and the extent to which energy 
efficiency can be increased to meet growing energy demand, caps on energy consumption

(with significant implications for production and consumption processes) to complement 
emission reduction targets may need to be considered. The Survey estimates that the emis-
sions cap would be equivalent to primary energy consumption of 70 gigajoules per capita 
per year, which means that the average European would have to cut his or her present 
energy consumption by about half and the average resident of the United States of America 
by about three quarters. Most developing-country citizens would still be able to signifi-
cantly increase their average energy usage for some period of time. Even so, developing 
countries will not be able to avoid making the green energy transformation as well to 
ensure that global emission reduction targets can be met.

Green energy policies need to be coherent  
along production and consumption chains
In accelerating technological transformation to meet emissions and energy-use 

targets, the Survey recommends that policies and actions be guided by four key goals.

Improving energy efficiency in end use without expanding  
consumption where energy-use levels are already high

Reducing  energy  use  through  technological  change—entailing  production  of  factory 
equipment, home appliances and automobiles that are more energy-efficient—is poten-
tially as important as installing clean energy supply facilities. This will, however, require 
a quantum increase in support for research and deployment in a relatively neglected area. 
In order for macrolevel gains to be reaped from end-use efficiencies, it is important that 
improved energy efficiency not be allowed to become the basis for an increase in activity 
and consumption in developed countries and that such increases be permitted only in 
countries that are still overcoming energy and income deficits.

Supporting a broad energy technology development portfolio globally 
while adapting more mature technologies in specific locations

A wide range of technologies exist for producing clean energy and reducing energy inten-
sity of production and consumption. Most experts concur that Governments, in particular 
advanced economies, should promote the development of a broad portfolio of technolo-
gies  (including  renewables  such  as  solar,  wind,  geothermal  and  hydropower)  along  the 
full chain of technology development (research, development and demonstration, market 
formation, diffusion and commercial adaptation). Most developing countries may opt for 
a more focused portfolio, given that their entry into energy technological transformation 
would take place at mature stages of the process.

Supporting more extensive experimentation and discovery periods

Support for technological development must also allow for experimentation sufficient to 
ensure that the more efficient technologies are scaled up, with the end goal being, in all 
cases,  commercial  viability.  Government  support  programmes  should  ensure  that  con-
sistent improvement of technologies is focused towards widespread usability beyond the 
demonstration stage and should avoid a premature locking in of suboptimal technologies 
that are not viable in non-specialized situations.

Using “smart” governance and accountability strategies 
in energy-related technological development

It is important, at the global and national levels, to expand oversight by independent and 
broadly representative technical bodies of the allocation of public funds for technological 
development. Support programmes should have sufficient flexibility to provide and with-
draw resources based on potential and opportunity cost considerations. Governments can 
subsidize and reward efforts by private companies to achieve progressively higher energy 
efficiencies in end-use products such as factory equipment, cars and home appliances. An 
excellent example of such an approach is Japan’s Top Runner programme, which turns the 
most efficient product into a standard to be met by other manufacturers within a given 
time period. Upgrading towards technologies that are low on emissions and highly energy-
efficient should be a key objective of industrial policy.

Technological change for sustainable food security
The first green revolution in agriculture 
was in fact not all that “green”

The recent food crises laid bare deeper structural problems within the global food system 
and the need to increase investment and foster innovation in agriculture so as to accelerate 
growth of food production in order to overcome hunger and feed a growing world popula-
tion. Achieving this goal with existing agricultural technologies and production systems 
would entail further increases in greenhouse gas emissions, water pollution, deforestation 
and land degradation, which in turn would impose further environmental limits on food 
production growth itself.

In large parts of the world, food systems were shaped to a considerable extent 
by the so-called green revolution of the 1960s and 1970s, which pushed agricultural yields 
as much through intensive use of irrigation water and environmentally harmful chemical 
fertilizers and pesticides, as the introduction of new seed varieties (figure O.3).

A truly green agricultural revolution is now needed …

Food security must now be attained through green technology so as to reduce the use of 
chemical inputs (fertilizers and pesticides) and to make more efficient use of energy, water 
and  natural  resources,  as  well  as  through  significant  improvement  of  storage  facilities, 
and marketing to reduce waste. An extensive menu of already available green technologies 
and sustainable practices in agriculture (which have been successfully adopted with large 
productivity gains in developing-country contexts) can be deployed to lead the radical 
transformation  towards  sustainable  food  security,  including  technologies  and  practices 
such  as  low-tillage  farming,  crop  rotation  and  interplanting,  water  harvesting  and  re-
cycling, water-efficient cropping, agroforestry and integrated pest management. Further, 
biotechnology,  genetic  engineering,  food  irradiation,  hydroponics  and  anaerobic  diges-
tion hold out the promise of improving the resistance of food crops to pests and extreme 
weather, increasing their nutritional value and reducing food contamination and green-
house gas emissions. Development of new high-yielding varieties of crops, a central focus 
of the first green revolution in agriculture, should continue, provided such development is

combined with improved water management and better use of agrochemical and organic 
inputs so as to substantially reduce their adverse ecological impacts, as in the System of 
Rice Intensification (SRI) which raises crop yield while reducing water, chemical fertilizer 
and pesticide usage through simple changes in the times when and the means by which 
rice seeds are transplanted and irrigated.

… a revolution with a key focus on small-scale farming

While these technologies need to be improved further, the main challenge is to change 
incentive  structures  so  as  to  encourage  their  widespread  use.  The  Survey  reaffirms  the 
view taken by the international community at the 1996 World Food Summit and when 
defining responses to the food crisis of 2007-2008, namely, that the main policy focus on 
the supply side should be promotion and development of sustainable agriculture, with an 
emphasis on small farm holders in developing countries, since it is in this area that most 
gains in terms of both productivity increases and rural poverty reduction can be achieved. 
In developing countries, most food is still locally produced and consumed, placing small-
scale farming at the heart of food production systems.

The green revolution of the 1960s and 1970s bypassed many small farm hold-
ers because of its focus on a single technological package—one that did not address the 
context-specific conditions of millions of farmers, mainly in Africa. Without providing 
adequate technologies and a larger range of supportive services (rural infrastructure, like 
rural roads and sustainable irrigation systems, education and training and access to land, 
credits, affordable inputs and market information), small farm holders are, typically, not 
able to take advantage of available technological improvements.

Overview

A comprehensive approach to food security is essential …

The policy challenge is thus twofold. First, effective ways must be found to adapt sustain-
able  agricultural  technologies  to  local  conditions  and  the  needs  of  small  farm  holders. 
Second, dynamic innovative processes must be introduced at the local level, including by 
putting in place the necessary support infrastructure and services, as well as strengthened 
forms of association and joint production among farmers (such as cooperatives and land 
consolidation),  especially  for  crops  whose  cultivation  benefits  from  economies  of  scale.  
Taking advantage of scale economies could also be appropriate in serving large markets 
and accessing inputs and credit. Increased agricultural productivity raises rural incomes 
and frees labour for the industrial sector.

The Survey argues that a comprehensive policy approach is needed to take on 
these challenges, which would involve both a comprehensive national framework for sus-
tainable use of resources, and new technology and innovation with the capacity to increase 
the productivity, profitability, stability, resilience and climate change mitigation potential 
of rural production systems. Water conservation, soil protection and biodiversity enhance-
ment need to form part of an integrated approach aimed at sustainable management of 
land and other natural resources and also need to build on synergies between the forest 
and agriculture sectors. In the context of competitive land uses, many solutions, involving 
difficult choices, will be reachable only through open and inclusive negotiation and dis-
cussion. Nevertheless, the aforementioned synergies between sectors (resulting, inter alia, 
in reduced deforestation and increased land productivity, and sustainable water supply) 
present important “win-win” options through better resource management facilitated by 
an enabling institutional environment.

… and will need to be supported by an enabling 
institutional environment

Countries should consider placing a Sustainable Agricultural Innovation System (SAIS) at 
the centre of a comprehensive policy approach to achieving food security and environmen-
tal sustainability. The SAIS, as the agricultural and natural resource management pillar of 
a Green National Innovation System, would link the multiplicity of actors that participate 
in  national  innovation  systems  in  agriculture:  universities,  research  institutions,  firms, 
farmers, civil society organizations and private foundations.

Sustainable transformation of agriculture requires greater national capacities 
to adapt to continuous environmental and market change. A dynamic SAIS would provide 
the framework for the policy coherence needed to accelerate the desired transformation 
of agriculture, including by laying out the strategies for easing the adaptation of green 
technologies  and  sustainable  crop  practices,  and  for  improving  the  capacity  of  farmers 
to innovate through learning and experimentation and to secure better access to input 
and product markets through partnerships with other actors (research institutions, private 
corporations, non-governmental organizations and local governments).

Research capacities will need to be rebuilt

The creation of a Sustainable Agricultural Innovation System able to assume a leadership 
role in the new green revolution will require a new effort to rebuild global and national 
research capacities in agriculture and natural resource management, including through 
increased financial support for agricultural research and development. Experience from 

xviii

World Economic and Social Survey 2011

the previous green revolution has shown that the adoption of new technology for food 
security requires long-term financial support for research and development. A significant 
component  of  that  support  had  been  channelled  through  the  Consultative  Group  on 
International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) network, which lost much of its capacity to 
exercise leadership in further technological innovation when the flow of resources became 
unstable and decreased. The international and national public sectors have an important 
role to play in facilitating farmers’ free access to information and technology by providing 
adequate incentives to the private and not-for-profit sectors to collaborate in producing 
public goods, and by reinvigorating and helping to reorient the focus of networks like 
CGIAR as part of an SAIS and international cooperation.

The previous green revolution took less than a decade to increase food produc-
tion at impressive rates. The new revolution in agriculture needed to improve food security 
and halt the depletion of natural resources can, with adequate financial resources and politi-
cal support, be produced through the incorporation of available technology in farming.

International support will be critical

The international community has much to contribute to the transformation in agriculture by 
removing obstacles to the transfer of technology (including privately held patents); deliver-
ing on its commitment to mobilize $20 billion in additional official development assistance 
(ODA) for sustainable agriculture, as pledged at the 2009 G8 Summit held in L’Aquila, 
Italy; providing small-scale farmers with expanded access to mechanisms for the payment 
of environmental services; and, in the case of Organization for Economic Cooperation and 
Development (OECD) member countries, eliminating agricultural subsidies.

Harm inflicted by natural events
The frequency of climate-related disasters is increasing

The frequency of natural disasters has quintupled over the past 40 years. By far, most of 
this increase can be accounted for by the greater incidence of hydro-meteorological disas-
ters (floods, storms, droughts and extreme temperatures) associated with climate change. 
Major disruptions in the ecosystem, often referred to as “extreme events”, have become 
more likely. Such events could already be occurring in the area of biodiversity (resulting 
in rapid extinction of species) and may be close to occurring in the fisheries domain and 
in some water systems.

Developing countries tend to suffer more from the adverse consequences of 
natural hazards through multiple vulnerabilities associated with lower levels of develop-
ment and inadequate resources, which constrain their efforts to build more adequate and 
resilient infrastructure and implement adequate disaster risk management strategies.

Disaster risk management should be an integral  
part of national development strategies

Despite the urgent threat involved, disaster risk management and adaptation to climate 
change  in  developed  and  developing  countries  alike  have  not  been  mainstreamed  into 
broader decision-making processes. In practice, responses are most often largely event-
driven.  The  Survey  emphasizes,  in  contrast,  that  investment  and  technology  decisions 

Overview

related to disaster risk reduction and adaptation to climate change should be embedded 
in national development strategies. This approach is in line with that set out in the Hyogo 
Framework for Action 2005-2015: Building the Resilience of Nations and Communities 
to Disasters4 for disaster risk management and in the Cancun Adaptation Framework.5

Existing technologies can be deployed

Reducing disaster risk in a sustainable manner will involve changes in the design of settle-
ments and infrastructure, including roads, rail systems and power plants. Existing modern 
technologies,  including  sea  walls,  tidal  and  saltwater  intrusion  barriers,  and  improved 
water and crop storage, appear by and large to be adequate to the task of providing protec-
tion against most (non-extreme) hazards. Further technological innovation, which draws 
on indigenous knowledge, is needed to adapt disaster-resilient infrastructure, housing and 
natural coastal protection to local conditions and to make the technologies more afford-
able for developing countries.

National efforts need to be supported through  
regional and global cooperation

Natural hazards know no national borders and often affect larger regions. National-level 
disaster risk management will thus need to be linked to regional mechanisms of coopera-
tion, including for maintaining joint monitoring, forecasting, and early warning systems, 
and defining risk reduction strategies.

International  cooperation  will  also  require  facilitating  technology  transfer 
to  developing  countries  in  order  to  reduce  the  local  harm  caused  by  global  warming. 
Technology  transfer  should  ensure  that  recipients  have  the  capacity  to  install,  operate, 
maintain and repair imported technologies. It will be important for local adapters to be 
able to produce lower-cost versions of imported technologies and adapt imported tech-
nologies  to  domestic  markets  and  circumstances.  In  the  Hyogo  Framework  for  Action 
and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the international 
community  identified  the  need  for  external  financial  support  for  local  adaptation  and 
disaster resilience efforts, including through the mobilization of resources for dedicated 
multilateral funding.

Technology transfer and international cooperation
Multilateral trading rules and international  
finance need to be “greened”

A sustained scaling up and reform in international cooperation and finance are required to 
achieve the global technological revolution. Scaling up and reforms require action in three 
areas. First, an international regime for green technology-sharing will have to be established 
to  facilitate  technology  transfers  to  and  development  in  developing  countries.  This  will 
include using a broader set of tools in intellectual property and multilateral trade policies.

Second, securing adequate development finance and policy space to energize developing-
country efforts to upgrade production technologies towards environmental sustainability is 
indispensable. Third, international governance and cooperation have to be upgraded.

An effective global technology development  
and diffusion regime needs to be established

Expanding action in nurturing and upgrading green production and consumption technolo-
gies in developing countries must be a key goal of international cooperation. However, pub-
licly guided international mechanisms of technological diffusion have limited precedents, 
since, historically, the bulk of technological knowledge has been embodied and transferred 
as private property through the operations of private companies. The successful experience 
of CGIAR is an example of how rapid worldwide diffusion of new agricultural technologies 
can be effected through a publicly supported global and regional network of research insti-
tutions. In the climate change area, building international public policymaking capability 
can draw upon the experiences already existing in international scientific networks and the 
example of multi-stakeholder cooperation provided by the work of the Intergovernmental 
Panel on Climate Change. The international community took the first step towards meet-
ing this challenge in reaching an agreement at the Conference of the Parties to the United 
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change at its sixteenth session, held in Cancun, 
Mexico,  from  29  November  to  10  December  2010,  to  set  up  a  Technology  Executive 
Committee (TEC) as a policymaking body 6 to implement the framework for meaningful 
and effective actions to enhance the implementation commitments on technology transfer.7
At the same session, agreement was reached on establishing an operational body to facilitate 
a networking among national, regional, sectoral and international technology bodies, to be 
called the Climate Technology Centre and Network (CTCN).8

The intellectual property rights regime needs to be changed
Managing global intellectual property rights is also crucial, as patenting is highly aggres-
sive in various areas of green technology. For example, a small group of private companies 
is  actively  patenting  plant  genes  with  a  view  to  owning  the  rights  to  the  genes’  pos-
sible “climate readiness” in the future. Granting intellectual property rights constitutes, 
and should always remain, a public policy action, one whose intention is to consistently 
stimulate—not restrict—private initiative in technological development. At the present 
time, the granting of a patent is the most widespread and lucrative technological develop-
ment incentive.

Obtaining agreement among countries on the public policies needed to ac-
celerate invention and diffusion is critical. Currently, protecting private intellectual prop-
erty rights by enforcing exclusive use and deployment by its owner is the main approach. 
Internationally,  spurring  green  technological  development  will  require  a  wider  mix  of 
public sector strategies, which guarantee a commercial incentive substantial enough to en-
able private parties to use subsidies and public purchases of technology at reasonable cost

in their research undertakings, while constraining monopolistic practices which restrict 
diffusion and further development.

Public policy tools could include global funding for research, to be placed in 
the public domain for widespread dissemination under the same modality utilized in the 
green revolution in food agriculture in the 1960s and 1970s. With technology funds, it 
should be possible to establish international innovation networks within different areas of 
technology. The overall strategy could also include global awards for the formulation of 
technical solutions to well-defined problems, and public purchase at appropriate prices of 
private technology for deployment in the public domain. The private sector must continue 
to play a vital role in technological development, particularly in developing and adapting 
basic inventions for actual application.

The new international regime should allow special and differential access to new 
technology based on level of development. For example, developing-country Governments 
and firms could be allowed to adapt technology but begin paying royalties only when its 
use has begun to yield commercial returns. Where exclusive private-sector rights of use 
to vital technology are a hindrance to the development of other needed technology or to 
widespread use, the technology regime must have a mechanism (such as exists in certain 
areas of public health) for granting a “compulsory licence” that places said technology in 
the public domain.

Multilateral trading rules should grant greater flexibility to 
developing countries in their conduct of industrial policies

Present project-oriented loan conditionality and the proliferation of international financ-
ing mechanisms thwart developing countries’ efforts to design and implement coherent 
strategies for sustainable development. Investment measure-related restrictions (from the 
multilateral trade regime and bilateral treaties) shackle attempts to implement industrial 
policy at a time when developed-country industrial interventions for building green tech-
nologies are proliferating. Thus, it is important to guarantee developing countries sufficient 
policy space for industrial development.

The multilateral trading system should allow developing countries higher levels of 
bound tariffs and a greater range in those levels than were proposed under the Doha process. 
It is also important to consider recognizing industrial policies encompassing, for example, 
domestic content and technology transfer requirements so as to enable developing countries 
to undertake sector-specific programmes aimed at building dynamic local industries.

Environmental  standards  have  served  as  effective  industrial  policy  instru-
ments for accelerating technological transformations. At present, technical standards are 
often determined by Governments (unilaterally or through agreements among a reduced 
number of countries) or set by private companies. Wider participation of all parties in 
the setting of these standards, especially developing countries, should guarantee that the 
introduction of environmental standards (including through green labels and ecological 
footprint certificates) will not become a means of practising unfair trade protectionism. 
The Montreal Protocol process through which the substances to be banned and the pace 
of their elimination were identified may serve as an example in this regard.

Financing of green technology transfers will require 
domestic and international financial reforms

To facilitate the introduction of the new green technologies, investment rates in developing 
countries will have to be stepped up considerably. Inadequate financing has been consist-
ently identified by developing countries as the greatest obstacle to their rapid adoption of 
clean technologies (figure O.4).

Using scenarios that are consistent across sectors, the Survey estimates that incre-
mental green investment of about 3 per cent of world gross product (WGP) (about $1.9 trillion 
in 2010) would be required to overcome poverty, increase food production to eradicate hunger 
without degrading land and water resources, and avert the climate change catastrophe. Given 
the limited time frame for achieving the required technological transformation, the required 
global level of green investments would need to be reached within the next few years.

At least one half of the required investments would have to be realized in de-
veloping countries. Enhanced domestic resource mobilization (private savings and public 
revenues) should be key to financing the additional investment effort over the medium 
run. Many developing countries have poorly developed markets for long-term financing 
and a weak fiscal basis, which limit the scope for substantial increases in domestic fund-
ing for long-term investment in the near term. Other constraints on investing domestic 
resources in developing countries originate from deficiencies in the global financial and 
payments system. A number of developing countries hold a significant portion of domestic 
savings as international reserves, which in large measure have been invested in financial 
assets  in  developed  countries.  The  volatility  of  global  capital  and  commodity  markets 
are an important determinant underlying this form of self-insurance and substantial net

transfer of financial resources to advanced market economies. Reforms of the international 
payments and reserve system that would stem global market volatility and reduce the need 
for reserve accumulation by individual developing countries could liberate substantial re-
sources (including from sovereign wealth funds through the use of special drawing rights) 
for long-term financing in green investments. Moreover, this would facilitate effective net 
resource transfers to developing countries.

The external financing currently available for green technology investments in 
developing countries is far from sufficient to meet the challenge. The Global Environment 
Facility and climate change trust funds under the management of the World Bank man-
aged to disburse no more than $20 billion per year in the last two years. Consequently, 
at present most of the financing for technology transfer is dependent on foreign direct 
investment (FDI) flows, technical cooperation provisions in external assistance grants and 
loans and export credit agency funding. However, all of these mechanisms lack incentives 
and policy contexts conducive to investment in green technologies.

The commitment set out in the Copenhagen Accord to mobilize $30 billion 
for the period 2010-2012 and $100 billion per year by 2020 in transfers to developing 
countries  is  more  of  a  step  in  the  right  direction,  but  that  commitment  has  yet  to  be 
realized. The Survey estimates that developing countries will require a little over $1 tril-
lion a year in incremental green investment. While a large proportion of the incremental 
investment would ultimately be financed from developing countries’ public and private 
resources, international financing will be indispensable,  particularly in the early years, in 
jump-starting green investment and financing the adoption of external technologies. The 
Copenhagen pledges do not appear to match the required scaling up of the global effort.   
The scaling up likely also comes too late, given the limited time available.

Global governance capabilities need to be strengthened

The proposed reshaping of national development efforts and strengthened international 
commitment in the areas of technological development and cooperation, external assist-
ance, investment finance and trade rules will require stronger mechanisms of global gov-
ernance and coordination. Within the next three to four decades, all of these efforts must 
“add up” to achieving what today seems to be a set of almost unattainable targets, includ-
ing a reduction in per capita carbon emissions by almost three fourths and the eradication 
of poverty, which will require an almost 10 times greater availability of modern energy 
sources by those now counted as poor.

The Survey recognizes that the bulk of the efforts to carry out a technologi-
cal transformation must occur at the country level and build upon local conditions and 
resources. The need for an effective global technology policymaking body has already been 
indicated. If the overall global objectives are to be achieved, two critical conditions need 
to be fulfilled. First, more effective monitoring and verification of performance on inter-
national commitments are needed. As regards establishing the corresponding mechanisms 
of common accountability, lessons can be drawn from existing modalities in other areas, 
such as the trade policy review process of the World Trade Organization.

Second, much greater coherence will be required among the now noticeably 
disjointed multilateral architectures for environment, technology transfer, trade, aid and 
finance so as to facilitate coordination among what will likely be a diverse set of country 
strategies for green growth and ensure that they add up to global targets for environmental 
sustainability.

World Economic and Social Survey 2011

At the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, held in 
Rio de Janeiro from 3 to 14 June 1992, the community of nations reached agreement on a 
“precautionary principle” to serve as a guide to public policy. According to that principle, 
in the absence of scientific consensus that a particular action or policy is harmful to the 
public or to the environment, the burden of proof that the suspect action or policy is not 
harmful rests with the party or parties implementing it. The precautionary principle deter-
mines that there exists a social responsibility to protect the public from exposure to harm 
in cases where scientific investigation has found a plausible risk of harm, which implies 
that all possible means should be applied towards achieving sustainable development.

technological transformation is 
needed

Summary
The cumulative effects of the degradation of the Earth’s natural environment has increased the 
scale of the sustainable development challenge enormously.  Provisioning for human life using the 
current technology is expected to be increasingly infeasible as population continues to increase 
and the harmful impacts of human production and consumption multiply. 
Business  as  usual  is  not  an  option.  An  attempt  to  overcome  world  poverty  through  income 
growth generated by existing “brown technologies” would exceed the limits of environmental 
sustainability. 
A global green technological transformation, greater in scale and achievable within a much shorter 
time-frame than the first industrial revolution, is required. The necessary set of new technologies 
must enable today’s poor to attain decent living standards, while reducing emissions and waste 
and ending the unrestrained drawdown of the earth’s non-renewable resources.  
Staging a new technological revolution at a faster pace and on a global scale will call for proactive 
government intervention and greater international cooperation. Sweeping technological change 
will  require  sweeping  societal  transformation,  with  changed  settlement  and  consumption 
patterns and better social values.

The development challenge and the  
emerging environmental crisis

Since the first industrial revolution, major transformations in energy technology (from 
muscle power to water, then steam, and later hydrocarbons) and other innovations have 
generated substantial increases in production and human activity. However, the same tech-
nologies that enabled the quantum increases in material welfare have also come at a lasting 
cost with respect to the degradation of the world’s natural environment. To continue to 
tread  the  pathways  of  past  economic  development  would  further  enhance  pressure  on 
natural resources and would destabilize the Earth’s ecosystem. Even if we were to now stop 
global growth engines, the depletion and degradation of the world’s natural environment 
would continue because of existing consumption habits and production methods. Much 
greater economic progress is needed in order to lift the poor out of poverty and provide for 
a decent living for all, including the additional 2 billion people who will inhabit the planet 
by mid-century. Hence, there is an urgent need to seek out new development pathways 
that will ensure environmental sustainability and reverse ecological destruction, and at the 
same time serve as the source of decent livelihoods for all of today’s population and for 
future generations.

The current pattern of 
economic growth has led to 
the environmental crisis

Unremitting increases in population and income

The increases in population 
and production have 
exhibited a “hockey  
stick” pattern

Both  population  and  incomes  have  grown  exponentially  over  the  past  two  centuries. 
While world population size had remained relatively stable for much of human history, it 
started to increase at an accelerated pace with the first industrial revolution (figure I.1).1
The world population increased from about 1 billion in 1800 to about 6.5 billion by 2010 
and is likely to increase, according to United Nations projections, to about 9 billion by the 
end of this century.

Similarly, human per capita welfare is believed to have increased at a very slow 
pace for most of human history, having taken off only with the industrial revolution.2
Since 1820, income growth, like population size, has exhibited a “hockey stick pattern” 
(see figure I.2), with per capita income increasing 24 times faster than during the period 
1000-1820.3

It is estimated that even in 10,000 BC, at the onset of the Neolithic revolution, the world population 
was only about 1 million. Population increased with the successes of Neolithic agriculture and the 
Bronze- and Iron-Age civilizations. However, even at the onset of the first industrial revolution 
(1750 AD), world population was limited to only 750 million. Since 1820, population has increased 
at the rate of 1 per cent per year, a rate that is 6 times higher than that prevailing during the period 
1000-1820 (Maddison, 2007, p. 69). 
According to Maddison (2007), average world income increased by only about 50 per cent between 
1000 and 1820 AD. His research suggests that annual per capita income of most ancient societies 
was about 400 international PPP dollars (IPPP$). DeLong (1998) places this figure much lower, at 
IPPP$ 90. In any case, until 1820, economic growth, by and large, was extensive, serving mainly to 
accommodate the fourfold increase in population.
Since 1820, per capita income has increased by 1.2 per cent per year (Maddison, 2007).

Lopsided distribution of population and income growth

Most of the observed per capita income growth has been concentrated in the currently de-
veloped part of the world (figure I.3). Much smaller gains have been observed in much of 
Asia, Africa and Latin America. Income growth in developed countries was accompanied 
by drastic declines in birth and mortality rates and increases in longevity, accelerating a 
demographic  transition.  By  contrast,  developing  countries  still  face  much  higher  birth 
rates relative to mortality rates, coupled with the slower income growth and, as a result, 
see much faster population growth (figure I.4).4 This lopsided distribution of income and 
population has aggravated the environmental crisis in many ways.

Environmental impact of increased population and income

The Earth has a double function in ensuring human survival—serving as both “source” of 
the natural resources necessary for, and “sink” for the waste (including pollution) gener-
ated by, production and consumption. The impact on that double function of dramatic 
increases in population and average income, in combination with other conducing factors, 
has sown the seeds of an environmental crisis.

The hockey-stick patterns of population and income growth are mirrored by 
the exponential increase in energy consumption (figure I.5).5 Increased energy consump-
tion has led to a commensurate increase in emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) into the 
Between  1750  and  2008,  the  combined  populations  of  Europe,  North  America  and  Oceania 
increased almost sevenfold, from 167 million to 1,103 million, while the combined populations of 
Asia, Africa and Latin America (including the Caribbean) increased ninefold, from 624 million to 
5.6 billion.
Primary energy consumption had increased from a little over 10 exajoules (EJ) in 1850 to about 
500 EJ by 2000.

atmosphere, from a pre-industrial level of about 260 parts per million (ppm) to close to 
400 ppm in 2010 (figure I.6).6 Rising concentrations of CO2 and other greenhouse gases 
have caused a similarly steep increase in average global temperatures, which are now about 
1°  C  above  those  observed  around  1850  and  in  the  centuries  before  (figure  I.7).  With 
trends  in  greenhouse  gas  emissions  continuing,  global  temperatures  are  set  to  increase 
further, and will likely average between 2° C and 5° C above pre-industrial levels by the 
end of the century (figure I.8), surpassing the limits for a stable climate and becoming 
high enough to cause cataclysmic changes (United Nations, 2009). The extreme weather 
events whose incidence has increased in recent years prove how devastating these changes 
can be (see chap. IV).

There  also  has  been  a  secular  rise  in  the  volume  of  waste  accompanied  by 
alarming changes in its composition. Waste is becoming increasingly non-biodegradable, 
toxic  and  radioactive.  For  example,  non-biodegradable  plastic  now  far  outweighs  such 
natural materials as timber, paper, iron, copper, lead, aluminium, phosphorus and potash 
in GDP (figure I.9).

This brief survey demonstrates that, since the first industrial revolution, there 
has been a switch from an almost horizontal to an almost vertical pattern of rise in popula-
tion,  income,  resource  use  and  waste  dumped  into  the  Earth’s  ecosystem.  This  switch 
has caused irreparable damage to the Earth’s ecosystems and is knocking it off balance. 
According to the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (2005):

•	

Sixty  per  cent  of  a  group  of  24  ecosystems  are  now  degraded  or  exploited 
beyond ecological limits

6

From  a  pre-industrial  level  of  less  than  5  gigatons  (Gt),  which  is  roughly  the  atmosphere’s 
absorptive capacity, the amount of CO2 emitted has increased to about 40 Gt.

The world has lost 50 per cent of its wetlands since 1900
More land was converted to cropland in the 30 years after 1950 than in the 
period 1700-1850
Forest area has shrunk by about 40 per cent over the past 300 years
Twenty-five countries have completely lost their forests and 29 countries have 
less than 10 per cent forest cover
The current species extinction rate is about 1,000 times higher than the rates 
that prevailed over the planet’s history
The world has lost 50 per cent of its mangrove forests since 1980
Agriculture accounts for 70 per cent of worldwide water use
Dams contain four times more water today than in 1960
There is now from three to six times more water in reservoirs than in natural 
rivers
The  ecological  degradation  and  destruction,  as  detailed  above,  are  having 
alarming effects on the Earth’s function as a source of natural resources, including through 
the adverse impacts on the quality of land, land-use patterns and food production, which 
are aggravating food insecurity (as discussed in chap. III). The risk of non-linear changes 
which could provoke sudden catastrophes and destabilize ecosystems has increased sub-
stantially. The collapse of fisheries, the pandemic spread of diseases and the extinction 
of species are imminent threats. Ecological degradation and destruction are aggravating 
human vulnerability, particularly for those people who are forced to settle in areas suscep-
tible to risk. For example, the degradation of mangrove forests was one of the reasons for 
the high toll exacted by the Indian Ocean tsunami of December 2004 (see chap. IV for 
a discussion of rising trends in the frequency and intensity of natural disasters and their 
impact).

Clearly, the current hockey-stick pattern of development with its concomitant 
steep rises in resource use and waste is not sustainable. The question is what can be done to 
ensure that development does not exceed the limits of the Earth’s carrying capacity while 
assuring that all of its inhabitants have fulfilling lives, based, inter alia, on the convergence 
of the living standards of currently developed and developing parts of the world.

Sustainable development and  
the green economy paradigms

The concept of sustainable development

Sustainable development 
entails combining 
economic and social 
development and 
environmental protection

The argument that the current pattern of development is not sustainable had already been 
made several decades ago, but has yet to lead to a change of direction. To amalgamate 
existing forces and direct them towards implementation of new policy approaches, the 
World Commission on Environment and Development (the Brundtland Commission), in 
its 1987 report entitled Our Common Future (World Commission on Environment and 
Development, 1987), proposed the now widely agreed definition of the concept of sustain-
able development as the process that “meets the needs of the present without compromising 
the ability of future generations to meet their own needs” (p. 8). However, this definition, 
while  being  widely  accepted,  gave  rise  (owing  to  its  somewhat  general  focus)  to  many

States on the concrete steps

different  interpretations  and  explications.7  Nevertheless,  within  the  framework  of  the 
international agreement reached at the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment 
and Development, as reflected in its adoption of the Rio Declaration on Environment and 
Development (United Nations, 1993) and Agenda 21 (ibid.), the concept of sustainable 
development is perceived as encompassing the pursuit of three goals: economic develop-
ment, social development and environmental protection.

The Brundtland Commission report paid particular attention to the interrela-
tionships among these three goals, noting two-way connections between any given pair.8
In particular, noting that social development was necessary for sustaining both economic 
development and environmental protection, the Commission observed that “(a) world in 
which  poverty  is  endemic  will  always  be  prone  to  ecological  and  other  catastrophes”9
and that “the distribution of power and influence within society lies at the heart of most 
environment and development challenges”.10 It also emphasized that sustainable develop-
ment is not a goal applicable only to developing countries but must be a goal of developed 
countries as well.

The work of the World Commission on Environment and Development led to 
the decision of the Governing Council of the United Nations Environment Programme 
(UNEP), at is fifteenth session, to recommend to the General Assembly that it convene a 
United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (United Nations, General 
Assembly, 1989). The Conference, popularly known as the Rio Earth Summit, was held in 
June 1992. The aforementioned Rio Declaration on Environment and Development pro-
claimed, inter alia, the right to development (principle 3) and that, in view of the different 
contributions to global environmental degradation, States had common but differentiated 
responsibilities (principle 7). Agenda 21 laid out before the international community a 
very broad set of objectives to be achieved in the twenty-first century. Finding ways to 
compel action on the commitments contained in Agenda 21 required agreement among 
Member States on concrete steps towards development cooperation, or at least on concrete 
indicators. The formulation of the Millennium Development Goals in 2000 can be seen as 
a further step forward towards agreement on concrete indicators of achievement of social 
development targets.10

At the start of the twenty-first century, then, the world community had both a 
broad-ranging agenda for sustainable development encompassing economic development, 
social development and environmental protection; and a set of indicators for the achieve-
ment of specific social development goals whose pursuit has already spurred notable action 
and policy initiatives.

For instance, for some, the concept of sustainable development implies that the current generation 
must leave for the next generation the same amount of “natural capital” as it had inherited from 
the previous generation. In other words, conservation of the stock of natural capital constituted 
a condition for development to be considered sustainable. See Pearce, Markandya and Barbier 
(1989) for a compilation and discussion of various definitions of sustainable development. 
The distinction between “economic development” and “social development” as used here follows 
common  usage  in  the  mainstream  literature,  according  to  which  reduction  of  poverty  and 
inequality, increase in access by and empowerment of the poor and disadvantaged groups of the 
society, among other objectives, are to be considered a social (rather than an economic) goal. In 
contrast, other theoretical perspectives would regard poverty reduction, decrease in inequality 
of income and assets and improvement in access to productive resources as equally important 
economic goals and conditions for enhancing economic efficiency and growth.

The concept of a “green economy”

The concept of a green 
economy constitutes a 
response to the further 
aggravation of the 
environmental crisis

Insisting on the green 
economy concept can be 
risky for a variety of reasons

Green economy-related 
efforts should fit within the 
sustainable development 
framework

While the ‘green economy’ had been before,11 its current application is sometimes associ-
ated with the 2008 crisis and the environmental sustainability context of the stimulus 
packages  that  were  considered  in  an  effort  to  overcome  it.  Influenced,  in  part,  by  the 
climate change-related negotiations on the eve of the fifteenth session of the Conference 
of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change,12 held 
in Copenhagen from 7 to 19 December 2009, many argued for making these stimulus 
packages “green”. Some countries actually did make a conscious effort to include in their 
stimulus packages projects that would be directed towards protection of the environment 
and mitigation of climate change. Over time, other expressions besides green economy—
such as green growth, green stimulus, green technologies, green sectors, green business and 
green jobs—have entered common parlance.

However,  despite  its  increasing  utilization,  the  concept  of  a  green  economy 
is not well defined. Noting the many different ways in which the concept is used, the 
Secretary-General, in a report to the General Assembly, concluded that “‘green economy’ 
is an omnibus term” (United Nations, General Assembly, 2010a, para. 57) and therefore 
asked for “greater conceptual clarity with regard to the links between a green economy and 
sustainable development” (ibid., para. 57(a)).

In general, the concept of a green economy is invoked in an attempt to stress 
environmental  sustainability  and  protection  while  pursuing  sustainable  development. 
Possibly because of the lack of a clear definition, the current interest in greening econo-
mies has revived concerns and debates harking back to the days when the Brundtland 
Commission was struggling to effect a consensus on the concept of sustainable develop-
ment. In the current debate, many developing-country representatives have expressed the 
view that the insistence on a green economy is risky for a variety of reasons (Khor, 2011a). 
They are concerned: (a) that it could lead to a one-dimensional focus on environment and 
a corresponding marginalization of social development goals, and that if adopted at the 
global level, a focus on the green economy might thereby undercut the importance and 
urgency of developing countries’ right to development; (b) that such a focus could lead to 
a “one size fits all” approach through which developed and developing countries would be 
judged by the same yardstick, thereby diluting the aforementioned principle of “common 
but differentiated responsibilities” adopted at the Earth Summit; (c)  that the efforts to 
green the world’s economy could induce developed countries to impose new trade restric-
tions on developing countries; and (d) that a green economy framework could lead to the 
attachment of new policy conditionality to international development assistance (ODA) 
and lending to developing countries.

Such  concerns  can  be  addressed  by  ensuring  that  the  green  economy  con-
cept  does  not  undermine  a  balanced  approach  to  sustainable  development.  Enhancing 
economic  growth,  social  progress  and  environmental  stewardship  can  be  seen  as  com-
plementary strategic objectives. As already indicated, because of the exponential increase 
in the level of human activity, the limits of the Earth’s capacity as both a source and a 
sink are being or already have been reached. Emphasizing the need for green economies 
can help focus attention on these constraints and limits. In this sense, the concept of a 
green economy stresses the importance of intergenerational equity in economic and social 
development, that is to say, ensuring that meeting the needs of the present generation does

not compromise the ability of future ones to meet their own needs; further, it is based on 
the presumption that the benefits of investing in environmental sustainability outweigh 
the cost of not doing so, because the cost of having to protect ecosystems from the dam-
ages associated with a “non-green” (brown) economy are larger that the projected costs of 
investing in sustainability.

The need for a fundamental technological  
and structural transformation

To ensure that no limits are crossed that would destabilize the Earth’s ecosystem, a funda-
mental technological overhaul and structural transformation of production and consump-
tion processes towards a green economy will be needed, entailing achievement of at least 
the following five objectives:

(a)  Reduction of resource requirements in general and of energy requirements in 

particular, in both absolute terms and relatively, per unit of output;

Remaining within the limits 
of the Earth’s capacity 
requires …

(b)  Substitution of renewable for non-renewable resources, given the total resource 

(c) 

use;
Substitution of biodegradables for non-biodegradables, at any given level of 
output or waste;

(d)  Reduction of waste (including pollution), at any given level of resource use;
(e)  Protection of biodiversity and ecosystems.

These green economy objectives are interrelated. For example, replacement of 
non-renewable by renewable resources helps to overcome resource constraints (first objec-
tive) and reduce waste (fourth objective). Similarly, reduction of resource extraction and 
waste generation is the most effective means of protecting biodiversity and ecosystems 
(fifth objective). To determine what is required to achieve these objectives, they must be 
examined in some detail.

Reducing resource requirements

Reduction of resource requirements, in both absolute terms and per unit of output, should 
be a key objective of greening the economy. Many observers have pointed out that there 
is much scope for drastically reducing resource intensity of production and consumption 
processes; and there is considerable evidence of greater resource efficiency, reflecting trends 
towards a “decoupling” of the growth of resource use from output growth. For exam-
ple, physical resource use per unit of output decreased by about half in Organization for 
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) member countries during the period 
1975-2000 (figure I.10). Moreover, the energy intensity of output has decreased substan-
tially since the 1970s, with global energy intensity now about 30 per cent lower than in 
1970. Energy intensity in both the United States of America and the United Kingdom of 
Great Britain and Northern Ireland is about 40 per cent lower now than in 1980 (Jackson, 
2009a, p. 48).13

However, despite this progress in reducing input intensity, the absolute world-
wide  volume  of  material  and  energy  utilized  in  production  and  the  amounts  of  waste 

13

It  should  be  noted,  however,  that  much  of  the  reduction  in  material  and  energy  intensity  of 
output in developed countries has been achieved by relocating material- and energy-intensive 
manufacturing operations within developing countries.

The substitution of 
renewable for non-
renewable resources can 
often lead to win-win 
solutions

generated continue to increase, as evidenced, for example, by the continued upward trends 
in world consumption of metals such as iron, nickel, bauxite, copper and zinc (figure I.11). 
While fast growth in some major developing countries is responsible in part for this con-
tinued trend, the fact remains that in developed countries, too, resource use has continued 
to  increase  despite  low  population  growth  and  improvements  in  resource  efficiency  in 
production (figure I.12). The evidence therefore makes it clear that despite some progress 
in relative decoupling, achieving the objective of absolute decoupling remains elusive.

Substitution of renewable for non-renewable resources

The Earth’s limits as a source of natural resources should be overcome further through 
the  substitution  of  renewable  resources  for  non-renewable  ones.  Since  many  renewable 
resources (for example, solar energy and wind power) are also less waste-generating, their 
substitution for non-renewable resources would result in a win-win solution, as it would 
allow constraints on the Earth’s functions as both a source and a sink to be overcome.

Thus  far,  progress  in  replacing  non-renewable  with  renewable  resources  has 
been too slow to significantly reverse ongoing trends. Since the first industrial revolution, 
there has been an unremitting increase in the total use of non-renewable energy sources, 
especially of fossil fuels like coal, gas and oil; and the rate of increase in their use has 
accelerated  since  1950.  As  a  result,  non-renewable  carbon-intensive  energy  sources  ac-
counted for about 85 per cent of total energy use in 2000 (figure I.13). Weaning human 
societies away from non-renewable resources and guiding them towards renewable ones 
have therefore become urgent tasks.

However, in some cases, production of renewable energy (for example, certain 
biofuels) can be more resource-intensive, so that replacement of non-renewable with re-
newable resources will not necessarily reduce overall resource requirements. Nevertheless, 
substitution of renewable resources for non-renewable ones is always desirable when such 
substitution does not increase and in fact decreases the overall volume of resources used 
and waste generated.

Substitution of biodegradables for non-biodegradables

Preponderance  of  non-biodegradables  in  output  and  waste  volume  has  become  a  serious 
threat to the Earth’s environment. As was shown in figure I.9, the weight of plastic in gross 
domestic product (GDP) has steadily increased over time and now far surpasses that of such 
natural inputs as timber, paper and metals. Unfortunately, most of the plastics currently 
used are non-biodegradable. Although some defenders of plastic maintain that widely used 
plastic bags will break down in 500 years, there is actually no reliable basis for such claims 
(Lapidos, 2007).

Fortunately, there is now increasing awareness of the harmful effects of plastic; 
as a result, many communities, cities and countries are taking measures to restrict its use. 
In the United States of America, for example, the State of California, in 2007, imposed 
restrictions on the use of plastic bags. Several cities in Europe have taken similar measures. 
Among developing countries, Bangladesh, for example, reimposed a ban on the use of 
plastic bags in 2002.

Introduction: why a green technological transformation is needed

Technologies already exist to produce biodegradable plastics. Currently avail-
able degradable plastic materials are of two main types: polyester polymers (biodegradable) 
and synergistic and hybrid polymers (bio-based) (Alire, 2011; Kaeb, 2011).

However,  efforts  to  substitute  biodegradable  plastics  for  non-biodegradable 
ones face a number of hurdles, including the difficulty of finding appropriate substitutes 
for certain types of non-biodegradable materials currently used in a range of applications; 
and the fact that, although the production of biodegradable and bio-based substitutes is 
technically feasible, the cost of producing them is generally higher.

Technologies for producing 
biodegradable plastics 
already exist

Reduction of waste

Although the limits to the Earth’s capacity as a source of resources has received more 
attention historically, limits to its capacity as a sink for waste are now proving to be a more 
constant focus. That the limits of Earth’s capacity as a sink are fixed is most evident in 
the context of the global warming threat, which is a direct result of excessive emissions of 
greenhouse gases, especially CO2 into the atmosphere. The threat of exceeding the Earth’s 
limits as a sink was made evident even earlier by the ozone hole resulting from excessive 
chlorofluorocarbon emissions. Thus, the reduction of waste (especially pollution) should 
be an overriding objective of the green economy.

The  task  of  reducing  CO2  emissions  is  particularly  daunting.  To  limit  any 
further  increases  in  the  Earth’s  temperature  to  less  than  2° C  above  the  pre-industrial 
average, as agreed internationally, the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere should not 
exceed 450 ppm. With a projected world population of 9 billion by 2050 and assuming 
2 per cent income growth per year on average between 2007 and 2050, the average CO2
emission intensity per unit of output will have to decrease from 768 grams in 2007 to 6 
grams by 2050 if destabilizing the climate is to be averted (figure I.14).

The reduction in material and energy intensity of output has helped reduce, 
to  a  certain  extent,  the  world  average  CO2  intensity  of  GDP  somewhat  (figure  I.15).14
However, as was the case with resource use, the reduction in the carbon intensity of GDP 
growth has not resulted in a reduction in the global volume of CO2 emissions (figure I.16). 
In fact, despite climate change-related efforts, the growth of CO2 emissions seems to have 
accelerated since 2001. Ironically, much of this increase has been due to increased emissions 
by Annex 1 countries, which under the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change15 were obliged to reduce their emission volumes.

Moreover, the composition of waste has further worsened, with the rising share 
of non-biodegradables having already been noted. The increasing share of electronic waste 
(“e-waste”), often containing radioactive elements, is another growing concern. In general, 
waste is becoming more hazardous, toxic and radioactive (Baker and others, 2004).

The limits of the Earth’s 
capacity as a sink for waste 
and pollution are fixed

The reduction in material 
and energy intensity of 
output has helped to 
reduce the average carbon 
intensity of GDP

Protection of biodiversity and ecosystems

Agricultural production by its very nature depends heavily on the quality of the environ-
ment. Unfortunately, the modernization of agriculture, which has led to significant in-
creases in food productivity, has not been conducive to conservation of natural capital, as 

14

15

The global carbon intensity declined by about one quarter from just over 1 kg of CO2 per United 
States dollar in 1980 to 770 grams in 2006. However, much of this decline seems to have been 
the result of a sharp decline in CO2 intensity of GDP in China up to 2000, after which the country’s 
downward trend suffered some reversals.

discussed in chapter III. In many areas, modern technologies and production systems have 
accelerated land degradation, clearing and degradation of forests, depletion of ground-
water sources and degradation of surface-water bodies, including rivers. Worldwide, the 
agriculture sector currently contributes about 14 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions, and 
related land-use and water management are not sustainable in many parts of the world. 
Deforestation  and  degradation  of  forests  are  contributing  an  estimated  17  per  cent  of 
global emissions, while causing the loss of habitat, species and biodiversity in general. At 
the same time, nearly 1 billion people are undernourished and face serious food insecurity. 
Global food production needs to increase by between 70 and 100 per cent from present 
levels by 2050 in order to feed a growing population. Thus, there is an urgent need to make 
agricultural production environmentally sustainable, while at the same time substantially 
raising productivity. It is hard to imagine how this can be achieved without a major over-
haul of existing production systems, technologies and supporting infrastructure.

The  incidence  of  natural  disasters  has  increased  fivefold  since  the  1970s,  as 
analysed in chapter IV of this Survey. With a fair degree of certainty, this increase can be 
attributed in part to climate change induced by human activity. Deforestation, degradation 
of natural coastal protection and poor infrastructure have increased the likelihood that 
weather shocks will turn into human disasters, especially in the least developed countries.
Further, in any society, loss of natural capital affects the poor and vulnerable 
more than the well off. Because of their greater reliance on, inter alia, smallholder agricul-
ture, open-capture fishing, harvesting of forest products, inter alia, the poor depend more 
on natural capital-related services.

Equitable growth within  
environmental boundaries

Principle 7 of the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, on the right to 
development, has  often  been  interpreted  in  terms of  economic  “convergence”,  whereby 
developing countries would be helped in catching up with developed countries as regards 
income levels and living standards. “Convergence upward” would require income levels 
and living standards in developing countries to grow faster to enable the gap with those 
of  developed  countries  to  be  closed.  According  to  the  parallel  notion  of  “convergence 
downward”, the per capita ecological footprints in developed countries should decrease so 
as to approach the low levels currently observed in developing countries.

Despite development efforts for more than half a century, progress with respect 
to development and poverty reduction remains uneven and patchy. Using the international 
poverty line of $1.25 per person per day (in 2005 purchasing power parity (PPP) value), 
as defined by the World Bank, 1.4 billion people, representing about 26 per cent of the 
developing world’s population, lived in poverty in 2005. The incidence of poverty was 50.4 
per cent in sub-Saharan Africa and 40.3 per cent in South Asia.

The world needs both 
“convergence upward” and 
“convergence downward”

Economic growth is a precondition for poverty alleviation

Economic growth is a precondition for poverty reduction and improvement in other eco-
nomic and social indicators. In the recent period, this has been illustrated by the experience 
of East Asia, in particular of China. As a result of its faster economic growth for more than 
three decades, China has been able to lift about 600 million people out of poverty. The 

Shared growth is necessary 
for poverty reduction

18

World Economic and Social Survey 2011

Growth in turn requires 
structural transformation 
and sector-specific policies

Growth must be achieved 
while at the same time 
respecting the limits of the 
Earth’s capacity

number of poor in China, as defined by the $1.25 cut-off, decreased from 835.1 million 
in 1981 to 207.7 million in 2005, which meant a drop in poverty incidence from 84.0 to 
15.9 per cent. Similarly, in Viet Nam, the poverty rate declined from 90.4 to 17.1 per cent 
between 1981 and 2005. By contrast, sub-Saharan Africa, a region that failed to achieve 
fast economic growth, also failed to achieve poverty reduction. As a result, the number of 
poor in this region increased from 212 million to 388 million during 1981-2005.

There is hardly any evidence of the achievement of sustained poverty reduction 
without fast economic growth over several decades. The impact of economic growth on 
poverty reduction depends very much on how it is shared. As Besley and Cord, eds., (2007, 
p. 1) note: “Growth is less efficient in lowering poverty levels in countries with high initial 
inequality or in which the distributional pattern of growth favours the non-poor.”

The capacity of an economy to generate new dynamic activities is key to its 
sustaining economic growth (Ocampo, 2011a). The emergence of new dynamic activities 
involves the movement of workers and resources from low-productivity to higher-produc-
tivity sectors, resulting in increased economic output and higher incomes. In a globalized 
economy, this process, in turn, requires identification of sectors in which a country has 
comparative advantage or in which the country can build up its comparative advantage for 
the future. Successful development and transformation therefore require the adoption of 
industrial (or production sector) policies and the necessary space within which to conduct 
such policies.

Growth and environmental protection

Rapid economic growth, based on existing technology, generally requires more input and 
generates more waste. Because of this factor, it is often suggested that there will be a trade-off 
between economic growth and environmental protection. However, this need not be the case. 
The precise objective of investing in greater resource efficiency and sustainable development 
is to overcome the need for such a trade-off. Moreover, as such investments will generate new 
economic activities, continued economic growth (especially for developing countries) may 
well be feasible without surpassing the limits of environmental sustainability.

A recent report of the United Nations Environment Programme (2011) esti-
mates that 2 per cent of current world gross product (WGP) would need to be invested 
annually between now and 2050 in order to shift development onto a path of green growth 
and thereby address the current broad range of environmental concerns. Utilizing model-
based projections, the report determines that the green economy scenario would permit the 
sustaining of higher—not lower—GDP growth than under the business-as-usual (BAU) 
scenario. These required investment estimates may be at the lower end, however. The World 
Economic and Social Survey 2009 (United Nations, 2009) and chapter II of the present 
Survey, report that about 2.5 per cent of WGP (or about $1.6 trillion) per annum would 
need to be invested to effect the energy transformation necessary to meet climate change 
mitigation targets alone. This analysis further suggests that public investments would need 
to be frontloaded in order to unleash private sector financing. Moreover, simulations using 
the United Nations Global Policy Model showed that such a green investment scenario 
would accelerate economic growth in developing countries (ibid.).

While the outcomes of such scenario analyses rest on the assumptions embed-
ded in the modelling frameworks, they do suggest that it may well be feasible to combine 
fast growth with environmental protection in developing countries.

Introduction: why a green technological transformation is needed

Limits to growth in developed countries?

The assumptions underlying the aforementioned global sustainable growth scenarios in-
clude the supposition that green technologies can be effectively scaled up quickly and that 
their costs will not prove to be prohibitive. However, as discussed in chapter II, there are 
reasons to temper such technology-related optimism, as enormous technical hurdles need 
to be surmounted to accelerate innovation and ensure widespread application of resource-
efficient  and  waste-reducing  technologies,  especially  those  related  to  energy.  Hence,  if, 
for instance, emission reduction targets cannot be met through accelerated technological 
progress  in  energy  efficiency  and  renewable  energy  generation,  it  may  be  necessary  to 
impose  caps  on  energy  consumption  itself  in  order  to  meet  climate  change  mitigation 
targets in a timely manner.

Proposals to put limits on economic growth can be viewed in this context. 
Advocates of such an approach emphasize, in particular, a voluntary acceptance of certain 
limits to output and consumption growth by developed countries, so as to cap the produc-
tion of waste and utilization of non-renewable resources. They base their proposals on a 
number of arguments: first, acceptance of limits by developed countries would make it 
easier for the world as a whole to stay within the Earth’s carrying capacity; second, ac-
ceptance of such limits by developed countries would result in a freeing up of more space 
for the growth of developing countries, thereby facilitating convergence upward; third, 
acceptance of limits by developed countries would also facilitate convergence downward, 
through a more rapid reduction of the ecological footprint in developed countries; and 
fourth, voluntary limits to growth would be beneficial for developed countries themselves, 
because a further expansion of the current pattern of consumption would damage the 
quality of life rather than improve it. On these bases, voluntary limits to growth in devel-
oped countries could be beneficial for both developed and developing countries.

The argument that there are limits to growth is not a new one. In the 1970s, 
studies commissioned by the Club of Rome had drawn attention to the limits of resource 
availability. The follow-up studies reiterated the necessity for accepting limits to growth, 
while putting more emphasis on the limits of the Earth as a sink. The need to consider 
placing  certain  limits  on  the  total  volume  of  world  output  and  consumption  was  also 
recognized by the Brundtland Commission in its report, which noted that the concept of 
sustainable development did imply limits, although they might need to be imposed gradu-
ally. The report recommended that “those who are more affluent adopt lifestyles within the 
planet’s ecological means”16 and, within the context of the responsibility of political lead-
ers who felt that their countries had reached a “plateau”, took note of the fact that “many 
of the development paths of the industrialized nations are clearly unsustainable”.17

Recently,  a  number  of  studies  have  put  increasing  emphasis  on  the  fourth 
argument above for limiting growth in developed countries. To make their case, many 
of them presented evidence from cross-country data showing that the quality of life does 
not improve much beyond a certain level of per capita income. For example, taking life 
expectancy as an objective measure of the quality of life, it can be seen that life expectancy 
does  not  increase  much  beyond  a  per  capita  income  level  of  about  $10,000.  Similarly, 
as  indicated  in  chapter  III  of  this  Survey,  cross-country  evidence  suggests  that  there 
are no significant additional gains in human development (as measured by the human

development index) beyond the energy-use level of about 110 gigajoules (GJ) (or 2 tons of 
oil equivalent (toe) per capita).

While capping the use of energy and other resources by setting limits to growth 
in developed countries might have worldwide benefits, to many the prospect of “prosperity 
without growth” may not be very appealing. One reason for the difficulty involved entails 
what Jackson (2010) refers to as the “dilemma of growth”—the fact that while the current 
pattern of growth is unsustainable, the current structure of the economy and of society 
is  such  that  an  economy  without  growth  is  unstable.  Acceptance  and  implementation 
of prosperity without growth will therefore require major structural transformations of 
economies and societies.

The great green technological transformation

With or without the acceptance of limits to growth in developed countries, putting global 
development on a sustainable path will require greening economic growth. The attainment 
of technological progress will be essential and in many respects will entail a major overhaul 
of existing production methods and consumption habits.

What kind of technological revolution?

Industrial development so far 
has meant material growth 
at the cost of environmental 
protection

The first industrial revolution 
ushered in an era of 
dependence on fossil fuels

As explained above, the technological overhaul is required to undo the undesired effects of 
the past technological revolutions, while preserving their positive achievements and pro-
pelling the relationship between humankind and nature to a new stage. Up until the first 
industrial revolution, humans had mostly been at the mercy of nature. The main source of 
energy was the muscle power of animals and of humans themselves. This dependence on 
muscle power limited the extent to which humans could extract natural resources and con-
vert them into consumption goods. As a result, the material standard of living remained 
low for thousands of years. However, the fact that growth during the pre-industrial era 
was  mostly  horizontal,  involving  expansion  into  new  territories  and  an  increase  in  the 
density of population, does not mean that impressive technological achievements were not 
produced in this period.18

The technological revolution that was at the heart of the first industrial revolu-
tion succeeded in abolishing the sovereignty of nature, so to speak, and in establishing the 
supremacy of humans over it. Many have deemed this revolution a Faustian bargain, by 
which mankind opted for continuously increasing material consumption at the expense of 
nature. Subsequent technological revolutions have only expanded the capacity of human-
kind to impose its will on nature—a victory attested by a sharp rise in population and rising 
levels of income and consumption. However, a point has now been reached where humans 
need to restore the sovereignty of nature, not because they lack the capacity to go on con-
quering it but because overtaxing nature’s capacity is detrimental to humans themselves.

What  are  the  concrete  dimensions  of  this  new  technological  revolution? 
Understanding the character of past technological revolutions can help answer this ques-
tion. The first industrial revolution had been preceded, accompanied and followed by many 
changes,  including  radical  transformations  in  social  organization  and  ideology,  as  aptly 
described by the nineteenth century classical economists and later by Karl Polyani (1944). 

18

On  the  basis  of  the  pre-industrial  experience,  the  work  of  most  classical  economists  was 
conceptualized in terms of a “stationary state” rather than of continuous growth. 

Introduction: why a green technological transformation is needed

From the technological perspective, however, the main change consisted in the replacement 
of muscle power by the steam engine as the main motive force. Yet, this came at a price, since 
steam engines require coal, which ushered in the era of humans’ increasing dependence on 
fossil fuels. The subsequent invention of electricity permitted energy to be applied among a 
vast range of machines in terms of scale and application; but as generation of electricity also 
relies primarily on fossil fuels, their use has grown exponentially (figure I.15).

While the first industrial revolution changed the nature of the energy source, 
enabled production using machines (instead of muscle) and increased the importance of 
metal (which was necessary to produce those machines), the second industrial revolution’s 
major achievement was the development of the chemicals industry, which resulted not 
only in the processing and refining of substances already available in nature but in the 
manufacture of new ones. Unfortunately, many of these new products, such as plastics, 
turned out to be non-biodegradable.

The introduction of new energy sources and new materials has gone hand in 
hand with the development of an ever increasing range of products, at least in developed 
countries. At the same time, progress has also led to the production of spurious articles of 
consumption and the shortening of product life, both of which have led to the waste of 
physical and human resources.

The new technological revolution will have to reverse the undesirable impacts 
of  the  past  technological  revolutions,  while  preserving  and  enhancing  their  positive 
achievements, which means: reversing the dependence on fossil fuels; reversing the trend 
towards increasing use of non-biodegradables; conserving resources by reducing the re-
source requirement per unit of output and the production of luxury consumption goods,

and by increasing the durability of goods produced; reducing waste by a switch to renew-
able inputs, and by making reuse and recycling of non-renewable inputs almost universal; 
reversing the process of land degradation and making it possible to feed the additional 3 
billion people who will inhabit the Earth by 2050, without exceeding its capacity; and 
making it easier for societies, particularly in more vulnerable parts of the world, to protect 
themselves against natural hazards which are becoming more frequent.

To be successful in achieving the goals set out above, the technological revolu-
tion for a green economy will possess certain features that are critically different from 
those of previous revolutions.

A technological revolution like no other

A compressed time frame

Unlike previous technological revolutions, which were by and large spontaneously unfold-
ing processes which could take as much time as they needed to attain their objectives, the 
green technological revolution must be carried out within a much more compressed time 
frame given the acuteness of the environmental crisis. Its gravity is reflected most clearly 
in the climate change threat, which, as already indicated, will require drastic cutbacks in 
greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 in order to avert risking catastrophic impacts. In other 
words, the related technological transformation will need to be accomplished over the next 
four decades. Many other dimensions of the environmental crisis—such as loss of species, 
land degradation and desertification, deforestation and loss of freshwater and groundwater 
reserves—call for a similar urgency and compressed time-frame. However, achieving the 
necessary technological transformation under such constraints will be a huge challenge, 
since it is well known that diffusion of technology is a slow process and that previous 
technological revolutions typically took much longer (about 70 years or more) (Wilson 
and Grübler, 2010; and chap. II).

Greater social guidance and a greater public role

Contrary  to  conventional  wisdom,  Governments  played  an  important  role  in  previous 
technological revolutions. For example, machine-based cotton textile production during 
England’s first industrial revolution would not have flourished without the support of the 
British Government’s colonial and trade policies, which ensured that colonies served as 
sources of raw materials and as captive markets. Steam engines would not have developed 
as they had without the Government’s decision to fit out all Royal Navy vessels with steam 
engines. The rise of the chemicals industry in the second industrial revolution derived 
great benefits from the protectionist policies of the Governments of the second-generation 
industrializing  countries.  More  recently,  the  development  of  nuclear  power  plants  has 
owed much to the war-related focus on the development of the atom bomb. Finally, the 
development  of  the  Internet  owes  much  to  the  communications-related  projects  of  the 
United States Department of Defense. At the same time, a large part of technological 
diffusion has depended on market-based processes.

Governments  will  have  to  play  a  much  more  central  role  in  inducing  the 
technological transformation needed to achieve the objectives of the green economy for a 
number of reasons. First, there is the aforementioned matter of the faster pace required:

left to spontaneous market forces. Equally important is the fact that the natural environ-
ment is a public good and consequently not “priced” by the market. Although there are 
markets for green technologies, they are just developing through the implementation of 
government policy. Governments will then have a key role to play in promoting more 
extensive research and development and diffusion of green technologies, inasmuch as the 
benefits accrue to societies as whole. In addition, since existing brown technologies are 
presently locked into the entire economic system, a radical shift to green technologies will 
mean  adjusting,  improving  or  replacing  much  of  the  existing  infrastructure  and  other 
investments. Such transformations will be costly and will require large-scale long-term 
financing, which it is unlikely will be mobilized in full through private initiatives. Hence, 
government support and incentives will be required. Thus, not only will strong technol-
ogy policies be required, but they will need to go hand in hand with active industrial 
and educational policies designed to generate the necessary changes in infrastructure and 
production processes.

Industrial policies will be needed to actively promote production activities and 
processes that reduce resource requirements, substitute renewable inputs for non-renewable 
ones and replace non-biodegradables with biodegradables. Such active government inter-
vention will be essential inasmuch as prices, as determined in unregulated markets, would 
not be reliable indicators of environmental impacts and long-term resource constraints 
and hence would be incapable of guiding decisions on incentives to investments and re-
source allocation for sustainable production. The core of this strategy should be a strong 
technology policy with a focus on adaptation and dissemination of green technologies and 
the treatment of green economic activities as “infant industries” which require appropriate 
support (subsidies, preferably time-bound, access to credit and perhaps some level of trade 
protection).  A  green  industrial  policy  would  give  preference  to  new  public  and  private 
investment  that  contributes  to  sustainable  development,  has  good  prospects  as  regards 
generating backward and forward linkages in the economy, and is aligned with broader 
development  priorities.  Such  actions  should  be  supported  by  public  sector  investments 
directed  towards  developing  the  necessary  infrastructure  and  providing  the  poor  with 
access to basic energy and water and sanitation. This would also include implementing 
appropriate  regulation,  pricing  policies,  taxes  and  subsidies  designed  to  limit  pollution 
and emissions, to control overexploitation of natural resources and to ensure that prices 
better reflect environmental values, as well as mainstreaming environmental criteria into 
government procurement policies. Under no circumstances, however, should the poor be 
penalized, especially when the products or services concerned are essential ones. Thus, if 
water is generally underpriced, then when its price is being revalued, a system of differen-
tial pricing should be put in place so as to ensure access for the poor.

Greater international cooperation

The green technological revolution will also necessitate greater international cooperation 
than was required in carrying out previous ones, as the result of several factors. First, the 
foci of many of the green technologies are regarded as public goods. The protection of 
these components of global commons, encompassing, inter alia, the atmosphere, oceans, 
open-capture fish stock, biodiversity and ecosystems, is not possible through efforts of in-
dividual nations only. Instead, cooperation of all nations is necessary for the development 
and deployment of technologies that can protect these commons.

24

… and hence the 
technological revolution 
will require global 
cooperation

Developing countries 
will have an important, 
role to play as “partners” 
in the new technological 
revolution

The development-related 
aspirations of developing 
countries offer both a 
challenge and an opportunity 
in the context of the green 
technological transformation

Second, through international trade and investment, incomes and consump-
tion in one country are linked to the ecological footprints left by the countries of pro-
duction.  Multilateral  environmental  agreements,  trade  and  investment  rules,  financing 
facilities  and  intellectual  property  right  regimes  would  all  need  to  be  aligned  so  as  to 
facilitate the green technological transformation. Since the majority, though not all, of 
existing new technologies are owned by the advanced countries and the cost of stimulating 
green technological change will be much higher for developing countries relative to their 
incomes, there will be important distributional considerations associated with greening 
the global economy, which will also need to be addressed through financing facilities and 
other new mechanisms of international cooperation.

The required greater international cooperation emphasized above must encom-
pass greater cooperation between developed and developing countries. During previous 
technological revolutions, beginning with the first industrial revolution, the role of devel-
oping countries was a limited one. Mainly, they were relegated to the status of colonies 
supplying material resources and providing captive markets. Based on their historical role, 
these countries continue, generally, to be viewed primarily as receivers of the technolo-
gies produced in developed countries. However, if the technology revolution for a green 
economy is to be successful, developing countries will need to be true partners in develop-
ing, utilizing and generally sharing the new technologies.

In actual fact, developing countries themselves now constitute quite a diverse 
group, embracing a wide range of technological capabilities. Countries such as China, India 
and Brazil are already playing a leading role in developing, manufacturing, deploying and 
exporting (including to developed countries) various green technologies (such as solar pan-
els, wind turbines and biofuel technologies). Moreover, global value chains, which extend 
across developed and developing countries and represent a new global division of labour, 
cannot  be  subsumed  under  the  traditional  technology  transfer  paradigm  based  on  the 
“provider-receiver” relationship. Instead, many developing countries are already partners 
in the innovation, production and deployment of green technologies. This role will likely 
become increasingly important and its impact more widespread in the future. Further, even 
developing countries that do not participate in the current global division of labour associ-
ated with engagement in the development and production of green technologies can play 
a significant role as potential markets for these greener technologies. Expansion of scale is 
the most important means by which the current high cost of many green technologies can 
be brought down. The large populations of developing countries can provide that scale if 
they, too, develop and can afford these new technologies and products. Thus, adaptation of 
green technologies by agents in developing economies will be essential in accelerating the 
processes whose aim is to make the green technologies commercially viable.

Thus, the development-related aspirations of developing countries pose both a 
challenge and an opportunity for the green technological transformation. Those aspira-
tions pose a challenge to the extent that the green economy-related objectives will have 
to accommodate developing countries’ pressing need to achieve higher levels of material 
welfare. At the same time, their aspirations present an opportunity, because many devel-
oping countries are still at the early stage of urbanization, entailing the transition from 
traditional to modern fuels and other hurdles. Hence, switching (or leapfrogging) to green 
technologies may prove easier in some developing countries than in developed countries, 
which face the task of converting already built brown technologies and infrastructures 
into green ones. Developing countries can therefore provide experiences of greening which 
may be instructive for developed countries.

Introduction: why a green technological transformation is needed

25

Societal transformations

Greening  the  economy  will  require  major  societal  transformations  for  reasons  related 
to supply and demand. On the supply side, policies and institutions required to foster 
the necessary technological transformation may not be implementable without a societal 
transformation. On the demand side, consumption habits and living patterns must adapt 
to changes in the nature and packaging of products and modern conveniences. Moreover, 
as noted above, the desired technological transformation might not evolve at the necessary 
pace and scale, so that supply-side changes may not prove sufficient: demand-side changes 
would then be required, such as those discussed above under “limits to growth”. These 
demand-side changes, however, could not be expected without a radical societal transfor-
mation. The examples below illustrate these interconnections.

Transforming settlement, transportation and consumption patterns

Much of the material and energy consumption of a society is determined by the settlement 
patterns, as illustrated by Japan’s compact form of urbanization, which partly explains 
why the energy intensity of its economy is significantly less than that of the United States 
of  America  (Duro  and  Padilla,  2011).  It  is  true  that  Japan’s  compact  urbanization  has 
been, to a large extent, dictated by the country’s mostly mountainous physical terrain, 
where whatever limited space for settlement and urban development exists is found around 
the mouths of rivers. Nevertheless, Japan’s experience does demonstrate that opting for 
compact urbanization is one way to keep material and energy requirements down.

Settlement and transportation patterns also influence consumption patterns. 
Spending on housing and household goods and services now constitutes the most impor-
tant share of personal consumption. By contrast, the share of food in total consumption in 
developed countries is now very limited. Meanwhile, spending on housing and household 
goods depends critically on the size of houses, which depends in turn on the settlement 
pattern. Compact urbanization generally leads to apartment living, whereas urban sprawl 
leads  to  residence  in  large-sized  houses,  which  require  more  energy,  more  furniture—
more, in fact, of almost everything.

The  world  is  poised  to  experience  further  urban  growth  in  the  near  future, 
especially in developing countries. Along with urban income growth, this will give rise to 
shifting consumption patterns. Protein-rich food consumption will rise, with commensu-
rate increases in the pressure on land stemming from the demand for its use in livestock 
production. The demand for non-food consumption should also be expected to rise along 
with resource use and waste production, if the demand is to be satisfied through prevailing 
technologies. Such trends will enhance the need for the green technological transformation, 
but they would also suggest that policies designed to influence consumer behaviour will be 
just as critical in facilitating the transition towards a sustainable development path.

Societal changes are 
necessary as both 
a precondition for 
and a complement 
of technological 
transformation

Societal changes 
can conduce to the 
achievement of necessary 
changes in consumption 
patterns

Changes in the social value system

The  required  technological  and  societal  transformations  necessary  for  greening  the 
economy and ensuring sustainable development and poverty reduction without exceeding 
the limits of the Earth’s capacity will not be possible without changes in the social value 
system. Communities have to begin placing greater value on the Earth’s natural environ-
ment as constituting a resource to be shared among current and future populations. Social 
and  political  discourse  and  public  priorities  must  increasingly  reflect  such  a  change  in

values; and societies must ensure that the tools they use for measuring social and economic 
trends, such as the concept of economic output,19 also reflect those values, so that feedback 
can be provided on the progress being made in respect of their integration in people’s lives. 
Changing individual and social values is likely to be an even greater challenge than that of 
transforming technology, production processes and consumption patterns.

The agenda

The dimensions of societal transformation that have been presented in this chapter extend 
beyond the scope of the present Survey. Still, by keeping these issues in the foreground, 
this  Survey  will  be  better  able  to  focus  on  the  technological  transformation  challenge 
within a few key areas. Chapter II explores the issues of transformation as related to the 
energy sector, where progress is critical to overcoming poverty, mitigating global warm-
ing and protecting the Earth’s natural environment. Chapter III, which calls for a truly 
green agricultural revolution, examines the challenges of protecting ecosystems and en-
suring sustainable management of land and forests. Chapter IV focuses on how human 
societies can protect themselves against the increasing incidence and intensity of natural 
hazards, many of which arise through profligate resource extraction and waste generation. 
Chapter V examines in detail national institutional arrangements that are conducive to 
the necessary technological transformation. The final chapter considers the issues of global 
coordination and institution-building, which are vital to the achievement of the green 
technological transformation.

Summary
A global sustainable energy transition needs to be achieved within four decades, a significantly 
faster rate than in the past.
Global sustainable energy policy must take into special consideration the 3 billion poor people 
who aspire to gaining access to electricity and modern energy services.
The scope of current national and global policies and programmes does not “add up” to the scale 
of actions needed to meet global emission reduction targets. Paradoxically, they are also overly 
ambitious  in  terms  of  their  expected  outcomes  and  are  inconsiderate  of  certain  biophysical, 
techno-economic  and  socio-political  limits  to  scaling  up  known  technologies.  A  reality  check 
of current plans is needed so that realistic and well-targeted initiatives can be devised at a far 
greater scale.
There is a need for comprehensive, strategic and systemic approaches that emphasize performance 
goals, niche markets and technology portfolios, especially those related to end-use. In order to 
take pressure off the technological innovation imperative, individual limits of 70 gigajoules (GJ) 
primary energy use per capita and 3 tons of carbon dioxide  (CO2) emissions per capita by 2050 may 
need to be considered. Such energy-use and emissions caps would not affect the development-
related aspirations of developing countries.
The sustainable energy transition offers significant economic opportunities for both developed 
and  emerging  market  economies,  but  poses  additional  development  challenges  for  poorer 
and  more  vulnerable  countries,  which  would  therefore  require  enhanced  support  from  the 
international community.

Introduction

Energy technologies1 have been greatly shaping society and the environment for the past 
two centuries. In fact, modern civilizations are largely dependent on fossil fuel energy 
technologies, which make high-density urban settlements possible. While technological 
progress has eliminated many problems, it has also added new and often unexpected ones 
(Grübler, 1998; Diamond, 2005). Emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) arising from the 
combustion of fossil fuels have been the main cause of anthropogenic global warming. All 
energy technologies, whether they are fossil-based or not, consume resources, use land and

For the purpose of the present chapter, energy technology shall comprise not only material inputs 
and  equipment,  but  also  software  (that  is,  explicit  and  tacit  knowledge  and  human  skills)  and 
“orgware” (that is, institutions, regulations and cultural norms) (Dobrov, 1979).

in terms of global warming and biodiversity loss, which is likely to lead to catastrophic 
environmental change (Rockström and others, 2009).

Despite  two  decades  of  climate  change  policies;  thousands  of  programmes, 
initiatives, regulations, market-based instruments and international agreements; and the 
disbursement of hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies, funds, research and develop-
ment (R&D) efforts and development aid, the declared goal of establishing a renewable 
low-carbon energy system on a global scale remains elusive. In 2005, fossil fuels accounted 
for 85 per cent of the global primary energy mix, while low-carbon nuclear power ac-
counted for 6 per cent, hydroelectricity for 3 per cent and biomass for 4 per cent. Modern 
renewables jointly accounted for less than 1 per cent.

Global CO2 emissions have increased at an annual rate of more than 3 per 
cent, considerably faster than in previous decades (van Vuuren and Riahi, 2008). The past 
decade was the first in two centuries with increasing CO2 emissions intensities, owing 
to a “coal revival”, in contrast with the rapid conversion to natural gas in the 1990s. In 
2010, the global share of coal reached an estimated 29 per cent, which in relative terms 
was higher than, and in absolute terms about twice as large as, at the time of the first 
oil crisis, in 1973. In the 2000s, China alone added more coal power capacity each year 
than the total installed capacity in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern 
Ireland (International Energy Agency, 2010b, p. 202). These trends, which are diametri-
cally opposed to declared greenhouse gas mitigation goals and targets, are by no means 
limited to emerging economies. Even in Germany, a country with one of the most ambi-
tious Government goals for greenhouse gas mitigation, 10 coal power plants were under 
construction and another 12 coal power plants were in the pipeline (Bundesnetzagentur, 
2009).  These  fossil-fuel-based  capacities  will  remain  operational  for  decades  and  make 
greenhouse gas reduction efforts increasingly difficult.

In contrast with the actual trend of ever more rapid increases in greenhouse 
gas emissions, global emissions would need to be reduced by 50-80 per cent by 2050 and 
turn  negative  in  the  second  half  of  this  century,  in  order  to  stabilize  CO2  concentra-
tions  at  about  450  parts  per  million  by  volume  (ppmv),  a  target  recommended  by  the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and agreed upon at the sixteenth 
session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention 
on Climate Change,2 held in Cancun, Mexico, from 29 November to 10 December 2010. 
Essentially, this would require making the power and transport sector carbon-free world-
wide by mid-century, in view of the limitations associated with replacing industrial proc-
esses based on fossil fuels. Today’s CO2 emitting devices and infrastructures alone imply 
cumulative emissions of about 496 gigatons (Gt) of CO2 from 2010 and 2060, leading to 
atmospheric concentrations of about 430 ppmv (Davis, Caldeira and Matthews, 2010). In 
other words, even an immediate global stop to building new fossil-fired capacities would 
lead  close  to  the  envisaged  global  target  of  450  ppmv  by  mid-century.  This  puts  into 
perspective the enormous ambition of the global target, given the long-lived capital stock 
and rapidly rising energy demand.

At the same time, about 40 per cent of humanity, or 2.7 billion people, con-
tinues to rely on traditional biomass, such as wood, dung and charcoal. Air pollution from 
inefficient stoves leads to an estimated 1.5 million premature deaths per year, more than 
from malaria, tuberculosis or HIV. About one fifth of humanity or 1.4 billion people,

continues to live without access to electricity, mainly in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa 
(International  Energy  Agency,  United  Nations  Development  Programme  and  United 
Nations  Industrial  Development  Organization, 2010).  Many  more, especially  in  urban 
areas, have access but cannot afford to make full use of it. The United Nations Secretary-
General’s Advisory Group on Energy and Climate Change proposed the goal of universal 
access  to  modern  energy  services  by  2030  (United  Nations,  2010a).  It  is  important  to 
note that bringing universal access to modern energy services to almost 3 billion people 
would require only about 3 per cent higher electricity generation, less than 1 per cent more 
demand for oil and less than 1 per cent more CO2 by 2030 (International Energy Agency, 
United Nations Development Programme and United Nations Industrial Development 
Organization,  2010).  Thus,  the  development  aspirations  of  the  world’s  poor  are  not  in 
conflict with efforts to solve the climate problem. The 500 million richest people, who 
constitute only 7 per cent of the world population, are responsible for half of all greenhouse 
emissions. They live in every country of the world and earn more than the average citizen 
of the United States of America. In contrast, the poorest 3.1 billion people are responsible 
for only 5-10 per cent of the total (Pacala, 2007; Chakravarty and others, 2009).

The global energy challenge is immense, as evidenced by the multiple global 
objectives explored by the Global Energy Assessment (GEA) (Riahi and others, forthcom-
ing): (a)  to ensure universal access to electricity and modern cooking fuels by 2030; (b)  to 
reduce premature deaths due to air pollution by 50 per cent by 2030; (c) to limit global av-
erage temperature change to 2° C above pre-industrial levels by 2100 (with a probability of 
greater than 50 per cent); and (d) to establish energy security, for example, to limit energy 
trading and increase diversity and resilience of energy supply by 2050. Meeting GEA ob-
jectives requires a complete transformation of the global energy technology system in the 
course of one generation, which is a considerably shorter time-frame than was the case for 
historical energy transitions. Governments have called for concerted actions to accelerate 
technology change towards cleaner energy technology. Many technology optimists believe 
such acceleration is essential and have in this regard coined the term “energy technology 
innovation imperative” (Holdren, 2006). Innovation in this context encompasses the full 
spectrum  ranging  from  incremental  improvements  to  radical  breakthroughs  and  from 
technologies and infrastructure to social institutions and individual behaviours (Wilson 
and Grübler, 2010).

Simplistic solutions dominate present national and global debates on how to 
meet  the  energy  technology  innovation  imperative.  Technology  optimists  suggest  “big 
push” policies to scale up available technologies. Others focus on market incentives and 
hope that the necessary technological transformation will come about by “getting prices 
right” through internalizing environmental externalities. Several Governments in Asia are 
pursuing energy technology-focused industrial policies, with mostly positive developmen-
tal benefits. However, evidence suggests that none of these approaches has the potential 
to sufficiently accelerate energy technology change on the required global scales. Indeed, 
most  Government  energy  technology  programmes  and  private  sector  projects  have  not 
met  their  overambitious  goals  in  recent  decades.  Reality  checks  are  needed  to  enable 
Governments to devise better policies and programmes at scales commensurate with the 
challenge. Better-focused and greater efforts to move to cleaner and renewable energy will 
be needed to ensure climate stabilization while allowing developing countries to satisfy 
their rapidly increasing demand for commercial energy which is linked to their develop-
ment aspirations. Historically, such huge challenges were addressed consecutively rather 
than concurrently.

ture visions of energy technology change in the twenty-first century.3

The global energy system

The global energy system is a planetary-scale complex network of energy converters and 
energy flows. Figure II.1 illustrates the associated global flows of “exergy”, that is, the en-
ergy available to be used, at the most aggregate level, from extraction at the primary level 
through the secondary, final and useful energy levels. It illustrates the dominance of fossil 
fuels and the low overall efficiency of the global system. It should also be noted that most 
greenhouse gas mitigation efforts focus on electricity supply, even though most losses are 
incurred from the final to the useful level. Useful energy is divided into motion (transport 
and machines), heat (mainly buildings) and non-energy (dominated by six materials). The 
underlying global reference energy system of interlinked energy technologies is even more 
complex. As the overall system is more than the sum of its components, for most purposes 
neither specific energy technologies (such as a wind power plant) nor specific parts of the 
system (such as renewable energy) should be analysed in isolation.

History of global energy transitions

Over the past 200 years, global energy use has grown by a factor of 25-530 exajoules (EJ) 
in 2009, compared with a sevenfold increase in population, driven by demand for higher-
quality energy services made possible by underlying energy technology change. Throughout 
the twentieth century, total energy use in developed countries had been much higher than 
in developing countries. In recent decades, however, energy demand in China, India and 
other emerging economies has grown rapidly, so that by 2009, more than half of primary 
energy was used in developing countries. This share is expected to continue to increase to at 
least two thirds over the coming decades. At present, 2.7 billion people continue to rely on 
traditional, non-commercial fuels typical for pre-industrial societies. They use only between 
15 and 50 GJ of primary energy per capita, delivering about 2-5 GJ of per capita in useful 
energy services. Growth of per capita energy use in developing countries has accelerated 
since 1975, whereas use in developed countries has stagnated (figure II.2).

There are persisting differences between the development trajectories of coun-
tries, spanning the extremes of highly energy-intensive and highly energy-efficient. Initial 
differences in resource endowments or social configurations can be perpetuated over time 
by differences in economic activity, technology adoption rates, consumption patterns and 
infrastructure, which shape the direction of path-dependent energy technology change 
(Wilson and Grübler, 2010). At 1990 levels of energy conversion efficiency, a minimum 
level of 40-50 GJ primary energy per capita would be associated with a decent quality of 
life (Smil, 2004). Cross-country evidence suggests that, typically, no additional human 
development gains are obtained through primary energy use above 110 GJ per capita at 
prevailing conversion efficiencies. Improving overall global energy conversion efficiency 
from the present 11 per cent to 17 per cent would result in provision of the same level of 
energy services using 70 GJ of primary energy per capita.

History of global energy technology transitions

There is no evidence of any 
differences in the speed of 
energy technology change 
across a wide range  
of technologies

Two  major  energy  technology  transitions  have  shaped  the  structure  of  the  global  en-
ergy system and the qualitative dimension of energy use since the onset of the industrial 
revolution (Nakicenovic, Grübler and McDonald, 1998). The first, associated with the 
emergence of steam power relying on coal (Landes, 1969), took more than a century to 
unfold (figure II.3). The second, characterized by the displacement of the coal-based steam 
technology  cluster  by  electricity  and  petroleum-based  technologies,  is  only  about  half-
complete, with 2.7 billion people still lacking access to modern energy services (Global 
Energy Assessment, forthcoming).

These transitions towards higher-quality energy fuels took place through suc-
cessive substitutions going from traditional fuels to oil, gas and nuclear. At the global level, 
these substitutions had occurred at intervals of 70-100 years for the 250 years until 1975 
(Marchetti  and  Nakicenovic,  1979).  Since  1975,  however,  this  process  has  slowed  to  a 
global transition time of about 250 years, primarily as a result of government interventions 
and politically induced high and volatile oil prices. In addition, at the level of plants and 
units, there is no evidence of any differences in the speed of energy technology change 
across a wide range of technologies since the nineteenth century (Wilson, forthcoming). 
The historical energy technology transitions have been characterized by a number of styl-
ized patterns (Wilson and Grübler, 2010):

End-use applications drive supply-side transformations
Quality/performance dominates cost in the initial market niches

Future scenarios

From 1950 to 1990, energy-related global greenhouse gas emissions increased by about 
3 per cent per year, mainly owing to increases in population (+1.8 per cent) and incomes 
(+1.9 per cent), the effect of which was moderated by lower energy intensity consumption 
patterns (-0.3 per cent) and better, lower-carbon technologies (-0.4 per cent) (Waggoner 
and  Ausubel,  2002).  Policy  has  typically  focused  on  technology  as  the  main  lever  for 
reducing emissions and it is indeed a powerful driver. Future energy technology change 
will be as important for determining future greenhouse gas emissions levels as long-term 
demographic  and  economic  developments  over  the  course  of  the  twenty-first  century 
(Roehrl and Riahi, 2000). Alternative technology strategies result in a divergence of emis-
sions levels only gradually, after several decades or more, owing to the long lifetimes of 
power plants, refineries, buildings and energy infrastructure (Grübler, 2004); but near-
term technology and policy decisions will have sown the seeds of subsequent divergences, 
translating into different environmental outcomes as new technologies gradually replace 
older ones.

Scenario analysis has helped to identify robust energy technology portfolios 
across a wide range of assumptions with respect to energy demand, resource constraints 
and availability and cost of technologies, and the extent of greenhouse gas constraints 
(Roehrl  and  Riahi,  2000;  Riahi,  Grübler  and  Nakicenovic,  2007;  Grübler  and  Riahi, 
2010). Figure II.4 illustrates the contributions of energy technologies to greenhouse gas 
emissions reductions, under a high-emissions baseline scenario, required for stabilization 
at a concentration of 550 ppmv CO2e by 2100. The top two “mitigation wedges” show 
the contributions (in annual gigatons of carbon (GtC)) of (supply-side) carbon intensity 
improvements and (demand-side) energy intensity improvements in the baseline relative 
to a “frozen” state of technological development in 2000. This difference illustrates the 
innovation challenge of incremental energy efficiency improvements. Popular claims that 
“the technology exists to solve the climate problem” reflect the idea that no necessarily dis-
ruptive revolutionary changes (for instance, to nuclear fusion) would be needed, but such 
beliefs underestimate the challenge of achieving continued incremental improvements in 
line with historical trends.

The ranking of these mitigation wedges is quite robust across scenarios, with 
energy conservation and efficiency accounting for more than half the emissions reductions. 
Indeed, across the wide range of scenarios, energy efficiency contributed about 59 per cent 
of the cumulative greenhouse gas emissions reductions from 2000 to 2100, compared with 
the much lower contributions of renewables (18 per cent), nuclear (9 per cent), fossil fuels 
(6 per cent) and other means (8 per cent) (Riahi, Grübler and Nakicenovic, 2007).

Several global scenarios have explored feasible levels of lower per capita energy 
use and low greenhouse gas emissions that do not compromise economic development. For 

Claims that “the technology

example, the GEA efficiency scenario shows that the world’s average primary energy use 
per capita can decrease from 71 to 63 GJ from 2010 to 2050, with average per capita gross 
domestic product (GDP) still tripling (in constant dollar terms). This implies an improve-
ment in eco-efficiency by a factor of 3.2, which is almost as ambitious as the “factor 4” 
goal of doubling wealth and halving resource use, originally suggested by von Weizsäcker, 
Lovins and Lovins (1998). Thus, even world average levels of energy use of less than 70 GJ 
per capita would be achievable by mid-century, in line with the target suggested by the 
present Survey (see below).

Efforts to accelerate energy technology change

The pace of the global 
energy transition has 
slowed significantly  
since the 1970s

The pace of the global energy transition has slowed significantly since the 1970s, despite 
national and international efforts to accelerate energy technology change in response to 
the oil crises of the 1970s, current concerns about global warming, and the goal of ensur-
ing universal access to modern energy services.

The international energy technology agenda

A complex system of organizations and institutions has emerged at the international level 
to promote energy technology cooperation and provide both financial resources for clean 
energy investments and price signals to favour low-carbon energy technologies; and a global 
system for the transfer of hundreds of billions of United States dollars is in the making.

The International Energy Agency (IEA) maintains 40 multilateral technology 
initiatives,  also  known  as  implementing  agreements,  covering  the  full  range  of  energy 
technologies, including programmes with voluntary participation designed to accelerate 
the deployment of clean energy technologies and cost-effective technologies for carbon 
capture and storage (CCS). Thus far, however, these international efforts have had a rela-
tively small effect on the global energy transition.

The clean energy technological transformation

35

The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) under the Kyoto Protocol to the 
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change,4 for instance, was expected to 
greatly stimulate clean energy technology transfer to developing countries and significantly 
reduce costs for developed countries. The market value of Clean Development Mechanism 
transactions had reached $6.5 billion in 2008, but dropped thereafter by about 60 per cent 
as a result of the financial crisis and uncertainty about the future climate policy regime. 
Looking ahead to 2012, renewable energy projects are estimated to make up 61 per cent 
of the total number of CDM projects, accounting for 35 per cent of certified emissions 
reductions  (CERs),  with  industrial  gas  and  methane  projects  accounting  for  just  under 
half of the remainder of CERs. If fully implemented, CDM projects contracted during the 
period 2002-2008 would require $106 billion worth of low-carbon investment, primarily 
in “clean” energy (Kossoy and Ambrosi, 2010). CDM investments have been concentrated, 
however, in a handful of large emerging economies, such as China, Brazil and India.

From  1991  to  2009,  the  Global  Environment  Facility  (GEF),  which  serves 
as  a  financial  mechanism  for  the  United  Nations  Framework  Convention  on  Climate 
Change, allocated more than $2.7 billion to climate mitigation activities while leverag-
ing an additional $17 billion in financing. In 2008, the World Bank also established the 
Climate Investment Funds which represent a collaborative effort among the multilateral 
development banks to address climate finance gaps. By 2010, contributors had pledged 
$6.4  billion  in  new  funds.  One  component,  the  Clean  Technology  Fund  finances  the 
scaling up of demonstration, deployment and transfer of clean technologies and focuses 
on  countries  with  significant  mitigation  potential.  The  first  round  of  investment  plans 
encompasses 13 countries, energy efficiency projects, bus rapid transit, concentrating solar 
power, and wind power.

The transfer of environmentally sound technologies is recognized under the 
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, but action on the ground has 
progressed relatively slowly. The Conference of the Parties at its sixteenth session, agreed 
to establish a Climate Technology Centre and Network, which aim to support technology 
transfer and local technology innovation capacity.

National plans for clean energy technology

Recent efforts in developed economies to support clean energy technology have typically 
focused on economic instruments for creating niche markets and promoting the commer-
cial diffusion of new technologies. Efforts of emerging and other developing economies 
to support clean energy technology have typically focused on domestic research, develop-
ment, manufacturing and export capacities. China’s Twelfth Five-Year Plan, endorsed in 
March 2011, encompasses a green growth strategy geared towards building technology 
leadership, through special efforts to develop and deploy wind, solar, hydro, nuclear, en-
ergy efficiency, electric cars, “smart grids”, infrastructure and high-speed rail. It includes 
a plan to install 10 million charging stations for electric cars and to increase installed re-
newable energy capacity by 47 per cent by 2020. It plans to invest €57 billion in new ultra 
high voltage (UHV) transmission lines by 2015, and €460 billion to develop smart grids, 
and to increase nuclear power capacity from 10 to 50 GW, although most investments 
will continue to be for “clean” coal. South Africa aims to slow its greenhouse gas emis-
sions growth and reduce those emissions after 2030, through increased energy efficiency,

feed-in tariffs for renewables, development of carbon capture and storage for coal-fired 
power plants and coal-to-liquid plants, a levy on coal-fired power and the introduction 
of  a  carbon  tax.  The  Republic  of  Korea  is  implementing  a  green  growth  strategy  and 
five-year action plan which aim for a 46 per cent reduction in energy intensity by 2030 
and for an 11 per cent share of renewable energy. The national energy plan for 2008-2030 
foresees  investments  in  low-carbon  transport,  hybrid  vehicles,  renewable  energy  tech-
nologies and the construction of 10 nuclear power plants. Mexico has set an indicative 
reduction target for its greenhouse gas emissions by 50 per cent from 2000 to 2050, and 
its Special Climate Change Programme makes provisions for wind power, cogeneration, 
efficient household appliances and lighting, promoting rail freight, and 600,000 efficient 
cooking stoves.

Energy plans of the poorest and most vulnerable economies have aimed to find 
a balance between Governments’ immediate priorities and the priorities of aid donors, 
in order to leverage development assistance. For example, energy plans and policies of a 
number of small island development States aim to address their special vulnerabilities and 
promote renewable energy. For example, Maldives announced its goal of achieving a car-
bon-neutral energy sector by 2020; Tuvalu aims to achieve 100 per cent renewable energy 
utilization by 2020; there have been positive experiences with thermal solar water heating 
in Barbados, Mauritius and Palau; hybrid solar-diesel power generation is being piloted in 
Maldives and Tuvalu; and geothermal energy is in the early phases of exploration in Saint 
Kitts and Nevis and Saint Lucia. Despite such commitments, however, fossil-fuel use has 
continued to increase faster than renewable-energy use in most small island development 
States (United Nations, 2010a).

National plans for universal access  
to modern fuels and electricity

Globally, less than 65 per cent of the rural population had access to electricity in 2008 
(International Energy Agency, 2009). Two thirds of the people without electricity access 
were in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Only 11 per cent of the rural population in 
sub-Saharan Africa have access to electricity. From 1970 to 1990, more than 1 billion peo-
ple had gained electricity access, half of whom were in China alone. From 1990 to 2008, 
almost 2 billion additional people secured electricity access (Global Energy Assessment, 
forthcoming). However, there is no evidence for acceleration or deceleration of electrifica-
tion over the past 100 years. Historically, the process of electrification has taken several 
decades in all countries. The United Kingdom and the United States needed about 50 
years to achieve universal access around 1950. Among the emerging economies, Mexico, 
China, Brazil, Thailand and Mauritius achieved universal access in the 1990s. India and 
South Africa, however, still have some way to go, as do all least developed countries. The 
time needed to achieve universal access to electricity has ranged from about 20 years in 
Thailand and 40 years in China to 90 years in Mexico. Countries with low population 
densities or those consisting of dispersed islands face special challenges. Electrification in 
remote islands remains limited owing to high capital costs, despite special efforts made 
by small island developing States. For example, Fiji completed about 900 rural electrifica-
tion community projects between 2005 and 2009, in order to be able to reach universal 
electricity access by 2016 (United Nations, General Assembly, 2010b).

The  benefits  of  electrification  are  clear.  For  poor  households  in  developing 
countries, having household lighting has been estimated to add between $5 and $16 per 
month in income gains. The added benefits of access to electricity in general would be in 
the order of $20-$30 per household per month through enhanced entertainment, time 
savings, education and home productivity (World Bank, Independent Evaluation Group, 
2008). These benefits outweigh by far the $2-$5 per month that poor households typically 
pay for the cost of electricity.

Energy efficiencies of kerosene, candles and batteries for lighting are very low. 
As a result, lighting services with kerosene cost as much as $3 per kilowatt-hour (kWh), 
which is higher than the cost of lighting with solar electricity, at about $2.2 per kWh in 
poor countries. In poor countries, diesel generators and micro-utilities typically provide 
lighting at a cost of $0.5-$1.5 per kWh, compared with centralized traditional utilities 
which often provide lighting at an effective cost of less than $0.3 per kWh. However, for 
traditional utilities, providing services to poor households becomes economically interest-
ing only at demand levels of higher than 25 kWh per month, whereas poor households 
already derive great benefits per unit of cost in the range of 1 to 4 kWh per month.

For the poorest people in developing countries, cooking (and space heating in 
cold climates) can account for 90 per cent or more of the total volume of energy consumed 
(World Energy Council and Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 
1999). Relatively simple and inexpensive improved stoves can reduce by as much as 30 per 
cent the amount of fuel needed for cooking (Global Energy Assessment, forthcoming). 
Some of these cooking stove programmes, including their costs, are described below.

National energy technology innovation strategies

An increasing number of Governments—notably, those of China, Japan and the Republic 
of Korea—and the European Union (EU) have adopted or followed some kind of national 
energy technology innovation strategy. Such strategies are typically part of national inno-
vation systems, as discussed in chapter V, and provide a framework for coherent packages 
of policies and programmes that encompass all stages of the technology life cycle. The 
EU Lisbon Strategy provides a broad framework for a set of research, development and 
demonstration (RD&D) framework programmes. The fact that Japan has long focused 
on the promotion of performance targets for specific technologies has made the country 
the world leader in energy efficiency. China and the Republic of Korea have implemented 
industrial policies that focus on rapid adoption, local research, and manufacturing and 
deployment capacity, supported by flexible financial and regulatory support to accelerate 
qualitative improvements.

In China, energy technology R&D has expanded rapidly and is dominated 
largely by Government-owned enterprises which provide 85 per cent of all energy-related 
R&D.  Similar  to  those  of  Organization  for  Economic  Cooperation  and  Development 
(OECD) member countries, the energy R&D portfolio is dominated by supply-side op-
tions, of which more than half entailed fossil fuel-related technologies and 30 per cent, 
electric power, transport and distribution. Most recently, the Government has strength-
ened its patent system, with the number of filings having boomed since 2002, which will 
soon make China’s patent office the world’s largest. The wind power sector offers a good 
example of China’s rapid creation of local capacities. The market share (of cumulative in-
stalled wind power capacity) of foreign manufacturers in China declined from 75 per cent 
in 2004 to 38 per cent in 2008, while the share of domestic manufacturers increased from

Investments in research, development and demonstration 
(RD&D), market formation, and diffusion

Table II.1 provides global estimates of public and private investments in energy innova-
tion, market formation, and diffusion (Wilson and Grübler, 2010; Grübler and others, 
forthcoming).  In  2010,  investments  in  commercial  diffusion  amounted  to  between  $1 
trillion  and  $5  trillion,  substantially  more  than  the  $150  billion-$180  billion  invested 
in market formation and the $50 billion for RD&D. RD&D and Government-driven 
market formation investments focused on power and fuel supply, whereas the majority of 
private sector diffusion investments were for end-use and efficiency.

Investment in research, development  
and demonstration (RD&D)

Only one fifth of the $50 billion in public and private RD&D investments was for end-
use technologies and energy efficiency in 2010. The R&D intensity of the energy supply 
industry was comparable with that of the textile industry, but much lower than that of 
manufacturing. Public investment in energy-related RD&D continues to be low in devel-
oped countries, amounting to 5 per cent of total public RD&D. It had increased rapidly in 
response to the oil crises of the 1970s, but collapsed in the mid-1980s in line with falling 
oil  prices  and  privatization,  only  to  recover  from  2000  in  response  to  concerns  about 
global warming. Today’s level of public spending for energy-related RD&D in developed 
countries is still well below that of the 1970s and early 1980s, even though overall (not 
just energy) RD&D budgets have doubled since the 1980s (Nemet and Kammen, 2007). 
Public spending on RD&D of nuclear, fusion, fossil fuels and renewable energy technolo-
gies is lower in each case than in 1980.

Over  the  past  20  years,  emerging  economies  have  become  leaders  in  terms 
of public RD&D expenditures. They are also emerging as leaders in terms of renewable 
energy patents. Energy RD&D in Brazil, the Russian Federation, India, Mexico, China 
and  South  Africa  was  about  $19  billion  (in  PPP  terms),  which  is  more  than  the  total 
public energy RD&D budget of all IEA countries combined (estimated at $12.7 billion 
in PPP terms). This challenges the conventional wisdom that new energy technologies are 
developed in OECD countries and transferred to developing countries. Energy RD&D 
investments in emerging economies were focused on fossil fuel and nuclear energy, with 
renewables and energy efficiency underrepresented (table II.2).

Investment in market formation

Market-formation  investments,  which  include  public  and  private  investments  in  the 
early stages of technological diffusion, are sometimes also referred to as “niche market” 
investments.  These  include  public  procurement  and  government  subsidies  for  certain 
technologies, as well as private investments involving renewable performance standards, 
carbon taxes and feed-in tariffs (chap. V). About $100 billion out of the total of $150 bil-
lion-$180 billion in global investments for market formation was for electricity generation, 
transmission and distribution, $20 billion-$60 billion for renewables and about $5 billion 
for end-use and efficiency. The niche market investments for renewables are expected to 
increase rapidly in the coming years, in view of current Government plans in developed 
and developing countries alike. International Energy Agency (2010b) has estimated that 
government support for renewables will rise from $57 billion in 2009 to $205 billion in 
2035 (figure II.5).6 By comparison, fossil-fuel consumption subsidies amounted to $312 
billion in 2009 (ibid.). These numbers do nonetheless indicate that Governments favour 
renewables, since, excluding grid investments, Government subsidies for modern renewa-
bles amounted to $9.7/GJ compared with $0.8/GJ for fossil fuels.

6 

This assumes that world average support per unit will drop from 5.5 cents/kWh in 2009 to 2.3 
cents/kWh in 2035, but does not take into account the additional costs of integrating intermittent 
renewable sources into the network.

Investment in diffusion

Global supply-side energy investment was about $740 billion in 2010, with $70 billion 
for renewables. These investments were dominated by electricity generation, transmission 
and distribution (51 per cent) as well as upstream investments in fossil fuel supply (46 per 
cent), including the oil exploration and production component and the gas exploration 
and  production  component  which  accounted  for  19  and  13  per  cent,  respectively.  The 
most important renewables investments were in large-scale hydropower (annual capacity 
additions of 25-30 gigawatts (GW)) and biofuels ($20 billion, of which $8 billion was for 
Brazil’s ethanol). Global investment in energy end-use technologies was more than double 
the  supply-side  investments,  and  reached  an  estimated  $1.7  trillion  in  2005,  of  which 
almost $1.2 trillion was for road vehicles (Grübler and others, forthcoming).

Public-private  partnerships  in  energy  investments  have  become  increasingly 
popular, accounting for almost $40 billion in the first semester of 2009 despite the global 
financial crisis. Other private sector investments in energy technology include investment 
by  angel  investors,  companies’  internal  investments,  debt  instruments,  project  finance, 
mergers  and  acquisitions,  and  investments  in  publicly  listed  energy  technology  firms. 
Energy-related venture capital investments boomed in EU and North America in recent 
years, reaching $15.5 billion, or 10 per cent of all private investments in energy technology 
diffusion in 2008 (International Energy Agency, 2009). Most of these investments were 
for  solar,  biofuels,  biomass,  battery  technologies,  smart  metering,  software,  and  high-
efficiency engines.

Government energy technology programmes

The following selected examples of government energy technology programmes offer im-
portant lessons for future programmes.7 Most of the programmes have focused on power 
supply or alternative fuels.

Ethanol in Brazil, the United States and Mauritius

In response to the oil crisis and the erosion of trade preferences for sugar exports, Brazil’s 
military Government launched the world’s first large-scale ethanol programme in 1975, 
with producer subsidies and user incentives aimed at a rapid shift towards dedicated en-
gines running on ethanol. In response to low gasoline prices in the mid-1980s, a national 
research programme was started which achieved a reduction in production costs from $35/
GJ (in 2004 United States dollars) to less than $10/GJ in 2009, mainly through higher 
yields. In Brazil, ethanol derived from sugar cane has a high energy return of 8.3 times 
the energy input (ranging from 3.7 to 10) and high yields of about 5,500 litres per hectare. 
In addition, the introduction of flexible fuel engines (developed with foreign automobile 
companies) allowed users to choose the desired mix of ethanol and gasoline, thus creating 
fuel competition and a hedge against lower future oil prices from 2003. The cumulative 
subsidy aimed at making up for the difference between the higher ethanol production cost 
and world oil prices between 1975 and 2004 amounted to an estimated $50 billion. Rising 
oil prices in recent years meant that ethanol production costs became cheaper than world 
oil prices after 2004. Flexible fuel engines have been highly successful, reaching 81 per 
cent of the light-vehicle registrations by 2008 (Brazil, Associação Nacional dos Fabricantes 
de Veículos Automotores, 2008). In this context, it should be noted that, in January 2009, 
gasoline prices were again lower than ethanol production costs owing to the global reces-
sion, but this had again been reversed by January 2011.

In the United States, commercial production of fuel ethanol from corn had 
started in 1980, reaching 5 billion litres in 1995 and 35 billion litres in 2008. In 2007, the 
United States Congress passed a bill that mandated the production of 140 billion litres of 
corn ethanol by 2022, which would be equal to about 13 per cent of United States gasoline 
demand. If this goal were to be achieved domestically, it would require using the entire 
United States corn harvest.

In  recent  years,  many  developing  countries  in  tropical  zones  have  tried  to 
learn from Brazil’s experience with ethanol, and experimented with various local crops. 
An  interesting  case  is  that  of  Mauritius,  which  created  a  local  sugar  cane  and  biofuel 
research institute. While lower sugar cane yields and a smaller scale of operation led to 
ethanol prices that were about twice as high as those of Brazil, Mauritius has successfully 
deployed economical bagasse-based cogeneration. It should be noted, however, that, even 
if all tropical countries attained sugar cane yields as high as Brazil’s and all of the world’s 
sugar cane production (19 million hectares in 2005) were shifted to ethanol production, 
the resulting yield would meet only about 6 per cent of the world’s gasoline demand.

Energy Assessment (Grübler and others, forthcoming), which also provides a series of detailed 
case studies.

Coal-based synthetic fuels in the United States

In response to the second oil crisis, the United States embarked on a large-scale programme 
to  produce  synthetic  fuels  from  coal.  In  1980,  it  had  established  the  Synthetic  Fuels 
Corporation which was to improve technologies and produce 2 million barrels of liquid fuel 
per day by 1992, at a cost of $60 per barrel, in order to replace about 25 per cent of United 
States oil imports. Against the backdrop of the collapse of oil prices, the programme was 
cancelled after five years, with production having reached only 10,000 barrels per day and 
incurred costs having amounted to $5 billion (at 1980 prices) (Gaskins and Stram, 1991). 
Despite its failure to reach its envisaged goals, the programme did develop coal-gasification 
technologies that paved the way for highly efficient integrated gasification combined cycle 
(IGCC) coal power plants which were deployed around the world from the 1990s.

Hydrogen production in the United States

In contrast with the large diffusion investments in ethanol and synthetic fuels, support 
for hydrogen production and handling (that is, materials science) has been small-scale and 
limited to R&D. However, hydrogen has found a performance niche in certain industrial 
processes.  Annual  production  in  the  United  States  from  1971  to  2003  increased  more 
than 10-fold and production costs were reduced by a factor of 5, without any subsidies 
and despite the material challenges associated with handling hydrogen (Ausubel, 2007). A 
hydrogen pipeline is being operated between Louisiana and Texas; and some are consider-
ing the old idea of mixing hydrogen into the national natural gas pipeline system.

Nuclear power in the United States

Experience with nuclear power offers a prime example of an ambitious “big push” experi-
ment which Governments have carried out in order to accelerate development, deploy-
ment and diffusion of a new energy technology. As noted earlier, more than half of all 
cumulative energy-related public RD&D support in IEA countries since 1974 has been for 
nuclear power technologies. Exuberant expectations by early promoters of nuclear power 
from the 1950s are reflected in the statement by Lewis Strauss in 1954 that nuclear power 
would  become  “too  cheap  to  meter”.  In  the  beginning  of  the  1970s,  the  International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) had expected global installed nuclear power to reach at 
least 2.5 terawatts (TW) by 2000, as compared with what was in fact the actual total 
of  351  gigawatts  (GW).  The  first  nuclear  power  plant  started  operating  in  the  United 
Kingdom in 1956. In the United States, as many as 65 plants were ordered between 1965 
and 1969, and by the end of 1970, the country had 107 units on line, under construction 
or purchased. Rapid scaling up of unit size to beyond 1 GW brought costs down to less 
than  those  of  coal  power  plants  in  the  early  1970s.  Thereafter,  increasingly  large  cost 
and construction time overruns made nuclear power increasingly uncompetitive. Between 
1978 and very recently, no new plant was ordered in the United States. Reasons included 
low  oil  prices  (for  much  of  the  1980s  and  1990s)  and  increasing  costs  associated  with 
safety regulation. The “Atoms for Peace” programme launched by the United States in 
1953 was a typical Government big-push technology undertaking which shortened the 
formative phase during which, typically, different designs are tested. In the end, the design 
of the pressurized water reactor used in nuclear submarines became the sole dominant 

The fact that, initially, safety 
was not a key performance 
criterion for nuclear power 
has had far-reaching 
consequences

operational commercial reactor design. Yet, it was compactness and little need for refuel-
ling that had been the main performance criteria of reactors in submarines. Safety was not 
a key performance criterion, which has had far-reaching consequences. When accidents in 
commercial nuclear power plants made it increasingly clear that safety had to be increased, 
it was achieved with retrofitting and increased regulation. By the year 1978, an average of 
1.3 new regulations were being added every day in the United States. The result was the 
introduction of additional risks related to an increasingly complex technology system and 
cost overruns due to retrofitting. In short, the well-intended Government push for rapid 
commercialization of nuclear power without a link to appropriate performance criteria 
led to lock-in of inferior designs. Alternative designs, such as passive safety systems and 
high-temperature reactors, came too late.

Wind power in Germany, Denmark, the United States,  
the Netherlands, China and India

The first wind power plants had been developed in the 1880s, but it was not until the 1970s 
that the currently dominant design was settled upon and deployed. Denmark, the United 
States, Germany, the United Kingdom, Sweden and the Netherlands were early movers in 
wind energy innovation but followed different approaches. In the 1970s and 1980s, Germany 
and Sweden had focused on public R&D support for a quick scaling up to a range of 2-4 
megawatts (MW), but provided only limited support for market formation. Premature scal-
ing up failed to build a sustainable industry (Meyer, 2007) and established utilities had little 
incentive to deploy high-cost, intermittent wind turbines which were difficult to maintain. 
Denmark, the Netherlands and the United States focused on R&D and deployment of 
smaller-scale and simpler wind turbines in niche markets. Denmark established a test sta-
tion for wind turbines in 1978, issued type approvals from 1979 and introduced investment 
and production subsidies in the same year (Grübler and others, forthcoming). The result 
was sustained growth of the industry, the entry of new actors (farmers and municipalities), 
and very high reliability (98 per cent in 1985) (Heymann, 1998). While the Netherlands 
had also established a test field in 1981, it focused on competition rather than cooperation 
among manufacturers, which led to much slower progress and to lower reliability. In the 
United States, a number of subsidy schemes were introduced that led to a boom in wind 
power so that, by 1986, California had installed 1.2 GW of wind power which, at the time, 
constituted 90 per cent of the world total. However, “subsidy harvesting” by the private 
sector spurred hasty development and inadequate operational testing. By 1985, only 38 per 
cent of wind-power plants in the United States were operating properly; and the industry 
collapsed in 1986 when Government subsidies were reduced.

From the 1990s, many increasingly large wind power projects were undertaken 
in Denmark, Germany and Spain. The cost per kWh of wind power was halved between 
1980 and 2000, and reliability, efficiency, level of turbine noise, and grid stability greatly 
improved. Germany introduced feed-in tariffs, and average wind farm and turbine prices 
declined by 30 per cent from 1991 to 1996 (a learning rate of 10 per cent), with export prices 
at about half the average domestic price (Junginger, Faaij and Turkenburg, 2005). Germany’s 
feed-in tariffs effectively cross-subsidized technology transfer and the development of wind 
power industries in other countries, including China and India. From 1996 onward, prices 
began to increase in Germany, owing to rapidly expanding demand both domestically and 
for exports to emerging economies and later owing to higher commodity prices.

China and India have used 
industrial policy, including 
legal provisions, duties, 
taxes and subsidies, to 
support domestic wind 
power research and the 
wind power industry  
since the 1990s

China  and  India  have  used  industrial  policy,  including  legal  provisions, 
duties,  taxes  and  subsidies,  to  support  domestic  wind  power  research  and  the  wind 
power  industry  since  the  1990s  (see  chap.  V).  Further,  China  mandated  domestically 
produced components and, along with India, instituted domestic technology certifica-
tion programmes. As in the case of Europe, wind power plants were not necessarily built 
in  the  most  suitably  windy  locations:  the  local  policy  environment  was  a  much  more 
important factor. For example, in India in 2004, 57 per cent of wind power capacity was 
installed in Tamil Nadu which only has 7 per cent of the wind resources (Global Wind 
Energy Council, World Institute of Sustainable Development and Indian Wind Turbine 
Manufacturing Association, 2011). By the end of 2010, 194 GW of wind power capacity 
had been installed worldwide (figure II.6), of which 84 GW were in EU, 40 GW in the 
United States, 42 GW in China and 13 GW in India. In 2010, 35.7 GW of new capacity 
were installed, which was 6 per cent less capacity than in 2009. More than half of this 
new capacity was installed in China (16.5 GW) and India (2.1 GW), compared with 9.8 
GW in EU and 5.1 GW in the United States (Eurobserver, 2011).

Photovoltaics in Germany, the United States, 
Japan, China and Kenya

Solar photovoltaics (PV) was invented in the United States but was not deployed there on 
a large scale. For several decades, through its R&D, and its “Sunshine Programme” from 
1994 to 2004, Japan refined the technology and successfully reduced the costs of a 3kW 
roof system from 6 million to 2 million yen. The Sunshine Programme was remarkable in 
that it phased out its solar PV subsidies (which peaked at about $250 million in 2001) over

the duration of the Programme. Despite its low insolation levels, Germany is today by far 
the largest solar PV market in the world, owing to its generous feed-in tariffs. China pro-
duces and exports the majority of solar panels, most of which are sold in Germany, which 
remains the producer of machines needed in the manufacturing plants. Most recently, 
off-grid solar PV has become increasingly popular in poor areas without access to electric-
ity, in view of the prevailing high electricity prices and low demand levels. The examples 
of Kenya and Bangladesh are described in chapter V.

Solar water heaters in the United States and China

Research in United States national laboratories and universities had improved solar wa-
ter heater technology in the 1970s. A key breakthrough was the production of selective 
coatings which would absorb more sunlight. Driven by United States Federal and State 
subsidies and expectations of high future energy prices, the solar water heater industry 
boomed from the late 1970s and a $1 billion industry was created. In the 1980s, there 
was rampant abuse of generous subsidies (subsidy harvesting) which resulted in poorly 
installed systems. Within a few years, about half the systems were no longer functioning 
(Taylor,  2008).  In  1984,  tax  credits  for  new  installations  expired  and  the  solar  water 
heater industry in the United States collapsed, with the technology being by and large 
abandoned  for  two  decades.  The  perception  of  poor  reliability  persists  and,  with  the 
industry’s size currently at about $30 million, has proved difficult to overcome. More 
successful was a programme in Hawaii that made consumer rebates contingent on an 
inspection.  The  technology  is  currently  cost-effective,  especially  in  large  installations 
with high demand for hot water. While the quality of the technology has improved since 
1976, unit costs have not been reduced significantly and, instead, have been determined 
mainly by the price of steel and glass (Taylor and others, 2007). In contrast, solar water 
heaters have been rapidly adopted in China which now accounts for most of the 100 GW 
capacity that is installed worldwide today.

Concentrated solar power in the United States,  
Germany, Spain and North Africa

The United States, Germany and Spain have led long-standing research programmes in 
solar thermal electricity, which included experimentation with a variety of designs.8 The 
first modern concentrating solar power (CSP) plant with 1 megawatt (MW) capacity had 
been  built  in  Italy  in  1968.  The  parabolic  trough  design  of  a  354  MW  plant  built  in 
California in 1984 became dominant. Different types of working fluids (such as molten 
salt), which are a key determinant of the efficiency, have been used. Overall deployment 
remains much lower than that of wind power, owing to higher cost and water-use conflicts 
in desert areas. In the United States, costs of producing CSP are about 12-18 cents per 
kWh compared with 2 cents for nuclear power, although costs as low as 5 cents might be 
achievable in the future with heliostat mirrors and gas turbine technology.

An industrial consortium, consisting mainly of German companies, has re-
cently been formed with the goal of constructing a country-size CSP facility in North 
Africa and linking it to the EU power grid with high-voltage alternating current (HVAC)

Designs include the parabolic trough, the dish stirling, the concentrating linear Fresnel reflector 
and the solar power tower.

lines. The initiative is commonly known as DESERTEC. The consortium has plans for a 
€400 billion CSP facility together with solar PV and wind power over an area of 17,000 
square  kilometres  (km2)  in  the  Sahara  which  might  deliver  as  much  as  15  per  cent  of 
Europe’s power by 2050. Besides the costs, the main obstacle to the realization of the 
DESERTEC goal continues to be geopolitical in nature.

Micro-hydroelectricity and biogas in China

China  has  the  largest  hydroelectricity  potential  in  the  world.  During  the  “Great  Leap 
Forward” (which started in 1958), there had been plans to build 2.5 GW of micro-size 
hydroelectricity plants by 1967, but only about 0.5 GW were completed (Carin, 1969). In 
a new wave of construction from 1970 to 1979, their number increased from 26,000 to 
90,000, with mean size doubling to only 70 kW. Much larger hydro plants in the MW and 
GW ranges have been built since the 1980s. Many technical and maintenance problems 
(silting, drought, leaks) with hastily built microplants meant low load factors and rela-
tively high costs (Smil, 2010a). In 2006, China completed the world’s largest hydropower 
plant, with a capacity of 18.2 GW. From the early 1970s, China had promoted microscale 
biodigesters running on animal dung, human faeces, garbage and waste water. A 10 cubic 
metre  (m3)  biodigester  was  deemed  sufficient  to  provide  biogas  for  a  family’s  cooking 
and lighting needs. Some 30,000 were completed by 1973 and 400,000 by 1975. China’s 
official target for 1985 was 20 million units, but in reality their numbers fell to less than 
4 million by 1984, as millions of the units were abandoned owing to lack of the necessary 
skills for maintenance (ibid.).

Efficient cook stoves in developing countries

The Global Energy Assessment reviewed 51 programmes, conducted since 1980 in 8 Asian, 
12 African and 9 Latin American countries, whose aim has been to distribute clean cook-
ing stoves to poor households. Included in the review were costs, efficiency and technolo-
gies used. The review highlighted the wide range of cooking-stove models tailored to local 
needs, fuel supply, available technical skills and affordability. Energy efficiencies ranged 
from 15 per cent for simple mud stoves running on straw and twigs (several thousands of 
which were constructed by trained artisans in Viet Nam at a cost of $1.8) to as high as 
40 per cent in the case of a programme in China involving 300,000 clay stoves running 
on  coal  briquettes  and  constructed  in  local  workshops  since  the  1980s.  There  was  no 
evidence of systematically increased efficiencies or reduced costs over time. Programmes 
in  Latin  America  tended  to  be  smaller  in  size,  but  were  mostly  subsidized  to  varying 
degrees, including 100 per cent in some cases in Guatemala, Bolivia (Plurinational State 
of) and El Salvador, whereas in Asian and African countries, there was a wide range of 
subsidy levels, depending on the type of stove. Noteworthy are the large-scale programmes 
designed to distribute since the 1990s more than 5 million Chulha stoves, running on a 
range of fuelwood, straw, dung and agricultural waste, with efficiencies between 20 and 
28 per cent, and delivered at costs of only $1.80-$4.60, depending on the subsidy levels 
(which ranged from zero to 78 per cent subsidy). Manufactured metal stoves in India, 
Zimbabwe, Rwanda, Mali, the Niger, Burkina Faso and Guatemala, were about 10 times 
more expensive than Chulha stoves, but typically achieved efficiencies that were somewhat 
higher—close to 30 per cent.

Top Runner Programme on end-use efficiency in Japan

Japan has maintained mandatory energy efficiency standards for appliances and automo-
biles since 1980, which were not very successful, however, as they were largely based on ne-
gotiations with industry. In 1998, Japan initiated the Top Runner Programme to improve 
energy efficiency of end-use products, as a cornerstone of its climate change policy. The idea 
is that the most energy-efficient product on the market during the standard-setting process 
establishes the “Top Runner standard” which all corresponding product manufacturers will 
aim to achieve in the next stage.9 Energy efficiency standards are discussed and determined 
by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry and its advisory committees comprising 
representatives  from  academia,  industry,  consumer  groups,  local  governments  and  mass 
media. The scope of the Programme is reviewed every two to three years. It started with 9 
products and had been expanded to 21 products by 2009 (Grübler and others, forthcom-
ing). The targeted products account for more than 70 per cent of residential electricity use. 
To date, all targets set by the programme have been achieved or overachieved. For example, 
the energy efficiency of room air conditioners improved by 68 per cent, of refrigerators by 
55 per cent, of TV receivers by 26 per cent, of computers by 99 per cent, of fluorescent 
lights by 78 per cent, of vending machines by 37 per cent and of gasoline passenger cars by 
23 per cent (Japan, Energy Conservation Center, 2008), representing enormous technical 
improvements and attaining one of the highest levels of energy efficiency in the world. Yet, 
it is not clear whether the Programme can be replicated successfully outside Japan. Specific 
success factors include a limited number of domestic producers with high technological 
capacity, which were willing to comply with the standards even without sanctions.

Car fuel efficiency standards in the United States

The typical efficiency of United States cars in the early 1970s had been the same as in the 
1930s—13 miles per gallon (mpg), which meant 85 per cent of the gasoline was wasted (Smil, 
2010a). The Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards, which were introduced in 
1975, doubled the average efficiency of United States passenger cars to 27.7 mpg by 1985, but 
no further improvements were made until CAFE standards were revised in 2007. In fact, the 
popularity of sport utility vehicles (SUV), vans and pickup trucks depressed United States 
vehicle fleet efficiency, which reached only 22 mpg by 2006. The 2007 revision of CAFE no 
longer exempts light trucks classified as SUVs or passenger vans (unless they exceed a 4.5 t 
gross vehicle weight rating), and the aim is to increase fleet efficiency to 35 mpg by 2020. For 
comparison, the 1913 Model T Ford, which was the world’s first mass-produced automobile, 
averaged 25 mpg. All new cars in New Zealand currently rate between 34 and 62 mpg. The 
EU corporate vehicle standard of 130 gCO2/km, to be achieved by 2012, is equivalent to 47 
mpg (or 5 litres (l)/100 km) for a gasoline-fuelled car.

Lessons from market-based measures

Oil price spikes, high gasoline taxes, subsidies and permit trading schemes are “natural” 
experiments which provide insights into the impact of market measures, such as energy 
or carbon taxes.

The volatility of emissions 
trading schemes holds back 
investment in low-carbon 
infrastructure

Carbon price signals and emissions trading

The social cost of carbon (SCC) corresponds to the externality of a unit of carbon emitted 
over its lifetime in the atmosphere. Under an optimal climate policy, the emission reduc-
tion target should be set so that the cost of reducing emissions (marginal abatement cost) 
is equal to the SCC. SCC estimates vary. For instance, estimates previously used by the 
Government of the United Kingdom for policy and project evaluation ranged from $41 to 
$124 per ton of CO2, with a central case of $83. Estimates from other models, for example, 
the Dynamic Integrated model of Climate and the Economy (DICE), are substantially 
lower.  Recently,  the  market  price  of  allowances  in  the  EU  Emissions  Trading  Scheme 
(ETS) has fluctuated around $20 per ton of CO2. With respect to individual behaviour, 
calculations done by MacKay (2008) suggest that only with very high carbon prices would 
there be a noticeable impact on activities like driving and flying. For instance, he concluded 
that at $150 per ton, domestic users of gas would notice the cost of carbon in their heating 
bills; a price of $250 per ton would increase the effective cost of a barrel of oil by $100; at 
$370, carbon pollution would cost enough to significantly reduce people’s inclination to 
fly; and at $900, driving habits might be significantly changed. The prevailing allowance 
prices appear too low to foster “market pull” of low-carbon technologies, and the volatility 
of emissions trading schemes holds back investment in low-carbon infrastructure.

Emissions trading markets require careful design and a sophisticated regula-
tory framework which explicitly takes into account strategic gaming behaviour of actors. 
For example, in the case of emissions trading in Germany, the design of the first National 
Allocation  Plan  (NAP  I,  2005-2007)  led  to  “windfall”  profits  for  high  emitters  and 
further increased an already existing preference for investments in coal compared with 
natural gas (Pahle, Fan and Schill, 2011). In contrast, alternative allocation rules, such as 
full auctioning of permits or a single best available technology benchmark, would have 
substantially increased natural gas investment incentives. A total of 10 coal power plants 
(11.3 GW) are currently under construction in Germany, and plans for an additional 12 
coal power plants exist, which together would account for about 32 per cent of German 
peak electricity demand in 2008 (Bundesnetzagentur, 2009). In other words, the details of 
institutional design are at least as important as the overall choice of policy instrument.

Gasoline taxes

In  November  2010,  gasoline  retail  prices  in  different  countries  ranged  from  about  2.2 
cents to 256 cents per litre, the wide range being due to massive government interven-
tion in the form of gasoline subsidies and taxes (Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale 
Zusammenarbeit, 2011). This wide range is not limited to gasoline retail prices, but is 
typical of most energy markets. Fifteen countries (mainly oil producers) had “very high 
subsidies”, with retail prices ranging from 1 to 51 cents per litre, which was below the 
world crude oil price of $81 per barrel at the time. Eight countries (mostly very poor) had 
retail prices ranging from $0.52 to $0.76 per litre, the latter being the prevailing level 
in the United States at the time. The majority of developing countries had retail prices 
ranging from $0.77 to $1.46 per litre, the latter being at the level of the lowest price level 
in EU (which was that of Romania). A mixed group of countries, including almost all EU 
members, Japan, high-income oil producers (Norway and the United Kingdom) and a few 
least developed countries (Senegal and Malawi) had retail prices ranging from $1.46 to 
$2.54 per litre. High gasoline prices have not halted the growth of vehicle miles in affluent

countries, but they have created a preference for smaller and more fuel-efficient vehicles. 
Nonetheless,  absent  regulations,  income  has  been  the  main  driver  of  transport  energy 
demand, regardless of the level of gasoline retail prices.

These cases illustrate the limitations of a policy approach based on price incen-
tives. In the context of the debate about a global CO2 tax, it is useful to note that gasoline 
taxes were equivalent to carbon taxes of $248 per tCO2 in China, $451 in Japan, $575 in 
Germany, $753 in the Netherlands and $832 in Turkey, whereas subsidies for gasoline 
in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela were equivalent to a carbon rebate of $202 per 
tCO2.10 The implied carbon taxes are between 10 and 100 times higher than the prevail-
ing carbon prices under the Clean Development Mechanism or in EU-ETS markets. They 
are also higher than carbon taxes deemed necessary for the energy sector as a whole with 
respect to the declared 450 ppmv stabilization, according to most mitigation scenarios 
(see, for example, Global Energy Assessment, forthcoming; and Intergovernmental Panel 
on Climate Change, 2001). Yet, only regulatory measures (such as those of the Top Runner 
Programme in Japan) have had significant impacts on fuel efficiency and emissions of road 
vehicles.

Feed-in tariffs

Feed-in tariffs (FITs) guarantee suppliers of renewable electricity a price that covers their 
costs with a profit, even though the price is higher than that paid for the fossil fuel-based 
alternative. The FIT consists in either fixed prices based on generation cost, independent of 
the market (as in Germany), or a fixed premium on top of the market price for electricity 
(as in Spain). FIT policies have been adopted in some 75 national and subnational (State/
provincial) jurisdictions worldwide (REN21, 2010). A study of support policies for elec-
tricity from renewable sources in OECD and selected developing countries concludes that 
jurisdictions with FITs had the highest market growth for renewables and that payments 
per kWh tend to be lower under FITs than under standard renewable portfolio schemes 
(International Energy Agency, 2008a). However, as with any subsidy instrument, careful 
design  and  periodic  re-calibration  are  necessary  to  ensure  that  objectives  are  achieved 
at the lowest cost to society, and this requires strong government capacity. Regulatory 
capture, where entrenched industry interests are able to extract subsidies even after the 
legislative objective has been attained, is common.

Does every little bit help: a critical  
assessment of current approaches

The previous section painted a picture of massive Government intervention and private 
sector responses to the need to promote clean energy technology research, development 
and deployment in response to the oil crises and the climate change challenge. Yet, energy 
technology change has slowed considerably at the level of the global fuel mix since the 
1970s, and there is no evidence to support the popular notion of an acceleration of energy 
technology change, either at the fuel or at the sector, plant or unit levels. In order to recon-
cile these facts, a science-based reality check is needed, in order to assess the implications 
of current plans and practices.

Plans need to add up globally

Planetary-scale 
transformations are 
required to meet  
emissions targets

At the most basic level, initiatives need to add up (in arithmetic terms) to the declared 
ambitions at the national and global levels. Despite impressive growth rates for the dif-
fusion of renewable energy technologies since 2000, it is clear that the current trajectory 
is nowhere near attaining a realistic path towards complete decarbonization of the global 
energy system by 2050. Similarly, the renascence of nuclear power has barely made up for 
losses of older capacities that are increasingly being phased out.

By making simple order-of-magnitude assessments, MacKay (2008) and Smil 
(2010a)  illustrate  the  infeasibility  of  prominent  existing  plans  and  proposals.  MacKay 
(2008)  also  traces  that  contours  of  low-carbon  energy  plans  for  the  world,  the  United 
States, the United Kingdom and the rest of Europe: the plans add up in terms of global 
emissions targets, but to achieve these targets, planetary-scale transformations are required. 
And MacKay shows that existing energy plans do not add up to such a transformation. All 
actions help but, if small, they help only a little. For example, systematically switching off a 
phone charger saves about as much energy as is used up in three seconds of driving a car.

At the international level, global environmental problems and especially global 
warming are often thought of as problems of developed countries, but in fact populous 
emerging  developing  economies  increasingly  dominate  growth  in  global  emissions  and 
resource use. Without participation and actions by today’s developing countries, no real-
istic solution is possible to any one of the global environmental problems. For example, 
the  majority  of  today’s  energy-related  investments  are  in  developing  countries.  During 
2010-2050, the cumulative cost of the energy system (including investment and operating 
costs) is estimated at about $60 trillion in developed countries and about $80 trillion in 
developing countries (Global Energy Assessment, forthcoming).

The net result of a 
successful national climate 
policy could be an overall 
increase in emissions 
worldwide if production 
plants are simply 
transferred abroad

Plans also need to add up at the system level

Plans also need to add up in terms of both the requirements of the energy system and 
the overall progress measures such as global eco-efficiency, because energy technologies 
are  part  of  a  complex  interdependent  system  and  because  measures  devised  to  achieve 
eco-efficiency at the local or even at national levels do not necessarily add up to a globally 
eco-efficient system.

First, plans need to add up in terms of the global energy-economy-environment 
(E3) system. For example, satisfying about 20 per cent of today’s demand for gasoline, 
diesel and kerosene with modern biofuels is possible in technical and economic terms from 
the perspective of the energy system alone. However, this would likely have enormous im-
pacts on agriculture, food prices, ecosystems, water availability, the nitrogen cycle, energy 
demand and prices and, most importantly, the livelihoods of the poor in rural and urban 
areas alike (see also chap. III). Thus, a 20 per cent share might not be enough. With respect 
to the United Kingdom’s climate policy, its implementation has led to decreasing green-
house gas emissions and the country’s early achievement of its commitments under the 
Kyoto Protocol; but while this achievement is commendable, what needs to be ascertained 
is whether lower emissions are indeed the result of fundamental changes in technologies 
or consumption patterns. In fact, when greenhouse gas emissions that are embodied in 
products that had been imported to the United Kingdom are included, the overall green-
house gas emissions associated with energy and product demand in the United Kingdom 

The clean energy technological transformation

51

increased by 12 per cent between 1992 and 2004 (Minx and others, 2009). In other words, 
greenhouse gas pollution was exported abroad. In addition, it is highly likely that such 
production, most of which was moved to emerging economies, is carried out with lower 
energy efficiency and higher emission intensities. Thus, the net result of the commendable 
United Kingdom climate policy was quite possibly an overall increase in greenhouse gas 
emissions  worldwide—the  opposite  of  the  objective  intended.  This  example  highlights 
the importance of global coordination and the need for reality checks of measures from a 
systems and global perspective.

Second, plans also need to add up in terms of the national E3 system. One 
phenomenon to consider in this regard is the “rebound effect” (the Jevons paradox), that 
is, the increased energy use resulting from increased energy efficiency. While the rebound 
effect may be small at the local level, it is typically large at the level of the national or of 
the global economy. Thus, an increase in energy efficiency of a manufacturing plant, while 
highly desirable from an eco-efficiency perspective at the corporate level, may be partially or 
wholly offset through reduced energy prices and increased real incomes. Additional meas-
ures and regulations are needed to prevent or at least limit the rebound effect.

At the same time, incentives to increase energy efficiencies are large, especially 
in  end-use.  For  example,  the  typical  compounded  efficiency  of  the  energy  chain  from 
crude oil at the well to useful transport services is about 2 per cent only (assuming single 
occupancy of a passenger car with five seats). While in this case, the efficiency of trans-
forming primary to final energy is as high as 93 per cent (including transport, refining 
and distribution), the efficiency of transforming final to useful energy efficiency is only 
about 10 per cent (that is, the result of 20 per cent engine efficiency and 50 per cent ef-
ficiency of drivetrain and car). Full occupancy of the car would increase the compounded 
efficiency  from  2  to  10  per  cent.  In  contrast,  no  conceivable  future  engine  technology 
could achieve the same overall efficiency increase for a single occupancy vehicle. Engine 
efficiency  would  need  to  be  100  per  cent,  which  is  a  thermodynamic  impossibility.  It 
should also be noted that there is only limited potential for efficiency improvements in 
power  supply  technologies,  some  of  which,  such  as  gas  combined  cycle  and  integrated 
gasification combined cycle (IGCC) plants, operate not far from their theoretical limits. 
Similarly, the so-called cumulative degree of perfection is high for diesel oil and natural 
gas,  compared  with  other  materials,  implying  only  modest  room  for  improvements  in 
this area (Szargut, 1988). In contrast, there is still a relatively large potential for efficiency 
increases in end-use appliances.

Third, plans need to add up at the level of the energy systems themselves. For 
example, at present, there are no good substitutes for fossil fuels as industrial feedstocks. 
Coke  made  from  coal  is  needed  as  a  reduction  agent  for  smelting  iron  from  ore.  The 
historical alternative of charcoal cannot be used in modern blast furnaces, and even if it 
could be used in some form, about 3.5 Gt of dry wood per year would be needed for pig 
iron smelting alone, which requires plantations that are about two thirds the size of the 
forests of Brazil. Similarly, there are no plant-based substitutes for hydrocarbon feedstocks 
(about 100 giga cubic metres (Gm3) of natural gas per year) used in making plastics and 
synthesizing  ammonia  for  fertilizer  production.  As  a  result,  any  proposal  to  phase  out 
fossil fuels requires targeted research into alternative industrial processes.

Fourth, plans need to add up at the level of power systems. For example, owing 
to its intermittency and need for backup capacity, the potential reduction in greenhouse 
gas emissions that can be achieved by wind power depends almost entirely upon the exist-
ing power system to which it is added. In fact, the installation of a wind farm does not

necessarily lead to a reduction in emissions, in particular when backup capacity is provided 
by coal power. The “performance credit” of wind power in Germany was estimated to have 
been about 10 per cent in 2010 and is expected to fall to 3 per cent in 2030, with increas-
ing installed wind power capacity (assuming a target of 99 per cent power grid reliability) 
(Deutsche Physikalischen Gesellschaft, 2010). This means that for each GW of newly in-
stalled wind power capacity, an additional 0.9 GW backup power capacity (for example, 
coal, gas or nuclear) is needed to ensure grid reliability, owing to wind’s intermittency. 
Thus, expansion of wind power in Germany (and many other countries) primarily reduces 
fossil fuel demand, but hardly substitutes fossil-fired power plant capacities in the European 
grid, which explains the high systemic estimates of CO2 mitigation costs for wind power of 
€40-€80 per tCO2, compared with lower estimates based on assuming a full substitution of 
fossil-fuelled power capacities (Deutsche Energie-Agentur (DENA), 2005).

Ambitious plans for deployment of intermittent renewables need to be based 
on plans for the development of smart grids. The Global Energy Assessment (forthcom-
ing)  has  estimated  that  the  required  share  of  zero  carbon  energy  in  2030  would  need 
to be about 22 per cent, in order for the target of staying below a 2° C increase from 
pre-industrial levels to be achieved with a probability of at least 50 per cent. Only the 
most ambitious technology-optimistic scenarios achieve such a high share, as illustrated 
by  a  literature  review  of  renewable  energy  scenarios  (Hamrin,  Hummel  and  Canapa, 
2007). The most technology-optimistic of the IEA scenarios (IEA ETP tech plus) barely 
reaches  this  level;  the  others  include  the  EU  World  Energy  Technology  Outlook-2050 
(WETO-H2) scenario with CO2 constraint, and the Greenpeace “revolution” scenario. 
Assumptions in these scenarios are heroic indeed, requiring unprecedented technological 
progress, international cooperation and transfers. The same review also shows that under 
these and even less ambitious renewable energy scenarios, it is expected that a global share 
of more than 5 per cent of intermittent modern renewable power will be reached by 2020. 
This will require some sort of smart grid to deal with load balancing, which in turn means 
that these scenario plans assume the rebuilding of the existing power grids in most large 
economies within the next 10 years, an extraordinarily ambitious undertaking (compara-
ble undertakings in previous energy transitions took more than 50 years).

The  International  Energy  Agency  (2010b)  has  presented  a  “New  Policies 
Scenario”, which assumes implementation of recently announced commitments and plans, 
including those that are being discussed but have not yet been adopted. In this scenario, 
demand for all types of energy increases in non-OECD countries, while in OECD, de-
mand for coal and oil declines. Globally, most new primary energy demand will be for 
fossil fuels until 2035, even in this very ambitious and optimistic scenario (figure II.7), 
which means that, ss a result, fossil fuels would maintain their central role in the primary 
energy mix, with their share declining from 81 per cent in 2008 to 74 per cent in 2035. 
Global emissions would continue to rise, but at a decreasing pace, reaching 35 Gt in 2035 
(which is 21 per cent higher than the 2008 level). Developing countries would account 
for essentially all the increase, whereas developed countries’ emissions would peak before 
2015 and then fall. This would lead to stabilizing GHG (equivalent) concentrations at 
over 650 ppmv, resulting in a likely temperature rise of more than 3.5° C in the long term. 
In other words, national plans announced across the world plus what was agreed at the 
Cancun session of the Conference of the Parties in 2010 do not add up to action sufficient 
to achieve the global targets for emission reductions.

Feasible timescales for transitions

The comprehensive account given by Smil (2010b) of energy transitions suggests that the 
scale of the envisaged global transition to non-fossil fuels is about 20 times larger than the 
scale of the historical transition (fossil fuel use was about 425 EJ in 2010, compared with 
20 EJ for traditional biomass in 1890). The physical magnitude of today’s energy system 
based on fossil fuels is enormous, indeed. There are thousands of large coal mines and 
coal power plants, about 50,000 oilfields, a worldwide network of at least 300,000 km 
of oil and 500,000 km of natural gas pipelines, and 300,000 km of transmission lines. 
Globally, the replacement cost of the existing fossil fuel and nuclear power infrastructure 
is at least $15 trillion-$20 trillion. China alone added more than 300 GW of coal power 
capacity from 2000 to 2008, an investment of more than $300 billion, which will pay 
for itself only by 2030-2040 and will run maybe until 2050-2060. In fact, most energy 
infrastructures have recently been deployed in emerging economies and are completely 
new, with typical lifetimes of at least 40-60 years. Clearly, it is unlikely that the world 
will decide overnight to write off $15 trillion-$20 trillion in infrastructure and replace 
it with a renewable energy system having an even higher price tag. At the same time, it 
should be noted that the long-term incentive to change the existing energy system should 
be powerful, too, particularly in view of the fact that oil importers spent about $2 trillion 
to buy crude oil in 2007.

Globally, modern renewables (wind, geothermal, solar photovoltaic, solar ther-
mal and modern biofuels) accounted for 0.45 per cent of primary energy in 1990 and 0.75 
per cent in 2008, which in relative terms corresponds to an average growth of 2.9 per cent 
per year. Over the same period, this was faster than the average annual growth of coal 
(1.6 per cent), crude oil (1.5 per cent) and natural gas (1.2 per cent). In absolute amounts, 

The growth of modern 
renewables from 1990 to 
2008 was much slower than 
historical expansions of oil-
based energy at 8 per cent 
per year from 1880 to 1900

54

World Economic and Social Survey 2011

however, this growth amounted to the addition of 50 Mtoe of modern renewables, com-
pared with much larger additions of coal (760 Mtoe), of oil (1,080 Mtoe) and of natural 
gas production (990 Mtoe). The growth of modern renewables from 1990 to 2008 was 
much slower than historical expansions of coal, at 5 per cent per year from 1850 to 1870; 
oil extraction, at 8 per cent per year from 1880 to 1900; and natural gas production, at 8 
per cent per year from 1920 to 1940. Modern renewables (half of which was wind power) 
accounted for 3 per cent of global electricity production in 2008.

Meanwhile, internal combustion and diesel engines, which were first deployed 
in the late nineteenth century, still power about 1 billion cars, trucks, trains, ships and 
heavy machinery, with a combined capacity of about 150 terawatts (TW) (corresponding 
to 10 times the world’s energy demand) (Smil, 2010b). Solutions that do not build on the 
prevailing prime movers and existing energy infrastructure will require decades to make 
significant dents in the primary energy mix. Unprecedented and worldwide coordinated 
measures are needed to transform the global energy system into an almost carbon-free one 
by 2050.

Completion of some national energy transitions has been achieved more rap-
idly. For example, following the discovery of the giant Groningen natural gas field in the 
Netherlands, the natural gas share went from 1 per cent in 1958 to 5 per cent in 1965 and 
to 50 per cent in 1971. Portugal increased its share of renewables, including hydro, from 
17 to 45 per cent in a matter of five years, from 2005 to 2010, and plans to become the 
first country to inaugurate a national network of charging stations for electric cars in 2011. 
However, it needs to be emphasized that small, resource-rich or affluent countries can 
achieve much faster transitions than large, resource-poor, or low-income countries.

One way to speed up the deployment of modern renewables is to rebuild the 
national grids so as to make them smart as well as to strengthen cross-border power inter-
connections. Current ambitions would require a rebuilding of the majority of the power 
grids in the world within the next 10 years, another achievement that would be completely 
unprecedented, which is not to say that it would be technically impossible, but only that 
it would come at a significant social and economic cost and would divert resources from 
other pressing needs, especially those of the world’s poor.

Staying within limits

Energy plans must take account of certain types of limits:

•	

•	
•	
•	

: what is affordable?

: what is doable technically?

: what is acceptable socially and politically?

: what is possible within planetary limits and according to the 

Biophysical limits
laws of nature?
Scientific-technical limits
Economic limits
Socio-political limits
When proponents and adversaries of energy technologies make opposing state-
ments about their potential, the differences are often a reflection of the different types of 
limits that are being considered (MacKay, 2008). For example, a solar power proponent 
might state that the potential for solar radiation absorbed by land is 790 zettajoules (ZJ), 
which was about 2,000 times the figure for fossil fuel extraction in 2010. Smil (2010b, 
p. 110) notes that “direct solar radiation is the only form of renewable energy whose total 
terrestrial flux far surpasses not only today’s demand for fossil fuels but also any level of 
global energy demand realistically imaginable in the twenty-first century”. However, this

is what is biophysically available—not what it is technically possible to harness. Leaving 
aside  unsuitable  locations  constituting  about  half  of  the  world’s  land  area  (those  char-
acterized by weak insolation or inaccessibility) about 470 ZJ are available. Yet, it would 
be technically possible to harness only a small fraction of this, and even less would be 
economically or politically acceptable. For example, the very ambitious Global Energy 
Assessment efficiency scenarios assume a techno-economic potential for solar PV, solar 
thermal and solar water heating of 2.6 ZJ.

MacKay (2008) provides per capita estimates of technical potentials for har-
nessing renewable energies for Europe, the United Kingdom, the United States and the 
world. Even leaving aside any economic and socio-political limits, he provides a low-car-
bon energy plan for the world and estimates the global potential for non-solar renewable 
energy to be about 83 GJ per capita (table II.3). In other words, without tapping at least 
some form of solar energy, it is technically impossible to provide for the level of energy use 
prevailing in Western Europe today. One billion people in Europe and North Africa could

be sustained by country-size solar power facilities in deserts near the Mediterranean; and 
half a billion in North America could be sustained by Arizona-size facilities in the deserts 
of the United States and Mexico.

The impacts of such a global energy plan on socio-economic and ecological 
systems would be enormous. For example, the harnessing of 284 EJ of biofuels would 
require using all of the world’s arable or cropland of about 27 million km2 for biofuels, 
which is clearly infeasible. For comparison, the land requirements of today’s global fossil 
fuel infrastructure are less than 30,000 km2, which is about the size of Belgium (Smil, 
2010b).  MacKay’s  order-of-magnitude  estimates  provide  an  illustration  of  the  existing 
technical limits and what, in principle, could technically be achieved with extraordinary 
political and financial commitments.

Technical limits of renewables are essentially based on spatial power densities of 
the technologies, their conversion efficiencies and their deployment potential. Solar power 
reaches spatial power densities that are two orders of magnitude higher than for wind and 
three orders of magnitude higher than for photosynthesis. Solar power can in principle 
reach power densities commensurate with demand densities in houses and some smaller 
cities. However, industry, high-rise buildings and megacities (in which the majority of the 
world’s population will live) require even higher power densities than solar could offer. 
These were made available by fossil fuels and nuclear power which exhibit power densities 
that are higher than the demand of even high-rise buildings (Smil, 2010a). In contrast, 
wind power or biomass, with power densities less than 0.5 W/m2, require very large areas 
of  land  and  power  infrastructure  to  provide  power  to  urban  areas.  In  fact,  the  energy 
demand footprint for England and large parts of Central Europe is larger than what it 
would be possible to provide with non-solar renewables (MacKay, 2008).

Economic limits and affordability receive the most attention in the global debate 
on the potential for low-carbon energy technologies. While it is correct that, aside from 
hydro (the potential of which is low but of high quality) and wind (which provides low-
quality power), modern renewables continue to be significantly more expensive, economic 
limits are ultimately a lesser constraint, as they can be overcome with political will and 
special efforts.

Socio-political limits are difficult to overcome. In fact, most energy technology 
debates completely disregard associated socio-political limits. In pluralistic democracies, 
the “not-in-my-backyard” (NIMBY) attitude is a powerful factor. There are civil move-
ments against pipelines, coal power plants, wind and solar power plants and, especially, 
nuclear power installation. Italy has phased out nuclear power and Germany, Sweden and 
Belgium took phase-out decisions at some point in time. An extreme example involves 
the licensing of the Konrad radioactive waste depository in Germany which took 25 years 
and included public consultations with almost 289,387 people who formally raised more 
than 1,000 issues. Similar NIMBY movements exist against power transmission lines and 
pipelines. In Germany, there is already a NIMBY movement against CCS long before its 
commercialization  (Roehrl  and  Toth,  2009).  In  poorer  countries,  higher  energy  prices 
typically mean higher food prices and potentially lead to increased poverty, social conflict 
and even revolts.

The NEEDS project of EU quantified the full (direct and indirect) costs for en-
ergy technologies used in European countries. In addition, a multi-criteria decision analysis 
(MCDA) process was organized with decision makers who were given the full information/
data on externalities. Decision makers’ preference ratings of energy technologies differed 
greatly from both the direct and the full costs, reflecting different socio-political preferences 

The clean energy technological transformation

The problem of energy 
access is one mainly of 
distribution, not of absolute 
amounts of available 
resources

If all energy conversion 
devices operated at their 
theoretical maximum 
efficiency, global energy 
demand could be reduced 
to one ninth of  
current levels

(Hirschberg and others, 2009). Such differences are a robust finding across MCDA carried 
out among utilities and policymakers, both in Europe and in China (Hirschberg and others, 
2006; 2009). Such results do not bode well for full-cost pricing solutions to clean energy, 
because the binding constraint will be socio-political rather than techno-economic.

The proposal by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), but 
also voiced among the G20, to phase out fossil fuel subsidies offers another example of the 
importance of socio-political limits. In 2009, most of global fossil fuel consumption subsi-
dies amounting to $312 billion were in developing countries. Of this amount, oil products 
received $126 billion, natural gas $85 billion, fossil-fired electricity $95 billion and coal 
$6  billion.  Fossil  fuel  consumption  subsidies  in  countries  with  low  levels  of  access  to 
modern energy11 amounted to $71 billion, and subsidies in these countries for residential 
use of kerosene, electricity and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) (sometimes labelled “fuels 
for the poor”) were less than $50 billion (International Energy Agency, 2010b). Thus, the 
problem of energy access is one mainly of distribution, not of absolute amounts of available 
resources. IEA estimates that universal access to modern energy services could be achieved 
by redistributing just 12 per cent of fossil fuel consumption subsidies in developing coun-
tries so as to deal with this problem in the poorest developing countries.

Limits to improving energy efficiency

As discussed above, energy-efficiency improvements when combined with limits on en-
ergy consumption have great potential to help achieve global targets. However, it is clear 
that there are a number of barriers to deployment and adoption of more efficient energy 
converters, as well as techno-economic limits to be considered. Solutions to overcoming 
the known barriers exist, but they require long-term commitment and a stable systemic 
approach by decision makers.

Technical limits to energy efficiency improvements must be taken into account. 
In 2005, the overall efficiency of global energy conversion (from primary energy to services) 
was about 11 per cent (Cullen and Allwood, 2010a). In other words, global primary energy 
demand could be reduced to only one ninth, while the same energy services were provided, 
if all energy conversion devices were operated at their theoretical maximum efficiency. In 
more practical terms, but still assuming an almost perfect world, global primary energy 
demand could be reduced by 73 per cent (or to less than one fourth), while the current 
level of energy services were provided, mainly through a shift to passive systems (Cullen, 
Allwood and Borgstein, 2011). This is in line with the popularized overall “factor 4” and 
“factor 5” improvements (von Weizsäcker, Lovins and Lovins, 1998).

In 2005, primary-to-final exergy conversion efficiency was as high as 67 per 
cent (fuel losses, generation and distribution losses) but final-to-useful exergy conversion 
efficiency was only about 25 per cent (from conversion loss). Thus, 509 EJ primary exergy 
provided only about 86 EJ of useful exergy (in the form of motion, heat, cool/light/sound 
and other non-energy forms), while 128 EJ were lost in combustion, 173 EJ in heat transfer 
and 123 EJ through electric resistance, friction, fission and other fuel-related phenomena. 
In addition, a system loss is incurred in converting useful energy into final services (“serv-
ice efficiency”).12

Global energy-related services provided included passenger transport, freight transport, structure, 
thermal  comfort,  sustenance,  hygiene,  communication  and  illumination  (Cullen  and  Allwood,

It is through efficiency 
improvements in electric 
heaters, diesel engines, 
electric motors, biomass 
burners, gas burners and 
factory equipment that the 
highest potential savings 
would be achieved

It is important to consider the compounding of energy efficiencies across the 
chain. For example, if the conversion loss of each device in the chain had been reduced 
by only 1 per cent (and commensurate limits applied so as to avoid invoking the Jevons 
paradox), about 33 EJ, or 7 per cent of world primary energy of 475 EJ, could have been 
saved—an amount almost equal to the energy demand of China at the time. In this ex-
ample, upstream (fuel transformation and electricity generation) efficiency gains would 
save only 5 EJ, whereas downstream (end-use conversion devices) efficiency gains would 
be much larger, at savings of 28 EJ (Cullen and Allwood, 2010b).

Cullen and Allwood (2010b) estimated and ranked the cumulative global con-
version losses of end-use devices along their energy chain, relative to their theoretical ideal 
(table II.4). The table shows the highest potential savings that would be achieved through 
efficiency improvements of electric heaters, diesel engines, electric motors, biomass burn-
ers, gas burners and Otto engines. The smallest absolute gains were possible with light 
devices, electronic devices and aircraft engines. In other words, current policies focusing 
on energy-efficiency improvements in light bulbs, standby losses and aircraft engines are 
expected to add up to little on the global level.

Policy options and recommendations

Energy technology innovation matters. It concerns everyone and is often highly politi-
cized. Energy technology policy needs to be comprehensive and supported by industrial 
policy, especially in the context of support at the market formation phase of technology 
life cycles (chap. V). Most importantly, global and national energy policy is also develop-
ment policy and thus must demonstrate special consideration of the poor. Governments 
need to devise institutional designs that ensure a science-based reality check of energy 
technology policies. A wide range of policy instruments are available, including economic 
instruments, regulatory measures and cooperation (table II.5). Optimal policy packages

depend  strongly  on  a  country’s  institutions,  development  stage,  resource  endowments 
and socio-political preferences, and will change over time. In-depth analysis needs to be 
included in the process of designing policy packages, while simplified prescriptions can 
be  counter-productive.  However,  insights  from  past  experience  suggest  broad  guiding 
principles and performance targets which should guide the analysis (Grübler and others, 
forthcoming; Wilson and Grübler, 2010).

The need for comprehensive,  
strategic and system approaches

Comprehensive, strategic and systems approaches are needed (see chap. V for further de-
tails). The choice of individual technology-related policy instruments needs to be tailored 
to technology and national and local circumstances. Ignoring the systemic characteristics 
of technological change often leads to a partial view and fragmented or even contradic-
tory policies. Simplistic approaches need to be avoided, as they are commonly based on

myths rather than factual evidence. The co-benefits of comprehensive approaches can be 
substantial. For example, the costs of halving premature deaths due to air pollution by 
2030 and of ensuring energy security could be reduced to one fourth, if these goals were 
pursued  jointly  with  ambitious  greenhouse  gas  reduction  measures.  Bringing  universal 
access to electricity and modern cooking fuels by 2030 would not be in conflict with the 
other objectives (Riahi and others, forthcoming).

Learn from but be aware of the inevitable  
discontinuities of the historical past

Policy-induced scaling up and deployment of new technologies without lengthy forma-
tive periods of experimentation and testing could lead to additional risks and might lock 
in  inferior  technologies  (Wilson,  forthcoming).  Historically,  performance  and  quality 
advantages of new energy technologies compared with the lower energy quality (intermit-
tency and low power density) of modern renewable energy technologies, led to their early 
adoption  among  price-insensitive  consumers.  Fossil  fuel  resource  constraints  together 
with externality pricing might make renewables more cost-competitive, but competing 
land use will be a constraint on the large-scale deployment of renewables. Also, overcom-
ing vested interests is essential, in view of the fact that, historically, it is political efforts 
and public infrastructure investment that have set innovator countries apart from lag-
gards (Moe, 2010).

Manage uncertainties with portfolio diversification,  
scenario analysis, and a balanced mix of technology- 
neutral and technology-banded approaches

Picking technological winners ex ante should be avoided, while developing broad technol-
ogy  portfolios  should  be  promoted.  Doing  this  will  provide  a  hedge  against  the  risks 
of inherently uncertain outcomes of technological innovation. Failures vastly outnumber 
successes in both the private and public sectors. Sufficient time and resources need to be 
committed for experimentation before scaling up, so as to prevent any premature locking 
in of suboptimal technologies and clusters (van den Bergh and others, 2007).

Technology portfolios should represent the whole energy system and consider 
all innovation stages, so as to keep options open, but should avoid large-scale transfer of 
technology risks to the public sector. It should also be noted that less capital-intensive, 
smaller-scale (for example, granular) technologies tend to be associated with lower overall 
risk. Scenario analysis can be used for risk hedging through identification of “robust” tech-
nology portfolios. In this context, a careful balancing of technology-neutral policies (for 
example, carbon taxes) and technology-banded ones (for example, feed-in tariffs), as well 
as short- and long-term policy targets, should be considered (Sandén and Azar, 2005).

Pursue policies that promote high-performance  
innovations in niche markets

Policies designed to create market niches based on superior-quality technologies should 
be prioritized in order to shield them from full commercial competition during the initial 
development stages when experience is gained (Schot and Geels, 2008). At present, there 
are only a few evident niches in which cost-insensitive end-users might be persuaded to pay 

Technology portfolios

for environmental public goods.13 Historical evidence supports the market niche approach 
and illustrates the practical problems associated with efforts to “buy down” the learning 
curve  in  order  to  reduce  unit  costs.  New  technologies  may  not  need  subsidies  if  they 
exhibit high performance despite much higher costs.

Pursue innovation policy that is stable,  
credible, aligned and well timed

Stable and consistent expectations about the direction and shape of the innovation system, 
in  contrast  with  existing  practices  which  are  mostly  characterized  by  stop-go  policies, 
are  necessary  if  innovation  actors  are  to  commit  resources  (Bosetti  and  Victor,  2011). 
Innovation  policies  need  to  be  aligned,  which  requires  coherent  support  throughout 
the technology life cycle, but misalignment appears to be the norm in most countries.14
Dynamic technology standards can be effective, as evidenced by the Japanese Top Runner 
Programme  for  energy-efficient  appliances.  It  is  important  to  choose  realistic  goals  for 
technology  programmes  and  to  manage  the  expectations  of  innovation  system  actors, 
since programmes have often been discredited in the past simply because they did not 
achieve their irrationally exuberant goals. Most importantly, policies should be avoided 
that compress the formative phase unduly and support premature scaling up, as does the 
current approach taken in promoting CCS, for instance.

Innovations in end-use technologies are important

Public innovation expenditures for highly energy efficient end-use technologies need to 
be increased. Support for such technologies in the past has proved both cost-effective and 
successful, thereby generating high social returns on investment (Fri, 2003). Much greater 
emphasis needs to be put globally on improving end-use energy efficiency, complemented 
by behavioural change and limits imposed on energy, land, water and materials use.

A global “Top Runner Programme”

A global programme that follows the rationale of Japan’s Top Runner Programme should 
be considered. Such a programme would promote cooperation among countries, commu-
nities and individuals so as to achieve lower primary energy use and lower greenhouse gas 
emissions. Those with the best performance in groups with similar characteristics would 
successively set the standard for the next phase which laggards will aim to achieve. For 
example, Japan might be the top runner that sets the standards and targets to be achieved 
by other technologically advanced economies in terms of end-use energy efficiency. Other 
examples might include business people responsible for highly energy-intensive patterns of 
consumption of transport services, or high-income house-owners.

Furthermore, the programme might also strive to achieve individual primary 
energy use and greenhouse gas emissions targets. Given the already indicated technologi-
cal limits to fast-tracking the sustainable energy transformation, per capita caps on energy 
use and emissions may be needed to ease the challenge. The above analysis suggested that 

13

14

Some  examples  are:  no  fuel  inputs  (solar  PV  in  remote  off-grid  applications),  quiet  operation 
(nuclear power in submarines) and storage capacity (fuel cells for grid backup).
For  example,  support  for  low-carbon  technologies  is  undermined  by  fossil  fuel  subsidies  and 
efficiency improvements in transport are swamped by higher demand.

62

a limit of 70 GJ per capita would seem a reasonable long-term target to be achieved by 
2050. This limit would be similar to the figure for the present per capita primary energy 
use in China and that for the world average (figure II.8). It should be noted, however, that 
the suggestion is for a limit on primary energy (not final energy), which is most relevant 
for the environmental impact. In fact, a reasonable primary energy use limit could provide 
powerful incentives to increase energy efficiency and could ensure the continued provision 
of more and better energy end-use services despite lower primary energy use.

In  environmentally  conscious  Western  European  societies,  such  as  that  of 
Denmark, primary energy use is at about 150 GJ per capita, which could be brought down 
to the 70 GJ target with increased energy efficiency combined with measures to minimize 
the rebound effect. This would be much more of a challenge for the United States, which 
currently uses 340 GJ per capita. Such a limit would still allow ample space for energy 
demand growth in poor countries, such as India, with a per capita use of only 15 GJ. The 
target of 70 GJ per capita primary energy use would ideally be applied as averages not to 
countries, but to individuals, in line with the principle of individual fairness. Energy use 
within countries is highly uneven, with the world’s richest 500 million people (7 per cent 
of the world population)—who live in both developed and developing countries—using 
more than half of all primary energy (Pacala, 2007). Burden-sharing among countries 
based on the principle of individual fairness would differ significantly from sharing based 
on countries’ averages, except for the poorest countries which would have almost no com-
mitment either way.

Higher energy efficiency and lower primary energy use would take much of the 
pressure imposed by the imperative of rapid decarbonization off highly energy-intensive 
economies. Indeed, this chapter has provided ample evidence for why it might prove im-
possible to achieve the desired pace of global energy transition towards low-carbon and 
renewable energy without limits on primary energy use. A recent study on how to achieve 
a 100 per cent renewable energy system in Denmark by 2050 concluded that such an 
envisioned outcome was realistically achievable only if primary energy use was halved to 
70 GJ per capita (Lund and Mathiesen, 2009).

Closely associated with the target of energy use per capita would be a cap on 
individual CO2 emissions of 3 tCO2 to be achieved by 2050.15 Such a limit would again 
be ideally based on individual fairness, rather than fairness across nations. From 2007 
to 2030, such limits would then touch only people with annual earnings of more than 
$40,000 per capita (in PPP terms). For comparison, in 2007, the figure for average energy-
related CO2 emissions per capita16 of the 60 poorest countries and areas was less than 
1 tCO2. It was 1.4 tCO2 in Viet Nam and India; 1.9 tCO2 in Brazil and Indonesia; 2.3 
tCO2 in Egypt; 3 tCO2 in Mauritius and French Polynesia; 5 tCO2 in Switzerland, Sweden 
and China; 6 tCO2 in France and Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of); 7.7 tCO2 in Iceland 
and Italy; 10 tCO2 in Germany, Japan, the Russian Federation and the Republic of Korea; 
19 tCO2 in the United States and Australia; 20 tCO2 in Brunei Darussalam; and as much 
as 55 tCO2 in Qatar (United States Department of Energy, Carbon Dioxide Information 
Analysis Center, 2011).

Among major global scenarios, the Global Energy Assessment mix scenario 
appears to be roughly in line with the focus and targets proposed here. The scenario fore-
sees cumulative global energy-related investments of $65 trillion between 2010 and 2050, 
or about $1.6 trillion per year. About $23 trillion of this amount would be needed for im-
proving efficiencies, $12 trillion for smart grids (transmission and distribution), $8 trillion 
for renewable electricity and a combined amount of $4 trillion for fossil-fired and nuclear 
power plants. An amount of $13 trillion would be needed for fossil fuel extraction and $2 
trillion for biomass-related technology deployment (Riahi and others, forthcoming).

“Reality checks” through independent  
centres for energy systems analysis

Conceptually,  policymakers  could  mandate  technology-neutral  performance  targets 
and avoid favouring any specific technologies. They would still become involved in all 
phases of the innovation cycle, in order to ensure coherence and continuity, but would 
focus resources on research, development and possibly demonstration. In practice, most 
countries are already engaging in picking winners, directly or indirectly. In late industrial-
izing countries which can draw on existing technologies, current information about these 
technologies  will  reduce  the  uncertainties  associated  with  investing  in  specific  sectors. 
This makes it particularly important that technologies-related information be accessible at 
reasonable cost to developing countries and not unduly restrained by private intellectual 

15

Pacala  (2007)  suggests  that  a “fair”  personal  CO2  emissions  limit  be  brought  down  to  3.6 tCO2
over the next 50 years, in order to reach stabilization of concentrations at 450 ppmv. However, 
considering  the  uncertainty  surrounding  climate  change  projections  and  applying  the 
precautionary principle, setting the target at 3 tCO2 per capita by 2050 would ensure a sufficiently 
high probability that the stabilization target could be achieved (Jonas and others, 2010).
All  emission  estimates  are  production-based.  Only  the  United  Kingdom  has  useful  numbers  of 
greenhouse gas emissions based on consumption. 

64

property or monopolistic practices. Even in advanced countries, the practice of picking 
winning technology is perceived to be unavoidable. The important questions would be 
who should do the picking—and how. In general, policymakers should focus, preferably, 
on setting broad political goals, rather than on detailed technology-specific issues. Strategic 
long-term planning is essential in order to coordinate actions by many different actors in 
different parts of the complex, interdependent energy system. Markets can help coordinate 
to some extent, but no market has ever been devised that could efficiently coordinate the 
evolution of the global energy system towards achievement of global policy objectives.

In  the  majority  of  developing  countries,  Governments  continue  directly  or 
indirectly  to  “run”  the  energy  system  (apart  from  some  regulated  independent  power 
production). Energy and economic planning units typically provide in-depth assessments 
of government plans and targets. While, in theory, energy plans would be based on their 
independent assessments, in practice, energy planning units are not always independent 
and assessments are either tweaked to support political decisions or sidelined.

In countries with liberalized energy markets, Governments have also picked 
winners directly (for example, through feed-in tariffs or renewable energy standards) or 
indirectly (for example, through institutional design). These countries typically abolished 
planning units a long time ago, with analysis being carried out by academic institutions 
and, more recently, by regulators. However, in-depth energy assessments undertaken by 
academics are not necessarily independent, since they are typically funded through ex-
trabudgetary resources provided by Governments, professional associations or lobbyists. 
Further, regulators are (typically) responsible only for subcomponents of the energy system 
(for example, electricity markets) and have strategic interests of their own.

Hence,  Governments,  regardless  of  the  level  of  market  liberalization  and 
development stage, might consider the creation of energy system analysis centres with full 
independence  from  politics  which  ensure  reality  checks  and  alignment  of  policies  and 
initiatives.  These  centres  would  also  promote  global  coherence  and  compatibility  with 
green growth and sustainable development aspirations, through participation in a global 
network. A global hierarchy of eco-efficiency targets might be a simple means of systema-
tizing coordination.

One size does not fit all

By their very nature, energy policy interventions will induce structural economic change. 
Energy policies also tend to have strong distributive effects, benefiting some industries 
and household groups more than others. The degree and nature of the required structural 
change related to a sustainable energy transformation will also vary from country to coun-
try. The distributive impacts will also differ accordingly.

The sustainable energy transition offers significant economic opportunities for 
both  developed  and  emerging  developing  countries,  but  poses  additional  development 
challenges for the poorer and more vulnerable countries, which would require enhanced 
support from the international community.

Table II.6 provides a highly stylized presentation of the potential impacts for 
groups of countries, classified for present purposes by income level and status as net fuel 
exporters or importers. Clearly, the global and national distributive effects will depend 
on  a  range  of  factors  such  as  the  degree  of  dependence  on  fossil  fuel  imports  and  ex-
ports, the expected economic growth impacts of local technology capacity development,

and opportunities for countries to attract manufacturing of new technologies in efforts 
to industrialize. Estimating the welfare and distributive effects of those challenges and 
opportunities  is  not  the  purpose  of  this  Survey.  Yet,  such  effects  will  need  to  be  fully 
considered when designing global and national policies.

The  fact  that  the  major  emerging  economies  have  large  markets  for  energy 
technologies provides an opportunity to develop local technology capacities and upgrade 
industrial capabilities, as is the case for China. Oil-rich countries with high insolation 
would also have a number of opportunities to diversify their industrial base and leverage 
the existing oil infrastructure (for example, through manufacturing and deployment of

solar reactors in desert areas near existing oil facilities, with the reactors transforming CO2 
and water into gasoline).

At present, those opportunities would be considerably greater in the case of 
innovation of new technologies, since the market and intellectual property position in 
mature technologies is dominated by firms in the developed world.

The  sustainable  energy  transition  poses  challenges  to  the  poorest  countries 
which face greater obstacles (including small market size) in developing local technology 
capacities. Industrialized economies would continue to face the challenges of deindustrial-
ization and offshoring, trends which are independent of the sustainable energy transitions, 
and their main opportunities will be in leveraging their highly developed research capaci-
ties so as to maintain technological leadership in technology-intensive market segments.

Summary
The recent food crises have revealed deep structural problems in the global food system and 
the  need  to  increase  resources  and  foster  innovation  in  agriculture  so  as  to  accelerate  food 
production. Food production will have to increase between 70 and 100 per cent by 2050 to feed 
a growing population. With current agricultural technology, practices and land-use patterns, this 
cannot be achieved without further contributing to greenhouse gas emissions, water pollution 
and land degradation. The consequent environmental damage will undermine food productivity 
growth.
Achieving  sustainable  food  security  would  provide  a  long-term  solution  to  the  challenge 
of  combating  hunger  and  malnutrition,  mitigating  food  price  volatility  and  protecting  the 
environment. It will require, however, a radical change in existing policies—a change that would 
result  in  a  strengthening  of  currently  fragmented  systems  of  innovation  and  an  increase  in 
resources for agricultural development and sustainable resource management.
The main challenge is to improve incentives so that they promote and lead to the development 
of sustainable agriculture by small farm holders. Evidence has shown that, for most crops, the 
optimal farm is small in scale and it is at this level that most gains in terms of both sustainable 
productivity increases and rural poverty reduction can be achieved.

The global food crisis

The increase in prices underlying the 2007-2008 food crisis and the new food price spikes 
in 2011 have exposed the presence of serious threats to the sustainability of the global 
food system and its capacity to provide adequate and affordable access to food. Meeting 
the challenge of expanding food production to feed the world population over the coming 
decades requires a major transformation in agriculture. The so-called green revolution of 
the 1960s and 1970s helped boost agricultural productivity worldwide, but did not conduce 
to a sustainable management of natural resources, nor to food security for many of the 
world’s poor. The world now needs a truly green revolution in agriculture—one conducive 
to the kind of technological innovation that aims to radically improve the productivity of 
small farm holdings through environmentally sustainable natural resource management 
embedded in broader developmental agricultural support measures.

The recent global food 
crises laid bare long-term 
threats to food security

68

World Economic and Social Survey 2011

Persistent food insecurity

Almost 1 billion people 
are undernourished 
worldwide…

… with two thirds living in 
seven countries

The dramatic food price increases in 2007–2008 and the ensuing economic crisis saw the 
global number of undernourished people surpass 1 billion in 2009, signalling a threat to 
world economic, social and political stability. Although the number and proportion of 
hungry people, particularly in Asia, declined in 2010, amid signs of economic recovery, 
those figures remain above pre-crisis levels, leaving 925 million people undernourished 
(Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 2010a) (figure III.1). 

The World Food Summit Plan of Action (Food and Agriculture Organization 
of the United Nations, 1996) considered food security as existing “when all people, at all 
times, have physical and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet 
their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life” (para. 1). Based 
on this definition, undernourishment is thus a key indicator of food insecurity. The over-
whelming majority (98 per cent) of the world’s undernourished people live in developing 
countries, with two thirds of them concentrated in seven nations (Bangladesh, China, 
the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia and Pakistan). Most 
hungry people (578 million) reside in Asia and the Pacific, although the highest share (30 
per cent, or 239 million people) are found in sub-Saharan Africa (figure III.2).

While  progress  varies  from  country  to  country,  developing  countries  as  a 
group have not moved closer to the food security targets established at the World Food 
Summit: the number of undernourished people increased by almost 10 per cent between  
1990–1992 and 2010.1

exists when caloric intake is

is the amount of energy 
needed for light activity and a 
minimum acceptable weight

by country and over time 
depending on the gender 
and age structure of the 
population.

Commitments  agreed  to  at  the  1996 World  Food  Summit  included  the  call  for  at  least  halving 
the  number  of  undernourished  people  in  the  world  by  the  year  2015  (Food  and  Agriculture 
Organization of the United Nations, 1996, para. 7).

The  22  countries  regarded  as  facing  a  “protracted  food  security  crisis”  are 
home to over 165 million undernourished people (about 20 per cent of the world’s total). 
The proportion of undernourished people ranges from under 15 per cent in Côte d’Ivoire 
to almost 70 per cent in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (Food and Agriculture 
Organization of the United Nations, 2010a).

Impact of the 2007-2008 world food price spike

World  food  prices  increased  dramatically  in  the  period  2007–2008.  Prices  for  corn, 
wheat and rice more than doubled between 2006 and 2008. While prices declined in late 
2008, food prices have since rebounded, attaining new record highs in February 2011 
(figure III.3). Despite conflicting evidence, it would appear that recent price rises have 
also been accompanied by higher volatility, which increases uncertainty, thereby hinder-
ing  investment  in  human  and  physical  capital,  technology  and  innovation  (Food  and 
Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 2009a) (figure III.4).

The severe impact of the 2007-2008 food crisis on living conditions was at-
tested by the riots that broke out in over 30 countries. Evidence shows that 41 countries 
lost between 3 and 10 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) to rising energy and 
commodity prices in 2007-2008 (World Bank, 2008a). Increasing food prices have had 
a particularly negative impact on the poor who spend 50-70 per cent of their income on 
food (von Braun, 2009). Higher food prices are estimated to have pushed a further 100 
million people into poverty in 2007-2008 and nearly 50 million in the latter half of 2010 
(World Bank, 2008b; 2011).

Following the 2007-2008 
food price crisis, the 
number of people living 
in poverty increased by an 
estimated 100 million

Towards a truly green revolution for food security

71

The nature of the impact of price rises depends on countries’ economic struc-
ture, sectoral linkages, trade position, poverty levels and diet diversification (Rapsomanikis, 
2009).  Although  higher  prices  provide  incentives  to  increase  production,  many  small 
farm holders are unable to respond owing to lack of access to finance, agricultural inputs, 
markets and technology (United Nations, 2008a). Nevertheless, in developing countries 
with a large share of net producing households, high food prices boost demand for rural 
labour and incomes (Chant, McDonald and Verschoor, 2008). While countries like India, 
China and Indonesia have limited the domestic impact of higher international food prices 
through export restrictions on rice and other crops (Timmer, 2009), evidence from the 
latest  price  spikes  (2010-2011)  points  to  greater  convergence  of  trends  in  national  and 
international  food  prices,  which  is  a  cause  for  concern,  given  the  recent  steep  upward 
trajectory of global prices (Ortiz, Chai and Cummins, 2011).

Causes of the food price crisis

The world food crisis was the result of overlapping demand and supply crises (in 2006-2008, 
for example, world grain production fell short of consumption (figure III.5)).

Demand-side causes

Over the past 20 years, continued global population growth, principally in developing 
countries (see figure O.1(a)), and rising incomes, particularly in South-East Asia, have not 
only raised food consumption, but also altered dietary patterns, as reflected in a greater 
demand  for  animal  protein  (and  hence  food  grains).  Meat  consumption  in  China  and 

Food prices have been pushed

populations, commodity

World Economic and Social Survey 2011

India rose by about 25 per cent and 140 per cent, respectively, in the last decade (HM 
Government, 2010).

The significant depreciation of the United States dollar in 2008, in which most 
food  commodity  prices  are  denominated,  also  contributed  to  higher  prices.  The  Food 
and  Agriculture  Organization  of  the  United  Nations  (FAO)  estimates  that  for  each  1 
per cent depreciation of the United States dollar, agricultural commodity prices increase 
by between 0.3 and 0.8 per cent (Sarris, 2009). In addition, attempts by Governments 
to insulate domestic markets  from escalating international food prices and  prospective 
shortages through trade protection measures further increased the level and volatility of 
global prices. The persistence of high and volatile food prices has also been attributed to 
a notable recent increase in financial speculation in commodity futures markets (Gilbert, 
2008; United Nations, 2011).

Supply-side causes

Competition for land, 
climatic conditions, biofuel 
policies, high energy prices 
and structural problems in 
agricultural production and 
investment were supply-
side factors

Land available for food cultivation has been shrinking owing to degradation and com-
petition  for  other  uses  such  as  urban  development  and  production  of  non-food  crops. 
Deforestation is mainly driven by competition for agricultural land, be it for subsistence 
farming in Africa or for establishment of large-scale cattle and soy plantations in Latin 
America (Stern, 2007). In addition, increased purchases of farmland by foreign investors 
has resulted in the favouring of exports over domestic food production. An estimated 56 
million  hectares  of  land  in  developing  countries  were  bought  by  foreigners  in  2009,  a 
10-fold rise from the previous decade, with two thirds of these sometimes controversial 
“land grabs” occurring in Africa (Deininger and others, 2010).

Adverse  weather  conditions  in  2005-2006,  including  drought  in  Australia, 
possibly related to climate change, resulted in poor harvests and exerted upward pressure 
on prices (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 2008). Similarly, 
harmful  climatic  phenomena  in  the  Russian  Federation  and  Ukraine,  particularly  the 
recent heatwaves, are thought to be the main drivers behind the most recent international 
price spikes (World Bank, 2011).

Perhaps the most important contributing factor to the 2008-2009 food crisis, 
albeit still subject to debate, is the diversion of food commodities to biofuel production 
(Mitchell, 2008; Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 2009a). In 
2007, three quarters of the annual increase in world maize use was absorbed by ethanol 
plants alone, accounting for 12 per cent of total maize production. In the United States, 
one third of the domestic use of corn supply was for ethanol production and the biodiesel 
sector accounted for about 60 per cent of the rapeseed oil output of the European Union 
(EU) (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 2009a). United States 
and EU biofuel production has been supported by State subsidies and tariffs, which cost 
developed countries $11 billion in 2007 (United Nations, 2008a). Studies that attempt 
to explain the impact of biofuel demand on world food prices exhibit marked differences 
in their findings, which suggest that demand could explain anywhere from 15 to 70 per 
cent of the 2007-2008 food price hike. Direct competition between food and fuel has 
led to calls for support for a new generation of biofuels that do not compete with food 
(Vos, 2009).

In 2007-2008, oil price rises positively impacted the level and volatility of food 
prices by raising fertilizer, freight and other food production costs, as well as by creating 
incentives for biofuel expansion (United Nations, 2008a).

Towards a truly green revolution for food security

73

A  number  of  structural  impediments  to  the  expansion  of  food  production 
have been identified, including declining agricultural investment, partly owing to lower 
public investments and earlier low food prices (United Nations, 2008a). The share of total 
overseas development assistance (ODA) allocated to agriculture fell from a peak of 18 per 
cent in 1978 to 4 per cent in 2009, with ODA earmarked for agriculture having decreased 
significantly in the 1990s (United Nations, 2008a) (see figure III.6). In this context, the 
International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank and other institutions have been 
criticized for providing foreign aid conditional on the implementation of policies (such 
as  abolishing  fertilizer  subsidies  and  favouring  cash  crops)  that  have  undermined  food 
self-sufficiency and raised imports (Stiglitz, 2002). At the same time, donor nations have 
continued to engage in provision of distortionary agricultural subsidies to producers and 
consumers (amounting to $376 billion of Organization for Economic Cooperation and 
Development (OECD) expenditure in 2008), undermining the ability of farmers in devel-
oping countries to compete (United Nations, 2010b).

The intertwined factors examined above contributed to the global food crisis. 
In this context, the fact that the number of undernourished people worldwide (1 billion) is 
matched by the number of those who are overfed and obese, and that hunger in the world 
has continued to increase in recent decades despite continuous agricultural productivity 
growth and, generally, low food prices, calls poignantly into question the effectiveness of 
the global food distribution system (Godfray and others, 2010a). Yet, between 75 and 90 
per cent of staple foods are produced and consumed locally, which suggests that the world 
faces the prospect of a proliferation of cases of localized chronic food insecurity (United 
Nations Conference on Trade and Development, 2010).

Policy responses to the food crisis

The food price surge induced prompt policy reactions at both national and international 
levels. For instance, at the G8 Summit in Hokkaido Toyako in 2008, donors pledged to 
provide $10 billion in ODA to fight hunger (Group of 8, 2008); and, at the G8 Summit 
in L’Aquila, Italy, in 2009, $20 billion over three years to address food insecurity in a 
sustainable manner (Group of 8, 2009).

At  the  national  level,  countries  responded  differently,  with  a  wide  range  of 
mainly short-term policy measures including import tariff reductions, price controls, ex-
port restrictions, stock reductions, food programmes, new biofuel policies, and commodity 
futures markets regulation (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development 
and Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 2010). A study evaluating 
such responses in 10 emerging economies revealed the importance of providing targeted 
safety nets for the poor as emergency responses to food shortfalls. While trade protec-
tion and building food inventories may enhance national food availability in the short 
run, such measures may at the same time prove to be costly in terms of expenditure and 
contribute to keeping food prices high by restricting food supply in international markets 
(Jones and Kwiecinski, 2010).

Unsustainable natural resource management as a 
threat to both food security and the environment

A range of fundamental natural resources (such as land, water, air and biodiversity) pro-
vide the indispensable base for the production of essential goods and services upon which 
human survival depends. During the past half-century, shrinkage in the availability of 
natural resources occurred more rapidly than in any comparable time in history, driven in 
great part by human intervention in the environment in the form of agricultural activities. 
Although vital to the production and supply of food, feed and fuel, these have had negative 
environmental and socio-economic consequences, such as land degradation, water pollu-
tion,  climate  change,  biodiversity  loss,  reduced  long-term  productive  capacity,  poverty, 
migration and ill health (International Assessment of Agricultural Knowledge, Science 
and Technology for Development, 2009).

Environmental impacts

… including severe 
depletion of natural 
resources

Almost half of the world’s 
surface has been degraded

Land degradation is among the world’s greatest environmental challenges, with the po-
tential to destabilize societies, endanger food security and increase poverty (Millennium 
Ecosystem Assessment, 2005). Defined as a long-term decline in ecosystem function and 
productivity,  land  degradation  is  driven  mainly  by  poor  land  and  water  management, 
including  over-cultivation,  overgrazing,  deforestation  and  inadequate  irrigation  (Berry, 
Olson and Campbell, 2003).

Land degradation is increasing, in severity and extent, in many parts of the 
world, with about 40 per cent of the world’s land surface degraded (25 per cent has been 
degraded over the past quarter-century alone) and with an estimated 1.5 billion people 
directly  dependent  on  agriculture  (Bai  and  others,  2008).  Figure  III.7  depicts  global 
change in land productivity (in terms of carbon dioxide (CO2) fixation) over the period

1981-2003.2 Degrading areas are mainly in: the part of Africa that is south of the Equator, 
in South-East Asia and southern China, in north-central Australia, in the pampas and in 
swathes of boreal forest in Siberia and North America (ibid.).

Land degradation has negative effects on climate, biodiversity, water ecosys-
tems, landscape and other ecosystem services (see table III.1). While agriculture contributes 
significantly to the problem of climate change, it is also vulnerable to its effects. Climate 
change  impacts  agriculture  in  many  ways,  with  changes  in  temperature,  precipitation 
and  climatic  variability  affecting  the  timing  and  length  of  growing  seasons  and  yields 
and thereby exacerbating land degradation and contributing to water scarcity (Agrawala 
and Fankhauser, eds., 2008; and table III.2). Notably, in this regard, with temperature 
rises, crop productivity is forecast to increase at mid-high latitudes and decrease at lower 

2

Land  degradation  is  measured  by  the  change  in  the  normalized  difference  vegetation  index 
(NDVI), scaled in terms of net primary productivity (NPP). NPP is the rate at which vegetation fixes 
CO2 from the atmosphere less losses through respiration; deviation from the norm is used as an 
indicator of land degradation or improvement. As a proxy, the remotely sensed NDVI, which has 
been shown to be related to biophysical variables that control vegetation productivity and land/
atmosphere fluxes, is also used to estimate vegetation change (Bai and others, 2008).

Agriculture is a cause as 
well as a casualty of climate 
change

latitudes (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2007a). For instance, it is esti-
mated that, in Southern Africa, yields could fall by up to 50 per cent between 2000 and 
2020 (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2007b); and that, by 2080, 600 mil-
lion additional people could be at risk of hunger as a direct consequence of climate change 
(United Nations Development Programme, 2007, overview, p. 9).

There are important feedback mechanisms, however, as agriculture activity 
and  land  degradation  generate  greenhouse  gas  (GHG)  emissions  and  thus  contribute 
to  climate  change.  They  also  impact  land-surface  albedo  so  as  to  engender  adverse 
weather  patterns  (University  of  East  Anglia,  Overseas  Development  Group,  2006). 
Notwithstanding significant uncertainty in estimates, agricultural activities account for 
about  30  per  cent  of  emissions  of  greenhouse  gases  (carbon  dioxide  (CO2),  methane 
(CH4)  and  nitrous  oxide  (N2O))  (Baumert,  Herzog  and  Pershing,  2005).  Agriculture 
is a significant emitter of CH4 (50 per cent of global emissions) and N2O (70 per cent) 
(Bhatia, Pathak and Aggarwal, 2004). Emissions from cattle and other livestock account 
for just over one quarter of CH4 emissions.

There is much interest in the climate change mitigation potential of the reverse 
of this process, carbon sequestration, in both vegetation (forests in particular) and soil. 
Table III.3 summarizes the contribution of agriculture to greenhouse gas emissions.

Access to sufficient and safe water is crucial for food production, poverty re-

led to serious depletion of surface-water resources (Smakhtin, Revenga and Döll, 2004). 
Agricultural irrigation accounts for some 70 per cent of all water withdrawals.

Deforestation is a major 
cause of biodiversity loss

Moreover,  it  appears  that  water  quality  has  been  degraded  partly  owing  to 
intensive agriculture, which has become the main source of water pollution in many devel-
oped and developing countries, rendering it unsustainable and a source of risks to human 
health  (Molden  and  de  Fraiture,  2004).  Intensive  livestock  production  is  probably  the 
largest sector-specific source of water pollution (Steinfeld and others, 2006). Excessive use 
of agrochemicals (pesticides and fertilizers) also contaminates waterways. The capacity of 
coastal and marine ecosystems to produce fish for human harvest is highly damaged by 
overfishing and loss of wetlands and other water habitats.

Biodiversity underpins agriculture and food security through the provision of 
the genetic material needed for crop and livestock breeding, and raw materials for indus-
try, and other ecosystem services (International Assessment of Agricultural Knowledge, 
Science and Technology for Development, 2009). The past century has seen the greatest 
loss of biodiversity through habitat destruction, primarily through the conversion of for-
ests for agriculture.

While the last quarter-century has witnessed an increase in forest area in in-
dustrialized countries, developing countries have experienced an average decline of about 
10 per cent (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 2007) (figure 
III.8). The problem of deforestation is particularly severe in the humid tropics (Moutinho 
and Schwartzman, eds., 2005). Africa and South America suffered the largest net loss of 
forests from 1990 to 2005, with Africa accounting for over half of recent global losses, 
even though the continent hosts just over 15 per cent of the world’s forests (University of 
East Anglia, Overseas Development Group, 2006). Habitat destruction and degradation

is the major global threat to birds and amphibians, affecting almost 90 per cent of threat-
ened species (IUCN, Species Survival Commission, 2004). This is particularly evident 
in the case of tropical forests, which cover less than 10 per cent of the earth’s land area, 
yet  harbour  50-90  per  cent  of  the  planet’s  terrestrial  species  (Millennium  Ecosystem 
Assessment, 2005).

The spread of industrial agriculture has also promoted the simplification of 
agro-ecosystems, with reductions in the number of and variety of species. Further, produc-
tion of monocultures increases environmental risks by reducing biodiversity, ecosystem 
functions and ecological resilience (International Assessment of Agricultural Knowledge, 
Science and Technology for Development, 2009). In addition, over-exploitation of marine 
resources is so severe that an estimated 20 per cent of freshwater fish species have become 
extinct (Wood, Sebastian and Scherr, 2000), while certain commercial fish and other ma-
rine species are threatened globally (International Assessment of Agricultural Knowledge, 
Science and Technology for Development, 2009).

Socio-economic impacts

Unsustainable  natural  resource  management  also  has  adverse  socio-economic  con-
sequences.  In  particular,  land  degradation  can  lead  to  substantial  productivity  losses, 
thereby posing risks to food security (Sanchez, 2002). While productivity impacts vary 
largely  by  region,  the  areas  mostly  affected  are  those  whose  populations  are  already 
suffering  from  poverty  and  hunger  (Oldeman,  1998).  The  productivity  of  some  lands 
has declined by 50 per cent owing to soil erosion and desertification (Dregne, 1990). 
Globally, the annual loss of 75 billion tons of soil costs about $400 billion per year, or 
approximately  $70  per  person  per  year  (Lal,  1998).  Soil  compaction  has  caused  yield 
reductions of between 40 and 90 per cent in West African countries (Kayombo and Lal, 
1994). Nutrient (nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium) depletion also has a severe global 
economic impact, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. In South Asia, annual economic loss 
is estimated at $500 million from waterlogging, and at $1.5 billion due to salinization 
(Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 1994). Deforestation can 
also  exacerbate  food  insecurity,  as  forests  provide  food,  inputs  and  services  that  sup-
port crop and livestock production (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United 
Nations,  2006).  In  a  case-study  analysis  of  seven  developing  countries,  Berry,  Olson 
and Campbell, (2003) estimated that problems of sustainable land management reduced 
agricultural GDP by between 3 and 7 per cent.

There is often a strong association between the distribution of poor people 
reliant  on  agriculture  and  fragile  environments.  Poor  people  are  likely  to  be  farming 
steeper land and drier, less fertile soils and in more remote areas (World Bank, 2003). 
Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia experience the highest intensity of soil degradation, 
population  growth  and  food  insecurity  (Bai  and  others,  2008;  Food  and  Agriculture 
Organization of the United Nations, 2010a). In Mexico, land degradation contributes to 
migration (Berry, Olson and Campbell, 2003). Deforestation will likely have a particu-
larly adverse impact on many of the 1.5 billion persons who depend on forests for their 
livelihoods, especially as they represent 90 per cent of those living in extreme poverty 
(World Bank, 2004).

Natural  resource  degradation  may  also  exacerbate  gender  inequalities  by 
increasing  the  time  requirement  for  fulfilment  of  female  responsibilities  such  as  food 
production, fuelwood collection, and soil and water conservation. For instance, in rural

Rajasthan, India, approximately 50 person-hours per month are required for households 
gathering fuelwood (Laxmi and others, 2003). In Malawi, women spend between 4 and 15 
hours per week collecting firewood (Rehfuess, Mehta and Prüss-Üstün, 2006).

Agricultural production systems can further adversely affect human health. 
Water pollution from inorganic fertilizers and livestock waste undermines the safety of 
drinking water and aquatic food. Pesticides negatively affect the health of farm workers 
(World Water Assessment Programme, 2003). Transportation of agricultural products has 
also promoted the cross-border spread of pests and diseases (International Assessment of 
Agricultural Knowledge, Science and Technology for Development, 2009). In addition, 
desertification-induced dust storms can cause respiratory disorders, including bronchitis 
(Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, 2005).

Drivers of unsustainable natural resource management

Natural resources 
degradation is driven 
by poor land and water 
management practices

In explaining the unprecedented global degradation and depletion of land, water and bio-
diversity, a combination of natural and human-induced factors can be identified, including 
indirect factors such as population pressure, and direct factors, such as land-use patterns.

Deterioration of natural resources are most commonly caused by poor land 
and  water  management  practices  in  a  process  driven  by  socio-economic  and  political 
factors (Bai and others, 2008). Land fragmentation and limited farm size contribute to 
inappropriate livestock management, resulting in land degradation. In addition, human-
induced climate change aggravates resource degradation through floods, droughts, fires, 
soil  changes  and  biodiversity  loss.  On  the  other  hand,  people  can  be  a  major  asset  in 
reversing resource degradation through reforestation and other sustainable land, water and 
forest management practices and technologies (Eswaran, Lal and Reich, 2001).

Underlying  unsustainable  management  of  natural  resources  are  numerous 
interconnected economic and socio-political drivers, including poverty, inequality, demo-
graphic trends, national resource allocation, land distribution and rights, political stability, 
governance and institutions, societal perceptions of and values on land, and behavioural 
consumption and production patterns. For instance, poor small-scale farm holders can 
over-exploit natural resources, particularly when facing population pressure and scarcity of 
suitable land, as is the case in the minifundias in the Andean highlands of Latin America. 
On the other hand, large-scale farming can also be a cause of land degradation through 
the excessive use of chemicals and the engagement in unsustainable land management 
practices in order to increase productivity and profits.

Small farm holders are 
at the heart of the battle 
against poverty and hunger

Food security and small farm holders

To the extent that most food is locally produced and consumed, small farm holders are 
at the heart of the food security challenge. The majority of the extremely poor and about 
half of the undernourished people in the world live in a total of 500 million farms in 
developing countries (almost 90 per cent of farms worldwide), each comprising less than 
two hectares (ha) of land (International Food Policy Research Institute, 2005).

The scale of farming varies by region, with the average farm size ranging from 
1.6 ha in Africa and Asia to over 120 ha in North America (table III.4). There is evidence 
to suggest that average farm size among small farm holdings is decreasing owing to popu-
lation pressure and land scarcity. The bottom 25 per cent of rural agricultural households

in several African countries farm, on average, less than 0.1 ha of land per capita (Jayne 
and others, 2003).

Small  farm  holders  dominate  agriculture  in  developing  countries,  where  the 
presence of women is highly significant, typically in subsistence farming. In Africa and East 
and South-East Asia, women make up over 40 per cent of the agricultural workforce (Food 
and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 2011). Estimates of the share of female 
employment in that work force range from 36 per cent in Côte d’Ivoire and the Niger to 60 
per cent in Lesotho. However, female farmers have less access to land, credit, markets and 
technology: Only 5 per cent of landholders in North Africa and West Africa are women, 
only 15 per cent in sub-Saharan Africa and only 25 per cent in a sample of countries in 
Latin America; furthermore, the average farm size is significantly smaller (ibid.).

In low-income countries, there are 3 billion people in rural areas; 2.5 billion 
are  involved  in  agriculture  and  1.5  billion  make  a  living  from  small  farms  (Food  and 
Agriculture  Organization  of  the  United  Nations,  International  Fund  for  Agricultural 
Development and International Labour Organization, 2010; Foresight, 2011). Countries 
and communities based mainly on small-scale farming are not only among the poorest, but 
also among the most threatened by ecosystem degradation (United Nations Environment 
Programme, 2002). For instance, in countries such as China and India (which, despite 
having  invested  heavily  in  rural  development,  are  home  to  most  of  the  world’s  under-
nourished people), the areas most vulnerable to food insecurity often contend with poor 
natural conditions and fragile ecologies (Xiao and Nie, 2009; M S Swaminathan Research 
Foundation and World Food Programme, 2008).

With  small-scale  farms  likely  to  dominate  the  agricultural  landscape  in  the 
foreseeable future, addressing the particular challenges they face is vital to combating pov-
erty and hunger (Dixon, Gibbon and Gulliver, 2001). While there is an emerging consensus 
among international organizations regarding the importance of strengthening the role of 
small farm holders in order to ensure the achievement of greater food security, effective 
policies need to be in place to secure the viability of small farm holders, particularly in view 
of intensification of international competition and strengthening of marketing chains and 
quality standards, and natural resource degradation (Hazell and others, 2010).

Most of the findings presented in the literature dealing with agricultural devel-
opment in low-income countries indicate that small farm units tend to show higher pro-
ductivity than large-scale farms. Small farm holders not only tend to make more intensive 
use of land and labour but also face lower transaction costs for labour. These advantages 
may  disappear,  however,  for  certain  crops  whose  cultivation  benefits  from  significant

economies of scale and input-intensive technologies, or when conditions critical for ef-
ficient farming—like marketing opportunities, quality assurance, and access to inputs, 
markets, credit and information—are lacking for small farm holders.

Poverty among small farm holders may create incentives for more intensive 
non-sustainable  resource  extraction  as  a  short-term  survival  strategy  (Lutz,  ed.,  1998). 
In northern Zambia, for instance, labour-rich households have higher incomes but they 
also cause the most deforestation (Holden, 1991). Nevertheless, Altieri (2008) notes that 
small-scale and diversified farming continues to have significant advantages over large-
scale monoculture systems in terms of productivity (20-60 per cent higher yields), food 
production and environmental protection (including climate change mitigation).

Notwithstanding recognition of the challenges faced by small farm holders, 
these findings reinforce the view that they should be assigned a prominent role in food 
security strategies. Female farmers play a particularly important role; in Africa, for exam-
ple, they account for more than half of the agricultural output (Mehra and Rojas, 2008). 
Small  farm  holders  in  developing  countries  often  experience  undernourishment  them-
selves, while remaining the main suppliers of food to urban areas. Hence, improving food 
security and even economic growth will critically depend on removing the barriers faced 
by small farm holders and expanding their productive capacity, while paying particular 
attention to the needs of female farmers.

Towards a true green technological  
revolution in agriculture

The preceding analysis makes clear that combating hunger and malnutrition in a sustain-
able manner and guarding against high and volatile food prices will require a radically 
different approach addressing the structural constraints on food production within a wider 
framework of sustainable natural resource management. This would entail both the estab-
lishment of a comprehensive national framework for sustainable use of resources, and a 
harnessing of the technology and innovation needed to increase the productivity, profit-
ability, stability, resilience and climate change mitigation potential of rural production 
systems  and  forests.  Water  conservation,  soil  protection  and  biodiversity  enhancement 
need to form part of an integrated approach of sustainable land and forest management,3
which must also integrate biophysical with sociocultural, institutional and behavioural 
variables, while recognizing the multifunctional nature of agriculture.

A holistic, cross-sectoral approach should, for instance, consider trade-offs and 
build on synergies between the forests and agriculture sectors. In view of their competi-
tive land uses, many solutions, involving difficult choices, will be reached through open 
and inclusive discussion and negotiation. On the other hand, the aforementioned syner-
gies among the sectors (resulting, inter alia, in reduced land degradation and increased 
productivity;  sustainable  water  supply;  and  green  energy  infrastructure  and  buildings) 
present important “win-win” options through better resource management facilitated by 
an enabling institutional environment.

Sustainable  land  management  is  defined  as “the  use  of  land  resources,  including  soils,  water, 
animals and plants, for the production of goods to meet changing human needs, while ensuring 
the long-term productive potential of these resources and the maintenance of their environmental 
functions”  (United  Nations,  1993).  Although  there  is  no  universally  agreed-upon  definition  for 
sustainable forest management (SFM), the United Nations Forum on Forests (UNFF) states that 
‘’sustainable  forest  management,  as  a  dynamic  and  evolving  concept,  aims  to  maintain  and 
enhance the economic, social and environmental value of all types of forests, for the benefit of 
present and future  generations” (United Nations Forum on Forests, 2007).

… within a comprehensive 
national framework for 
sustainable resource use

An agricultural innovation 
system approach can help 
accelerate the new green 
revolution

An  appropriate  institutional  setting  is  also  crucial  in  respect  of  supporting 
small-scale farming so as to increase agricultural investment and productivity and preserve 
natural resources. The State has an important role to play in building rural infrastructure 
(including roads, storage facilities and irrigation systems); improving market access (in-
cluding for credit, inputs and insurance); providing extension services and technological 
capacity-building; encouraging coordination among multiple stakeholders; and securing 
property rights (including land redistribution).

Sustainable agriculture should also be a priority in developed countries to ensure 
more efficient use of energy and a reduction in use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides. 
Large subsidies to agriculture in OECD countries, including subsidies for the production 
of biofuels (entailing a shift in production away from food crops), have led to severe imbal-
ances in the economics of agricultural production and consumption worldwide.

Government policies to stimulate a new technological revolution in agriculture 
will have to build on the rich experiences associated with innovation in the last 30 years. 
The recent literature on innovation in agriculture is using the concept of agricultural in-
novation systems to “denote the network of economic and non-economic actors, and the 
linkages amongst these actors (to) enable technological, organizational and social learning 
of the kind needed to devise context-specific solutions” (United Nations Conference on 
Trade  and  Development,  2010,  sect.  1.6).  We  propose  to  utilize  the  concept  of  a  sus-
tainable agricultural innovation system (SAIS) to focus on developing a comprehensive 
policy framework for innovation which can respond to the double challenge of increasing 
productivity in food production and environmental sustainability. The SAIS constitutes 
the agricultural pillar of the larger concept of greening the National Innovation System 
(G-NIS), as discussed in chapter V.

After  a  brief  overview  of  the  SAIS  framework,  the  present  section  identifies 
existing processes linked to technological innovation in agriculture and management of 
natural resources, including a brief review of recent experiences of innovation in sustainable 
agriculture compared with the experience of the green revolution of the 1960s and 1970s. 
Against this background, four critical objectives are singled out whose attainment requires 
strategic  policy  support  to  effect  the  transformation  to  sustainable  agriculture,  namely: 
(a) improved access to the whole range of technological options; (b) better access to sup-
portive services, including removal of the political obstacles that prevent faster productivity 
growth among small-scale farm holders; (c) gender sensitivity in agricultural innovation 
processes; and (d) strengthening cooperation and partnerships to accelerate innovation.

The sustainable agricultural innovation system framework

The SAIS perspective facilitates the recognition of the multiplicity of actors that produce 
and use global knowledge (including universities, research institutions, firms, farmers, ex-
tension  workers,  civil  society  organizations  and  private  foundations),  their  interests,  the 
institutional contexts within which interactions occur in the innovation process, and the 
dynamics of learning and institutional change (Spielman, 2005). The SAIS perspective also 
serves to underline that innovation is important, in relation not only to production, but also 
to improving processes, products and marketing, and strengthening organizations and part-
nerships within different parts of the system through the engagement of different actors.

An innovation systems perspective enables the recognition of the evolutionary 
nature of innovation—its achievement through the cumulative effect of interactions be-
tween agents on the supply and demand sides of the system, within a framework of formal 
and informal institutions, supportive policies and stakeholder involvement, as illustrated 
by the cases presented in box III.1 (Brooks and Loevinsohn, 2011).

All actors, institutions and 
processes, within the whole 
food chain must be part 
of the policy innovation 
framework …

Innovation in agriculture

The  development  of  agricultural  research  and  experimentation  has  not  been  weak,  even  in  the 
most challenged regions in Africa (United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, 2010), 
although they have lacked appropriate support to ensure widespread benefits. The two successful 
experiences discussed below illustrate the contribution of multiple stakeholders to achieving rapid 
improvement in the productivity of small farm holders with environmentally sustainable practices. 
Direct participation of small farm holders in a process of continuous learning and adaptation was a 
key factor of success.
The System of Rice Intensification (SRI)
Rice is the single most important staple of the poor, especially in Asia. Under current practices of the 
continuous flooding of fields and the heavy use of inorganic fertilizers, rice production is one of the 
main sources of methane gas emissions and one of the main causes of the contamination of land and 
water. It is estimated that 24-30 per cent of the freshwater utilized worldwide is for the production 
of rice.

With support from Africare, Oxfam America, the WWF-ICRISAT Project and the World 
Bank, an innovation known as the System of Rice Intensification (SRI) has been successfully tested 
in  40  countries  with  impressive  results.  With  simple  changes  in  the  management  of  crops  entail-
ing transplantation into non-flooded fields of fewer seeds at a younger age and with wider spaces 
between them, in addition to broader use of organic fertilizers and integrated pest control manage-
ment, crops become more resistant to climate variations, pests and diseases. Depending on local 
conditions, yields may increase by up to 50 per cent. Water savings have ranged between 25 and 50 
per cent; input cost savings per hectare are estimated to be 23 per cent, due mainly to the use of 
fewer agrochemicals; and farmers’ incomes have increased substantially.

According to Brooks and Loevinsohn (2011, p. 11): “In India, which appears to have the 
largest area under SRI, ‘learning alliances’ have been formed that exchange experiences and take the 
lead in interactions with government … (especially at local level) … notably in Andhra Pradesh, Tamil 
Nadu and Tripura.” However, the involvement of formal research institutions has been more marginal, 
with some positive experiences in China and Indonesia. The Governments of Cambodia, China, India, 
Indonesia and Viet Nam have endorsed these innovations and included them as part of their national 
strategies for food security (Africare, Oxfam America and WWF-ICRISAT Project, 2010, p. 3).
The Farm Field School approach
Prompted by widespread environmental pollution and occupational poisoning in South-East Asia 
as a result of heavy use of pesticides, research institutions have developed the underpinnings of an 
integrated approach to improving pest control management through the conservation of beneficial 
insects (spiders and planthoppers, among others) and better management of the ecology of farm-
ers’ fields. Farmer Field Schools (FFS), which were developed over 10 years in the Philippines and 
Indonesia, have provided an opportunity for farmers to learn through observation and experimenta-
tion in the field.

With  support  from  the  Government  of  Indonesia,  the  United  States  Agency  for 
International Development and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the FFS 
approach has spread to other developing countries (namely, Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, India, the 
Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Nepal, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Viet Nam) and been 
adapted to various farming systems. The range of management skills has been extended to include 
the production of vegetables, cotton, potatoes, tree crops, fruits, maize, poultry and dairy cows, soil 
fertility management, land and water management, groundwater management, conservation agri-
culture, land degradation management, agroforestry, community forestry, fishing and preservation 
of biodiversity.

The agricultural innovation system that emerged from the experiences of integrated 
pest  management  and  the  Farmer  Field  Schools  was  made  possible  through  active  participation 
of  multiple  stakeholders.  National  and  international  research  institutions  in  the  Philippines  and 
Indonesia have provided scientific knowledge to the Farmer Field Schools while non-governmental

… so as to be able to 
support the design of 
effective mechanisms for 
enhancing innovation in 
sustainable agriculture

Policy must support local 
innovations

organizations in Indonesia have developed the pedagogic process needed to facilitate adult learning. 
Bilateral donors and international organizations (such as FAO) were critical in supporting the creation 
of Farmer Field Schools in other countries through financial contributions, provision of information 
and advocacy.

There are now FFS projects operating in 87 countries in Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, Latin 
America and the Caribbean, East and North Africa, Central and Eastern Europe, the United States of 
America and Western Europe. The FFS approach has contributed to the development of improved 
skills among farmers, a greater demand for information and a greater flexibility in the managing of 
their crops.

The policy challenge is how to move beyond the recognition of a multiplic-
ity of innovative experiences towards the design of interventions and policies capable of 
stimulating and supporting the innovative capacity of the actors (farmers, civil society 
organizations and corporations) that are part of the food production system. The literature 
identifies two trajectories for fostering and supporting innovation: the “orchestrated tra-
jectory” induced by policy and the “opportunity trajectory” triggered by market signals. 
Brooks and Loevinsohn (2011) extends this framework by adding an “endogenous” trajec-
tory which emerges in local contexts.

These parallel trajectories intersect in each country at the point where knowl-
edge and innovation are generated. Policies should aim to strengthen interactions among 
the various processes so as to ensure that innovation contributes simultaneously to pov-
erty reduction, food security and environmental sustainability. Those objectives are not 
served if innovation is driven merely by profit motives, as is the case for most agricultural 
activities. Further, traditional public-private partnerships have not been very successful 
in directing innovation efforts towards achieving the objectives set out in a sustainable 
development agenda (Hall, 2010).

The challenge for policymakers is how to identify and support promising inno-
vation trajectories in a context where the adoption of new technology and crop management 
practices has a mixed record of successes and failures and where many contentious issues 
are  not  easily  resolved.  Questions  about  what  constitutes  effective  interventions  persist, 
including: should the priority be building technical capacity of farmers or promoting estab-
lished technological practices and products (Brooks and Loevinsohn, 2011); and should the 
strategy be one of strengthening farmers’ organizations or improving their links with input 
suppliers. In order to respond to these questions, the management of rural development 
programmes needs to undergo a deep transformation of its own. The application of public 
policy and project management tools (logical frameworks and monitoring and evaluation 
systems) needs to become less rigid and more flexible and adaptive so as to be able to move 
beyond a narrow focus on outcomes and towards the strengthening of innovative processes 
(Berdegué, 2005). The very common practice, for example, of focusing on the replication (or 
scaling up) of successful innovative experiences may be too narrow to stimulate experimen-
tation and learning, which would necessarily include the capacity to learn from failure.

A policy agenda with the capacity to stimulate innovation demands radical 
changes in the institutions and mechanisms that presently support agricultural develop-
ment. A process of learning and innovation needs to unfold within public institutions—one 
that facilitates the adoption of a strategic focus on innovation and nationwide institutional 
changes in support of a techno-institutional agenda for food security under which local 
innovations can prosper (Leeuwis and Hall, 2010).

Building on existing approaches to technological innovation 
in agriculture and natural resource management

Local innovation in sustainable agriculture

Local  farmers  and  communities  have  shown  great  capacity  to  innovate  in  response  to 
weather and other shocks. There are thousands of successful experiences of localized en-
hanced pest and weed management, water efficiency and biodiversity, including stories 
of highly successful innovation in the most challenging circumstances characterized by 
a poor natural resource base and widespread poverty (World Bank, 2007a, 2008c; Thapa 
and Broomhead, 2010; Spielman and Pandya-Lorch, 2009; Africare, Oxfam America and 
WWF-ICRISAT Project, 2010; Pretty and others, 2006).

Local communities and 
farmers are constantly 
innovating in response  
to shocks …

… and many of 
their innovations 
entail the adoption 
of environmentally 
sustainable practices …

… but they often lack 
the resources to expand 
production and apply their 
experiences beyond the 
local context

Large-scale efforts in 
sustainable agriculture 
intensification …

Pretty and others (2006) assessed 286 sustainable innovation experiences in 57 
poor countries encompassing 37 million hectares.4 In four years, and with wide variations 
across the 12.6 million farms evaluated, there were large and significant increases in crop 
yields (79 per cent on average), greater water efficiency, evidence of carbon sequestration 
and a reduction in pesticide use of 70.8 per cent associated with an average yield increase 
of 41.6 per cent.

Most often, innovation experiences among local farmers and rural communi-
ties are part of their survival strategies in response to soil depletion, water scarcity, HIV/
AIDS, catastrophic events and other negative factors; however, typically, the conditions 
needed to utilize these experiences on a larger scale are lacking. While indigenous female 
workers  have  experience  in  the  management  of  biodiversity  and  traditional  knowledge 
for sustainable agriculture, poor access to land, inputs and credit has often prevented the 
expansion of that successful experience (World Bank, 2009).

Nevertheless, there are several well-known examples of innovations with large-
scale impacts. The integrated pest management (IPM) approach, proliferating Farm Field 
Schools and the System of Rice Intensification (SRI) are good examples of creative in-
novation that achieved large-scale impacts through highly effective collaboration among 
multiple stakeholders (see box III.1).

Other large-impact innovations encompass the networks of millers and politi-
cians that popularized the use of NERICA (New Rice for Africa) in Africa, the handmade 
paper industry in Nepal, the organization of small-scale producers to export mangos in 
India,  the  diffusion  of  micro-irrigation  in  Bangladesh  (Hall,  Dijkman  and  Sulaiman, 
2010) and watershed management in India (box III.2), among many others.5

Agricultural  sustainability  centres  on  the  adoption  of  technology  and  practices  designed  to 
increase  food  production  without  negative  environmental  impacts.  The  projects  evaluated 
encompassed 3 per cent of cultivated area in developing countries.
The World Bank (2007a) documented eight case studies in Asia, Africa and Latin America; and more 
recently, Juma (2011) published several case studies from around the world. However, there are 
many more case studies in the literature, including on the practice of national and international

Watershed development in India

In  India,  watersheds—namely,  land  drained  by  a  common  watercourse—have  been  the  focus  of 
increasing development efforts in recent decades. These areas of intense poverty and food insecurity 
tend to be characterized by eroded slopes and degraded pastures and forests.

Early watershed restoration projects had focused on the physical symptoms of degra-
dation by building infrastructure designed to retain water and slow erosion, as well as by banning 
grazing and harvesting of forest products on the ridges. While these projects achieved striking visual 
results and benefited farmers in the lower reaches, they nevertheless negatively impacted women 
and  landless  and  marginalized  peasants  who  depended  on  fodder  and  forest  products  from  the 
upper parts.

In the 1970s, a number of innovative village-level projects were initiated, granting lan-
dless people, including women, rights to use the additional surface water that was generated, in 
exchange for their collaboration in conserving soil and vegetation in the upper watershed. They were 
then able to sell the water to farmers or use it on rented land.

The  substantial  environmental  and  socio-economic  benefits  conferred  by  these 
projects inspired further efforts by both Governments and non-governmental organizations, includ-
ing the expansion of employment opportunities based on natural resources and local opportunities 
outside agriculture. When well conceived and executed, such programmes can result in significant 
gains in farm output, ecological protection, employment for the landless, gender parity and female 
empowerment.

Overall, watershed development in India highlights the importance of the participation 
of diverse actors and attention to local contexts in harnessing environmental innovations that can 
produce multiple, equitable and sustainable benefits.

Loevinsohn (2011).

The adoption of sustainable practices in agriculture is supporting the applica-
tion of the emergent concept of “sustainable agriculture intensification”, also known as 
the “agroecological approach”, “ecologically intensive agriculture” and “low-external input 
technology”  (International  Fund  for  Agricultural  Development,  2011).  Those  practices 
have several points in common:

… are based on explicit 
support from Governments, 
multilateral and civil society 
organizations, and donors 
working directly with local 
farmers

•	

•	

•	

Successful experiences have been based on direct involvement of farmers in 
learning and innovation aimed at adapting knowledge, technology and man-
agement practices to the local context
Active  participation  by  various  actors  including  Governments,  non-govern-
mental  organizations,  and  multilateral  organizations  has  been  critical  not 
only to scaling up innovations, but also to disseminating knowledge, building 
capacity among farmers, fostering trust and reducing the risks associated with 
new technology and agricultural practices
Adjustments  in  the  rules,  norms  and  values  of  the  institutions  governing 
agricultural research and development (R&D), and practices, have also been 
important in inducing behavioural change among farmers (to encourage them 
to adopt new practices), redefining the role of women and establishing closer 
interacting networks
Successful innovative experiences with large welfare gains for small-scale farm 
holders, rural communities and the poor are those where technical knowledge is made 
relevant and accessible to farmers and is accompanied by an enabling environment within 
which they can overcome the constraints that they face in respect of adopting new tech-
nology and agricultural practices (Berdegué, 2005).

Agricultural research and development during 
the green revolution of the 1960s and 1970s

Not too long ago, developing countries and donors had responded to widespread poverty 
and  food  insecurity  with  policies  that  induced  a  profound  transformation  of  the  rural 
economy. The so-called green revolution of the 1960s and 1970s brought new technology 
and innovation to farmers in Asia and Latin America as part of an effort to increase food 
production at a time when close to one third of the world’s population (1 billion people) 
were vulnerable to hunger and malnutrition (Spielman and Pandya-Lorch, 2009).

Technological innovations were based on breeding new crop varieties, mainly 
wheat, rice and maize that were more resistant to pests and disease and more responsive to 
chemical nutrients and that allowed double- and even triple-cropping (International Food 
Policy Research Institute, 2002). In Asia, cereal production increased from 313 million 
to 650 million tons per year between 1970 and 1995; and countries in Asia and Latin 
America saw higher calorie intake per person and a substantial increase in real per capita 
income, with subsequent poverty reduction (Hazell, 2009).

As in the original green 
revolution, sustainable 
agriculture for food security 
needs long-term research 
support, adequate investments 
for rural development, and 
institutional reform

Three lessons can be 
learned from the first  
green revolution

The technological innovation and diffusion triggered by the green revolution 
were  facilitated  by  a  large  and  interconnected  system  of  international  research  centres, 
coordinated by the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) 
and sustained with adequate funding from developed and developing countries and private 
donors. These centres sustained research operations, gene banks and nursery programmes 
in an environment of open and free exchange of information and plant genetic materials 
(Dubin  and  Brennan,  2009).  The  budgets  available  to  CGIAR  centres  grew  from  $15 
million in 1970 to $305 million in 1990 (Pardey and Beintema, 2001).

Governments expanded rural roads, irrigation and electrical power facilities, 
and improved storage facilities. Basic education, agricultural research and extension serv-
ices to support farmers also improved, and international lending for agricultural develop-
ment was prioritized.

Unfortunately, the “technical package” that accompanied the green revolution 
was not replicable in regions with different agroecological conditions in terms of climate, 
soil, weeds and pests, most notably sub-Saharan Africa, and where the consumption of sta-
ples was more diversified so as to include millet, sorghum, and cassava, of which improved 
varieties would come much later. Also, the technology arising from the green revolution 
was based on intensive use of fertilizers, chemical pesticides and water, which had negative 
environmental impacts.

Three important lessons derived from the experience of the green revolution 
are relevant to the discussion of a new wave of transformations in agriculture, namely, 
that: (a) the development of new technology requires long-term financial support for R&D 
and effective and free flow and dissemination of information; (b)  the adoption of new 
technology requires an enabling institutional framework and large investment in infra-
structure, and capacity development among farmers, as well as access to inputs, credits and 
markets; and (c) innovations in agriculture require long-term commitments from national 
Governments and other international stakeholders. Going forward, the environmental im-
pact of agriculture is a major concern. New technology and a radical reform in agricultural 
practices will be needed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, land degradation, and over-
exploitation and contamination of water tables, and to increase the carbon sequestration 
capacity of agriculture and forestry.

Towards a truly green revolution for food security

89

Multiple technological options need to be made 
available in response to multiple challenges

There is no one technology 
that fits all …

… but a wide range of 
technology options need to 
be made available to meet 
farmers’ specific needs …

… including traditional 
knowledge and practices

In contrast with the experience of the green revolution, which relied on the adoption of a 
“technical package” on a large scale, achieving food security in today’s context will require 
faster productivity gains among a large number of small-scale producers in very different 
agroecological regions. There is no single “technical solution” to simplify the quest for 
more rapid productivity and environmental sustainability gains. Instead, a whole range of 
technical options need to be made available to farmers.

An  extensive  menu  of  technologies  and  a  wealth  of  sustainable  practices  in 
agriculture are available to spearhead the radical transformation required to increase food 
production without a major expansion of cultivated areas and a further depletion of natu-
ral resources. A recent study found that important productivity gains, of the order of a 
two- to threefold increase in average yields in Africa, for example, can be achieved through 
better use of existing knowledge and technology (Foresight, 2011). Similarly, FAO (2011) 
estimates that with better access by women to land, external inputs and technology, agri-
cultural production in developing countries could increase by as much as 2.5-4.0 per cent, 
and the number of undernourished people could decline by between 12 and 17 per cent 
(that is, 100 million-150 million people could be free of hunger).

Traditional technologies and practices have proved their relevance to increasing 
productivity and ensuring environmental sustainability: for example, low-tillage farming, 
crop rotation and interplanting, water harvesting and recycling, water-efficient cropping, 
green manure utilization, agroforestry and integrated pest management have been success-
fully adopted with large productivity gains.

The technology that emerged from the green revolution will continue to play 
an important role in the development of new crop breeding and higher-yielding varieties 
with substantial productivity gains, although continuing innovations will be needed for 
reducing the use of external inputs and increasing efficiency of water so as to reduce nega-
tive environmental impacts.

While  modern  developments  in  biotechnology,  genetic  engineering,  food 
irradiation,6 hydroponics and anaerobic digestion promise to improve the resistance of 
food crops to pests and extreme weather, increase their nutritional value, and reduce food 
contamination and greenhouse gas emissions, appropriate incentives to expand research 
on crops and processes of relevance to the poor need to be put in place.

There is very little that can be said, in general, about the choice of technologies 
that respond to the specific needs of farmers in diverse agroecological regions except that 
making those technologies available as options to small farm holders requires a new policy 
framework and additional investments in rural development. In Asia and some countries 
in Latin America, where the technologies derived from the green revolution led to overuse 
of agrochemicals and the depletion of water tables, Governments may need to reconsider 
whether to continue subsidizing the use of fertilizers and pesticides or to facilitate access to 
sustainable technology in order to increase the use of organic fertilizers and efficient water 
management. In sub-Saharan Africa, where small-scale farm holders generally use a frac-
tion of the recommended levels of external inputs, decreasing food insecurity may require

Food irradiation is a physical process that exposes foods to a highly penetrating form of energy—
gamma  rays  or  high-energy  electrons—which  can  uniformly  deactivate  the  DNA  of  unwanted 
microorganisms  without  changing  the  basic  nature  of  the  treated  food.  It  is  a  safe  and  cost-
effective way to eliminate food contaminants.

A radical rethinking of 
policy objectives and tool 
design is required …

infrastructure and 
expanded access to  
credit and technology

The institutional failures 
that perpetuate poverty 
also need to be removed

the devising of new incentives to increase the use of chemical inputs in combination with 
sustainable technology and practices.

From a policy perspective, the problem is how to increase awareness and stimu-
late the adoption of sustainable technology and crop management practices. The policy 
challenge becomes ever more complicated when there are trade-offs between increasing 
food production and halting environmental degradation, as in the case of the extensive 
provision of subsidies to agrochemicals so as to increase food production in spite of their 
negative environmental impact. In many developing countries, reconciliation of these two 
objectives—food security and environmental sustainability—will require a radical trans-
formation of current policy objectives, including a wider dissemination of information and 
technical support to small-scale farmers through adequate extension services, the removal 
of political constraints and appropriate incentives for building stronger partnerships with 
a multiplicity of stakeholders, as discussed below.

Expanding support services and land reform and  
overcoming political obstacles to agrarian change

In the context of food-insecure countries, striking a delicate balance between large pro-
ductivity gains and environmental sustainability will require additional investments and 
improved  capacities  to  implement  national  strategies  for  food  security  that  lead  to:  an 
increase  in  access  of  small  farmers  to  technology;  an  increase  in  investments  aimed  at 
expanding the rural road infrastructure and crop storage facilities; secure land tenure and 
improved  rental  agreements;  expansion  of  rural  credit  and  innovative  mechanisms  for 
weather-based crop insurance; and improved access to information and information and 
communications (ICT) technology.

To  the  extent  that  innovation  is  strongly  associated  with  risk-taking,  risk-
reduction  mechanisms  need  to  be  introduced  to  avert  devastating  losses  of  income  of 
small farm holders. Grants, tax incentives, innovative insurance policies and new forms of 
venture capital may be able to provide this kind of protection (Leeuwis and Hall, 2010).
The policy challenge resides in how to mobilize the resources needed to ex-
pand the range of supportive services that are critical to improving the capacity of small 
farm  holders  to  innovate  and  to  compete  in  dynamic  markets.  Increasing  investments 
for rural development and shifting the focus of attention towards support of small-scale 
farm holders will require, in many contexts, overcoming the obstacles put in the path of 
change by prevailing power relations (Spielman, 2005). Rural poverty and food insecurity 
are frequently the result of “institutional failures” (including coordination failures, land 
insecurity, gender discrimination and marginalization of indigenous populations), which 
prevent the development of more dynamic food production systems.

One of the most contentious issues in most counties is land distribution. To a 
large extent, low income and food insecurity among small-scale farm holders can be traced 
back to the lack of adequate access to land. Traditional land reform designed to improve 
access to land and provide support to different forms of association among farmers would 
help to effect economies of scale in production and, most importantly, in the marketing of 
food crops. However, changing land distribution practices, securing property rights and 
creating incentives that benefit small farm holders often require the formation of political 
coalitions that might challenge the status quo.

In  countries  like  Brazil,  China  and  India,  whose  Governments  had  chosen 
to prioritize poverty reduction and food security, dynamic innovation systems emerged 
in support of agricultural development. In other instances, the scaling up of innovative 
practices—inter alia, for rice intensification, for farmers’ training and in the case of India, 
for the watershed initiative mentioned above—was possible through the endorsement by 
international organizations, national non-governmental organizations and local govern-
ments of new practices in support of dissemination of knowledge, greater participation by 
and capacity development of farmers, building of missing infrastructure and improving 
access to credit, information and other supportive services.

National strategies for food security and sustainable agriculture need to explicitly 
recognize the politico-economic obstacles to inducing a radical transformation in agriculture 
that is focused on improving the productive capacity of small-scale food producers.

Gender-sensitive agricultural innovation

Unless policies to promote innovation in agriculture have an explicit gender focus, women 
will continue to be disadvantaged with respect to accessing new technologies and sup-
portive services. Women in rural areas face major labour constraints as a result of their 
multiple responsibilities: besides providing traditional family care, rural women are typi-
cally responsible for fetching water and firewood, tending animals and farming the house 
garden and often engage in wage employment. Simple labour-saving tools (including green 
cooking stoves and appropriate tools for planting and weeding) and better access to water 
for house consumption would help ease their time constraints.

It is important in fostering the creation of a dynamic innovation system that 
addresses  women’s  needs,  to  grasp  the  impact  of  the  institutions  and  local  values  that 
define  their  role.  Very  often,  the  creation  of  gender-sensitive  systems  of  innovation  in 
agriculture will also require a radical transformation of the institutional constraints that 
prevent better access by women to secure land tenure, credit and technical assistance.

Innovative partnerships

Successful  innovation  experiences  in  the  last  30  years  demonstrate  the  importance  of 
building  partnerships  among  multiple  stakeholders  so  as  to  strengthen  the  capacity  of 
small-scale farm holders to access technology, inputs and larger markets. While the cor-
porate private sector has played an increasingly important role in accelerating innovation 
in agriculture through a variety of mechanisms, the risk of excluding small-scale farmers 
is also large. Through appropriate regulation to prevent monopolistic practices in food 
markets, and better access to information, credits and risk insurance, small-scale farm 
holders would be in a better position to engage in mutually beneficial partnerships with 
the corporate private sector.

Perhaps one of the most important drivers of change in recent years lies in 
the transformation in food retailing. The emergence of large supermarket chains, which 
control between 40 and 50 per cent of the food market in Latin America, about 10 per 
cent in China, 30 per cent in South Africa and 50 per cent in Indonesia, has concentrated 
the purchase of large quantities of food subject to strict quality standards, a phenomenon 
that has led to the displacement of traditional wholesalers and small retail shops. For small 
farm holders, participating in these markets depends on their capacity to meet strict qual-
ity standards and to achieve concerted commercialization of their products through coop-
eratives and other forms of association. The risk of exclusion, however, is large, especially

for farms in remote and difficult to access areas (Berdegué, 2005). Technical assistance to 
farmers in meeting with quality standards would help to expand their opportunities for 
participation in larger markets.

The proliferation of ethical and environmental certification processes in recent 
years is opening new opportunities for creating value chains that link small farm holders to 
larger exporting markets. For instance, voluntary standards and certification programmes 
in the banana industry address a wide range of issues including environmental protection, 
labour rights, safety and health at work, social equity and the welfare of local communities.7
These can have substantial benefits for participating producers and traders by providing 
price premiums; improving market access and stability; helping to rationalize production, 
reduce costs, improve labour management and enhance the morale and participation of 
workers; improving the company image; and even aiding in the conservation of productive 
natural resources. Nevertheless, other types of standards aimed at food safety, quality, 
traceability and good agricultural practices, which are mainly developed by large firms in 
major markets, tend not to ensure price premiums, and may thus harm small-scale banana 
growers by significantly raising the costs they incur (Food and Agriculture Organization 
of the United Nations, 2008).

Payments for ecological services with resources from businesses interested in 
protecting hydrologic services and Governments can play an important role in increasing 
the incomes of poor rural communities and maintaining ecological diversity (box III.3). 
However, new mechanisms for expanding payments for environmental services (PES) to 
small farm holders for the protection of natural resources, to conserve biodiversity and to 
increase carbon sequestration in agriculture and forestry need to be in place.

Payment for ecosystem services in Costa Rica

One approach to encouraging the conservation and restoration of forest ecosystems is to pay private 
landowners directly for conservation (Ferraro and Simpson, 2000). Payments for reforestation, forest 
management and conservation lead to improvement of the livelihoods of individuals and communi-
ties engaged in forestry.

In Costa Rica, alarming rates of deforestation in the 1970s led to the pioneering of a 
national-level payments for environmental services (PES) programme, facilitated by the recognition 
of ecosystem services in forest protection legislation in 1996. In this market-based system, landown-
ers receive direct payments for environmental services provided by forestry ecosystems, including 
(a) mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions; (b) hydrologic services; (c) biodiversity conservation; and 
(d) provision of scenic beauty for purposes of promoting recreation and ecotourism (Malavasi and 
Kellenberg, 2002).

The national PES scheme is credited with having stopped the destruction of the Costa 
Rican rainforest and recapturing over one quarter of the country’s land mass-to-forest cover in the 
period from 1987 to 2000. The scheme has also enhanced social development by rewarding more 
than 7,000 small- to medium-scale private landowners for the environmental services their property 
provides (Pax Natura, 2011).

In 2008, the programme’s budget was close to $13 million for an area of 652,000 hec-
tares. The programme receives funds from businesses interested in protecting hydrologic services, 
which are matched by government funding from a fossil fuel tax, and multilateral loans and grants 
(Ecosystem Marketplace, 2010).

Civil society organizations

and other groups

important for strengthening 
fair and dynamic partnerships

Resources for agricultural 
research and development 
are limited and highly 
concentrated

Civil society organizations and private philanthropies are becoming important 
players  in  the  area  of  agricultural  innovation.  Most  of  the  recent  stories  of  innovation 
characterized  by  pro-poor  and  positive  environmental  impacts  have  entailed  the  active 
participation of international and national civil society organizations, which engage in 
different activities depending on the context: advocacy and lobbying for pro-poor institu-
tional change in rural areas; serving as intermediaries between research and agricultural 
practices;  capacity-building  among  farmers  and  the  dissemination  of  information  and 
good practices; facilitating collective action and creation of farmers’ organizations for the 
purchase of inputs and marketing of food; aiding in the creation of value chains so as to 
help reduce transaction costs; protecting against risk through creation of informal safety 
nets for farmers; strengthening the capacity of women to participate in marketing produc-
tion and innovation; and, in the case of private philanthropies, directly funding research, 
capacity-building and access to technology.

Each type of activity has its own dynamic which does not necessarily interlock 
with others. Each actor will also have its own special interests whose pursuit may not always 
translate into improved welfare and enhanced innovative capacity of small farm holders.

Government policies have an important role to play in enhancing the contribu-
tion of the multiple stakeholders that are part of the Sustainable Agricultural Innovation 
System and creating a regulatory framework to “promote trust and cooperation, delimita-
tion of contributions and rewards, timely information on compliance of obligations, en-
forcement of agreements, recognition and protection of the rights of each party” (Berdegué, 
2005, p. 21). While any Government’s policy will have to respond to the specific context of 
its own country, building stronger partnerships within an SAIS will require participants to 
collaborate in developing a clear-cut strategy directed towards achieving the objectives of 
agricultural reform while ensuring that there are resources adequate for expanding rural 
infrastructure and supporting provision of services to small-scale farmers.

National strategies for support of  
education, science and technology  
in addressing food security
Reviving agricultural R&D

At  the  heart  of  the  food  security  problem  is  insufficient  investment  support  for,  and 
public  attention  focused  on,  small-scale  farmers  whose  food  production  is  mostly  for 
local consumption. Since the 1980s, international support for agricultural research has 
decreased and national agricultural research centres have scaled back their programmes 
for the production and distribution of seeds (Dubin and Brennan, 2009). Expenditures for 
agricultural R&D in Africa, East and South-East Asia (excluding China) and the Middle 
East remain low (figure III.9).

Moreover, agricultural R&D investment is largely concentrated in a few coun-
tries. In 2000, developed countries accounted for 57 per cent of total public agricultural 
R&D. Among developing countries in Asia and the Pacific, China and India were respon-
sible for 67 per cent of such investments; and in Latin America, Brazil alone accounted for 
45 per cent of the total. In sub-Saharan Africa, annual agricultural R&D investment had 
grown by 0.6 per cent in 1981-2000, contracting slightly during the 1990s (Beintema and 
Elliott, 2009).

While the corporate private sector has become a substantial player in agricul-
tural R&D, especially in the production of agricultural chemical inputs, machinery and 
biotechnology, its focus has been centred largely on profitable research targeted towards 
meeting the demands of wealthy consumers and on intermediate inputs for large farmers 
(Ervin, Glenna and Jussaume, 2010).

While current agricultural knowledge and technology provide a range of alter-
natives for achieving sustainable agriculture, the adoption of new practices and technology 
requires additional investment in research and development to ensure adaptation to the 
diversity of agroecological conditions in which small-scale farm holders operate. In addi-
tion, rapidly changing climate patterns and food markets require continuous research and 
the development of new technology and crop management. Explicit national education, 
science  and  technology  strategies  are  essential  to  accelerating  productivity  growth  and 
environmental  sustainability  and  there  are  three  areas  of  development  that  need  to  be 
addressed by any national science and technology strategy for food security: agricultural 
research and development, including through the private sector; improved technical as-
sistance  to  small-scale  farm  holders,  mainly  through  extension  services;  and  improved 
education of farmers, including innovative mechanisms for peer learning.

Agricultural research and development for food security

In drafting a national strategy for education, science and technology, it is important to 
have a clear picture of the agricultural research architecture so as to be able to identify the 
institutions currently involved, their interests, and the type of research that those institu-
tions undertake. Such a perspective will facilitate the design of appropriate incentives to

facilitate effective collaboration among scientists, farmers, the corporate private sector and 
non-governmental organizations. A clear mapping of the relationships among objectives, 
actors and resources will help to leverage existing capacities so as to facilitate the process 
of building dynamic Sustainable Agricultural Innovation Systems.

Public agricultural R&D for food security

Agricultural research should consider climatic, soil and water conditions of the relevant 
agroecological region; technology and know-how are not easily transferable across regions 
without additional investment in adaptation (Pardey and Beintema, 2001). Hence, adapta-
tion of technology to particular farming conditions should be central to the agenda of 
public research institutions in developing countries.

Agricultural R&D is the classic example of a public good: in the absence of 
public sector involvement, underinvestment in agricultural R&D will continue, especially 
in those areas where markets are small and consumers poor (the case of staples in develop-
ing countries is particularly relevant in this regard). The importance of farmers’ capacity to 
innovate and adapt technology to their particular needs is widely recognized, but this has 
to be complemented—and is often guided—by formal agricultural R&D.

Public institutions will continue to be the major source of formal agricultural 
R&D in developing countries; the significant economies of size, scale and scope that are 
achievable in agricultural research cause even private research to rely on the basic research and 
innovation originating in public institutions (ibid.). With few exceptions, national research 
institutions in developing countries lack adequate resources to operate efficiently through 
appropriate infrastructure, competitive salaries and research funds. Instability in operational 
budgets compromises their independence and capacity to operate efficiently. Agricultural 
research  is  cumulative  and  has  long  maturity  cycles;  discontinuity  in  funding  and  poor 
documentation of processes exacerbate permanent loss of knowledge. The development of a 
new variety of wheat, rice or corn, for example, requires 7-10 years of breeding (ibid.).

Regular allocations of public resources are important for maintaining research 
infrastructure and adequate salaries for scientific personnel. Funds generated internally 
from the sale of products and services (such as seeds and laboratory services) are becoming 
important  in  countries  like  Chile,  China  and  Indonesia  and  may  complement  regular 
budgets. Yet the competition aimed at securing resources from different sources, which 
are often driven by commercial interests or by donor preferences, rather than by social and 
environmental concerns, leads to fragmentation of research objectives. Careful evaluation 
of funding sources helps to prevent diversion of research away from its focus on public 
goods (Echeverria and Beintema, 2009).

In addition to stable financial resources, public research institutions also re-
quire a radical change in their current linear hierarchic model of operation so as to improve 
their responsiveness to the needs of farmers, including through joint experimentation and 
learning.

Public research institutions also need to expand their traditional disciplinary 
approach to encompass an interdisciplinary focus in response to wide-ranging farmer de-
mands. Transformation of diverse agroecological rural economies requires the expertise of 
biologists, agronomists, water engineers, nutritionists, economists and social and political 
scientists (Lipton, 2010). Participation of women, especially in sub-Saharan Africa where 
women constitute a large proportion of the agricultural labour force, will also be critical to 
enhancing their low levels of representation and decision-making in agricultural research 
and extension services and to addressing their specific needs.

Building the capacity of national public research centres is a long-term process 
requiring  substantial  and  sustainable  investments  and  radical  changes  in  their  organi-
zational culture. Much of agricultural R&D resources in developing countries are con-
centrated in a few countries—Brazil, China and India—which have developed dynamic 
systems of innovation with capacity to engage in frontier research. In the case of small 
and poor countries, pooling resources to strengthen regional research agendas is perhaps 
the most effective option for improving their collective capacity. Promising experiences 
of regional and South-South agricultural cooperation include, for instance, agreements 
between research institutions of Brazil and China and African institutions.

Private sector research in climate-resistant crops

Through biotechnology, it 
may be possible to develop 
crops of great utility  
to the poor …

… but the research agenda 
needs to be expanded to 
include consumption crops 
in poor countries

Rapid technological innovation for achieving food security and tackling climate change 
will  require  closer  collaboration  with  the  private  sector  towards  expanding  research  in 
frontier areas. While the corporate private sector has increased its role in the development 
of technology in agriculture, we have chosen to focus attention below on private research 
in biotechnology, which remains controversial.

Biotechnology has the potential to improve crop varieties grown by the poor, 
by making them herbicide-resistant, less dependent on chemical pesticides and more resil-
ient to water stress and by conferring on them a greater nutritional value. Biotechnology 
may therefore be able to respond to the variety of agroecological conditions in poor and 
food-insecure regions, provided the current research agenda can be expanded to reflect the 
challenges faced by small-scale farm holders. So far, private research in biotechnology has 
concentrated on the development of products that can be easily protected by patents and 
focused mainly on building resistance to weeds and insects in profitable plants (mainly 
soybeans, corn, cotton and canola), which are of interest to large-scale farmers.

While it is technically feasible to expand the research agenda to better con-
tribute to food security, independent assessments of the larger impacts of this technology 
are urgently needed. Biotechnology has not fully responded to concerns about long-term 
environmental impacts and possible spillover effects to wild plant varieties. Bt cotton8 and 
corn, for example, use less herbicides and pesticides, but if these crop varieties develop 
resistance to the less toxic chemical herbicides and pesticides, future more toxic inputs 
may be required.

In  addition,  recent  research  has  found  that  the  problem  of  gene  flow,  the 
spread of genes from genetically engineered (GE) crops into non-GE ones, is a more seri-
ous phenomenon than was originally thought. In this case, adoption of transgenic crops 
could have large negative ecological implications if “GE crops are adopted more widely in 
developing countries where domesticated crops have wild relatives” (Ervin, Glenna and 
Jussaume, 2010, p. 7).

Going forward, better understanding of the consequences of transgenics based 
on full disclosure of information, including rigorous assessments on a case-by-case basis, 
will be critical to informing decisions about the deployment of this technology on a larger 
scale in developing countries.

One legitimate concern in exploring the potential of biotechnology to con-
tribute to food security and sustainable agriculture is the concentration of research and 
products in two large firms: DuPont Pioneer and Monsanto, which account for the largest

proportion  of  the  genetically  modified  crop  acreage  in  the  world  (Ervin,  Glenna  and 
Jussaume, 2010). The cost of seeds and inputs may discourage use of this technology by 
small  farm  holders,  especially  if  the  market  continues  to  be  dominated  by  a  few  large 
companies which exert influence over prices.9

Yet, biotechnology can still be an effective instrument for facilitating the trans-
formation of agriculture in poor agroecological regions with low productive capacity under 
current technology (namely, in parts of Africa, Central America and Asia with degraded 
natural resources). However, the structure of incentives and governance of innovation in 
this area require radical changes, which ensure, inter alia, that (a) the objectives of food 
production and environmental sustainability become central to the research agenda in bio-
technology; (b) all stakeholders, but especially small farm holders, can actively participate 
in shaping the research agenda; (c) scientific researchers consider the needs of small farm 
holders, consumer tastes and the characteristics of local markets and contexts; (d) there is 
full disclosure and an open flow of information; (e) peer reviewing to assess the possible 
unintended environmental consequences of biotechnology is practised; and (f) effective 
antitrust regulation is put in place (Wright and Shih, 2010).

While  there  are  no  simple  answers  in  this  regard,  publicly  funded  research 
should maintain an explicit focus on strategic priorities for food security, including im-
proving yields and resistance of staples, improving the nutritional value of crops, facili-
tating sustainable use of natural resources and/or reducing the use of external chemical 
inputs. Innovative mechanisms designed to engage the private sector need to be explored: 
results-based performance contracts—for the development, for example, of improved seed 
or crop varieties with higher water-stress tolerance and greater responsiveness to fertiliz-
ers—granted on a competitive basis may be one means of stimulating private research. 
Patent buyouts, prizes and proportional prizes may be other means of doing so (Elliot, 
2010; Bhagwati, 2005). Use of more traditional subsidies, co-financing arrangements and 
joint ventures should also be explored, within a framework of appropriate protocols for 
maintaining the public-good nature of research products (Pardey and Beintema, 2001).10
While  it  still  needs  to  be  tested  in  agriculture,  the  2010  Advanced  Market 
Commitment mechanism for the production of vaccines, whereby donors made a large 
advance purchase at a predetermined price in order to induce participation by large phar-
maceutical  companies,  may  offer  significant  lessons  relevant  to  the  effort  to  stimulate 
private research and technological innovation for food security.11

More  generally,  building  partnerships  with  the  corporate  private  sector  is 
important,  but  in  the  specific  case  of  food  security,  Governments  and  public  research 
institutions  in  developing  countries  need  to  be  fully  involved  in  setting  the  research 
agenda, including comprehensive risk assessments and suitable regulations on the use of 
new technologies (Lipton, 2010).

Seed prices have increased by 30 per cent since 1996 when GE seeds were introduced, a price 
increase higher than that for any other input (Ervin, Glenna and Jussaume, 2010).
One of the problems connected with current associations between private companies and public 
universities is that the research products are often protected by the copyrights held by the private 
companies that have co-financed the research. 
The Governments of Canada, Italy, Norway, the Russian Federation and the United Kingdom of 
Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation signed an agreement 
with GlaxoSmithKline and Pfizer, Inc., by which the firms committed to supplying 30 million doses 
of vaccines each year for 10 years at a reduced price for developing countries, provided donors 
made additional payments for 20 per cent of the doses. See http://www.gavialliance.org/media_

Technical support and extension services

Large-scale extension 
services in agriculture are 
important for effective 
technological adaptation

… with special attention  
to female farmers

The second pillar of an effective strategy for promoting education, science and technol-
ogy in agriculture is the dissemination of information and technology, which during the 
green revolution, was mainly carried out by agricultural extension workers. In the current 
context, a larger number of actors (civil society organizations, the private sector, farmers 
and multilateral organizations) contribute towards this end.

A survey conducted by the Global Conference on Agricultural Research for 
Development (GCARD) estimates that about one half billion agricultural extension work-
ers exist globally, most of them being public workers. Although the number appears large, 
the general perception is that it is inadequate, especially when measured against the needs 
of small-scale farm holders who, for the most part, have been deprived of the services of 
such workers (Lele and others, 2010). Agricultural extension workers who have no particu-
lar interest in promoting the use of commercial products are still an important vehicle for 
the transmission of knowledge, information and training for small farm holders, provided 
that they have adequate training themselves, a clear mandate and appropriate incentives 
to perform their job.

Exclusion of women from technical support needs to be explicitly addressed. 
In Africa, women receive 7 per cent of agricultural extension services and less than 10 per 
cent of credit offered to small-scale farm holders.12 Moreover, inasmuch as educational 
curricula tend to exclude topics with particular relevance to women (such as nutrition, 
sanitation, hygiene, gender-specific tools and management), gender analysis and targeted 
initiatives must be incorporated in agricultural education, research and extension services 
(Davis and others, 2007).

In Ethiopia and Mozambique, for example, inadequate resources for expand-
ing research and training facilities and retaining faculty members have compromised the 
quality of education received by students. Graduate education is more conceptual in nature 
than managerial and practically oriented and has thus failed to nurture innovative capac-
ity among farmers in the range of services required to improve production and marketing, 
including their capacity for collective action (ibid.).

In India, a country with a long tradition of promoting agricultural R&D, Hall 
and others (1998) found little interaction occurring between scientists and extension service 
providers, or between production and post-harvest scientists. Institutional segregation by 
discipline and highly centralized management obscure the relevance of technical support to 
farmers and the building of partnerships among public agricultural R&D institutions, the 
private sector, farmer associations and civil society organizations. Scientists and extension 
service workers often have fairly fragmented perspectives on production and marketing and 
have been unable to make practical use of research findings and knowledge.

A longer-term commitment to providing adequate funding for public research 
and training needs to be accompanied by a new approach to technical education—one that 
is more practical in nature and oriented towards problem-solving and decision-making, 
and  with  greater  capacity  to  involve  farmers  and  civil  society  organizations  in  finding 
interdisciplinary and creative solutions to new problems.

Formal and informal 
education and peer 
learning are essential 
for strengthening the 
innovative capacity of 
farmers

Basic education and peer learning

The third pillar of an effective sustainable agricultural innovation system is basic education 
and adult literacy and training. The ability of farmers to innovate, learn from one another 
and  adapt  to  change  largely  depends  on  their  capacity  to  access  and  process  informa-
tion including through information and communications technology. Rapid expansion 
of quality education in rural areas, including adult literacy and training, should receive 
the highest priority in any strategy aimed at strengthening farmers’ responsive capacity to 
rapidly changing agroecological and market conditions. Flexible land management and 
the capacity to innovate in production, storage and marketing practices and techniques 
require appropriate use of information and technology as part of a continuous learning 
process (Davis and others, 2007).

More innovative mechanisms for the transmission of knowledge and training 
also need strengthening. The experience of the Farm Field Schools—operating in 87 coun-
tries—shows that innovation and flexible natural resource management can be advanced 
through farmer-to-farmer learning, with participation from formal and informal research 
institutions (see also box III.1). In-service and on-the-job training and distance education 
have also proved effective and are increasingly complementing extension services.

Beyond rural education

Education aimed at changing 
behaviour is also important 
in respect of reducing waste 
and promoting the adoption 
of sustainable diets and 
consumption practices

Education is also central to bringing about the requisite societal transformation needed 
to  ensure  food  security  and  protect  the  environment.  Formal  and  informal  education, 
extension services, advertising and information campaigns, and political and civil society 
mobilization are important means of creating more sustainable food production and con-
sumption patterns.

On the production side, farmers need to be informed and trained and stimulated 
to adopt more sustainable practices. However, the challenge of feeding a rising and increas-
ingly affluent population also requires behavioural changes in terms of consumption, includ-
ing dietary patterns. In particular, the livestock sector, which has grown rapidly to meet the 
increasing demand for meat, is a prime cause of water scarcity, pollution, land degradation 
and greenhouse gas emissions. This has prompted calls for support for vegetarian diets.13
However, the nutritional importance of animal protein, particularly in developing countries, 
and the differences, in the context of production efficiency and environmental impact, be-
tween different types of livestock,14 may warrant, instead, warnings against consumption of 
red meat and dairy products (Godfray and others, 2010b). Publicity, advocacy, education and 
even legislation can also be used to bring about ideological, cultural and behavioural changes 
so as to reduce high levels of retail and domestic food waste in the developed world.

Building new institutions that pave the way towards sustainable agriculture and 
food security by strengthening the multiple nodes of the SAIS and changing behaviours is

According to certain estimates, cattle (under intensive production) consume 114-125 litres of water 
per animal per day compared with 1.3-1.8 litres in the case of chicken; cattle require 8 kilograms 
(kg) of cereal per animal to produce 1 kg of meat compared with a 1 kg feed requirement for 
chicken (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 2006; Intergovernmental Panel 
on Climate Change, 2007b). The dairy and beef sector of the United Kingdom accounted for over 
24 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2e) of CH4 and N2O emissions in 2005, compared 
with 2 MtCO2e from the poultry sector (Radov and others, 2007).

a long-term process requiring commitment of resources, a clear vision of the overall direc-
tion of change, and capacities to adapt to a changing environment. National strategies to 
achieve food security and sustainable agriculture will help Governments ensure consistency 
in typically decentralized agricultural innovation systems, and help guide the direction of 
donor resources and private sector investments. Without this minimum framework, rural 
structural change may not occur in time to prevent irreversible human and environmental 
damage to the current food production and consumption systems.

Regional and global partnerships for food  
security and environmental sustainability

Payments for environmental 
services and better regulation 
of commodity markets 
could facilitate international 
cooperation towards food 
security and environmental 
protection

The  international  community  has  much  to  contribute  to  a  global  agenda  for  food  secu-
rity and environmental sustainability. Chapter VI examines the challenges associated with 
international cooperation in various areas. In the case of agriculture and sustainable land 
management, delivering on the financial pledges made in the aftermath of the food crisis of 
2007-2008 would constitute a good down payment on realizing the commitment to the goal 
of eradicating hunger. Other areas where international action can be expected include:

•	

•	

•	

•	

Reform of agricultural subsidies in OECD countries, including subsidies to 
biofuels,  and  support  to  new-generation  biofuels  to  reduce  the  diversion  of 
agricultural land use from food production.
Increased international investment in agricultural R&D for food security with 
private sector participation in development. Adequate funding for the effective 
functioning of CGIAR during the green revolution was critical to facilitating 
rapid innovation through proactive adaptation and dissemination, often with 
supportive  and  facilitative  (subsidized)  public  provisioning  of  infrastructure 
and  other  needed  inputs.  Reconstituting  the  global,  regional  and  national 
capacities for agricultural R&D with international financial support can result 
in the generation of a rapid increase in agricultural productivity.
New financing mechanisms to expand payments to small farm holders in de-
veloping countries for environmental services (PES) that help protect natural 
resources,  to  preserve  biodiversity  and  to  increase  carbon  sequestration  in 
agriculture and forestry.
Elimination of non-tariff barriers to food trade which prevent the expansion of 
markets to include small-scale producers in developing countries.
Adoption of green/ecological footprint standards.
Effective regulation of commodity futures markets to avert speculation with 
food prices.
In the very short term, preventing export bans on food crops and panic buying 
in response to weather-related catastrophes would help to reduce large price spikes. In ad-
dition, mechanisms to protect vulnerable populations utilizing safety nets and food assist-
ance are necessary in order to reduce the impact of increasing food prices. Building global 
grain reserves may be an option in responding to food emergencies but the management 
and deployment of assistance require closer scrutiny so as to ensure an effective emergency 
response and to avert longer-term negative impacts on local food production systems.

Reducing human harm  
from natural hazards

Summary
The frequency of natural disasters, especially in the form of floods and storms, has quintupled 
over the past 40 years, the elevated disaster risk being partly due to the effects of climate change. 
Developing countries bear a higher share of the adverse consequences of that increased risk. 
Heightened  disaster  risk  associated  with  poor  management  of  the  natural  environment  and 
human-induced  climate  change  requires  a  long-term  approach  to  reducing  risk  from  natural 
events.   An integrated and preventive framework embedded in national development strategies 
would be most effective. 
Existing  technologies  and  knowledge  systems—including  those  embodied  in  traditional  and 
indigenous  knowledge—are  up  to  the  tasks  of  reducing  disaster  risk  and  adapting  to  climate 
change. The bottleneck in their application to the local context lies in the cost of adaptation and 
investment, given other competing public priorities. To ensure that disaster risk management is 
accorded the appropriate attention, disaster reduction and adaptation programmes must be an 
integral part of national development strategies. 

Introduction

In the 1970s, about 69 natural disasters were recorded worldwide every year. By the 2000s, 
this average had increased to 350 per year. Changes in the natural environment, owing 
in part to global warming, have elevated disaster risk and in consequence adaptation to 
those changes is testing human ingenuity. Developing countries tend to bear a dispropor-
tionate share of the adverse consequences of increased disaster risk since multiple vulner-
abilities associated with lower levels of development and inadequate resources hinder them 
from more rapidly building up resilient infrastructure and knowledge capacities for risk 
reduction.

Susceptibility to harm is highly correlated with inequities in respect of the level 
of development and the incidence of poverty. Overcoming those challenges within an envi-
ronmentally constrained world means that technological transformation for green growth 
must be swift and inclusive. The uncertain availability of key inputs for economic growth 
and life survival such as renewable energy and water makes the utilization of technologies 
for disaster risk reduction and sustainable development more urgent. Putting an end to 
these inequities will require the inclusion of the appropriate technological content in the 
adaptation strategies and livelihood sphere of those who are poor and most vulnerable.

The present chapter assesses strategic options for facilitating and realizing the 
technological transformation needed to adapt to and reduce disaster risk, and to create the 
domestic capacity to respond swiftly and effectively to the increased adverse impacts of 
natural hazards on livelihoods and the likelihood of catastrophic events.

Multidimensional impacts of natural disasters

As noted above, the number of natural disasters has quintupled over the past 40 years. 
Figure IV.1 depicts this trend for floods, storms, droughts, extreme temperatures, earth-
quakes, volcanoes, slides and wildfires. By far most of the increase can be accounted for 
by the greater incidence of hydro-meteorological disasters (floods, storms, droughts and 
extreme temperatures), which are associated with climate change. Further, the number of 
prolonged droughts has tripled.

The World Economic and Social Survey 2008 (United Nations, 2008b, p. 81) 
stressed that, although geologic disasters can inflict severe damage, hydro-meteorological 
disasters “pose a greater threat of becoming large-scale (catastrophic) disasters and also 
account for much of the rising trend of reported disasters in recent decades”.

In many countries and regions, the weather has become more erratic and often 
there have been spells of extreme temperatures. Some areas have been hit by much more 
intense rainfall in recent decades, while others have seen their dry seasons turn into pro-
longed droughts. Many countries regularly encounter both manifestations of these forces 
of nature: heavy storms and rainfall, and severe droughts.

remained approximately constant throughout the 35-year period 1970-2004, hurricanes 
and storms in the strongest categories (4 and 5) have almost doubled in number in all 
ocean basins (Webster and others, 2005). The number of droughts that lasted from one to 
two years or longer tripled between 1970-1979 and 2000-2009.

Mapping disaster risks

There has been a long-term declining trend in the average number of persons killed per 
disaster, leaving the average number of deaths per year from disasters more or less constant. 
At the same time, however, the increased frequency of natural disasters has contributed to 
a large increase in the number of persons affected by disasters and in the estimated costs 
of the damages incurred (figure IV.2). Damages have averaged $88 billion per year since 
2000, compared with an average of $12 billion in the 1970s. While disasters have become 
less life-threatening, they have become more damaging to the livelihoods and well-being 
of the communities hit.

The human cost measured in terms of both the number of persons affected 
and the loss of human lives is significantly higher in developing countries, albeit with 
regional differences. According to figure IV.3, which shows the greater vulnerability of the 
populations of developing countries, the number of affected people (injured and homeless) 
is highest in developing Asia, although large parts of Africa and Latin America also show 
high degrees of impact. The forces of nature have also affected large numbers of persons 
per event in developed countries (most notably Australia and Spain), despite their gener-
ally greater resilience.

While all regions are exposed to natural hazards, it is in developing regions 
that  most  disasters  (comprising  droughts,  earthquakes,  extreme  temperatures,  floods, 
slides, storms, volcanoes and wildfires) tend to occur (table IV.1). Also, by far most deaths, 
injuries and cases of homelessness (over 95 per cent) result from natural disasters in de-
veloping regions. The average number of persons killed per 100,000 inhabitants is five 
times higher in developing than in developed regions. Although the divergence between 
developing and developed regions continues when considering least developed countries 
and the group of small island developing States, the proportions vary. The number killed 
per 100,000 in least developed countries is 12 times higher than in developed regions 
and in small island developing States, more than 2½ times higher. Further, the number 
affected per 100,000 in least developed countries is 16 times higher than in developed 
regions and in small island developing States, about 10 times higher. The fact that the 
incidence of affected persons is somewhat below the developing-country average can be 
explained by the fact that many least developed countries and small island developing 
States tend to be less densely populated. Australia and New Zealand are exceptions owing 
to the higher incidence of climatic events in those countries, which have been affected by 
extreme temperatures, storms and floods, droughts and wildfires, as well as earthquakes, 
over the last 20 years.

Is climate change to blame?

The number of climate-related disasters has grown at an accelerating rate since the 1950s, 
while geophysical disasters have followed a relatively stable upward trend, as was shown in 
figure IV.1. As this suggests the existence of a driver of increasing climate-related disaster 
events, researchers have tried through complex models to quantify to what extent weather 
shocks are related to climate change. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 
(IPCC) (2007a) warns, however, that results are often not conclusive, since climate models 
are constantly being updated and improved. The model-based analyses available to date 
suggest that climate change will result in warmer or fewer cold nights, warmer days and 
more occurrences of hot days over most land areas. The number of spells of warm weather 
and heatwaves, as well as the frequency and duration of droughts, will likely increase. 
This will result in decreased agricultural yields in most warm areas, where the majority of 
developing countries are located, and will have adverse effects on the availability and qual-
ity of groundwater. Climate change will also increase the frequency of heavy precipitation 
in most areas as well as the number of intense tropical cyclones in areas where they are 
at  present  occurring.  Using  model  simulations,  it  has  been  estimated  that  each  rise  in 
tropical sea surface temperature by 1° C will increase the speed of hurricane surface winds 
by between 1 and 8 per cent and the degree of core rainfall by between 6 and 18 per cent 
(United States Climate Change Science Program, 2008).

For  many  developing  countries,  environmental  constraints  and  shocks  are 
already part of a vicious cycle, which keep them trapped at a low level of income, un-
dermines their resource base and restricts their ability to protect themselves from future 
shocks (United Nations, 2008b; 2009). While developing countries will need to take these

adverse effects into account, they can also respond to them as offering an opportunity to 
make changes in living arrangements, build infrastructure that can absorb labour, and use 
more advanced technology for adaptation to and reduction of disaster risk.

Unequal impacts on livelihoods

Settlements of low-income 
people are often the most 
vulnerable

Unchecked climate change 
threatens to reduce 
agricultural yields and 
increase the number of 
malnourished children  
by 2050

A greater frequency of 
extreme temperatures 
will have devastating 
consequences

Developing regions bear the brunt of the adverse impacts of natural hazards (United Nations, 
2008b; 2009). Droughts in sub-Saharan Africa and flooding in parts of Asia have already 
ravaged thousands of livelihoods, while heat spells have increased the risk of water scarcity 
in some countries. Also, urban development tends to increase environmental pressures that 
lead to disasters such as flooding, and settlements of low-income people are often the most 
vulnerable in this regard. Affluent groups—whether in developing countries or not—are 
often in a better position to withstand flooding, as the experience of the 2005 hurricane 
Katrina in New Orleans demonstrates (McGranahan, Balk and Anderson, 2007).

Climate  change  has  been  associated  with  shifted  growing  seasons,  threat-
ened  water  sources  and  exacerbated  food  shortages.  Unchecked  climate  change  would 
reduce agricultural yields which, according to one estimate, could in turn cause a 20 per 
cent increase in the number of malnourished children by 2050 (Food and Agriculture 
Organization of the United Nations, 2009b). The adverse impacts on food production 
and nutrition would have ripple effects directly affecting the employment, income and 
livelihoods of both poor small farmers and urban-dwellers. In Bangladesh, for instance, 
the overflow of seawater has affected the livelihoods of fishermen, since rivers are now con-
taminated and fish banks have been decimated. By 2050, 70 million people in Bangladesh 
could be affected annually by climate change.

The impacts of the symptoms of climate change have different dimensions. A 
greater frequency of extreme temperatures, for example, can have devastating consequences. 
In the summer of 2010, the Russian Federation faced the worst heatwave in its history, which 
caused 56,000 fatalities and left 100,000 homeless and over 500,000 hectares of forests 
destroyed by fires. In general, longer and drier seasons in Argentina, Canada, the Russian 
Federation, Ukraine and the United States of America have severely damaged harvests.

Similarly, the range of health risks from climate change and natural disasters is 
likely to be considerable, with all parts of the globe affected, as the unprecedented number 
of deaths in Europe from recent heatwaves has demonstrated. However, health vulner-
ability is very closely linked to other vulnerabilities, with the burden of climate-sensitive 
diseases imposed overwhelmingly on the poorest populations which also experienced the 
lowest coverage by health services. In fact, the people most vulnerable to climate change 
are those who have not been well protected by health sector interventions in the past. 
Meanwhile, it is not variation in the extent of climate change but in the magnitude of 
pre-existing health problems that has had the greatest influence on impacts in different 
regions. A recent assessment by the World Health Organization (WHO) (2009) estimates 
that the burden of disease imposed through the modest warming that has occurred since 
the 1970s is causing about 150,000 additional deaths annually in low-income countries 
from four climate-sensitive health outcomes—malnutrition, diarrhoeal disease and ma-
laria. These additional deaths are concentrated in already vulnerable population groups; 
for instance, 90 per cent of the burden of malaria and diarrhoea, and almost all of the 
burden of diseases associated with undernutrition, are borne by children aged 5 years or 
under  (Campbell-Lendrum,  2009;  United  Nations,  2009).  Over  the  long  term,  higher 
temperatures will induce excessive levels of ozone and other air pollutants that provoke 

Reducing human harm from natural hazards

cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, and of pollen and other aero-allergens that trigger 
asthma, with the poor and the elderly being hardest hit (Beggs, 2004).

As many of the most important infectious diseases are highly sensitive to both 
temperature  and  precipitation  conditions,  higher  temperatures  will  increase  the  rates  of 
survival and replication of bacterial contaminants of food and water sources, which are 
responsible for imposing a large proportion of the burden of diarrhoeal disease, particu-
larly in poor countries. Already, per capita mortality rates from vector-borne diseases are 
almost  300  times  greater  in  developing  regions  than  in  developed  ones  (World  Health 
Organization, 2009). The situation creates a double burden for women, who can be dis-
criminated against based on their diseases-related afflictions (United Nations Children’s 
Fund, 2008; UN Women Watch, 2011).

Flooding may pose additional risks to human health. In Bangladesh, where 
arsenic contamination of groundwater is heavy, flooding increases the rate of exposure 
among rural populations. Long-term exposure to arsenic has deleterious health effects, 
including the increased incidence of certain cancers.

The  most  immediate  effect  of  hydro-meteorological  hazards  on  health  and 
well-being is likely to be a function of the availability of water. It is estimated that one 
quarter  of  the  population  in  Africa  (about  200  million  people)  experience  water  stress 
(Ludi,  2009).  Increasing  temperatures  and  more  variable  precipitation  are  expected  to 
reduce  the  availability  of  freshwater,  making  it  more  difficult  to  fulfil  basic  needs  for 
drinking, cooking and washing. Meanwhile, a greater incidence of flooding, stemming, 
inter alia, from more intense precipitation and from sea-level rise in lower coastal zones, 
will further contaminate freshwater supplies, thereby further increasing water scarcity.

The presence of large human populations in those zones has further increased 
the vulnerability of the coastal ecosystems. Two thirds of all cities worldwide with a popu-
lation of more than 5 million are located within coastal areas with an elevation of less than 
10 metres. Because of growing urban development and increased extraction of ground-
water, among other factors, land has sunk in some places. The territory around Tianjin 
in China, for example, has been sinking at the rate of about five centimetres per year. In 
cities located in large river deltas, land areas have been disappearing because of sediment 
deposition. In the absence of added protection, lower land levels enhance the vulnerability 
to more frequent flooding, coastal erosion and the immersion of salt in groundwater.

Natural hazards will thus have varying impacts on communities depending 
on the nature of the hazard and the location, resilience of infrastructure and preparedness 
of the population in affected areas. Table IV.2 summarizes some of the possible effects of 
increased climate-related natural disaster risks.

Enhanced risk of “extreme” disruptions?

Recent research confirms that major disruptions in the ecosystem, often referred to as 
“extreme  events”,  have  become  more  likely.  Such  events  could  already  be  occurring  in 
the area of biodiversity (as evidenced by rapid extinction of species) and may be close to 
affecting fisheries and some water systems (Rockström and others, 2009).

The increased likelihood of extreme events led major stakeholders to reassess 
current climate change adaptation strategies through the preparation of a special report 
on the theme (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2009). It is argued therein 
that  “gradual  and  non-linear  change  to  ecosystems  and  natural  resources  and  increas-
ing vulnerability further increases the consequences of extreme weather events” (p. 2). At 
the current global average temperature, the likelihood of extreme events has increased,

and the threat of large-scale discontinuities such as “changes in the ocean conveyor-belt 
heat-distribution system or catastrophic thawing of the Arctic leading to massive releases 
of methane” grows if global warming leads to an average temperature rise of more than 
2° C above pre-industrial levels. In particular, the risks of large sea-level rise and extreme 
weather events are currently larger than previously thought (World Bank, 2010a).

Extreme events are more likely to be cross-border, with serious damage being 
inflicted on different sectors of the economies affected. The 2004 tsunami in Asia and 2011 
earthquake in Japan are recent reminders that the damages and losses resulting from dis-
asters can be staggering, if the location and the existing level of resilience of the social and 
economic infrastructures renders the areas affected particularly vulnerable. Total damages 
and losses incurred by Indonesia were more pronounced in the social sector (health, educa-
tion and housing), while in Sri Lanka it was the productive sectors (fisheries, industry and 
commerce, tourism and agriculture) that suffered more (Birkmann and others, 2010b).

There are uncertainties associated with predictions of possible disaster scenarios, 
which are often coloured by their own assumptions about future weather, degrees of global 
warming and tipping points (Gillett and others, 2011). In cases where the causes of the increas-
ing risk of large disasters and catastrophes are sufficiently understood, shifts in individual and 
social behaviour and application of known technologies to reduce their impact are urgent.

Approaches to disaster risk reduction 
and climate change adaptation
Existing incremental approaches

Fragmented actions 
could, at worst, cause new 
problems or aggravate 
existing ones…

…including a number of 
closely interlinked and 
compounding threats 
to social and economic 
security

Despite imminent threats, disaster risk management and adaptation to climate change 
in developed and developing countries alike have not been mainstreamed into broader 
decision-making processes (Adger and others, 2003; Huq and Reid, 2004). The challenge 
tends to be addressed by adding an “extra layer” to existing policy design and implementa-
tion mechanisms rather than by adjusting the original design so as to confront climate 
change in a more integrated way (O’Brien and others, 2008). Equating adaptation meas-
ures with emergency relief and placing the challenge within a framework of reliance on 
requests for donor support (a frequent approach) has not helped, having in fact given rise 
to an often bifurcated outlook, based on which efforts either focus on responses to the 
impacts of climate change (through coping measures) or seek to reduce exposure through 
climate-proofing existing projects and activities, particularly in the context of disaster risk 
management. While these two approaches share a common goal, there is a real danger that 
the perspectives underlying coping and proofing pull in different policy directions and 
that fragmented actions will end up, at best, creating a partial solution to problems and, at 
worst, causing new problems or aggravating existing ones (Sanchez-Rodriguez, Fragkias 
and Solecki, 2008).

As discussed in World Economic and Social Surveys 2008 and 2009 (United 
Nations, 2008b; 2009), there is indeed a real danger, already apparent in the response to 
natural disasters, that underlying structural causes of vulnerability and maladaptation will 
be ignored, including a number of closely interlinked and compounding threats to social 
and economic security.

Recent efforts to forge a more consistent approach to the adaptation challenge 
and weather shocks stress the central role of market incentives (Organization for Economic 
Cooperation and Development, 2008). These efforts usefully highlight the methodologi-
cal challenge inherent in evaluating the costs and benefits of disaster risk reduction and 
adaptation to climate change, point to a role for positive incentives, and help expand the 
scope for more efficient coping and risk-reduction strategies.

However, such an approach tends to perceive the challenge in terms of a series 
of  discrete  and  unconnected  threats  which  can  be  addressed  through  incremental  im-
provements made to existing arrangements, thereby ignoring the large-scale investments 
and integrated policy efforts that are likely to be called for in response to climate-related 
threats.

The need for an integrated approach

The alternative approach perceives adaptation in terms of building resilience with respect 
to climatic shocks and hazards by realizing higher levels of socio-economic development 
so as to provide threatened communities and countries with the requisite social and eco-
nomic buffers. As elaborated in World Economic and Social Surveys 2008 and 2009 (United 
Nations, 2008b; 2009), such an approach would contribute to meeting the larger develop-
ment challenge of overcoming a series of interrelated socio-economic vulnerabilities.

The Hyogo Framework 
for Action supports the 
integration of climate 
change adaptation and 
disaster risk reduction into 
national development 
strategies

Disaster risk reduction strategies are now moving increasingly in this direc-
tion. Until 2005, those strategies had dealt with the adverse effects of natural hazards 
without explicitly recognizing the impact of climate change. Nevertheless, this experience 
allowed the accumulation of invaluable knowledge on how to cope with and reduce the 
adverse impact of disasters. As noted above, for most countries and at different income 
levels, a significant reduction of fatalities per disaster has been observed during the last 
two decades. However, the increased incidence of climatic disasters, that is, those linked 
to hydro-meteorological hazards, has required a reconsideration of disaster risk reduction 
strategies. Within the Hyogo Framework for Action 2005-2015: Building the Resilience 
of Nations and Communities to Disasters,1 168 Governments agreed to integrate climate 
change adaptation and disaster risk reduction by: (a) identifying climate-related disaster 
risks; (b) designing specific risk reduction measures; and (c) improving the use of climate 
risk information (para. 19 (c)). This approach focuses on responding effectively to more 
frequent and intense hydro-meteorological hazards and on the need to mainstream risk 
reduction into national development strategies.

A significant strain in the thinking on disaster risk reduction was focused on 
policy responses to volcanic eruptions, tsunamis and earthquakes. Climate change adapta-
tion strategies, on the other hand, focus on increased resilience to hydro-meteorological 
hazards, with emphasis on finding a sustainable and preventive approach to disaster risk 
reduction. With greater consideration given to climatic hazards caused by human activity, 
disaster risk reduction strategies are becoming more long-term in perspective and more 
oriented towards prevention of disasters through investing in sustainable development.

Risk, uncertainty and catastrophes

Even where risks can be 
quantified, the impact of 
interactions among these 
risks could be uncertain

In economics a key distinction is made between the concept of risk and that of uncertainty. 
In the present context, risk would apply to a situation where the probability and impact of 
an adverse event “can be inferred from past behaviour of the economy and the ecosystem” 
(Ocampo, 2011b, p. 19). Risk would then apply to a situation involving the likelihood of 
damages caused by hurricanes and tropical storms in certain parts of the world. Because 
the expected costs of such risks are quantifiable to a certain degree, resources can be set 
aside to insure against the potential damage.

Uncertainty is a condition in which the probability and scale of adverse events 
cannot be inferred from past information. The uncertainty can arise with respect to the 
category of “known unknowns”; in this instance, awareness can exist concerning the pos-
sibility of a catastrophic event, such as a natural disaster, but with few clues regarding 
whether such a disaster could set in motion irreversible processes beyond certain thresh-
olds. This form of uncertainty is incorporated, for instance, in some future climate change 
scenarios. Yet, even where risks can be quantified, the impact of interactions among these 
risks could be uncertain. In this regard, Rockström and others (2010) suggest that one 
type of uncertainty stems from “what human-induced surprises could be triggered, even 
though several of the risks have been identified [such as the] abrupt change in the African 
and Indian monsoons, accelerated melting of glaciers, abrupt savannization of rainforests 
[and the observed] abrupt collapse of the Arctic summer ice in 2007” (p. 34).

When the issue is one of risk, in particular in matters of diseases and other 
health challenges, it is incumbent on societies to invest in and set aside resources substan-
tial enough to deal with the calculated impact of disasters and other threats to human

costs of selected hazards 
would be advisable

life. When the risk and its distribution across the population can be calculated actuarially, 
private insurance could be utilized to raise the needed resources. Even when risks are well 
quantified, an adequate level of public investment is required to induce private investor 
participation, in, for example, general public health and seasonal flood control. When the 
existing domestic technology is not adequate for dealing with those risks, public authori-
ties can either import it or invest in its development. Cost-benefit calculations can provide 
guidance on the level of public funding required, suitable financing modalities, and the 
manner in which risks are to be incorporated in national development strategies.

However, when the threat belongs to the category of uncertain events, guid-
ance will be limited on probability of impact and scale of the threat. The potential cost of 
extreme events raises the question how much a country can accomplish through preventive 
strategies  and  building  resilience.  Nevertheless,  incorporating  those  threats  in  national 
planning is appropriate. Undertaking detailed studies on the likelihood of extreme events 
and the potential costs for selected hazards might also be considered by national authori-
ties. The ferocity of onslaught of some recent natural hazards suggests that uncertainty in 
connection with natural events is quite pervasive and that building climate-proof infra-
structure would not eliminate all risk.

Given the likelihood of extreme events, three sets of critical questions need 
to be posed when addressing the investment and technological challenges of providing 
protection:

•	

•	

•	

What kind of infrastructure would be resilient and how much should be in-
vested in such infrastructure? Should precautions be taken to eliminate even the 
smallest possibility of a ruinous catastrophe? How should the costs and benefits 
of the necessary investments for present and future generations be weighed? In 
some cases, a more pointed question could be asked, namely, whether provid-
ing greater resilience is feasible at all in the case, for example, of some small 
island developing States and hence whether other “adaptation strategies” might 
be needed, such as massive evacuation of threatened populations;
What kinds of research and development need to be promoted to achieve bet-
ter protection against natural disasters, through the devising of better techno-
logical solutions in the area of climate-proofing of infrastructure and better 
management of the natural environment?
How could these considerations be aligned with broader national sustainable 
development strategies and global disaster reduction strategies?

The road to technological transformation

Societies seeking to achieve the overall objective of reducing the impact of disaster risk are 
confronted with difficult choices as regards investment and technology policy. Because 
resources are finite, the coverage of disaster reduction is necessarily finite. The fact that 
the geographical context, the historical record in respect of disasters and projected climate 
change impacts vary from country to country implies that the nature and the scale of 
extreme events will vary from country to country as well. Strategy choices will be more 
limited in countries like the small island developing States that are more vulnerable to 
extreme  events.  Countries,  operating  within  their  limits,  will  eventually  call  on  other 
countries for assistance when the scale of an actual disaster overwhelms domestic resources 
that can be devoted to disaster response and prevention.

112

World Economic and Social Survey 2011

While  there  are  no  general  strategies  for  confronting  these  issues,  national 
development  strategies  can  identify  explicitly  the  natural  hazards  that  impose  risks  on 
projected development results and, on that basis, establish a prioritization of risks that 
must  be  addressed  by  investment  and  technology  development  programmes.  National 
Governments can also identify the natural hazards that are regional in nature and then 
undertake to facilitate regional investment strategies.

Harnessing local technologies

For many poor countries, the strategic challenge is to combine the best local knowledge 
on adaptation with the expertise of qualified professionals and practitioners. The United 
Nations  Framework  Convention  on  Climate  Change  (2006)  underlines  that  “(m)ost 
methods of adaptation involve some form of technology—which in the broadest sense 
includes not just materials or equipment but also diverse forms of knowledge” (preface). 
The Cancun Adaptation Framework (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
Change,  2011,  decision  1/CP.16,  sect.  II)  stresses  that  adaptation  “should  be  based  on 
and guided by the best available science and, as appropriate, traditional and indigenous 
knowledge, with a view to integrating adaptation into relevant social, economic and envi-
ronmental policies and actions” (para. 12).

Through use of local knowledge, some communities have been able to cope 
with floods by building houses on stilts and cultivating floating vegetable plots, while re-
mote satellite sensing has been able to provide more accurate weather forecasts for flood 
prevention. Such local action is vital. The visionary project of green integrated urban plan-
ning in Curitiba (Brazil) created a balance between promoting green economic growth and 
building resilience to more intense and frequent natural hazards, including floods, extreme 
temperatures and population density, and developing green areas (box IV.1). In Ho Chi 
Minh City (Viet Nam), where communities have been involved in mangrove rehabilitation, 
local action has been essential for effective adaptation (see below and annex IV.1).

Smart and integrated urban planning in Curitiba, Brazil

While the population of Curitiba grew from 361,000 in 1960 to 1,828,000 in 2008, it did not experience 
the typical concomitants of expansion, namely, congestion, pollution and reduction of public space. 
For instance, the city’s green area expanded from 1 square kilometre to over 50 square kilometres 
per person between 1970 and 2008, despite the fact that its population density increased threefold 
in the same period.

One of the key choices of urban planning had been growth in a “radial linear-branching 
pattern”,  which  served  to  enhance  green  areas  and  encouraged,  through  a  combination  of  land-
use zoning and provision of public transport infrastructure, the diversion of traffic away from the 
city centre, the development of climate-resilient housing, and the location of services and industries 
along the radial axes.

By turning areas vulnerable to flooding into parks and creating artificial lakes to hold 
floodwaters, Curitiba has managed to address its potentially costly flooding problem. The cost of this 
strategy, including the relocation costs of slum-dwellers, is estimated to be five times less than that 
of building concrete canals. Among other results the property values of neighbouring areas appreci-
ated and tax revenues increased.

Curitiba has also promoted waste management infrastructure and public awareness on 
waste separation and recycling. With 70 per cent of the city’s residents actively recycling, 13 per cent 
of solid waste is recycled in Curitiba, compared with only 1 per cent in São Paulo.

For many poor countries, 
the strategic challenge is 
to combine the best local 
knowledge on adaptation 
with advanced expertise

Institutional gaps

The Cancun Adaptation Framework reaffirmed the institutional focus by stressing that 
“adaptation  …  requires  appropriate  institutional  arrangements  to  enhance  adaptation 
action  and  support”  (para.  2  (b)).  One  dimension  of  such  arrangements  would  be  the 
mainstreaming  by  Governments  of  investments  in  disaster  risk  reduction  research  and 
education into science, technology and production sector policies, thereby making them 
part of green national innovation systems, as discussed further in chapter V.

Societies also have to overcome political resistance to deployment of technolo-
gies on location. Harnessing the energies of different stakeholders with diverse interests 
during the process of creating a sustainable path of development is not an easy task for 
any Government. In 2005, the integration of different interests, ideas and activities into a 
three-year project to restore the Cheonggyecheon Stream in Seoul required often lengthy 
dialogues and negotiations. Under the leadership of the mayor, the city’s political, business 
and residential communities found a way to coordinate their views on balanced urban 
growth and sustainable development. The rehabilitation of the local streams and improve-
ments in water systems have enhanced resilience to floods.

The scope of technological transformation

The increased incidence of disasters and the higher likelihood of extreme events make 
investment in adaptation urgent. For the poorest countries, international cooperation will 
require emphasis on adaptation rather than on mitigation. For many developing countries, 
the demands of coping with the additional burdens of climate change will exceed domestic 
resources and require external support. In those countries, investment and technological 
choices will need to focus on addressing the most immediate hazards.

Reducing disaster risk in a sustainable manner will entail changes in the design of 
settlements and infrastructure, including roads, rail systems and power plants. Investments 
in technologies for adaptation must result in the installation of resilient infrastructures along 
with the creation of a diversified economy within the context of sustainable national devel-
opment strategies (United Nations, 2008b; 2009).2 Countries need to prepare a detailed 
assessment of their vulnerabilities, and of possible impacts of disasters, to establish priorities 
in respect of their responses. For example, the Federal Service for Hydrometeorology and 
Environmental  Monitoring  of  the  Russian  Federation  prepared  impact  indices  for  infra-
structure  depending  on  the  frequency,  intensity  and  duration  of  extreme  weather  events 
and climate volatility. In Siberia, as the level of risk to infrastructure built on permafrost 
has become increasingly unacceptable (owing to the reduction in the bearing capacity of 
permafrost soils in response to warmer weather), new building techniques are necessary to 
upgrade the infrastructure (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, 
Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice, 2010).

Existing technologies and knowledge systems  
for adaptation and disaster prevention

Technologies and knowledge systems for adaptation and disaster risk reduction are diverse 
and complex. Table IV.3 presents a typology of technology and knowledge systems for 
adaptation to and reduction of the adverse impacts of natural hazards.

World Economic and Social Survey 2011

Most disaster reduction 
efforts can rely on 
known technologies and 
indigenous knowledge

Technology policies in support of adaptation and disaster risk reduction can, 
based on their dimensions, be classified according to three categories: (a) infrastructure, 
(b) regulation and (c) management. High-level storm sewers and flood-proofing of new 
buildings, for example, come under infrastructure investment. New standards for water-
use efficiency and improvement of building codes are examples of regulatory measures: 
Saint Lucia, for example, has revised its building codes so as to effect reduction in the 
adverse impacts of hurricanes, floods and extreme temperatures. The protection of man-
grove forests, resettlement and green urban planning are examples of measures related to 
improving management expertise.

As indicated in table IV.3, the building of floating communities, water plazas 
and  coastal  defence  structures  can  be  useful  for  tackling  seawater-level  rise  as  well  as 
floods. Banning new buildings in high-risk zones can be useful for preventing the adverse 
impacts  of  storms  and  floods.  Similarly,  training  to  increase  awareness  of  heat-related 
stress can be applied to reducing the impacts of droughts as well as heatwaves. The United 
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, Subsidiary Body for Scientific and 
Technological Advice (2010) notes that a rainwater harvesting system for the Caribbean 
Insular Area of Colombia, which has been effective in reducing pressure on the island 
aquifers,  is  also  being  used  in  the  Plurinational  State  of  Bolivia  to  reduce  the  adverse 
impact of droughts on the livelihoods of Aymara farmers.

From a consideration of the entries in the table, one concludes that the ac-
tions  required  for  adaptation  can  rely  heavily  on  known  technologies  and  indigenous 
knowledge. The bigger challenge is to put into place the required technical capabilities 
and managerial skills to build dykes, improve construction of low-income housing, es-
tablish and enforce rules and regulations for water use, establish monitoring and early 
warning systems, and improve preparedness for emergencies and evacuation, all of which 
constitute key interventions for reducing disaster risk. Enhancing human resources in 
these areas is critical. Investments in disaster responses—including those that entail the 
expansion of infrastructure and basic services, which can have strong development im-
pacts in the poorest countries—must be included in public sector planning. However, the 
set of disaster risk reduction projects does not constitute a development strategy. There 
are “hard choices” regarding how much of a country’s limited investment resources can 
be devoted to these projects that have still to be made.

The scale of the 
required technological 
transformation will vary 
from context to context

Technology gaps to be bridged

As the scale of the required technological transformation will vary from context to context 
as a function of the degree of disaster risk, the adaptation technologies available, and the 
kinds of adaptation and disaster risk reduction strategies that countries have already put in 
place, the following questions will have to be asked: What is the degree of disaster risk for 
different countries? What are the actual adaptation technologies and knowledge systems 
in use? Which technological gaps should still be overcome? The choices to be made based 
on the answers must reflect the constraints on financial resources faced by many develop-
ing countries.

Although discussed in the relevant literature, not all of the existing adapta-
tion technologies presented in the table have been widely used or integrated into ongoing 
projects. In fact, many of them have been implemented only in particular contexts and 
on differing scales. Annex IV.1 describes 25 ongoing adaptation projects selected from a 

Reducing human harm from natural hazards

117

databank of 135 (some of them including technological elements) operated in 70 coun-
tries.3 Over 75 per cent of all projects tend to focus on the rural sector, attesting to what 
Birkmann and von Teichman (2010) have underscored, namely, that, in general, fewer 
adaptation strategies have been formulated for urban areas. The annex specifies the main 
types of disasters to which countries are subject, the kind of adaptation technologies being 
used, and the scale at which these are implemented.

About  one  third  of  all  projects  in  the  databank  use  technological  strategies, 
often in combination with other components such as infrastructure, disaster risk reduction, 
awareness, planning and institution-building. The Grameen project, for example, combines 
technology and empowerment strategies by providing poor people with access to loans for 
home designs that are especially adapted to heavy rains and floods and, in addition, can be 
conveniently dismantled then reassembled in the face of severe flooding. Another advantage 
of this project is its national character, with the disaster-risk management sector integrated 
into the national development strategy of Bangladesh. Similarly, the Bogotá project, which 
reduces the risk of floods and landslides by improving risk-detection technology, emergency 
response, recovery finance, and awareness, uses a “cocktail” of tangible and intangible adap-
tation strategies, such as insurance, monitoring early warning systems, institution-building, 
improved infrastructure, and awareness, to achieve its objectives.

A  national-scale  project  run  by  the  Netherlands  Climate  Change  Studies 
Assistance Programme operates along similar lines, focusing on institution-building, policy 
and efficient use of resource strategies in order to improve water management in Yemen. 
These projects demonstrate that technological improvement and capacity-building activities 
are central to increasing the resilience of vulnerable people, including women, children and 
older persons. In contexts where these groups have received equal access to preventive haz-
ard management activities, the number of fatalities has been zero (World Bank, 2010a).

The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has also been active in 
facilitating technologies for climate change adaptation.4 Tessa and Kurukulasuriya (2010) 
classify  29  UNDP  country  projects  within  four  different  cateogies:  (a)  projects  imple-
mented in the areas of agriculture/food security and water resources management (mainly 
in Africa), (b) projects on infrastructure for disaster risk management (in Asia, Africa and 
the Pacific), (c) projects designed to improve ecosystem management (forest, wetland and 
coastal ecosystems) and build capacity of stakeholders and institutions and (d) projects for 
sustainable land management whose aim is to improve the technical capacity of farmers 
and pastoralists and implement sustainable land management techniques.

Multinational projects set up to enhance adaptation technologies and risk re-
duction strategies are also important. For example, with the financial support of the World 
Bank, the Caribbean Community Secretariat is engaged in safeguarding the Community’s 
coastal resources by enhancing risk communication strategies and running pilot projects 
designed to enhance the use of technology, planning methods and awareness campaigns. 
Similarly, the multinational rural project on disaster-risk management run by the non-
governmental organization ActionAid engages communities in Bangladesh, Ghana, Haiti, 
Kenya, Malawi and Nepal in activities geared to making schools in high-risk areas safer, 
thereby enabling those schools to act as models during disaster risk reduction awareness 
campaigns. Strategies centred on raising awareness, institution-building and infrastruc-
ture investment support the implementation of this project.

contributions.

Facilitating multilateral adaptation projects is critical given the multidimen-
sionality of the adverse impacts of many natural hazards. Box IV.2 offers an example of 
such  a  project,  namely,  the  partnership  between  China  and  multilateral  organizations 
established to strengthen technology-centred adaptation strategies.

China’s climate change adaptation programme  
and partnership framework

In  the  context  of  China’s  2007  National  Climate  Change  Strategy,  the  Government  of  China  and 
a number of United Nations organizationsa have signed off on a $19 million three-year joint pro-
gramme  to  coordinate  strategies  and  policies  designed  to  enable  communities  to  withstand  the 
adverse impacts of climate change. The aim is to incorporate the Strategy into policies and legal 
measures, improve local capacities and partnerships for financing technology transfer and models, 
and ensure the adaptation of vulnerable communities to climate change.

Vulnerability assessment and adaptation constitute one of the major components of 
the programme, the other two being mitigation and climate change policy. The adaptation compo-
nent addresses the areas of: (a) poverty reduction; (b) agriculture development in the Yellow River 
Basin,  including  vulnerability  assessment  and  adaptation  measures;  (c)  water  management  in  the 
Yellow River Basin, including improved groundwater monitoring in high-risk areas; (d) a strategy for 
adapting China’s health planning and practice to climate change; and (e) assessment of employment 
vulnerabilities and development of adaptation strategies.

While all of China is expected to feel the impact of climate change, poor areas are more 
vulnerable. In western China, glacial melting in the Himalayas and shifting patterns of land and water 
use for large upstream and downstream populations increase risks to livelihoods. On the south-east 
coast, rising sea levels threaten the lives of local people. Thus, vulnerability assessments and adapta-
tion measures are needed, which tie in policies devised to eradicate poverty, combat diseases and 
ensure environmental sustainability.

Changes in temperature and precipitation have significant impacts on water resources. 
Analysis of the relation between climate change and hydrologic systems has proved useful in pre-
venting water-related disasters. Owing to the increased reliance on groundwater in semi-arid and arid 
areas and the expected increased groundwater depletion and quality deterioration, assessment of 
actual changes in groundwater levels and quality and the impacts on livelihood is needed. This will 
allow for appropriate adjustment policies, including the imposing of restrictions and, where possible, 
the implementation of measures to recharge groundwater.

As climate change may lead to changes in the distribution of disease vectors and in-
creases in vector-borne diseases, China’s National Environment and Health Action Plan is focused on 
mainstreaming climate change into control policies for major health sensitive climate outcomes such as 
water stress/desertification, flooding, dust storms and smog, and on enhancing adaptive capacities.

The adverse impact of climate change on employment is still an unexplored area but 
the consequences are likely to be substantial. Major changes in crop distribution and yield would 
greatly affect people in rural areas and thus force migration into urban and industrial areas. There is a 
need for the Government and the commercial sector to assess the potential impacts on employment 
in order to formulate effective policies and responses. The focus on employment issues will comple-
ment and support other programme activities.

The programme intends to build on United Nations experience derived from past and 
ongoing projects and from grappling with high-level policy issues, to build on potential synergies 
among organizations in the United Nations family, to utilize the complementary support of other bi-
lateral and multilateral organizations, and to focus on rural areas so as to maximize environmental and 
social co-benefits. The process of consultation among United Nations institutions and the Government 
of China, identification of priorities, creation of partnerships and pursuit of implementation and moni-
toring activities will all contribute to the creation of a model for replication in other countries.

Enabling sector-level disaster-resilient 
technological change
The energy challenge

The  technological  transformation  needed  in  the  energy  sector  (see  chap.  II)  requires 
the  installation  of  new  types  of  energy  plants  and  infrastructure,  most  pervasively  in 
developing countries. As climate-proofing these facilities and related infrastructure will 
be  necessary,  developing  countries  must  build  a  domestic  capability  in  building  and 
maintaining such structures. Risk reduction specialists recommend that storage facili-
ties, factories, buildings, roads and water and sanitation infrastructures be relocated or 
reinforced against the likely impacts of longer droughts, intense precipitation, floods and 
sea-level rise. More intense and frequent floods in Albania, for example, prompted the 
Government to build smaller hydropower plants and larger water channels. By delivering 
energy more efficiently, these plants have the potential to open up avenues for sustainable 
development.

Water and sanitation

The need to climate-proof 
clean energy plants and 
infrastructure should not be 
neglected

The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (2006) has discussed 
the inclusive framework for water management referred to as integrated water resource 
management (IWRM). This approach recognizes that water is a finite resource and that 
“(e)ssential  water  supplies  should  be  accessible  to  all,  and  their  distribution  should  be 
managed in a participatory fashion with a particular concern for the interests of the poor” 
(p. 16). This framework identifies forms of water-supply management that give considera-
tion to ecosystems, including crop, livestock, fishing and forest activities.

Table IV.4 provides examples of adaptation technologies for water resources, 
which underline the multisectoral nature of water use and the dual (supply and demand) 
facets of adaptation technologies. Some technologies are traditional or locally based, for 
example, harvesting rainwater and building reservoirs and levees. Implementation of oth-
ers requires specialized equipment or knowledge related, for example, to increased turbine 
efficiency and desalinization. Implementation of technologies for water management also 
requires regulatory mechanisms, such as the enforcement of water standards and the curb-
ing of flood plain development.

In order to respond to the increased risk of epidemic outbreaks from climate 
change, countries in warm areas will have to enhance their systems for safely storing and 
treating water, for example, through waste-water recycling and desalinization. Investing 
in reliable water-conserving technologies for delivering clean water will be required in the 
households  and  settlements  of  many  developing  countries.  Sustainable  urban  drainage 
systems utilizing rainwater harvesting, for example, can enhance resilience to excessive 
rainfall and eliminate the threat of the production of contaminated water, which provides 
a habitat for disease vectors such as mosquitoes.

Water and sanitation systems must be made resilient with respect to the effects 
of heavy rainfalls and longer droughts. Ecological sanitation and toilet systems whose safe 
processing of human waste does not require water might become a key technology under 
water-scarce conditions.

Because of climate change, 
countries in warm areas 
will have to enhance their 
systems for safely storing 
and treating water

Health

To deal with increased 
exposure to health risks, 
improved construction for 
housing and schools  
will be required

Technologies  for  adaptation  need  to  reduce  the  exposure  of  poor  communities  to  the 
impacts of climate change by strengthening public-health systems and urban planning 
(including housing in risk-safe areas).

To  deal  with  increased  exposure  to  health  risks,  such  as  water-  and  vector-
borne diseases, in areas where climate change will raise average temperatures, improved 
construction for housing and schools will be required. Adverse impacts of rising tempera-
tures will require—just to protect health gains already achieved—increased investment in 
public-health infrastructure. Measures to reduce the health risks should be gender- and 
environment-sensitive,  particularly  in  the  context  of  development  of  technologies  and 
public-health strategies.

Low-cost and low-technology solutions such as mosquito nets and water filters 
can be only a part of a larger integrated approach to building up effective public-health 
systems.  Satellite  mapping  and  geographical  information  systems,  which  are  useful  for 
local,  regional  and  national  surveillance  of  possible  areas  affected  by  malaria  and  other 
communicable diseases sensitive to climate shocks, allow health-care professionals to assess 
priorities, reallocate resources and prevent future outbreaks. The use of these technologies 
can be more effective if poor countries are able to access finance, knowledge and expertise.

Sea-level rises endanger 
populations residing in low-
elevation coastal zones

Coastal zones

Sea-level rise increases the risk for populations residing in low-elevation coastal zones.5
About 88 per cent of the people in low-elevation coastal zones (over half of whom live in 
urban areas) reside in developing countries. Low-elevation coastal cities such as Lagos, 
Cape Town, Maputo and Mombasa often have large concentrations of low-income urban-
dwellers. Sites of economic production and strategic infrastructure concentrated in these 
cities  are  also  vulnerable  to  climate  change.  Table  IV.5  demonstrates  that  some  of  the 
most populous developing countries, such as China, India, Bangladesh, Viet Nam and 
Indonesia, have the largest number of people living in these zones. The table also indicates 
that among the top 10 countries with the highest shares of population in the low-elevation 
coastal zones, 8 are low-income or lower-middle-income countries.

were excluded from this list. If all countries had been included, 7 of the top 10 in the table would be countries 
or areas with fewer than 100,000 persons, the top 5 having more than 90 per cent of country or area in the Low 
Elevation Coastal Zone (Maldives, Marshall Islands, Tuvalu, Cayman Islands and Turks and Caicos Islands).

Three  basic  adaptation  strategies  are  available  to  coastal  communities  and 
countries: protection, retreat and accommodation. For protection, “hard” options such 
as  sea  walls  and  “soft”  options,  such  as  restoring  dunes,  creating  and  restoring  coastal 
wetlands,  and  reforestation,  could  be  relevant.  For  retreat,  the  following  might  be  ap-
propriate: the requirement that setback zones for development be at a specific distance 
from  the  water’s  edge;  legal  restrictions  on  size  and  density  of  structures  within  risky 
areas; and specification of permitted forms of shoreline stabilization. In respect of accom-
modation, warning systems for extreme weather events, new building codes, and drain-
ing systems with increased pump capacity and wider pipes would be paramount (United 
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, Subsidiary Body for Scientific and 
Technological Advice, 2010).

More broadly, policy action on technological adaptations for new settlements 
encompasses three dimensions: (a) energy-efficient technology for new building structures;

Low-elevation  coastal  zones  are  defined  as  land  areas  contiguous  with  the  coastline  up  to  a 
10-metre rise in elevation and whose width is often less than 100 kilometres.

(b) planning of settlements, including construction of appropriate infrastructure to pro-
tect against flooding (Netherlands), creation of green areas as flood buffers (Brazil) and 
design of multi land use cities to ease transportation and improve biodiversity (Seoul); and 
(c) making city services climate-friendly, for example, by offering affordable and efficient 
public transportation and adequate housing (see box IV.3).

Green restoration projects in the Republic of Korea

Levels of flooding and drought are likely to worsen in the Republic of Korea and the threat of water 
scarcity and water overabundance becomes most acute when one considers demand and supply in 
the context of possible future socio-economic and natural changes. In order to respond effectively to 
expected climate irregularities, water control policies are becoming increasingly necessary.

Securing  water  resources  is  a  critical  dimension  of  climate  change  adaptation.  In  this 
regard it is planned, as part of the Four Major Rivers Restoration Project, that about 1.3 billion cubic 
metres of water will have been secured by 2012. The Project, launched in 2009, entails restoration of 
the Han, Nakdong, Geum and Yeongsan rivers and includes a number of related projects on their 
tributaries. A significant portion of the funds for adaptation ($28 billion) will be utilized for the Project 
(the total investment for “greening” the economy of the Republic of Korea is about $84 billion).

The project has five objectives: (a) to counter water scarcity by securing abundant water 
resources; (b) to implement well-coordinated measures for flood control; (c) to improve water qual-
ity and restore ecosystems; (d) to create multi-purpose spaces for local residents; and (e) to promote 
climate-resilient regional development centred on rivers. Overall, it is expected that the project will cre-
ate 340,000 jobs and generate an estimated 40 trillion won ($31.1 billion) in positive economic effects.

The development of ecological defence systems will be continued through the setting 
up of forest protection and forest ecosystem management programmes. The Republic of Korea aims 
to increase the capacity of national forest resources from 862 million to 953 million cubic metres by 
enhancing forest protection and forest ecosystem management programmes. Forests and wetlands 
prevalent in a large part of the Korean Peninsula are being properly conserved and made more resil-
ient so as to provide natural defences against storms, cyclones, flooding and sea-level rise.

The  implementation  of  ecological  restoration  through  reforestation  can  significantly 
enhance  resilience.  The  review,  under  the  UNEP-led  study  on  the  Economics  of  Ecosystems  and 
Biodiversity, of a large number of restoration projects suggests that through ecological restoration, 
resilience improvements can be achieved in three significant areas of adaptation: (a) freshwater secu-
rity; (b) food security (involving both artisanal fisheries and small-farm productivity); and (c) manage-
ment of natural hazard risks (cyclones, storms, floods and droughts).

Institutional change and capacity building

For disaster risk reduction technologies to be put in place effectively in poor countries, 
those  countries  need  to  strengthen  their  institutions.  The  United  Nations  Framework 
Convention on Climate Change6—acting under the Technology Transfer Framework— 
assessed the institutional gaps in developing countries in the course of undertaking tech-
nology needs assessments. Technology needs assessments track the need for new equip-
ment and techniques (“hard technology”) and for the practical knowledge and skills (“soft 
technology”) required to adapt and reduce vulnerability to the adverse impacts of climate 
change (Hecl, 2010). In their technology needs assessments 68 countries highlighted ca-
pacity development as a technology priority.

It  is  crucial  for  Governments  and  the  international  community  to  support 
investment in capacity development, including in higher education focused on technologi-
cally oriented careers and in programmes that promote practices of sustainable consump-
tion. The Government of Nigeria provides such support through a programme, in which 
specially trained instructors educate primary and post-primary school children in Lagos 
on climate change effects and environmental management. The young people then act as 
agents of change by reaching out to the larger society. “Climate change clubs” have been 
established in many primary and post-primary institutions having trained instructors.

Building  local  innovation  capacity  in  developing  countries  is  essential  for 
the  adaptation  of  renewable  energy  technologies.  The  training  of  the  next  generation 
of  technicians  and  professionals  must  be  actively  supported,  and  national  innovation 
plans should include support for local education and research and for their linkages with 
international innovation centres (United Nations, Department of Economic and Social 
Affairs, 2009).

The  challenge  is  to  create  institutional  mechanisms  that  facilitate  access  of 
vulnerable communities not only to knowledge and finance but also to adaptation tech-
nologies.  Fiscal  systems  whose  purpose  will  be  to  transfer  resources  to  technologically 
disadvantaged economic sectors and less educated populations need to be widely explored 
and  carefully  designed  so  as  to  reduce  the  impact  of  negative  responses.  Likewise,  the 
active participation of all stakeholders, both women and men, in the implementation of 
adaptation technologies can promote greater support for the benefits of adaptation.

Extension programmes can be an important means of sharing information on 
technology  transfer,  building  capacity  among  low-income  urban  communities  and  en-
couraging residents to form their own networks. Community organizations, for example, 
can be an effective information-sharing mechanism with the potential to provide cost-
effective links between government efforts and community activities, while investment 
incentives and tax relief can entice the local private sector into engaging in technology 
transfer.  Non-governmental  organizations  can  play  the  role  of  intermediaries  by  facili-
tating investment, identifying adaptation technologies, and providing management and 
technical assistance.

Engaging the private sector requires the strengthening of countries’ institu-
tional base, including the provision of incentives to support, for example, architectural 
changes, hazard insurance and development of new consumer products. Policies to induce 
the participation of private insurance companies in the enforcement of standards can also 
be appropriate.

The training of the next 
generation of technicians 
and professionals must be 
actively supported

Extension programmes can 
be important for building 
capacity among low-
income urban communities

Financing and external transfers

Adaptation technologies can be classified by sector and by stage of technological maturity 
(see table IV.6). The agriculture, livestock and fisheries sector lays claim to the bulk of 
these  technologies,  followed  by  the  coastal  zones  and  infrastructure  sectors.  The  early 
warning  and  forecasting  sector  utilizes  the  largest  number  of  technologies  classified  as 
“high”. Global estimates for the additional annual investment and financial flows needed 
for technological adaptation to the adverse effects of climate change range from $32.6 
billion  to  $163.1  billion  in  2030  (United  Nations  Framework  Convention  on  Climate 
Change, Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice, 2009, table 8). These 
estimates,  which  include  the  costs  of  infrastructure,  health,  water  supply  and  coastal 

Ballpark figures suggest 
that the cost of the 
resources needed for 
adaptation are significant 
but not prohibitive.

a  Traditional/indigenous technologies are those that have been first developed in traditional societies to respond 
to specific local problems. Modern technologies comprise approaches that have been created since the first 
industrial revolution, including the use of synthetic materials, modern medicines, hybrid crops, modern forms of 
transportation and new chemicals. High technologies comprise technologies created based on recent scientific 
advances, including information and communications technology, computer monitoring and modelling, and 
engineering of genetically modified organisms.

projects, are based on assumptions on the likely course of climate change, although more 
detailed and localized studies are required to improve their accuracy. Further, assisting de-
veloping countries in obtaining realistic estimates on climate change impacts and extreme 
events will also improve the quality of the global database. While these numbers reflect a 
great deal of uncertainty, as the ballpark figures they suggest that the cost of the resources 
needed for adaptation is significant but not prohibitive.

Under the Cancun Adaptation Framework, it was recognized “that developed 
country Parties (would) commit to … a goal of mobilizing jointly USD 100 billion per 
year by 2020 to address the needs of developing countries” (see FCCC/CP/2010/7/Add.1, 
decision  1/CP.16,  para.  98).  In  comparison  with  existing  estimates,  the  Cancun  com-
mitment can be seen as a modest first step in funding transfers to developing countries 
for climate change purposes. These funds would come “from a wide variety of sources, 
public and private, bilateral and multilateral, including alternative sources” (ibid., para. 
99) with a “significant share of new multilateral funding for adaptation (flowing) through 
the Green Climate Fund” (ibid., para. 100).

The institutional mechanism that will implement and monitor the use of the 
“significant share” to be allocated for adaptation purposes has yet to be determined. It is clear, 
however, that the implementation of sustainable development plans in poor countries depends 
on stable sources of local finance and effective mobilization of resources at the international 
level. Concrete steps need to be taken to respond to the needs of developing countries.

The way forward

Drawing  on  indigenous  knowledge,  adapting  existing  technologies  for  the  purpose  of 
building infrastructure and housing and installing monitoring and response systems pro-
vide the key to successful disaster risk reduction efforts. However, investments in disaster 
risk reduction are constrained by competing investment claims on a finite public sector 
budget. Faced with the knowledge that one extreme disaster can wipe out the gains of 
decades of development investment, every society will still have to decide how much of 
its resources can be devoted to disaster risk reduction efforts. While projects designed to 
deal with seasonal and well-known risks would normally be given investment priority, do-
mestic social priorities will shape how much technology and investment spending can be 
directed towards reducing longer-term hazards and truly catastrophic events. It is therefore 
critical that disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation efforts be incorporated 
in national development strategies in order to ensure that priorities for disaster risk man-
agement are defined within that context.

Transborder natural hazards will require strengthening regional cooperation 
in the area of monitoring, forecasting and warning systems. Countries could also cooper-
ate in disaster risk assessments and undertake multinational projects in risk reduction.

The longer-term hazards being imposed by climate change are global in source, 
but  local  in  impact.  Global  cooperation  will  require  facilitating  technology  transfer  to 
developing countries. So that the advantages of foreign technology in adaptation and risk 
reduction projects can be realized, technology transfer should ensure that recipients have 
the capacity to install, operate, maintain and repair imported technologies. It might also 
be important for local adapters to be able to produce lower-cost versions of imported tech-
nologies and adapt imported technologies to domestic markets and circumstances. The 
international community has made a commitment to providing external assistance to local 
adaptation programmes and while most estimates suggest that the overall call on adapta-
tion resources is not prohibitive, the operational modalities for predictable and adequate 
resource flows to developing countries still need to be agreed upon (see chap. VI).

By protecting livelihoods against disaster, disaster risk reduction and climate 
change adaptation projects contribute to development (United Nations, 2008b). As noted, 
such projects have synergies with other development imperatives, including in the areas of 
construction, housing, transportation systems, basic services provisioning, manufacturing 
and employment absorption. The effort to manage the needed adaptation of both foreign 
and indigenous technology so as ensure the reduction of the impact of natural disasters 
and climate change should be embedded in the larger project of achieving national indus-
trial development and innovation. This subject will be taken up in chapter V.

Domestic social priorities 
will shape how much 
technology and investment 
spending can be directed 
towards reducing longer-
term hazards and truly 
catastrophic events

Chapter V
National policies for  
green development

Summary
Technological  innovation  is  at  the  heart  of  sustainable  development.  “Catching  up”  with 
industrialized  countries  requires  strong  technology  policies.  A  green  sustainability-oriented 
national innovation system (G-NIS) should be an integral part of developing countries’ national 
development strategies. 
Widespread  adaptation  and  diffusion  of  green  technologies  require  effective  government 
industrial  policies  to  “crowd  in”  private  investment.  Green  technologies  should  be  treated  as 
infant industries, with appropriate support, including public sector investments in infrastructure, 
subsidies and access to credit. 
Building an innovative economy is not about overcoming price distortions or enforcing property 
rights.  An  innovative  economy  is  based  on  interactive  learning,  information  exchange,  timely 
availability of finance and other resources, and coordination among firms, universities, research 
centres, policymakers and other actors.

Introduction

Technological innovation is at the heart of economic and social development. Building 
technological  capacities  can  help  developing  countries  “catch  up”  with  more  advanced 
countries, and innovation policy must play an important role in facilitating sustainable 
development. The present chapter argues that green sustainable development-oriented in-
novation policies should be an integral part of countries’ national development strategies.
The use of green technologies can have many benefits for developing countries. 
It  can  improve  domestic  infrastructure,  help  reach  underserved  communities  that  lack 
access to electricity, clean water and sanitation, and create jobs. Since many green products 
are initially developed in industrialized countries, technology transfer from developed to 
developing countries is a necessary part of this process. However, the conventional view 
that technology is developed in the North and simply transferred to the South is mislead-
ing. Technology transfer involves more than the importation of hardware: it involves the 
complex process of sharing knowledge and adapting technologies to meet local conditions. 
More broadly, innovation is not limited to new breakthroughs: most innovation involves 
incremental improvements and adaptations of existing technologies.

Innovation,  in  this  sense,  is  widespread  in  many  emerging  market  and  de-
veloping countries. China and India, in particular, have become global leaders in some 
green  technologies,  such  as  solar  photovoltaic  (PV)  panels,  wind  turbines,  and  electric 
and hybrid-electric vehicles, in part because they were able to improve and adapt existing

technologies and production processes. Some low-income countries have also begun to de-
velop domestic technological capacities, successfully adapt green technologies, and build 
new industries, such as the solar PV industry in Bangladesh.

In all cases, government policies have played important roles in the innovation 
process. Private investors are often unlikely to invest in many new technologies without 
government  support,  especially  when  these  technologies  are  not  cost-competitive  with 
the technologies that are already in place. This is the case for many green technologies, 
in part because market prices do not fully incorporate the societal costs of using brown 
technologies, such as greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental risks, with which 
green  technologies  compete.  Typical  market-based  solutions  to  this  have  been  carbon 
taxes or “cap and trade” schemes aimed at incorporating the societal costs into market 
prices, along with strong intellectual property rights to encourage investment in green 
technologies. However, higher energy prices due to carbon taxes can have the perverse 
effect of disrupting economic development in poor countries, and strong property rights 
can impede knowledge transfer and inhibit innovation. Furthermore, this approach comes 
up against an affordability wall in most developing countries, which must nevertheless 
participate in this technological makeover as they attempt structural change over the next 
few decades.

More broadly, building an innovative economy is not about overcoming price 
distortions  and  enforcing  property  rights.  An  innovative  economy  is  based  on  interac-
tive learning, information exchange, and coordination among firms, universities, research 
centres, policymakers and other actors. The national innovation system (NIS) approach, 
which  emphasizes  the  importance  of  these  relationships,  thus  provides  a  more  useful 
framework than a market-based approach for analysing innovation policy. A green sus-
tainability-oriented NIS (G-NIS), which integrates the public-goods nature of many green 
technologies into the NIS framework, is particularly useful for innovation policymaking 
in the context of long-term sustainable development.

This framework suggests that active industrial policies are necessary for the 
adaptation and diffusion of green technologies. Green technologies should be treated as 
infant industries, with appropriate support, including public sector investments in infra-
structure, subsidies and access to credit (Ocampo, 2011b). Policies should also be designed 
to encourage interaction and knowledge-sharing among domestic and international firms, 
research institutes, universities, policymakers and other actors. Other policy suggestions 
based on a green systemic approach could encompass innovative sources of equity-linked 
financing and long-horizon green country funds.

Catching  up  with  industrialized  countries  requires  strong  technology  poli-
cies. The G-NIS approach emphasizes that policymakers do indeed need to make choices 
on how to best support innovation, and suggests a framework for government decision-
making and investment.

Market and systemic failures

Many economists argue that the role of government is to correct market failures. In contrast, 
in an NIS or systems approach, the role of government is to correct systemic failures, which 
might include market failures, but can also include weak relationships between agents or in-
stitutions which are difficult to capture in traditional economic models. A systemic analysis 
also focuses on how changing incentives in one area negatively affect incentives in others.

Uncertainty, externalities and public goods-related problems
All investment is uncertain, but investment in innovation is particularly uncertain as the 
future  outcomes  of  today’s  investment  projects  are  unknown.1  Innovation  is  also  con-
fronted with a public goods-related problem. Knowledge in its pure form is a public good, 
insofar as it is available to everyone and its use by one person does not limit its use by 
others. Hence, it is difficult for private firms to appropriate the full returns from research 
activity. In the market failure approach, patents are meant to confer a degree of ownership 
of the fruits of new knowledge by granting the innovators fixed-term monopoly rights.

The systemic approach, in contrast, emphasizes that strong intellectual prop-
erty rights can also undercut knowledge-sharing, thereby impeding innovation. Further, 
even when such institutional mechanisms exist, investors still underinvest in research and 
development (R&D) (Mani, 2002). A typical policy response is to fund basic research 
through grants or public research institutes. The systems approach, however, might also 
suggest joint research grants to encourage collaboration among universities, research in-
stitutes and firms.

Innovation with regard to green technologies is subject to heightened uncer-
tainty,  externalities,  path  dependencies,  and  additional  public  goods-related  problems. 
Investment  risk  is  heightened,  since  there  is  greater  uncertainty  about  what  the  entire 
market, not just the specific technology, will look like in the future. Green technologies 
compete with brown technologies currently in use, most of which have large environmen-
tal externalities and other social costs that are not factored into market prices. As discussed 
above, carbon taxes and cap-and-trade schemes were supposed to be so designed as to 
address these issues. It appears, however, that the increase in price needed to cover all the 
externalities would likely be so large as to prove politically unfeasible (Mowery, Nelson 
and Martin, 2010). For developing countries, these schemes can be problematic, as they 
would raise the price of existing energy sources and other inputs, which could disrupt 
economic development, at least until new energy sources became available. And they can 
be  particularly  problematic,  given  the  potential  impact  of  higher  energy  prices  on  the 
poor. Industrial policies to encourage diffusion of green technologies provide an alterna-
tive policy prescription. Furthermore, there are opportunities in some poor countries for 
leapfrogging, which industrial policies could encourage.

There are also path dependencies associated with existing carbon technologies 
that are difficult for new technologies to overcome, even when the new technologies are 
potentially  superior.  For  example,  existing  technologies  have  large  sunk  costs  in  infra-
structure, which constrain their replacement. New technologies often have high operating 
expenses and are often less reliable in the early stages of development. This is true of most 
green technologies, even those like wind and solar PV that have longer histories (Mowery, 
Nelson and Martin, 2010.) It can also be difficult for any one new technology to overcome 
the dominant technology “regime” and change what is often an entire system, such as the 
energy system (Smith, 2009). Furthermore, existing technologies tend to serve entrenched 
interests, making it difficult for policymakers to support new technologies at the expense 
of existing ones.

Green technologies also have additional public goods-related problems. As dis-
cussed above, green technologies support infrastructure, reach underserved communities 
and promote equity, increase energy, food and water security, and have the potential to

create new industries and jobs (Cosbey, 2011a). However, private investors tend to under-
invest in green technologies because they are unable to capture these public benefits in 
their investment returns.

Finally, financial markets tend to be myopic and to be characterized by boom-
and-bust cycles, which can be particularly severe in new illiquid investment sectors, such 
as green technology (Stiglitz and others, 2006). For example, although “green investment 
funds” had raised a large amount of capital prior to 2007, most experienced significant 
withdrawals during and after the financial crisis, as discussed below. Cyclically oriented 
financing cannot be counted on to support long-term sustainable development, and poli-
cymakers should focus on alternative forms of investment.

Systems of innovation
National innovation systems

The  concept  of  a  national  innovation  system  (NIS)  was  first  introduced  in  the  1980s 
(Nelson and Winter, 1982; Freeman, 1997). Although the general concept of a national 
innovation system is widely accepted (Nelson, 1993; Lundvall, ed., 2010; Metcalfe, 1994), 
there is no single definition. According to a broad definition, such as the one given by 
Edquist (2004), the NIS is “all important economic, social, political, organization, insti-
tutional, and other factors that influence the development, diffusion, and use of innova-
tions”. Hence, every country has an NIS, whether or not policymakers are conscious of 
it. It is a dynamic system that develops and changes over time. While it is not created by 
Governments, government policies can strengthen (or weaken) its efficiency.

Sector-specific green innovation systems

Innovation of green technologies covers a wide range of economic sectors, including en-
ergy, transportation, agriculture, industrial production, materials, buildings, water, and 
waste management (Johnstone, Hascic and Popp, 2010). These sectors differ with regard 
to characteristics such as firm size, the role of foreign direct investment (FDI), skill re-
quirements, capital intensity, and the degree of integration into the global market. For 
example, while the energy sector tends to be dominated by a few large firms, agriculture in 
developing countries involves many small rural land holders, which can make knowledge-
sharing and diffusion of innovation particularly challenging. An agricultural innovation 
system thus needs to focus on informal actors, such as community networks (Gallagher 
and others, 2011; Juma, 2011). Sectoral innovation systems (Malerba, 2002; Malerba and 
Nelson, 2008) address differences in the innovation process across economic sectors.

Because sector-specific innovation systems are specialized, they can be particu-
larly useful as frameworks for sector-specific policy analysis. Chapters II and III examined 
energy and agricultural innovation systems; the discussion of both types of systems is fairly 
well developed in the literature (United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, 
2010; Grübler and others, forthcoming bis; Juma, 2011). There is a significant literature on 
other sector-specific systems as well, such as chemicals, pharmaceuticals and electronics, 
but more research is needed on other sector-specific green sustainability-oriented innova-
tion systems.

National policies for green development  

135

However,  sole  reliance  on  sector-specific  systems  could  overlook  economy-
wide linkages especially relevant to green innovation since the impact of environmental 
externalities in one sector can affect other sectors. For example, hydroelectric plants are 
a clean energy source, but often have negative externalities, such as displacing people, 
harming agriculture, reducing fish populations, and deforestation.2 On the other hand, 
they can also have positive externalities, such as lowering the risk of floods and provid-
ing  irrigation  for  agriculture.  A  national  system,  especially  one  that  is  sustainability-
oriented, provides a framework for promoting better understanding of all the relations 
and  trade-offs  involved  in  hydroelectric  plants  compared  with  other  forms  of  energy. 
Though policymakers might consider many of these implications in any case, a green, 
sustainability-oriented national innovation system (a G-NIS) would provide a systematic 
framework for doing so.

“Greening” national innovation systems

Greening an NIS involves incorporating unique features of sustainability into the systems 
framework.3 There is a greater role for government and non-governmental organizations in 
a G-NIS framework because of the public-goods nature of green technologies. Although 
government policies are important in an NIS, particularly in the early stages of the devel-
opment process, they are particularly important in a G-NIS, given the lack of domestic 
markets for green technologies. A G-NIS approach emphasizes incentives and industrial 
policies geared towards creating market demand throughout the innovation cycle (such as 
feed-in tariffs, low-interest loans and public procurement), which are not generally neces-
sary for an NIS (Stamm and others, 2009). Because of the enhanced uncertainty associ-
ated with green technologies, policymakers might need to emphasize greater risk-sharing 
between the private and public sectors so as to stimulate private sector investment. In addi-
tion, the G-NIS takes account of environmental and other externalities, and incorporates 
technological, industrial and environmental policies within one framework.

Although  G-NISs  differ  by  country,  based  on  existing  institutions,  human 
capital, business environment, infrastructure, geography and general level of development, 
they possess elements in common, as depicted in figure V.1. The innovation process is at 
the centre of the G-NIS. The actors in the system include firms, government agencies, 
universities, research institutes, training institutes, consumers, financial and non-financial 
institutions, private foundations and civil society.

Relationships and interactions among actors are crucial to the innovation proc-
ess. These relationships include networks of innovators, research clusters, and coordination 
among universities and firms, upstream and downstream suppliers and their customers, 
and buyers and sellers. Institutions and infrastructure are the backdrop that shapes the 
innovation process; they are depicted as such as the light red circle in figure V.2. Industrial 
policies, such as public procurement, tax schemes and subsidies, define incentives for the 
actors and also shape the system. 

Knowledge, increased capabilities and new technologies are important outputs 
of  the  system.  These  can  be  viewed  as  positive  externalities  of  the  system  and  are  de-
picted in figure V.2 as arrows emanating from the G-NIS to the rest of the economy. The

There are five phases in the 
innovation process. Market 
formation is added to the 
usual four phases

The innovation process

The innovation process is composed of interdependent phases (Mowery and Rosenberg, 
1979), which feed back into one another, as depicted in figure V.1. The literature typically 
refers to four phases in the process: research, development, demonstration and diffusion 
(RDD&D). Following Grübler and others (forthcoming bis), “market formation” is added 
to the usual four, since markets for new green products do not automatically develop after 
the diffusion stage.

The five phases do not necessarily follow in order: some are sometimes skipped 
or inapplicable to a given technology or process (Gallagher and others, 2011; Grübler and 
Messner, 1998). In addition, there are feedbacks between stages, so that phases often occur 
simultaneously. For example, during the diffusion process, end-users provide producers 
with feedback, which should lead to product improvements and further adaptations.

Basic research, development and demonstration (RD&D)

Figure  V.2  depicts  the  development  phases  (RD&D)  of  the  innovation  process,  along 
with the type of financing typically available for the different phases. The government is 
often the main actor in basic research, through funding for universities or public research 
laboratories. In the United States of America, Europe and, more recently, China, many 
technological breakthroughs of the past decades, including innovations in aeronautics and 
electronics, were facilitated or funded by Governments (United Nations, Department of 
Economic and Social Affairs, 2008).

The government is often 
the main actor in basic 
research, while development 
and demonstration are 
based on entrepreneurial 
experimentation within firms

In the case of green 
technologies, market 
demand is primarily 
determined by government 
policies

Policies aimed at market 
formation include 
environmental regulations

Development and demonstration, which are based on entrepreneurial experi-
mentation, generally take place within firms. Entrepreneurs potentially continue to acquire 
commercially useful product-related information during these phases, which then feeds 
back into research. For example, several types of wind turbines were experimented with 
before the three-blade vertical-axis turbine was developed. Similarly, the development of 
hybrid vehicles entailed entrepreneurial experimentation among Japan’s car manufacturers 
(Grübler and others, forthcoming bis).

However, financing for these advanced stages of product development is gener-
ally limited, particularly in the so-called valley of death, for which the investment risk is 
still high, but government financing often limited (Gallagher and others, 2011). Funding 
for this stage often comes from the entrepreneur’s own savings or from family members. 
Venture capitalists tend to fund projects that have already been demonstrated in the mar-
ketplace, although they have been hesitant to take risks associated with some investments 
in green technologies, especially in developing countries, as discussed below. Thus, the 
development phase of many technologies—and particularly green technologies—needs to 
be supplemented by government policies.

Market formation and diffusion

Diffusion and widespread use of technologies are a critical part of the innovation process, 
and are usually financed by the private sector. However, many clean energy technologies 
fail to transition from product development to diffusion not necessarily because of techno-
logical problems, but because they are too expensive relative to existing brown technolo-
gies or too difficult to integrate into existing systems (owing to path dependencies) or scale 
up, or because of lack of market demand for other reasons.

As discussed in chapter II, historically, market formation of new energy prod-
ucts focused on creating protected “niche” markets. These markets shield products from 
full commercial competition in the initial stages of product development, based on the ex-
pectation that some end-users would be willing to pay a higher price for high-quality tech-
nologies, and that as a result these technologies will not need to be subsidized. However, 
as there are few niches today in which cost-insensitive end-users are willing to pay for 
environmental public goods, this strategy is less appropriate for green technologies.

The role of government in the market formation stage can be critical to over-
coming barriers to market formation and diffusion. As discussed below, policies aimed 
at  market  formation  include  environmental  regulations,  minimum  production  quotas, 
public procurement policies, subsidies and feed-in tariffs, as well as risk-sharing policies 
designed to encourage greater private sector investment.

Coordination and networks

Because  innovation  is  based  on  interactive  learning,  information  exchange,  coordina-
tion and feedback are important throughout the innovation process. Indeed, innovation, 
adaptation and diffusion are dependent on such interactions. Coordination between re-
searchers and firms is critical, as are interactions between firms and networks and clusters. 
Further,  interactions  between  domestic  and  international  firms  facilitate  the  ability  of 
domestic firms to tap into global knowledge and build domestic capacities. Interactions 
among government agencies, firms, research institutes, universities and civil society can 
help inform policymaking.

from university and 
research centres for

networks and engage in 
South-South collaboration

Cooperation among universities,  
research institutions and firms

There is evidence that cooperation among universities, public research organizations and 
firms is likely to stimulate private sector R&D (Jaumotte and Pain, 2005), and that when 
such interactions do not exist, there is likely to be less innovation (Soete, Verspagen and 
ter Weel, 2009). In countries with high levels of innovation, such as the United States, 
Sweden and Singapore, these linkages tend to be strong. However, knowledge is not au-
tomatically transferred from university and research centres to commercial applications. 
In the newly industrialized countries in Asia, Governments made efforts to help stimulate 
these relationships (Kim and Nelson, eds., 2000), through, for example, grants for col-
laborative R&D, as well as science and technology parks.

In many developing countries, however, the linkages between universities and 
firms are weak. In Mexico, R&D is concentrated in universities, but the universities do 
not necessarily interact with private firms (Casas, 2005). In Africa, universities tend to 
be centralized, and are often unknown to producers not located nearby (Metcalfe and 
Ramlogan, 2005). Incorporating private sector inputs in education policy, as in several 
newly industrialized countries and some Latin American countries, can stimulate greater 
cooperation between firms and universities, as discussed below. In addition, collaborative 
R&D projects, joint conferences and seminars, and policies that encourage mobility of 
researchers between the public and private sector can help address this problem. For exam-
ple, in Sweden, university professors are mandated to interact with firms and stakeholders 
outside the university, in addition to engaging in teaching and research (Edquist, 2006).

Networks, clusters and science parks

Learning and knowledge spillovers tend to be stronger with geographical proximity (Walz, 
2010; Archibugi and Pietrobelli, 2003), and knowledge transfer between firms is often 
informal (Grübler and others, forthcoming bis). Clusters and networks of firms that en-
courage interactions among firms’ personnel can facilitate knowledge spillovers.

Research  networks  are  also  important  for  information-sharing,  and  sev-
eral emerging market and developing countries are taking steps to build such networks. 
Colombia has created a network of national research institutes whose goal is to develop 
sustainable energy technologies, and universities in Singapore have been developing green 
construction and water technologies (Cannady, 2009). Least developed countries, how-
ever, often do not have the resources or critical mass needed to build such networks. These 
countries should therefore form regional R&D networks and engage in South-South col-
laboration to leverage the resources of all members. For example, several Central African 
nations recently formed a university network of researchers engaged in work in the medi-
cal field (Cannady, 2009).4 Regional networks could also offer valuable opportunities to 
leverage resources of wealthier countries.

To  the  extent  that  geographical  proximity  encourages  increased  knowledge 
spillovers, local science parks, which co-locate domestic and foreign firms, universities, 
research centres, laboratories and related businesses, can be used to facilitate green innova-
tion. Science parks have been established successfully in both developed and emerging 
market economies and are being planned in several African developing countries, such 
as Senegal (Tavares, 2009) and Ghana. There has been some discussion of also building 
regional science parks in Africa as an alternative to national parks. For example, a project

The most important 
function of a science park 
is to foster interactions 
among actors

being  run  by  the  United  Nations  Educational,  Scientific  and  Cultural  Organization 
(UNESCO) is examining the possibility of setting up a science park in Nairobi, which 
will then serve as a model for other such “technopolises” across Africa (United Nations 
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, 2011a).

Science parks can also offer support services, financial services and infrastruc-
ture (including buildings, meeting rooms, telephone, Internet, power and transportation), 
although business incubators can also assume this role, as discussed below. In addition, in 
some countries, such as India, firms in science parks are exempted from import duties and 
quotas, as well as from capital controls on repatriating currency.

Experience suggests that the most important function of a science park is to 
foster interactions among actors. However, policymakers have sometimes focused on the 
physical presence of the park at the expense of fostering interactions and knowledge spillo-
vers. Without a deliberate effort to encourage interactions, there is a risk that science parks 
will end up as real estate operations, instead of contributing to innovation and develop-
ment. On the other hand, if linkages or industry clusters already exist, it might not be 
necessary to build an expensive science park as a means of bringing actors together. Other 
means of encouraging interactions and sharing may be more useful and affordable. Lower-
cost options could include setting up resource centres, and technology transfer centres for 
firms in or near universities, and organizing frequent conferences and seminars in order 
to bring together domestic and foreign scientists, engineers, entrepreneurs, practitioners 
and policymakers. Furthermore, it is possible that, over time, virtual science parks will 
replace physical parks. However, to the extent that (as noted above) the goal of the park is 
to encourage interactions among actors, the importance of physical proximity cannot be 
underestimated. It is therefore unlikely that physical parks will be completely replaced by 
virtual counterparts, at least for the near future. While it is possible to organize “online 
conferences and dialogues”, sustaining interactions and virtual networking appears to be 
more difficult.

Technology transfer 
is effective only if 
supplemented by 
indigenous research and 
domestic capabilities

Traditional mechanisms 
for technology transfer are 
foreign direct investment 
(FDI), imports and licensing

International networks and technology transfer

Because much green technology is developed globally, international interactions play an 
important role in transferring technological knowledge. This can be facilitated through 
traditional  forms  of  technology  transfer,  although  it  could  also  include  other  forms  of 
knowledge  sharing,  transfer  and  collaboration.  Traditional  mechanisms  for  technology 
transfer  are  FDI,  imports  and  licensing.  Experience  demonstrates,  however,  that  these 
measures are effective only if supplemented by indigenous research and domestic capabili-
ties (Li, 2008; Fu, 2008; Mani, 2002). Indeed, one primary motive for engagement by 
developing-country firms in domestic R&D is the desire to acquire knowledge developed 
elsewhere (Cohen and Levinthal, 1990; Grübler and others, forthcoming bis). Such indig-
enous research is not necessarily limited to basic research in a university or institute and 
may very well include “learning by doing” and experimentation.

Today, countries also make use of alternative methods for technology transfer, 
such as joint R&D with international companies, outward FDI (including the acquisi-
tion of foreign firms by domestic entities), R&D overseas in existing knowledge centres, 
global joint ventures, movement of people through migration and foreign education, and 
participation in global value chains to gain access to knowledge transferred within the 
supply chain (Lema and Lema, 2010; Fu, Pietrobelli and Soete, 2010). Scientific journals 
and conferences provide access to international research, and much technical information 

National policies for green development  

141

is available on the Internet. In addition, traditional measures, such as FDI and joint ven-
tures, have at times been accompanied by investment requirements and other policies to 
promote more efficient technology transfer, as discussed below. Some of these mechanisms 
may be quite different from those utilized by Organization for Economic Cooperation and 
Development (OECD) countries. Although certain mechanisms (such as outward FDI) 
require more resources, this is not the case for all, and less developed countries should 
therefore not exclude these forms of knowledge transfer.

FDI and investment performance measures

Technology spillovers through FDI can occur through several modes, such as movement of 
trained labour from foreign to domestic firms, vertical spillovers between foreign or domestic 
suppliers and their customers, joint ventures between foreign and local firms, and transfers 
between foreign firms and their local affiliates. However, from the foreign firm’s perspective, 
the purpose of FDI is to generate a profit, not to transfer technology, and often firms will try 
to limit, rather than promote, knowledge transfer (Fu, Pietrobelli and Soete, 2010).

The empirical evidence for the effectiveness of knowledge spillovers from FDI 
is mixed (Fu, Pietrobelli and Soete, 2010). In countries like Singapore and China, where 
there is evidence of positive spillovers, they are likely the result of explicit policies pursued 
by the Government (Mani, 2002; Lema and Lema, 2010). China, for example, imple-
mented local content requirements that required foreign firms to purchase inputs from 
domestic sellers, and, in some cases, also imposed training requirements and mandated 
joint R&D programmes. Mexico, on the other hand, which did not have such policies in 
place, was less successful in capturing spillovers from FDI. One estimate is that domestic 
firms in Mexico provided only about 5 per cent of the inputs for foreign firms, while firms 
in China provided over 20 per cent (Gallagher and Shafaeddin, 2010).

In addition, there is a risk that FDI can reduce or crowd out indigenous R&D 
(Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, 2002). In China, this phe-
nomena has been attributed to competition for talent between foreign and domestic firms 
(Fu and Gong, 2011), which is likely to be even more pronounced in countries with more 
limited technological capacities. The movement of workers between foreign and domestic 
firms could help counteract this tendency somewhat, at least over a longer time-horizon. 
In China, clusterings of innovative foreign firms were more likely to lead to knowledge 
spillovers (Chen, Li and Shapiro, 2009), which is a further argument for the establishment 
of science parks or lower-cost alternatives.

Knowledge spillovers from 
FDI are likely the result of 
explicit policies pursued by 
the Government

Technology transfer through imports: Kenya and Bangladesh

Importing  machinery  and  equipment  is  generally  regarded  as  another  mechanism  for 
technology transfer. However, it is not clear how effective this mechanism is insofar as 
importing machinery does not necessarily mean that countries have mastered how the 
machinery is designed. Countries first need to service, maintain and “reverse-engineer” 
the machinery to understand the technology embedded within it, which requires local 
capacities and indigenous R&D.

The cases of solar PV in Bangladesh and Kenya provide contrasting studies on 
technology transfer through imports. Both countries have rural populations that suffer 
from poor access to electricity; both have ample sunshine, which enables solar home sys-
tems (SHS) to be somewhat competitive with alternative sources of energy in rural areas; 
in both cases, private firms imported SHS; and both have had relative success in SHS

distribution. However, only Bangladesh used the opportunity to build a local manufactur-
ing industry.

In Kenya (see box V.1), the dealerships that initially imported the solar equip-
ment in the early 1990s had very little technical expertise; imports were plagued with 
quality problems, which domestic firms lacked the expertise to service. As of 2009, most 
technicians still lacked sufficient technical training (Hankins, Anjali and Kirai, 2009). 
The lack of domestic competencies also meant that Kenya lacked the institutional capacity 
to implement and enforce standards. In addition, lack of domestic financing meant that 
the systems reached mainly the wealthiest rural population. Further, local firms did not 
engage in indigenous research or significant adaptation.

Box V.1

Solar PV in rural Kenya

Kenya’s  off-grid  solar  PV  household  system  (SHS)  market  is  a  commercial  market,  with  very  little 
government involvement. It represents vibrant solar markets, with 150,000 units having been sold 
in 2004 and close to 300,000 in 2009 (REN21, 2010). Yet, despite this relative commercial success, the 
industry has been plagued by quality problems (Jacobson and Kammen, 2007), owing to a lack of 
domestic expertise and capabilities as well as a weak regulatory framework. 

Kenya had begun to import solar PV household systems in relatively significant numbers 
in the 1990s. However, the development of the industry was hampered by the above-mentioned 
lack of domestic expertise. For example, only 17 per cent of solar technicians were able to correctly 
size the battery for an SHS (Duke, Jacobson and Kammen, 2002). A significant portion of the im-
ported panels were of extremely poor quality and many households that purchased the poor-quality 
systems lost most or all of their investment (ibid.). As of 2009, the training of technicians remained 
weak, with the estimated 2,000 installation technicians who service SHS generally lacking in sufficient 
formal training (Hankins, Angali and Kirai, 2009).

Despite the quality problems, demand for the systems has continued to grow owing 
to  the  lack  of  viable  alternatives  in  rural  areas.  However,  financing  is  limited  and,  when  available, 
tends  to  be  prohibitive,  adding  up  to  80  per  cent  to  the  overall  cost  of  the  systems  (Ondraczek, 
2011). Purchasers of SHS are thus among the wealthiest rural households, with almost half of the SHS 
owned by the top 10 per cent of the rural population (Jacobson, 2005). Because of the lack of financ-
ing, demand for SHS has also tended to be “component-based”, meaning that suppliers sell pieces 
at a time, rather than entire systems, which has compounded quality problems (Hankins, Anjali and 
Kirai, 2009).

In response to pressure from local users, the Kenya Bureau of Standards drafted per-
formance standards for solar products. However, the Bureau did not have the necessary expertise to 
design and enforce these standards. As there are still no domestic accredited laboratories in Kenya, 
the  accreditation  for  quality  standards  takes  place  abroad  (Jacobson  and  Kammen,  2007),  which 
inevitably increases domestic costs and limits potential feedback between consumers and suppliers. 
As  of  2009,  enforcement  of  standards  is  still  weak,  which  has  led  to  a  market  perception  among 
consumers of solar PV of its being “second rate” (Hankins, Anjali and Kirai, 2009). As regards building 
domestic industries and ancillary services, most of the parts for SHS are still imported, although there 
are three domestic manufacturers of local batteries and nine manufacturers of lamps (International 
Energy Agency, Photovoltaic Power Systems Programme, 2003).

The  case  of  Bangladesh  (see  box  V.2)  contrasts  starkly  with  that  of  Kenya. 
Owing to its vocational education system, Bangladesh had a stronger human resource base 
at the outset than Kenya. Grameen Shakti (SK), a subsidiary of Grameen Bank, invested 
in building local capacities: trained engineers taught less skilled workers how to service 
the units. It also engaged in in-house research, which reduced costs and helped SK develop 
ancillary business. Bangladesh used its microfinance network to finance SHS and reach

Box V.2

Importing solar PV in Bangladesh

The solar household systems (SHS) industry in Bangladesh partnered with microfinance institutions, 
international organizations and the Government. Grameen Shakti (GS), a subsidiary of Grameen Bank, 
began importing solar home units in 1996. By 2010, it had sold 650,000 to off-grid rural customers in 
Bangladesh (Gallagher and others, 2011).

The  establishment  of  a  standardized  technical  and  vocational  infrastructure  over  50 
years  ago  created  a  base  of  expertise,  which  enabled  the  development  of  the  industry.  The  vast 
majority of field engineers who sell, install and maintain SHS in Bangladesh have received a diploma 
in engineering from the Bangladesh Technical Education Board. These engineers, many of whom are 
women, also train less educated women on how to construct and repair component parts of solar PV 
systems, which creates a positive effect cascading down to less educated workers.

Financing for SHS sales is generally conducted through microfinance. To aid in this ef-
fort, the Government set up the financial institution IDCOL (Infrastructure Development Company 
Limited) in 1997, with financing from the World Bank. IDCOL works with partner organizations (such 
as GS), which sell the units and provide financing to customers. To ensure quality standards, these 
organizations are required to sell components approved by a technical standards committee, includ-
ing experts from Government, the rural electrical agency and the technical university.

In  addition  to  being  involved  in  sales,  GS  is  engaged  in  indigenous  research,  which 
has helped GS reduce the cost of the panels, adapt the technology and develop accessories, such 
as a mobile phone battery charger (Chhabara, 2008). Initially, most of the panel components were 
imported, but today, all the parts are produced domestically. In this regard, Rahimafrooz, a local firm 
that initially manufactured lead-acid batteries for the systems, has expanded its operation to include 
exports to Nepal and Bhutan. More recently, Rahimafrooz set up the first solar panel assembly plant 
in Bangladesh (Parvez, 2009) and has begun to export panels to Africa (Ahmed, 2011); in addition, it 
has signed a memorandum of understanding with TATA BP Solar on building a 5 megawatt (mw) 
solar power plant in Bangladesh (Daily Star, 2010), thereby further building international linkages.

In  addition  to  creating  employment  through  these  new  manufacturing  industries, 
the off-grid solar sector has created thousands of jobs in rural Bangladesh.  GS itself employs more 
than  7,500  individuals  and  operates  45  technology  centres  run  by  women  engineers.  These  cen-
tres  have  trained  over  3,000  rural  women  who  generally  lack  access  to  other  income-generating 
opportunities.

broader populations. The Government set up a State-owned infrastructure development 
company and set standards to support financing and ensure quality. At the same time, 
companies in Bangladesh took advantage of the growth of the sector to provide ancillary 
services. Today, all the components of the systems are produced domestically. Further, 
Bangladesh has set up its first solar assembly plant and begun to export panels to Africa.

The cases of Bangladesh and Kenya offer several lessons on the use of imports 
to effect technology transfer. First, in Bangladesh, domestic capabilities were crucial for 
the servicing and operation of units, as well as for building ancillary businesses and spur-
ring employment and growth. The experience of Bangladesh demonstrates the importance 
of vocational education, on-the-job training, and the role that women can play in fostering 
green innovation. Second, in Bangladesh, indigenous research helped cut costs and led 
to successful adaptation, as well as the development of new businesses. Third, regulators 
need institutional capacity to be able to enforce quality standards. Fourth, coordination 
among university, regulators and foreign and domestic firms was an important element in 
Bangladesh’s success, whereas these linkages were weak in Kenya. Finally, in Bangladesh, 
the Government enforced quality standards and developed a rural energy development 
fund to overcome financing shortfalls.

Licensing and alternative modes of technology transfer: China and India

Licensing agreements  
have been used for  
green technologies

Companies can develop 
strategic partnerships 
with international firms 
and universities through 
collaborative R&D

The ability to draw back 
diaspora members can be 
an important element in 
knowledge transfer

The third traditional mechanism, licensing agreements, has been used fairly extensively for 
green technologies. The effectiveness of licensing for knowledge spillovers is dependent on 
local capabilities and R&D.

Both China and India used licensing agreements as part of their initial in-
vestments in clean-energy wind and solar technologies, and supplemented licensing with 
indigenous  research,  often  conducted  in  collaboration  with  domestic  universities  and 
research  institutes  supported  by  subsidies  and  public  investment.  Over  time,  licensing 
shifted  to  co-development  with  foreign  partners,  as  firms  attempted  to  build  learning 
networks (Lema and Lema, 2010).

Although  there  were  differences  in  strategies  (firms  in  China  focused  on 
building domestic learning networks, while companies in India focused on international 
learning  networks),  companies  in  both  countries  developed  strategic  partnerships  with 
international  firms  and  universities  through  collaborative  R&D.  For  example,  India’s 
wind  company  Suzlon  built  R&D  centres  and  manufacturing  units  in  Germany,  the 
Netherlands and the United States in order to tap into foreign expertise (Lewis, 2007a). 
While China’s wind turbine industry was initially focused on the domestic market, the 
solar industry concentrated on exports to take advantage of government subsidies for solar 
energy in developed countries, emphasizing the importance of international markets to 
domestic innovation systems (Fu, 2011).

Both  countries  also  benefited  from  human  resources  trained  abroad.  Many 
of the leaders in China’s most important solar firms had spent time studying abroad, and 
either returned to China to start their own firms or were recruited to join existing ones 
(Gallagher and others, 2011).

From brain drain to brain gain

The cases of China and India point to a potential role for the diaspora in transferring 
international knowledge. However, many developing countries experience the reverse ef-
fect: outmigration of skilled labour to developed countries, which has increased rapidly 
over the past two decades (Docquier, Lohest and Marfouk, 2007). From the perspective 
of building domestic capabilities, the challenges for policymakers are first, how to keep 
educated people from leaving by developing opportunities at home; and second, how to 
draw those participating in the diaspora back to the country, or find other ways to encour-
age them to share their expertise and skills and form business linkages (United Nations 
Conference on Trade and Development, 2007).

Some advanced emerging markets and newly industrialized economies, such as 
China, the Republic of Korea and Taiwan Province of China, have set up programmes to 
encourage emigrants to return. China has set up more than 100 special high-technology 
parks  to  draw  back  nationals  from  overseas  (Dahlman,  2008).  In  Taiwan  Province  of 
China, there is a State information clearing house for potential employers and returning 
researchers, with airfare and other subsidies for those who return (Davone, 2007).

However,  the  effectiveness  of  many  of  these  strategies  is  conditional  on  a 
country’s level of development (United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, 
2007).  While  newly  industrialized  countries  such  as  China  can  take  advantage  of  the 
temporary  migration  of  students  and  workers  to  develop  scientific  capacities,  very  few 
African countries are in this position. Nonetheless, as difficult as it is to draw back di-
aspora members, the ability to do so can be an important element in knowledge transfer,

and could be especially important for countries with weak education systems. In fact, a 
number  of  countries  have  programmes  that  encourage  citizens  to  obtain  their  student 
education abroad by financing it, on condition that those students bring home their skills 
by working in the home country, generally in the public sector, for a number of years after 
graduation, or after acquiring work experience.

To attract new generations of scientists, policymakers need to build a scientific 
infrastructure accompanied by changes in culture by promoting innovation and collabora-
tion (Tole and Vale, 2010). In essence, steps that countries should already be taking to 
spur sustainability-oriented innovation could help attract the diaspora, thereby creating a 
virtuous cycle.

Education

Education can play multiple roles in a G-NIS. It can influence consumption choices and 
teach consumers about the environment; build skills necessary for innovation, technologi-
cal adaptation and the institutional capacity; raise awareness among policymakers; and 
generate positive externalities, such as the positive benefits conferred by educated parents 
(particularly women) on their children (Schultz, 2002).

Building the technological capacities necessary for green innovation requires 
both learning-by-doing and formal education. Countries need to orient their education 
systems towards developing a skills base for innovation across sectors, such as agriculture, 
energy and transportation, and should (as this chapter argues) develop vocational training, 
although the nature of educational reforms will, of course, depend on a country’s eco-
nomic structure, fiscal means and level of development. In addition, non-traditional forms 
of education can increase coordination between educators and firms, as well as enhance 
access to and lower costs of education.

Partnerships with the private sector can help determine the most appropriate 
education  and  training  strategy  for  a  country.  For  example,  in  the  Republic  of  Korea, 
the  partnership  of  the  private  and  public  sectors  played  a  role  in  the  development  of 
Government-led investment in the vocational training system (Hawley, 2007). Similarly, 
Governments in several Latin American countries have forged successful partnerships with 
private companies aimed at improving technical education (Alvarez and others, 1999). 
These partnerships can also help strengthen interactions between agents in the economy.

Education, consumption and environmental behaviour

Information  campaigns  and  civil  society  mobilization  can  raise  public  environmental 
sensitivity  and  responsibility,  and  foster  sustainable  behaviour  in  areas  such  as  energy 
conservation and recycling. Studies have shown that educating consumers regarding their 
energy consumption patterns can reduce consumption (by about 11 per cent in the United 
States, according to one study), by switching from high- to low-energy items (Gardner and 
Stern, 2008).

Education for conservation can have an even greater impact on firms. A United 
Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO)-United Nations Environment 
Programme (UNEP) programme focused on training, awareness creation and policy ad-
vice has led to significant savings by firms through conservation. For example, in Kenya, 
the paper manufacturer Chandaria Industries experienced savings of 40 per cent in energy, 
48 per cent in materials and 181 per cent in water through involvement in the programme.

Carbon  dioxide  (CO2)  emission  intensity  was  reduced  by  28  per  cent,  waste  water  by 
64 per cent and waste intensity by 62 per cent (United Nations Industrial Development 
Organization, 2010).

Formal education

There is some debate regarding whether developing countries should focus their efforts 
on improving primary, secondary or tertiary education. Primary education is critical for 
developing a semi-skilled labour force. In low-income countries with large rural sectors, 
it  can  be  vital  for  equipping  farmers  with  the  basic  skills  necessary  to  their  being  in-
formed  on  and  implementing  sustainable  agricultural  and  forestry  practices.  However, 
while the significance of achieving universal primary education is highlighted by its inclu-
sion as a Millennium Development Goal, secondary, vocational and tertiary education 
are just as important in the field of green technology. Secondary education can provide 
core skills and knowledge needed for countries’ economic growth. Vocational schooling 
can be particularly useful in building technological competencies; successful vocational 
education also provides important links between education and industry. For example, 
in both Bangladesh (see box V.2) and China, the presence of a pool of workers trained in 
vocational schools was instrumental for the development of domestic solar PV industries 
(Gallagher and others, 2011). In Brazil, the National Employers’ Federation is a major 
provider of high-quality training in areas with labour-market shortages.

However, the provision of vocational education can be relatively costly; in sub-
Saharan Africa, for example, it is up to 14 times more expensive than general secondary 
education (Johanson and Adams, 2004). Thus, Governments may benefit from targeted 
interventions in scientific fields. Tertiary education, especially in science and engineering, 
can help countries become globally competitive and build technological capacities (World 
Bank, 2010b).

Recent progress in education in developing countries

An assessment of educational outcomes reveals huge variations among and within coun-
tries at all levels of education. Overall progress towards universal primary education in 
the past decade has been encouraging, with the net enrolment ratio having reached 87 per 
cent at the end of the school year, 2008, in the developing world (table V.1). Nevertheless, 
UNESCO (2011b) estimates that over 50 million children will still be out of school in 
2015 and that in many countries the quality of education remains weak. Despite some im-
provements, secondary school enrolment remains a problem in many developing regions 
(table V.2). Countries vary enormously in respect of coverage of technical and vocational 
education. However, many technical and vocational education programmes suffer from 
underinvestment, poor quality and weak linkage to employment markets. Tertiary enrol-
ment in developing countries has increased, but remains relatively low in many regions, 
with enrolment being only 6 per cent in Africa.

Lower female access to education remains a problem in many parts of the world. 
Although gender disparities have been narrowing in developing countries, they are still 
pronounced in technical and vocational education and in scientific and technical fields in 
tertiary education (Hyde, 1993). On the other hand, in some countries, such as Bangladesh, 
training of women has been critical in building the green technology sector (see box V.2).

The gross enrolment ratio (GER) is defined as total enrolment at a specific level of education: regardless of age, 
expressed as the proportion of the population in the official age group corresponding to this level of education. 
The gross enrolment ratio may exceed 100 per cent because of early or late entry and/or grade repetition.

Innovative approaches to education

There are a host of new mechanisms designed to lower costs and improve access to educa-
tion, many of which can focus on vocational training. These innovative approaches supple-
ment the formal education system and focus on the skills necessary for green jobs.

At the primary level, partnerships connect schools in Africa with the United 
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (United Kingdom of Great Britain and 
Northern Ireland, British Council, 2011). Access to secondary education can be expanded 
through distance learning via television or other media, utilized by many Latin American 
countries (World Bank, 2007b). Costa Rica has focused on vocational training for small 
enterprises through government collaboration with non-governmental organizations and 
businesses in creating a one-year technical vocational degree (Alvarez and others, 1999). 
At the tertiary level, distance learning can drastically lower the cost of high-quality educa-
tion,  as  demonstrated  by  Mexico’s  virtual  Millennium  University  (Alvarez  and  others, 
1999). The use of e-learning programmes and  satellite schools  in  higher education has 
the  added  benefit  of  not  necessitating  the  physical  relocation  of  students  to  developed 
countries and can thereby lower the risk of brain drain. Community learning centres can 
be used to enhance basic education, train teachers, develop local businesses and strengthen 
civil  society,  offer  access  to  information  and  communications  technology  (ICT)  tools, 
and  provide  populations  in  small  villages  with  valuable  information  (United  Nations 
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, 2011a).

In  many  countries,  there  is  a  shortage  of  skilled  labour,  such  as  engineers, 
maintenance staff and site managers in green economy sectors, although the needs vary 
by sector. For example, sustainable agriculture is knowledge-intensive and requires farmer 
training through extension services, farmer field schools and/or adult literacy campaigns, 
as discussed in chapter III.

Green development 
requires effective labour-
market institutions, 
including various forms of 
protection for workers

Labour market policies

Education and training need to be accompanied by labour-market policies that encourage 
an appropriate match between job-seekers and employers. Governments can help facilitate 
labour mobility and job searches through various interventions, including vocational train-
ing, as discussed above, and employment services, competency assessment programmes 
and skills certification (World Bank, 2010b). These policies can have the ancillary benefit 
of leading to increased knowledge spillover and faster technology transfer. Costs associ-
ated with a transition to a green economy, including unemployment arising from the shift 
from high-carbon industries, will need to be minimized through targeted measures such 
as worker retraining, potentially backed by international-level support through develop-
ment assistance, including Aid for Trade.

Building the appropriate skills base for a green economy needs to be accom-
panied by effective labour-market institutions, including various forms of protection for 
workers. Green jobs need to entail decent work, with adequate wages, safe working condi-
tions, job security and worker rights (United Nations Environment Programme, 2008). 
Jobs in some sectors considered green, such as the electronics recycling industry in Asia 
and the biofuel feedstock plantations sector in Latin America, actually expose workers 
to  environmental  and  other  risks.  Recycling,  for  example,  is  an  important  sustainable 
industry in many developing countries: In China, 1.3 million people are employed in the 
formal waste collection system, an additional 2.5 million are informal workers or scrap 
collectors, and as many as 10 million people are involved in other areas of recycling; and in 
Brazil, half a million people are involved in materials collection activities (United Nations 
Environment Programme, 2008). Yet, recycling jobs are often hazardous, with safety and 
environmental rules non-existent. Labour-market institutions and regulations need to ad-
dress these issues.

National policies for green development

Institutions, industrial policies and infrastructure

There are a wide range of institutions and fiscal incentives that can promote or impede 
innovation. Institutions comprise laws, rules and established social and cultural practices 
that affect incentives and behaviour (Edquist, 1997),5 such as patent laws, cap-and-trade 
systems and regulations. As elsewhere in the G-NIS, there should be two-way relationships 
between these elements and the rest of the system. Domestic institutions and existing in-
frastructure set incentives and affect how the actors behave. Infrastructural or institutional 
rigidities that arise can hamper innovation.

Because of the lack of market demand for sustainable technologies, govern-
ment industrial policies designed to stimulate private sector investment need to be at the 
heart of the G-NIS. Such policies treat green economy activities as “infant industries”, 
requiring appropriate support, including regulatory requirements, government procure-
ment,  subsidies  (preferably  performance-related  and  time-bound),  access  to  credit  and, 
possibly, some level of trade protection, as discussed in chapter VI. In many countries, 
public sector investments in infrastructure would be required to support these industrial 
policy  efforts.  In  addition,  the  policy  framework  should  include  a  government  agency 
structure that can facilitate the establishment of stable but flexible institutions.

Regulation

Regulatory mechanisms, such as targets and standards, are often designed as tools to limit 
or prohibit certain forms of behaviour (United Nations Environment Programme, 2011). 
However, regulations should also be designed to be innovation-friendly. Environmental 
regulations, such as limits placed on emissions, pesticides in food, pollution and water 
contamination, have the first-order effect of improving the environment, but can also be 
drivers of domestic demand for green technologies.

Targets are already being utilized in many developing countries. For example, 
renewable energy targets, which set goals for green energy, usually at 5-20 per cent of 
total energy consumption, are used by 45 developing countries (REN21, 2010). However, 
the effectiveness of these targets varies by country, and many countries are likely to miss 
their 2010 targets. An alternative measure used in many countries, particularly those with 
public energy companies, is to mandate energy companies to source a certain percentage 
of energy from renewable sources (Kempener, Diaz Anadon and Condor Tarco, 2010). 
These more direct targets are somewhat easier to manage and enforce.

Standards, including energy-efficiency codes for buildings and air, water, and 
fuel efficiency standards, can create demand for green technologies, while improving the 
environment and health. For example, fuel efficiency standards in China led to the adop-
tion  of  and  improvements  in  fuel  efficiency  technologies  (Gallagher,  2006).  Similarly, 
water safety standards can stimulate the development of systems for safely storing and 
treating water, for example, through waste-water recycling and desalinization, or improve 
on traditional or local-based technologies, such as harvesting rainwater. Such standards 
can be implemented progressively over time if necessary, through regulation that has been 
announced in advance, to give agents time to adjust.

Quantity-based restrictions 
can often reduce risk more 
effectively than price-
related interventions

Industrial policies can 
also be used to accelerate 
changes in behaviour

One effective programme for setting standards has been Japan’s Top Runner 
Programme  for  appliances,  discussed  in  chapter  II.  This  programme  is  based  on  col-
laboration  among  various  actors.  The  most  energy  efficient  product  on  the  market  sets 
the  “Top  Runner  Standard”,  which  all  corresponding  manufacturers  and  products  will 
aim to achieve in the next stage. Energy efficiency standards are then set by the Ministry 
of Economy, Trade and Industry and its advisory committees, comprising representatives 
from academia, industry, consumer groups, local governments and mass media.

Other regulations include outright mandates. For example, the Republic of 
Korea  has  a  policy  of  “extended  producer  responsibility”  which  requires  companies  to 
recycle packaging. This programme has increased recycling by 14 per cent and estimated 
savings by $1.6 billion (United Nations Environment Programme, 2011). Other mandates 
include direct requirements for green technologies. For example, Bangladesh mandates the 
utilization of solar PV in new construction; Israel mandates utilization of solar hot water; 
and other countries, such as Brazil, have mandates for biofuels.

Economists are traditionally partial to price-based mechanisms, such as taxes, 
over quantity-based regulations, such as those mentioned above. However, the case to be 
made for price-based interventions is far from clear-cut, and theoretical work in economics 
has shown that quantity-based restrictions can reduce risk more effectively than price-
related interventions (Stiglitz and others, 2006). Further, quantity-based interventions are 
typically easier to administer than more complex price-based incentives, making them 
particularly useful tools for countries with weak administrative capacity.

Government procurement, subsidies and other incentives

Government procurement, such as purchases of clean bus fleets, is designed to create market 
demand, subsidies and tax credits are designed to lower an investor’s initial investment, while 
feed-in tariffs (FITs) are designed to guarantee a higher return. Many of these instruments 
are already utilized by developing countries. Green investment tax credits are used in 18 
developing countries, public investment is used in 17, while feed-in tariffs, which guarantee 
prices to clean energy producers above the existing market price, are used in 17, including 
Algeria,  Mongolia,  Sri  Lanka  and  Uganda  (REN21,  2010).  Many  of  these  mechanisms 
have been criticized for locking in subsidies that then become politically difficult to remove, 
although putting time limits on them can help reduce this risk somewhat.

Industrial  policies  can  also  be  used  to  accelerate  changes  in  behaviour  and 
practices. If well designed, some of these tools can have multiple benefits. For example, 
paying farmers for carbon sequestration would remove CO2 from the atmosphere (miti-
gation), enhance soil resilience (adaptation) and improve production by improving crop 
yields (Ocampo, 2011a).

Carbon instruments

Another set of instruments are designed to incorporate environmental externalities into 
carbon technologies to “get prices right”, thereby making sustainable technologies more 
competitive with existing technologies. These include cap-and-trade policies and carbon 
taxes. As discussed above, both sets of policies are particularly problematic for poor devel-
oping countries, as the likely increase in energy costs could disrupt economic develop-
ment, at least until new energy sources are available.

National policies for green development  

151

Cap-and-trade is a quantity control, since it limits the amount of carbon that 
firms can produce; but it has been designed to be more in line with market mechanisms 
than the regulatory controls discussed above. The advantage of a cap-and-trade system 
versus priced-based mechanisms, such as a carbon tax, lies in the fact that a cap puts a 
legal limit on pollution, while the tax sets a price under the assumption that quantity will 
adjust, based on the higher price. A carbon tax has the advantage of raising revenue for 
the government. In addition, some studies have indicated that under certain conditions a 
carbon tax is more likely to spur innovation (Scotchmer, 2010).6

Perhaps most importantly, for developing countries without strong administra-
tive capacity, domestic cap-and-trade schemes could be extremely difficult to implement. 
The 2007-2008 financial crisis revealed the ease with which financial markets could be 
manipulated, even in the most advanced markets; hence, the risk of manipulation, market 
failures and distorted incentives would be extremely high in most developing countries. 
Moreover, with respect to getting prices right, it is likely that both carbon taxes and cap-
and-trade programmes would have to be so large as to be politically infeasible (Mowery, 
Nelson and Martin, 2010).

Investment requirements and trade protection

In  addition  to  price  incentives  and  quantity  restrictions,  many  newly  industrialized 
economies used investment requirements and protectionist measures to build and protect 
domestic industries. For example, both India and China adjusted customs duty require-
ments to protect the development of domestic solar and wind industries (Lema and Lema, 
2010). China also imposed investment requirements on FDI, including local content, joint 
venture, local hiring and mandatory seminar requirements, with the goal of encouraging 
technology transfer from foreign to domestic companies (Lewis, 2007a; 2007b).

However, as discussed in chapter VI, these measures, as well as many of the 
quantity and price incentives discussed above, might be considered illegal under World 
Trade  Organization  rules,  which  could  potentially  limit  policy  scope  and  thus  make 
it  difficult  for  developing  countries  to  “catch  up”.  In  fact,  according  to  Gallagher  and 
Shafaeddin (2010, p. 37): “OECD governments have begun to dub China’s policies as 
‘forced transfers’ and have undertaken investigations and task forces in order to eliminate 
or reduce them”. Further, international intellectual property rights can limit technology 
transfer and the ability to engage in domestic innovation, although the extent will depend 
on the economic sectors involved, the economic activities and the level of development, as 
discussed in chapter VI.

Infrastructure and business environment

To spur innovation, industrial policy measures need to be supplemented by public sector 
investment in domestic infrastructure. Such investment can have multiple benefits. For 
example, public sector investment in clean transportation or in energy, water and sanita-
tion services can reduce poverty, improve health and create a better investment climate.

6

According to Scotchmer, when the demand for energy is inelastic, cap-and-trade regulation may 
lead to incomplete diffusion of a new technology, whereas tax regulation offers an incentive to 
fully diffuse the innovation.

Countries can support 
business incubators and 
technology transfer centres

Innovation and entrepreneurial activity also require facilities, legal and busi-
nesses services, and access to telecommunications services. An alternative for countries 
that do not have a supportive infrastructure is to build business incubators and technology 
transfer centres capable of providing these services. These can be either independent or 
structured as elements in a science park, as is the case in Tunisia (World Bank, 2010b).

A second important element is the nature of the business environment, which 
is  influenced  by  the  extent  to  which  bureaucracy  impacts  the  ease  of  doing  business. 
Although every context differs, in general, the government should focus on reducing the 
red tape that unnecessarily impedes entrepreneurship, while distinguishing between those 
regulations that serve a purpose and those that simply foster inefficiency. For example, 
investors might view regulations that require documentation of environmental risks as 
being simply red tape, even though these regulations are a necessary element of a country’s 
regulatory framework.

Government agencies

Institutions in many countries, such as those in Africa, are subject to rigidities, which 
make it difficult for them to respond to the changing needs of a developing economy’s 
innovation system (Oyelaran-Oyeyinka, 2005). While overcoming institutional rigidities 
can be difficult, a government agency structure that is designed to promote innovation can 
better manage a G-NIS and thus help overcome some of these obstacles.

The goal is to leave in place 
the flexibility of a diffused 
governmental organization, 
while maintaining 
coordination

The  Economic  Commission  for  Africa  (ECA)  (United  Nations,  Economic 
Commission for Africa, 2007) identified three types of structures for government agencies: 
pluralist,  coordinated  and  centralist.  Pluralist  structures  have  independent  government 
agencies  and  ministries  with  no  coordinating  mechanism,  an  arrangement  that  could 
lead to a high cost in terms of overlap and gaps. In the coordinated system, government 
departments initiate their own programmes, but a coordinating body nevertheless exists. 
This type of structure has tended to lead to rivalries among ministries and its effectiveness 
is being called into question by many of the OECD countries that have utilized it. In 
a centralist system, the full range of green technological projects and issues are coordi-
nated by a single ministry. An inter-ministerial committee formulates policy, approves the 
technology budget and oversees all decisions related to technology policy. The goal is to 
leave in place the flexibility of a diffused governmental organization, while maintaining a 
central coordinating body.

The Economic Commission for Africa (United Nations, Economic Commission 
for Africa, 2007) concluded that the centralist system is the most appropriate structure for 
developing countries, such as those in Africa. Given that a G-NIS is a complex system, a 
coordinating body is likely to play an important role in designing policy. However, in a 
G-NIS framework, it is important to include all key stakeholders in the design process, 
including  the  private  sector  and  civil  society.  There  is  no  one-size-fits-all  solution,  and 
which structure is most relevant will depend on the specifics of the country.

Whatever structure is chosen needs to be coupled with mechanisms for moni-
toring and evaluation so as to limit the capture of politicians by the private sector. It is 
also important to ensure the connection between the coordinating body and the highest 
political authorities, since without a strong visible political commitment, short-term ur-
gent priorities in other areas can displace attention and resources.

National policies for green development  

153

Financing

One  of  the  most  important  functions  of  the  G-NIS  is  to  mobilize  the  capital  needed 
to  finance  innovation.  In  theory,  the  government  would  finance  public  goods,  such  as 
infrastructure and possibly education, and leave the rest to the private sector. However, as 
discussed earlier, the lines blur with regard to investments in innovation of green technolo-
gies because of their status as public goods.

Which source of financing makes the most sense for a country will depend on 
its financial market structure and the level of risk in the project. There are also interna-
tional public funds available to help countries finance investments in green technologies, 
including through the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change,7 the 
World Bank Group, and other sources of aid as discussed in chapter VI.

Private sector green funds

So-called green funds are mutual funds and hedge funds that invest in sustainable tech-
nologies. However, these funds tend to be myopic and extremely pro-cyclical, increasing 
during boom periods and falling during economic downturns. This is partly because the 
fund managers themselves are short-sighted, and partly because their own funding sources 
tend to grow during boom periods and collapse during economic recessions (Stiglitz and 
others, 2006). For example, investors redeemed $1.2 billion from renewable energy funds 
in the first 10 months of 2010 as changes in regulation and the credit crunch dimmed the 
outlook for solar and wind projects, after those funds had grown by $1.2 billion in 2009 
(Sills, 2010). In essence, these funds are green hot money and Governments should be 
wary of the type of financing they offer.

Venture capital

Venture  capital  (VC)  is  the  form  of  financing  typically  used  in  the  diffusion  stage  of 
the innovation process, not least because many venture capitalists can assist in business 
development. Unlike green funds, VC tends to have relatively long lock-ups, meaning that 
investors cannot withdraw their investments for a period of 7-10 years.8 Generally, VC has 
not been available for investments in green technologies in developing countries owing to 
the high risks involved, as discussed above. Although a significant amount of VC had been 
raised for investments in green technology prior to the financial market crisis, most of the 
funds were invested in developed countries. Approximately one quarter of the funds were 
never deployed at all, because green investments had been viewed as too risky—even in 
developed countries (World Bank, 2010b).

Microfinance institutions and microfinance

Microfinance can play a role in reaching rural populations which currently lack access 
to electricity, clean water and cooking stoves. Microfinance and micro-consignment9 are

Nonetheless  there  is  evidence  that  investments  of  venture  capital  in  R&D  are  somewhat  pro-
cyclical (Barlevy and Tsiddon, 2006; Ouyang, 2009).
In  micro-consignment,  the  consumer  pays  off  the  price  of  the  product  over  time,  with  the 
distributor owning the product until it is fully paid off.

also  successfully  set  up  subsidiary  companies  which  use  their  microcredit  networks  to 
extend  loans  for  clean  energy  products,  such  as  off-grid  solar  systems,  as  discussed  in 
box V.2. Much of the financing for these loans comes from banks set up by government 
or multilateral institutions. Similarly, Sri Lanka’s renewable energy project is based on a 
network of microfinance institutions that work with solar companies (REN21, 2010).

Foreign direct investment

FDI can be a source of long-term investment. Although there is evidence that FDI is also 
somewhat pro-cyclical (Stiglitz and others, 2006), it is significantly less so than portfolio 
investment. However, as discussed above, to be effective in technology transfer, FDI needs 
be supplemented by domestic policies designed to encourage knowledge spillovers.

Long-term institutional investors

Several large public 
pension funds and 
sovereign wealth funds 
have begun to invest in 
clean energy projects

Long-term  investors  include  domestic  and  international  pension  funds,  as  well  as  sov-
ereign wealth funds (SWFs).10 Although funds differ, all of these investors tend to have 
relatively  long  investment-horizons,  and  can,  to  some  extent,  avoid  succumbing  to  the 
myopia discussed above. In addition, because SWFs and public pension funds represent 
citizens, many of them are conscious of the need to behave in a socially responsible way: 
green  investments  can  enhance  their  legitimacy  and  reputation  in  this  regard  (Bolton, 
Guesnerie and Samama, 2010).

Pension funds tend to be relatively conservative investors, since their liability 
structure  is  based  on  future  payments  to  pensioners,  which  are  meant  to  be  relatively 
stable. Therefore, it could be difficult for pension funds to invest in the earlier stages of 
green technological innovation in developing countries, owing to the high uncertainty 
associated  with  many  of  the  projects.  Nonetheless,  several  large  public  pension  funds, 
such as the public sector funds of Canada and the Netherlands, have begun to invest in 
clean energy projects. Government policies that emphasize risk-sharing policies could be 
particularly important for these investors.

Moreover,  several  SWFs  have  also  already  made  significant  green  invest-
ments. Most SWFs have a mandate to preserve and transfer wealth to future generations. 
Therefore, green investments make sense to them from an asset-liability perspective, since 
the risks associated with climate change can be seen as a potential liability to nation States 
(Bolton, Guesnerie and Samama, 2010).

Private and public sector risk-sharing

There is enormous 
uncertainty associated with 
the innovation process 
and the lack of markets for 
many green products

As  the  above  analysis  makes  clear,  the  main  impediments  to  private  sector  investment 
in green innovation are the enormous uncertainty associated with the innovation proc-
ess and the lack of markets for many green products. Mechanisms designed to facilitate 

10

However,  many  seemingly  long-term  investors,  such  as  pension  funds  (both  domestic  and 
international), manage their investment with a short-term bias.

National policies for green development

sharing of risk between the government and the private sector can be used to overcome 
these impediments to some degree. These include traditional forms of risk-sharing, such as 
public-private partnerships, as well as more innovative mechanisms, such as equity-linked 
financing, rural funds and national green long-horizon funds.

Public-private partnerships (PPP) and development banks

Both the government and the private sector invest jointly in public-private partnerships, 
and share the costs of the projects. In the United States, public-private partnerships are an 
important component of government innovation policy (Audretsch, Link and Scott, 2002) 
and have been particularly helpful in overcoming the risks associated with the introduction 
of new technologies into the market. A prominent example is the 1986 United States Clean 
Coal Technology Program, which was created to address the acid rain problem. The in-
dustry covered almost two thirds of the project costs, and a Department of Energy (DOE) 
study found that “cost sharing between (the) DOE and industrial collaborators frequently 
improved the performance of RD&D programs and enhanced the level of economic and 
other benefits associated with such programs” (National Research Council, 2001).

Public sector development banks provide an alternative funding channel for 
long-term investment in many developing countries. Development banks have been im-
portant  in  Brazil,  China  and  India,  particularly  in  infrastructure.  Local  public  banks, 
often dedicated to financing rural projects, are one such source of financing. These banks 
usually  lend  through  private  companies,  non-governmental  organizations  and  microfi-
nance groups and, more recently, have lent through rural energy funds. In the case of both 
public-private partnerships and development banks, it is important that mechanisms be 
set up to judge their effectiveness and minimize potential abuse.

Rural renewable energy funds

Rural energy funds have been set up in countries such as Bangladesh, Mali, Senegal and 
Sri  Lanka  (REN21,  2010).  These  funds  have  the  triple  advantage  of  reducing  poverty, 
improving infrastructure (including access to electricity) and stimulating investment in 
green technological adaptation and diffusion. Rural funds tend to combine financing with 
advice on engineering, project management and feasibility studies.

Equity-linked financing

Many government policies discussed in this chapter and elsewhere, such as government 
subsidies, tax breaks and low-interest loans, are transfers from the government to private 
sector firms, meant to “crowd in” private investment. In essence, taxpayers subsidize pri-
vate sector activity, but if the firm succeeds, the entrepreneurs earn all the profits.

Risk-linked  financing  provides  an  alternative  to  outright  grants  or  low-
interest loans. Similar to a gross domestic product (GDP)-linked bond (Griffiths-Jones 
and Sharma, 2006), equity-linked loans or bonds allow the lender (in this case, the gov-
ernment) to share in the potential upside of successful projects.11 If the firm fails, the 

11

The financing could be structured as a loan (with non-voting equity warrants attached), whose 
repayment would be based on the success of the venture. In the event of success, the firms’ owners 
could buy out the government’s stake at a price on the basis of pre-agreed rules.

country’s taxpayers lose their investment—but that loss is similar to what they would have 
paid out in traditional subsidies; however, if the firm succeeds, the government will have 
a financial stake in the firm and the taxpayers will be compensated for the risks they have 
taken. These are relatively simple structures that can provide low-risk financing for firms, 
while still ensuring that taxpayers are compensated for their investments.

National green long-horizon funds

National green long-horizon 
funds can be set up to enable 
the sharing of risk between 
the public and private sectors 
and the “crowding in” of 
private investment

Much attention has been focused on global funds for clean technology, which constitute 
an important part of the global effort to combat climate change, as discussed in chapter 
VI. From a domestic perspective, long-horizon domestic clean energy funds could be part 
of the G-NIS framework. Such funds would raise capital from long-term investors. One 
unique aspect of the structure is that the investors with shorter time-horizons would not 
be  allowed  to  participate  in  the  fund.12  The  government  would  either  invest  alongside 
private investors, or give a guarantee and put up a fraction of the capital. Either way, the 
government would maintain some equity in the fund to compensate for its share of the 
risk-taking, so that taxpayers could earn returns on the investments.

Investors would likely be drawn to the fund for several reasons.13 First, they 
would have a stake in a field with enormous potential, but with reduced risk. Second, with 
the government taking the same risks as the investor, the government and investors’ inter-
ests would be more or less aligned, thereby making it much less likely that the government 
would put in place policies that harm the fund’s investments. Thus, one type of political 
risk usually faced by investors would be removed. Third, because Governments establish 
the regulatory and policy framework, they tend to have inside knowledge of what type of 
projects makes the most sense for their country. This is particularly relevant in the case of 
green technologies where market demand is primarily determined by government policies, 
thereby making the government a valuable co-investor.

The government can also derive several advantages from this type of structure. 
First, the government can leverage its own investments and attract investors who normally 
might not invest in the early phases of the innovation process. Second, the fund would likely 
be off balance sheet, since, for accounting purposes, it would be treated as an investment 
rather than as an expenditure. The implication is that it would not affect the budget, and 
the government could possibly issue “green bonds” to finance additional projects. Third, the 
fund—unlike the usual fiscal incentives, many of which are giveaways to investors—would 
enable the government to keep an equity stake in the projects it finances.

The investment strategy of the fund would focus on innovation. Nevertheless, 
the question still remains, how will the fund go about choosing which investments to 
finance?  The  answer  to  this  question  is  particularly  significant  in  the  present  context, 
because it offers insights relevant to the broader question of how a government should go 
about choosing its investments.

As the fund will invest in direct equity, the existence of a well-developed bond or equity market 
would not be a prerequisite for its workability.

Policy implications
A framework for government decision-making

There is a continuing debate on how a government should intervene in markets. Some 
argue, pointing to the success of East Asia, that government should select or target par-
ticular activities or firms. Others point to government failures, and argue that government 
interventions are meant to improve markets without favouring specific activities (Lall and 
Teubal, 1998), such as by setting standards and letting the private sector make the decision 
on how best to meet those standards. Yet, while standards are an important tool, they 
are unlikely, as discussed above, to be sufficient to spur innovation of green technologies 
to the extent necessary. Without other forms of government support, it is unlikely that 
clean technology markets will develop; thus, Governments still need to subsidize green 
technologies. Hence the question remains, how does the government choose which tech-
nologies or sectors are to be subsidized?

The  objectives  of  the  G-NIS  suggest  several  general  guidelines.  First,  the 
government should commit to sustainably oriented investments. Second, it should give 
priority to investments in infrastructure that might be critical to “crowding in” private 
investment. Third, it should look to investments that have positive externalities elsewhere 
in the system, with higher potential for learning spillovers. While a more detailed answer 
to the question will inevitably depend on the specific characteristics of a country, this 
chapter sets out a framework for responding to it through use of an analogy to financial 
asset management (which is one reason that the fund construct above is so useful).

When it has unique insight 
into the appropriateness 
of certain investments, 
a Government should 
take advantage of that 
knowledge to direct 
investment choices

Grübler and others (forthcoming bis) have suggested that Governments should 
create a diversified portfolio comprising a blend of technologies, based on a granular approach, 
which spreads risk across a broad range of smaller-scale innovations without the Government’s 
being required to make premature selections of a few capital-intensive projects. However, 
larger projects are sometimes the most appropriate, especially for small economies and de-
veloping countries, and the small, diversified approach would preclude this option. Further, 
a diversified portfolio is the best approach for investing only if the following conditions are 
satisfied: (a) the returns of the investments are uncorrelated, and (b) the investor does not 
have any unique knowledge or comparative advantage over other investors. If an investor has 
unique knowledge, it is likely more profitable to invest on that information than to diversify. 
Venture capitalists invest all the time in more concentrated portfolios while still maintaining 
a degree of diversification across multiple investments. Many of these investments are in fact 
based on educated guesses regarding what government policy will look like.

Similarly, when a government or a non-governmental organization has unique 
insight, like the Government of Brazil in respect of sugar and biofuels or Grameen on the 
potential for solar in rural Bangladesh, it can—and should—take advantage of that knowl-
edge. More broadly, a diversified index fund approach makes sense when a Government 
does not have unique insight; a more concentrated venture capital-type approach (which 
nonetheless still maintains some degree of diversification) makes sense when the govern-
ment does have that insight.

Building insight at the government level is, of course, not always straightfor-
ward. Government learning is an interactive process based on experimentation. Feedback 
from private sector innovators, research labs, suppliers and demanders are a crucial part of 
the decision-making process. The G-NIS emphasizes the importance of interaction between 
policymakers and the private sector, universities, and research institutes, which can further

enhance government decision-making. Furthermore, most Governments know more than 
any other actors about future regulatory structure, legal framework and players in the sys-
tem, and often have more information on various existing projects in relevant sectors.

As in the private sector, not all government investments will be profitable and 
some will fail. After all, more than 50 per cent of new businesses in the United States fail 
in the first four years of their existence (Shane, 2008). Successful venture capitalists are 
right only part of the time,14 while the gains of the winners compensate for the failures of 
the losers. However, particular investment failures do not mean that the strategy itself is 
a failure. It is important to change perceptions of the meaning of government failure. A 
country fund structure, as discussed above, could be helpful in doing so, since it incorpo-
rates individual decisions into a larger framework. In addition, as the fund would likely 
be managed by an independent manager, it could also help address some of the issues 
associated with government mismanagement.

Nonetheless, government failures do exist, owing to mismanagement, incom-
petence and/or fraud. History has shown that without a strong governance structure, gov-
ernment programmes can become riddled with favouritism and cronyism. Well-structured 
rules for assessment and monitoring investments are a crucial element in the innovation 
process. In the newly industrialized countries in Asia, for example, effective policies were 
linked  to  mechanisms  set  up  to  judge  their  effectiveness,  with  a  flexible  policy  regime 
capable of adapting to failed policies (Kim and Nelson, eds., 2000). Implementing such a 
strategy is no doubt difficult, but improvements in the structure of government agencies 
can be a step in the desired direction.

Policy reforms under the G-NIS

Strong  technology  and  innovation  policies  are  needed  to  meet  the  challenges  associ-
ated with achieving sustainable green growth. The G-NIS provides a coherent systemic 
framework for understanding innovation policy. Policies within the G-NIS should correct 
inefficiencies in the system, rather than specific market failures. For example, if systemic in-
efficiency is due to a lack of coordination between universities and firms, the Government 
might offer grants for joint R&D, deploy the funds needed to start a science park and/or 
encourage mobility between research institutions and firms.

Nonetheless, one size does not fit all, and policy choices will depend on the 
specificities of a country, including the level of development and administrative capacity. 
Table V.3 sums up many of the policy measures discussed throughout this chapter and pro-
vides some general examples of how policies might apply to countries with weak, medium 
and strong administrative and innovative capacity. Overall, policies in the G-NIS should 
promote technological capacity-building, technological transfer, interactive learning and 
entrepreneurship based on education, knowledge spillovers and learning-by-doing.

Industrial policies are at the heart of the G-NIS. There will, of course, be some 
failures associated with these policies, but it is time to reassess the meaning of government 
failure so as to judge government performance from a broader perspective—one that is 
focused on the importance of building long-term sustainable green growth.

14

Some  estimates  put  the  proportion  of  the  time  that  successful  venture  capitalists  are  correct 
at as low as 10 per cent (Grübler and others, forthcoming bis). Based on back-of-the-envelope 
estimates, the figure, while possibly higher than 10 per cent, is likely less than 50 per cent.

Summary
A sustained scaling up and reform in international cooperation and finance are required to achieve 
the  global  technological  revolution.  Within  the  next  three  to  four  decades,  individual-country 
efforts and efforts undertaken across the various areas of technology will need to “add up” to the 
global requirements for reducing environmental degradation while increasing human economic 
activity in pursuit of eliminating poverty. 
Green industries can be considered infant industries. Restoring State capacities for technological 
development, particularly in developing countries, is critical. Multilateral trade disciplines, which now 
heavily restrict industrial development, need to be reformed to enable the promotion of economic 
activities based on green technologies in a fair manner among all countries.
Creating a publicly led global technology sharing regime and building networks of international 
technology research and application centres will be indispensable. To achieve the global objective 
of rapid technological diffusion, a greater variety of multilateral intellectual property modalities 
will have to be deployed.
To  facilitate  the  introduction  of  the  new  green  technologies,  investment  rates  in  developing 
countries will have to be raised by at least 2-4 per cent and sustained at the higher level over 
the next four decades. Affording developing countries macroeconomic policy space is necessary 
for  achieving  higher  investment  rates  needed  for  sustainable  development.  This  will  require 
improved financial regulation coordination, effective controls over volatile private capital flows, 
and strengthened international financing mechanisms for long-term investments and for external 
shocks.

Two key global challenges

As  discussed  in  previous  chapters,  effective  national  education  and  innovation  systems 
must match and build upon existing local conditions. It is expected that a great variety 
of national strategies and institutional approaches will emerge. The present chapter evalu-
ates the global regime that will be required to advance and sustain these diverse national 
approaches.

Significant  and  sustained  upgrading  of  developing-country  technological 
capabilities is a necessary ingredient in achieving sustainable development. At the inter-
national level, there are two interrelated challenges associated with achieving this end. 
The first challenge is to ensure that technological development and diffusion induced by 
individual-country Government and private sector efforts “add up”; that is, they need to

Significant reforms in

international trade, aid, 
finance and technology-
sharing are needed

induce sufficient progress towards sustainable development goals by making energy sys-
tems low on carbon emissions, producing more energy-efficient and less waste-generating 
appliances, and ensuring food security through sustainable agricultural production meth-
ods. International mechanisms must be able to aggregate the expected variety of country 
strategies. Much-strengthened international mechanisms for technological and industrial 
evaluation, planning, stimulation and cooperation will be needed. Multiple stakeholders, 
including Governments, private sector agents, the scientific community and other parts of 
civil society, will need to be held accountable for their actions and commitments through 
adequate monitoring systems.

The second challenge is to unleash from individual countries the actions and 
creativity needed to meet the global goals of poverty reduction and environmental sustain-
ability. At present, the multilateral trading system and bilateral and regional free trade 
agreements and investment treaties erect barriers that constrain national innovation and 
industrial  development.  Significant  reforms  in  existing  mechanisms  related  to  interna-
tional trade, aid, finance and technology-sharing are needed. It will also require expanded 
investment and financial flows and technological cooperation. International rules should 
facilitate developing countries’ ability to incorporate green technological development into 
their own national development strategies.

The  body  of  the  chapter  begins  with  a  brief  description  of  the  bases  of  in-
ternational cooperation in sustainable development and technological development and 
diffusion, followed by a discussion of the challenges related to ensuring that the efforts 
of individual stakeholders indeed add up to the achievement of sustainable development 
goals. The chapter then examines existing deficiencies in multilateral arrangements and 
concludes with a consideration of the reforms needed to overcome these deficiencies.

Global sustainable development commitments

Expanding action towards nurturing and upgrading green production and consumption 
technologies in developing countries must be a priority of international cooperation. In 
the context of the climate challenge, the Expert Group on Technology Transfer under the 
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change1 (United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change, Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice, 
2009, para. 216) summarized the problem as follows: “The implementation challenge is to 
stimulate the development of a continuously changing set of technologies (currently con-
sisting of approximately 147 mitigation technologies and 165 technologies for adaptation) 
that are at different stages of technological maturity and have different requirements for 
further development. Those technologies need to be adapted for, and transferred to, about 
150 developing countries, each with its own needs for specific technologies and enabling 
environments to support them.”

It  is  noteworthy  that  since  1992,  pursuant  to  the  adoption  of  Agenda  21 
(United  Nations,  1993),  one  of  the  outcomes  of  the  United  Nations  Conference  on 
Environment and Development (the “Earth Summit”), held in Rio de Janeiro in June 
1992, proposals to reorient the global technological regime towards diffusion shaped by 
public goals have been justified on the grounds of poverty eradication and environmental 
sustainability. Agenda 21 embodied a political commitment based on principles—not ac-
tion. This political commitment has been reaffirmed in subsequent political agreements.

The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, an agreement focused 
on the shared State responsibilities in response to the challenge of climate change (un-
like  Agenda  21  which  focused  on  development-related  responsibilities),  reiterates  the 
commitment  in  its  article  4,  which  states  that  “(T)he  developed  country  Parties  and 
other developed Parties included in Annex II shall take all practicable steps to promote, 
facilitate and finance, as appropriate, the transfer of, or access to, environmentally sound 
technologies” (para. 5).

Chapter 34 of Agenda 21, entitled “Transfer of environmentally sound tech-
nology,  cooperation  and  capacity-building”,  contains  the  earliest  reference  to  the  issue 
and sets out the key parameters involved. It identifies the “need for favourable access to 
and transfer of environmentally sound technologies, in particular to developing countries, 
through supportive measures that promote technology cooperation and that should enable 
transfer of necessary technological know-how as well as building up of economic, techni-
cal, and managerial capabilities for the efficient use and further development of transferred 
technology”; and calls on Governments, the private sector and research institutes to play 
their role in technology transfer, while recognizing the role of long-term partnerships in 
systematic training and capacity-building at all levels (para. 34.4).

An important precedent for action in the realm of international technological 
diffusion has been provided under the auspices of the Consultative Group on International 
Agricultural Research (CGIAR) (as discussed in chap. III), which supported research in and 
application of innovative food production technologies as a response to the perceived danger 
of the outstripping of food production by population growth. The CGIAR created technol-
ogy intended for the public domain (even though it had been financed originally by private 
foundations) and in this regard established many important models of cooperative global 
technology regimes, placing a special emphasis on the needs of developing countries.

Public interventions must 
be directed at accelerating 
and scaling up research 
and diffusion of green 
technology more broadly

Do stakeholders’ actions towards sustainable 
development add up?

Since the Earth Summit, there has been a growing body of multilateral technology transfer 
commitments driven by the goal of sustainable development and reflecting an important 
emerging international understanding that, at the international level, greater public sector 
involvement in technology development and diffusion is indispensable. The challenge lies 
in how to mobilize all stakeholders to deliver on these commitments and how to ensure 
their actions and initiatives add up so as to ensure that sustainable development objectives 
will be achieved. At the international level, public interventions have to be directed at ac-
celerating and scaling up research and diffusion of green technology more broadly in order 
to (a) reverse the situation in respect of the status of change in energy technology, which 
has remained at the level of the global fuel mix of the 1970s; (b) restore land productivity 
while increasing food production; and (c) reduce human harm from increasingly extreme 
natural events, as discussed in chapters II, III and IV, respectively.

For mitigation technology in particular, an interim report of the Chair of the 
above-mentioned  Expert  Group  on  Technology  Transfer  (United  Nations  Framework 
Convention on Climate Change, Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice, 
and Subsidiary Body for Implementation, 2008) provides an estimate of the relative im-
pact of various sectors (table VI.1). Reducing greenhouse gas emissions caused by energy 
use  (see  chap.  II)  and  forestry  (discussed  under  land  management  in  chap.  III)  makes

all of the agricultural technologies, are in the deployment stage of technological maturity. 
As discussed in chapter III, the technological deployment effort will require public sector 
support and is best directed at smallholder farmers. While the transport sector, which 
is a key energy end-user (chap. II), has the greatest number of technologies at the very 
basic research maturity stage compared with other sectors, some of those technologies are 
already commercially viable, implying that the rapid adoption of mature transportation 
technologies can yield quick results.

Upgrading agricultural technology will be critical in reducing GHG emissions 
from that sector (chap. III) while increasing food production by 70-100 per cent by 2050. 
New technologies in energy-efficient buildings more resilient to extreme weather events 
can contribute between 2 and 40 per cent to emissions reductions (table VI.1).

Private-public sector roles in technology  
development and diffusion

Because the challenge is to widely test, diffuse and scale up green technologies, private sec-
tor participation is critical. Maintaining stable incentives through long-term public policy 
is indispensable for private investment and risk-taking in green technology. The recent 
volatility in the prices of crude oil and carbon permits are not conducive to beneficial 
private risk-taking.

The role of advanced economies through a combination of their own tax and 
regulatory policies will be crucial in sustaining stable international prices for green tech-
nology development and deployment; increased technological deployment will stimulate 
further private sector technical innovation. Chapter V discussed how national develop-
ment strategies and innovation systems can accelerate the shift towards the adoption of 
green technologies in order to meet sustainable development objectives. One of the roles 

Increased technological 
deployment stimulates

Building a global technology development and sharing regime 

165

of the proposed national innovation system (G-NIS), presented in chapter V, is “market 
formation” through policies such as public procurement and investment risk-sharing to 
stimulate private investment in the scaling up of applications of new technologies until 
they become cost-competitive with old technologies.

Technology development and diffusion of industrialized  
and developing countries must add up

For green technologies that are already commercially competitive or almost competitive, 
the public sector role at the international level must be to ensure that developing countries 
are able to deploy these technologies at a speed and scale consistent with their development 
needs and the global community’s sustainable development objectives. A key public inter-
vention is adequate and stable development financing for deployment of such technologies. 
The growing international cooperation in establishing innovative sources of development 
financing can be a stable, long-term and less politically contingent basis of such financ-
ing  (see  United  Nations,  General  Assembly,  2009).  Proposed  charges  on  international 
transportation, for example, might be able to ensure both carbon efficiency and revenue 
benefits (United Nations, 2010a).

While  some  large  emerging  market  economies,  such  as  India,  China  and 
Brazil, appear able to undertake the required technological effort on their own and are 
already competing with industrialized countries, the overwhelming majority of develop-
ing countries are not in the same situation. If the international technological development 
and diffusion regime is to promote sustainable development, its rules and mechanisms will 
have to ensure affordable access to new green technologies as a developmental imperative.
Public financing will help increase the size of the market and thereby spur private 
companies to increase scale and continue to drive costs lower. Public action is also needed 
to ensure that critical new technology is available at reasonable cost. Technologies should be 
purchased at prices comparable with those of risky projects over extended time periods. The 
implications for the multilateral intellectual property regime are discussed further below.

Cooperative international scientific  
efforts need to be scaled up

Strengthening and configuring the role of the international public sector in promoting 
development of as yet non-commercial technologies constitute an urgent priority. Indeed, 
there exist a variety of separate technologies that offer large possibilities for crossovers and 
joint development. There are a variety of key players from among Governments, academia 
and research institutions, and private companies that compete and coordinate based on 
individual self-interest.

The  precedents  set  by  the  work  of  the  Intergovernmental  Panel  on  Climate 
Change  (IPCC),  the  United  Nations  Framework  Convention  on  Climate  Change  and 
players within the international arena of civil society groups provide the international com-
munity with a body of knowledge and methods of reaching consensus on technical issues. 
While these achievements are directly related to climate change and reflect only a subset of 
all green economy-building goals, they do encompass all the key technological sectors whose 
efforts are required for sustainable development. The issue is how to translate the outcomes 
of this form of “knowledge consolidation and validation” into guides for concrete action.

Governments should facilitate the creation of multi-country working bodies 
whose membership would be drawn from officials, academia and the private sector and 
whose aim would be to identify policies for, and approaches to, accelerated international 
technological diffusion and sharing in specific areas of technology. Each of these bodies 
could sustain an international network of experts with the capacity to undertake technol-
ogy assessments, including the identification of areas where additional funding would 
be required and where changes in public policy—entailing, for example, placement of 
certain technologies in the public domain—would be appropriate. Applying the model 
of the CGIAR, these networks would raise funds and accept funding from public and 
private  donors  to  finance  research,  experimentation  and  deployment.  The  Framework 
Convention Expert Group on Technology Transfer provides a template for this kind of 
effort (box VI.1).

Expert Group on Technology Transfer

The Expert Group on Technology Transfer was established in 2001 by the Conference of the Parties 
to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change as an institutional arrangement 
whose  purpose  would  be  to  facilitate  the  implementation  of  the  technology  transfer  framework 
provided by the Marrakesh Accords.a The Expert Group keeps the Conference of the Parties informed 
on the status and progress of its work in annual reports; and over the years, it has produced targeted 
and instructive products which the Conference of the Parties can use in formulating specific climate 
change mitigation and adaptation technology strategies.

According to its terms of reference, the Expert Group organizes workshops and prepares 
technical papers, reports and handbooks that analyse and identify ways of facilitating and advancing 
technology transfer activities. Based on these activities, the Expert Group makes recommendations 
to the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA).

One of the Expert Group’s emerging work areas related to mechanisms for technology 
transfer encompasses innovative options for financing the development and transfer of technologies. 
A major output of the work in this area has been a practitioners’ guidebook designed to assist project 
developers in developing countries in preparing project proposals that will meet the standards of 
international finance providers.

The focus of another important work area is the development of tools that can support 
countries in meeting their special needs for adaptation to climate change. A major output has been 
a background paper that sets out the lessons learned in specific sectors (coastal zones, water re-
sources, agriculture, public health and infrastructure), including 15 case studies. The report highlights 
potential policy recommendations for strengthening the transfer of technologies for adaptation.

Pursuant to its reconstitution at the thirteenth session of the Conference of the Parties 
to the Framework Convention within the context of implementing the Bali Action Plan,b the strength-
ened Expert Group elaborated a programme of work for 2008-2009 that included the identification 
of  mechanisms  for  technology  transfer,  including  innovative  financing,  cooperation  with  relevant 
conventions and intergovernmental processes, endogenous development of technology and col-
laborative R&D of technologies.

In Bali, the Conference of the Parties at its thirteenth session was requested to develop, 
as part of its future programme of work, a set of performance indicators that could be used by the 
Subsidiary Body for Implementation to regularly monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of imple-
mentation of the technology transfer framework for meaningful and effective actions to enhance 
the  implementation  of  article  4.5  of  the  Framework  Convention.  The  work  comprises  three  tasks: 
developing  a  set  of  candidate  performance  indicators,  testing  the  set  of  performance  indicators, 
and preparing recommendations for their use (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
Change, Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice, 2008). The performance indicator 
system will serve as a methodological mechanism for evaluating and monitoring the development 
and transfer of environmentally sound technologies.

Deficiencies of existing mechanisms

Sustainable  development  is  unattainable  within  the  existing  international  frameworks. 
To achieve this goal, all efforts need to yield (or “add up” to) the necessary technological 
changes in energy and transport, in agriculture and land management, and in disaster risk 
reduction management, as elaborated in previous chapters. Five key constraints on the 
effort required have to be overcome.

Private investment-dependent technological 
diffusion would be too slow

Currently, an overwhelming proportion of environmental technology is in private hands 
(including in universities, which have become dependent on intellectual property income in 
recent decades). Technology transfer relies heavily on foreign direct investment (FDI) flows, 
technical cooperation provisions in external assistance grants and loans and export credit 
agency financing. The newer green technologies are characterized by a higher cost of opera-
tion relative to existing technologies and will tend to incur additional costs specific to their 
deployment in developing countries because of domestic deficiencies in human skills and 
infrastructure ascribable to dependence on older technology. Chapter V highlighted the fact 
that, because technological development is path-dependent, the public sector has consistently 
played an indispensable role in inducing and facilitating large technological shifts. Because 
protection of the natural environment is a public good, there is an obvious justification for 
strong technology and industrial policies and one cannot expect freely operating markets to 
provide the right incentives conducive to large-scale investment in green technologies.

Under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the 
five key elements underpinning the framework “for meaningful and effective actions” in 
implementing technology transfer entail a strong role for the public sector. The elements 
identified are: (a) technology needs assessments; (b) technology information; (c) enabling 
environments; (d) capacity-building; and (e) mechanisms to facilitate institutional and fi-
nancial support for technology cooperation, development and transfer. In actual practice: 

(T)he focus of implementation has generally been on creating conditions 
in developing countries conducive to foreign investment and building 
capabilities to absorb and utilize imported technologies. Less emphasis 
has been placed on measures which governments of technology supplier 
countries  can  and  should  take  to  facilitate  and  accelerate  technology 
transfer. Nor, until now, have there been effective methods of measuring 
and verifying the extent of environmentally sound technology transfer.2
The dependence on private transfers makes the international intellectual prop-
erty regime a potentially decisive determinant of technological upgrading in developing 
countries. A multilateral intellectual property regime emerged in the 1990s within the 
framework  of  the  Agreement  on  Trade-related  Aspects  of  Intellectual  Property  Rights 
(TRIPS)  regime  of  the  World  Trade  Organization  (World  Trade  Organization,  1994) 
and  numerous  bilateral  and  regional  trade  and  investment  treaties.  Operationally,  the 
TRIPS  Agreement  encompasses  the  recognition  and  enforcement  of  nationally  created 
private intellectual property rights by World Trade Organization member States. Least 
developed countries that are World Trade Organization members obtained a grace period

until 2013—and until 2016 specifically for pharmaceuticals—to recognize these property 
rights in their national policies. At the national level, the regime has two functions: (a) cat-
egorizing of intellectual knowledge as private property and (b) utilizing a State-enforced 
monopoly-of-use award as the main approach to recognizing private property and moti-
vating private innovation. Non-owners of property must pay for the privilege to use, adapt 
and undertake further innovations of the technology. Because most intellectual property is 
owned in the developed countries, intellectual property becomes a cost of development for 
post-TRIPS developing countries, to be budgeted among all the other spending required 
to overcome underdevelopment.

evidence that stronger 
property rights are a

innovation in countries

frontier

Patenting is very aggressive 
in various areas of  
green technology

World Trade Organization member States have retained important flexibilities 
and safeguards under the TRIPS Agreement. (United Nations, 2010b, p. 65). Countries 
can interpret the three criteria of patentability (novelty, inventive step and industrial appli-
cability) in line with strategic domestic objectives. Governments can also issue compulsory 
licences and undertake “parallel imports” for stated social objectives, provided adequate 
compensation is made. Developing countries “with the capacity to do so” can take advan-
tage of these flexibilities consistent with their development ambitions.

In practice, these flexibilities have been difficult to exploit (United Nations, 
2010c, pp. 82-83). For one thing, trade-oriented countries seek to maintain a “welcom-
ing reputation” towards foreign companies. Moreover, many countries are signatories to 
bilateral treaties which require stronger-than-TRIPs intellectual property protection.

The existence of an enforceable global intellectual property regime is part of 
the climate in which developing countries must attempt to pursue sustainable develop-
ment. Country case-studies reported in Odagiri and others (2010) suggest that, while the 
TRIPS has stymied national innovation, notably in the pharmaceutical industry, it has not 
been as constraining in other industries, particularly those requiring product assembly. 
Quite significantly, these case studies also suggest that it is difficult to find evidence that 
stronger property rights are a significant motivator of innovation in countries below the 
technological frontier. Overall, except for pharmaceuticals, the TRIPS does not appear to 
have a strong impact in its first 10 years because of specific characteristics of industries. 
Most of the cited case studies dealt with countries with successful industrial development 
policies, whose promotion of creative activities and determination enabled them to get 
around  intellectual  property-related  obstacles  when  their  attempts  to  purchase  a  given 
technology at a reasonable price failed.

Patenting is very aggressive in various areas of green technology. For example, 
a small group of private companies is actively patenting plant genes with a view to securing 
ownership of the rights to the genes’ possible future “climate readiness” (Shashikant, 2009, 
p. 23). There has been a rapid increase in international patenting activity specifically in 
climate change mitigation technologies, compared with other technologies (figure VI.1). 
The  intense  interest  in  green  technologies  and  the  growing  competition  among  major 
economies (which include some developing countries such as India and China) suggests 
that it would be foolhardy to presume that the relatively benign impact of the TRIPS on 
countries with strong industrial policies would be benign in the case of green technology.
As a contrast, the example of rapid international diffusion during the green 
revolution in agriculture of the 1960s and 1970s (see chap. III) has been an important 
precedent for publicly led, rather than private sector-dependent international technology 
transfer.  Under  the  auspices  of  the  CGIAR,  “miracle  seeds”  were  placed  in  the  public 
domain to assist in the pursuit of the global objective of raising food production so as to 
keep up with population growth.

Inadequate investment rates due to volatile  
global markets and fiscal constraints

In developing countries, enhanced domestic resource mobilization (private savings and 
public revenues) is key for the required additional investment effort for sustainable devel-
opment over the medium term. However, many developing countries have poorly devel-
oped markets for long-term financing and a weak fiscal basis, which limits the scope for 
substantial increases in domestic funding for long-term investment in the near term. An 
additional, and inadvertent, constraint on domestic investment in developing countries 
arises from deficiencies in the global financial and payments system. A number of develop-
ing countries hold a significant portion of domestic savings as international reserves, which 
have been largely invested in financial assets in developed countries to the tune of more 
than $500 billion per year3 (United Nations, 2011), which compares unfavourably with a 
required developing-country green investment of about $1.1 trillion per year, as indicated 
below. Volatile global capital and commodity markets are an important reason behind 
this costly form of self-protection and the substantial net transfer of financial resources to 
advanced market economies.

For  many  developing  countries,  the  combination  of  volatile  global  financial 
flows and open capital accounts unduly restrict domestic fiscal policy to a profile char-
acterized by a deflationary bias, small deficits and volatile public investment spending in 
response  to  external  shocks.  Particularly  for  countries  with  still  weak  export  capacities, 
such as commodity exporters, and limited access to international borrowing, fiscal policy

Between 2000 and 2010, the aggregate investment in developed countries’ assets was $5.5 trillion 
by developing countries and $0.8 trillion by economies in transition (United Nations, 2011).

has a limited ability to smooth consumption and sustain public investment rates so as to 
crowd in private risk-taking. Public authorities have been forced to postpone or terminate 
infrastructure and other long-term investment projects during downturns because of strict 
fiscal deficit targets, thereby jeopardizing their medium-term growth prospects.

Inadequate financing for technological  
development and transfer

Inadequate financing has been consistently identified by developing countries as the great-
est  obstacle  to  their  rapid  adoption  of  clean  technologies  (figure  VI.2).  At  every  stage 
of  technological  development,  there  are  public  sector  and  private  sector  obstacles  put 
in the way of their finding the needed financing (this is succinctly summarized in table 
VI.2). These obstacles can be economic—financing for green technologies competes with 
other public priorities and inadequate internal rates of return restrain private risk-taking 
(chap. V). They can also be political, such as hesitation on the part of Governments to 
intervene in markets in the face of resistance from vested interests or consumer preferences 
(chap.  II).  There  may  also  be  constraints  on  domestic  capabilities,  such  as  those  stem-
ming from insufficient investment in education (chap. V). Finally, there are international 
cooperation-related obstacles, such as those associated with conflicts between export credit 
agency conditions and local financial requirements.

Investment requirements for sustainable development

There is a proliferation of estimates of required investment levels needed to achieve sus-
tainable development. In chapter II, investment needs for the energy transformation were 
estimated at $1.6 trillion per year during 2010-2050. Chapter III presented the objec-
tive of achieving food security for an increasing world population. In this regard, Nelson 
and  others  (2009)  suggest  that  investment  requirements  for  achieving  the  objective  of

estimates

baseline investment and

needs

Timely progress in 
achieving mitigation 
will significantly reduce 
adaptation costs

maintaining  calorie  intake  to  counteract  the  potential  decline  in  yields  due  to  climate 
change is about $7 billion per year from the year 2000. Published estimates of developing- 
country financing requirements for adaptation vary from $50 billion to $100 billion per 
year (O’Connor, 2009). For developed countries, published estimates range from between 
$15 billion and $150 billion per year (Stern, 2007).

The variety of assumptions and methodologies used in different studies explains 
the wide range of published estimates of sustainable development investment requirements. 
Some differences stem from different target objectives (for example, 550 versus 450 ppmv 
CO2 atmospheric concentration). There are also divergences in coverage of investment in-
cluded (for example, whether or not to include the construction of additional transportation 
infrastructure in the estimates of costs of installing wind farms in remote areas or costs for 
the diffusion of improved, sustainable agricultural technology). More often than not, there 
is a tendency to underestimate investment requirements in infrastructure and shelter in 
developing countries and the costs from climate change of increased mortality and disease 
burden (O’Connor, 2009). The estimate of Nelson and others (2009) of the investment 
costs of ensuring food security, cited in the previous paragraph, does include additional 
infrastructure cost (roads and irrigation systems), based on region-specific cost estimates.

There is also the important distinction between total investment, which includes 
both a baseline projection of investment costs for (traditional and green) energy production 
under business-as-usual assumptions and the incremental costs of an acceleration of the 
energy transition, and an investment estimate solely reflecting additional (“incremental”) 
investment under what would have been a baseline scenario. The $1.6 billion per year invest-
ment requirement for energy transformation, set out in chapter II and, based on a specific 
scenario in the Global Energy Assessment (GEA) of 2009, includes both the investment 
needs under a business-as-usual scenario investment and the additional investment require-
ments for scaling up renewable energy technology and enhancing energy efficiency. The 
International Energy Agency (IEA) (2009) reports only a required incremental investment 
in 2020 of $427 billion globally (on top of investments required to match projected popula-
tion and income growth), with almost $200 billion in non-Organization for Economic 
Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries, to achieve stabilization at 450 ppmv 
CO2-equivalent by 2050 (the global investment cost is projected to rise to $1.2 trillion in 
2030, or 1.1 per cent of world gross product (WGP). This estimate would be in line with the 
total investment (incremental plus base) requirement of the specific GEA scenario of $1.6 
billion per year, the latter figure being about 2.5 per cent of WGP.

Finally, the fact that assumptions of the base scenario regarding other vari-
ables, such as population and economic growth (which also have interactions with each 
other and with investment itself), will affect the estimates, explains why every reported 
estimate is specific to a chosen scenario.

The  United  Nations  Environment  Programme  (2011)  makes  another  set  of 
scenario choices and proposes an investment requirement estimate of about 2 per cent 
of WGP from 2010 to 2050 (in level terms, this would amount to $1.3 trillion in 2010). 
This represents an estimate of incremental investment requirements relative to the baseline 
scenario as defined by UNEP.

All estimates are subject to a host of caveats and uncertainties. They rest on 
debatable  assumptions  about  cost  and  technology  learning  curves,  about  the  degree  of 
interaction between technological change across sectors and about the extent to which the 
continuum between climate change mitigation, adaptation and disaster risk prevention are 
taken into account. For example, accelerated progress in achieving mitigation will likely 
significantly reduce adaptation costs.

Building a global technology development and sharing regime

Table VI.3 presents an estimate of required investment levels across the vari-
ous sectors covered by this Survey, with an attempt to offer some consistency in scenarios 
across sectors. It makes the strong assumption that mitigation efforts will be undertaken 
in  a  timely  manner.  It  incorporates  estimates  for  meeting  universal  access  to  modern 
energy and adequate access to food by 2030. The values in table VI.3 are broadly in line 
with the UNEP 2011 estimates, but suggest the investment needs to induce the green 
energy transformation would be higher. It is important to note, however, that the figures 
are not strictly comparable, as the underlying model-based scenarios tend to differ across 
the studies.

Given these caveats, by the estimates reported in table VI.3, it would seem 
reasonable to put the overall incremental investment requirements for achieving sustain-
able development objectives at about 3 per cent of WGP.

Among  the  items  in  table  VI.3,  the  estimate  for  agricultural  investment  is 
solely for developing countries alone and it is assumed (based on available studies) that 
roughly 80 per cent of the adaptation investments would need to be undertaken in de-
veloping countries. Incremental investment requirements for climate change adaptation 
and  sustainable  agriculture  are  only  6-7  per  cent  of  the  green  investment  total,  based 
on the “central” estimates reported in table VI.3. In other words, most of the additional 
resources would be needed for investing in the green energy transformation. About two 
thirds of energy and energy end-use investments would need to take place in developing 
countries, and most of these would be in development of new energy systems, in contrast 
with developed countries, where they would be for replacing and transforming existing 
capital invested in energy systems.

Financial transfers for developing countries

Hence, much of the incremental investment in green technology will need to take place 
in developing countries. Even as the majority of the basic research and development is 
expected to occur in developed countries, developing countries will have a potentially big-
ger role in demonstration, deployment and diffusion, including the cost of building related 
infrastructure. In developing countries, the new technologies can be installed not just to 
replace existing “brown” activity but also to increase the scale of economic activity.

For climate change mitigation, the largest potential for increasing the supply of 
clean primary energy supply is in developing countries (chap. II; United Nations, 2009). 
Hence, the bulk of the incremental investment for the energy transformation would need 
to take place in developing countries, even though on a per-project basis costs are higher 
in developed countries. At least one half of the related estimated incremental investments 
for climate change mitigation and, as per the assumptions underlying the estimates in 
table VI.3, all incremental investments in sustainable agriculture for food security would 
need to take place in developing countries. Applying a rough proportion of 60 per cent4 of 
incremental investment for developing countries suggests at least $1.1 trillion incremental 
investment per year in developing countries.

4

A proportion of 60 per cent in favour of developing countries is in line with current proportions in 
the energy sector. Table VI.3 suggests that adaptation (based on the assumption that mitigation 
will be undertaken in a timely manner) and agriculture’s incremental investment requirements 
represent  no  more  than  6-7  per  cent  of  the  total,  even  though  100  per  cent  of  these  sectors’ 
reported estimates are required for developing countries. Sixty per cent can be seen as a lower 
bound for the proportion of global investment needed for developing countries.

The overall incremental 
investment requirements 
for achieving sustainable 
development objectives 
would be about 3 per cent 
of world gross product

About $1.1 trillion will 
be needed per year for 
incremental investments 
in green technology in 
developing countries

World Economic and Social Survey 2011

Since the Rio conference 
in 1992, there have been 
many efforts to enhance 
resource availability for 
investments in sustainable 
development

Aid to the environment 
has not kept pace with the 
average increase in  
aid programmes

Since the Earth Summit, there have been many efforts to secure the finance 
needed  for  sustainable  development.  Recently,  at  the  United  Nations  Climate  Change 
Conference held in Copenhagen in December 2009, developed countries pledged to provide 
$30 billion during 2010-2012 and $100 billion per year by 2020 towards the cost of fighting 
climate change in poorer countries. There is also a proposal, set out in a recent International 
Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  Staff  Position  Note,  exploring  the  use  of  special  drawing  rights 
(SDRs) to start a “Green Fund” with new financing flows of about $17 billion a year during 
the “start-up phase” (2011-2013), increasing quickly to $100 billion by 2020 (Bredenkamp 
and Pattillo, 2010). In November 2010, the Secretary-General’s Advisory Group on Energy 
and Climate Change (United Nations, 2010c) reported that the $100 billion transfer target 
is achievable through a combination of public and private financing mechanisms.

Official  development  assistance  (ODA)  from  Organization  for  Economic 
Cooperation and Development/Development Assistance Committee countries, as aid for 
the environment, increased steadily, by 5 per cent per annum, from 1998 to 2007 to reach 
almost  $18  billion  in  2009  (figure  VI.3).  Nevertheless,  aid  to  the  environment  has  not 
kept pace with the 8 per cent average increase in aid programmes, losing share to aid for 
health and population and government services. Nonetheless, the absolute level ($18 bil-
lion) could be considered as being in the range of the Copenhagen pledges of $30 billion 
for climate financing to developing countries during 2010-2012. If the flows committed to 
in Copenhagen are indeed realized as “additional” to, and not a recategorization of, exist-
ing commitments, these would seem like a doubling of transfers, but, because sustainable 
investment  requires  investments  in  many  other  sectors  such  as  energy,  fall  considerably 
short based on total estimated needs. Moreover, the Secretary-General’s high level advisory 
panel did not interpret the corresponding $100 billion pledge for 2020 as financed only 
from ODA but from a mix of many sources, including private investment.

At the multilateral level, there exists a diversity of specific funding streams. 
They are presented in table VI.4, showing a wide range of pledged funding for developing 
countries channelled through a plethora of financing mechanisms. A total of $18 billion 
has been pledged, $2 billion deposited and $734 million disbursed (O’Connor, 2009).

Restricted domestic policy space from international  
trade and investment regimes

Over the medium term, the restricted domestic policy space of developing countries in 
the area of industrial development, stemming from multilateral and bilateral trade com-
mitments and bilateral investment agreements, could be a barrier to rapid introduction 
of green technology in those countries. Technologies in general and green technologies

World Economic and Social Survey 2011

The multilateral trading 
system provides restricted 
space for industrial policies

The global governance 
system does not maintain 
effective mechanisms 
for coordination among 
specialized areas of 
governance

The objective of 
sustainable development 
is cross-cutting with 
respect to international 
efforts in development, 
environmental policy and 
technical cooperation

in particular are mostly imported from abroad. During the period when new domestic 
capabilities in new industries and products are being built, local producers would need to 
enjoy a period of protection from foreign competition. It is also critical that the relation-
ship with foreign companies provide benefits to the local economy in terms of technology 
transfer. To build green sectors, which bear many of the characteristics of infant industries 
(chap. V), domestic authorities require policy space for industrial policies.

The multilateral trading system, as currently constituted, provides restricted 
space  for  such  policies.  Bilateral  trade  treaties  normally  contain  even  more  restrictive 
provisions.  Because  industrial  policies  tend  to  promote  capabilities  of  residents  and 
domestic  corporations  and  thus  discriminate  against  foreign  nationals,  only  a  limited 
number  of  activities,  such  as  basic  research  and  regional  development,  are  permitted 
under World Trade Organization rules. Two recent complaints from the United States, 
regarding Canada’s feed-in-tariff scheme and China’s subsidies for clean energy technolo-
gies, could eventually be brought to the World Trade Organization’s dispute resolution 
mechanism. A potential result of these actions is a haphazard set of specific industrial 
policies  that  would  be  allowed  and  of  specific  ones  that  would  be  prohibited.  Trends 
in  the  Doha  trade  negotiations  suggest  that  the  industrial  policy  space  now  afforded 
to developing countries through higher bound tariffs for manufactured goods could be 
headed for further reduction.

Incoherence and weaknesses in international governance

Many developing-country Governments face challenges in restoring their capacity to de-
velop strong technology policies, as discussed in chapter V. Creating public capacities in 
managing and promoting technological development is doubly challenging in the interna-
tional arena, where there are no systems of coordination and governance comparable with 
those existing in national contexts. In the context of both practice and policy, establishing 
the requisite public sector role in the area of economic and development cooperation at 
the international level presents a distinct challenge. The recent global financial crises in 
food, energy and finance exposed serious shortcomings in institutions and rules which 
were created, for the most part, more than 60 years ago (United Nations, 2010c). The glo-
bal governance system does not maintain effective mechanisms for coordination among 
specialized areas of governance and does not prevent the adoption of conflicting decisions. 
Moreover, a set of important public international institutions—with authority over, for 
example, the coordination of financial regulation, debt resolution and the movement of 
natural persons—are missing.

The objective of sustainable development is a cross-cutting issue with respect 
to international efforts in development, environmental policy and technical cooperation. 
There are some evolving international mechanisms designed to address the challenges that 
arise in areas of intersection, notably within the United Nations Framework Convention 
on  Climate  Change.  For  example,  Convention  outcomes  have  consistently  emphasized 
the critical importance of technology diffusion under public sector leadership. This will 
require amending the global trade and financial regime which relies almost exclusively on 
private channels for the international diffusion of technology. Efforts in this regard will 
be tested as individual States and private companies seek to survive or gain dominance in 
green technology through actions in the arenas of aid, trade and finance.

Building a global technology development and sharing regime 

179

Reforming multilateral trading rules and 
international finance to accelerate green 
technology development and diffusion

Achieving the global technological revolution and overcoming the deficiencies of existing 
mechanisms  require  sustained  scaling  up  and  reform  in  international  cooperation  and 
finance. First, an international regime for technology sharing will have to be established to 
facilitate sustainable development in developing countries and will have to include utiliza-
tion of a broader set of tools in the domain of intellectual property and multilateral trade 
policies. Second, securing adequate development finance and policy space for energizing 
developing-country  efforts  to  upgrade  production  technologies  towards  environmental 
sustainability is indispensable. Third, international governance and cooperation have to 
be upgraded.

Establishing an effective global technology 
development and diffusion regime

The Montreal Protocol 
created a financing pool 
governed jointly by 
both contributing and 
beneficiary countries to pay 
for the costs of transition to 
new technology

Expanding action in nurturing and upgrading green production and consumption tech-
nologies in developing countries must be a key goal of international cooperation. As dis-
cussed, publicly guided international mechanisms of technological diffusion have limited 
precedents.  Historically  the  bulk  of  technological  knowledge  has  been  embodied  and 
transferred as private property through the operations of private companies.

Elements  from  the  successful  experience  of  the  CGIAR  in  promoting  the 
rapid worldwide diffusion of new agricultural technologies through a publicly supported 
global  and  regional  network  of  research  institutions  can  be  part  of  the  design  of  the 
global regime. The 1987 Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer5
is an example of a successful global framework within which sovereign States can move 
towards implementing a swift and radical shift away from polluting technologies world-
wide, with special support to developing countries in adopting new technologies. The 
support  included  the  creation  of  a  financing  pool  funded  by  developed  countries  but 
governed jointly by both contributing and beneficiary countries to pay for the costs of 
transition to new technology.

In  the  climate  change  area,  building  international  public  policymaking  ca-
pability can draw upon already existing international scientific networks and the multi-
stakeholder example provided by the work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change.  The  international  community  took  the  first  step  in  regard  to  this  challenge 
in  reaching  agreement  at  the  sixteenth  session  of  the  Conference  of  the  Parties  to  the 
United  Nations  Framework  Convention  on  Climate  Change  held  in  Cancun,  Mexico, 
in November/December 2010, on setting up a Technology Executive Committee (TEC) 
as a policymaking body to implement a framework for meaningful and effective actions 
designed to enhance the implementation of commitments on technology transfer. At the 
same  session,  agreement  was  reached  on  establishing  an  operational  body  to  facilitate 
networking among national, regional, sectoral and international technology bodies, to be 
called the Climate Technology Centre and Network (CTCN).

Orienting the intellectual property rights regime towards 
stimulating innovation of green technologies

Granting intellectual 
property rights should 
always remain a public 
policy action with the 
intention to stimulate—not 
restrict—private initiative

The intellectual property 
regime should not 
prevent non-owners of 
the technology from 
undertaking experiments 
and test applications 
that could improve such 
technology

Limitations on compulsory 
licensing do not fit well 
with the public purpose of 
climate change compliance

Managing global intellectual property rights is also crucial and a logical overriding prin-
ciple. Granting intellectual property rights should be a public policy action and should 
always remain so, consistent with the policy’s intention to stimulate—not restrict—pri-
vate initiative in technological development. The starting point of public policy would be 
treating “compliance with climate change policies as a public good” (Maskus and Okediji, 
2010, p. viii). At the present time, the granting of a patent is the most widespread and 
lucrative technological development incentive. What is required at the national level is a 
public policy that ensures a higher standard and more transparent and rigorous processes 
for  recognizing  international  intellectual  property.  Developing  countries  particularly 
should raise the standard for patent registration in their jurisdictions. Studies indicate 
that, particularly at lower levels of development, there is no evidence that greater protec-
tion of intellectual property rights has promoted domestic technological development or 
diffusion (Odagiri and others, 2010; Dosi, Marengo and Pasquali, 2007).

Obtaining agreement among countries on public policies needed to acceler-
ate invention and diffusion is critical. Currently, protecting private intellectual property 
rights  by  enforcing  exclusive  use  and  deployment  by  its  owner  is  the  main  approach. 
Internationally, a wider mix of public sector strategies will be required to spur green tech-
nological development. There is a need to guarantee a sufficient commercial incentive to 
private parties to undertake research using subsidies and public purchases of technology 
at reasonable cost, while constraining monopolistic practices which restrict both diffusion 
and  further  development.  This  means  that  the  intellectual  property  regime  should  not 
prevent non-owners of the technology from undertaking experiments and test applications 
that could improve the technology or that could help build new domestic capabilities. 
One  discordance  under  the  otherwise  successful  Montreal  Protocol  to  reduce  harmful 
substances was the fact that chemical manufacturers in India were unsuccessful in buy-
ing the technology for producing approved coolant chemicals at reasonable cost from the 
small group of manufacturers in developed countries that owned it.

Maskus  and  Okediji  (2010)  make  the  case  for  reforming  the  international 
intellectual property system on behalf of “environmentally sound technologies” (ESTs). 
Drawing on experiences in industrialized countries, they state that compulsory licences 
“are a valid tool to facilitate access to technology under well-defined conditions” (p. viii). 
Some of these conditions are set out in the limitations and exceptions provisions of the 
TRIPS Agreement, which need to be incorporated in domestic regulations of technology 
recipients. Limitations on compulsory licensing do not fit well with the public purpose of 
achieving climate change compliance. For example, under article 31 (f) of the Agreement, 
World Trade Organization members cannot use compulsory licences to produce for export 
markets. If these licences are mainly applied to enable countries to comply with emissions 
targets, production for export purposes is not of commercial interest to technology re-
cipients. On the other hand, Maskus and Okediji (2010, p. 34) point out that “ironically, 
given that climate change is a global public good, it would actually be beneficial to have 
production for export purposes, as ultimately this would increase the number of ESTs in 
circulation”.

A range of policy tools could be considered by the international community:
Placing basic technology or technology with multiple uses in the public domain

1. 

The  international  community  or  self-selected  groups  of  countries  (including  groupings 
among  developing  countries)  could  convene  expert  committees  to  determine  which 
technologies meet the criteria of basic technology. To place them in the public domain, 
countries  could  either  exercise  the  power  of  eminent  domain  in  respect  of  those  tech-
nologies  (through  a  concerted  application  of  individual-country  compulsory  licensing 
rights6 under the TRIPS, for example) or purchase them at a reasonable rate of compensa-
tion. Jurisprudence in the many industrialized countries, including the United States of 
America, is an abundant source of precedents and grounds for the application of compul-
sory licensing, not to mention federal powers reserved for converting private property to 
public use on grounds of eminent domain or under anti-trust laws (ibid., p. 31). Box VI.2 
summarizes some existing precedents in the United States legal system.
Awarding cash prizes for technical solutions to defined problems

2. 

The international community or self-selected groups of countries could form expert com-
mittees that would define problems requiring technological solutions and award prizes for 
solutions. Countries in the consortia would contribute to the pool for the awards.

Compulsory patent licensing in the United States of America

In  the  United  States  of  America,  compulsory  patent  licensing  provisions  have  been  addressed  in 
specific legislation. Some relevant examples include:

 y

 y

 y

,a which allows for such licensing when the patented innovation 
The Atomic Energy Act
is “(u)seful in the production or utilization of special nuclear material or atomic energy”. 
The Atomic Energy Commission can determine whether a compulsory patent licence 
should be granted and the reasonable royalty owed by the licensee. 
,b which permits compulsory patent licensing when a recipient of 
The Bayh-Dole Act
federal grants and contracts “has not taken, or is not expected to take within a reason-
able time, effective steps to achieve practical application of the subject invention”. The 
federal Government can also exercise its “march-in rights” by showing that a compulsory 
patent licence is necessary “to alleviate health or safety needs” or “to meet requirements 
for public use specified by Federal regulations”. 
c also provides for compulsory patent licences when the patented in-
The Clean Air Act
novation is necessary to comply with the emission requirements, where no reasonable 
alternative is available, and where non-use of the patented innovation would lead to a 
“lessening of competition or a tendency to create a monopoly”. A district court can, with 
the assistance of the Attorney General, determine whether a compulsory patent licence 
should be granted and can set the reasonable terms. 
There are many cases where developed-country Governments have granted or threat-
ened to grant compulsory licences to overcome the patent barrier for various purposes. Courts in 
many of these countries have also utilized compulsory licencing through opting for payment of royal-
ties by the infringing party to the patent-holder in lieu of granting an injunction to the patent-holder. 
Developing countries are also increasingly making use of the provision of compulsory licences, al-
though largely for purposes of either importing or producing affordable generic medicines.

Compulsory licences are allowed only for the purpose of serving the domestic markets. Patent-
holders are still protected in export markets.

Listing technologies in pools and permitting qualified parties (such as developing  
countries or firms in developing countries) to use the technology without  
compensation until its use has borne commercial fruit

The international 
community could come to 
a decision on which brown 
technologies would be 
banned from a certain date

It is important to guarantee 
sufficient policy space 
in developing countries 
for their own industrial 
development

Private and public property owners would be invited to contribute their technology to 
the pool. Users of the technology would begin paying reasonable royalties (at previously 
agreed rates) when they had achieved commercial returns from its use.

Establishing funding pools to facilitate technology transfer is a critical element 
in ensuring that individual technology development initiatives add up to global objectives. 
These kinds of pools do not exist at present. These can be applied to purchase technol-
ogy or to fund research and award prizes. The international community could come to 
a decision on which brown technologies would be banned from a certain date; countries 
requiring the alternative technology could draw on these funds to fulfil their obligations. 
With  these  funds,  it  should  be  possible  to  establish  international  innovation  networks 
in different areas of technology. The private sector must continue to play a vital role in 
technological development, particularly in adapting and developing basic inventions for 
actual application.

The  new  international  regime  should  allow  special  and  differential  access  to 
new technology by level of development. For example, developing-country Governments 
and firms could be allowed to adapt technology but would pay royalties only when its use 
begins to yield commercial returns. Where exclusive private sector rights of use to vital 
technology are a hindrance to developing other needed technology or to widespread use, 
the technology regime must have a mechanism for imposing a “compulsory licence” which 
places the technology in the public domain, as is done in areas of public health.

Multilateral trading rules should grant developing countries 
greater flexibility in conducting industrial policies

Present project-oriented loan conditionality and the proliferation of international financing 
mechanisms thwart developing countries’ efforts to design and implement coherent strate-
gies for sustainable development. From the multilateral trade regime and bilateral treaties 
which include restrictions on “investment measures”—such as prohibitions on imposing 
technology transfer or domestic content requirements—shackle attempts at implementing 
industrial policy at a time when developed-country industrial interventions for building 
green technologies are proliferating. Thus, it is important that developing countries be 
guaranteed sufficient policy space for their own industrial development.

Historically, rich countries’ agricultural subsidies under the multilateral trade 
regime have been a source of vexation. The requirements of accelerated technological dif-
fusion to promote sustainable agriculture (chap. III) and national adaptation to climate 
change (chap. IV) suggest that faster progress in eliminating the harmful effects of these 
subsidies on developing countries has to be part of a global environmental regime.

Consistent with the aim of promoting green technological development and 
transformation, the multilateral trade regime must begin to recognize the role of industrial 
policy in creating “green space”.

The multilateral trade regime would not be a hindrance to industrial policies 
affecting non-tradable sectors (such as infrastructure construction), including industrial 
policy for green objectives, as long as those policies were not affected by a country’s bi-
lateral  trade  or  investment  agreements.  Environmental  regulations  and  interventions 
affecting  public  education,  strengthening  integrated  planning,  improved  transparency, 

Building a global technology development and sharing regime 

183

accountability and law enforcement, reform of environmental laws, building codes and 
transportation  standards,  and  upgraded  measurement  and  indicators  for  monitoring 
(Cosbey, 2011a) would not run afoul of World Trade Organization disciplines.

For tradable sectors, a greater range and higher levels of bound tariffs are often 
key tools: fiscally constrained developing countries can utilize them to develop specific indus-
tries. Further, as regards the tradable sectors, the possible implications of recognizing the need 
for green policy space will require a revisiting of the restrictions contained in the World Trade 
Organization  Agreement  on  Trade-related  Investment  Measures  (TRIMs)  (World  Trade 
Organization, 1994) and the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (ibid.).

Establishing a multilateral regime that recognizes the role of national industrial 
policy and coordinates transfers of financial and technical resources towards developing 
countries  is  a  challenge  that  can  be  addressed  explicitly  by  international  agreement  or 
resolved de facto through trade disputes and rulings of the World Trade Organization 
dispute settlement mechanism (ibid., p. 56). The disadvantage of the latter approach is 
that it will create a possibly extended period of uncertainty with regard to public policy 
and private investment (Cosbey, 2011b). It would be preferable for the revisiting of these 
agreements to be undertaken under the auspices of the World Trade Organization, even 
as the non-completion of the Doha negotiations represents an impediment to opening 
negotiations on new issues.

Policies that promote domestic green industries at the expense of foreign com-

petitors and can be subject to dispute could take the following forms (ibid., p. 54):

•	

•	
•	

Research, development and deployment support to domestic green sectors
Conditional  support  for  green  sectors,  designed  to  foster  green  infant 
industries
Regulations, standards and prohibitions based on production and processing 
methods (PPM)
The first policy type, which encompasses the early stages of innovation, while 
relatively uncontroversial, does put developing countries with more limited fiscal resources at 
a disadvantage. In the case of policy type two, World Trade Organization agreements restrict 
subsidies to domestic industries conditional on export performance or domestic content.

The principle providing the logical basis for PPM policies (type three) affirms 
that the way in which a product is made determines its environmental impact. The question 
is whether countries can protect their domestic industries by imposing border adjustment 
tariffs based on the way in which potential imports are produced. PPM-based policies 
are constrained by General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)-related rules and 
the World Trade Organization Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (World Trade 
Organization, 1994). GATT-World Trade Organization rules provide exceptions to these 
constraints in two environmentally related areas. Clause (b) of GATT article XX provides 
exceptions for measures “necessary to protect human, animal or plant life or health” and 
clause (g) excepts measures “relating to the conservation of exhaustible natural resources if 
such measures are made effective in conjunction with restrictions on domestic production 
or consumption”. Khor (2010, p. 8) argues that these exceptions apply only within the con-
text of the preamble of the article which prohibits measures “applied in a manner which 
would constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination between countries 
where the same conditions prevail, or a disguised restriction on international trade”.

Environmental standards have been effective industrial policy instruments for 
accelerating technological transformations. At present, technical standards are often de-
termined by Governments (unilaterally or through agreements among a reduced number 
of countries) or set by private companies. Wider participation of all parties in the setting

of these standards, especially developing countries, should guarantee that environmental 
standards  (including  through  green  labels  and  ecological  footprint  certificates)  do  not 
become a means of promoting unfair trade protectionism. The Montreal Protocol process, 
which identified the substances that would be banned and the pace of their elimination, 
may again serve as an example: the Montreal Protocol provided financial support for ad-
justment  to  the  agreed  standards.  A  similar,  but  much  more  ambitious  mechanism  to 
compensate countries economically disadvantaged by the standard-setting of other coun-
tries could be devised as part of global financing mechanisms for sustainable development. 
In  addition,  a  global  technology  policy  mechanism,  such  as  the  Technology  Executive 
Committee established in Cancun in November/December 2010, could serve as an ap-
pellate body where parties adversely affected by such standard-setting could seek a ruling 
from an expert panel on whether the standards were supported by scientific and practical 
consideration, as opposed to being protectionist actions.

World Trade Organization disciplines constrain green industry development 
in both developing and developed countries. If the objective is the acceleration of green 
technological  development,  rethinking  and  renegotiating  World  Trade  Organization 
disciplines will require attention to two facets: (a) what type of indicators of green devel-
opment—novelty, level of riskiness, high initial cost—should be agreed upon as providing 
a  reasonable  basis  for  discriminating  temporarily  in  favour  of  domestic  industries  and 
(b) how to embody the “common but differentiated responsibilities” principle in the ap-
plication of trade disciplines promoting sustainable development.

Financing of green technology transfers necessitates 
domestic and international financial reforms

The availability of public 
resources is important in 
financing start-ups in  
green sectors

To achieve the timely diffusion of the new green technologies, investment rates in most 
developing countries will have to be raised by about $1 trillion per year for the period from 
2010 to 2050. For developing countries, particularly, there is a need to eliminate interna-
tionally imposed restraints on long-term financing of domestic investment in pursuit of 
sustainable development.

Ensuring that domestic resources mobilized for investment are channelled to 
green investment and industries is the first and most important step. The availability of 
public resources is important in financing start-ups in green sectors. Overcoming domes-
tic resource constraints through broadening the revenue base and creating the capacity 
to  raise  long-term  finance  by  building  domestic  bond  markets  will  be  needed  to  raise 
public resources. Effective capital-account management and prudential regulations would 
go hand in hand with strengthened international tax cooperation with other countries. 
National Governments should also facilitate the rise of robust domestic financial sectors 
through effective supervision and regulation. All of these steps will permit Governments 
to acquire tools for counter-cyclical policy critical to sustaining private savings and invest-
ment activities.

Higher  investment  rates  and  the  need  to  import  technology  and  equipment 
will induce higher external deficits. Low-income countries would require increased external 
assistance to finance these deficits. More advanced developing countries that are able to ac-
cess international private markets and FDI can finance the bulk of their external deficits in 
this way. Reforms in sovereign debt mechanisms and rules to establish orderly markets will 
increase the flow of long-term development financing available to developing countries.

Building a global technology development and sharing regime 

185

A reversal of the current situation of net financial transfers from developing 
countries to developed countries is required. Inadequate regulation of volatile international 
private asset flows and deficiencies in reserve payments and exchange-rate mechanisms 
have motivated developing countries to accumulate developed countries’ liquid financial 
assets, leading to perverse transfers (United Nations, 2010c). Reforming the international 
financial system is a precondition for financing sustainable development because, once 
achieved, this will allow developing countries as a group to redirect their savings towards 
their own development financing needs. Enhanced global and regional reserve pooling 
arrangements will reduce the need for self-protection through individual-country reserves 
accumulation  (United  Nations,  2010c)  and  could  free  substantial  resources  (including 
from sovereign wealth funds) for long-term financing in green investments. Moreover, it 
would facilitate effective net resource transfers to developing countries.

Ensuring that developing countries have sufficient policy space within which 
to generate long-term financing from domestic sources (Ocampo, 2011b, p. 30), through 
cooperative  efforts  at  capital  regulation,  for  example,  will  reduce  the  volume  of  exter-
nal financing needed and the vulnerability to external debt crises. This will need to be 
matched by a “development-oriented” macroeconomic policy approach, which requires ef-
fective capital-account controls and counter-cyclical fiscal and monetary policies (United 
Nations, 2010c), as part of the toolkit for sustainable development.

Foreign investment and private flows

Based  on  recent  experience,  FDI  flows  can  play  an  important  role  in  diffusing  green 
technology in developing countries, as long as recipient countries adopt a strategic stance 
with regard to foreign investors by actively including technology acquisition in investor 
programmes. The precedents come from the rise of internationally competitive firms in 
China, such as Goldwind, through joint ventures and technology-sharing (United Nations, 
Department of Economic and Social Affairs, 2008; and chap. V). Within the framework 
of national innovation systems, developing countries can incorporate technology transfer 
provisions in foreign investment approvals. At the international level, this will require re-
laxing the provisions of the Agreement on Trade-related Investment Measures that restrict 
technology transfer requirements.

Upgrading levels and capabilities of global governance

The proposed reshaping of national development efforts and strengthened international 
cooperation  in  technological  development  and  cooperation,  external  assistance,  invest-
ment finance and trade rules will require stronger mechanisms of global governance and 
coordination. Within the next three to four decades, all of these efforts must “add up” to 
the achievement of what appear today to be almost unattainable targets, such as an almost 
three-fourths  reduction  in  per  capita  carbon  emissions  and  the  eradication  of  poverty, 
which will involve an almost 10-fold increase in the availability of modern energy to those 
now counted as poor.

The  bulk  of  the  efforts  directed  towards  technological  transformation  must 
occur at the country level and be built upon local conditions and resources (chap. V). The 
need for an effective global technology policymaking body has already been mentioned. 
There are several conditions for success. First, more effective monitoring and verification of 
performance on international commitments are needed. When establishing mechanisms

of mutual accountability, lessons can be drawn from existing models in other areas, such 
as the trade policy review process of the World Trade Organization.

Second, much greater coherence among the elements of the now rather dis-
jointed multilateral architectures for the environment, technology transfer, trade, aid and 
finance will be required in coordinating the likely diverse set of country strategies for green 
growth and ensuring that they add up to global targets for environmental sustainability. 
For example, the expansion of international financial services facilitated under the World 
Trade Organization General Agreement on Trade in Services (World Trade Organization, 
1994) unduly restricts the capacity of individual countries to regulate domestic financial 
markets. Establishing a better definition of the scope of the responsibilities of the disparate 
mechanisms involved and ensuring the coordination of their activities by existing bodies 
(such as the Economic and Social Council, which has an official coordination mandate) 
will require agreement among dominant economic countries (United Nations, 2010c).

There is a need to build 
mutual confidence in 
international public 
technology policymaking

International mechanisms 
should be able to monitor 
the performance of donors 
and recipients on their 
commitments

Third,  there  is  a  need  to  build  capacity  and  (given  the  limited  precedents) 
mutual  confidence  in  international  public  policymaking  on  technology.  A  particularly 
important  technical  issue  involves  deciding  which  technologies  are  most  appropriately 
placed in the public domain, either through purchase at reasonable cost from private own-
ers or through compulsory licencing. As emphasized in chapter II, particularly in the case 
of energy technologies, there is a need to build mechanisms providing effective technical 
input to international technology policymaking bodies with sufficient independence from 
political and commercial interests. As already noted, the tradition of the Intergovernmental 
Panel on Climate Change, which facilitated technical input conditioned by political ac-
countability, can provide a foundation on which to build at the international level.

Fourth,  the  governance  of  international  financing  mechanisms  will  have  to 
be upgraded to strengthen coordination and reinforce accountability. At present, there 
seem to be too many funds and programmes which have mobilized insufficient resources 
(United Nations, 2009) and are overly project-oriented and subjected to donor policy con-
ditionality (rather than aligned with national sustainable development strategies). Funding 
mechanisms  can  incorporate  governance  principles  like  those  of  the  Paris  Declaration 
regarding donor alignment to national priorities. It is also important that international 
mechanisms be established that can decide on guiding principles and standards for finan-
cial transfers and monitor performance of donors and recipients on their commitments 
at the aggregate level. Building on the successful Montreal Protocol approach has been 
proposed in the climate change framework negotiations conducted by the Group of 77 
and China. This will involve the creation of a board that would report to the Conference 
of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The 
board would ensure equitable representation with geographical balance. Donor flows that 
were not subject to the policies of the board would not count towards fulfilment of those 
donors’ commitments under the Convention.

Having agreed in 1992 that sustainable development is a goal to be shared 
among  developed  and  developing  countries,  the  global  community  will  need  to  make 
rapid progress in strengthening global, and particularly economic, governance. It would 
be advantageous for international bodies and mechanisms to identify universally agreed 
targets and specific global ones which could be utilized to help monitor progress and en-
sure accountability for the actions undertaken. Indeed, improved governance could make 
diverse actions undertaken in a variety of sectors and countries add up to what is required 
at the global level.
