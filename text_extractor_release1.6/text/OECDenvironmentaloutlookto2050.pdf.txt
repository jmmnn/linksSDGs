FOREWORD

Foreword

With a population of 7 billion, the world in 2012 faces highly complex economic and social

challenges. While protecting the environment and conserving natural resources remain key policy
priorities, many countries are also struggling with slow economic growth, stretched public finances
and high levels of unemployment. Tackling these pressing challenges requires a deep cultural shift
towards  "greener"  and  more  innovative  sources of  growth, and  more  sustainable  consumption
patterns.

The OECD Environmental Outlook to 2050 addresses the implications of demographic and
economic trends over the next four decades using model based projections for four key areas of global
concern: climate change, biodiversity, water and the health impacts of environmental pollution. The
reality is that, if we fail to transform our policies and behaviour, the picture is rather grim.

The “Baseline” scenario projects that, unless the global energy mix changes, fossil fuels will
supply about 85% of energy demand in 2050, implying a 50% increase in greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions and worsening urban air pollution. The impact on the quality of life of our citizens would
be disastrous. The number of premature deaths from exposure to particulate pollutants could double
from current levels to 3.6 million every year. Global water demand is projected to increase by 55% to
2050. Competition for water would intensify, resulting in up to 2.3 billion more people living in
severely water-stressed river basins. By 2050, global terrestrial biodiversity is projected to decline by
a further 10%.

The costs and consequences of inaction are colossal, both in economic and human terms. These
projections  highlight the urgent need  for  new  thinking. Failing  that, the  erosion of  our  natural
environmental  capital  will  increase  the  risk  of  irreversible  changes  that  could  jeopardise  two
centuries of rising living standards. We are already witnessing the catastrophic collapse of some
fisheries  from  overfishing,  and  severe  water  shortages  damaging  agriculture.  However,  these
enormous environmental challenges cannot be addressed in isolation. They must be managed in the
context of other global challenges, such as food and energy security, and poverty alleviation.

There are important dividends from integrating environmental objectives into economic and
sectoral policies, such as energy, agriculture and transport. Well designed policies to tackle one
environmental problem could also help alleviate others, and contribute to growth and development.
Tackling local air pollution, for example, can cut GHG emissions while reducing the economic burden
of chronic and costly health problems. Climate policies also help protect biodiversity, namely by
reducing emissions from deforestation.

This Outlook draws on a policy framework established by the OECD’s Green Growth Strategy,
which countries can tailor to their level of development, their particular resource endowments and
environmental pressures. But there are also several common approaches, like making pollution more
costly than greener alternatives (with environmental taxes and emissions trading schemes); valuing
and  pricing  the  natural  assets  and  ecosystem  services  (through  water  pricing,  payments  for
ecosystem services, natural park entrance charges); removing environmentally harmful subsidies (to

fossil fuels, electricity for pumping water for irrigation); and  encouraging green innovation (by
making polluting production and consumption modes more expensive, public support for basic R&D).

To make reform happen, governments will have to study the cost effectiveness of their policies
in great depth. Public acceptance will depend on hard evidence that policies will successfully tackle
environmental challenges, that they are affordable, and that they can deliver jobs and enable poverty
alleviation.

Taken together, the OECD Environmental Outlook to 2050 and the Green Growth Strategy
provide a comprehensive and practical way forward. Promoting efficient green policies will be a
major contribution from the OECD to the Rio + 20 Conference, in our mission of achieving better
policies for better lives.

The OECD Environmental Outlook to 2050 was prepared by a joint team from the OECD

Environment Directorate  and  the  PBL Netherlands  Environmental  Assessment  Agency
(PBL).  The  project  was  managed  by  Kumi  Kitamori  and  Ton  Manders  (PBL),  under  the
supervision of Simon Upton (Director), Helen Mountford (Deputy Director) and Rob Visser
(former Deputy Director).

The OECD Environment Policy Committee (EPOC) was responsible for the oversight of the
development of the report. In addition, the following OECD bodies reviewed and provided
comments on relevant chapters of this Outlook: Working Party on Climate, Investment and
Development (WPCID); Working Party on Biodiversity, Water and Ecosystems (WPBWE);
Working Party on Integrating Environmental and Economic Policies (WPIEEP); Working Party on
Environmental Information (WPEI); Joint Meeting of the Chemicals Committee and the
Working Party on Chemicals, Pesticides and Biotechnology; Joint Working Party on Agriculture
and Environment (JWPAE); and Committee on Fisheries (COFI).

Representatives from non-OECD countries – in particular Brazil, China, Colombia, India,
Indonesia and South Africa – provided comments and input through an Expert Meeting on the
Preparation of the Next Environmental Outlook (November 2010), and a Global Forum on
Environment  for  the  Review  of the Draft Environmental Outlook  Report  (October 2011).
Stakeholder representatives provided input to draft chapters, in particular environmental
NGOs (co-ordinated through the European Environmental Bureau), business (co-ordinated
through the Business and Industry Advisory Committee to the OECD), and trade unions
(co-ordinated through the Trade Union Advisory Committee to the OECD).

The drafters of the OECD Environmental Outlook to 2050 were:

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

The  socio-economic  modelling  for  the  OECD  Environmental  Outlook  to 2050  was
undertaken by the OECD team working on the ENV-Linkages model, and the environmental
modelling was undertaken by PBL using its IMAGE suite of models. Modelling work on
climate change was done with both ENV-Linkages and IMAGE. PBL used IMAGE and related
environmental models, including through collaboration with LEI at Wageningen University
and Research Centre on agriculture-economy modelling and the UNEP World Conservation
Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC).

The modelling teams were:

Executive Summary

1. Introduction

Over the past decades, human endeavour has unleashed unprecedented economic
growth  in  the  pursuit  of  higher  living  standards.  While  the  world’s  population  has
increased by over 3 billion people since 1970, the size of the world economy has more than
tripled.  While  this  growth  has  pulled  millions  out  of  poverty,  it  has  been  unevenly
distributed and incurred significant cost to the environment. Natural assets have been and
continue to be depleted, with the services they deliver already compromised by environmental
pollution.  Providing  for  a  further  2 billion  people  by 2050  and  improving  the  living
standards for all will challenge our ability to manage and restore those natural assets on which
all life depends. Failure to do so will have serious consequences, especially for the poor, and
ultimately undermine the growth and human development of future generations.

OECD countries have addressed a number of environmental challenges by putting in
place policies to protect human health and ecosystems from pollution, use resources more
efficiently, and prevent further environmental degradation. However, the sheer scale of
economic  and  population  growth  has  overwhelmed  the  pace  of  progress  in  curbing
environmental pressures. Progress on  an incremental,  piecemeal,  business-as-usual
basis in the coming decades will not be enough.

The OECD Environmental Outlook to 2050 asks “What could the next four decades bring?”
Based on joint modelling by the OECD and the PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment
Agency, it looks forward to the year 2050 to ascertain what demographic and economic
trends might mean for the environment if humanity does not introduce more ambitious
policies to manage natural assets with greater care. It then examines some of the policies
that could change that picture for the better. Can the planet’s resource base support ever-
increasing demands for energy, food, water and other natural resources, and at the same
time absorb our waste streams? Or will the growth process undermine itself? How can we
balance  environmental,  economic  and  social  objectives?  How  can  we  care  for  the
environment and improve livelihoods and living conditions for the poor? 

This Outlook focuses on four areas: climate change, biodiversity, water and the health
impacts of pollution.  These  four  key  environmental  challenges  were  identified  by  the
previous Environmental  Outlook  to 2030 as “Red light”  issues  requiring  urgent  attention
(see Chapter 1). It concludes that the prospects are more alarming than the situation
described in the previous edition, and that urgent – and holistic – action is needed now
to avoid the significant costs and consequences of inaction. Policy makers must take
decisions despite uncertainties. The Outlook presents achievable solutions, highlighting the
linkages between different environmental issues and some of the challenges and trade-
offs in the face of competing demands.

19

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

 Without new policies, progress 
in reducing environmental 
pressures will continue to be 
overwhelmed by the sheer 
scale of growth.

2. What could the environment look like in 2050?
By 2050,  the  Earth’s  population  is  expected  to
increase  from  7 billion  to  over  9 billion  people.
Coupled with expected higher living standards across
the world, global GDP is projected to almost quadruple
despite  the  recent  recession  (see Chapter 2).  In  the
coming  decades,  average  GDP  growth  rates  are
projected to slow gradually in China and India. While
Africa will remain the poorest continent, it is projected to see the world’s highest economic
growth rate between 2030 and 2050. The populations of OECD countries are expected to
live  longer,  with  over  a  quarter  of  their  people  projected  to  be  over  65 years  of  age
compared to about 15% today. China and India are also likely to see significant population
ageing,  with  China’s  workforce  actually  shrinking  by 2050.  In  contrast,  more  youthful
populations in other parts of the world, especially Africa, are expected to grow rapidly.
These  demographic  shifts  and  higher  living  standards  imply  evolving  lifestyles,
consumption  patterns  and  dietary  preferences,  all  of  which  will  have  significant
consequences for the environment and the resources and services it provides. Cities are
likely to absorb the total world population growth between 2010 and 2050. By 2050, nearly
70% of the world population is projected to be living in urban areas. This will magnify
challenges such as air pollution, transport congestion, and the management of waste and
water in slums, with serious consequences for human health.

Without new policy action, a world economy four times larger than today is projected
to use about 80% more energy in 2050 (see Chapter 2). Furthermore, the energy mix at the
global level is not projected to differ significantly from that of today. The share of fossil
energy would remain at about 85%, while renewables including biofuels would make up
just above 10%, with the balance being nuclear. The emerging economies of Brazil, Russia,
India, Indonesia, China and South Africa (referred to here as the “BRIICS”) are projected to
become major energy users, increasing their reliance on fossil fuels. To feed a growing
population with changing dietary preferences, agricultural land is projected to expand
globally in the next decade to match the increase in food demand, but at a diminishing
rate. This leads to a substantial increase in competition for scarce land. Globally, the area
of agricultural land is expected to peak before 2030 and decline thereafter as population
growth  slows  down  and  yield  improvements  continue  in  the  OECD  and  the  BRIICS.
However, in the rest of the world (RoW), a further expansion of agricultural land area is
projected. Deforestation rates are already declining – a trend that is projected to continue.
In China, for example, reduced agricultural land is projected to lead to an increase in forest
area, not least to meet growing global demands for wood and other forest products. 

The combination of no new policies and continuing socio-economic trends constitutes
this study’s “Baseline” scenario (see Chapters 1 and 2). Under the Baseline, pressures on the
environment from population growth and rising living standards will outpace progress in
pollution  abatement  and resource  efficiency.  As a result,  continued  degradation  and
erosion of natural environmental capital are expected to 2050 and beyond, with the risk
of irreversible changes that could endanger two centuries of rising living standards. The
Outlook  Baseline  scenario  suggests  that  the  costs  and  consequences  of  inaction  are
significant, both in economic and human terms.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The key environmental challenges identified in this Outlook for the coming decades
are  summarised  using  the  “traffic  light”  system  (Table 0.1).  Despite  some  pockets  of
improvements,  the  overall  outlook  for  the  four  themes  is  more  alarming  than  in  the
previous edition of the Outlook. For example, the Outlook does not identify any “Green light”
aspects for climate change. 

Without more ambitious policies, by 2050:

● More disruptive climate change is likely to be locked in, with global greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions projected to increase by more than 50%, primarily due to a 70% growth in CO2
emissions from energy use (Figure 0.1). While the recent economic crisis did slow emission
growth somewhat, the economic recovery has already reversed this temporary trend, and at
current rates, the atmospheric concentration of GHGs could reach almost 685 parts per
million (ppm) by 2050 (see Chapter 3). As a result, the global average temperature increase is
projected to be 3 oC to 6 oC higher by the end of the century, exceeding the internationally
agreed goal of limiting it to 2 oC above pre-industrial levels.
There is a notable gap between the 2 oC goal and the GHG emission reduction pledges by
developed and developing countries in the Cancún Agreements. Even if the pledges are fully
implemented, they will still not be enough to prevent the global average temperature from
exceeding the 2 oC threshold unless very rapid and costly emission reductions are realised
after 2020. A temperature increase of more than 2 oC would alter precipitation patterns;
increase glacier and permafrost melt; drive sea-level rise; worsen the intensity and
frequency of extreme weather events such as heat waves, floods and hurricanes; and
become the greatest driver of biodiversity loss. Both the pace of change and the other
environmental pressures identified in this report will hamper people’s and ecosystem’s
abilities to adapt. The cost of inaction on climate change could equate to a permanent loss
of over 14% in average world consumption per capita.

● Biodiversity loss is projected to continue, especially in Asia, Europe and Southern Africa.
Globally, terrestrial biodiversity (measured as mean species abundance – or MSA – an
indicator of the intactness of a natural ecosystem) is projected to decrease a further 10%
by 2050 (see Chapter 4). Primary forests, which are rich in biodiversity, are projected to
shrink in area by 13%, despite the increase in total forested area during this period. The main
pressures driving biodiversity loss include land-use change and management (agriculture),
the expansion of commercial forestry, infrastructure development, human encroachment
and fragmentation of natural habitats, as well as pollution and climate change (Figure 0.2).
Climate change is projected to become the fastest growing driver of biodiversity loss to 2050,
followed by commercial forestry and bioenergy croplands. 

About one-third of global freshwater biodiversity has already been lost, and further loss
is projected to 2050, especially in Africa, Latin America and parts of Asia. Continued
disturbances  to  ecosystems  could  pass  a  tipping  point  beyond  which  damage  is
irreversible. The  current  trend  of  declining  biodiversity  presents  a  threat  to  human
welfare, and will be very costly. The aggregate loss of biodiversity and ecosystem service
benefits  associated  with  the  global  loss  of  forests,  for  example,  is  estimated  to  be
between USD 2 and 5 trillion per year. Biodiversity loss will have severe implications for
the  rural  poor  and  indigenous  communities,  whose  livelihoods  are  often  directly
dependent on biodiversity and ecosystems, and the services these provide.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

● Freshwater availability will be further strained in many regions, with 2.3 billion more
people than today projected to be living in river basins experiencing severe water stress.
This means in total over 40% of the world’s population in water-stressed areas, especially
in North and South Africa, and South and Central Asia (see Chapter 5). Overall water
demand  is  projected  to  increase  by  some  55%,  due  to  growing  demand  from
manufacturing (+400%), thermal electricity generation (+140%) and domestic use (+130%)
(Figure 0.3).  In  the  face  of  these  competing  demands,  there  will  be  little  scope  for
increasing water for irrigation under the Baseline. The Baseline shows some reduction in
water  for  irrigation.  This  reflects  no  increase  in  irrigated  land  and  significant
improvements in efficiency. If these do not eventuate, competition for water will be even
more acute. The combined effects of these pressures could imply water shortages that
would hinder the growth of many economic activities. Environmental  flows will be
contested, putting ecosystems at risks, and groundwater depletion may become the greatest
threat to agriculture and urban water supplies in several regions in the coming decades. 

Nutrient pollution from point sources (urban wastewater) and “diffuse sources” (mainly
from agriculture) is projected to worsen in most regions, intensifying eutrophication and
damaging aquatic biodiversity. Notwithstanding this, the number of people with access
to an improved water source is expected to increase, essentially in the BRIICS. However,
globally more than 240 million people (mostly rural residents) are expected to be without
such  access  by 2050.  Sub-Saharan  Africa  is  unlikely  to  meet  the  Millennium
Development Goal (MDG) of halving by 2015 the 1990 level of the population without
access to an improved water source. Globally, more city dwellers did not have access to
an improved water source in 2008 than in 1990, as urbanisation outpaced connections to
water infrastructure. And access to an improved water source does not necessarily mean
access  to  safe  water  fit  for  human  consumption.  It  is  expected  that  the  MDG  for
sanitation will not be met by 2015, and by 2050 1.4 billion people are projected to be still
without access to basic sanitation, mostly in developing countries.

● The health impacts of urban air pollution continue to worsen under this scenario, with
air pollution set to become the top environmental cause of premature mortality globally
(Figure 0.4). Meanwhile, premature deaths caused by indoor air pollution from the use of
dirty fuels are projected to diminish, as well as child mortality from a lack of clean water
and poor sanitation, with the latter decrease due primarily to an overall increase in the
basic standard of living and the ageing of the population (i.e. fewer children who are the
most  susceptible).  Air  pollution  concentrations  in  some  cities,  particularly  in  Asia,
already far exceed World Health Organization safe levels, with deadly consequences:
only very large reductions will have any positive health effects (see Chapter 6). With
growing transport and industrial air emissions, the global number of premature deaths
linked to airborne particulate matter is projected to more than double to 3.6 million a
year, with most deaths occurring in China and India. Because of their ageing and highly
urbanised populations, OECD countries are likely to have one of the highest premature
death rates linked to ground-level ozone, second only to India, and worse than all other
countries.

● The  burden  of  disease  related  to  exposure  to  hazardous  chemicals  is  significant
worldwide and falls more heavily in non-OECD countries where good chemical safety
measures  have  not yet  been  put in  place.  Yet,  non-OECD  countries  are projected  to
account for an increasing share of the world chemicals production, with the BRIICS alone
accounting for a greater share of global sales than the OECD by 2050 under the Baseline.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

While governments in OECD countries are making progress collecting and assessing
information on human exposure to chemicals throughout their lifecycle, knowledge of
the health impacts of chemicals in products and in the environment – and in particular
effects from combined exposure to mixtures of chemicals – is still limited.

Delay in tackling these 
environmental challenges 
risks potentially irreversible – 
and in some cases very costly 
or even catastrophic – changes 
in the future.

The Environmental Outlook Baseline projections highlight
the urgent need for action today to change the course
of our future development. Delay in alleviating these
environmental pressures will impose significant costs,
undermine growth and development and run the risk
of  irreversible  and  potentially  catastrophic  changes
further into the future. Change in natural systems is
not linear. There is compelling scientific evidence that
natural systems have “tipping points” or biophysical boundaries beyond which rapid
and  damaging  change  becomes  irreversible  (e.g.  for  species  loss,  climate  change,
groundwater  depletion,  land  and  soil  degradation).  However,  these  tipping  points  or
thresholds are in many cases not yet fully understood, nor are the environmental, social and
economic consequences of crossing them. 

What if…

The scientific community is expanding
the knowledge base needed for evidence-
based policy making, but in the meantime
policy makers must weigh up the costs of
action and inaction in the face of significant
uncertainty. Nevertheless, the costs and
consequences of ignoring environmental
challenges are significant, even if we lack
precise  values.  It  is  sensible  to  take
precautions,  as  continuing  to  deplete
natural assets and endangering the services
they  provide  can  have  far-reaching
economic  and  social  consequences,
especially in developing countries and for
the rural poor. A key policy challenge is to
strike a balance between giving clear policy signals to resource users and consumers, while
leaving room for manoeuvre and adaptation given the uncertainties that surround the
resilience of ecosystems and socio-economic consequences of destabilising them.

… NOx, SO2 and black carbon emissions
were  cut  by  up to  25%  by 2050?  This  Air
Pollution Reduction scenario would result in
an  added  benefit  of  a  5%  reduction  in
global CO2 emissions, but would not make
much  difference  in  preventing  the
expected  doubling  of  premature  deaths.
Given  that  the  pollution  levels  in  many
Asian cities in the Baseline scenario are far
above  safe  levels,  pollution  abatement
goals  would  have  to  be  even  more
ambitious to yield positive health impacts.

The Outlook highlights the linkages between the different environmental issues. For
example,  climate  change  can  affect  hydrological  cycles,  and  exacerbate  pressures  on
biodiversity and human health. Biodiversity and ecosystem services are intimately linked
to water, climate and human health: marshlands purify water, mangroves protect against
coastal flooding, forests contribute to climate regulation and genetic diversity provides for
pharmaceutical  discoveries.  These  cross-cutting  environmental  functions  must  be
carefully considered as they have wider economic and social implications, and point to the
need to improve resource efficiency and land use.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Acting now is not only environmentally rational, it is also economically rational. For
example, the Outlook suggests that if countries act now, there is still a chance – although a
receding  one –  of  global  GHG  emissions  peaking  before 2020  and  limiting  the  world’s
average temperature increase to 2 oC (see box below). To do so would make the costs of
adaptation and mitigation much more affordable. But unless more ambitious decisions are
taken soon, the window of opportunity will close. Investment decisions that are being
made today will lock in infrastructure for years or decades to come. The environmental
consequences of emissions-intensive investments today will be long-lasting. Meanwhile,
other  environmental  investments  can  offer  positive  returns.  The  Outlook  suggests, for
example, that investing in further air pollution reductions in BRIICS countries could yield
benefits outweighing the costs by as much as  10 to 1 (see Chapter 6). Investing in safe
water and sanitation in developing countries can yield benefit-to-cost ratios as high as
7 to 1 (Chapter 5).

What if…

…  we  start  today  to  limit  GHG
concentrations  to  450  ppm  using
carbon  pricing  to  meet  the  2 oC
g o a l ?   T h e  4 5 0   C o re    s c e n a r i o
suggests the cost would be to slow
economic growth by 0.2 percentage
points per year on average, costing
roughly 5.5% of global GDP in 2050.
This  pales  alongside  the  potential
cost of inaction  which could be  as
high  as  14%  of  averag e  world
consumption  per  capita  according
to  some  estimates.  The Outlook’s
estimate  of  cost  of  climate  action
may be overestimated, as it does not
reflect  the  benefits  of  climate
mitigation.

3. What policies can change this outlook?

Well-designed  policies  can  reverse  the  trends  projected  in  the  Outlook  Baseline
scenario,  safeguarding  long-term  economic  growth  and  the  well-being  of  future
generations. Given the complexity of the environmental challenges and the inter-linkages
among them, a  wide array of policy instruments  are needed, often in combination,  to
mainstream environmental considerations into economic decisions. Policy interventions
also need to be able to support sustainable growth and development. The OECD’s Green
Growth Strategy provides a coherent framework for assembling the best policy mix. Drawing
on  this,  the  Outlook  suggests  the  following  policy  priorities  to  tackle  climate  change,
biodiversity loss, water challenges and the health impacts from pollution.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Make pollution an expensive business

What if…

Economic instruments such as environmental taxes and emissions trading schemes
put a price on pollution and make activities that damage the environment more costly
than  greener alternatives (see for example, Chapter 3, Section 3). This can help to green
global supply and value chains, through
innovation  in  business  practices  and
greener technologies. Moreover, market-
bas e d   i n s t r u m e n t s   c a n   g e n e rat e
additional  fiscal  revenues  to  ease  tight
government  budgets.  A  number  of
countries  have  embarked  on  green  tax
reforms, often using the revenues raised
to reduce taxes on labour income which
could  help  boost  employment  and
encourage green growth.

… the emission reduction pledges that
industrialised countries indicated in  the
C a n c ú n   A g r e e m e n t s   w e r e   t o   b e
implemented  through  carbon  taxes  or
c a p - a n d - t ra d e   s ch e m e s   w i t h   f u l ly
auctioned  permits?  The  fiscal  revenues
could  amount  to  over  0.6%  of  their  GDP
in 2020, i.e. more than USD 250 billion.

Ensure prices better reflect the true value of natural assets and ecosystem services

Valuing and properly pricing resources and the ecosystem services they provide lead
to more sustainable use of these resources. For example, pricing is an effective way of
allocating  water,  particularly  where  it  is  scarce,  and  to  encourage  more  sustainable
consumption. Water tariffs can also generate revenues that can help to cover the costs of
water infrastructure, essential to ensuring continued and expanded access to water supply
and  sanitation  services  (see Chapter 5,  Section 3).  Economic  instruments  also  show
promise  with  respect  to  biodiversity  and other  ecosystem  services.  Estimating  the
monetary value of the services provided by ecosystems and biodiversity can make their
benefits more visible, and can lead to better, more cost-effective decisions (see Chapter 4,
Section 1). Creating markets to capture these values is also needed, for example through
tradable  water  rights,  payments  for ecosystem  services  for  forests  and  watersheds  or
through  the  use  of  eco-labelling  certification  schemes.  The  Convention  on  Biological
Diversity and the OECD are together seeking to increase the use of economic instruments
for biodiversity conservation and sustainable use.

Devise proactive and effective regulations and standards

Regulatory approaches are a cornerstone of environmental policy and can be used in
combination  with  economic  instruments,  in  particular  when  markets  cannot  deliver
meaningful price signals. For example, energy efficiency opportunities may not be fully
tapped through carbon pricing alone (Chapter 3, Section 3). Regulations will also be needed
where strict control is warranted to safeguard human health or environmental integrity,
for  example  through  quantitative  standards  or  limits  (see for  example  Chapter 6,
Sections 2 and 4). Examples of regulatory approaches include standards (e.g. for ambient
air quality, effluent discharges, and vehicle emissions standards, plus building codes for
energy efficiency); outright bans (e.g. on illegal logging and trading of endangered species,
development in natural protected areas, lead in gasoline and certain toxic pesticides); and
the  use  of  planning  tools  (such  as  land  use  planning  and  environmental  impact
assessments).

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Remove environmentally harmful subsidies

Support to fossil fuel 
production and use amounted 
to between USD 45-75 billion 
per annum in recent years in 
OECD countries. Developing 
and emerging economies 
provided over USD 400 billion 
in fossil fuel consumer 
subsidies in 2010.

Many  environmentally  harmful  activities  are
subsidised by taxpayers. Many countries, for instance,
still subsidise fossil fuel production or consumption to
some degree (see Chapter 3, section 3). This essentially
encourages carbon emissions, undermining efforts to
tackle  climate  change,  and  locking  in  yesterday’s
energy  technologies. Phasing  out  or  reforming  these
subsidies  can  reduce energy-related  GHG  emissions,
provide incentives for increased energy efficiency and
make  renewable  energy  more  competitive.  This  can
also  provide  new  sources  of  public  finance  to  support  climate  action.  Similarly,
underpriced or subsidised water as well as some poorly-designed agricultural and fisheries
subsidises have the potential to further stress land, water and ecosystems (see Chapter 4,
Section 4). Removing or reforming such subsidies can send vital signals about the true cost
of pollution and the value of natural assets. It can also save taxpayers or consumers money.
Addressing potential adverse impacts of subsidies reform is an essential element of any
move to price pollution and resources properly.

Encourage innovation

We need to significantly speed up the development and diffusion of technological
improvements that will curb growing pressures on the environment, and keep the future
cost of doing so manageable. For example, technologies such as bioenergy combined with
carbon  capture  and  storage  (BECCS)  have  the  potential  to  lower  the  future  cost  of
mitigating GHG emissions (see Chapter 3, Section 4). Innovation in new business models
also has a major role to play in providing solutions to key environmental challenges and
promoting green growth. For instance, improved farm management techniques can help
maximise  water  productivity  or  the  “crop  per  drop”  that  farmers  produce,  reduce
pollution and help protect biodiversity. The promotion of green or sustainable chemistry
can lead to the design, manufacture and use of more environmentally friendly chemicals
throughout their lifecycle (see Chapter 6, Section 4). Pricing and market-based instruments
can  provide  incentives  to  encourage  innovation  in  pollution-reducing  and  resource-
saving  technologies.  But  other  measures  are  also
needed,  such  as  specific  R&D  support  policies,
standards,  regulations  and  voluntary  programmes  to
encourage innovation, as well as effective mechanisms
for green technology transfer to developing countries.
But  innovation  is  not  only  about  technologies.  Policy
innovation  by  governments,  business  and  social
organisations  is  also  needed  to  spread  greener
production and consumption.

The economy will not 
decarbonise itself. Without 
new, more effective policies, 
the mix of energy technologies 
will not change significantly 
by 2050, with the share of 
fossil fuel-based energy 
remaining at 85%.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Get the policy mix right

Given the range of pressures and the complexity of interaction, a carefully designed
mix  of  policy  instruments  will  be  needed  to  tackle  many  of  the  key  environmental
challenges.  Government  support  for  “green”  behaviour  such  as  ecological  farming
techniques could be part of a policy mix, but such green subsidies should be periodically
reviewed and eventually phased out once the green practices have become well accepted.
A  policy  mix  can  include  information  tools,  such  as  eco-labelling,  to  raise  consumer
awareness and promote sustainable consumption; basic research and development; and
voluntary initiatives by business to experiment with new and innovative approaches. At
the same time, it will be important to ensure the policy instruments used in the mix are
complementary, and do not overlap or conflict (see below). The full costs and benefits of
policy mixes should be routinely assessed for environmental effectiveness, social equity
and cost-efficiency. There is no “one-size-fits-all” prescription for a green growth policy
mix, which needs to be adapted to specific national circumstances.

4. Making reform happen and mainstreaming green growth

Encourage policy coherence across sectors

Integrating environmental objectives in economic and sectoral policies (e.g. energy,
agriculture, transport) is vital, as these policies have greater impacts than environmental
policies alone. This lies at the heart of a greener growth path. Environmental challenges
cannot be addressed in isolation but should be assessed in the context of other global
challenges such as food and energy security and poverty alleviation. The Environmental
Outlook highlights, for example, the increasing need for coherence among water, agriculture,
environment  and  energy  policies  in  the  coming  decades  (see for  example  Chapter 5,
Section 4).  Policies  to  better  adapt  to  climate  change  or  to  protect  biodiversity  must
necessarily be part of land use, spatial planning, urban development, water and agriculture
policies, and vice versa. It is vital to make it worthwhile for the rural poor to protect rather
than  destroy  forests  by  mainstreaming  biodiversity  goals  into  poverty  reduction
programmes and economic development
strategies,  as  well  as  forestry  and
agricultural  policies  (see  for  example
Chapter 4,  Section 4).  Many  countries
have implemented or considered “green”
fiscal  reforms  to  reflect  environmental
goals  into  tax  and  national  budget
systems. Achieving policy  coherence  to
effectively  address  cross-cutting  policy
agenda requires a strengthened capacity
in governments to enhance co-operation
bet wee n  dif ferent  minist rie s  and
ag e n c i e s   a n d   d i f f e re n t   l eve l s   o f
government.

…  climate  mitigation  options  avoided
expansion  of  crop  areas  into  natural
ecosystems? The Outlook suggests that such
a   s c e n a r i o   wo u l d   c u t   c u mu l a t iv e
deforestation  emissions  by  12.7 GtC  and
contribute to  7% of the required emission
reduction  to 2050.  At  the  same  time,
biodiversity would be protected through a
reduction in the extent of cropland by some
1.2 million km2 and 1 million km2 less land
for  animal  grazing  by 2050  relative  to  the
Baseline. 

What if…

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Maximise policy synergies

There  are  many  inter-linkages  among  the  four  key  environmental  challenges
addressed  in this Environmental Outlook. Policies that are designed so as to maximise
synergies and co-benefits can lower the cost of meeting environmental objectives. For
example, some local air pollution abatement approaches can also reduce GHG emissions
(see Chapter 6, Box 6.3, and Chapter 3, Section 4). Climate mitigation policy can include
actions  that can also help  protect biodiversity.  For example, a well-designed financing
mechanism  for  “REDD-plus”  (Reducing  Emissions  from  Deforestation  and  Forest
Degradation) can mitigate climate change while delivering substantial  biodiversity  co-
benefits  since  avoided  deforestation  and  degradation  implies  a  decline  in  habitat
destruction (Chapter 4, Box 4.9). The  Outlook also highlights the green growth potential
from  tackling  these  environmental  challenges,  including  poverty  alleviation,  fiscal
consolidation and job creation.

What if…

Contradictory policies can undermine progress,  and  these  need to be carefully
monitored and addressed. For example, large-scale water infrastructure projects such as
dams  –  intended  to  improve  water  and
energy security and better regulate river
flows – can disrupt wildlife habitats and
ecosystem balance, with negative impacts
on  biodiveristy  as  well  as  compromised
water quality downstream (see Chapter 5,
Sections 2 and 4). Increasing the use of
biofuels to meet climate goals could have
negative impacts on biodiversity (Chapter 4,
Box 4.9).  For  the  poorest  households  in
developing countries, dirty solid  biofuels
(e.g. cow dung, firewood) that cause indoor
air  pollution  will  remain  attractive  for
cooking and heating if carbon taxes place
relatively cleaner fuels beyond their reach
(Chapter 6, Box 6.4).

… the social impacts of climate mitigation
policy were not properly addressed? The
Outlook climate mitigation scenario suggests
that,  without  accompanying  policies  to
address energy access, increased energy
costs could lead to an additional 300 million
poor  people  lacking  access  to  clean  but
more  expensive  energy  sources  in 2050,
causing 300 000 more premature deaths
from indoor air pollution than under the
Baseline scenario. Targeted policies would be
needed to provide alternative clean energy
for poor households. 

Work in partnerships

Governments need to  work  more  effectively  with  non-government  actors  such  as
businesses, civil society organisations, the scientific research community and holders of
traditional knowledge. Especially  when  government resources are constrained, forging
strategic partnerships and capitalising on the dynamism of the larger society can help
achieve green growth. OECD experience shows that environmental policy reforms work
best when high-level political leaders are committed and all stakeholders are involved.
In  particular,  businesses  and  research  institutions  play  key  roles  in  advancing  green
technology options and in developing sustainable farming practices. Further engagement
by  the  private  sector  is  needed  in  biodiversity  and  ecosystem  management  and  in
investing in clean energy and water infrastructure development. Innovative financing, at
national and international levels, will be necessary to achieve this.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Gear up international co-operation

What if…

As many of the environmental problems are global in nature (e.g. biodiversity loss and
climate change)  or linked to the trans-boundary effects of economic globalisation  (e.g.
trade,  international  investment),  international  co-operation  at  all  levels  (bilateral,
regional, and multilateral) is indispensable to ensure an equitable sharing of the cost of
action.  For  example,  while  the  world’s  mega-biodiverse  areas  are  mainly  located  in
developing countries, the burden of biodiversity conservation measures needs to be shared
more  broadly,  given  that  the  benefits  of  biodiversity  accrue  globally  (see Chapter 4,
Section 1). This calls for strategies to mobilise international financing (including REDD) to
support efforts to conserve and sustainably
manage  biodiversity  in  these  regions,  as
well  as  to  monitor  progress  towards
implementation.  Such  efforts  can  also
contribute  to  alleviating  poverty  and
promoting  sustainable  development.
Similarly,  international  financing  for  low
carbon climate-resilient growth will need
to be scaled up significantly in the coming
years.  The  Outlook  suggests  that  it  is
possible  to  raise  considerable  additional
revenues  from  market-based  climate  mitigation  measures;  just  a  small  part  of  such
revenues could make a significant contribution to the finance needed for climate action
(see Chapter 3, Box 3.11). International co-operation is also needed to channel financial
resources  and  know-how  for  providing  universal  access  to  safe  water  and  adequate
sanitation, an objective that is far more ambitious than the MDGs (Chapter 5, Section 3).
The Outlook shows that benefits will far outweigh the costs.

…  the  global  community  decided  to
promote universal access to an improved
water source and basic sanitation in two
phases by 2050?  The Outlook  suggests  an
additional  investment  of  USD  1.9 billion
per  year  would  be needed between 2010
and 2030,  then  USD  7.6 billion  annually
to 2050 compared to Baseline. 

More ambitious international 
co-operation on climate change 
needs to include the 
participation of all major 
emitting sectors and countries. 
Fragmented carbon markets 
and uneven levels of 
mitigation efforts may give rise 
to competitiveness and 
“carbon leakage” concerns.

International  agreements  are  instrumental  in
providing  the  legal  and  institutional  basis  for
international environmental co-operation. For example,
the  Outlook  highlights  the  recent  progress  by  the
Convention  on  Biological  Diversity  in 2010  on  the
Strategic  Plan  for  Biodiversity 2011-2020  (the  Aichi
Biodiversity  Targets,  the  Resource  Mobilization
Strategy,  etc.)  and  the  Nagoya  Protocol  on  Access  to
Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing
of  Benefits  Arising  from  their  Utilization.  National
governments’  commitment  to  the  UN  Strategic
Approach to International Chemicals Management (SAICM) is bringing about international
co-operation for the safe management of chemicals to safeguard human health and the
environment  (see Chapter 6,  Box 6.9).  Ambitious  and  comprehensive  international
frameworks are essential to address climate change mitigation and adaptation, with the
participation  of all major emitters as  well  as  those who are most vulnerable  to global
warming. In the absence of internationally co-ordinated action and a global carbon price,
concerns  regarding  competitiveness  impacts  and  carbon  leakage  are  a  barrier  to  the
implementation of national mitigation policies. For water, strong mechanisms are required
to  manage  river  basins  that  cross  national  borders.  In  addition,  trade,  foreign  direct
investment  and  multinational  enterprises  can  be  mobilised  to  foster  international

32

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

co-operation.  Other  mechanisms  should  be  systematically  explored  to  stimulate  and
create larger markets for eco-innovation.

Improve our knowledge

Biodiversity and ecosystems 
provide invaluable but largely 
unvalued services to people 
and the natural environment. 
For example, the economic 
value of pollination services 
provided by insects worldwide 
is estimated at some 
USD 192 billion per year.

Better  information  supports  better  policies.
Assessments  of  policies  and  projects  should  be
routinely carried out to evaluate their environmental
and social impacts. Improved hydrological monitoring
networks  are necessary  to  observe  long-term  trends
and to evaluate the effect of policy actions. Progress is
also needed on data and indicators for biodiversity to
enable  more  co-ordinated  and  comprehensive
biodiversity policies at local, national and international
levels.  More  information  is  also  needed  on  releases
from, and exposure to, chemicals in products and in the environment, as well as on other
emerging environmental and health issues which are still poorly understood. Monitoring
of climate change impacts will need to improve to identify priorities for action and inform
adaptation  planning.  There  are  many  areas  where  economic  valuation  should  be
improved, including the benefits of biodiversity and ecosystem services, and health
costs associated with exposure to chemicals. This will help to measure those elements of
improved  human  welfare  and  progress  that  cannot  be  captured  by  GDP  alone.  Better
information on costs and benefits will help to improve our understanding of the costs of
inaction,  and  make  a  strong  case  for  green  growth  policy  reforms  and  indicator
development.

5. Conclusion

The implementation of effective green growth policy mixes will depend on political
leadership and on widespread public acceptance that changes are both necessary and
affordable. Not all of the solutions will be cheap, which is why seeking out the most cost-
effective  among them  is  so  important.  A  key task  is  to  improve understanding  of  the
challenges and trade-offs that need to be made. This Outlook seeks to contribute to the
need for a better-informed basis for decision making, and hopes to provide policy makers
actionable policy options for today that can help to put the world on a more sustainable
path.

Introduction

This chapter provides background to the OECD Environmental Outlooks, explains
the methodology used – including the traffic light system – and outlines the report
structure.  It focuses on the four “Red  light” environmental  challenges – climate
change, biodiversity, water, and the health impacts of environmental pollution –
identified as the most pressing challenges in the coming decades. The analysis in the
Environmental Outlook is global, but its policy recommendations focus on OECD
countries and the key emerging economies of Brazil, Russia, India, Indonesia, China
and  South  Africa  (the  “BRIICS”).  The  Environmental  Outlook  makes  future
projections to analyse economic and environmental trends over the coming decades,
by combining a general equilibrium economic modelling framework (the OECD’s
ENV-Linkages model) with a comprehensive environmental modelling framework
(the  IMAGE  suite of models  of  the  PBL  Netherlands Environmental Assessment
Agency).  The Environmental  Outlook’s  Baseline  scenario  presents  stylised
projections of what the world could look like in 2050 if current socio-economic and
environmental trends and existing policies are maintained, but no new policies are
introduced  to  protect  the  environment.  To  compare  against  the  Baseline,  the
Outlook also presents  the results  of  “what  if…”  simulations  which  model the
potential effects of policies designed to tackle key environmental problems. This
edition of the Outlook has been prepared for the Environment Ministers’ Meeting at
the OECD in March 2012, and as an OECD input to the United Nations Conference
on  Sustainable  Development  (Rio+20)  in  June 2012.  It  is  designed  to  be  read
alongside the OECD’s green growth strategy, Towards Green Growth.

INTRODUCTION

1. Introduction

Since 2001, the OECD has produced a series of Environmental Outlooks to help policy
makers understand the scale and context of the environmental challenges they face in the
coming decades, as well as the economic and environmental implications of the policies
that could be used to address these challenges (OECD, 2001; 2008). The Outlooks use models
to make projections about what the world might look like in the future. They also present
the results of “what if…” simulations which model the potential effects of policies designed to
tackle key environmental problems. 

This Environmental Outlook looks as far ahead as 2050, and in some cases to 2100. It
focuses on the four “Red light” environmental challenges – climate change, biodiversity,
water,  and  the  health  impacts  of  environmental  pollution –  identified  by  OECD
environment ministers  in 20081  as  the most pressing and  persistent challenges  in  the
coming decades (Box 1.1).

Box 1.1. The OECD Environmental Outlook traffic lights

The OECD Environmental Outlooks use red, yellow and green traffic light icons to highlight the
magnitude and direction of pressures on the environment as well as trends in policy
development to respond to these environmental problems. The ratings were determined by
the experts drafting the chapters, and then refined or confirmed by Delegates of the OECD
Environment Policy Committee and its sub-groups reviewing the report. They represent the
following ratings:

Red lights indicate environmental issues or pressures that require urgent attention,
either because recent trends have been negative and are expected to continue to be so
in the future without new policies, or because the trends have been stable recently but
are expected to worsen.
Yellow lights indicate those pressures or environmental conditions whose impact is
uncertain or changing (e.g. from a positive or stable trend toward a potentially negative
projection); or which have been well managed in the past but are less so now; or which
remain a challenge but have the potential for a more positive outlook with the right
policies.
Green lights indicate pressures that have stabilised at an acceptable level or are
decreasing; environmental conditions for which the outlook to 2050 is positive; or
positive policy developments to address these pressures and conditions.

The traffic light scheme is a simple, clear communication device. However, it must be
remembered that it is a simplification of the often complex environmental pressures, states
and responses examined in this Outlook.

INTRODUCTION

This edition of the Outlook has been prepared for the Environment Ministers’ Meeting
at the OECD in March 2012, and as an OECD input to the United Nations Conference on
Sustainable Development (Rio+20) in June 2012. It is designed to be read alongside the
OECD’s  green  growth  strategy,  Towards  Green  Growth  (OECD, 2011),  which  outlines  an
analytical  framework  to  underpin  economic  and  environmental  policies  that  are
mutually  supportive  so  as  to  avoid  the  possibility  that  the  mismanagement  of  natural
assets  could  ultimately  undermine  ongoing  human  development.  While  the  green
growth  strategy  provides  a  generic  “policy  toolkit” applicable to different countries and
issues, the Environmental Outlook  contains  specific policy  options for  addressing  climate
change,  biodiversity  loss,  poor  water  quality  and  quantity  and  the  health  impacts  of
pollution. These policy options are based on projections and analyses of the environmental
and economic impacts of specific policies and the synergies and trade-offs between them
(Box 1.2).  Thus,  the Outlook  aims  to  support  the  international  policy  debates  on  these
specific  issues.  The  analysis  in  the  Environmental  Outlook  is  global,  but  its  policy
recommendations focus on OECD countries and the key emerging economies of Brazil,
Russia, India, Indonesia, China and South Africa (the “BRIICS”). The recommendations bear
in mind the need to make continuing progress towards the global goals of sustainable
development and poverty alleviation.

This Environmental Outlook is also intended to reach beyond the environment policy
community.  The  key  environmental  challenges  discussed  here  cannot  be  solved  by
environment ministries alone. Approaches that enable green growth need to be an integral
part of economic and sectoral policies. Business, the scientific community, consumers and
civil society at large also have important roles to play in promoting green growth.

Box 1.2. Coherent policies for green growth

Many of the environmental objectives discussed in the separate chapters of this Outlook
are  inter-related –  for  example,  climate  change  can  damage  biodiversity  and  human
health. A key role of the Outlook is to highlight these inter-linkages and to draw attention
to  both  the  synergies  and  trade-offs  in  policies  targeted  at  a  specific  environmental
challenge. Examples show how policies which address at least two of the challenges at
once in a synergistic way may lower the cost of meeting some environmental objectives
(e.g. tackling climate change can also reduce air pollution; Chapter 3). Other examples
show  how contradictory policies could  undermine progress, e.g.  increasing the  use  of
biofuels to meet climate goals could have negative impacts on biodiversity (Chapter 4). The
Outlook  also  highlights  the  green  growth  potential  offered  from  tackling  these
environmental challenges – including poverty  alleviation,  fiscal  consolidation  and  job
creation.

2. The Outlook methodology

Linking economic and environmental modelling

The OECD Environmental Outlook analyses economic and environmental trends over the
coming decades. These projections are made possible by combining a general equilibrium
economic modelling framework (the OECD’s ENV-Linkages model) with a comprehensive
environmental modelling framework (the IMAGE suite of models of the PBL Netherlands
Environmental Assessment Agency). Further details of the ENV-Linkages and the IMAGE

INTRODUCTION

suite of models, as well as information and data sources, are provided in Annex A on the
Modelling Framework at the end of this report.

■ The  ENV-Linkages  model  developed  by  the  OECD  Environment  Directorate  is  a  global
dynamic  computable general  equilibrium (CGE)  model that describes how  economic
activities  are  linked  to  each  other  between  sectors  and  across  regions.  It  also  links
economic activity to environmental pressure, specifically to emissions of greenhouse
gases  (GHGs).  These  links  between  economic  activities  and  emissions  are projected
several decades into the future, and thus shed light on the impacts of environmental
policies for the medium- and long-term future. This model was used to make projections
of key socio-economic drivers such as demographic developments, economic growth
and developments in economic sectors (discussed in Chapter 2).2

■ The IMAGE (Integrated Model to Assess the Global Environment) suite of models run by
the PBL is a dynamic integrated assessment framework to model global change. The
IMAGE  suite  is  underpinned  by  modelling  of  global  land  allocation  and  emissions,
mapped onto a geospatial 0.5 x 0.5 degree3 grid of the world (thus results for small areas
or specific countries are less robust than for larger countries and regions). The IMAGE
suite comprises models that also appear in the literature as models in their own right,
and it has been used for other key global environmental assessments such as the Global
Environmental Outlooks (GEOs) by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP).
IMAGE has also been further developed and refined since the OECD Environmental Outlook
to 2030 (OECD, 2008) and is now better equipped to analyse, among other things, water-
related issues, protected areas and the marine environment.

The key socio-economic trends (“Economy”) to 2050 emerging from the ENV-Linkages
model were fed into the IMAGE models to make projections of biophysical environmental
consequences (“Environment”) as depicted in Figure 1.1. In this way, the economy and the
environment were connected through energy, agriculture and land use. Modelling of land
and  energy  use  provides  the  key  connections  between  the  economic  and  biophysical
models. The biophysical projections from IMAGE are then used in ENV-Linkages to specify
policies and assess their economic implications. The data flows between ENV-Linkages and
the IMAGE suite were used to develop the OECD Environmental Outlook Baseline projections
as well as the policy simulations which are discussed below.

INTRODUCTION

One “Baseline” – many policy simulations

The OECD Environmental Outlook’s Baseline scenario presents stylised projections  of
what the world could look like in 2050 if current socio-economic and environmental trends
and existing policies are maintained, but no new policies are introduced to protect the
environment. The Baseline does  not  reflect major future  developments in policies that
affect either the drivers of environmental change or environmental pressures. It should be
stressed that the Baseline is not supposed to be a prediction of what the world will look like
(as it is likely that new policies will be introduced in the coming decades), but rather a
hypothetical  projection  forward  of  current  trends  without  new  policies  (see Chapter 2,
Box 2.1) against which to compare different policy scenarios.

The Baseline scenario does reflect current trends and existing policies, such as fossil and
renewable energy policies, biofuel support programmes and agricultural support policies, to
name a few. Existing trends in efficiency or productivity improvements, in some cases due to
earlier policies and measures, are also assumed to continue in the Baseline. Selected examples
of the types of trends and existing policies that are reflected in the Baseline scenario are
summarised in Table 1.1, and discussed further in the relevant chapters.

1. For example, the EU Emissions Trading Scheme Phase 2 (i.e. until 2012) is currently in force and is thus included
in the Baseline. Phase 3, which is not yet implemented, is not included in the Baseline, but instead reflected in
policy simulations of future mitigation action.

Because the Baseline reflects no new policies, it has been used in this Outlook as a reference
scenario  against  which  model-based  simulations  of  new  policies  are  compared.  The
differences between the Baseline projections and policy simulations have been analysed to
shed light on their economic and environmental impacts. These simulations are meant to be
illustrative rather than prescriptive. They indicate the type and magnitude of the responses

Geographical and temporal scope

While this Environmental Outlook is based on the analysis of long-term global trends
to 2050, one goal is to identify trends and policy options for OECD countries and the BRIICS.
The Outlook model projections are presented using different levels of regional aggregation or
country groups depending on their relevance for particular topics. The three most commonly
used groups throughout the report are the OECD, BRIICS, rest of the world (or RoW), and
15 regional clusters. These are shown in Table 1.3, which also shows how the country groups
under the different models are equivalent to each other. Other groupings or selections of
countries are also used to illustrate trends in different chapters. For example, in the Climate
Change Chapter, “Annex I” countries refer to industrialised countries that are part of Annex I
of the Kyoto Protocol under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (see Chapter 3).

In the IMAGE model, India means “India region”, which also includes Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Maldives,
Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, when dealing with land use, biodiversity, water and health. For energy-related
modelling, the region has been split into India (country) and the “Rest of South Asia”. Similarly, the Southern
Africa region includes ten other countries in this geographical area, including the Republic of South Africa, when
dealing with land use, biodiversity, water and health. For energy-related modelling, the region has been split into
the Republic of South Africa and “Rest of Southern Africa”.

Various timeframes relevant to specific goals and objectives, e.g. 2015, 2020, 2030, 2050, are
presented in this report. For the projections of climate change impacts and analysis of policy
options, the time horizon is extended to 2100. In some of the chapters, policy actions in the
medium term (e.g. from “today” up to 2020 or 2030) and long term (from 2020 or 2030 up
to 2050) are compared to draw further insights. The base year is 2010, unless otherwise stated.

Embracing uncertainties

A good  dose of humility is warranted when making any model-based projections,
especially for long-term projections decades into the future. This Environmental Outlook is
no  exception.  Many  mechanisms  that  drive  long-term  economic  growth  and
environmental pressure are not well understood. This means that there are uncertainties
about the data input, and the relationships between drivers and environmental pressures
assumed in the models (Box 1.3). There are also likely to be shocks, such as a profound or
prolonged economic crises (see Chapter 2, Box 2.2) or natural disasters, which cannot be
foreseen or included in these long-term projections. There are uncertainties surrounding
scientific data, notably where environmental thresholds and tipping points might lie.

INTRODUCTION

Box 1.3. Important sources of model uncertainty

Uncertainty in the model parameters: Model parameters are estimated or calibrated from
empirical sources. Hence, there is statistical uncertainty in the value of the parameters.
These  uncertainties  are  often  handled  by  examining  the  impact  of  small  changes  in
parameters on the model’s results through sensitivity analyses. They often demonstrate
that while quantitative results from the model can change with revisions to parameters, the
qualitative results and conclusions drawn from them are much harder to overturn.

Uncertainty in the drivers: A model requires projections of future drivers such as demographic
or technological change to underpin its results. Uncertainty in the drivers translates directly
into uncertainty in the model projections. When studying particular policy agendas, the range
of uncertainty can be narrowed by focusing attention on key alternatives to a reference case
(i.e. the Baseline) that are most important for the policy issues under consideration. A starting
point for looking at those alternatives would be to examine variations in the key drivers of the
Baseline. For example, the 2008 edition of the OECD Environmental Outlook explored variations in
the aggregate productivity of countries. By focusing on the relative change or differences
between the Baseline projections and policy simulations, rather than on absolute levels,
outcomes are less sensitive to actual Baseline projections. 

Uncertainty in the model structure: There are numerous theories that can be used to underpin
a model’s structure. A choice is made between analytical paradigms that distinguish different
schools of thought. The computable general equilibrium (CGE) modelling framework (used for
this Outlook) is a popular analytical tool for understanding economic phenomena. In practice,
proper validation is a formidable task and beyond the scope of this Outlook. Projections are
conditional on these model choices. This area of uncertainty is more likely to change
qualitative results: different models will give different results.

However,  these  uncertainties  do  not  need  to  be  seen  as  limitations.  Instead,  this
Outlook attempts to “embrace” uncertainties, as they can help to shed further light on the
interactions between the economy and the environment and to identify where further
work is needed to  improve the knowledge base. Each  of the thematic chapters  of  this
Outlook outlines the uncertainties surrounding the theme, and discusses what they might
mean for policy makers.

Where appropriate, the Environmental Outlook Baseline projections are compared with
other model-based scenarios in the literature. Where the different models used for the
Outlook were able to address the same issues (for example GHG emissions are modelled in
ENV-Linkages  and  IMAGE),  the  results  from  the  different  models  are  compared  and
discussed. Comparing results from different modelling frameworks helps to understand
the differences between models and to identify the ranges of estimates. Also, uncertainties
surrounding  the feasibility  of policy  options  (in  terms  of  political  and  public  support,
technological potential or costs) are addressed through simulations of a number of policy
variants, as done in Chapter 3 on climate change.

3. How is the report structured?

The  next  chapter,  Chapter 2,  presents  the  underlying  socio-economic  drivers  of
environmental changes discussed in the later thematic environmental chapters. The first
part  describes  the  key  socio-economic  drivers  that  affect  economic  development  and
environmental  change  to 2050,  including  population  dynamics  and  labour  markets,

INTRODUCTION

urbanisation,  and  economic  growth.  This  chapter  also  discusses  key  economic
developments that most directly affect the environment, namely energy and land use.

The Outlook then features four chapters on the key environmental challenges: climate
change  (Chapter 3),  biodiversity  (Chapter 4),  water  (Chapter 5),  and  health  and
environment  (Chapter 6).  Each  discusses  key  environmental  trends  and  the  Baseline
projections to 2050, i.e what the future might look like without new policies. Some of these
are modelled while others are addressed qualitatively. Given the availability of data and the
limitations  of  the  modelling  framework,  the  relative  coverage  of  quantitative  versus
qualitative  analyses  differs  from  chapter  to  chapter.  Wherever  possible,  the  costs  of
inaction in the face of these environmental challenges are discussed, drawing on available
information in the literature.

Each chapter then reviews the policy options and recent policy progress for tackling the
issue, before outlining further action needed and any emerging issues. The findings from the
policy simulations are presented to illustrate the discussions of policy options. Where possible,
specific country examples are also given. A box containing the key messages summarises the
main findings and policy options at the beginning of each chapter.

Annex  A  on the Modelling  Framework  at the end  of  this  report complements  the
discussion of the methodology used for this Environmental Outlook, and provides further
technical  details  on  the  modelling  framework.  In-depth  technical  discussions  of  the
modelling assumptions used for policy simulations are also presented in relevant chapter
annexes. In addition, technical background papers accompany this Environmental Outlook
as OECD Environment Working Papers.

Notes
1. The 2008 Environmental Outlook (OECD, 2008) projected ahead to 2030 and covered a wider range of
environmental  challenges  and  their  drivers  than  this  Outlook.  However,  OECD  environment
ministers asked the OECD to focus the new Environmental Outlook on these four key red light issues.
This  Outlook  also  extends  projections  to 2050  and  takes  stock  of  recent  progress  at  the
international  and  national levels  in  implementing policies to  address  the  four  environmental
challenges.  The  models  used  for  the  analyses  for  this  Outlook  have  been  further  refined  and
updated. 

2. Since  the 2008  edition  of  the  OECD  Environmental  Outlook  (OECD,  2008),  the  ENV-Linkages  model
was further developed and refined for analysis as published in the Economics of Climate Change
Mitigation (OECD, 2009), which assessed the environmental effectiveness and economic costs of
different  policies  and policy  mixes  to reduce  global  greenhouse gas emissions.  More recently,
ENV-Linkages  has  been  further  refined  to support  work requested  by  the 2009  G20 Pittsburgh
Summit  to  model  the  impact  of  removing  fossil  fuel  subsidies.  For  this  Environmental  Outlook
to 2050, ENV-Linkages has been further developed, refined and updated (e.g. using more recent
data  for  economic  activity  and  energy  use,  and  to  reflect  the  economic  crisis  of 2008-2009,
see Chapter 2).

Socio-economic Developments

Rob Dellink, Ton Manders (PBL), Jean Chateau, Bertrand Magné,

Detlef van Vuuren (PBL), Anne Gerdien Prins (PBL)

The chapter starts by describing current demographic trends and corresponding
Baseline projections (notably for population growth/composition including ageing,
and  urbanisation).  It  then  outlines  economic  trends  and  projections,  including
economic growth (GDP, consumption, sectoral composition) and its drivers, such as
labour and capital. These trends are based on a gradual conditional convergence of
income levels among countries. In its final section it explores two factors which
directly link economic trends to environmental pressures: energy use (energy mix
such as fossil fuels, renewables and nuclear) and land use (in particular agricultural
land). The projected key socio-economic developments under the Environmental
Outlook Baseline scenario presented in this chapter serve as the basis for the
environmental projections described in the other chapters of this Outlook.  The
chapter focuses on global projections for major world regions such as the group of
OECD countries, emerging economies of Brazil, Russia, India, Indonesia, China and
South Africa (the BRIICS) and the rest of the world.

KEY MESSAGES

This chapter explores how global and regional economic growth, population, labour force participation,

urbanisation, energy and land use could develop by 2050 if no new policies are introduced. The projected
key socio-economic  developments under the Environmental Outlook Baseline  scenario presented in this
chapter serve as the basis for the environmental projections described in the other chapters of this Outlook.
The overall finding is that the Baseline scenario (i.e. business as usual) is not a viable pathway for future
development, as it leads to substantial environmental pressure and considerable costs.
■ World gross domestic product (GDP) is projected to nearly quadruple over the coming four decades, in
line with the past 40 years. By 2050, the OECD’s share of the global economy is projected to decline from
54% in 2010 to less than 32%, while the share of Brazil, Russia, India, Indonesia, China and South Africa
(the BRIICS) is projected to grow to more than 40%. The US economy, which has been the largest in the
world, as measured by GDP and expressed in purchasing power parity exchange rates (PPPs), is projected
to be overtaken by China around 2012. India’s GDP is projected to surpass that of the United States
before 2040. Today’s global “engines of growth” – China and India – could see their average GDP growth
rates slow down to 2050, while remaining well above the average growth rate of the OECD region. The
Baseline projects that Africa will experience high economic growth rates between 2030 and 2050, but will
remain the poorest continent.

■ There are significant differences in demographic developments across regions and countries. By 2050,
the world population is projected to grow by another 2.2 billion people, reaching almost 9.2 billion. Most
of this growth will occur in South Asia, the Middle East and especially Africa. The population profiles of
all regions are ageing, especially China and the OECD countries.

environmental conditions in slums, with serious consequences for human health.

■ Under  the  Baseline  scenario,  world  energy  demand  in 2050  is  projected  to  be  about  80%  higher  than
today. The 2050 global (commercial) energy mix is not projected to differ significantly from today’s, with
fossil fuels still providing about 85%, renewable sources (including biofuels, but not traditional biomass)
providing just above 10%, and the remainder provided by nuclear. Of fossil fuels, it is uncertain whether
coal or gas will be the main source of increased energy supply.

■ Globally, the area of agricultural land is projected to expand in the next decade to match the increase in
food  demand  from  a  growing  population,  intensifying  competition  for  land.  Agricultural  land  is
expected  to  peak  before 2030  and  decline  thereafter,  as  population  growth  slows  down  and  yield
improvements  continue.  Deforestation  rates  are  already  declining,  and  this  trend  is  projected  to
continue, especially after 2030 when demand for more agricultural land eases.

1. Introduction

This chapter describes the main socio-economic drivers of environmental change that
underlie the key environmental concerns of this Outlook: economic growth, demographic
changes, labour force participation, urbanisation, energy and land use. All these drivers
have been modelled under the Environmental Outlook business-as-usual Baseline scenario to
see how they might develop by 2050 if no new policies are put in place.

The  chapter  starts  by  describing  current  demographic  trends  and  the  Baseline
projections (notably population  growth/composition  and urbanisation) (see Box 2.1).  It
then outlines economic trends and projections. These trends are based upon a gradual
convergence of income levels among countries (Box 2.3).1 In its final section it explores two
factors which directly link economic trends to environmental pressures: energy use and
land use. 

Box 2.1. Projection, not prediction

A baseline projection is not a prediction of future developments (Chapter 1). Instead it
constructs expected future trends for several key economic and environmental variables
based on current trends and a number of assumptions about the future. The Environmental
Outlook Baseline assumes no new policies for the environmental issues addressed in the
Outlook, but implicitly includes other government policies in the projected trends for the
key  variables.  It  thus  provides  a  benchmark  against  which  policy  scenarios  aimed  at
improving environmental quality for the issues under investigation can be assessed. 

Environmental pressure, the cost of inaction and green growth

The  Baseline  projection  presented  in  this Outlook  implies  severe  environmental
pressures. As will be discussed below and in subsequent chapters, these pressures pose
important risks and expected costs that could erode the natural capital base upon which
economic growth is built. For this reason, the Baseline cannot be considered to be a viable
pathway for future development. 

Although the nature of these impacts is beset with uncertainty, the implications of not
taking  action  to  address  the  environmental  pressures,  and  failing  to  account  for  the
environmental  consequences  of  economic  activities,  are  potentially  very  large.  OECD
(2008a)  provides  an overview of the cost of inaction  on  key environmental  challenges,
including  climate  change,  water  pollution  and  environment-related  health  issues.
Essential insights from that overview include the following: i) “defining and measuring the
cost  of  inaction  is  complex”,  especially  for  intangible  environmental  impacts;  and
ii) “despite the measurement difficulties, existing literature suggests very strongly that the
costs of policy inaction in selected environmental areas can be considerable”. Each of the
thematic chapters in this OECD Environmental Outlook to 2050 highlights the impacts of a

48

OECD ENVIRONMENTAL OUTLOOK TO 2050 © OECD 2012

2. SOCIO-ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS

Baseline projection when no policy action is taken and assesses costs of inaction based on
insights from the literature.

If the costs of taking no action to address the key environmental challenges were fully
included  in  this  assessment,  future  GDP  would  be  lower  than  projected  under  the
Environmental  Outlook  Baseline  discussed  below.  By  the  same  token,  the  benefits  of
environmental actions may be underestimated. In terms of the physical consequences of
inaction, the links between the environmental pressures and impacts for the different
environmental issues have been included in the Outlook analysis. For example, changes in
temperature  and  precipitation  patterns  induced  by  climate  change  affect  agricultural
productivity.  This  in  turn  increases  agricultural  land  requirements  and  pressures  to
deforest, which may aggravate biodiversity losses. Continuing business-as-usual under the
Baseline scenario risks exceeding biophysical limits or tipping points, and causing other
non-linear large-scale (systemic) irreversible damages (see Chapter 3, Section 2; Chapter 4,
Box 4.1).

Clearly, a transition is needed towards greener growth (OECD, 2011) in order to avoid
the  unchecked  environmental  consequences  of  the  socio-economic  developments
presented in this chapter. The following chapters in this Outlook deal extensively with how
such transitions towards greener growth can be made.

2. Key trends and projections

Demographic developments

Population  dynamics  are  key  drivers  of  local  and  global  environmental  change.
Growing populations lead to increases in the consumption of natural resources and in land
use, posing additional environmental pressures. Changes in wealth and age structure also
modify lifestyle, consumption habits and diet, all of which can have consequences for the
environment. The proportion of elderly versus young people in a population also affects the
labour  market,  which  is  one  of  the  main  drivers  of  economic  growth  –  along  with
technological progress, human capital improvements and physical capital accumulation.
This section outlines how some of these factors are projected to develop to 2050 under the
Baseline scenario.

 Population growth and composition

The world’s population has increased from less than 4 billion in 1970 to 7 billion today
(Figure 2.1). By 2050, the United Nations projects global population to be almost 9.2 billion
– an additional 2.2 billion people.2

There are significant regional and country differences in the projected demographic
developments  to 2050.  Population  growth  rates  are  assumed  to  be  low  in  the  OECD
countries (0.2% per year between 2010 and 2050, on average), with population even falling
in Japan, Korea and some European countries. However, in countries like the United States
and Canada, immigration is projected to continue to increase population levels. For the
“BRIICS” countries (Brazil, Russia, India, Indonesia, China and South Africa), population is
projected to grow at 0.4% per year on average, although growth rates are likely to be higher
in India, while Russia’s growth looks to be negative. Most of the population growth (on
average +1.3% per year) in the coming decades is projected to take place in the non-BRIICS
or developing countries (“Rest of the World” or RoW group). Within this group, growth rates
are projected to be higher in Africa and South Asia than in Latin America.

Figure 2.2 illustrates how the population in OECD countries has aged since 1970: the
share of children in the total population has steadily declined, while the share of elderly
people  has  increased.  Recent trends  in  fertility  rates  and  life  expectancy  suggest  that
similar patterns are appearing in Russia and China. According to the UN (2009) projections,
population ageing will only become prominent in the RoW group after 2030. Ageing implies
changes in lifestyle and consumption patterns, and diminishes the labour force (see below,
Figure 2.7). Ageing also has implications for health care and other services. In general,
these trends lead to a more than proportional increase in the demand for such services
(see also the section on the sectoral structure of the economy below).

 Urbanisation

The  world’s  population  is  becoming  increasingly  urbanised  (Figure 2.3).  In 1970,
1.3 billion people, or 36% of the world population, lived in urban areas. By 2009 that share
had reached 50%. This  trend  is  expected  to continue  in the  coming  decades,  reaching
nearly  70%  in 2050  (UN, 2010).  The  increase in  absolute  numbers  to 2050 is  2.8 billion,
which implies that the total world population growth between 2010 and 2050 (more than
2.2 billion  people)  would  be  completely  absorbed  by  urban  areas.  Rural  population  is
projected to decrease by 0.6 billion people over the same period. This growth in urban
population is expected to be unevenly distributed around the world. The share of urban
population in OECD countries is projected to be about 86% of total population by 2050. In
Sub-Saharan Africa, one of the least urbanised regions, urban dwellers accounted for about
37% of total population in 2010 – however, their share is projected to reach 60% by 2050.

Small urban centres of less than 0.5 million inhabitants are projected to grow more
rapidly than other urban areas (Figure 2.4). This would be a change from the observed trend
in recent decades, when large mega-cities grew at the fastest rates (UN Habitat, 2006). 

Urbanisation has both positive and negative environmental consequences. On the
positive side, up to a certain level, the concentration of activities in urban areas can allow
for economies of  scale and  easier interactions,  meaning that urbanisation  can lead  to
higher  economic  growth.  Higher  concentrations  of  people  generally  make  it  easier  to
provide access to modern and efficient infrastructure for the delivery of energy and water
services. On the  negative  side,  a greater concentration of economic  activities  can also
cause higher levels of outdoor air pollution (Chapter 6). Urbanisation also requires adapted
transportation policies to avoid major complications in the transport system, and negative
environmental implications can result from traffic congestion. Furthermore, one in every
three city  dwellers  worldwide  – about  one billion people – lives in a  slum  (UN Habitat,
2003 and 2006). Urban slums – with substandard housing and inadequate water, sanitation
and waste management services – have negative consequences for human health and the
environment.  This  could  become  magnified  with  further  urbanisation  unless  more

ambitious urban development and environmental management policies are put in place.
This is especially so as the number of people living in slums could well grow, despite the
projected increase in average GDP levels. 

Economic growth

Economic growth and rising per capita income, if based on the increased use of natural
resources, may exacerbate pressures on the environment. But other sources of growth,
such as technological progress (innovation) or improvements in education and human
skills,  can  decouple  environmental  pressures  from  economic  growth.  This  section
discusses the degree to which the global economy will grow over the next four decades, the
drivers of this growth and the implications.

How and where will the global economy grow to 2050?

The global  economy, measured  by real  gross  domestic  product (GDP), has  roughly
tripled in the past four decades.3 In the coming decades, world economic growth is likely
to continue these historical trends, but the distribution of this growth across countries is
projected  to  differ  significantly.  Until  the  end  of  the  20th  century,  OECD  countries
accounted for the lion’s share of global economic activity (Figure 2.5) and per capita GDP
levels  were much  higher than  in  the other  regions.  More  recently, per  capita  GDP  has
increased rapidly in the BRIICS region, with an average growth rate of 5.4% between 1990
and 2008; more than three times the rate of the OECD region. The fast growth in the BRIICS
has gradually shifted the relative regional weights in the global economy. By 2050, the
share of global economic activity attributable to the BRIICS is projected to rise to more than
40% (Figure 2.6). By 2050, the OECD’s share of the global economy is projected to decline
from 54% in 2010 to less than 32%.4 The US economy, which has been the largest in the
world as  measured  by  GDP  and  expressed  in  purchasing  power  parity  exchange  rates
(PPPs),  is  projected  to  be  overtaken  by  China  around 2012.  India’s  GDP  is  projected  to
surpass  that  of  the  United  States  before 2040.  In  nominal  terms,  however,  GDP  levels
remain highest in the United States (Chateau et al., 2011).

The 2008 financial crisis  led to a global economic recession in 2009 and  uncertain
prospects for the coming years. A modest recovery in OECD countries, combined with near
double-digit growth  in  some of  the  major emerging  economies – especially China and
India –  pulled  the  global  economy  back  to  a  growth  rate  of  just  below  5%  in 2010.
Box 2.2 highlights how economic shocks and environmental pressure are linked. However,
the Environmental Outlook Baseline projections do not account for future shocks like these;
they present the long-term trend rather than short-term forecasts. Short-term projections
for growth remain highly uncertain.

The world real GDP (measured in constant 2010 USD) is projected to grow on average
by about 3.5% per year from 2010 to 2050 (Table 2.1). This implies that world GDP would be
multiplied almost fourfold over the period. This is similar to the past (1970-2008) average
world GDP growth rate (expressed in 1990 USD), of close to 3.6% (Madison, 2010).

Box 2.2. The complex link between economic shocks 

and environmental pressure

The financial and economic crisis of 2008-2009 is an example of a shock to the economy
that cannot be anticipated in future projections. Scenario projections like the Environmental
Outlook  Baseline tend to focus on gradual, long-term trends. To some degree, short-term
deviations from long-term trends form part of the Baseline. However, it should still be noted
that the world economy is slowly, and unevenly, coming out of the worst crisis since World
War II, making economic projections for coming years even more uncertain than in the
past.

Lower output growth rates during the crisis and the potentially long recovery period may
have an impact on economic output levels over the long run. It may even result in long-
term growth rates that are lower than their pre-crisis levels. Long-term growth will be
influenced by a handful of factors, of which the most crucial are the growth of the labour
force and technical improvements. A slow process of industrial restructuring, caused for
example  by  credit constraints,  can hurt the  growth  of  total factor productivity  in  the
medium to long term, which in turn could also be curtailed by depressed investments in
private  research  and  development.  A  long  and  deep  recession  may  diminish  labour
demand  by  firms  due  to  the  reduction  in  economic  activity,  as  well  as  diminish  the
potential labour force by discouraging some of the unemployed from seeking jobs and by
reducing migration flows. Furthermore, long unemployment spells may cause permanent
damage to human capital (EU, 2009).

Environmental pressures are influenced by the economy and hence also by economic
shocks. For  example,  greenhouse  gas (GHG) emissions can be expected to be partially
related  to  GDP.  The  OECD  Environmental  Outlook  to 2030  (OECD, 2008b),  for  example,
modelled a high productivity scenario which showed that if global GDP was 16% higher
in 2030 this would imply 10% more GHG emissions.

54

2. SOCIO-ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS

Box 2.2. The complex link between economic shocks and environmental 

pressure (cont.)

It is not clear at this point whether the net impacts of the current crisis on the environment
will be positive or negative overall. It reduced the growth of GHG gas emissions in 2008-2009,
but this was followed in 2010 by the highest emission levels ever recorded (Chapter 3).
However, a prolonged period of stagnation or very low growth could once again lower emission
growth. In turn, this could delay improvements in resource efficiency and technology
development for a significant length of time, so the outcome might not necessarily be positive.
In any case, all current policy efforts are focused on re-kindling growth, so a return to growth
based on full recovery is the assumption for this Outlook. 

China and India have been important engines of global economic growth in recent
years, but their growth rates are projected to slow down in the coming decades as their
underlying  drivers  of  growth  (including  capital  supply  and  human  capital
improvements from better education) converge towards those of OECD countries (see
Annex 2.A and the section on growth drivers below). The expected slowdown is also due
to  underlying  demographic  changes  –  for  example,  ageing  is  a  prominent  factor  in
China.  While  the  projected  absolute  size  of  the  Chinese  economy  is  still  largest,  its
growth rate is projected to be surpassed by those of other Asian countries, such as India
and Indonesia (Table 2.1).

projected to grow at a much slower pace through to 2050, with most of them growing at
around 2% per year on average. 

In recent decades, per capita income levels have increased on average in almost all
regions of the world. This increase has not been evenly spread across the different regions,
with  per  capita  GDP  levels  increasing  twice  as  fast  in  the  BRIICS  (3.4%  annually
between 1970 and 2009) as in the other regions (1.9% in the OECD and 1.6% in the rest of the
world, respectively). By 2050, however, US per capita GDP is still projected to rank first,
almost double that of China. Household per capita consumption shows similar differences
across regions and countries (Table 2.2).

 What drives economic growth? 

Economic growth, or more precisely growth of GDP, is driven by i) increasing the value
added of production through the increased use of capital, labour and natural resources
(including land); ii) increasing the productivity of these primary production factors; and
iii) reallocating production factors to those activities that yield the highest value added. Labour
input  (employment)  is  in  turn  driven  by  demographic  developments,  which  combine
population, age structure, labour market participation and unemployment scenarios. 

The OECD Environmental Outlook Baseline projects  that between 2010 and 2030, GDP
growth  is  largely  driven  by  the  increased  use  of  physical  capital  (such  as  buildings,
machines and infrastructure), which boosts economic activity especially in the emerging
economies  (see Annex 2.A).5  As  physical capital and energy use  mostly  go  together in
production processes, this type of growth implies substantial increases in energy demand
in the near future (see the section on energy below).

56

OECD ENVIRONMENTAL OUTLOOK TO 2050 © OECD 2012

2. SOCIO-ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS

In  the  longer  run,  the  Outlook  projections  foresee a  slow  transition  towards  more
balanced  growth  in  all  major  economies,  with  growth  partially  converging  across
economies  and  physical  capital  accumulation  and  human  capital  contributing  more
equally to GDP growth. Countries that are further behind in terms of education (which
contributes to human capital) and physical capital levels are projected to experience higher
growth  rates  during the  catch-up  phase, as  explained  in Box 2.3.  Such  projections  are
uncertain and depend on several assumptions, especially about the institutional capacity
for development. The catch-up effect results in a growing contribution by human capital to
long-term GDP growth, partly limiting increases in environmental pressure (decoupling
environment  from  economic  growth).  However,  to  achieve  these  increases  in  human
capital development, it will be essential that education and training policies build workers’
knowledge and skills. 

Box 2.3. The conditional convergence methodology: 

Assumptions for model-based projections

Baseline economic scenarios underlying global environmental economic projections –
such as those developed for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 2007)
– typically assume that globally, income levels will gradually converge towards those of
most developed economies. This Outlook takes a similar approach, though placing special
emphasis on the drivers of GDP growth over the projection period rather than projecting
convergence only on income levels (Duval and de la Maisonneuve, 2010). Based on this,
long-term projections are made for five main drivers of per capita economic growth: i) total
factor productivity;  ii) human  capital  (which drives labour  productivity);  iii) capital-to-
output ratios;  iv) population, age structure, participation and unemployment scenarios
(which together drive employment levels); and v) natural resource availability. Gradual
convergence of regions towards the best performing countries is projected within 50 to
100 years, depending on the driver. Together with population growth, these drivers are
then used to project the future path of GDP.

While the labour force is ultimately constrained by population, differences between
growth rates in population and employment can nevertheless persist over many years,
reflecting changes in demographics, labour force participation trends and unemployment
projections.  The  average  annual  growth  rate  of  population  is  compared  to  that  of
employment in Figure 2.7. Continued ageing of the population is projected in many OECD
countries, and also in China and some other emerging economies. This is related to lower
labour  participation  rates.  However,  the  much  younger  population  profiles  in  many
developing countries, especially in Africa and Asia, imply that the share of working-age
people will increase over time, thereby boosting labour supply. This also holds for India,
although this trend is combined with an increased share of elderly people.

International  trade  also  affects  economic  growth,  and  is  projected  to  continue  to
outpace GDP growth. But the existing current account imbalances seem untenable over the
long run as they put pressure on exchange rates. Therefore, this Outlook projects a gradual
reduction of current account balances over time. For most regions, the current account is
projected to balance by 2050, but larger imbalances for China and the United States will
require longer to fully fade.

 How will the structure of the economy change?

The  sectoral  composition  of  the  different  regions  has  shifted  over  time,  with  the
service sector contributing a growing share (Figure 2.8). This increasing share of services in
value terms results from an increase in their production cost relative to other goods, but
also reflects a structural shift towards a more services-oriented economy. This structural
change is in part driven by the evolution of household consumption patterns. Demand for
services, including health care services, increases as the average person gets older and
wealthier. It is also to some extent driven by growing use of research and development
(R&D) and services in industrial production. There have obviously been significant shifts
within these large sectoral groupings. The types of services provided nowadays are quite
distinct from those 40 years ago, for instance through the emergence of information and
communications as a sector.

The Outlook Baseline projects that this structural shift towards a more services-oriented
economy will level off in OECD countries by 2050. As indicated in Figure 2.9, sector shares in
real terms (i.e. relative price effects are excluded) are more or less stable over time. According
to the assumption of economic convergence, the service sectors in developing countries are
projected to contribute a growing share to the global economy, while the share of the
agricultural sector diminishes. These trends fit with the global shift towards more labour-
driven economic growth. The declining share of agriculture does not imply that absolute levels

of food production will decrease, but merely that it grows less quickly than other sectors in the
economy. To feed a growing population, global food production needs to continue to grow,
thereby leading to increases in demand for agricultural land (see below).

3. The links between economic activity and environmental pressures

How  do  the  trends  outlined  above  link  to  the  environment?  This  final  section

discusses trends in two drivers of environmental change – energy use and land use.

Energy use

Energy use is essentially driven by economic activity and technological developments,
including energy efficiency  improvements.  Energy  consumption  patterns differ  widely
across the world. In OECD countries the average person consumes 3 tons of oil equivalent
of energy (toe) a year, while in low-income regions, such as most of Africa and parts of Asia
and  Latin  America,  the  figure  is  well  below  1 toe  (IEA, 2011).  In 2009,  about  1.4 billion
people in low-income regions still had no access to electricity, and nearly 2.7 billion people
mainly relied on traditional biomass (IEA, 2010). 

As GDP  is projected to  almost quadruple by 2050,  total  commercial  energy use  is
also projected to grow strongly over the next four decades, reaching about 900 Exajoule
(EJ)6 in 2050 – around an 80% increase over global energy consumption in 2010 (Box 2.4).7
Continuous improvements in energy efficiency will reduce overall energy intensity (i.e. the
ratio between energy use and GDP) to about 40% lower than current levels in 2050. Climate
change (especially CO2 emissions) and health impacts from local air pollution (Chapters 3
and 6) are strongly linked to trends in energy use and production. Figure 2.10 shows how
the Baseline projection on total primary energy use relates to historical trends and the
range found in the literature, as reviewed in van Vuuren et al. (2011).

Notes:  A widely accepted method for the accounting of primary energy use from different energy sources does not
exist. Here, the methodology proposed by the IEA is used, which assumes a 33% efficiency for nuclear power and
100% for renewable power. Alternative methods may lead to slightly different contributions of nuclear power and
renewables to the energy mix. The shaded area indicates the 10-90th percentile literature range.

Figure 2.11 shows how the Outlook Baseline projects the different energy sources to
change regionally by 2050. Despite the fact that most energy is currently consumed in
industrialised  countries,  emerging  and  developing  countries  play  a  dominant  role  in
energy  production  worldwide.  In 2008,  China  supplied  more  than  40%  of  global  coal

production  and  the  Middle  East  and  Russia  together  accounted  for  almost  40%  of  oil
production and about 35% of natural gas production (IEA, 2011). Consumption growth in
the Baseline projection is mainly driven by increasing demand in the BRIICS and some
other developing countries. Oil production in Europe, and to a lesser extent in North
America,8 decreases in the Baseline because of the progressive depletion of oil reserves.

The increase in energy consumption in the Baseline scenario is consistent with similar
projections by the International Energy Agency (IEA).9  Assuming no change in current
policies, fossil fuels retain a large market share in the Baseline,  as their average prices
remain lower than those of alternative fuels in most countries. Annual average growth
rates of consumption are projected to be in the order of 0.5% for oil and 1.8% for coal and
natural gas. For oil and natural gas, depletion and resulting price increases around the
middle  of  the  21st  century  are  projected  to  lead  to  stabilisation  or  even  a  peak  in
production, which is concentrated in only a few resource-rich regions. For coal, however,
resource scarcity is not projected to limit production, or even lead to price increases, in the
foreseeable future. With strong economic growth in coal-rich regions, it is likely that the
share of coal in the energy mix will further increase. At the same time, non-fossil energy
production, including nuclear, commercial biomass and other renewables, will increase
steadily.10

2. SOCIO-ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS

Box 2.4. Uncertainties in energy projections

There  are some  key uncertainties  surrounding  energy projections  embedded  in the

Environmental Outlook Baseline scenario:

i)

The development of the energy intensity of the global economy has historically varied
between 1%-2%. The assumptions made about this factor will have a major impact on
projections  of  future  emissions.  The  Outlook  Baseline  projects  an  average  annual
reduction in energy intensity of 1.3%, which is similar to IEA projections (IEA, 2010). 

ii) A  major  driver  of  the  energy  mix  is  the  relative  price  of  different  fuels.  Given  the
complex nature of international fuel markets, and the large uncertainties surrounding
resources, technology development and fuel prices in the future, this poses a major
source of uncertainty in the Baseline projection of this Outlook. 

Two sets of models were used for the Environmental Outlook (see Chapter 1 for more on
the approach and methodology). Both models – ENV-Linkages and IMAGE – project that the
overall share of fossil fuels in the energy  mix to 2050 remains rather stable, as do the
shares  of  nuclear  and renewable  energy. A key  difference  between  the two  models  is
whether coal or natural gas will be the main source of increased energy supply in the
future. Based on IEA (2010) projections, the ENV-Linkages model projects the price of gas to
increase more rapidly than that of oil and coal, thereby creating a relatively favourable
environment for the build-up of coal-fired power plants in countries such as China and
India. On the other hand, natural gas shows a more rapid growth rate in the next decades
in IMAGE projections than in ENV-linkages projections. This is because in IMAGE, energy
prices emerge from the relative availability of reserves of the different fossil fuels.

Land use

Agricultural production has increased strongly over recent decades to meet rising food
demand  driven  by  both  population  growth  and  changes  in  diets.  About  80%  of  the
production increase has been achieved through higher yields from existing land, and about
20% through expanding agricultural land (Bruinsma, 2003). Between 1970 and 2010, the
share of agricultural land use (crop and grazing land), expanded by about 4 percentage
points,  largely  at  the  expense  of  forest  area  (Figure 2.12).  A  somewhat  lower  pace  of
expansion has been observed over the last decade.

The  OECD  Environmental  Outlook  Baseline  projects  that  competition  between
agricultural  land  use  and  other  land  uses  will  intensify  in  the  coming  decade  under
current policies (Box 2.5). This is also the conclusion of the OECD/FAO Agricultural Outlook
to 2020 (OECD/FAO, 2011). A converging GDP per capita and a growing population will both
increase  the  demand  for  food,  especially  animal  products.  Moreover,  policies  that
stimulate the use of biofuels also increase the demand for agricultural production and land
area  (Chapter 4).  Given  the  limited  supply  of  land,  this  means  that  in  the  short  run
deforestation will continue, although at slower rates than in past decades. 

The population projections discussed above suggest that the global population will
level off and largely stabilise around 2050. While changes in diets are expected to remain
a  factor  in  an  increasing  demand  for  agricultural  production,  these  increases  are
projected  to  be  less  than  the  historical  rates,  in  line  with  the  convergence  in  income
levels  and,  to  some  extent,  consumer preferences.  Based  on  these  trends,  the
Environmental  Outlook  Baseline  scenario  projects  global  agricultural  area  to  continue  to

increase to about 2030, after which it will stabilise then decline back to around today’s
levels by 2050. Yield improvements are assumed to be slower in the future than in past
decades,  but are still  projected to  eventually lower demand  for agricultural land, even
under current policies (Figure 2.13).11

2. SOCIO-ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS

Historical and projected trends in agricultural land use differ tremendously across
regions.  The  area  devoted  to  agriculture  in  OECD  countries  has  decreased  slightly
since 1970, while there has been rapid expansion in other parts of the world (for instance,
in Brazil, China and Indonesia, by 35%, 40% and 26% respectively). In OECD countries, a
further slight decrease of 2% towards 2050 is projected (Figure 2.14). For the BRIICS as a
whole, the Baseline projects a decrease of more than 17% to 2050, largely reflecting the
declining  population  in  China  and  Russia.  A  further  expansion  in  agricultural  area  is
projected for the rest of the world, at least in the coming decades, where population is still
growing and the transition towards a higher calorie and more meat-based diet is likely to
continue. In this region, forest areas are declining, especially where there is significant
agricultural expansion. In other regions, including China, reduced demand for agricultural
land is projected to lead to increases in forest area, not least to meet increased global
demand for wood and other forest products. 

Box 2.5. Uncertainties in land-use projections

As mentioned above, land-use projections are highly sensitive to the projections for
climate change, population, dietary change and agricultural yield increases, and to a lesser
extent urbanisation.* Yield increases have played a major role in historical land-use trends.
The increase in yields in the Baseline projection is in line with FAO projections published in
Agriculture  Towards 2030/2050 (Bruinsma,  2003). In  contrast, the  same  assumptions  on
demand growth but with lower yield increases would lead to a continued expansion in
land area to 2050. Both scenarios can be found in the literature: i) where agricultural area
continues to grow (although more slowly); and ii) where it peaks in the next few decades,
especially grazing land. Whether and when this peak might occur depends, among other
things,  on  the  extent  to  which  yield  increases  continue  to  be  driven  by  efficiency
improvements (induced by technological progress), current policies, or by land scarcity. In
comparison to the range found in the literature, the land-use projections for this Outlook
show a rather intense competition among land uses in the short to medium term (to 2020),
but a reversal of the trend in the following decades that is more optimistic than most other
studies. Still, the resulting levels of land use for 2050 are well within the range found in the
literature (cf. Figure 2.13).
* While the direct effect of urbanisation on land competition is limited, it should be noted that urbanisation
often  comes  at  the  expense  of  highly  productive  agricultural  land,  thus  stimulating  further  land  use
changes.

These  agricultural  developments  are  the  main  drivers  of  land-use  change,  and
consequently developments in land-use related GHG emissions, changes in water stress
and biodiversity pressures, as discussed in subsequent chapters.

Notes
1. More details on the construction of the Baseline projection are given in Chateau et al. (2011).

2. This  Environmental  Outlook  uses  the  UN’s 2008  revision  of  medium-term  population  projections
(UN, 2009), in which world population is projected to increase to 9.15 billion in 2050. The UN has
since published revised projections for 2050 (UN, 2011) which are somewhat higher (9.3 billion),
mainly due to greater projected population increase in Africa.

3. While  GDP  is  an  adequate  measure  of  economic  activity,  it  is  not  a  good  indicator  of  welfare

(Stiglitz et al., 2009).

4. Estimates of regional shares in global GDP depend crucially on the use of exchange rates. Here GDP
aggregates  are  valued  using  constant 2010  purchasing  power  parity  (PPP)  exchange  rates  as
presented in IMF (2010). As in recent years the US dollar has depreciated against most currencies,
using older exchange rates would imply higher shares of both the US and the OECD aggregate. See
Chateau et al. (2011) for a further discussion.

5. Although short-term cycles in economic activity are not considered in the projections presented in
Figure  2.6,  developments for 2010-2015 are  based  on  short-term  projections by IMF  (2010),  the
World Bank (2010) and the OECD. 

6. 1 Exajoule equals 1 billion Gigajoule, which is roughly equivalent to 23.9 million toe.

7. There is no widely accepted method for accounting for primary energy use from different energy
sources. This graph uses the methodology proposed by the IEA, which assumes a 33% efficiency for
nuclear power and 100% for renewable power. Alternative methods may lead to slightly different
contributions of nuclear power and renewables to the energy mix.

8. The  decrease  in  North  America  occurs  in  the  United  States  and  Mexico.  In  contrast,  Canada  is

projected to increase oil production, especially from non-conventional sources such as shale oil.

9. Energy consumption patterns have been calibrated to match those of the IEA projections.

10. The projection for nuclear expansion was made before the earthquake and tsunami occurred in
Japan in 2011. This emphasises that it is important to see these projections as long-term trends
that do not incorporate the effects of unanticipated shocks.

11. For example, for temperate cereals the average annual yield growth rate in the Baseline projection
is  1.0%,  where  it  has  historically  been  1.5%  (1970-2010;  FAOStat  data).  Similarly,  for  rice  the
projection is +0.9% (historically +1.6%) and for maize 0.8% (historically +1.7%).

This chapter analyses the policy implications of the climate change challenge. Are
current  emission  reduction  pledges  made  in  Copenhagen/Cancun  enough  to
stabilise the climate and limit global average temperature increase to 2 oC? If not,
what will the consequences be? What alternative growth pathways could stabilise
the  global  average  atmospheric  concentration  of  greenhouse  gases  (GHG)  at
450 ppm, the level which has a 50% chance of keeping the temperature rise to 2 oC?
What policies are needed, and what will be the costs and benefits to the economy?
How can the world adapt to the warming that is already occurring? To shed light on
these questions, this chapter first looks at trends to 2050 in GHG concentration and
emissions  (including  from  land  use),  temperature  and  precipitation  under  the
Environmental Outlook Baseline scenario of “business-as-usual” (i.e. no new
action). It then takes stock of the state of climate policy today. Most countries use a
mix of policy instruments, including carbon pricing (carbon taxes, cap-and-trade
emissions  trading,  fossil  fuel  subsidy  reform),  other  energy  efficiency  policies,
information-based approaches and innovation policies to foster clean technology.
The chapter then looks at what further action is needed by comparing different
mitigation  scenarios  against  the  Baseline.  These  include  various  scenarios  to
stabilise GHG concentrations at 450 ppm and 550 ppm using different technology
options, e.g. carbon capture and storage, phasing out nuclear power, and increasing
the use of biofuels; linking carbon markets; and various emissions permit allocation
rules. The chapter concludes by outlining how limiting global warming will require
transformative  policies  to  reconcile  short-term  action  with  long-term  climate
objectives, balancing their costs and benefits. Timely adaptation policies to limit
damage by the already changing climate will also be essential.

KEY MESSAGES

Climate change presents a global systemic risk to society. It threatens the basic elements of life for all

people: access to water, food production, health, use of land, and physical and natural capital. Inadequate
attention to climate change could have significant social consequences for human well-being, hamper
economic growth and heighten the risk of abrupt and large-scale changes to our climatic and ecological
systems. The significant economic damage could equate to a permanent loss in average per-capita world
consumption of more than 14% (Stern, 2006). Some poor countries would be likely to suffer particularly
severely. This chapter demonstrates how avoiding these economic, social and environmental costs will require
effective policies to shift economies onto low-carbon and climate-resilient growth paths.

Trends and projections
Environmental state and pressures 

Global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions continue to increase, and in 2010 global energy-related carbon
dioxide (CO2) emissions reached an all-time high of 30.6 gigatonnes (Gt) despite the recent economic
crisis. The Environmental Outlook Baseline scenario envisages that without more ambitious policies than
those in force today, GHG emissions will increase by more than 50% by 2050, primarily driven by a projected
70% growth in CO2 emissions from energy use. This is mainly due to a projected 80% increase in global
energy demand. Transport emissions are projected to double, due to a strong increase in demand for cars
in developing countries. Historically, OECD economies have been responsible for most of the emissions. In
the coming decades, increasing emissions will also be caused by high economic growth in some of the
major emerging economies.

Without more ambitious policies, the Baseline projects that atmospheric concentrations of GHG would
reach almost 685 parts per million (ppm) CO2-equivalents by 2050. This is well above the concentration
level of 450 ppm required to have at least a 50% chance of stabilising the climate at a 2-degree Celsius (2 oC)
global average temperature increase, the goal set at the 2010 United Nations Framework Convention on
Climate  Change  (UNFCCC)  Conference  in  Cancún.  Under  the  Baseline  projection,  global  average

temperature is likely to exceed this goal by 2050, and to be 3 oC to 6 oC higher than pre-industrial levels by
the end of the century. Such a high temperature increase would continue to alter precipitation patterns,
melt glaciers, cause sea-level rise and intensify extreme weather events to unprecedented levels. It might
also exceed some critical “tipping-points”, causing dramatic natural changes that could have catastrophic
or irreversible outcomes for natural systems and society.

Technological progress and structural shifts in the composition of growth are projected to improve the
energy intensity of economies in the coming decades (i.e. achieving a relative decoupling of GHG
emissions growth and GDP growth), especially in the OECD and the emerging economies of Brazil, Russia,
India, Indonesia, China and South Africa (BRIICS). However, under current trends, these regional
improvements would be outstripped by the increased energy demand worldwide.
Emissions from land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) are projected to decrease in the course
of the next 30 years, while carbon sequestration by forests increases. By 2045, net-CO2 emissions from land
use are projected to become negative in OECD countries. Most emerging economies also show a decreasing
trend in emissions from an expected slowing of deforestation. In the rest of the world (RoW), land-use
emissions are projected to increase to 2050, driven by expanding agricultural areas, particularly in Africa.

Policy responses

Pledging action to achieve national GHG emission reduction targets and actions under the UNFCCC at
Copenhagen and Cancún was an important first step by countries in finding a global solution. However, the
mitigation actions pledged by countries are not enough to be on a least-cost pathway to meet the 2 oC goal.
Limiting temperature increase to 2 oC from these pledges would require substantial additional costs
after 2020 to ensure that atmospheric concentrations of GHGs do not exceed 450 ppm over the long term.
More ambitious action is therefore needed now and post-2020. For example, 80% of the projected
emissions from the power sector in 2020 are inevitable, as they come from power plants that are already in
place or are being built today. The world is locking itself into carbon-intensive systems more strongly every
year. Prematurely closing plants or retrofitting with carbon capture and storage (CCS) – at significant
economic cost – would be the only way to reverse this “lock-in”.
Progress has been made in developing national strategies for adapting to climate change. These also
encourage the assessment and management of climate risk in relevant sectors. However, there is still a
long way to go before the right instruments and institutions are in place to explicitly incorporate climate
change risk into policies and projects, increase private-sector engagement in adaptation actions and
integrate climate change adaptation into development co-operation. 

Policy steps to build a low-carbon, climate-resilient economy

We must act now to reverse emission trends in order to stabilise GHG concentrations at 450 ppm CO2e and
increase the chance of limiting the global average temperature rise to 2 oC. Ambitious mitigation action
substantially lowers the risk of catastrophic climate change. The cost of reaching the 2 oC goal would slow
global GDP growth from 3.5 to 3.3% per year (or by 0.2 percentage-points) on average, costing roughly 5.5% of
global GDP in 2050. This cost should be compared with the potential cost of inaction, which could be as high as
14% of average world consumption per capita according to some estimates (Stern, 2006). 

Delaying action is costly. Delayed or only moderate action up to 2020 (such as implementing the
Copenhagen/Cancún pledges only, or waiting for better technologies to come on stream) would increase the
pace and scale of efforts needed after 2020. It would lead to 50% higher costs in 2050 compared to timely action,
and potentially entail higher environmental risk. 

A prudent response to climate change calls for both an ambitious mitigation policy to reduce further
climate change, and timely adaptation policies to limit damage from the impacts that are already inevitable. In

the context of tight government budgets, finding least-cost solutions and engaging the private sector will be
critical to finance the transition. Costly overlaps between policies must also be avoided. The following actions
are a priority:
■ Adapt to inevitable climate change. The level of GHG already in the atmosphere means that some changes
in the climate are now inevitable. The impact on people and ecosystems will depend on how the world
adapts to those changes. Adaptation policies will need to be implemented to safeguard the well-being of
current and future generations worldwide. 
Integrate adaptation into development co-operation. The management of climate change risks is closely
intertwined with economic development – impacts will be felt more by the poorest and most vulnerable
populations. National governments and donor agencies have a key role to play and integrating climate
change adaptation strategies into all development planning is now critical. This will involve assessing
climate risks and opportunities within national government processes, at sectoral and project levels, and in
both urban and rural contexts. The uncertainty surrounding climate impacts means that flexibility is
important. 

■ Set  clear,  credible,  more  stringent  and  economy-wide  GHG-mitigation  targets  to  guide  policy  and
investment decisions. Participation of all major emission sources, sectors and countries would reduce the
costs of mitigation and help to address potential leakage and competitiveness concerns.

■ Put a price on carbon. This Outlook models a 450 ppm Core scenario which suggests that achieving the 2 oC
goal would require establishing clear carbon prices that are increased over time. This could be done using
market-based instruments like carbon taxes or emission trading schemes. These can provide a dynamic
incentive for innovation, technological change and driving private finance towards low-carbon, climate-
resilient investments. These can also generate revenues to ease tight government budgets and potentially
provide new sources of public funds. For example, if the Copenhagen Accord pledges and actions for Annex I
countries were to be implemented as a carbon tax or a cap-and-trade scheme with fully auctioned permits,
in 2020 the fiscal revenues would amount to more than USD 250 billion, i.e  0.6% of their GDP. 

■ Reform fossil fuel support policies. Support to fossil fuel production and use in OECD countries is estimated
to have been about USD 45-75 billion a year in recent years; developing and emerging economies provided
USD 409 billion in 2010 (IEA data). OECD Outlook simulation shows that phasing out fossil fuels subsidies in
developing countries could reduce by 6% global energy-related GHG emissions, provide incentives for
increased energy efficiency and renewable energy and also increase public finance for climate action.
However, fossil fuel subsidy reforms should be implemented carefully while addressing potential negative
impacts on households through appropriate measures. 

■ Foster  innovation  and  support  new  clean  technologies.  The  cost  of  mitigation  could  be  significantly
reduced if R&D could come up with new breakthrough technologies. For example, emerging technologies –
such as bioenergy from waste biomass and CCS – have the potential to absorb carbon from the atmosphere.
Perfecting these technologies, and finding new ones, will require a clear price on carbon, targeted
government-funded R&D, and policies to reduce the financial risks. 

■ Complement carbon pricing with well-designed regulations. Carbon pricing and support for innovation
may not be enough to ensure all energy-efficiency options are adopted or accessible. Additional targeted
regulatory instruments (such as fuel, vehicle and building-efficiency standards) may also be required. If
designed to overcome market barriers and avoid costly overlap with market-based instruments, they can
accelerate the uptake of clean technologies, encourage innovation and reduce emissions cost-effectively.
The net contribution of the instrument “mix” to social welfare, environmental effectiveness and economic
efficiency should be regularly reviewed.

1. Introduction

Climate change is a serious global systemic risk that threatens life and the economy.
Observations of increases in global average temperatures, widespread melting of snow and
ice,  and a rising global  average sea level indicate that the climate is already warming
(IPCC, 2007a). If greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions continue to grow, this could result in a wide
range of adverse impacts and potentially trigger large-scale, irreversible and catastrophic
changes (IPCC, 2007b) that will exceed the adaptive capacity of natural and social systems.
The  environmental, social and  economic costs  of  inaction are  likely  to  be significant.
Agreements  reached  in  Cancún,  Mexico,  at  the 2010  United  Nations  Climate  Change
Conference recognised the need for deep cuts in global GHG emissions in order to limit the
global average temperature increase to 2 degrees Celsius (2 oC) above pre-industrial levels
(UNFCCC, 2011a). A temperature increase of more than 2 oC is likely to push components of
the Earth’s climate system past critical thresholds, or “tipping points” (EEA, 2010).

This chapter seeks to analyse the policy implications of the climate change challenge.
Are current emission reduction pledges enough to stabilise climate change and limit global
average  temperature  increase  to  2 oC?  If  not,  what  will  the  consequences  be?  What
alternative growth pathways could achieve this goal? What policies are needed, and what
will be the costs and benefits to the economy? And last, but not least, how can the world
adapt to the changes that are already occurring?

To shed light on these questions, this chapter first looks at the “business-as-usual”
situation, using projections from the Environmental Outlook Baseline scenario, to see what
the climate would be like in 2050 if no new action is taken.1 It then compares different
policy  scenarios against this “no-new-policy” Baseline scenario to  understand  how the
situation  could  be  improved.  Section 3  (“Climate  Change:  The  state  of  policy  today”)
describes how a prudent response to climate change involves a two-pronged approach:
ambitious  mitigation  policies2  to  reduce  further  climate  change,  as  well  as  timely
adaptation3  policies  to  limit  damage  by  climate  change  impacts  that  are  inevitable.
Mitigation  and  adaptation  policies  are  essential,  and  they  are  complementary.  Most
countries have begun to respond through actions at the international, national and local
levels, drawing on a mix of policy instruments that include carbon pricing, other energy-
efficiency policies, information-based approaches and innovation. Some progress can be
noted, but much more needs to be done to achieve the 2 oC goal.

The  chapter  concludes  by  outlining  how  limiting  global  warming  will  require
transformative policies to reconcile short-term action with long-term climate objectives,
balancing  their  costs  and  benefits.  The  transition  to  a  low-carbon,  climate-resilient
development path requires financing, innovation and strategies that also address potential
negative  competitiveness  and  employment  impacts.  Such  a  path  can  also  create  new
opportunities as part of a green growth strategy. Thus, the work presented here shows that
through appropriate policies and international co-operation, climate change can be tackled
in a way that will not cap countries’ aspirations for growth and prosperity.

2. Trends and projections 

Greenhouse gas emissions and concentrations
Historical and recent trends 

Several  gases  contribute  to  climate  change.  The  Kyoto  Protocol4  intends  to  limit
emissions of the six gases which are responsible for the bulk of global warming. Of these,
the three most potent are carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O),
currently  accounting  for  98%  of  the  GHG  emissions  covered  by  the  Kyoto  Protocol
(Figure 3.1).  The  other  gases,  hydrofluorocarbons  (HFCs),  perfluorocarbons  (PFCs)  and
sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) account for less than 2%, but their total emissions are growing.
These gases differ in terms of their warming effect and their longevity in the atmosphere.
Apart from these six GHGs, there are several other atmospheric substances that lead to
warming (e.g. chlorofluorocarbons or CFCs, and black carbon – see Box 3.14) or to cooling
(e.g. sulphate aerosols). Unless otherwise mentioned, in this chapter the term “emissions”
refers  to  the  Kyoto  gases  only,  while  the  climate  impacts  described  are  based  on  a
consideration of all the climate forcing gases (the term “climate forcer” is used for any gas
or particle that alters the Earth’s energy balance by absorbing or reflecting radiation).

Global GHG emissions have doubled since the early 1970s (Figure 3.1), driven mainly by
economic growth and increasing fossil-energy use in developing countries. Historically,
OECD countries emitted the bulk of GHG emissions, but the share of Brazil, Russia, India,
Indonesia, China and South Africa (the BRIICS countries)  in global GHG emissions has
increased to 40%, from 30% in the 1970s. 

Overall, the global average concentrations of various GHGs in the atmosphere have
been continuously increasing since records began. In 2008, the concentration of all GHGs
regulated in the Kyoto Protocol was 438 parts per million (ppm) CO2-equivalent (CO2e). This

was 58% higher than the pre-industrial level (EEA, 2010a). It is coming very close to the
450 ppm threshold, the level associated with a 50% chance of exceeding the 2 oC global
average temperature change goal (see Section 4).

Carbon dioxide emissions. Today CO2 emissions account for around 75% of global GHG
emissions. While global CO2 emissions decreased in 2009 – by 1.5% – due to the economic
slowdown, trends varied depending on the country context: developing countries (non-
Annex I, see Section 3.3) emissions continued to grow by 3%, led by China and India, while
emissions from developed countries fell sharply – by 6.5% (IEA, 2011a). Most CO2 emissions
come  from  energy  production,  with  fossil  fuel  combustion  representing  two-thirds  of
global  CO2  emissions.  Indications  of  trends  for 2010  suggest  that  energy-related  CO2
emissions will rebound to reach their highest ever level at 30.6 gigatonnes (GtCO2), a 5%
increase from the previous record year of 2008.5 A slow-down in OECD emissions has been
more  than  compensated  for  by  increased  emissions  in  non-OECD  countries,  mainly
China – the country with the largest energy-related GHG emissions since 2007 (IEA, 2011a). 
In 2009,  CO2  emissions  from  fossil  fuel  combustions  were  based  on  coal  (43%),
followed  by  oil  (37%)  and  gas  (20%).  Today’s  rapid  economic  growth,  especially  in  the
BRIICS, is largely dependent on increased use of carbon-intensive coal-fired power, driven
by the existence of large coal reserves with limited reserves of other energy sources. While
emission intensities in economic terms (defined as the ratio of energy use to GDP) vary
greatly around the world, CO2 emissions are growing at a slower rate than GDP in most
OECD and emerging economies (Figure 3.2). In other words, CO2 emissions are becoming
relatively “decoupled” from economic growth.

On a per-capita basis, OECD countries still emit far more CO2 than most other world
regions, with 10.6 tonnes of CO2 emitted per capita on average in OECD countries in 2008,
compared with 4.9 tonnes in China, and 1.2 tonnes in India (Figure 3.3). However, rapidly
expanding economies are significantly increasing their emissions per capita. China for
instance doubled its emissions per capita between 2000 and 2008. These calculations are
based on the usual definition that emissions are attributed to the place where they occur,
sometimes labelled the “production-based emissions accounting approach”. If one allocates
emissions according to their end-use, i.e. using a consumption-based approach, part of the
emission increases in the BRIICS regions would be attributed to the OECD countries, as these
emissions are “embedded” in exports from the BRIICS to the OECD (see Box 3.1).

Other gases. Methane  is  the  second  largest  contributor  to  human-induced  global
warming, and is 25 times more potent than CO2 over a 100-year period. Methane emissions
contribute to over one-third of today’s human-induced warming. As a short-lived climate
forcer, limiting methane emissions will be a critical strategy for reducing the near-term
rate  of  global  warming  and  avoiding  exceeding  climatic  tipping  points  (see below).
Methane  is  emitted  from  both  anthropogenic  and  natural  sources;  over  50%  of  global
methane emissions are from  human activities,6 such as fossil fuel production, animal
husbandry (enteric fermentation in livestock and manure management), rice cultivation,
biomass burning and waste management. Natural sources of methane include wetlands,
gas  hydrates,  permafrost, termites,  oceans,  freshwater  bodies,  non-wetland  soils,  and
other sources such as wildfires.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) lasts a long time in the atmosphere (approximately 120 years) and
has powerful heat trapping effects – about 310 times more powerful than CO2. It therefore
has a large global warming potential. Around 40% of N2O emissions are anthropogenic, and
come mainly  from  soil  management,  mobile and stationary  combustion  of fossil  fuel,

Box 3.1. Production versus demand-based emissions

Production-based accounting of CO2 emissions allocates emissions to the country where production
occurs – it does not account for emissions caused by final domestic demand. Alternatively, consumption-
based accounting differs from traditional, production-based inventories because of imports and exports
of goods and services that, either directly or indirectly, involve CO2 emissions. Emissions embedded in
imported goods are added to direct emissions from domestic production, while emissions related to
exported goods are deducted. A comparison between the two approaches shows that total emissions
generated to meet demand in OECD countries have increased faster than emissions from production in
these countries (Figure 3.4). 

However, international comparisons should be interpreted with caution as country differences are due
to a host of factors – including climate change mitigation efforts, trends in international specialisation,
and countries’ relative competitive advantages. While the fast growth of production-based emissions in
the BRIICS may partly reflect the worldwide shift of heavy industry and manufacturing to emerging
economies,  these  figures  should  not  be  confused  with  carbon  leakage*  effects  as  they are based on
observed trends in production, consumption and trade patterns.

CFCs and HCFCs are powerful GHGs that are purely man-made and used in a variety of
applications. As they also deplete the ozone layer, they have been progressively phased out
under the Montreal Protocol on Substances That Deplete the Ozone Layer. HFCs and PFCs are
being used as replacements for CFCs. While their contribution to global warming is still

relatively small, it is growing rapidly. They are produced from chemical processes involved in
the production of metals, refrigeration, foam blowing and semiconductor manufacturing.

Future emission projections 

This section presents the key findings of the Environmental Outlook Baseline scenario,
which looks forward to 2050 and is based on business as usual in terms of policies and on the
socio-economic projections described in Chapter 2 (see Annex 3.A for more detail on the
assumptions underlying the Baseline). Any projection of future emissions is subject to
fundamentally uncertain factors, such as demographic growth, productivity gains, fossil
fuels prices and energy efficiency gains. The scenario suggests that GHG emissions will
continue to grow to 2050. Despite sizeable energy-efficiency gains, energy and industry-
related  emissions are projected to more than  double to 2050 compared  to 1990 levels.
Meanwhile, net emissions from land-use change are projected to decrease rapidly (Box 3.2).
Emissions  from  BRIICS  countries  are  projected  to  account  for  most  of  the  increase
(Figure 3.5). This is driven by growth in population and GDP per capita, leading to growing
per-capita GHG emissions. In the OECD, emissions are projected to grow at a slower pace,
partly reflecting demographic decline and slower economic growth, as well as existing
climate policies. Overall, the contribution of OECD countries to global GHG emissions is
projected to drop to 23%, but OECD countries will continue to have the highest emissions per
capita (Figure 3.6).

Transport emissions are projected to double between 2010 and 2050, due in part to a strong
increase in demand for cars in developing countries, and growth in aviation (Figure 3.7).
However, CO2 emissions from land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF), driven in
the last 20 years by the rapid conversion of forests to grassland and cropland in tropical
regions, are expected to decline over time and even become a net sink of emissions in
the 2040-2050 timeframe in OECD countries (Figure 3.5 and 3.8 and Box 3.2).

3. CLIMATE CHANGE

Box 3.2. Land-use emissions of CO2 – past trends and future projections
Historically,  global  net-CO2  emissions  from  land-use  change  (mainly  deforestation
driven by the expansion of agricultural land) have been in the order of 4-8 GtCO2 a year.
Other factors also contribute to land-use related emissions, e.g. forest degradation and
urbanisation.

In  the  Baseline  scenario,  the  global  agricultural  land  area  is  projected  to  expand
until 2030,  and  to  decline  thereafter,  due  to  a  number  of  underlying  factors  such  as
demographics and agricultural yield improvements (see Chapter 2 for detailed discussions).
However, the projected trends in agricultural land area differ tremendously across regions.
In OECD countries, a slight decrease (2%) to 2050 is projected. For the BRIICS as a whole, the
projected decrease is more than 17%, reflecting in particular the declining population in
Russia and China (from 2035). At least for the coming decades, a  further  expansion  in
agricultural  area  is  still  projected  in  the  rest  of  the  world,  where  population  is  still
growing and the transition towards a higher calorie and more meat-based diet is likely
to continue. These agricultural developments are among the main drivers of land-use
change,  and  consequently  of  developments  in  GHG  emissions  from  land  use
(Figure 3.8). From about 2045 onwards, a net reforestation trend is projected – with CO2
emissions from land use becoming negative.

However, there is large uncertainty over these projections, because of annual variations
and data limitations on land-use trends and the exact size of various carbon stocks.* To
date, the key driver of agricultural production has been yield increases (80%), while only
20% of the increase has come from an expansion in agricultural area (Smith et al., 2011). If
agricultural yield improvements turn out to be less than anticipated, global agricultural
land area might not decline, but could stabilise or grow slowly instead.

* Land-use related emissions can be more volatile than energy emissions. For instance, emissions are not only
influenced by land-use changes but also by land management. Furthermore, there is considerably more
uncertainty in methodologies for evaluating land-use related emissions, as these are less well-established.

Other gases. Methane  and  nitrous  oxide  emissions are  projected  to  increase  to 2050.
Although  agricultural  land  is  expected  to  expand  only  slowly,  the  intensification  of
agricultural practices (especially  the use of fertilisers)  in developing countries and the
change of dietary patterns (increasing consumption of meat) are projected to drive up these
emissions. At the same time, emissions of HFCs and PFCs, driven by increasing demand for
coolants and use in semiconductor manufacturing, will continue growing rapidly.

Impacts of climate change
Temperature and precipitation

Global warming is underway. The global mean temperature has risen about 0.7 oC to
0.8 oC on average above pre-industrial levels. These observed changes in climate have already
had an influence on human and natural systems (IPCC, 2007b). The greatest warming over the
past century occurred at high latitudes, with a large portion of the Arctic having experienced
warming of more than 2 oC.

The projected large increase in global GHG emissions in the Baseline is expected to have a
significant  impact  on  the  global  mean  temperature  and  the  global  climate.  The
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s Fourth Assessment Report (IPCC, 2007a)
concluded that a doubling of CO2 concentrations from pre-industrial levels (when they were
approximately 280 ppm) would likely lead to an increase of temperature somewhere between
2.0 oC and 4.5 oC7 (the so-called climate sensitivity8). Climate sensitivity values above 5 oC,
such as 8 oC or more, cannot be ruled out, which would shift the estimated temperature
increases for existing emission levels even higher (Meinshausen et al.  2006; Weitzman, 2009). 

Under the Outlook Baseline scenario, the global concentration of GHGs is expected to reach
approximately 685 ppm CO2-equivalent (CO2e) by mid-century and more than 1 000 ppm CO2e
by 2100. The concentration of CO2 alone is projected to be around 530 ppm in 2050 and
780 ppm in 2100 (Figure 3.9). As a result, global mean temperature is expected to increase,

though there is still uncertainty surrounding the climate sensitivity. The Outlook Baseline
scenario suggests that these GHG-concentration levels would lead to an increase in global
mean temperature at the middle of the century of 2.0 oC-2.8 oC, and 3.7 oC-5.6 oC at the end of
the century (compared to pre-industrial times). These estimates are roughly in the middle
ranges of temperature changes found in the peer-reviewed literature (IPCC, 2007b).

Regions will be affected differently by these changes, and climate change patterns
across regions are even more uncertain than the changes in the mean values. Figures 3.10

Baseline scenario and for the 450 ppm scenarios modeled as part of this Outlook, which
would  limit  global  average  temperature  increase  to  2 oC  above  pre-industrial  levels

areas will be larger than at low latitudes. For precipitation, while changes differ strongly
across models, they all show that some areas will experience an increase in precipitation,
while others will experience a decrease.

Natural and economic impacts of climate change

In its Fourth Assessment Report, the IPCC concludes that global climate change has
already had observable and wide-ranging effects on the environment in the last 30 years
(Figure 3.12). Given the expected increase in temperature, the IPCC expects more impacts
in the future.

The impacts will not be spread equally between regions. Some of the regional impacts

forecast by the IPCC include:
■ North  America:  Decreasing  snowpack  in  the  western  mountains;  5%-20%  increase  in
yields  of  rain-fed  agriculture  in  some  regions;  increased  frequency,  intensity  and
duration of heat waves in cities that already experience them. 

■ Latin America: Gradual replacement of tropical forest by savannah in eastern Amazonia;
risk of significant biodiversity loss through species extinction in many tropical areas;

significant changes in water availability for human consumption, agriculture and energy
generation. 

■ Europe:  Increased  risk  of  inland  flash  floods;  more  frequent  coastal  flooding  and
increased erosion from storms and sea-level rise; glacial retreat in mountainous areas;
reduced snow cover and winter tourism; extensive species losses; reductions of crop
productivity in southern Europe. 

■ Africa:  By 2020,  between  75 and  250 million  people  are  projected  to  be  exposed  to
increased water stress; yields from rain-fed agriculture could be reduced by up to 50% in
some regions by 2020; agricultural production, including access to food, may be severely
compromised. 

■ Asia: Freshwater availability projected to decrease in Central, South, East and Southeast
Asia by the 2050s; coastal areas will be at risk due to increased flooding; the death rate
from diseases associated with floods and droughts is expected to rise in some regions.

Overall,  all  regions  are  expected  to  suffer  significant  net  damage  from  unabated
climate  change,  but  the  most  significant  impacts  are  likely  to  be  felt  in  developing
countries because of already challenging climatic conditions, the sectoral composition of
their  economy  and  their  more  limited  adaptive  capacities.  The  costs  of  damages  are
expected to be much more important in Africa and Southeast Asia than in OECD or Eastern
European  countries  (see Nordhaus  and  Boyer, 2000;  Mendelsohn et al.,  2006 and
OECD, 2009a for a compilation of results). Coastal areas would be particularly exposed as
well (Box 3.3). 

Recent research suggests that the impacts of unabated climate change may be more
dramatic than estimated by the IPCC. For example, the extent of sea-level rise could be
greater  (Oppenheimer et al.,  2007;  Rahmstorf, 2007).  Accelerated  loss  of  mass  in  the
Greenland  ice  sheet,  mountain  glaciers  and  ice  caps  could,  according  to  the  Arctic
Monitoring Assessment Programme (AMAP, 2009), lead to an increase of global sea levels in
2100 of 0.9m-1.6 m. In addition, researchers investigating climate feedbacks in more detail
have found that rising Arctic temperatures could lead to extra methane emissions from
melting permafrost (Shaefer et al., 2011). They also conclude that the climate sensitivity
could be higher than anticipated, meaning that a given temperature change could result
from lower global emissions than those suggested in the Fourth IPCC Assessment Report. 

Climate change might also lead to so-called “tipping-points”, i.e dramatic changes in
the system that could have catastrophic and irreversible outcomes for natural systems and
society. A variety of tipping points have been identified (EEA, 2010), such as a 1 oC-2 oC and
3 oC-5 oC temperature increase which would respectively result in the melting of the West
Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) and the Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS). The potential decrease of
Atlantic overturning circulation9 could have unknown but potentially dangerous effects on
the climate. Other examples of potential non-linear irreversible changes include increases
in  ocean  acidity  which  would  affect  marine  biodiversity  and  fish  stocks,  accelerated
methane emissions from permafrost melting, and rapid climate-driven transitions from
one  ecosystem  to  another.  The  level  of  scientific  understanding  –  as  well  as  the
understanding of possible impacts of most of these events – is low, and their economic
implications are therefore difficult to estimate. Some transitions are expected to occur over
shorter timeframes than others – the shorter the timeframe, the less opportunity to adapt
(EEA, 2010).

Box 3.3. Example of assets exposed to climate change: Coastal cities

Coastal zones are particularly exposed to climate change impacts, especially low-lying urban coastal
areas and atolls. Coastal cities are especially vulnerable to rising sea levels and storm surges. For example,
by 2070, in the absence of adaptation policies such as land-use planning or coastal defence systems, the
total population exposed to a 50cm sea-level rise could grow more than threefold to around 150 million
people.  This  would  be  due  to  the  combined  effects  of  climate  change  (sea-level  rise  and  increased
storminess), land subsidence, population growth and urbanisation. The total asset exposure could grow
even  more  dramatically,  reaching  USD 35 000 billion  by  the 2070s,  more  than  10 times  current  levels
(Figure 3.13).

Climate change impacts are closely linked to other environmental issues. For example,
the Environmental Outlook Baseline scenario projects negative impacts of climate change on
biodiversity and water resources. Without new policies, climate change would become the
greatest  driver  of  future  biodiversity  loss  (see Chapter 4 on  biodiversity).  The  cost  of
biodiversity  loss  is  particularly  high  in  developing  countries,  where  ecosystems  and
natural resources account for a significant share of income. Climate change can also affect
human health; either directly through heat stress or indirectly through its effects on water
and food quality and on the geographical and seasonal ranges of vector-borne diseases
(see Chapter 6). Climate change will also have an impact on the availability of freshwater
(see Chapter 5). 

88

3. CLIMATE CHANGE

The costs of taking no further action on climate change are likely to be significant,
though estimating them is challenging. The types of costs range from those that can easily
be valued in economic terms – such as losses in the agricultural and forestry sectors – to
those that are more  intangible – such  as the  cost of biodiversity loss  and  catastrophic
events like the potential shutdown of the Atlantic overturning circulation. Cost estimates
vary due to the inclusion of different categories of cost and incomplete information. Most
studies do not include non-market impacts, such as the impacts on biodiversity. A few
include impacts associated with extreme weather events (e.g. Alberth and Hope, 2006) and
low-probability  catastrophic  events  (e.g Nordhaus,  2007).  Depending  on  the  scale  of
impacts covered in the models and the discount rate used, the discounted value of the
costs of taking no further action to tackle climate change could equate to a permanent loss
of  world  per-capita  consumption  of  between  2%  to  more  than  14%  (Stern, 2006;
OECD, 2008a).

These  considerations  must  also be  weighed  against  the  potential  of  extreme  and
sudden changes to natural and human systems. The impacts of these low-probability but
high-impact  changes  could  have  very  significant  or  even  catastrophic  economic
consequences (Weitzman, 2009). Some argue that in such contexts standard cost-benefit
analyses may not be appropriate. It may be better to approach the issue in terms of risk
management, using for example “safe minimum standards” (Dietz et al., 2006) and “more
explicit contingency planning for bad outcomes” (Weitzman, 2009; 2011).10 In this context,
assessments need to take into account the uncertainties involved; and decision making
should  be  informed  as  much  through  sensitivity analysis  which  includes  the extreme
numbers as through central estimates. From a political perspective, the Cancún agreement
to focus (at least partly) on the so-called 2 oC goal (see Section 1) has already established a
political goal based on scientific evidence. This suggests that the world’s governments find
that the costs of allowing the temperature increase to go beyond 2 oC outweigh the costs of
transitioning to a low-carbon economy. 

3. Climate change: The state of policy today

This section first outlines the international framework for climate change mitigation
and adaptation, before dealing with the current policies and challenges facing these two
areas of action at the national level.

The international challenge: Overcoming inertia

Tackling climate change presents nations with an international policy dilemma of an
unprecedented scale. Climate change mitigation is an example of a global public good
(Harding, 1968): each country is being asked  to incur costs – sometimes significant – to
reduce GHG emissions, but the benefits of such efforts are shared globally. Other factors
which complicate the policy challenge include the delay between the GHG being emitted
and the impacts on the climate, with some of the most severe impacts not projected to
materialise until the last half of this century. Climate impacts and the largest benefits of
mitigation action are also likely to be distributed unevenly across a range of countries, with
developing countries likely to suffer most from unabated climate change, in addition to
having the least capacity to adapt. This means that although at the global level benefits of
climate  action  are  significant,  country  incentives  to  mitigate  climate  change  are  not
sufficient to trigger the deep and urgent levels of mitigation required (OECD, 2009a).

3. CLIMATE CHANGE

Concerted international co-operation will be needed to overcome these strong free-
rider effects that are causing individual regions and countries to delay action (Barrett, 1994;
Stern, 2006). This will need to be underpinned by international agreements and include the
use of financial transfers to encourage broad engagement by all economies. Creating an
international  architecture  to  advance  climate  mitigation  also  requires  even  stronger
co-operation  for  low-carbon  technology  transfer  and  institutional capacity  building to
support action in developing countries. To be successful and widely accepted, international
co-operation on climate change will also need to address equity and fairness concerns,
issues which are often referred to as the “burden sharing” elements of the international
regime.

Signature of the UNFCCC in 1992 was a first step towards achieving a global policy
response  to  the  climate  change  problem.  Countries  who  signed  the  convention  (the
“Parties”) have agreed to work collectively to achieve its ultimate objective: “stabilization of
GHG-concentrations  in  the  atmosphere  at  a  level  that  would  prevent  dangerous
anthropogenic interference of the climate system” (Article 2, UNFCCC11). By signing this
convention, OECD and other industrialised economies (known as the Annex I Parties)12
agreed to take the lead to achieve this objective, and to provide financial and technical
assistance to other countries (non-Annex I13 Parties) to help them address climate change.
In 2005, the Kyoto Protocol entered into force and this created a legal obligation for Annex I
Parties14 to limit or reduce their GHG emissions between 2008 and 2012 to within agreed
emission levels. By 2009, CO2-emission levels for the group of countries participating in the
Kyoto protocol were 14.7% below their 1990 level (IEA, 2011a), although with significant
differences among countries.

Recent scientific evidence of climate change, including that provided in IPCC work, has
led to agreement about the specific details of Article 2 of the Convention. This resulted in
a statement in the 2010 Cancún Agreements that:

“… recognizes that deep cuts in global GHG emissions are required (…), with a view to
reducing  global  GHG  emissions  so  as  to  hold  the  increase  in  global  average
temperature below 2 oC above preindustrial levels, (…) also recognizes the need to
consider, in the context of the first review, strengthening the long-term global goal on
the basis of the best available scientific knowledge, including in relation to a global
average temperature rise of 1.5 oC” (UNFCCC, 2011a).
Another step forward has been the mitigation pledges made by many countries – both
developed and developing – first in the 2009 Copenhagen Accord and later in the Cancún
Agreements, to reduce emissions by 2020 (see Table 3.6 in Section 4; UNFCCC, 2009; and
UNFCCC, 2011a).15 Our analysis of all these pledges and commitments, however, shows
that without significant further action post-2020, they are unlikely to be sufficient to stay
within the 2 oC goal (see Section 4 and UNEP, 2010). 

In order to share equitably the burden of action needed to meet the 2 oC goal, the
Cancún Agreements reiterated the commitment by developed countries to provide new
and additional financial resources to developing countries for climate action. This will
include “Fast Start Finance” of USD 30 billion between 2010 and 2012, with a longer-term
goal  of  raising  USD 100 billion  per  year  by 2020  from  public  and  private  sources.16
Countries  also  agreed  in  Cancún  to  establish  a  Green  Climate  Fund  that  will  support
projects, programmes, policies and other activities in developing countries.17 Nevertheless,
significant  challenges  remain  in  the  international  climate  negotiations  regarding  the

future of the Kyoto Protocol and its instruments after it expires in 2012, and on the ability
for governments to unlock additional finance and to monitor, report and verify those flows. 
Until the 7th Conference of the Parties (COP7) in Marrakech in 2001, adaptation had
received less attention in the international negotiation process, though it was mentioned
in both the UNFCCC and the Kyoto Protocol. Parties at COP7 established three funds dealing
with adaptation, the Least Developed Countries Fund, the Special Climate Change Fund
and the Adaptation Fund. Adaptation has received more attention since then. The Cancún
Agreements stressed the importance of adaptation and established a Cancún Adaptation
Framework  with  an  associated  Adaptation  Committee.  The  Green  Climate  Fund  also
recognises the need for balanced treatment of adaptation and mitigation. 

National action to mitigate climate change

Despite some progress and the media attention focused on the global summits, only
decisive policy  action  at  the  national  level will limit local and global climate risks. To
achieve  the  2 oC  goal,  economies  worldwide  will  have  to  go  through  unprecedented
transformations in terms of energy production, consumption, transport and agriculture
patterns. The transition to a low-carbon, climate resilient economy will require significant
investments in mitigation and adaptation, and a shift of investment from fossil fuels and
conventional  technologies  to  newer,  cleaner  technologies  and  less  carbon-intensive
infrastructure. In the context of tight government budgets, finding least-cost solutions and
engaging the private sector will be critical to finance the transition (OECD, 2012), and costly
overlaps between policies must be avoided (OECD, 2011b). Government intervention will be
needed to overcome existing barriers and create the appropriate market conditions for
green investments. 

The multiple market failures presented  by climate change call  for  a  mix of policy
instruments  to  cut  GHG  emissions  effectively.  While  there  is  no  single  recipe  for  a
successful climate policy mix, there are certainly some important common ingredients, as
noted  by  the  OECD  Green  Growth  Strategy  (OECD, 2011e)  and  earlier  OECD  work
(OECD, 2011a; OECD, 2009a; Duval, 2008). Key elements of a least-cost policy mix include
(Table 3.1):

■ national climate change strategies;

■ price-based  instruments,  e.g. cap  and  trade,  carbon  taxes  and  removing  fossil  fuels

subsidies;

command and control instruments and regulations;

technology support policies, including R&D;

■ voluntary approaches, public awareness campaigns and information tools.

Each of these is discussed in turn below. 

National climate change strategies and legislation

The  Cancún  Agreements  state  that  industrialised  countries  should  develop  low-
carbon development plans and strategies and also assess how best to meet them, including
through market mechanisms. Developing countries are encouraged to do the same. Many
industrialised  countries have already  developed  national laws or  strategies to address
climate  change.  The  objective  of  these  tends  to  be  centred  on  achieving  Kyoto
commitments and/or medium- to long-term emissions reduction targets. These targets,

plans  or  strategies  are  essential  within  a  policy  framework  to  encourage  and  steer
investment to low-carbon, climate resilient outcomes; they also provide a long-term, stable
investment  signal  to  the  private  sector  (Clapp et al.,  2010;  Buchner, 2007;  Bowen  and
Rydge, 2011). 

National climate policy frameworks are emerging in Annex I countries, some of which
establish legally binding, economy-wide emission constraints and/or long-term emission
goals (Table 3.2). These aim to implement, reinforce or – in some cases – go beyond the
country’s international obligations. For example, the United Kingdom has a legally binding
absolute emissions reduction target of at least 34% below 1990 levels by 2020 and at least
80% below 1990 levels by 2050 in its Low Carbon Transition Plan (LCTP). It introduces the
concept of five-year carbon budget periods with binding milestones, beginning in 2008.
The European Union’s “20-20-20 Energy and Climate Package”, adopted in January 2008, is
an example of a comprehensive and legally binding climate strategy with three different
objectives: 

i) A  reduction  of  GHG  emissions  by  at  least  20%  compared  to 1990  by 2020,  with  a
commitment to increase it to 30% if a satisfactory international agreement is reached. 

ii) A target of 20% of energy coming from renewable sources by 2020, supplemented by

10% of renewable transport fuel. 

iii) A commitment to reduce the European Union’s energy consumption by 20% compared

to the Baseline in 2020.

In the United States, there is no federal law or economy-wide commitment to reduce
GHG emissions, but the United States is bound by law to achieve reductions as a result of a
Supreme Court case (Massachusetts v. EPA18). Fuel-efficiency standards for transport and
stationary power plants have been finalised for 2012-2016 and regulations for 2017-2025
are  in  the  process  of  being  proposed.  Also,  following  another  two  court  cases  and
settlement agreements, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will  regulate GHGs
from oil refineries and electric utilities by mid-2012. 

Table 3.2 shows  the  emerging  range  of  national  climate  policy  and  legislative
frameworks, based on  the  Climate Legislation Study conducted  by the Global  Legislators
Organisation (GLOBE). The study considers various areas of mitigation: specific energy-
efficiency policies, carbon pricing, renewable energy and transport, as well as activities
that can help both in adaptation and mitigation, such as forestry and land use. The authors
analyse “flagship” legislation – a key piece of legislation on climate change policy – and
consider the different sectoral priorities of the countries. Table 3.2 only considers activities
implemented at national level, and not at local or regional level.

Countries have also devised a variety of planning and strategy tools to meet specific
targets, building on collection and analysis of historical trend data and often using model-
based  projections.  France  is  undertaking  a  projection  exercise  to  forecast  energy
consumption and GHG emissions to 2030 and to inform policy makers and stakeholders
about  progress  to  date  and  the  need  for  further  action.  Japan  has  used  model-based
projections to prepare a roadmap for policy and measures to achieve a reduction of GHG
emissions by 25% below 1990 levels by 2020 and 80% by 2050. Japan has developed the Asia-
Pacific Integrated Model (AIM) and jointly used it in collaboration with institutes in other
Asian countries to assess climate policy options through the low carbon scenario exercises.
It is also using the modelling tool to work with sub-national stakeholders in regions and
cities,  as  well  as  at  the  national  level,  to  inform  dialogue  and  decision  making  about
climate  policy.  Experiences  from  all  these  collaborative  activities  are  shared  among
researchers and policy makers through the International Research Network for Low Carbon
Societies (LCS-RNet), a platform to link policies and researchers in the field of low-carbon
strategies.

Price-based instruments 

Putting a clear, credible and long-term price on carbon emissions across the economy
through market-based instruments such as emission trading schemes or carbon taxes is
necessary to drive investments in low-carbon technologies. It penalises carbon-intensive
technologies and processes, creates markets for low-carbon technologies (e.g. for energy
efficiency,  solar,  wind energy  and  carbon  capture  and  storage  [CCS]19) and stimulates
action in the energy, industry, transport and agriculture sectors. Putting a price on carbon
can also help trigger green innovations and enhance energy efficiency (OECD, 2010b). 

Emission trading schemes. Under emission trading systems (ETS) – often referred to as
“cap and trade” – a central authority (usually a government body) sets a limit or cap on the
amount of a pollutant that can be emitted. The limit or cap is allocated or sold to firms in
the form of emissions permits which represent the right to emit or discharge a specific
volume of  the  specified  pollutant. Firms  are  required to hold  a number of permits (or
carbon credits) equivalent to their emissions. The total number of permits cannot exceed
the cap, limiting total emissions to that level. Firms that need to increase their emission
permits must buy permits from those who require fewer permits. In effect, the buyer is
paying  a  charge  for  polluting,  while  the  seller  is  being  rewarded  for  having  reduced
emissions.  Thus,  in  theory, those  who can  reduce  emissions most  cheaply  will  do  so,
achieving the pollution reduction at the lowest cost to society. 

Emission trading schemes are becoming increasingly important in the climate policy
portfolio.  In  the  last  10 years,  almost  all  Annex I  Parties  have  either  established  or
strengthened  existing  trading  schemes  and  are  in  some  way  participating  in  either
national or international carbon markets (UNFCCC, 2011b; Hood 2010). As of March 2011,
there were seven active GHG-emissions trading schemes in OECD countries (some of which
are sub-national), and several more under discussion, including in developing countries
(Table 3.3). Nevertheless, there are several issues that need to be considered in order to
increase  the  environmental  effectiveness  and  economic  efficiency of  permit  trading
(e.g. the choice between a cap-and-trade system versus a Baseline-and-credit system;20 the
initial allocation of the emission allowances; and ways of limiting the transaction costs
associated with the permit trading system) (OECD, 2008b).

The EU-Emission Trading Scheme (EU-ETS) is the world’s largest emissions trading
system and has led the way in building an international carbon market (Box 3.4). Outside
the European Union, the New Zealand emissions trading scheme is the most developed. It
is more comprehensive than any other trading schemes, covering all six Kyoto Protocol
gases (CO2, CH4, N2O, HFCs, PFCs and SF6) from energy, transport, industry, waste, synthetic
gases, and forestry sectors. It began operating in 2008 in the forestry sector, adding energy,
industry  and  transportation  in 2010.  A  recent  independent  review  of  the  scheme  has
recommended that it should continue beyond 2012, although with changes to aspects of its
design (Emissions Trading Scheme Review Panel, 2011). 

To promote green electricity, several countries use quotas and certificates which allow
sectors a certain level of emissions. They are tradable and are thus in effect market-based
instruments.  The  certificates  are  usually  not  accounted  for  in  tonnes  of  CO2,  but  in
amounts of energy produced from different sources (e.g. green certificates for energy from
renewable sources, white certificates for energy savings, blue certificates for electricity
production from combined heat and power). Such national trading schemes are in use in
Poland, Sweden, the United Kingdom, Italy, Belgium, and some US states. Energy savings
programmes (white certificates) are used in France, Demark, Italy, the United Kingdom,
Australia, Belgium and around 30 US States. The Australian Renewable Energy Target (RET)
of 20% by 2020 is implemented through a system of tradable green certificates known as
renewable energy certificates. Quotas and feed-in tariffs have been used extensively in the
energy sector in the European Union under the “20-20-20 Energy and Climate Package”
(see above). Most EU member states use feed-in tariffs to meet their renewable energy
target,  while  others –  such  as  Poland,  Romania  and  Sweden –  use  green  certificates.
Belgium, Italy and the United Kingdom use both feed-in tariffs and certificates. 

In  the  absence  of  national  regulation  in  a  number  of  countries,  sub-national
governments, states and cities have initiated mandatory emission trading schemes. For
example, the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) began operating in 2009 as a CO2
cap-and-trade programme for electricity generators in 10 of the northeastern US States;
and  Tokyo in Japan  has  implemented the  first local  government-level CO2  ETS.  Offset
market mechanisms21 (such as the Clean Development Mechanism – see below – and Joint

Implementation22) could be designed to provide better carbon  market access to urban
mitigation projects so as to tap the potential for cost-effective mitigation in this area,
(Clapp et al., 2010).

Box 3.4. The EU-Emissions Trading Scheme: Recent developments 

Launched  in  January 2005,  the  EU-Emissions  Trading  Scheme  is  the  world’s  largest
trading  scheme,  operating  in  30 countries*  and  covering  more  than  10 900 large
installations in Europe, such as power stations, combustion plants, oil refineries, iron and
steel works, and factories making cement, glass, lime, bricks, ceramics, pulp and paper.
The installations currently covered account for half of the European Union’s CO2 emissions
(40% of GHG emissions). The EU-ETS faced significant challenges in its first two phases
(2005-2007 and 2008-2012),  such  as  over-allocation  of  permits,  windfall  profits  for
electricity  generators  due  to free  allocation  systems,  and price  volatility, all of  which
reduced the efficiency of the scheme. However, it has shown that the price signal has been
effective in promoting low carbon pathways.

For Phase III (2013-20), European Union heads of state and government and the European

Parliament have revised legislation to include the following changes: 

a single EU-wide cap instead of 27 national caps; 

■ more  allowances  auctioned  (50%  or  more  by 2013,  rising  to  100%  over  time)  to  avoid

windfall profits;

■ harmonisation of rules governing free allocation of emissions and extending coverage to

petrochemicals, aluminium, ammonia, and new gases, including N20 and PFCs;

■ higher rate of free allocation (based on benchmarks) for sectors and sub-sectors considered

at risk of carbon leakage, in the absence of a comprehensive international agreement;

coverage of domestic and international aviation emissions from 2012.

* This includes EU27 and Norway, Iceland and Lichtenstein.

Carbon taxes. Carbon taxes are a cost effective way to reduce emissions. These taxes
provide incentives for polluters and resource users to change their behaviour today. They
also  provide  long-term incentives to innovate. Although carbon taxes are not strongly
supported by the public in all contexts, there are various ways in which this support can be
increased over time (e.g. through measures to limit negative impacts on the competitiveness
of certain sectors and/or on income distribution) (OECD, 2008a). 

Countries  are  increasingly  considering  ETSs  and  carbon  taxes  as  complementary
measures, with the former targeting energy-intensive sectors and the latter targeting the
residential and commercial sector (UNFCCC, 2011b). Where carbon taxes are in place, they
are usually applied to fuels and electricity so that prices reflect their CO2-emission factors.
It  is,  however,  important  to  note that  if  electricity  generation  is  covered  by  a  trading
scheme  (as  for  example  in  the  EU  ETS),  taxes  on  electricity  use  will  not  affect  total
CO2 emissions (OECD, 2011f). 

Carbon taxes are currently used in 10 OECD countries, with Denmark, Finland, the
Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom leading these efforts since the

96

3. CLIMATE CHANGE

early 1990s (OECD, 2009a). Sweden was one of the first countries to introduce a carbon tax
in 1991, with the general level of the tax increasing over the years to reach EUR 111 per
tonne  in 2010.  A  positive  side  effect  of  the  UK’s  Climate  Change  Levy,  which  taxes
industrial  and  commercial  GHG-emitting  power  production,  has  been  to  stimulate
innovation (OECD, 2010b). Those companies that pay a lower-than-normal tax rate under
negotiated Climate Change Agreements (which entitle them to an 80% discount off the tax
liability, provided they adopt a binding target on their energy use)23 have registered fewer
patents for inventions to tackle climate change than those that pay the full levy. In Canada,
British Colombia (BC) has had a carbon tax in place since 2008.24 The carbon tax is a critical
component of BC’s Climate Action Plan to reduce GHG emissions by 33% by 2020.

The state of play in developing countries. E m e rg in g  e c on om i es   a n d   deve lo pi n g
countries are already participating in carbon markets  through  the  Clean Development
Mechanism  (CDM)  implemented  under  the  Kyoto  Protocol.25  A  further  deepening  and
extension  of  carbon  markets  could  enable substantial  transfers of  private  funds  from
developed to developing countries. In the near term, the main channel for such transfers
may be based on scaled-up versions of existing crediting mechanisms such as the CDM.
Improving  the  CDM  framework,  supporting  institutions,  and  addressing  barriers  to
investments through this mechanism could increase the potential for attracting financial
flows  for  mitigation  in  developing  countries  (Ellis  and  Kamel, 2007).  Well-functioning
crediting mechanisms also reduce the global cost of mitigation (OECD, 2009a).

Some developing countries are also investigating domestic market-based instruments
to mitigate GHG emissions. For example, in July 2010 India introduced a national clean
energy tax on both imported and domestically produced coal to fund R&D in renewable
energy  technologies.  In  April 2011  it  implemented  a  scheme  called  “Perform  Achieve
Trade”, to improve the energy efficiency of large energy-intensive industries (GoI, 2010). In
September 2010 South Africa introduced a carbon related rate differentiation on taxes for
new vehicles. It also plans carbon taxes to meet its national long-term mitigation scenarios
(South Africa Revenue Service, 2010). In China, 10 areas have been selected to draft plans to
reduce their carbon emissions under a low-carbon pilot programme researching the use of
market mechanisms to promote emissions reductions. Announcements have been made
on the launch of a domestic ETS in 2015 (Reuters, 2011). In 2009, Brazil launched a National
Climate Change policy outlining its commitments to reduce GHG emissions by 36%-40% of
projected  emissions  by 2020.  It  plans  to  draft  specific  legislation  for  tax  measures  to
stimulate emission reductions (Government of Brazil, 2008). Indonesia released its climate
change green paper in December 2009, which suggested carbon pricing initially through a
carbon tax, indicating that later transition to emissions trading is a possibility. While the
emergence  of  all  these  trading  schemes  is  encouraging,  fragmented  markets  are  less
efficient and effective than one global market (see Section 4 for a discussion).

Removing environmentally harmful subsidies. Removing  or  reforming  inefficient  and
environmentally  harmful  support  to  fossil  fuel  production  and  consumption  is  an
important  step  in  “getting  the  prices  right”  on  GHG  emissions.  Reforming  fossil  fuel
support can help to shift the economy away from activities that emit CO2, can encourage
energy  efficiency,  and  can  promote  the  development  and  diffusion  of  low-carbon
technologies  and  renewable  energy  sources  (Section 4 presents  a  model  simulation  of
reforming  fossil fuel subsidies).  Furthermore, removing  fossil fuel subsidies and  other

OECD ENVIRONMENTAL OUTLOOK TO 2050 © OECD 2012

97

3. CLIMATE CHANGE

support  will  save  money  for  governments  and  taxpayers.  An  inventory  of  24 OECD
countries indicates that fossil fuel production and use in these countries was supported by
about USD 45-75 billion per year between 2005 and 2010 (OECD, 2011b). The inventory is a
first step towards increased transparency on fossil fuel support, but further analysis of the
merits of the individual measures is needed to understand which might be harmful or
inefficient.  Fossil  fuel  consumption  subsidies  in  developing  and  emerging  economies
amounted to more than USD 300 billion in 2009, increasing to just over USD 400 billion
in 2010 (IEA, 2011b).

Removing those subsidies that are inefficient can however be politically challenging,
and  may  also  lead  to  more  use  of  traditional  bioenergy  in  developing  countries  with
potentially  negative  health  effects  (see Chapter 6 on  health  and  environment).  The
combustion of traditional bioenergy is associated with high black carbon emissions, and
these  can also  contribute  to  climate  change.  As  a  result,  reform of  fossil  fuel support
should be implemented carefully, in particular to ensure that potential negative impacts on
household  affordability  and  well-being  are  mitigated  through  appropriate  measures
(e.g. means-tested social safety net programmes). 

Regulations and command-and-control instruments

Regulations are needed in a policy mix along with market-based instruments, and can
be  most  appropriate  where  markets  cannot  provide  price  signals  to  individuals  or
organisations that reflect the costs of polluting behaviour. This can be the case where, for
example, pollution cannot be adequately monitored at source or there is no good proxy
that  could  be  subject  to taxation.  Regulatory  approaches  may  also be  more  politically
feasible where certain sectors are strongly against tax increases. The design of regulations
is important. They should be: 

closely targeted to the policy goal;

stringent enough so that the benefits outweigh the cost;

stable enough to give investors confidence;

flexible enough to foster genuinely novel solution;

■ updated regularly to provide incentives for continuous innovation. 

In the transport sector, fuel-economy and CO2-emission standards are increasingly
mandatory, and have been widely implemented in many countries. Fleet renewal schemes
have also been introduced, but they have shown mixed results. They are often put in place
as a way of stimulating consumer spending and/or assisting car manufacturers in times of
economic  recession.  During  the  economic  crisis  of 2008-2009,  several  countries
implemented fleet renewal schemes as part of economic stimulus plans, claiming that
they would also deliver significant CO2 and pollution reduction benefits as new cars are
more fuel efficient than the old fleet. However, an analysis of such programmes in France,
Germany and the United States suggests that they are not cost effective (OECD/ITF, 2011).
There is also a risk of significant rebound effects (see below) if fuel prices are not increased
at the same time (as the cost per kilometre of driving decreases with higher fuel efficiency).

Regulations are also used to reduce emissions of gases that are subject to the Montreal
Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer. For example, Australia has the Ozone
Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Management regulation; the European Union
has  directives  on  fluorinated  gases,  mobile  air  conditioning  and  integrated  pollution

prevention  and  control;  and  the  United  States  has  a  Significant  New  Alternatives
Programme.26  Regulations  have  also  long  contributed  to  landfill  methane  emissions
reductions as well as industrial N2O and HFC reduction in industrialised countries. For
example, France’s industrial N2O emissions were cut by 90% in the 1990s through those
schemes.

Energy-efficiency  measures  can  be  encouraged  by  carbon  pricing  (see above),  but
might  require  additional  targeted  regulatory  instruments  (such  as  fuel,  vehicle  and
building-efficiency standards). If well designed to target market barriers27 and avoid costly
overlap  with  market-based  instruments,  these  measures can  accelerate the uptake  of
clean  technologies,  promote  innovation  and  support  cost-effective  mitigation.  Policy
makers should pay attention also to the “rebound effects”: higher efficiency without proper
pricing will lower the costs of using the equipment in question, hence providing a potential
incentive to use it more intensively. Mixing energy-efficiency measures and carbon pricing
is therefore critical (OECD, 2009a).

Fostering innovation and supporting green technologies

Technological  innovation  is  key  for  the  transition  to  a  low-carbon  economy.  For
example, OECD work shows that the cost of mitigation in 2050 could be halved, from about
4% to 2% of GDP, if R&D could come up with two carbon-free backstop technologies in the
electricity and non-electricity sectors (OECD, 2011c). However, fostering innovation faces a
number  of challenges. First,  it  is  difficult  for  firms  to appropriate  the  returns  to their
investments in innovation (see Box 3.5). Second, specific barriers to entry exist for new
technologies and competitors due to the prevalence of dominant designs in energy and
transport markets. 

The  following  three  factors  are  necessary  to  foster  innovation  in  low-carbon

technologies. Each is discussed further in the sections which follow: 

i)

Public investment in basic research: this area is often too risky or uncertain for private-
sector investments. International co-operation could help to share the cost of public
investment,  improve  access  to  knowledge  and  foster  international  transfer  of
technologies. 

ii) Carbon pricing: without this, potential users will have few incentives to take up any low-
carbon technologies that are invented – this significantly reduces the incentives to develop
such innovations. However, carbon pricing alone is unlikely to be sufficient to drive short-
term investments in costly technologies that have long-term CO2 reduction impact. 

iii) Public  policy  framework,  tools  and  instruments:  these  can  help  to  overcome  the
dominance  of  existing  technologies,  systems  and  firms,  again  through  the
establishment of competitive market conditions, as well as public support for R&D and
in the commercialisation of green innovations.

Public investment in basic research. More investment in low-carbon energy technology
research, development and demonstration (RD&D) is needed, including direct government
funding,  grants  and  private-sector  investment.  After  years  of  stagnation,  government
spending on low-carbon energy technologies has risen. But current levels still fall well
short  of  what  is  needed  to  deliver  green  growth  (Figure 3.14).  The  current  tight  fiscal
situations  faced  by  many  governments  may  further  limit  public  spending  on  energy-
related R&D.

In 2009, governments of both the Major Economies Forum28 and the IEA intervened
directly in energy markets in order to promote investment in low-carbon technologies,
such as renewable energy power plants, with a view to doubling investments in low-carbon
RD&D by 2015. Such measures appear to have had some success (Box 3.5). 

However, simply increasing funding will not be enough to deliver the necessary low-
carbon  technologies.  Current  government  RD&D  programmes  and  policies  need  to  be
improved by adopting  best  practices in  design and  implementation. This includes the
design of strategic programmes to fit national policy priorities and resource availability; the
rigorous evaluation of results and adjusting support if needed; and the increase of linkages
between government and industry, and between  the basic science and applied energy
research communities to accelerate innovation. Examples of public support for RD&D in
low-carbon technology include the European Technology Platform Programme29 (2007-2013)
and the Innovation and New Technology30 programme support in Germany.

Using carbon pricing to spur innovation. Spurring innovation in low-carbon technologies
would require a higher price of carbon than the price set by current initiatives. Governments
can  intervene  with  additional  targeted  policies  to  raise  the  carbon  price  and  create  a
market for low-carbon alternatives (Box 3.5). OECD work demonstrates that carbon pricing
provides  much  broader  innovation  incentives  than  technology  adoption  subsidies
(OECD, 2010b).  Subsidies  can  encourage  the  adoption  of  low-carbon  technologies  and
market transformations, but are an expensive option, especially when public budgets are
strained. 

Technology deployment subsidies. Most new technologies will require, at some stage,
both the “push” of RD&D and the “pull” of market deployment (IEA, 2009b). The over-riding
objectives of public policy should be to reduce some of the financial and policy risk of

Box 3.5. The growth in renewable energy power plants 

Figure 3.15 gives an overview of the total plant entry capacities (measured in megawatts
electric) for major renewable energy sources – wind, solar, biomass and geothermal – built
between 1978 and 2008. The increasing trend for investment in renewable energy power
facilities in all regions since 1997 coincides with the agreement and implementation of the
Kyoto Protocol. In this period, developed-country governments have provided targeted
support  for  renewable  energy  investment,  which  can  be  justified  by  the  relative
immaturity of these technologies. This immaturity makes it more difficult for lenders to
accurately price relative risk of investments in “clean” energy, and thus for investors in the
sector  to  obtain  financing  at  reasonable  cost.  Moreover,  in  some  cases  there  can  be
important learning and demonstration effects, which will not be realised without initial
support (Kalamova et al., 2011). At the same time, the rate of entry of coal and oil-based
plants plummeted in these countries.

investing  in  new,  low-carbon  technologies,  stimulate  uptake  and  bring  down  costs.
Evidence suggests that a large proportion of breakthrough innovations tend to come from
new firms that challenge existing business models. Thus, government measures to remove
barriers to entry and to support growth of new firms have an important part to play in low
carbon energy technology development.

Government-support policies need to be appropriately tailored to different stages of
technology  development  and  should  be  based  on  assessments  of  expected  costs  and
expected benefits – taking any interactions with other instruments into account. Examples
of technology support policies include minimum feed-in tariffs for electricity production
from  renewable  sources,  differentiated  purchase  taxes  on  automobiles  based  on  fuel
economy, and grants, loans and guarantees for emission mitigation projects. However,
technology-specific  policies  risk  “locking  in”  outdated  technology  and  can  dampen

incentives  to innovate and  search for cheaper and better abatement options. It is also
important  to  consider  carefully  how  these  policies  interact  with  any  caps  on  total
emissions that might be in place (OECD, 2011b). The policies should be carefully designed
to avoid capture by vested interests and regularly evaluated to make sure they are efficient
and directed towards policy objectives. While predictability and long-term policy signals
are necessary if investors are to invest in low-carbon energy technologies, predictability
should not be equated with permanence. It is important to phase out technology support
policies.

OECD work on innovation suggests that general factors beyond technology support
policies may also play a key role in inducing clean technology innovation and diffusion
(OECD, 2011g). General market conditions such as competition policy, intellectual property
regimes, and education policy are important complements to direct technology support
policies. Also, the stringency of the environmental policy framework matters (e.g. level of
emission caps or carbon price) as well as the predictability and the flexibility of policy
regimes. Governments could be tempted to “pick winners”, but it is more efficient to be
technology neutral. The use of “flexible” environmental policy instruments is one means of
ensuring neutrality. If targeted support is required, it may be more efficient to support
general infrastructure or technologies which benefit a wide range of applications, such as
improved energy storage and grid management in the electricity sector. The design of the
schemes  plays  a  critical  role,  to  ensure  competitive  selection  processes,  focus  on
performance,  avoid  vested  interests  and  ensure  evaluation  of  policies  (Johnstone  and
Haščič 2009; Haščič et al., 2010)

Voluntary approaches, public awareness campaigns and information tools

Information instruments, education and public awareness programmes encourage
consumer and investor behavioural changes by improving the availability and accuracy of
information. They include labels indicating the energy and emissions profile for appliances
and automobiles, audits for buildings and  plants, and dissemination of best practices.
Many energy-efficiency improvements, such as phasing-out incandescent lamps, can cost
little  or  nothing  to  implement,  but  can  bring  potentially  large  and  rapid  emission
reductions.  However,  people  need  to  be persuaded  to  take  them  up.  Well-designed
information-based instruments, such as energy-efficiency labels on household appliances,
combined  with  market-based  and  regulatory  tools,  can  be  an  effective  approach
(OECD, 2007a, b; OECD, 2011d; Box 3.6).

Labelling  the  environmental  characteristics  of  products –  such  as  their  carbon
footprint – is becoming increasingly popular. In the United States, the retailer Wal-Mart
obliges some of its suppliers to use carbon indicators. In the United Kingdom, highlighting
the carbon footprint of different goods and services is also becoming common. The EU
Energy  Label  or  Energy  Star  labels  (used  in  Canada,  the  European  Union,  Japan,  New
Zealand, Taiwan and the United States) have been in place for several years. Currently
none  of  these  schemes  is  mandatory,  although  under  France’s  Grenelle  Law  for  the
environment,  the  government  plans  to  make  labelling  of  a  number  of  environmental
indicators on certain products a legal requirement from 2012.

The use of voluntary approaches has declined in recent years in Annex I countries to
the benefit of binding instruments and regulations (UNFCCC, 2011b). Although voluntary
arrangements should not be viewed as a replacement for mandatory mitigation policies,
carbon prices and other climate policies, they can strengthen domestic climate policies.

Box 3.6. Greening household behaviour: The role of public policies

As consumers account for 60% of final consumption in the OECD area, their purchasing
decisions have a major impact on the extent to which markets can work to promote green
products. However, their decisions to buy “green” depends on the financial cost of green
options  and  the  infrastructure  to  support  such  choices;  the  quality  and  reliability  of
information on the products; and the knowledge consumers have of environmental issues.
Industry, government and civil society can play an important role in creating the enabling
environment for consumers to make greener purchasing choices.

Recent OECD work on environmental policy and household behaviour is exploring the
factors driving households’ environment-related decisions in order to inform policy design
and  implementation.  A  survey  of  over  10 000 households  across  10 OECD  countries
(Australia, Canada, Czech Republic, France, Italy, Korea, Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway
and Sweden) confirms the impact of economic incentives on household behaviour and the
important complementary role played by information-based measures such as energy-
efficiency labelling of appliances and housing.

The findings confirm the importance of providing the right economic incentive to spur
behavioural  changes,  in  particular  in  energy  and  water  savings.  The  evidence  also
indicates that pricing consumption by volume is partially useful – the mere act of metering
and introducing a price on the use of natural resources has an effect on people’s decision
making. The survey indicates that “softer” instruments, such as information to consumers
and  public  education,  can  play  a  substantial  complementary  role.  Eco  labels  are
particularly useful, as long as they are clear and comprehensible, and that they identify
both “public” and  “private” benefits.  These “soft” instruments need to be  given close
attention in developing more comprehensive  strategies for influencing consumer and
household environmental behaviour. 

Sources: OECD (2011d), Greening Household Behaviour, OECD Publishing. 

Their  adoption  is  often  much  easier  than  mandatory  instruments,  and  helps  raise
awareness of climate change issues. In Japan, voluntary measures such as the Keidanren’s
Voluntary  Action  Plan  played  a  role  in  reducing  industrial  GHG  emissions.  Voluntary
enterprise partnerships are particularly important in the United States to improve the
energy  performance  of  buildings  (Save  Energy  Now  and  Energy  Star  for  Industry
Programmes) and in the transport sector (SmartWayTransport Partnership). There are also
active programmes in the waste sector, such as the Landfill Methane Outreach Programme
in the United States aimed at reducing GHGs from landfills by supporting the recovery and
use of landfill gas for energy. 

Getting the policy mix right

The  previous  sections  have shown that there  is  no single  instrument  available to
policy makers for achieving a cost-effective reduction of GHG emissions. Instead, a mix of
policies  is  needed.  However,  poorly  designed  policy  mixes  can  result  in  undesirable
overlaps,  can  undermine  cost-effectiveness  and,  in  some  cases,  can  themselves  be
environmentally damaging (Duval, 2009; OECD, 2011b; Hood, 2011). The wide range of GHG
emissions-reducing policies available and the many possible interactions among them,
raise the issue of whether and how they can be integrated into a coherent framework. 

OECD ENVIRONMENTAL OUTLOOK TO 2050 © OECD 2012

103

3. CLIMATE CHANGE

For instance, a great advantage of cap-and-trade systems compared to most other
policy  instruments  is  that  they  give  all  sources  covered  an  equal  incentive  to  abate
emissions,  enhancing  the  cost-effectiveness  of  emission  abatement.  It  is,  however,
important  to  keep  in  mind  that  with  the  use  of  a  cap-and-trade  system,  other  policy
instruments addressing the same emission sources will only affect total emissions if they
allow  for  setting  a  stricter  emissions  cap  in  the  future.  As  long  as  the  cap  remains
unchanged,  overlapping  instruments  will  not  influence total  emissions,  and  will only
increase the overall cost of mitigation (OECD, 2011b).

Thus policies have to be designed as a package, taking these interactions into account.
In addition, interactions can happen beyond specific climate change policies. The cost-
effectiveness of global emission cuts can be further enhanced by reforming a number of
policies that either increase GHG emissions or distort the incentives – and, therefore, raise
the  cost –  of  mitigation  instruments.  These  include  fuel  tax  rebates,  energy  price
regulations and lack of property rights to forests in a number of developing countries, as
well as import barriers to emissions-reducing technologies and agricultural support in a
number of developed countries.

National action to adapt to climate change

The existing stock of GHG in the atmosphere means that the world is now committed
to several decades of climate change. Although changes in the climate are now inevitable,
the effects they will have on people and ecosystems will depend on the actions taken in
response  to  those  changes  (adaptation).  Adaptation  can  also  involve  harnessing  any
beneficial opportunities that may arise. 

Adaptation  encompasses  a  multitude  of  behavioural,  structural  and  technology
adjustments. As a result, there are many possible typologies of adaptation strategies and
instruments.  These  include  structural  and  technological  measures;  legislative  and
regulatory  instruments;  institutional  and  administrative  measures;  market-based
instruments; and on-site operations (Table 3.4). This section summarises the state of play
of many of these, focusing especially on: 

■ national adaptation strategies and risk assessments;

innovative insurance systems to reduce climate risks;

■ price signals and environmental markets to improve natural resource management;

the role of the private sector;

integrating adaptation into development co-operation.

For  regions  affected  by  particularly  extreme  events  or  climate  conditions,  many
adaptation measures may not be sufficient to offset the impacts. In these cases, the role of
early warnings and disaster risk management are particularly important.

National adaptation strategies and risk assessments

Establishing national adaptation strategies is particularly important to identify the
main climate vulnerabilities and to prioritise among them. Progress has been made in
implementing national strategies for adaptation, which also encourage the management
of climate risks in all relevant sectors. However, in a preliminary review of adaptation
actions undertaken by OECD countries, Gagnon-Lebrun and Agrawala (OECD, 2006) found
that  climate  change  impacts  and  adaptation  received  much  less  attention  within  the

National Communications (NCs)31 than discussions  on GHG  emissions and mitigation
policies.  Any discussion  on  impacts and adaptation  in  the NCs  was dominated by  the
assessment of future climatic changes and impacts. The discussion on adaptation is often
limited to identifying generic options rather than specific action plans or policies. However,
more recently, Bauer et al., (2011) show that adaptation and information on climate risks is
becoming more  integrated into  the  national  policies of  the countries  they  reviewed.32
Other studies similarly find that most countries do mention adaptation in their national
policies, but in most cases not as prominently as mitigation (Townshend et al., 2011; and
see Table 3.2).  However  if  one  includes  forestry  and  land-use  measures  as  a  part  of
adaptation (both have adaptation benefits), the coverage increases significantly. 

Assessing climate risks and vulnerabilities is fundamental for evaluating different
adaptation options at the national, local and project levels. Governments have invested
considerable effort in recent years in developing methodologies and tools to screen the
risks  posed  by  climate  change  and  to  conduct  vulnerability  assessments.  The  OECD
proposes the use of environmental impact assessment (EIA) or Strategic Environmental
Assessment (SEA) to incorporate climate change impacts and adaptation within existing
approaches  for  project  design,  approval  and  implementation  in  both  developed  and
developing countries (Agrawala et al., 2010a). Using an integrated framework to address
climate change in the context of other environmental impacts would also diminish the
risks of maladaptation, as an integrated assessment would ensure that a project does not
affect the vulnerability of natural and human systems. Although countries have shown

3. CLIMATE CHANGE

progress  in  examining  the  possibility  of  incorporating  climate  change  impacts  and
adaptation  measures within  EIA,  much less  has been  done  in adjusting  current policy
frameworks,  creating  guidance  and  actually  incorporating  climate  change  into  EIA.  A
recent assessment could only find examples from three countries – Australia, Canada, and
the Netherlands (Agrawala et al., 2010b). Some progress has been made in the use of SEA
(Agrawala et al., 2010a). For instance, Spain’s National Climate Change Adaptation Plan
includes  the  objective  of  mainstreaming  climate  change  adaptation  into  sectoral
legislation. 

There  are  significant  gaps  in  the  available  evidence  on  the  costs  and  benefits  of
adaptation. A review of this literature shows that there is  a relatively large amount of
information  available  about  adaptation  options  and  their  costs  at  the  sectoral  level,
although it is unevenly distributed across sectors and by applicable geographic coverage
(OECD , 2008c; Agrawala et al., 2011). In particular, there is a significant body of literature on
assessing adaptation in coastal zones and agriculture. By contrast, the information on
costs of adaptation is much less diffused for the water resources, energy, infrastructure,
tourism and public health sectors and limited largely to developed country contexts. A
notable  exception  is  Chile –  between 2008 and 2010  it  carried  out  the  first  ever
quantification of the impacts of climate change in eight river basins throughout its central
valley.  Such  information  is  also  very  context-specific,  making broader  generalisations
difficult.

Innovative insurance systems to reduce climate risks

There  is  a  long  track  record  of  insurance  provision  to  deal  with  weather  risks.
Insurance  schemes  will  need  to  consider  the  effects  of  increasing  climate  damage.
Insurance  companies  see climate  adaptation  insurance  mechanism  as  a  business
opportunity (NBS, 2009), and are developing new ways of spreading risk away from affected
communities while encouraging adaptation actions by exposed populations. They have
already  developed  specific  insurance  products  to  mitigate  climate  risks,  such  as  risk
transfer mechanisms; weather  related insurance  and  catastrophe bonds;  and  weather
index-based insurance, which are especially relevant for developing countries. Swiss Re,
through its Climate Adaptation Development Programme, has developed financial risk
transfer markets to tackle the effects of adverse weather in non-OECD countries through
partnerships with local insurers, banks, micro-finance institutions, government and NGOs
(PwC, 2011). It has already designed and implemented index-based weather risk transfer
instruments in India, Kenya, Mali and Ethiopia. 

Despite the encouraging developments in this area, the application of insurance to
climate  change  adaptation  faces  some  challenges.  These  mainly  concern  the  lack  of
available data and information on climate change. Government intervention is critical to
support  the  private  sector  through  gathering  information,  or  through  public  private
partnerships to share risk. Nevertheless, care should be taken, as in some cases insurance
may  not  be  viable33  and  subsidising  it  may  be  more  costly  and  more  likely  to  delay
adaptation (OECD, 2008c). Another critical role for governments is therefore to evaluate
whether the level of insurance cover is adequate and whether risk-sharing systems are fair.
They also might have to develop publicly funded adaptation measures that bring down
risks, or share the most extreme layer of risks with commercial insurers.

3. CLIMATE CHANGE

Price signals and environmental markets to improve natural resource management

Policies to price natural resources create incentives for owners to preserve natural
assets  and  for  consumers  to  use  them  carefully.  From  an  adaptation  point  of  view,
environmental markets and pricing, such as for ecosystem services, help to reduce stress
and  make  systems  more  resilient  to  climate  change.  They  also  help  to  monetise  the
adaptation services provided by ecosystems or other natural resources (see Chapter 4).
Examples of such  policies  include  water  prices  and  water markets,  and  payments  for
ecosystems  services  (e.g. watershed  protection,  carbon  sequestration,  biodiversity
protection and landscape and cultural preservation; see Chapter 4). Governments need to
ensure that  the trade-offs among the  financial sustainability  of  schemes, efficiency  of
allocation and social impacts are appropriately dealt with. 

The role of the private sector

In a context of tight government budgets in both developed and developing countries,
the private sector will have to play an important role in financing adaptation and can help
to  overcome  operational  constraints  and  accelerate  investment  in  infrastructure
(Agrawala et al., 2011). This is particularly relevant for expensive infrastructure investments,
such as the construction and operation of dedicated defence structures (flood barriers), or
the climate proofing of existing infrastructure (road, water systems and electric power
networks), which constitute the majority of the required adaptation funding. 

Some adaptation by private actors will take place out of self interest, as it will reduce
vulnerability and improve resilience to climate change. Business opportunities may also
arise  from  designing  new  products  or  entering  new  markets  when  implementing
adaptation  actions  (OECD, 2008c).  Reducing  or  managing  climate  change  risks  can
translate into competitive advantage, cost savings (though perhaps not in the short-term),
reduced liabilities, and investor confidence. In addition to internalising climate change
adaptation into their own decision-making processes, businesses can support local-level
adaptation by providing economic opportunities and growth, delivering services, providing
financial, technical and human resources, and influencing policy making. 

However, in some of the potentially worst  affected areas, such as low-lying island
states, the challenge is great and the necessary capacity for the private sector to reduce
vulnerability may be lacking. Private action may be insufficient because of external effects
or other market or information failures. Governments have to implement the right mix of
policy instruments to ensure the engagement of private actors in making timely, well-
informed,  and  efficient  adaptation  decisions.  Setting  up  the  right  incentive  and
partnership structures to promote adaptation will be a daunting task. 

Public  private partnerships  (PPPs) are one means for  governments to enhance the
adaptive capacity  of industries.  They  can  also play  a  significant  role  in  many  sectors,
especially by stimulating investments in R&D. Indeed, technological innovation is key to
reducing the cost of adapting to climate change. However, the public good nature of this
type of innovation may cause the private sector to underinvest in R&D. In such cases, policy
instruments need to be put in place to give the private-sector incentives to engage. PPPs
can  help  to  realign  research  incentives,  along  with  fiscal  incentives  and  intellectual
protection provided by appropriate policy frameworks (OECD, 2008c).

Integrating adaptation into development co-operation

The management of climate risks is closely intertwined with development activities
as  climate  change  has  a  particularly  strong  impact  on  the  poor  and  most  vulnerable
populations. International donor agencies are playing an important role in scaling up the
financing for adaptation and integrating climate change into development co-operation.
Donor agencies can support a variety of activities ranging from R&D and technological
development, to information gathering and diffusion, co-ordination or development of
adaptive  capacity.  In  order  to  support  donors  and  partner  countries,  the  OECD  has
developed guidance on Integrating Climate Change Adaptation into Development Co-operation,
which advocates a “whole-of-government” approach (OECD, 2009b). It proposes assessing
and addressing climate risks and opportunities within centralised national government
processes, at sectoral and project levels, as well as in urban and rural contexts. 

The  integration  of  adaptation  at  each  of  these  levels  requires  an  analysis  of  the
governance architecture and the different stages of the policy cycle to identify entry points
where climate change adaptation could be incorporated. At the national level, typical entry
points include various stages in the formulation of national policies, long-term and multi-
year development  plans, sectoral budgetary allocation  processes, as well as regulatory
processes. On the other hand, the entry points would be very different for on-the-ground
projects,  where  climate  change  adaptation  considerations  might  need  to  be  factored
within specific elements of the project cycle.

Information, monitoring and evaluation

It is necessary to collect and provide information on climate hazards, vulnerability,
resilience and adaptive capacity. The establishment of international organisations that
encourage information sharing and exchange is also very important. One example is the
Asia Pacific Adaptation Network (APAN) launched in October 2009 in response to an urgent
need for immediate and adequate actions to adapt to climate change. It is a regional hub of
the Global Climate Change Adaptation Network (GAN). The GAN aims to support countries
to build the climate resilience of vulnerable human systems, ecosystems and economies
through  the  mobilisation  and  sharing  of  knowledge  and  technologies  to  support
adaptation capacity building, policy setting, planning and practices.

With increasing investment in adaptation, one important challenge for the future will
be to establish the right sets of indicators for identifying priorities, as well as monitoring
and  evaluation  frameworks  for  adaptation.  While  progress  on  mitigation  can  be
interpreted from trends in national GHG emissions, comparable measurable outcomes do
not yet exist for adaptation. The difficulties in monitoring and evaluating adaptation range
from the ambiguous definition of adaptation to the identification of targets and the choice
of indicators used to monitor performance. Consequently, while international discussions
on adaptation have focused on implementation of adaptation and the associated costs,
systematic evaluation of how much progress is being made in this direction is generally
lacking and needs further development (Lamhauge et al., 2011).

Getting the policy mix right: Interactions between adaptation and mitigation

In recent years progress has been made in recognising the importance of adapting to
climate change, in understanding climate projections and in assessing climate impacts
and adaptation options. However, there is still a long way to go before the right instruments

108

3. CLIMATE CHANGE

and  institutions  are  in  place  for  adaptation.  In  particular,  improvements  are  needed
in establishing institutional mechanisms and explicitly incorporating climate change risks
in  projects  and  policies.  At  the  national  level  it  is  also  necessary  to  increase  the
understanding of climate change in order to be able to set priorities. Progress is also needed
in increasing private-sector engagement and integrating climate change in development
co-operation.

Both mitigation and adaptation policies are essential and complementary: the near-
term impacts of climate change are already locked-in, thus making adaptation inevitable;
and over the longer term, without mitigation, the magnitude and rate of climate change
will exceed the capacity of natural and social systems to adapt. OECD and other analysis
show  that  the  total  costs  of  climate  change  will  be  lowest  when  both  mitigation  and
adaptation occur together (Agrawala et al., 2010b; de Bruin et al., 2009; IPCC, 2007b).

However, there is a need to find an appropriate balance between short- and long-term
action,  both  for  mitigation  and  adaptation.  Taking  early  action  implies  a  degree  of
irreversibility  and  opportunity  cost,  as,  at  least  hypothetically,  there  is some  value  in
waiting for better information about the severity of climate impacts or availability of new
abatement technologies and many of the investments undertaken are “sunk”, embodied in
long-lived capital stocks and infrastructure. The optimal means and timing of interventions
remains unknown and there is a difficult trade-off between avoiding irreversible policy cost
and avoiding irreversible, and possibly extreme, damages. However, policies can influence
this trade-off (Jamet and Corfee-Morlot, 2009; Weitzman, 2009). 

The sector emphasis of national climate strategies, the balance between mitigation
and adaptation and the mix of policy instruments used to address climate change will vary
among  countries  according  to  national  circumstances,  economic  and  demographic
profiles,  cultural  (and  regulatory)  preferences,  energy  mix,  the  nature  and  size  of  the
market  failures  and  differences  in  institutional  capacities.  Adaptation  and  mitigation
policy strategies may compete for resources in some contexts. However, investing heavily
in one option will undoubtedly reduce the need for investments in the other. Yet unlimited
investments in adaptation do not replace the need for mitigation.

Multilevel  governance  is  increasingly a feature of  national climate mitigation  and
adaptation strategies and plans, where regional and local/city level actions contribute to
overall  national  climate  policy  strategies  (OECD, 2010a).  Given  their  concentration  of
population, economic activities and GHG emissions, cities and local governments have an
important  role  to  play  in  mitigating  and  adapting  to  climate  change  (OECD, 2010a).
However,  aligning  incentives  and  effective  co-ordination  among  different  levels  of
government will help to avoid duplicative or costly policy measures. For example, there is
a danger that measures taken by one city automatically will be counteracted by another
city failing to reduce  emissions,  especially  if total  emissions  across a  certain area are
“capped” (OECD, 2011b). 

4. Policy steps for tomorrow: Building a low-carbon, climate-resilient economy

Having looked at the international and national policy instruments that are currently
in place, this final section outlines what further policies are required for achieving the 2 oC
goal.  To  do  so,  the  section  draws on  a  number  of  different  OECD  Outlook  modelling
scenarios to highlight the feasibility, cost and emission implications of different emission
pathways. It also looks at the implications of less stringent targets and of phasing out fossil

fuel subsidies. The section ends with a discussion of synergies between climate change
policies and other goals.

The Cancún Agreements also indicate the necessity of considering strengthening the
long-term global goal, for example to limit the global average temperature rise to 1.5 oC.
Achieving  this  more  stringent  target  would  require  even  more  significant  and  urgent
mitigation action.  The  UNEP overview  (Box 3.7 and  UNEP, 2010)  could  find  virtually no
integrated assessment model able to identify cost-effective pathways that would have a
medium chance, let alone a likely chance, of reaching this more ambitious goal by the end
of the century. The models used in this Outlook are also not able to simulate the pathways
that would have at least a medium chance of achieving this more ambitious goal. 

Box 3.7. The UNEP Emissions Gap Report

The Copenhagen Accord declared that deep cuts in global emissions are required “so as to
hold the increase in global temperature below 2 oC”. The Accord called for an assessment that
would consider strengthening the long-term goal including “temperature rises of 1.5 oC”. Since
December 2009, many countries have pledged to reduce their emissions or constrain their
growth up to 2020. Some of the pledges have conditions attached, such as the provision of
finance and technology or ambitious action from other countries. For these reasons, it is not
easy to tell what the outcomes will be from these various pledges. UNEP (2010) reviewed the
literature on the assessment of the pledges.

The review shows that emission levels of approximately 44 gigatonnes of CO2 equivalent
(GtCO2e) (with a range of 39-44 GtCO2e) in 2020 would be consistent with a “likely” chance of
limiting global warming to 2 oC (i.e. greater than 66% probability), and for a medium (at least
50%) chance of staying below 2 oC temperature increase, the range is 41-48. The corridor for
emissions for the medium chance is represented in Figure 3.16. Under business-as-usual
projections, i.e. if no pledges were to be implemented, the studies reviewed indicated global
emissions could reach 56 GtCO2e (within a range of 54-60 GtCO2e) in 2020, leaving a gap of
12 GtCO2e for the likely chance (with a range of 10-21).

The report suggests this gap could be reduced substantially by:

■ Countries  implementing  more  ambitious,  conditional  pledges,  such  as  the  provision  of

adequate climate finance and ambitious action from other countries.

■ The  negotiations  adopting  rules  that  avoid  a  net  increase  in  emissions  from  i) “lenient”
accounting rules which allow credit to be given for land use, land-use change and forestry
(LULUCF)  activities  that  would  have  happened  in  any  case  without  further  policy
intervention; and ii) the use of surplus emission units, particularly those that could be carried
over from the current commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol, to meet industrialised
country targets.

■ Avoiding “double counting” of offsets.

If the above policy options were to be implemented, the size of the gap could be reduced to
5 GtCO2e. This is approximately equal to the annual global emissions from all the world’s cars,
buses and transport in 2005 and is also more than half the way towards reaching the 2 oC goal.
More ambitious domestic actions, some of which could be supported by international climate
finance, could close the gap further.

The review has been updated in UNEP (2011c), which revealed that the emissions gap has
somewhat  increased,  not  because  the  pledges  themselves  have  changed,  but  because
business-as-usual emissions projections for 2020 have been revised upwards.

What if …? Three scenarios for stabilising emissions at 450 ppm

Research shows that if the world could stabilise GHG concentrations34 at 450 ppm
CO2e, the chance of keeping the global temperature increase under 2 oC would be between
40% and 60% (Meinshausen et al., 2006; 2009).35 To explore the feasibility and implications
of achieving this target, three different scenarios for stabilising concentrations at 450 ppm
by  the  end  of  the  21st century  have  been  modelled.  Table 3.5 summarises  the  main
characteristics of the three scenarios, as well as a less ambitious 550 ppm scenario for
comparative purposes. Annex 3.A contains further details of the assumptions underlying
these scenarios, while Chapter 1 provides background information on the models used for
the analysis.

The 450 Core pathway assumes full flexibility in the timing of emission reductions and
the use of mitigation options, including biomass energy with CCS known as “BECCS”36
(see also Box 3.13). It further assumes that global co-operation is  achieved for tackling
climate change, and thus the pathway is implemented through a fully harmonised carbon
market that encompasses all  regions, sectors and  gases.  Achieving  this pathway  thus
depends on: i) acting now to put a price on carbon, and immediately tapping into the cheap
mitigation options in all sectors, regions and gases; ii) gradually transforming the energy
system to become a low-carbon sector; and iii) using the large opportunities for low-cost
advanced technologies – including BECCS – that are stimulated by the carbon price. As all
least-cost mitigation options are included in the analysis, this scenario acts as the cost-
effective reference point against which to compare the other scenarios.

The 450 Core scenario assumes that there can be negative emissions in some regions in
the latter half of the century by using BECCS. This allows this pathway to be achieved despite
relatively high emission levels in the first half of the century. However, experience with
bioenergy and CCS technologies is currently limited. Both face challenges related to climate
policy uncertainty, public acceptance, first-of-a-kind technology risks, and high costs relative
to other technologies (especially CCS). Bioenergy can also have harmful side-effects through
indirect land-use change, potentially leading to higher emissions and biodiversity losses.
Thus, uncertainty about the costs and effectiveness of the BECCS technology remains
considerable (Box 3.13). If BECCS turns out not to fulfill its promise of negative emissions, the
world runs the risk of being locked into higher temperature increases. Thus, an optimal

111

3. CLIMATE CHANGE

pathway for the coming decade should balance the long-term climate risks, short-term costs
and mitigation potentials and expectations about technology development. 

By contrast, the 450 Accelerated Action scenario assumes greater mitigation effort in
the first half of the century, and less reliance on unproven emissions technologies (like
BECCS)  in  later  decades.  Additionally,  this  scenario  would  offer  greater  potential  for
achieving  more  ambitious  long-term  temperature  stabilisation  targets,  such  as  1.5 oC,
although opportunities are limited to speed up emission reductions beyond the pathway
shown here.

On the other hand, the 450 Delayed Action scenario starts from the premise that it may
not be realistic to expect large emission reductions in the coming decade.37 It reflects the
current situation in that it models the high end of the pledges made in the Copenhagen
Accord  and  Cancún  Agreements  (with  strict  land-use  accounting  rules  and  no  use  of
surplus  emission credits  from the current  Kyoto  Protocol commitment period).  It  also
assumes that the various domestic carbon markets are not linked to each other until 2020.
If this scenario comes to pass, by 2020, emissions would be outside the 41-48 GtCO2e range
that UNEP (2010) suggests is necessary for least-cost pathways to have at least a medium
chance of limiting  average  global temperature  to 2 oC. The  450 Delayed Action  scenario
assumes that significant additional efforts will have to be made after 2020 to “catch up”
and very rapid rates of emission reduction will be required to give a 50% chance of meeting
the  2 oC  goal.  Postponing  compensation  for  the  higher  short-term  emissions  until
after 2050 would increase the chance of exceeding the temperature limit and increase the
risks of negative environmental consequences caused by a 10% higher annual temperature
increase in the coming decades than under the 450 Core scenario. Moreover, it relies heavily
on i) unlocking the global energy system from its current high-carbon reliance; and ii) the
ability to rapidly transform the energy system later in the century. This goes against the
current trend, in which the world is in fact locking itself into high-carbon systems more
strongly every year (IEA, 2011b). 

Finally, the 550 Core scenario explores what is needed to limit GHG concentrations at
the higher level of 550 ppm by the end of the century. Under this scenario the chance of the
average global temperature increasing beyond 2 oC is much higher, and there is only a
medium  chance of limiting  temperature increase to 2.5 oC-3 oC. Other climate change
impacts are also more severe than in the 450 ppm scenarios. 

Figure 3.16 shows how these different pathways affect the growth of global emission
levels  over  time  and  compares  it  to  the  range  of  pathways  presented  in  UNEP  (2010)
(see Box 3.7).  All  three  450 ppm  scenarios  show  emissions  peaking  before 2020.  The
450 Delayed  Action  scenario  shows  a  short  delay  before  global  emission  levels  start
reducing, implying that after 2025 there would need to be a rapid reversal of current trends
to still achieve the 2 oC target. Note that until 2020, the 450 Delayed Action pathway is
almost identical to the 550 ppm scenario. 

The 2 oC pathways presented in this OECD Environmental Outlook assume an optimal
allocation  of  mitigation  efforts  across  different  sources  and  gases.  These  stylised
optimisation scenarios temporarily allow the targeted concentration level (450 ppm) to be
exceeded  or  overshot  in  the  middle  of  the  century,  before  falling  to  reach  the  target
concentration by the end of the century (Figure 3.17). However, overshooting may have
serious  environmental  impacts  by  causing  higher  rates  of  temperature  change  in  the
coming decades than if action was taken earlier. A more rapidly changing climate and a

greater overshoot  of concentration targets could  have  serious  consequences  for  some
systems that are already under threat at lower levels of change (e.g. coral reefs and possibly
ocean marine systems more broadly; IPCC, 2007a and b; Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2007). In
principle, the delay in temperature response from changes in concentrations implies that
for small changes in emissions – if compensated for within two to three decades – changes
in global climate parameters will be very small (den Elzen and van Vuuren, 2007) and the
scenarios presented here do not result in overshooting the 2 oC goal. 

Figure 3.17 illustrates the projected concentration pathways of the various scenarios,
including all climate forcers.38 It shows that the pathway of the 450 Delayed Action scenario
reflects a larger degree of overshoot than the other two 450 ppm scenarios. The catch-up in
mitigation efforts in the middle of the century implies that concentration levels gradually
fall  back  to  the  pathway  of  the  450 Core  scenario  and  are  nearly  identical  from 2080
onwards. In contrast, the  450 Accelerated Action scenario prevents some of the overshoot
and  has  concentration  levels  peaking  at  less  than  470 ppm.  In  all  three  450 scenarios
concentration  levels  decline  after 2050  to  ensure  that  temperature  increases  do  not
overshoot. Finally, note that the lower mitigation efforts in the coming decade under the
450 Delayed  Action and  550 ppm  scenarios  lead  to  higher  emission  levels  of  aerosols,
especially sulphur. This is because energy use is generally reduced less. The cooling effect
of  these  gases  would  reduce  temperatures  in  the  short  run  compared  to  the  450 Core
scenario, which explains the very similar concentration levels until 2030.

Compared with the “no new policies” Baseline projection, all three 450 ppm scenarios
would have significantly lower climate impacts, and offer at least a medium chance of
limiting global average temperature increase in 2100 to 2 oC.39 Precipitation patterns would
also  change  less  in  the  450 scenarios  than  in  the Baseline  (see Figures 3.10  and 3.11).
However, the mitigation efforts undertaken in the 450 ppm scenarios will not avoid all
climate impacts. Thus, adaptation to remaining impacts will still be required.

The implications of achieving the 450 Core scenario

Figure 3.18 indicates that to achieve the 450 ppm stabilisation target, global emission
reductions  of  12%  will  be  needed  by 2020  and  70%  by 2050  compared  to  the  Baseline
(for 2050 this means 52% below 2005 levels, and 42% below 1990 levels). Emissions would
therefore have to decrease at  an average rate of 1.7% per year  between 2010 and 2050,
compared to the increase of +1.3% projected under the Baseline. Reduced CO2 emissions
from fossil fuel combustion would account for 75% of the global reduction by 2050. For
emissions from land-use change the situation is reversed: the 450 Core scenario would
require  additional land  for  growing bioenergy crops. Thus  there  would be a less  rapid
reduction of emissions from land-use change compared to the Baseline, and lower levels of
net  CO2  uptake  in  the  later  decades  (the  difference  is  1.2 GtCO2e  in 2050).  In  order  to
achieve the 450 ppm target these additional emissions (and reduced uptake) would have to
be compensated for by greater emission reductions by energy and industry.

The scenario assumes that carbon pricing is used to give incentives for mitigation
efforts in all parts of the economy. A relatively large portion of emission reductions could
be achieved relatively cheaply and quickly by limiting emissions of non-CO2 gases from
industries (e.g. coal mining, oil and gas processing and shipping, acid production) and the
agricultural  sector  (e.g. changing  rice  cultivation  patterns  and  nutrient  management);
and  improving  waste  handling  (waste  recycling  and  methane  capture  from  landfills).
Curbing global emissions beyond 2020 would require a rapidly increasing carbon price (to
USD 325/tCO2e in 2050) to discourage intensive reliance on carbon-based energy sources.
Only a strong and lasting carbon price signal will achieve the major transition required in
carbon-intensive sectors, and those with large-scale infrastructural investments.

This scenario implies that world GDP growth would slow down between 2010 and 2050 as
a result of lower energy consumption and the shift in supply options driven by higher energy
prices. The average growth rate decreases from 3.5% per year in the Baseline to 3.3% per year in
the 450 ppm Core scenario, giving a world GDP that is 5.5% lower in 2050 than under the Baseline

scenario. However, it should be stressed that a major limitation of all the results presented here
(Box 3.8) is that they do not factor in any benefits of the mitigation action (see Chapter 2 on the
cost of inaction and Chapter 3, Section 4 for synergies with other environmental issues). The
economic impacts therefore reflect purely the cost of action, not the net costs or benefits.

Energy use grows between 2010 and 2020 in both the Baseline projection and the 450 Core
scenario (although at a slower pace in the latter). After 2020, emissions would be reduced
primarily by energy-efficiency improvements and strong supply changes. The ENV-Linkages
simulations  find that  energy-efficiency  improvements are the main driver (especially
producers  substituting more expensive energy with  labour and  capital,  such  as more
expensive but energy-efficient machines), leading to a sharp drop in emissions by 2050.40 A

vast decarbonisation is required in the power generation and transport sector, as well as
replacing existing dirty energy use by consumers (e.g. use of cooking fuels) with more efficient
electricity-based technologies. This all involves a drastic restructuring of the energy sector. 

Box 3.8. Cost uncertainties and modelling frameworks

Apart from uncertainties about climate and emission reduction timing, there are also
significant uncertainties surrounding the costs of implementing climate change policies.
The  variations  in  the  cost  estimates  across  different  modelling  frameworks  reflect
fundamental uncertainties about the availability of technological options and their costs
and development over time, as well as assumptions about economic growth, treatment of
options  that  could  have negative  net  costs  (such  as  energy  savings)  and  other model
characteristics.  For  example,  the  ENV-Linkages  model  assumes  a  higher  mitigation
potential for non-CO2 GHGs at moderate cost than the IMAGE model suite. Consequently,
the 450 Core scenario in ENV-Linkages leads to substantially lower carbon prices by 2020
than IMAGE (USD 10/tCO2e versus USD 50/tCO2e).

While results presented here  only come from the  ENV-Linkages and IMAGE models,
these belong to a large family of models designed to study climate change policy. Modelling
comparison  exercises  have  been  conducted  to  better  understand  the  influence  of
modelling frameworks on the results, as well as to identify the range of cost estimates
(see Edenhofer  et al., 2009 and 2010;  Clarke  et al.,  2009;  and  van  Vuuren  et al.,  2009).  A
450 ppm pathway would lead to a reduction of GDP in 2050 of either 5%-6% (ENV-Linkages)
or 4% (IMAGE). These results fall within the range of estimates found in Luderer et al.
(2009), which vary from about –0.5% to 6.5% (in 2060), and are similar to cost estimates
for 2050 cited in IPCC (2007c). As emphasised by Tavoni and Tol (2010) such ranges should
be assessed with care, because they usually exclude models which are unable to meet the
target.  Within  the  range,  larger  mitigation  costs  can  for  instance  be  caused  by  more
conservative  assumptions  on  substitution  across  production  factors  and  energy
technologies  or  by  the  limited  availability  of  advanced  technologies  in  the  models
(Edenhofer et al., 2010). The low end of the range usually corresponds to models with a
wide technology portfolio and optimistic assumptions about technological advances.

The costs shown in Figure 3.18 result from a regional permit allocation rule where
regional  emission  allowances  evolve  over  time  towards  equal  per-capita  allowances
(Box 3.9). This so-called “contraction and convergence” allocation rule is not meant as a
policy  recommendation,  but  is  used  here  purely  for  illustrative  purposes.  Alternative
permit allocation rules lead to similar global costs, at least when full permit trading is
allowed, but the allocation of these costs across the regions can vary significantly. 

When allowing full emission permit trading, GHG emission reduction pathways are
similar across all regions (ranging from 67% to 71% reduction by 2050 compared to the
Baseline), as the stringency of the 450 Core target calls for action in all regions. Nonetheless,
mitigation  strategies  will  differ depending on the level  of  economic development  and
growth perspectives. Switching rapidly to low-carbon technologies allows OECD economies
to be partially decarbonised, while energy-efficiency measures are the main mitigation
option in BRIICS countries.41 Energy intensity, defined as the ratio of energy use to GDP, is
projected to decrease by 3.2% annually in OECD countries (close to the world average),
while this ratio will reach 3.9% and 4.5% per year in BRIICS and RoW countries respectively.

Box 3.9. What if… the mitigation burden was shared differently? 

How permit allocation rules matter

In  a  global  cap-and-trade  system  (as  assumed  in  the  450 Core  scenario),  emission  allowances  are
allocated to individual countries. As illustrated in Figure 3.19, determining regional emission allowances
could be an effective step in shifting part of the burden of mitigation costs from developing economies to
OECD  countries.  All  the  cases  presented  here  assume  that  countries  can  auction  their  domestically
allocated permits, with the revenues redistributed to households as a lump sum. The international burden
sharing regime is thus primarily aimed at distributing costs among countries, not between individual
polluters. Also, it is assumed that full international trading of permits is allowed. Essentially, this separates
the place where mitigation action takes place from where the economic burden falls. Unless transaction
costs are prohibitive, these permit allocation rules are a very powerful mechanism for ensuring that least-
cost options are taken.

The following different permit allocation rules, which all have the same global emission pathway as the

450 Core scenario, are considered here:1
■ The 450 Core scenario: assumes a “contraction and convergence” rule, where the allocation of emission
permits across regions is based on a gradual convergence from actual (2010) levels of emissions to equal
emission  allowances  per  capita  by 2050  in  all  countries;  this  is  effectively  a  transition  from  a
grandfathering rule to a per-capita rule. Alternative convergence criteria or convergence dates are also
conceivable. 

■ The Grandfathering2 scenario: assumes that every year countries will receive the same share in global

allowances, based on actual (2010) emissions.

■ The Per-capita scenario: assumes that countries will receive a share in global allowances based on the

projected levels of population, i.e. per-capita emission allowances are equal across countries.

■ The  Global  carbon  tax  scenario:  assumes  a  carbon  tax  is  implemented  globally;  this  is  equivalent  to a
permit allocation where emission allowances are allocated such that marginal costs are equal across
regions, and so there is no permit trading.

As GDP is a poor indicator of the welfare impacts of policies when large volumes of emission permit

trading occur, these allocation schemes should be compared using equivalent variation in real income.3

Box 3.9. What if… the mitigation burden was shared differently? 

How permit allocation rules matter (cont.)

Globally, the allocation schemes do not matter much for income levels, as they all constrain global
emissions at identical levels (Figure 3.19) and allow emissions trading. Regional differences are quite
pronounced, however, largely mimicking the differences in emission allowances. Under the Per-capita
scenario, poor and populated regions like India and developing countries (rest of the world group or
RoW) would become large permit exporters, and the trade in allocations would reduce costs in these
regions. Most OECD countries have the lowest income losses under the Grandfathering scenario. Russia
and China would also be better off in a grandfathering allocation scheme (given their high current
emission intensities),  although income losses in these  regions would  be above global  levels  in all
schemes.

1. More details on the shares of regions in the permit allocation scheme are given in Annex 3.A.
2. “Grandfathering” uses a company, sector or country’s historical emissions levels to set their future permit allowances.
3. The equivalent real income variation is defined as the change in real income (in %) necessary to ensure the same level of
utility to consumers as in the Baseline projection. One problem with using real GDP changes is that permit trades are not
valued (see OECD, 2009b for more details). It is also important to note that permit transfers across countries would change
international trade patterns and put pressure on exchange rates, i.e. the terms of trade across countries would be affected.
For this reason real household income could be more affected by the allocation than GDP levels (OECD, 2009b).

There is more potential for improvement in energy efficiency in these regions as their
carbon intensity is on average higher than in OECD countries (IEA, 2009b).42

Given the “contraction and convergence” distribution of emission permits under the
450 Core scenario, the OECD region is the main buyer of permits, implying that they achieve
part of their required emission reductions abroad. The developing countries in the RoW
group are the main suppliers of permits. The related costs to the economies vary more
widely  among  regions.  The  relatively  high  GDP  losses  in  the  BRIICS  are  largely
concentrated in i) Russia – which is negatively affected by the reduced demand for fossil
fuels; and ii) China, where emission growth is much more rapid than population growth,
implying  that  in  the  later  decades  China  would  have  to  buy  substantial  amounts  of
emission permits on the international market.

Using an appropriate system for allocating revenues from market-based mitigation
policies domestically could reduce the economic costs of mitigation. For example, using
carbon tax or  permit  revenues to lower  labour taxes could  stimulate employment and
would reduce the cost of mitigation in the short term (e.g. see Chateau et al., 2011). In the
long run, however, when labour markets are more flexible, the scope for such a “double
dividend” would be less. 

The implications of achieving the 450 Accelerated Action scenario

Both the 450 Accelerated Action and the 450 Core scenarios reduce the projected Baseline
emissions by more than 75% by 2050. The main difference between the two scenarios is the
timing of global mitigation efforts in the next two decades. These result in differences in
which gases are reduced most (or which fuel in the case of energy-related CO2 emissions),
as well as different regional and sectoral mitigation choices. These elements are illustrated
in the four panels of Figure 3.20. Of course, the larger mitigation efforts in the 450 Accelerated
Action scenario  imply  lower  environmental  risks  but  higher  costs  than  the  450 Core
scenario. By 2030 carbon prices would be about 50% higher in the  450 Accelerated Action
scenario than in the 450 Core.

3. CLIMATE CHANGE

In aggregate terms, both scenarios lead to very similar emission reduction patterns
across regions, given the shared permit allocation rule. BRIICS countries account for about
half of the total mitigation effort, the other half being split evenly between OECD and RoW
countries.  However,  the  analysis  of  country  details  reveals  larger  differences  across
scenarios: China and the Middle East account respectively for about one-third and 7% of
total  mitigation  in  the  450 Accelerated  Action  scenario,  and  are  more  sensitive  to  the
targeted emission level in 2020. In other countries, such as India, mitigation efforts depend
less on the scenario architecture because the mitigation potentials in these countries are
less sensitive to the carbon price level around the years 2020 and 2030.

In both simulations, the lowest  cost  mitigation options are  mobilised in the early
stages  of  action,  irrespective  of  the  carbon  price  level.  The  level  of  ambition  then
determines  the  optimal  mix of  reduction measures.  Non-CO2 GHGs  (methane,  nitrous
oxide and fluorinated or “F gases”, such as HFCs, PFCs and sulphur hexafluoride – SF6) have
sizeable  mitigation  potential and  reductions  can  be  achieved  at moderate  cost. These
potentials  could  be tapped  into  even  under modest  carbon  prices. For  example,  easily
adjusted industrial activities and changes in agricultural practices are projected to help
reduce large volumes of methane efficiently (e.g. in coal mining, oil and gas processing and
shipping; waste recycling and methane capture from landfills). Methane mitigation alone
accounts for more than 60% of the total reduction of non-CO2 gases by 2020. The reduction
of  nitrous  oxide  arising  from  changes  in  rice  cultivation  patterns,  acid  production  or
nutrient management, covers another 20%.

Accelerated action would require a quicker decarbonisation of electricity production,
while a more gradual response to climate change would require relatively more effort from
energy intensive industries, services and agriculture. In both scenarios, oil is the fossil fuel
affected the most over the coming decade. Coal use is particularly discouraged for power
generation  and  even  moderate  carbon  prices  are  enough  to  trigger  efficiency
improvements in coal-based electricity generation and to favour a switch towards gas-
based  production  capacity  that  is  less  carbon-intensive,  notably  in  China  and  India.
Natural gas is affected evenly in both scenarios and represents about 20% of total reduction
in 2020  and 2030.  In  both  scenarios,  gas  acts  as  a  bridging  fuel  until  lower  carbon
technologies  become  available  on  a  large  scale.  Nuclear  energy  is  projected  to  supply
almost two-thirds of low-carbon electricity in 2020 and only half of it by 2030 in both cases.
The share of hydro electricity tends to diminish over time as wind, solar and other non-
hydro  renewables  take  over.  However,  the  carbon  price  differential  between  the  two
scenarios  is  not  significant  enough  to  drive  notable  changes  in  the  mix  of  renewable
technologies  by 2030.  Finally,  fossil  fuel  based  electricity  generation  with  CCS  plays  a
significant  role  later  in  the  projection  period  (see Box 3.10 on  the  implications  of
technology options).

The implications of achieving the 450 Delayed Action scenario

As  discussed  above,  the  450 Delayed  Action  scenario  assumes  that  until 2020
mitigation  efforts  will  aim  to  achieve  the  high  end  of  the  pledges  made  in  the
Copenhagen  Accord  and  Cancún  Agreements  (Table 3.6).  A  large  number  of  countries
have  submitted  reduction  targets  or  national  mitigation  plans  as  part  of  the 2009
Copenhagen  Accord  –  these  were  subsequently  incorporated  into  the 2010  UNFCCC
Cancún  Agreements.  Almost  all developed countries have pledged to meet quantified

Box 3.10. Implications of technology options 

Many  different  pathways  are  possible for  achieving  a  given mitigation  target.  The policy  scenarios
investigated  in  this  Outlook model different technology  pathways  to reduce  emissions. In the  Baseline
scenario the power sector globally accounts for more than 40% of CO2 emissions in 2050, and therefore
plays a key role in the decarbonisation of the economy. To explore the role of energy technologies under the
450 Accelerated  Action  scenario, three  alternative  simulations were  conducted using the  ENV-Linkages
model (for more details see Annex 3.A). These scenarios all aim at achieving the same 450 ppm emission
pathway, with the same timing of emission reductions but assume different patterns of technological
developments to achieve it: 

i)

ii)

Low efficiency and renewables: assumes lower efficiency improvements in energy use compared to the
default assumptions in the 450 Accelerated Action scenario, through less improvement of energy inputs
in production, and slower increases in production of renewables. 

Progressive nuclear phase-out: assumes that nuclear capacity currently under construction and planned
until 2020 will be built and connected to the grid. However, after 2020, no new nuclear unit will be built
so that the world total capacity by 2050 will be reduced because of the natural retirement of existing
plants.

iii) No CCS: assumes no greater use of CCS technologies beyond the levels projected in the Baseline. 

In the short run – to 2020 – altering the set of mitigation technologies results in only limited changes in
the electricity generation mix and level because the carbon penalty is too low to overcome the inertia in the
energy system. In all simulations the bulk of emission reduction over this timeframe is therefore achieved
by decreasing emissions of methane, nitrous oxide and F gases, although there is also some reduction in
energy consumption induced by the carbon price. 

However, the role of these energy technologies in the longer run – to 2050 – is more pronounced as low-
carbon technologies are projected to have taken over in all regions of the world (Figure 3.21). Panel A
illustrates GDP impacts and carbon prices for each scenario, while Panel B shows the electricity generation
mix and the overall production level for each of the three macro-regions. What becomes clear from Panel A
is  that  having  sufficient  flexibility  in  the  energy  system  will  protect  regions  against  large,  sudden,
unexpected  increases  in  cost,  or  reduced  availability  of  a  specific  technology  at  the  scale  originally
anticipated.*

By 2050, when all technologies are assumed to be available, renewable electricity is assumed to supply
about half of the needs in OECD and BRIICS, which will also rely on capital-intensive nuclear and fossil fuel
plants with CCS. The results reveal strong complementarities between nuclear and fossil fuels (with or
without CCS) in most regions. Phasing out nuclear facilities in the BRIICS countries, where most new
capacity  is  expected  to  be  built  in  the  coming  decades,  causes  a  substantial  reduction  in  electricity
generation. Power plants with CCS become competitive around 2030 and increasingly so by the end of the
time horizon in both OECD and BRIICS. In the absence of CCS power plants by 2050, switching to more
expensive technologies increases electricity prices  and alters consumption patterns. Fossil fuel power
plants without CCS are projected to decline to about 10% of total power supply worldwide, due to the high
carbon price, unless nuclear is phased out, in which case such a steep decline is not feasible. 

The RoW region is projected to follow a different mitigation strategy, predominantly relying on increasing
renewable  energy  sources.  This  region  is  therefore  very  sensitive  to  the  assumptions  about  energy
efficiency and productivity of renewable energy technologies, but less affected by the exclusion of nuclear
and CCS. Given this projected strategy, substituting away from renewable energy sources is more difficult
and costly. In turn, corresponding income losses in the RoW region are more than doubled in the  low
efficiency and renewables scenario compared to the 450 Accelerated Action scenario.

* The 2011 incident at the Fukushima nuclear plant in Japan and the following reconsideration of nuclear energy use in other

countries was a harsh reminder that possible large-scale disruptions to the energy system cannot be ignored.

Although up until 2020 the emission reductions in the 450 Delayed Action scenario are
smaller than in the 450 Core scenario, real income losses are larger for most regions, because
of the fragmentation of the carbon market (Figure 3.22). Carbon prices vary between regions
in Delayed Action, ranging from zero for regions that do not have a binding pledge (including
the Middle East and North Africa and rest of the world countries) to more than USD 50/tCO2e
for the combined Japan and Korea region. These results depend on a number of crucial but
uncertain assumptions about the interpretation of the pledges (Box 3.11).

Box 3.11. Mind the gap: Will the Copenhagen pledges deliver enough?

The Copenhagen pledges reflected in the 450 Delayed Action scenario would not be enough to achieve the
450 ppm pathway in a cost-effective way. This is confirmed by other analysis, which shows that these pledges
fall short of UNEP’s (2010) cost-effective range of 41-48 GtCO2e for global GHG emissions in 2020 (see
Box 3.8 above). These are the maximum emissions allowed to give the world a medium to likely chance of
meeting the 2 oC target at least cost (Dellink et al., 2010; UNEP, 2010). Table 3.7 confirms this: global emissions
in 2020 would amount to 51.6 GtCO2e for the high pledges and above 52 GtCO2e for the low pledges (but
including the conditional pledges).1 The gap between the emission reductions in the 450 Delayed Action scenario
and the pathway consistent with 2 oC is thus between 3 and 11 GtCO2e (whereas total mitigation efforts in
450 Delayed Action in 2020 amount to less than 4 GtCO2e).2 As argued in UNEP (2010) and confirmed by our
analysis (see next section), it is virtually impossible to identify what temperature increases these pledges
to 2020 would lead to, as the assumptions about the pathway after 2020 will largely affect the resulting
temperature changes.

Combining the lower end of the pledges with LULUCF accounting rules3 that result in credits that are not
induced by a change in management activities and use of surplus Assigned Amounts Units (AAUs)4 from the
current Kyoto commitment period (2008-2012) could widen this gap even further. There are other uncertainties
that have less effect on environmental effectiveness, but do affect costs. They include limitations on the use of
offsets, international financing of mitigation action in developing countries and linking of carbon markets in
Annex I countries. Table 3.7 shows how these uncertainties affect global emissions (in GtCO2e) and regional
costs (in real income deviation from Baseline).

Both the high and low pledge levels show limited overall costs, although for some regions and sectors the
costs are somewhat higher (see Figure 3.22). Costs increase in the OECD Annex I countries especially when
they  abstain  from  using  land-use  credits  and/or  offsets.  Costs  can  be  reduced  in  these  countries  by
adopting lower pledges, linking carbon markets or  allowing surplus AAUs; however, in all cases these
reductions come at the cost of higher global emissions. International financing above and beyond participation
in the offset mechanism can reduce the costs for developing countries. However, the effect is limited as the
simulations  assume that  only  Brazil, Mexico  and  South  Africa qualify  for these  international  funds
(see Annex 3.A; and note that the other non-Annex I countries are eligible as offset hosts). Russia and the Rest

of Europe region (incl. Ukraine) benefit most from linking carbon markets, as they have large amounts of
permits to sell. Finally, note that for the “rest of the world” countries costs can be limited by either allowing
more offsets or linking carbon markets in the Annex I countries. Both options lead to price harmonisation
across the Annex I countries and limit negative spill-over effects through a global contraction of international
trade.

The use of market-based instruments, such as carbon taxes or cap-and-trade with auctioned emission
permits, can provide a source of fiscal revenue. If the Cancún Agreements/Copenhagen Accord pledges and
actions for Annex I countries as described above were to be implemented as a carbon tax or a cap-and-trade
with fully auctioned permits, in 2020 the fiscal revenues would amount to more than USD 250 billion, i.e. 0.6%
of their GDP.5 Although there would be many competing uses of such revenue, just a fraction of this amount
would make a significant contribution to climate change financing specified in the Cancún Agreements.6
1. Some countries made both unconditional (less ambitious) and conditional (more ambitious) pledges. These latter would be
honoured if the conditions they attached to the pledges were fulfilled, for example providing adequate climate finance and
ambitious action from other countries.

2. These numbers differ from Dellink et al. (2010) because the analysis here is based on the methodology of Den Elzen et al. (2011)
and includes emissions from land use, land-use change and forestry, not because the pledges themselves have substantially
changed.

3. Accounting  rules  for  land  use,  land-use  change  and  forestry  (LULUCF)  can  potentially  weaken  the  mitigation  targets  of
industrialised countries. This could occur if credit is given for LULUCF activities that would have happened in any case without
further policy intervention.

4. An Assigned Amount Unit (AAU) is a tradable “Kyoto unit” or carbon credit representing an allowance to emit one tonne of
GHGs. Assigned Amount Units are issued up to the level of the initial “assigned amount” of an Annex I Party to the Kyoto
Protocol. See Annex 3.A for more.

5. These numbers are lower than in Dellink et al. (2010) primarily because the use of LULUCF credits lowers the carbon price and

6.

because costs are expressed here in constant 2010 USD, not because the pledges themselves have changed.
In  the  simulations  presented  here  the  revenues  are  redistributed  to  households  in  a  lump  sum  manner  and  alternative
destinations would affect this lump sum transfer and, indirectly, the economy.

As  the  450 Delayed  Action  scenario  assumes  that  until  2020  international  permit
trading is not allowed, many low-cost mitigation options remain unexploited until 2020,
driving up global costs. Figure 3.22 clearly illustrates that domestic policies are not the
only, and sometimes not even the main, determinant of the macroeconomic costs of the
policies. Fossil fuel exporters, such as Russia and the Middle East region, are projected to
have higher income losses, despite having hardly or no costs from domestic mitigation
efforts. Panel A of Figure 3.22 also shows how international financing of mitigation action
(assumed to take place in South Africa, Brazil and Mexico, see Annex 3.A) can help to limit
the costs of domestic action. Combined with the opportunity to sell credits on the offset
market, the “Rest of BRIICS” group have only very small income losses in the 450 Delayed
Action scenario.

In the longer run (2050), the 450 Delayed Action scenario requires  more ambitious
mitigation efforts to bring concentration levels back down to the 450 ppm target before the end
of the century. As these efforts occur later than in the 450 Core scenario, it is not surprising that
income losses are again higher in the 450 Delayed Action scenario (Figure 3.22, Panel B). By 2050
in both the 450 Core and Delayed Action scenarios a global carbon market has formed with
permit allocations based on population; thus the larger income losses reflect the additional
costs resulting from inadequate mitigation efforts in the earlier decades. There is both a direct
effect  –  stemming  from  the  increased  mitigation  efforts  required  in 2050  to  limit
concentrations – and an indirect effect from the lack of structural reform in the energy sector
in the earlier decades.

Table 3.8 shows how competitiveness is likely to be affected by the 450 Delayed Action
mitigation policy. Not surprisingly, energy producers including power plants are projected
to reduce their output and export levels following reduced demand due to carbon pricing.
Given the low trade exposure of power plants, however, the energy sector is less vulnerable
from a competitiveness perspective than energy-intensive industries. The relatively low
emission-intensity of energy-intensive industry in OECD countries implies that while they
would be faced with substantial cost increases due to the mitigation policy, in the long run,
they can gain market share at the expense of less efficient competitors in the BRIICS and
RoW, and thereby even increase their output levels compared to the Baseline scenario. More
detailed analysis at the sub-sectoral level could identify more precisely where the largest
effects are.

The fragmented carbon markets in the 450 Delayed Action scenario also lead to some
carbon leakage. Table 3.6 shows that as all the largest emitting countries have pledged
reductions  that  effectively  cap  their  emission  levels,  leakage  rates  will  be  rather  low.
In 2020, global leakage is projected to be around 50 MtCO2e, or 1% of total mitigation action
by the countries with pledges. The leakage rates found in the literature for the high end of
the Copenhagen pledges vary widely, from no or very low leakage (e.g. McKibbin et al., 2011)
to  13%  (547 MtCO2e)  in  Peterson  et al.  (2011)  and  16%  in  Bollen  et al.  (2011).  Two  key
differences appear to influence the leakage assessment: i) to what extent binding targets
are included for non-Annex I countries (as these limit the scope for leakage to occur); and
ii) price responsiveness of fossil fuel supply. A price-elastic fuel supply implies that the
reduced fuel price leads to smaller global supply and hence less leakage through the fossil
fuel channel (see Burniaux and Oliveira-Martins, 2000).

3. CLIMATE CHANGE

To  counter  negative  leakage  and  competitiveness  impacts,  governments  have
considered exempting firms or industries at risk, or providing financial compensation,
e.g. through  free  distribution  of  permits  or  output-based  rebates,  or  border  tax
adjustments. However, while temporary use of some target measures may be a way to ease
the transition to a low-carbon economy, these measures should be carefully reviewed in
terms of their economic efficiency, the (dis)incentives they create for GHG reductions and
their impacts on developing countries (OECD, 2010d; Agrawala et al., 2010a). In addition,
they have also been shown to reduce the rate of innovation among firms (OECD, 2010e),
and the benefits of these schemes will decline with the increase in the number of countries
implementing mitigation policies (OECD, 2009b; Burniaux et al., 2010). Instead, multilateral
policy co-ordination would be an efficient alternative to unilateral measures. This was
demonstrated by the UNECE Convention on long-range transboundary air pollution, where
the transfer of knowledge and technologies was greater among signatories (OECD, 2011e).

Less stringent climate mitigation (550 ppm) scenarios

Achieving the 450 ppm scenarios requires global emission levels to peak before or
around 2020. This is only possible if emissions can be reduced in nearly all global regions
and if action starts now. If not, as suggested by the 450 Delayed Action scenario, emissions
in 2020 may be too high to achieve the 2 oC/450 ppm goal cost-effectively. If the 450 ppm
target  is  to  be  reached,  unprecedented  rates  of  emission  reductions  will  be  required
after 2020. The only way to do this will be to drastically transform the high-carbon energy
system into which the world is becoming more tightly locked every year (IEA, 2011b). Given
the uncertainties surrounding our ability to achieve this, less stringent long-run targets
should also be investigated. Up until 2020, the 450 Delayed Action scenario is very close to a
550 Core  scenario,  which  would  require  less  mitigation  in  the  rest  of  the  century  (see
Figure 3.17 above).  However,  the  550 ppm Core  scenario  represents  a  much  greater
likelihood of a global average temperature rise above 2 oC. This implies that unless the
required rapid transformation occurs after 2020, the Copenhagen pledges are more likely
to lead to a 2.5 oC to 3 oC increase in global average temperature than 2 oC. 

If the 550 Core pathway is followed this would imply a trade-off between lower short-term
mitigation costs and higher long-term costs from more serious climate impacts and the need
for higher levels of adaptation than the 450 Delayed Action scenario.45 Once the “low-hanging
fruit” (cheap mitigation options) have been exhausted, the marginal abatement cost of
mitigation actions rises significantly.46 The 550 Core scenario requires that emissions in 2050
are down to 2010 levels (Figure 3.23). It leads to a decline in global real income of 1.3% as
shown in Figure 3.24. Achieving the additional 28 GtCO2e reduction necessary to reach the
450 Delayed  Action  pathway would lead to an  additional  real  income  decline  of  about
8 percentage-points, and global emissions would be 60% below 2010 levels.47

Actions needed for an ambitious, global climate policy framework

The first and best solution to address the competitiveness concerns described above
would be a global, comprehensive and ambitious climate policy framework that creates a level
playing field, covering all sectors and all GHGs (Agrawala et al., 2010a). Broadening the scope of
mitigation action also reduces the related problem of carbon leakage – when mitigation policy
in  one  country  leads  to  increased  emissions  in  other  countries,  thereby  eroding  the
environmental effectiveness of the policy. Leakage can occur through a shift in economic
activity towards unregulated countries, or through increased fossil energy use in unregulated

countries as a result of lower international fuel prices in response to the reduced energy
demand in mitigating countries.

As long as countries take such varied approaches to carbon markets, concerns about
leakage and international competitiveness will remain a significant stumbling block to
ambitious climate change action in many OECD countries (Box 3.12). In evaluating the
potential competitiveness impacts, governments may be most concerned about emission
leakage and conserving output and employment, whereas energy-intensive industries are
more likely to be concerned about profits and market share. In fact, competitiveness impacts
of climate policies are likely to be limited to a small number of sectors representing a small
share of total economic activity, i.e. trade-exposed, energy-intensive industries (including

Box 3.12. What if... a global carbon market does not emerge?

Since reaching the 450 ppm target would require the combined effort of all countries, this box analyses the
impact of market fragmentation under the 550 Core scenario. Linking carbon markets in only some regions
will have a number of inefficiencies. These are illustrated in Figure 3.25 using alternative scenarios. The
different variations modelled are as follows:

550 No linking: unilateral actions only and no linking at all;

550 OECD linking: regional linking within subsets of OECD countries;

550 Annex I linking: linking within Annex I countries only;

550 OECD-BRIICS linking: linking within OECD and BRIICS countries only;

550 Full linking: this is the 550 Core scenario. 

The overarching conclusion from these simulations is that linking markets can help limit the costs of
mitigation policies for participating countries, but it matters drastically which countries link their ETS
systems. Countries that rely mostly on renewable energy sources for electricity generation, and that are
therefore more difficult to decarbonise, tend to benefit most from market linking. Linking has only minor
effects on countries that are not directly involved in the linked schemes, although they do benefit from the
more efficient carbon market through increases in international trade.

OECD countries are projected to be the main permit buyers. Mitigation in OECD countries represents about
a third of global efforts when permit exchange is restricted to Annex I countries and has very limited effects
on macroeconomic costs. Opening trade further to include the rest of the BRIICS implies that China and
India become the major suppliers of permits (similar to the current CDM), decreasing the OECD contribution
by 8 percentage-points of global mitigation levels. Full trading further reduces the contribution of the OECD
countries to 22% of the global effort. 

By 2050, mitigation in the RoW countries would represent 25% of total emission reductions in the 550 Core
(Full linking) scenario. This falls to about 10% if their carbon market is not internationally linked. Allowing the
RoW countries to sell large volumes of emission permits would be a significant and low-cost mitigation
option,  and would  also  earn  them  sizeable  revenues  from  internationally  sold  permits. For  a  detailed
discussion of the potential and risks of linking ETSs, see OECD (2009b).

chemicals, non-ferrous metals, fabricated metal products, iron and steel, pulp and paper, and
non-metallic mineral products).

The patchwork of climate policies across the globe today entails higher compliance costs
in  some  countries  than  others,  and  raises  concerns  in  some  countries  about  the
competitiveness of their energy- and/or carbon-intensive industries at the international level.
These in turn often delay action or discourage more ambitious action. The cheapest policy
response to climate change would be to set a global carbon price – this would require linking
the various ETSs that are emerging locally. Linking generally allows polluters to purchase
credits from a larger set of suppliers. Access to cheaper mitigation options lowers costs by
reducing domestic efforts for permit buyers; polluters with relatively cheap mitigation options
can gain from increasing domestic reduction efforts and selling these on the international
market.

Reforming fossil fuels support

Reforming environmentally harmful subsidies, and specifically fossil fuel subsidies, is
an important step in “getting the prices right” to reduce GHG emissions. An inventory of
24 OECD countries finds that fossil fuel production and use was supported by USD 45-75
billion per year between 2005 and 2010 (OECD, 2011f). Fossil fuel consumption subsidies in
37 developing and emerging economies amounted to an estimated USD 554 billion in 2008,
USD 300 billion in 2009 and USD 409 billion in 2010 (IEA/OECD/OPEC/WB, 2010; IEA, 2011b
and see Annex 3.A at the end of this chapter).48

Removing these subsidies would lower the global cost of stabilising GHG concentrations,
saving money for governments and taxpayers. It helps to shift the economy away from
activities that emit CO2, encourages energy efficiency, and promotes the development and
diffusion  of  low-carbon  technologies  and  renewable  energy  sources.  OECD  Outlook
simulations  using  IEA  data  (2008 estimates)  indicate  that  phasing-out  fossil  fuel
consumption subsidies in emerging and developing countries could reduce global GHG
emissions (excluding land-use change emissions) by 6% globally by 2050, compared with
business as usual, and by over 20% in Russia and Middle East and North Africa countries
(Figure 3.26). As subsidies artificially reduce the price paid by final consumers, removing
this price-wedge would influence behaviour and reduce final energy demand. This could
increase global real income by 0.3% in 2050, and would be especially beneficial for the
BRIICS countries (+1.1% for the Rest of BRIICS category). 

However, some trade effects offset the pure economic efficiency gains of these subsidy
reforms for the main fossil fuel exporting countries (e.g. Russia and the Middle East). This
is because a lower demand for fossil fuels in the reforming countries will cause a decrease
in global energy prices. Moreover, unless OECD countries cap their total emission levels,
this decrease in international prices could create an increase in emissions in some OECD
countries  (relative  to Baseline),  leading  to  a  partial  offset  of  the  original  reduction  of
demand and GHG emissions. Despite this leakage effect, the net effect on global emissions
is, however, projected to be positive. 

If fossil fuel subsidy phase-out is included in the 450 Core scenario, the cost of mitigation
would be lower than in the 450 Core scenario without the subsidy reform. These lower costs
would occur first and foremost in the countries undertaking the subsidy reform, but also at the
global level (Table 3.9). Note that the high costs for the rest of world in 2020 – both for fossil fuel
subsidy reform on its own and a 450 Core scenario that includes fossil fuel subsidy reform – are

due to the impacts on oil-exporting countries in the Middle East. The income gains of the
reform are smaller in the 450 Core scenario than under a framework involving only fossil fuels
subsidy reform. This is because fossil-energy use is lower in the 450 Core scenario and thus the
savings from removing fuel subsidies are also lower.

However, removing these subsidies can be politically challenging, and may also lead to
more use of traditional bioenergy (e.g. cooking using wood or animal manure) in developing
countries,  with  potentially  negative  health  effects  (see Chapter 6).  The  combustion  of
traditional  bioenergy  is  also  associated  with  high  black  carbon  emissions  that  also
contribute to climate change (see Box 3.14 below). As a result, fossil fuel subsidy reforms
should be implemented carefully to ensure that potential negative impacts on household
affordability and well-being are reduced through appropriate measures (e.g. means-tested
social safety net programmes).

3. CLIMATE CHANGE

Finding synergies among climate change strategies and other goals 

Designing policies which address two or more goals at once (environmental, social and
economic) can help to multiply the benefits of policy action. This final section explores
some opportunities for maximising the benefits of combining climate change action with
biodiversity protection, health and green growth.

Climate change, biodiversity and bioenergy

Climate change is projected to play the driving role in further biodiversity loss in the
future (Chapter 4). The right strategies for mitigating climate change will therefore also
have  benefits  for  biodiversity,  slowing  down  the  pace  of  species  loss.  However,  some
climate mitigation policies can have negative impacts on biodiversity. For example, the use
of bioenergy can be an attractive option – its use can reduce GHG emissions and it can be
easily applied as an alternative to liquid fuels in transport (especially for specific purposes
such as aviation and freight transport), in power generation or even to create negative
emissions (if combined with CCS). But it also may have negative impacts on direct and
indirect GHG emissions, and on biodiversity via the need for additional land for biofuel
crops  (Box 3.13).  On  the  other  hand,  other  mitigation  strategies,  such  as  REDD-plus
measures, avoided emissions from land-use changes in forested areas, or the use of second
generation  bioenergy would  result  in additional  biodiversity  co-benefits (Chapter 4 on
biodiversity presents some more policy simulations on this issue).

Box 3.13. Bioenergy: Panacea or Pandora’s Box?

Bioenergy is energy generated from food crops such as grains, sugar cane and vegetable oils
(first generation bioenergy) or from cellulose, hemicellulose or lignin sourced from non-food
crops or inedible waste products (second generation bioenergy). Bioenergy may play an
important role in mitigating climate change. It can be used as liquid fuel in the transport
sector to replace fossil-energy based fuels,leading to lower CO2 emissions. It can also be used
in the power sector as a replacement for coal or natural gas. In power and in hydrogen
production, bioenergy can also be combined with CCS to create a technology which could
actually remove emissions from the atmosphere (known as BECCS). Through this approach,
CO2 is absorbed during the growth phase of the biomass, and then captured and stored when
the biomass is converted to power or hydrogen (Azar et al., 2010; Read and Lermit, 2005). 

The downsides of bioenergy

However, the use of bioenergy may also have serious disadvantages. First, the production of
bioenergy crops requires land, putting it into competition with other activities (such as food
production) (Azar, 2005; Bringezu et al., 2009; Searchinger et al., 2008). Some studies have
reported that considerable food price increases may occur as a result of the direct and indirect
land-use impacts of bioenergy (indeed, price rises in 2008 and 2011 have also partly been
attributed to the rapid rise in bioenergy use). Secondly, bioenergy may have considerable GHG
emissions associated with its production. These include the emissions from nitrogen
fertilisers and fuel used during the growth and conversion phase, as well as the CO2 emissions
from land-use change either directly (conversion of natural ecosystems) or indirectly
(competition with other forms of land use may cause more natural ecosystems to be
converted to farmland; Searchinger et al., 2008; Smeets et al., 2009). In some cases, the
emissions associated with bioenergy may be as much as fossil fuels or even higher. These
impacts may be partly mitigated by: i) using second generation bioenergy (e.g. producing fuels

133

3. CLIMATE CHANGE

Box 3.13. Bioenergy: Panacea or Pandora’s Box? (cont.)

from grasses, woody biomass or even biologically derived waste which does not require
additional cropland to produce);  ii) the application of  sustainability  criteria; iii) careful
choices  for  high-yield  crops  which  limit  land-use  requirements  or  using  extensive
bioenergy  production  systems;  or  iv) the  use  of  biomass  both  in  material  and  energy
applications (so-called cascading). Finally, experience with bioenergy and CCS technologies
is still limited. Both face challenges related to climate policy uncertainty, public acceptance
and first-of-a-kind technology risks. CCS is currently much more expensive than other
technologies.

The impacts of bioenergy on biodiversity, land use, and food prices and availability thus
depend  on  rather  complex  interactions  in  the  agricultural  and  energy  system.  The
calculations for the OECD Environmental Outlook assume that bioenergy use occurs mostly in
the power sector and that fuel production is mostly based on second-generation bioenergy
(mainly from residues). The 450 Core scenario in the IMAGE model simulations assumes
that by around 2050 about 20% of primary energy use is supplied from bioenergy. While this
substantially reduces emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels, it also implies some
increased  emissions  from  land  use. The implications  for  biodiversity  are  discussed  in
Chapter 4.  As  the  exact  trade-offs  are  rather  uncertain  at  this  stage,  more  careful
monitoring of the use and impacts of bioenergy is needed. 

Can we get by without bioenergy?

The 550 Core scenario using the IMAGE model assumes a lower reliance on bioenergy. In
the 550 Core scenario, about 13% of total primary energy use is supplied by bioenergy, while
in the 550 Low bioenergy scenario this is reduced to 6.5%. An important question is whether
easily  substitutable  alternatives  exist  in  the  transport  sector.  In  these  calculations,
hydrogen produced from fossil fuels with CCS would be an alternative with only limited
additional costs; however, if this alternative cannot come about, relying less on bioenergy
may substantially increase  climate  policy costs.  Achieving  lower  concentration targets
(450 ppm) depends significantly on the use of BECCS. Achieving ambitious climate policy
scenarios with less reliance on bioenergy is likely to concentrate its use in the power sector
(in combination with BECCS). However, the complete exclusion of bioenergy use might
make very low concentration targets unachievable. Given these uncertainties, further work
will be important to explore options for sustainable bioenergy use, and several models will
be needed to better understand the impacts of different shares of bioenergy in mitigation
option portfolios.

Climate change mitigation and health co-benefits

Some  climate warming gases – such as black  carbon (Box 3.14), methane, sulphur
dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) – are also air pollutants which have negative health
impacts. Well-designed  climate mitigation policies  can  therefore also help to  meet air
pollution reduction objectives. Mitigation policies affect climate in the long run, while the
health benefits of reducing local air pollution will be felt in the short to medium run (Bollen
et al., 2009; UNEP, 2011b). In these cases, cost-benefits analyses should take account of
those additional co-benefits (see Chapter 6 for further discussion). While it is important to
stress that targeting short-lived climate forcers or GHGs should not detract from broader
GHG-mitigation policies and the need to achieve lasting decarbonisation of the economy,
these policies can be a complement to a full range of climate change action. 

134

OECD ENVIRONMENTAL OUTLOOK TO 2050 © OECD 2012

The existence of any health-related co-benefits can also to some extent depend on the
policy instruments being applied. If a cap-and-trade system is used to limit CO2 emissions,
any  additional  policy  instruments  applied  to  the  same  emission  sources  would  (as
mentioned above) not lead to further CO2-emission reductions – or any reductions in SO2
or NOx emissions, due to interactions with the CO2 cap (OECD, 2011b).

3. CLIMATE CHANGE

Box 3.14. The case of black carbon

Black carbon is produced from the incomplete combustion of solid or liquid fuels such as
fossil  fuels,  biofuels,  and  biomass.  It  is  not  a  single  substance,  but  is  the  fraction  of
particulate matter that most efficiently absorbs visible light (Bond et al., 2004; UNEP, 2011b).
The sources of black carbon emissions are numerous and include mobile diesel engines
without particulate traps, cooking stoves, savanna and forest burning, agricultural waste
combustion, and small-scale industry such as brick kilns and coke production (Bond and
Sun, 2005). Although black carbon is not a GHG, it is an important short-lived climate forcer
and  directly  affects  the  Earth’s  climate  by  absorbing  solar  radiation  in  the  upper
atmosphere, where it remains for days or weeks (Molina et al., 2009). Additionally, deposits
of black carbon on snow or ice change a region’s “albedo” – the proportion of incident light
reflected – leading to more absorbed solar radiation. 

It is difficult to measure the total net effect of black carbon, but limiting black carbon
emissions is one important element in a climate protection strategy (UNEP, 2011a). For
example, some CO2 mitigation measures result in short-term warming by also limiting co-
emitted sulphur (UNEP, 2011a). In addition to climate benefits, reducing black carbon can
have significant health and agricultural productivity benefits. The full implementation of
measures  to  jointly  curtail  black  carbon  and  tropospheric  (i.e. ground-level)  ozone
precursors would jointly prevent 2.4 million premature deaths, and the loss of between 1%
and 4% of the total annual production of wheat, rice, maize and soybeans (UNEP, 2011a).
Mitigation  approaches  vary  widely  by  country  due  to  differing  emitting  activities.
Emissions from OECD countries come largely  from diesel vehicles (EPA, 2011). In other
countries such as China and India, sources include cookstoves, brick kilns and coke ovens
– these also cause indoor air pollution. 

Marginal abatement costs for black carbon vary across regions and are higher in North
America and Europe where relatively low cost abatement measures for particulate matter
have  already  been  implemented  (Rypdal  et al.,  2009).  Given  black  carbon’s  regional
variance, more work is needed to develop the best policy approach for reducing it. Further
analysis  and  comparison  of  cost-effective  black  carbon  mitigation  strategies  could
integrate multiple criteria including i) local atmospheric conditions; ii) the proportion of
black carbon to other co-emitted particulate matter; iii) impact on sensitive regions where
snow/albedo effect is important; and iv) impact of black carbon emitting activities on non-
climate outcomes such as health and agricultural effects.

Climate change, green growth and green jobs 

Green growth means fostering economic growth and development while ensuring that
natural assets continue to provide the resources and environmental services on which our
well-being relies. To do that, it must catalyse innovation and investment that will underpin
sustained growth and give rise to new economic activities. The financing and investment
requirements of shifting the traditional carbon intensive energy sector to a low-carbon sector
would require an additional USD 1.6 trillion per year of investment between 2030 and 2050

OECD ENVIRONMENTAL OUTLOOK TO 2050 © OECD 2012

135

3. CLIMATE CHANGE

(USD 750 billion from 2010 to 2030) over and above existing investment (IEA, 2009b). However,
the IEA also estimates that the 17% (USD 46 trillion) increase in global energy investment
required to deliver low-carbon energy systems could yield cumulative fuel savings equal to
USD 112 trillion between 2010 and 2050 (IEA, 2009b). Domestic policies are necessary to
provide the adequate risk-return profile to make green investment more profitable than
business-as-usual options, with some authors calling for “investment-grade” climate policies
(Hamilton, 2009; OECD, 2012). The transition to a low-carbon economy will require the
development of new sectors and activities, requiring a new set of skills in both new jobs and
existing jobs (OECD, 2011a). Key sectors would include transport, directed towards more
efficient and alternative vehicles; building refurbishment and solar installation; and the
decarbonisation of the power sector, mainly involving investments in renewable energy
technologies. If public policy frameworks manage to shift private-sector investments to low-
carbon, climate-resilient alternatives, those investments will create new businesses and jobs
and offset losses from the “brown” economy model (IEA, forthcoming).

Labour market and skills development policies can make an important contribution to
greener  growth.  By  minimising  skill  bottlenecks  and  preventing  a  rise  in  structural
unemployment, these policies can make the transition to green growth quicker and more
beneficial. The OECD report Towards Green Growth (OECD, 2011e) underlines how an increasing
number of studies are  showing the potential for net  job  creation associated  with the
restructuring of the energy sector towards a cleaner energy mix.49 This means that through
shifting sources of energy towards renewable sources and emphasising non-energy intensive
sectors, climate policies could create more jobs than would be lost in the long run. By causing
important changes in relative prices, GHG-mitigation policy will affect the composition of both
final and intermediate demand and hence composition of labour demand. In particular, the
relative  price of  energy and  energy-intensive  goods  and services will  increase.50  The
macroeconomic impacts of climate policies on employment are various and the global effect is
not easy to establish; however, certain policy mixes can improve both environmental and
labour market performance (see Box 3.15 for an illustration). 

Box 3.15. What if… reducing GHGs could increase employment?

The OECD has investigated the labour market impacts of GHG-mitigation policies (Chateau
et al., 2011; OECD, 2011e). This analysis uses a specifically revised version of the ENV-linkages
model with labour market rigidities, i.e. frictions in the adjustment of wages to differences
between supply and demand of labour, to simulate an illustrative climate policy scenario
where the OECD area as a whole reduces emissions by 50% in 2050 compared to their 1990
levels (through implementing a joint ETS). Non-OECD countries are assumed to each reduce
their emissions by 25% in 2050 relative to business as-usual levels.

Table 3.10 indicates that this mitigation policy has a limited impact on economic growth
(real GDP levels are reduced by 0.8% for low labour market rigidity and by 2.1% for high rigidity)
and job creation (employment levels are reduced by 0.3 to 2.2%). When permit revenues are
redistributed in the form of uniform lump-sum transfers, mitigation costs increase with the
degree of labour market rigidity. Yet, even in the worst-case scenario, under very strong labour
market rigidities, economic growth is only slightly affected by the introduction of carbon
permits: on average in the OECD area, real GDP increases by almost 41% over the period
2013-2030, as compared to 44% in the absence of mitigation actions. The resulting slowdown
in job creation is more pronounced, but still limited.

However, for a medium level of labour market rigidity (between the two extremes presented
in Table 3.10), and if the lump-sum redistribution is replaced by a policy where permit
revenues are used to reduce taxation on labour, employment growth is boosted (Table 3.11).
OECD employment would increase by 0.8% in 2030 compared to the Baseline projection,
resulting in an increase of 7.5% between 2013 and 2030, compared with 6.5% in the absence of
mitigation actions. Moreover, there is no loss of purchasing power for workers.

These estimates illustrate how certain policy mixes can improve both environmental and
labour market performance. They also show that both the quality of labour market institutions
and the redistribution of permit revenues need to be jointly addressed in order to reap the full
potential benefit of climate change policies in terms of job creation. However, empirical
estimates on the degree of labour market imperfections are scarce, and therefore the numbers
presented here are purely illustrative.

These conclusions are in line with many other studies analysing the employment impact of
mitigation actions within the framework of a general equilibrium model. Such models,
including ENV-Linkages, allow an evaluation of the transition costs, but over a longer time
horizon. Certain employment gains induced by mitigation policies (or job losses avoided) are
not captured. Indeed, as innovation is intrinsically difficult to predict, the potential effects of
environmental policies in stimulating the innovation of new green technologies are not fully
captured.

3. CLIMATE CHANGE

There  are  several  limitations  to  the potential  positive  impact  on  jobs  of greening
growth. Firstly, the direct effect of energy sector composition of employment is limited,
since intensely polluting industries account for only a small share of the total workforce.
Secondly,  these  “first-round”  net  employment  impacts  do  not  fully  account  for  the
“second-round”  effects  of  a  change  in  energy  mix:  they  do  not  fully  capture  the  full
macroeconomic  impact  of  climate  policies.  Barriers  to  industrial  restructuring  could
hinder the reallocation process consecutive to mitigation policies and, ultimately, reduce
the pace of employment growth. Thirdly, as these policies would generally reduce GDP
(see Section 3), this could have negative impacts on aggregate employment. 

Public revenues raised by carbon pricing mechanisms could be used to reduce other taxes
and fiscal distortion in the economies. These  revenue-neutral  mitigation  policies are
sometimes advocated on the basis that they can generate a “double-dividend”: reducing GHGs
emissions and improving efficiency by reducing distortive taxes, such as labour taxes. 

Notes
1. See Chapter 1 for the methodology used for the Environmental Outlook, and Chapter 2 for the key
socio-economic assumptions behind the Baseline scenario. See Chapter 3, Section 2 on trends and
projections for further discussion of the existing policies that are included in the Baseline.

2. Mitigation  consists  of  activities  that  aim  to  reduce  GHGs,  directly  or  indirectly,  by  avoiding  or
capturing GHGs before they are emitted to the atmosphere or sequestering those already in the
atmosphere by enhancing “sinks” such as forests. Such activities may entail, for example, changes
to behavioural patterns or technology development and diffusion (IPCC, 2007).

3. Adaptation is defined as adjustments in human and natural systems, in response to actual or expected

climate stimuli or their effects, to moderate harm or exploit beneficial opportunities (IPCC, 2001).

4. The  Kyoto  Protocol  is  an  international  agreement  linked  to  the  United  Nations  Framework
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). It was adopted in Kyoto, Japan, on 11 December 1997
and entered into force on 16 February 2005. The major feature of the Kyoto Protocol is that it sets
binding  targets  for  37 industrialised  countries  and  the  European  Community  for  reducing
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. These amount to an average of 5% reduction from 1990 levels
between 2008 and 2012.

7. In the IPCC report, the median value is 3 oC and 2 oC-4.5 oC represents the 66% confidence interval.

This is the assumption used in the projections outlined in this Outlook.

8. Climate  sensitivity  is  a  measure  of  how  responsive  the  climate  system  is  to  a  change  in  the
radiative forcing. It is usually expressed as the temperature change associated with a doubling of
the concentration of carbon dioxide in Earth’s atmosphere.

9. The  term  overturning  or  thermoaline  circulation  refers  to  the  part  of  the  large-scale  ocean
circulation that is driven by global density gradients created by surface heat and freshwater fluxes.
Computer models predict  that  more freshwater flowing into a  few crucial places in  the North
Atlantic could slow, or even stop, dense water forming and sinking. This could shut down the
return flow in this current.

10. Other economists (e.g. Nordhaus, 2011 and Pindyck, 2011) suggest that Weitzman’s Dismal Theory,
which says that cost-benefit analysis breaks down due to potential catastrophes, only holds under
very specific circumstances.

dioxide and other GHGs as pollutants. See www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/06pdf/05-1120.pdf.

19. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a means of reducing the contribution of fossil fuel emissions to
global warming. The process is based on capturing carbon dioxide (CO2) from large point sources, such
as fossil fuel power plants, and storing it in such a way that it does not enter the atmosphere.

20. In these baseline-and-credit plans there is no explicit cap on aggregate emissions. Instead, each
firm has the right to emit a certain baseline level of emissions. This baseline may be derived from
historical  emissions  or  from  a  performance  standard  that  specifies  the  permitted  ratio  of
emissions to output. Firms create emission reduction credits by emitting fewer than their baseline
emissions.

21. “Offsets” are a general term referring to credits that offset the need to reduce emissions elsewhere.

22. Joint implementation is one of three flexibility mechanisms set forth in the Kyoto Protocol to help
countries  with  binding GHG emissions  targets  (Annex  I Parties) meet  their obligations. Under
Article  6, any  Annex I  country  can invest in  emission reduction projects  (referred  to  as “Joint
Implementation Projects”) in any other Annex I country as an alternative to reducing emissions
domestically.

25. The purpose of the CDM is to promote clean development in developing countries. The CDM allows
industrialised countries to invest in emission-reduction projects wherever it is cheapest globally. The
emission-reduction projects in developing countries can earn certified emission reduction (CER)
credits, each equivalent to one tonne of CO2. These CERs can be traded and sold, and used by
industrialised countries to meet a part of their emission reduction targets under the Kyoto Protocol.

incentives  problems  when  investors  cannot  capture  the  benefits;  transaction  costs;  price
distortions; informational barriers on the part of the consumers to make rational consumption
and  investment decisions; incentive structures that encourage energy providers  to sell  energy
rather than invest in energy efficiency; and technical barriers (see IEA, 2009a).

31. Parties to the UNFCCC must submit national reports on their implementation of the Convention to
the Conference of the Parties (COP). The core elements of the national communications for both
Annex I and non-Annex I Parties are information on emissions and removals of GHGs and details
of the activities a Party has undertaken to implement the Convention.

36. BECCS combine bioenergy in power and in hydrogen production with carbon capture and storage
(CCS) to create a technology which could actually remove emissions from the atmosphere: CO2 is
absorbed  during  the  growth  phase  of  the  biomass,  and  then  captured  and  stored  when  the
biomass  is  converted  to  power  or  hydrogen  (Azar  et al.,  2010;  Read  and  Lermit,  2005).  Several
studies have identified BECCS as an attractive mitigation option later in the century (van Vuuren
and Riahi, 2011).

37. The label “delayed action” does not imply that all action is delayed, but rather that in the coming

decades less mitigation takes place than in the other scenarios.

38. Due  to  the  cooling  effect  of  the  aerosols,  these  concentration  levels  are  lower  than  the

corresponding concentration levels of the Kyoto gases only.

39. The  long-term  equilibrium  temperature  increase  will  be  lower  than  2 oC,  as  by  the  end  of  the
century the declining concentrations of GHGs are already projected to lead to less radiative forcing.

40. The IMAGE suite of models assume that a larger share would come from fuel switching, and have

more conservative estimates on energy efficiency improvements.

41. However, energy efficiency also plays a role in the OECD region – energy efficiency improvements

are an essential part of a cost-effective mix of mitigation options.

42. Average energy intensity also differs across regions due to national circumstances, including climate.

43. Information from UNFCCC website (www.unfccc.int), accessed August 2011.

44. The calculations are based on the methodology described in Den Elzen et al. (2011), but revised to
reflect the Environmental Outlook Baseline projections. More information on the assumptions behind
the assessment of the pledges is given in Annex 3.A.

45. Remember that the benefits of mitigation action are not represented in the cost figures calculated

using the ENV-Linkages model.

46. Clearly,  these  cost  estimates  depend  crucially  on  the  assumptions  that  are  made  about  the
availability and cost-effectiveness of the major mitigation options shown in Box 3.10 on key energy
technologies.

47. Regional  income  losses  depend  on  the  permit  allocation  scheme,  which  is  based  on  equal  per-

capita emission allowances in both mitigation scenarios.

48. This annual level fluctuates widely with changes in international energy prices but it also indicates

that some recent reform has been undertaken in some major countries (China and India).

49. For example see the recent report by UNEP, ILO, IOE and ITUC, “Green Jobs: Towards Decent Work in a

Sustainable, Low-Carbon World” (UNEP/ILO/IOE/ITUC, 2008).

50. Eco-innovation is also likely to have important relative price effects, while also directly affecting
labour input and job skill requirements in sectors making use of the new technologies. As a result,
new jobs will be created while many existing jobs will need to be “greened” even as others will
have to be reallocated from downsizing to expanding sectors or firms.

ANNEX 3.A 

Modelling Background Information on Climate Change

This  annex  provides  further  descriptions  of  some  of  the  assumptions  behind  the

model-based policy simulations used in this chapter. 

The Baseline scenario

The  OECD  Environmental  Outlook  Baseline  scenario  makes  projections  of  a  number  of

socio-economic developments (summarised in Chapters 1 and 2):

■ Based on assumptions governing a conditional convergence of the drivers of economic
growth across countries, world GDP  is projected  to  nearly quadruple over the coming
four  decades,  in  line  with  the  past  40 years  and  based  on  detailed  projections  on  the
main drivers of economic growth. By 2050, the OECD’s share of the global economy is
assumed to decline from 54% in 2010 to less than 32%, while the share of Brazil, Russia,
India, Indonesia, China and South Africa (BRIICS) is assumed to grow to more than 40%. 

■ By 2050, the world is assumed to add over 2.2 billion people to the current 7 billion. All
world regions are assumed to be facing population ageing but will be at different stages
of this demographic transition.

■ By 2050, nearly 70% of the world’s population is assumed to be living in urban areas. 

■ World  energy  demand  is  assumed  to  be  80%  higher  in 2050  under  current  policies.
The 2050 global energy mix is assumed to be fairly similar to today’s, with the share of
fossil  energy  still  at  about  85%  (of  commercial  energy),  renewables  including  biofuels
(but  excluding  traditional  biomass)  just  above  10%,  with  the  balance  being  nuclear.
Among  fossil  fuels,  it  is  uncertain  whether  coal  or  gas  will  be  the  main  source  of
increased energy supply. 

■ Globally, the area of agricultural land is assumed to expand in the next decade, but at a
slower  rate.  It  is  assumed  to  peak  before 2030  to  match  the  increase  in  food  demand
from a growing population, and decline thereafter, as population growth slows down and
yield  improvements  continue  (Box 3.2).  Deforestation  rates  are  already  declining,  and
this  trend  is  assumed  to  continue,  especially  after 2030  with  demand  for  more
agricultural land easing.

■ No new climate policies are assumed to be introduced, but policies in existence in 2010
are assumed to still be in operation. For instance, the EU Emission Trading Scheme (ETS,
see Section 4) is included in the Baseline until 2012 (as these policies are already in place).
Additional  (new)  legislated  policies  in  the  European  Union  are  not  reflected  in  the
Baseline,  but  the  European  Union’s  energy  and  climate  package  is  assumed  to  be

implemented  in  all  policy  simulations  carried  out  in  the  analysis.  Energy-efficiency
measures already in place (in the European Union and other countries) are also included
in the Baseline.

While  there  are  substantial  uncertainties  around  the  assumptions,  the  Baseline
projected global trend in GHG emissions is within the range of plausible trends identified
in  a  number  of  model  comparison  exercises  (e.g those  done  by  the  United  Nations
Environment Programme – UNEP, 2010; the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change –
IPCC, 2007a, b&c; and the Energy Modelling Forum – Clark et al., 2009).

The 450 ppm climate stabilisation scenarios

The  450 Core  scenario  pathway  is  modelled  by  the  IMAGE  model,  and  allows  for
temporary  overshooting  of  the  concentration  levels  in  the  middle  of  the  century.  The
associated emissions pathway is chosen such that total costs of achieving the target are
minimised according to the mitigation technologies available in IMAGE. The ENV-Linkages
model harmonises with the corresponding emissions pathway. In the 450 Accelerated Action
pathway,  higher  mitigation  efforts  are  imposed  for  the  first  few  decades,  implying  less
negative emissions in the second half of the century stemming from the BECCS (bioenergy
with  CCS)  technology.  Finally,  the  450 Delayed  Action  pathway  is  based  on  fragmented
carbon  markets  until 2020  with  targets  based  on  the  high  end  of  the  pledges  in  the
Copenhagen Accord/Cancún Agreements (see below for more details), and a global carbon
market from 2021 onwards. 

These  scenarios  all  assume  a  burden  sharing  regime  based  on  contraction  and
convergence:  global  emissions  contract  over  time  according  to  the  global  pathway,  and
regional emission allowances (i.e. regional permit allocation) as a share of the global budget
converge  from  shares  in  current  emission  levels  to  equal  per-capita  emissions  by 2050
(see also  simulation 2 below).  Note  that  in  the  450 Delayed  Action  scenario  the  burden
sharing regime only applies after 2020.

Fossil  fuel  subsidy  reform  is  not  included  in  these  scenarios,  but  investigated

separately (see below).

Alternative permit allocation schemes 

The regional shares of permits used for the permit allocation schemes presented in
Box 3.9 are  reported  in  Figure 3.A1  below.  In  the  Global  carbon  tax  scenario  (called
“450 carbon tax” in the figure) allocation of permits is an endogenous result of the model.
It corresponds to the rule where there is no gain from permit trading among countries. For
the other rules, when the share of permits received is greater than the share in the global
carbon tax case, the country will export permits (and vice versa).

Technology options in the 450 ppm scenario 

These  policy  scenarios 

incorporate  alternative  assumptions  about  advanced
technologies to explore how dependant the energy systems in the different regions are on
these energy technologies (Box 3.10 in main text). The technology specifications are based
on the concurrent Energy Modelling Forum exercise (EMF24) in which both ENV-Linkages
and  IMAGE  are  participating.  These  scenarios  are  variants  of  the  450 Accelerated  Action

scenario, with all major mitigation technologies available, using the following technology
assumptions:

■ No CCS: in the alternative setting CCS is restricted to levels as they are projected in the
Baseline,  and  cannot  expand  further.  CCS  in  the  Baseline  is  not  directed  at  avoiding
emissions  to  the  atmosphere,  but  for  use  of  CO2  in  the  enhanced  oil  recovery  (EOR)
technology.

■ The  progressive  nuclear  phase-out  scenario  is  constructed  assuming  that  nuclear
capacity  currently  under  construction  and  planned  until 2020  will  be  built  and
connected  to  the  grid  (data  sourced  from  IAEA  Power  Reactor  Information  System
database). These mid-term nuclear capacities are consistent with the projections from
the IEA Current Policies Scenario (IEA, 2009b). After 2020, no new nuclear unit is allowed,
so that the world total capacity by 2050 will be reduced because of the natural retirement
of existing plants that come at the end of their technical lifetime. By 2020, cumulative
nuclear capacity additions in OECD represent one-third of the total 105 GW. Remaining
additions are built in the BRIICS countries, with China alone representing almost half of
total new capacity. The expansion of the nuclear fleet in the RoW countries is negligible.
The  estimated  world  nuclear  capacity  in  this  scenario  reaches  about  460 GW  in 2020,
starting  from  current  390 GW,  and  falls  down  to  about  240 GW  by 2050,  a  four-fold
reduction compared to the 450 scenario (Figure 3.A2).

develop more slowly over time than in the 450 Accelerated Action scenario. Both are 20%
lower  than  the  base  by 2050,  leading  to  slower  adoption  of  efficiency  measures  and
slower deployment of renewable technologies.

Cancún Agreements/Copenhagen Accord pledges 

Some  interpretation  of  the  Cancún  Agreements/Copenhagen  Accord  pledges  and
targets is necessary for the specification of the 450 Delayed Action scenario, because some
pledges are provided in the form of a range, which is dependent on the action or financing
of other countries. Due to limited specific information on how countries plan to meet their
targets  or  actions,  uncertainty  remains  about  how  the  emissions  reductions  will  affect
different sectors, how much financing will be received from international sources, and how
emission reductions are counted towards pledges or offsets. The most important assumptions
for interpretation are:

■ The  methodology  for  assessing  the  pledges  is  based  on  Den  Elzen  et al. (2011),  but  the

evaluation has been revised to reflect the OECD Environmental Outlook Baseline projections.

In order to estimate costs and effectiveness in a consistent manner, all Annex I emission
reduction targets are translated into reductions from the same base year (1990) and all
non-Annex I mitigation actions, including the emission intensity targets of China and
India, are expressed as emission reductions from business as usual (BAU) in 2020.1 The
ENV-Linkages Baseline projections are used for this evaluation, rather than the national
baselines used by countries in their submission; this may cause substantial differences
(this especially holds for South Africa, and therefore the target for South Africa has been
revised  to  reflect  the  differences  in  baselines).  In  line  with  the  general  modelling

150

OECD ENVIRONMENTAL OUTLOOK TO 2050 © OECD 2012

■
3. CLIMATE CHANGE

framework, countries are assumed to implement their policies through the introduction
of an economy-wide Emission Trading Scheme (ETS), with full auction of permits. 

■ Due to the limited information available on what offset policies might be in the future,
and to what extent countries intend to meet their pledge through the use of offsets, this
analysis requires ad hoc assumptions about the level of offsets. For Annex I countries, an
assumption of 20% of the total required emission reductions2 is assumed to be achieved
through international offsets, with two exceptions: i) Canada has currently no government
policy on international offset purchases (which is interpreted in the simulations as no use
of  offsets  for  Canada);  and  ii) the  European  Union  is  assumed  to  limit  offsets  to
4 percentage-points  (for  the  20%  reduction  targets  this  is  equivalent  to  the  default
assumption of 20%, but for the higher pledge of 30% reduction this constitutes an offset
percentage of 13% of the mitigation requirements). The offsets are assumed to be entirely
international and flexible across non-Annex I countries. Further, emission reductions in
non-Annex I countries cannot be double-counted towards both domestic pledges and for
sale  in  the  international  offset  market.  The  default  of  20%  is  varied  in  sensitivity
analysis.

■ With  respect  to  credits  from  land  use,  land-use  change  and  forestry  (LULUCF),  the
assumption is made that Annex I countries will use a net-net accounting rule for credits
from  this  sector  using 2020  as  base  year.3  The  OECD  Environmental  Outlook  Baseline
projection for LULUCF emissions is used to calculate the volume of credits. This leads to
additional credits for most Annex I countries. Note that the current Kyoto Protocol rules
for LULUCF accounting are more lenient and would therefore imply more credits from
this  sector,  less  emission  reductions  in  the  other  sectors  and  lower  short  term  costs.
Non-Annex I countries use REDD activities to reach their pledge, but REDD activities are
excluded from the international offset system.

International financing of mitigation actions in non-Annex I countries is assumed to be
limited  to Brazil, Mexico and South  Africa.  China, India  and Indonesia  have explicitly
stated that their actions are unilateral, whereas no commitments are assumed for the
Middle East and rest of the world regions. By default, 50% of domestic costs are assumed
to be compensated by Annex I countries, but this is varied in a sensitivity analysis.

■ Some  countries  are  likely  to  have  emission  levels  that  are  below  their  targets  for  the
current  commitment  period  of  the  Kyoto  Protocol  (2008-2012);  this  creates  so-called
surplus Assigned Amount Units (AAUs). Based on the Baseline projection, the amount of
surplus AAUs is estimated to be 6.5 GtCO2e for Russia, 1.9 GtCO2e for the Rest of Europe
group  of  countries  (primarily  Ukraine),  and  0.7 GtCO2e  for  the  European  Union  and
European Free Trade Area (EFTA). The existence of surplus AAUs in the post-2012 period
would effectively allow for higher emissions in that period than would occur otherwise
(see den  Elzen  et al., 2011,  for  further  discussion)  and  thus  would  reduce  the  costs  of
action. The impact of potential surplus AAUs depends in part on the assumptions about
use of the units across accounting periods. As a default, no use of these surplus AAUs in
the  period 2013-2020 is  assumed.  For  Russia  and  Rest  of  Europe  this  is  varied  in  a
sensitivity analysis, but the surplus for the European Union and EFTA is not used in any
simulation as the European Union has stated it will not use its surplus.4

■ Note that the non-binding targets for Russia and Rest of Europe in the period 2013-2020
also  imply  that  they  have  some  scope  to  sell  permits  without  undertaking  additional
mitigation actions when international permit trading is allowed in the simulations.

Phasing out fossil fuel subsidies 

This policy scenario (discussed in Section 4 of the main text) is based on the analysis
for the G20 on reform of fossil fuel subsidies. The ENV-Linkages model Baseline scenario
has  been  updated  using  the  latest  IEA  fossil  fuel  based  consumer  subsidies  for  the
year 2009  (for  developing  economies).  The  IEA  energy  price  gaps  calculated  by  the  IEA
(2010)  have  been  introduced  in  the  ENV-Linkages  model  as  percentage  price-wedges
between  consumer  prices  and  reference  or  world  prices.  A  negative  wedge  is  then
considered  as a subsidy rate. Since 2010 this IEA database  covers 37 countries,  of  which
35 are non-OECD and 2 OECD, for the years 2007-2009 (IEA, 2009b).5 These prices gaps only
fall  on  fossil  fuel  based  energy  consumption  but  distinguish  both  VAT  tax  rates  from
subsidy  rates.  In  the  ENV-Linkages  Baseline  projection  it  is  assumed  that  after 2009  the
subsidy  and  VAT  tax  rates  remain  constant  in  percentage  terms  up  to 2050.  Since 2009
subsidy  rates  are  lower  than 2008  rates  used  in  Burniaux  and  Chateau  (2011)  one  could
consider  that  the  new  Baseline  takes  into  account  the  latest  fossil  fuel  subsidy  reforms
undertaken during 2009. 

In the policy simulations of generic subsidy reforms the subsidy rates are gradually
phased-out  over  the  period 2013  to 2020.  Two  experiments  are  undertaken.  In  the  first
simulation there is a stand-alone multilateral fossil fuel reform in all the 37 countries of
the IEA database with no mitigation policies elsewhere (and no EU-ETS after 2012); this is
an update of the G20 report simulation. The second simulation assesses the case where
these fossil fuel reforms are associated with the 450 Core mitigation scenario. This second
simulation  allows  an  assessment  of  the  importance  of  fossil  fuel  subsidy  reform  in  a
context where carbon leakages are partly frozen by overall mitigation action.

Notes
1. Given the expected relatively small impact of the policies on GDP in China and India, the intensity

target can be approximated by an absolute cap on emissions.

2. The 20% limit on offsets in most Annex I regions is in line with the assumption in OECD (2009a).

3. An  exception  is  the  assumption  that  when  the  low  ends  of  the  pledges  are  implemented,  no

LULUCF credits are assumed for the European Union and European Free Trade Area.

4. In  the  alternative  specification,  the  surplus  is  progressively  used  over  the  years,  as  reduction
targets become more strict; thus 22% of the surplus enters the market in 2020. This is in contrast
with  other  models  that  assume  the  same  amount  of  surplus  AAUs  will  be  used  yearly
between 2013 and 2020 (see UNEP, 2010).

Biodiversity

by

Katia Karousakis, Mark van Oorschot (PBL), Edward Perry, Michel Jeuken (PBL), 

Michel Bakkenes (PBL), with contribution from Hans Meijl and Andrzej Tabeau (LEI)

Biodiversity loss is a major environmental challenge facing humankind. Despite
some local successes, biodiversity is on the decline globally and this loss is projected
to  continue.  Continuing  with business as usual may have far-reaching  adverse
implications  for human well-being, security and economic growth. This chapter
summarises the considerable benefits and often hidden values of biodiversity and
the ecosystems of which it is a part. It then looks at trends in several indicators of
biodiversity – species abundance (e.g. mean species abundance or MSA), threatened
species, forest area (deforestation) and marine fish stocks – and the implications
of business-as-usual  trends  continuing  to  the  year 2050  under  the  OECD
Environmental Outlook Baseline scenario. The chapter provides an overview of
the  different  policy  instruments  available  for  biodiversity  conservation  and
sustainable use, ranging from regulations to market-driven approaches, such as
payments for ecosystem services (PES). Some more ambitious policy scenarios are
examined – such as the implications of meeting the Aichi Biodiversity Target under
the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) to expand the global protected area
network to at least 17% of terrestrial land by 2020. Possible synergies and trade-offs
of  meeting  climate  mitigation  goals  (through  different  bioenergy  and  land  use
scenarios, for example) and the impacts  on biodiversity are also examined. The
chapter concludes with a discussion of key needs for further policy action in the
context of biodiversity and how this links to the broader green growth agenda.

KEY MESSAGES

Biodiversity – the diversity of living organisms – is declining at the global level. Loss of biodiversity

and the degradation of ecosystems and the services they provide are one of the major environmental
challenges facing humankind. Continuing with business as usual will have adverse and costly impacts
on  human  well-being,  security  and  economic  growth.  Reversing  these  trends  will  require  a  more
consistent,  co-ordinated  and  strategic  response,  driven  by  a  high  level  of  political  commitment  and
broader  stakeholder  involvement. A coherent and  comprehensive  policy  mix will be needed to  foster
economic growth and development while ensuring that biodiversity continues to provide the resources
and ecosystem services upon which our well-being relies.

Trends and projections
Biodiversity and natural ecosystems

The Environmental Outlook Baseline or business-as-usual scenario projects biodiversity (measured as
terrestrial mean species abundance) to decline by about 10% between 2010 and 2050 globally, with
especially  high  losses  in  parts  of  Asia,  Europe  and  Southern  Africa.  These  losses  will  be  driven
mainly  by  land-use  change  and  management  (e.g. for  pasture,  food  crops  and  bioenergy),
commercial  forestry,  infrastructure  development,  habitat  encroachment  and  fragmentation,
pollution (e.g. nitrogen deposition) and climate change.

Disturbance can damage ecosystems irreversibly, with negative social, environmental and economic
impacts.  The lack  of  understanding of  the complex non-linear  dynamics of ecosystems and  the
uncertainties  surrounding  these  thresholds  means  that  continued  loss  of  biodiversity  poses
significant risks and calls for a precautionary approach.
Invasive alien species are considered to be an important driver of biodiversity loss across the globe.
This pressure is likely to increase over the next few decades.

After 2030  the  area  of  natural  land  converted  to  agriculture  is  projected  to  decrease  under  the
Baseline  as  a  result  of  improved  productivity,  stabilising  populations  and  dietary  changes,  thus
reducing  pressure  on  biodiversity  and  ecosystems.  Nevertheless,  the  impacts on  biodiversity  will
continue for decades after land has ceased to be cultivated.
Globally, the number and size of protected areas have increased and now account for nearly 13% of the
global terrestrial area. However, temperate grasslands, savannas, shrublands and marine ecosystems are
poorly represented and only 7.2% of territorial seas are designated as Marine Protected Areas. 
A  new  policy  package  for  biodiversity  was  agreed  by  the  10th Conference  of  the  Parties  to  the
Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) in 2010. Parties successfully agreed on the Strategic Plan
for Biodiversity 2011-2020, the Aichi Biodiversity Targets for 2020, a Resource Mobilisation Strategy,
and  the  Nagoya  Protocol  on  Access  to  Genetic  Resources  and  the  Fair  and  Equitable  Sharing  of
Benefits Arising from their Utilisation. 

Forests

Primary  forests,  which  tend  to  be  most  rich  in  biodiversity,  have  been  on  the  decline  and  are
projected to decrease steadily to 2050 in all regions under the Baseline scenario.

The  rate  of global  deforestation  has  recently  slowed.  The  Baseline  projects  no  net  forest  loss
after 2020, and an expansion in forest cover to 2050 due to regeneration, restoration, reforestation
and afforestation (including plantations), mainly in OECD and large emerging economies. However,
an increase in the forested area does not necessarily mean a reduction in biodiversity loss as there
will be more commercial and plantation forestry which supports less biodiversity. 

Fisheries

The  proportion of fish stocks  that  are over-exploited or  depleted  has  increased over  the past  few
decades. Today, over 30% of marine fish stocks are over-exploited or depleted, around 50% are fully
exploited and fewer than 20% have the potential for increased harvests.

Policy options and needs
■ Adopt  more  ambitious  policy  measures  to  achieve  internationally  agreed  plans,  targets  and
strategies, such as the Aichi protected area targets of 17% of the world’s terrestrial and inland water
areas and 10% of coastal and marine areas by 2020, agreed under the CBD. Outlook simulations suggest
that  in  order  to  reach  the  17%  terrestrial  target  in  a  way  that  is  also  ecologically  representative,  a
further 9.8 million km2 of land would need to be protected.

■ Mainstream  and  integrate  biodiversity  conservation  and  sustainable  use  into  other  policy  areas
(e.g. economic affairs, agriculture, fisheries, forestry, land-use and urban planning, development co-
operation, climate change, national accounting and R&D) to enhance synergies and prevent trade-offs.
For example, some greenhouse gas mitigation strategies provide greater benefits to biodiversity than
others.  A  mitigation  strategy  involving  heavy  reliance  on  bioenergy  could  require  an  expansion  of
agricultural land, reducing the net benefits to biodiversity. Conversely, the financial mechanism for

4. BIODIVERSITY

reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD) in developing countries could
also have benefits for biodiversity.

■ Remove and reform environmentally harmful subsidies, including those that promote, without any
environmental considerations, the intensification or geographic expansion of economic sectors such
as agriculture, bioenergy, fishing, forestry and transport. Subsidy reform can also increase economic
efficiency and reduce the fiscal pressures confronting governments.

■ Scale  up  private-sector  engagement  in  biodiversity  conservation  and  sustainable  use,  including
through innovative financing mechanisms at the local, national and international level. Clear price
signals for natural resource use and pollution are needed that provide certainty yet offer the private
sector  flexibility  in  determining  how  they  can  most  cost-effectively  reduce  their  impacts  on
ecosystems.
Improve the quantity and quality of data available to inform biodiversity policy (at local, regional and
global  levels)  and  make  further  progress  on  the  economic  valuation  of  biodiversity  and  ecosystem
services.

1. Introduction

Biodiversity loss is a major environmental challenge facing humankind today. Despite
some local successes, biodiversity is on the decline globally and this loss is projected to
continue. Continuing with business as usual may have far-reaching adverse implications
for human well-being, security and economic growth. 

This  chapter  summarises  the  considerable  benefits  and  often  hidden  values  of
biodiversity and the ecosystems of which it is a part. It then looks at the current trends in
several aspects of biodiversity – species abundance, threatened species, forest area and
marine stocks – and the implications of business-as-usual biodiversity trends continuing
to the year 2050. The chapter then provides an overview of the different policy options
available for biodiversity conservation and sustainable use, ranging from regulations to
market-driven approaches. Some more ambitious policy scenarios are examined – such as
the implications of meeting the new internationally agreed target of 17% of terrestrial land
as protected areas. The chapter concludes with a discussion of key needs for further policy
action in the context of biodiversity, and how this links to the broader green growth agenda
(see Chapter 1).

Biodiversity: An invisible life support system

Biodiversity is defined as the “variability among living organisms from all sources,
including, inter alia, terrestrial, marine, and other aquatic ecosystems, and the ecological
complexes of which they are a part: this includes diversity within species, between species
and of ecosystems” (Article 2 of the Convention on Biological Diversity). Biodiversity and
ecosystems provide invaluable (but largely unvalued) services to people and the natural
environment, locally, regionally and globally. The 2005 Millennium Ecosystem Assessment
(MA) identified four types of ecosystem services: regulating, supporting, provisioning, and
cultural services, which together maintain critical life-support functions (Figure 4.1).

The benefits generated by these services are captured in the notion of total economic
value (TEV), which aggregates direct and indirect use values and non-use values (Box 4.1).
The total economic value of biodiversity and ecosystem services is large. For example, the
worldwide  economic  value  of  pollination  services  provided  by  insect  pollinators  was
estimated at USD 192 billion per year in 2005 (Gallai et al., 2009). First sale value of global
capture fisheries is almost USD 94 billion per year (FAO, 2010a) and the global net value of
coral  reefs  for  fisheries,  coastal  protection,  tourism  and  biodiversity  is  estimated  at
USD 30 billion  per  year  (UNEP, 2007).  Moreover,  every  year  wildlife  trade  generates  an
estimated USD 15 billion worldwide, excluding large-scale commercial trade in fish and
timber  (OECD, 2008a).  Estimates  suggest  that  the  aggregate  loss  of  biodiversity  and
ecosystem service benefits associated with the global loss of forests is between USD 2 and
5 trillion per year (TEEB, 2009).

Box 4.1. Valuing biodiversity: The components of total economic value

The notion of total economic value (TEV) is composed of use and non-use values:

■ Use values: derived directly from biodiversity in the form of consumables (e.g. food and

wood) and indirectly through non-consumable services (e.g. climate regulation).

■ Non-use values: existence, bequest and option values.

❖ Existence  values  are  the  benefits  individuals  derive  from  the  knowledge  that

biodiversity exists.

❖ Bequest values are the benefits individuals derive knowing that these will be available

to future generations.

❖ Option values reflect the value people place on the potential for future use, and how
future  advances  in  information  can  reveal  new  use  or  non-use  values  (e.g.  for
pharmaceutical purposes).

The biodiversity financing gap

These values (or benefits) of biodiversity and ecosystem services provide a compelling
case for investing in conservation and sustainable use. While it is difficult to estimate both
the financing needs for optimal biodiversity and ecosystem service  provision, and the
existing financing flows, it is clear that the financing gap is large. Current levels of financial
flows  for  biodiversity have been  estimated at USD 36-38 billion per  year, about  half of

which  is  delivered  domestically  in  the  European  Union,  the  United  States  and  China
(Parker and Cranford, 2010).

Financing needs will vary according to the level of ambition. One estimate suggests
that an additional USD 18-27.5 billion per year is required to establish a comprehensive
protected  area  (PA)  network  covering  10-15%  of  the  global  terrestrial  area,  with  an
additional  USD 290 billion  required  for  conservation  outside  PAs  (James  et al., 2001).
Pursuing  a  more  ambitious  PA  target  of  15%  of  terrestrial  area  and  30%  of  oceans  is
estimated to cost USD 45 billion per year over 30 years (Balmford et al., 2002). Building on
these studies, Berry (2007) estimates that a total of between USD 355 and 385 billion per
year is needed for financing additional climate change adaptation in terrestrial and marine
PAs and the wider landscape matrix. While these estimates may seem large, the costs of
inaction in many areas are considerable.

The large biodiversity financing gap is exacerbated by the fact that most biodiversity-
rich areas are located in developing countries, which are least able to afford conservation
measures and where pressures to convert land to other uses tend to be high (Figure 4.2).

A major wilderness area is identified as biodiverse if it has 75% of the original vegetation remaining in pristine
condition and a low human population density (< 5 people/km2). Wilderness areas are based largely on the world’s
terrestrial ecoregions (see Olson et al., 2001).

The year 2010 was politically important for biodiversity. It marked the culmination of
the 2010 biodiversity target to “significantly reduce the rate of biodiversity loss” agreed by
Parties  to  the  Convention  on  Biological  Diversity  (CBD)  in 2002.  However,  it  is  widely

acknowledged that this target has not been met. Recognising the challenges ahead and the
need for further action, the UN General Assembly declared 2010 as the International Year
of  Biodiversity,  and 2011-2020 as  the  UN  Decade  of  Biodiversity.  The  United  Nations
Conference  on  Sustainable  Development  in 2012,  known  as  Rio+20,  also  provides  an
opportunity to secure renewed commitment to the conservation and sustainable use of
biodiversity, to highlight its role in human well-being and development in the context of
green growth, and to leverage synergies between the three Rio Conventions.1

2. Key trends and projections 

Biodiversity trends: Past and present

Although there is no single, comprehensive metric to monitor and assess the state of
biodiversity, the Parties to the CBD agreed on 17 headline indicators to evaluate progress
towards the 2010 targets and to communicate trends in biodiversity.2 These indicators
include the extent and types of forest area, coverage of protected areas, change in status of
threatened species, areas under sustainable management, invasive alien species, and a
marine trophic index.3 Data on species abundance, threatened species, forest area, and
marine stocks –  some of the few  indicators which are  available both globally and over
time – are examined below. 

Species abundance 

Species abundance refers to the population sizes of species. Two indicators that can be
used to assess changes in species abundance are mean species abundance (MSA) and the
Living Planet Index (LPI). The MSA provides a measure of the change in populations of
species relative to intact or pristine ecosystems. MSA is determined by the intensity of
human  pressure,  according  to  established  dose-response  relations  between  these
pressures and MSA (Alkemade et al., 2009).4 The LPI is based on observed trends in almost
8 000 populations of over 2 500 vertebrate species (mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians
and fish).  The index  is the aggregated score of changes in the population size of each
species since 1970, which is given a value of 1 (WWF, ZSL and GFN, 2010).

As depicted in Figures 4.3 and 4.4, both indicators suggest a decline in global species
abundance. More specifically, global MSA declined by nearly 11% between 1970 and 2010.
Of  course,  changes  in  species  abundance  are  not  distributed  equally  across  biomes5
(Figure 4.3), and MSA loss has been most pronounced in temperate forests (a 24% decline),
followed by tropical forests (13%) and scrubland and savannah (16%).6 According to the LPI,
the period 1970-2007 witnessed a 30% decline in global abundance of vertebrate species
(Figure 4.4).7

Threatened species

The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) maintains a Red List
of  Threatened  Species,  categorising  them  as  of  least  concern,  near  threatened,
vulnerable, endangered, critically endangered, and extinct. It has also devised a Red List
Index to measure changes in the risk of extinction for four sets of species – corals, birds,
mammals, amphibians (Figure 4.5). This indicates the proportion of species expected to
still be present in the near future if no additional conservation action is taken. The index
is calculated from the number of species in each Red List category and the number of

162

species that moved between categories as a result of genuine changes in threat status.8
The  status  of  all  four  sets  of  species  has  deteriorated  since 1980.  Amphibians  are
currently the most threatened group of species, while the status of corals is deteriorating
fastest.

Forest area

Forests tend to be highly diverse and provide multiple ecosystem services including
habitat  provision,  carbon  sequestration,  water  regulation  and  erosion  prevention.
Information on the extent of forest cover9 is therefore an important indicator of global
biodiversity. Between 1990 and 2010, global forest cover decreased from 41.7 million km2 to
40.3 million km2 (Figure 4.6). However, while deforestation remains a cause of concern,
annual deforestation rates are slowing down: in the 1990s, an average of approximately
160 000 km2 of forest were either converted for human use or lost to natural causes each
year. Between 2000 and 2010 this figure was 130 000 km2 a year (FAO, 2010b). Primary forest

loss decreased from 60 000 km2 per year between 1990 and 2000 to 40 000 km2 per year
between 2000 and 2010 (FAO, 2006; 2010b).

Today, primary forests account for 36% of global forest cover, whereas 57% is “other
naturally regenerated forest” and 7% is planted forests (FAO, 2010b). The global area for
planted forests has increased by about 50 000 km2 a year over the past five years, mainly
due to afforestation (establishment of forests through planting and/or seeding on land that
is not classified as forest). A number of countries are witnessing a net increase in forest
cover partly as a result of natural expansion, but largely from an increase in planted forests
(FAO, 2010b). This, however, does not necessarily represent a reduction or reversal in the
loss of forest biodiversity, as plantation forests are often monocultures with exotic species,
supporting less biodiversity than natural forests. They may also replace more biodiverse
habitats such as natural grasslands.

Marine fish stocks

Trends in world marine stocks provide an indication of marine biodiversity. The status of
marine fish stocks exploited by commercial capture fisheries gives cause for concern.
Since 1974, when monitoring of global fish stocks began, the proportion of fully exploited fish
stocks10 appears to have remained fairly constant, while the proportion of overexploited and
depleted stocks has increased (Figure 4.7). Today over 30% of stocks are over-exploited,
depleted, or recovering; around 50% are fully exploited; and less than 20% have the potential
for  further  development  (FAO, 2010a).  Depletion  of  commercial  fish  stocks  threatens
livelihoods and may affect entire ecosystems by altering food webs and population dynamics.

4. BIODIVERSITY

According to the Marine Living Planet Index,11 global marine biodiversity declined by
24%  from 1970  to 2007 (WWF, ZSL and GFN, 2010). In addition to over-exploitation,  the
drivers of this loss include fishing by-catch, habitat loss (e.g. due to coastal development),
pollution and climate change.

Biodiversity is in decline across each of the indicators described above. A broader,
more comprehensive assessment of state indicators for biodiversity is difficult as global
time series data are not readily available. Though indicator development has progressed
since the 2010 CBD biodiversity target was set in 2002, significant data gaps remain (especially
in developing countries – see Butchart et al., 2010 for an overview). Further work is needed to
identify data priorities and address them (see Section 4 for further discussion).

Biodiversity trends: Future projections

The Environmental Outlook Baseline scenario models the likely status (measured as MSA)
of terrestrial biodiversity in 2050 in the absence of new policy interventions. It assumes the
economic,  sectoral  and  social  trends  described  in  Chapter 2  (and  summarised  in
Annex 4.A). The Baseline scenario also serves as a reference against which future progress
and policy impacts can be assessed. Under the Baseline, total terrestrial MSA is projected to
further decline by approximately 10% between 2010 and 2050, with the majority of loss
occurring  before 2030  (Figure 4.8).  Looking  across  projections  in  specific  biomes,  the
steepest decline in MSA is projected in scrubland and savannah (19%), temperate forests
(19%) and tropical forests (14%). However, these projections are probably optimistic as they
do not take into consideration all the drivers of biodiversity loss (e.g. invasive alien species)
or ecosystem thresholds.

At the country group level (Figure 4.9), highest losses are projected for the rest of the
world (RoW) category (11%), although losses are similar for all the other groups of countries
(10%). However, as these groups are very different in total area, their relative share in global
loss differs much more. OECD countries (35 million km2) account for a relative share of 25%

(50 million km2) for 36% and the RoW (45 million km2) for 39%. The projected MSA loss
to 2050 in individual regions is particularly high in Japan and Korea (36% decline); Europe
(24%); Southern Africa (20%) and Indonesia (17%).

In the Baseline, global terrestrial biodiversity loss is driven by land-use change and
management; forestry; infrastructure, encroachment and fragmentation; climate change; and
pollution (e.g. nitrogen deposition). Table 4.1 describes these categories as modelled in this
Outlook (see Alkemade et al., 2009). Indirect drivers include population growth as well as
increases in GDP per capita, which leads to dietary changes and rising consumption. These
socio-economic drivers are discussed in detail in Chapter 2 and summarised in Annex 4.A.

To date, the main drivers of global terrestrial biodiversity loss have been land-use
change and management (i.e. conversion of natural ecosystems for producing food and
bioenergy  crops  and  livestock).  This  has  accounted  for  a  16%  decline  in  MSA  to  date
(relative to the pristine state). Infrastructure, encroachment and fragmentation account for
a 10% decline. According to the Baseline projections, these will remain key pressures on
biodiversity up to 2050 (Figure 4.10).

However, the relative contribution of pressures to further (additional) biodiversity loss
between 2010 and 2050 deviates from past trends (Figure 4.11). Overall, the relative impact
of  land-use  change  and  management  on  MSA  loss  is  projected  to  decrease.  While
expansion of food crop production and live-stock farming is projected to cause about half
of the further MSA loss in the RoW between 2010 and 2030, it is not projected to be a major
driver of further loss in the OECD countries or the BRIICS. Instead of agricultural land
expansion,  land  abandonment  is  projected  to  occur  in  several  regions,  allowing
considerable area for ecosystem recovery and regeneration to take place. These areas will
however bear the effects of “former land use” for several decades after land abandonment.

This pressure concerns effects on biodiversity that remain after land is abandoned from agricultural 
production. It is the consequence of slow recovery, and can be interpreted as biodiversity loss due to 
inertia effects.
The use of (semi-)natural and planted forests for wood production. Together these are referred to as 
forestry (but not deforestation, as that is included under land-use change). It encompasses different 
forest use/management types, i.e. selective logging or clear-cutting of semi-natural or natural forest 
systems; and production from plantations (planted forests with introduced species).
The following pressures have been aggregated:

Infrastructure: direct infrastructure effects due to noise, road kill, etc. Includes the effects of 
urbanisation.
Encroachment: loss due to poaching, wood gathering and other small-scale exploitation by people 
from settlements around infrastructure.
Fragmentation: the effects of cutting up natural areas into smaller areas by roads and by land-use 
change (conversion), thus affecting ecosystem connectivity and health.

Changes in biodiversity resulting from deposition of atmospheric nitrogen (e.g. eutrophication and 
acidification).
Pressure on biodiversity resulting from changes in climatic conditions, (e.g. temperature and rainfall), 
which can alter species distribution and ecosystem composition.

Forestry  is  projected  to  exert  increasing  pressure  on  biodiversity  across  all  three
country groups, accounting for close to 15% of global MSA loss between 2010 and 2030 and
30%  of  loss  between 2030  and 2050.  Bioenergy  crops  will  also  become  an  increasingly
important  pressure  worldwide,  particularly  in  the  RoW.  However,  in  the  Baseline,  the
worldwide  effect  of  bioenergy  production  is  still  modest  in  the  absence  of  ambitious
climate change policy in OECD and BRIICS regions (see Section 4).

Climate  change  is  projected  to  become  an  increasingly  important  pressure  in  the
Baseline, driving just over 40% of additional global MSA loss between 2010 and 2050.12 The
relative  contribution  to  future  biodiversity  loss  of  infrastructure,  encroachment  and
fragmentation is projected to diminish in the OECD and BRIICS countries between 2030
and 2050,  whereas it will increase in the RoW.  Nitrogen deposition is  projected to add
marginally to further MSA loss in the BRIICS to 2030 and in the RoW to 2050.

Looking more closely at projections in land cover and land-use change shows that
global forest cover is projected to decline by almost 1 million km2 between 2010 and 2020
(mainly due to conversion of land to agricultural production). However, it is projected to
then  increase  to 2050  as  a  result  of  natural  forest  regeneration,  reforestation  and
afforestation  (i.e. following  land  abandonment)  (Figure 4.12).  By 2050  forest  cover  is
projected to reach almost 40 million km2. However, this will not necessarily mean more
favourable conditions  for  forest biodiversity in every  region, as increasing demand for
wood and paper is projected to result in the expansion of forestry activities including wood

production from plantations. Primary forest (i.e. native forests where ecological processes
are not significantly disturbed) is projected to keep steadily decreasing (Figure 4.12). As a
consequence, the average biodiversity of forests will also diminish.

Of course, forest cover trends will differ between regions. Projected total forest area
declines to 2020 by nearly 200 000 km2 in both the OECD countries and the BRIICS, and
then  expands  to 2050  to  reach  a  greater  extent  than  in 2010,  mainly  on  abandoned
agricultural land. In the RoW, decline in forest area is projected to continue until 2030 with
a total loss of around 1 million km2 due to expansion of agriculture. After that, forest area
expands, but does not regain the 2010 level.

Under the Baseline scenario, the global area of production forests (forests managed for
the production of timber, pulp and paper, and fuelwood) is projected to increase by close to
60%  between 2010  and 2050,  to  a  total  of  15 million km2.13  Increases  in  the  area  of
production forests are projected to occur in all regions, except for the RoW (Figure 4.13), as
a result of steady increases in demands for timber, paper and fuelwood (although fuelwood
is projected to slowly be replaced by other energy sources).

Under the Environmental Outlook Baseline scenario, the land area in use for agricultural
crop  production  worldwide  is  projected  to  expand  between 2010  and 2030  by  about
1 million km2 (Figure 4.14).  Most  of  the  expansion  is  projected  in  the  RoW  group,  in
particular  Sub-Saharan  Africa.  After  peaking  (before 2030),  global  food  crop  area  is
projected to decline, particularly in North America, Brazil, Russia, South Asia and China.
This  is  based  on  the  assumptions  of  slowly  growing  populations  in  the  OECD  and  a
shrinking population in Russia and China, stabilising diets (i.e. maximum caloric intake
being  reached) in most  OECD  and  BRIICS  countries,  and increasing  crop yields  due to
technological improvements (for a further discussion of the agricultural land projections
under the Baseline scenario, see Chapter 2).

A similar trend is projected in the Baseline for areas designated for grazing and fodder
production (Figure 4.15). Between 1980 and 2010 global grazing and fodder areas expanded
considerably (2.5 million km2), mainly in the BRIICS. It is projected that global expansion will
continue until 2030 by another 1 million km2, after which time the total area is projected to

decrease.  In  Russia  and  China,  a  considerable  decline  in  grazing  area  is  projected  to
commence from 2010 onwards.

There are other important drivers of biodiversity loss which have not been modelled
here. These include invasive alien species, forest fires, other forms of pollution (such as
phosphorous) and over-exploitation of natural resources.14 The number of alien species in
Europe has increased by 76% since 1970, and similar trends are likely in the rest of the
world (Butchart et al., 2010). Invasive alien species15 can contribute to the loss of natural
resources,  reduction  in  food  production,  poor  human  health  and  increased  costs  for
agriculture, forestry, fisheries and water management (OECD, 2008b; SCBD, 2009a). This
increase is likely to continue over the next few decades, posing further risk to biodiversity.
For example, transport connected to trade and travel is expected to grow strongly in the
future – these have been the predominant agents for moving species outside their natural
ranges (e.g. ballast water used by ships, and seeds or animals carried on vehicles).

Over-harvesting, for example of trees (particularly in South America and Asia), marine
species, and bushmeat (e.g. in Central Africa), has already caused extinctions in the past
and remains a threat to biodiversity today. Given the growth in global population and in
demand for fish and wood products, as well as the jobs that depend on these resources,
managing them sustainably, and transforming those jobs into green jobs, are critical for
conservation of biodiversity in coming decades.

Impacts of biodiversity loss and linkages with climate change, water and health

Biodiversity  loss  can  have  severe  impacts  on  human  well-being,  security  and
economic  growth  (MA, 2005;  SCBD, 2010a;  TEEB, 2010a;  OECD, 2011a).  In  Canada,  for
example, over-exploitation led to the collapse of the North Atlantic cod fishery, resulting in
estimated short-term costs of USD 235 million in foregone income. In the long term, the
potential annual income foregone by not managing the cod fishery sustainably reached an
estimated USD 0.94 billion (cited in OECD, 2008a). Invasive alien species are estimated to
cost the US USD 120 billion per year in environmental damage and losses, and the global
economy more than USD 1.4 trillion (Pimentel et al., 2005; SCBD, 2010a).

Developing countries tend to bear the majority of the costs of biodiversity loss as they
are often more directly dependent on natural resources for economic development than
developed countries. Natural capital accounts for an estimated 26% of total wealth in low-
income  countries  compared  to  only  2%  in  OECD  countries  (World  Bank, 2006).  In
developing  countries,  natural  resources  play  a  key  role  in  the  economy  including  for
exports, employment and public revenues. Fisheries, for example, provide employment for
47 million fishermen (95% of the world’s fishermen) in developing countries and account
for  between  10 and  30%  of  government  budgets  in  several  countries.  In  developing
countries forestry provides formal employment for another 10 million people and informal
employment for 30-50 million, and can account for more than 10% of GDP (OECD, 2009a).
Eco-tourism  is  another  important  source  of  revenue  in  biodiversity-rich  developing
countries. In Namibia, for example, protected areas contribute 6% of GDP in tourism alone,
and in Rwanda, tourism in national parks protecting mountain gorillas is one of the largest
sources of foreign exchange, mobilising USD 42 million in 2007 (SCBD, 2009b).

Moreover,  biodiversity  loss  and  ecosystem  degradation  have  particularly  severe
implications for the rural poor. About 70% of the world’s poor live in rural areas and are
directly dependent on agriculture for their survival (World Bank, 2008). Forest resources
underpin the livelihoods of about 90% of the 1.2 billion people living in extreme poverty
(World Bank, 2004). Indigenous people are also often disproportionally adversely affected
by biodiversity loss and degradation. While richer groups of people may be able to respond
to loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services by purchasing alternatives, the poor may be
less able to do so.

The need for appropriate policies for biodiversity conservation and sustainable use is
even more important given the uncertainty surrounding the impacts of biodiversity and
ecosystem service loss, and the fact that damage to ecosystems can often be irreversible
(Box 4.2).

Biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation have other impacts, including on climate
change,  water  quantity  and  quality,  and  human  health.  Understanding  these  inter-
linkages and interactions can help policy makers identify potential policy synergies and
trade-offs, and thus enable more co-ordinated and strategic decision making.

Climate change

Biodiversity plays an important role in both climate change mitigation and adaptation.
Together, terrestrial and marine ecosystems are estimated to store 1 500-2 500 gigatonnes
(Gt) of carbon (Cao and Woodward, 1998; IPCC, 2001), and to provide a net yearly sink for
3.55 Gt of carbon dioxide (Dalal and Allen, 2008). On the other hand, deforestation and
other land-use changes account for up to 20% of global anthropogenic greenhouse gas

Box 4.2. Ecosystem thresholds: Avoiding irreversible decline through 

a precautionary approach

Most  environmental  policy  decisions  are  made  in  a  context  of  irreversibility  and
uncertainty. Ecosystems can only absorb pressure up to a certain threshold, beyond which
the basic integrity of the system is undermined. Where thresholds are crossed, a change in
the structure and function of an ecosystem may occur (SCBD, 2010a).

These changes are typically costly to reverse – if not impossible – and may have negative
environmental,  economic  and  social  consequences.  Eutrophication  of  marine  and
freshwater ecosystems, for example, has created “dead zones”, where decomposing algae
use up the oxygen in the water rendering it uninhabitable. This can be seen in the Baltic
Sea  and  Gulf  of  Mexico,  and  in  Lake  Erie  (Larsen, 2005;  Dybas, 2005).  Marine  trophic
cascades, where changes in the population of top predators have knock-down effects on
lower trophic levels, have also been documented. Over-fishing of predatory sharks at the
apex of the food chain in the Northwest Atlantic, for instance, is thought to have led to a
rise in the number of Cownose Ray, increasing predation on bay scallops and causing the
collapse of the scallop fishery (Myers et al., 2007).

The capacity of an ecosystem to absorb disturbance and re-organise itself so as to retain
essentially the same function, structure, identity and feedbacks is known as ecosystem
resilience (Walker et al., 2004). The combined and often synergistic  effects of different
perturbations can reduce ecosystem resilience, increasing the risk that thresholds will be
crossed. For example, biodiversity loss from overfishing, pollution or physical damage can
reduce  the  capacity  of  coral  reefs  to  absorb  changes  in  climate  and  ocean  acidity.
Conversely, conserving biodiversity insures ecosystems against functional decline: more
species with the same functional roles provide greater guarantees that some will maintain
the function even when others fail (Yachi and Loreau, 1999).

Thresholds are expected to be crossed more frequently in the coming decades as a result
of  increased  human  pressure  (SCBD, 2010a).  The  complex  non-linear  dynamics  of
ecosystems and their interactions with human systems make it difficult to predict where
thresholds lie, when they will be crossed and what the scale of impact will be (Groffman
et al., 2006;  Rockström  et al., 2009).  Given  this  uncertainty,  it  is  prudent  to  take  a
precautionary approach and keep disturbance well below likely thresholds. Some science-
based limits do exist (e.g. maximum sustainable yields in fisheries) and work is underway
to develop monitoring strategies and indicators to warn environmental managers and
policy makers when ecosystems may be approaching a threshold (e.g. the Indicator of
Coastal Eutrophication Potential; Billen and Garnier, 2007). However, further efforts are
needed (ten Brink et al., 2008; Paerl et al., 2003; Scheffer et al., 2009).

(GHG)  emissions  (IPCC, 2007).  Maintaining  and  restoring  ecosystems  (e.g. through
reforestation)  can  therefore  help  mitigate  GHG  emissions  and  increase  carbon
sequestration. It is estimated that the contribution of marine biodiversity alone to climate
regulation  may  be  as  much  as  USD 12.9 billion  annually  (Beaumont  et al.,  2006).
Biodiversity and ecosystems can also play an integral role in climate change adaptation.
Examples of “ecosystem-based adaptation” include maintaining and restoring “natural
infrastructure” such as mangroves, coral reefs and watershed vegetation that provide a
cost-effective  buffer  against  storm  surge,  rising  sea  levels  and  changing  precipitation
patterns (SCBD, 2009c).

174

4. BIODIVERSITY

Changes  in  temperature  and  precipitation  regimes  influence  the  distribution  of
species and ecosystems. As temperatures increase, ecosystems and species’ ranges tend to
shift towards the poles or to higher altitudes (Beckage et al., 2007; Salazar et al., 2007). This
migration causes some ecosystems to shrink and others to expand. Climate change also
alters ecosystem composition, structure and functioning, leading to an overall decline in
biodiversity,  and  disrupting  ecosystem  services  such  as  water  regulation,  carbon
sequestration  and  provisioning.  Moreover,  certain  climate  change  adaptation  and
mitigation  policies  may  exacerbate  the  adverse  impacts  on  biodiversity.  For  example,
agricultural adaptation approaches such as draining wetlands during times of flooding and
the use of dykes may cause habitat loss, soil erosion and eutrophication (Olsen, 2006).
Renewable energy sources such as biofuel, hydro-electric dams and wind turbines have
also  been  observed  to  have  negative  impacts  on  biodiversity  (OECD, 2008c;  The  Royal
Society, 2008; New and Xie, 2008; Everaert and Stienen, 2006). In addition to maximising
synergies and reducing trade-offs between climate change policies and biodiversity, efforts
should  be  made  to  enhance  the  adaptive  capacity  of  ecosystems  by,  for  example,
increasing ecosystem connectivity (see Section 3).

Water

The hydrological services provided by ecosystems include water purification, flow
regulation,  erosion  and  sedimentation  control  (Emerton and  Bos, 2004). Wetlands  and
forest soils are particularly effective at removing bacteria, microbes, excess nutrients, and
sediments.  Forest  soils  and  wetlands  generally  have  a  good  capacity  to  absorb  water,
releasing water gradually and reducing peak flows. In this way, peat bogs in Sri Lanka
provide  a  flood-buffering  service  estimated  at  USD 5 million  per  year  (Sudmeier-
Rieux, 2006). Forest soils and wetlands also serve as reservoirs of water during drought and
release water gradually, maintaining its flow.

Conversely,  impaired  water  quality  and  quantity  negatively  affects  biodiversity.
Eutrophication, habitat loss through land drainage, river flow regulation and sediment load
from soil erosion can cause declines in freshwater and marine biodiversity and changes in
ecosystem  structure  and  functioning.  Chapter 5 explains  the  impact  of  dams  on  the
balance  between  silicon  (sediments),  nitrogen  and  phosphate,  which  results  in
deteriorating water quality in coastal zones. Regional assessments in the United States, the
Mediterranean Basin and elsewhere indicate that freshwater species are, in general, at
much greater risk of extinction than terrestrial species (Smith and Darwall, 2006, Stein
et al., 2000). Indeed, the Environmental Outlook Baseline projections for MSA in freshwater
biomes show continuing declines to 2050, particularly in Africa, Latin America and some
Asian regions (Figure 4.16). This is likely to be an underestimation because the effects of
future  river  dams,  wetland  reclamation  and  climate  change  are  not  included  in  the
projections.

Human health

Biodiversity  and ecosystems  provide  services  which  are  critical  to  human  health.
These include basic human needs; preventing disease through biological control; medical
and  genetic  resources;  and  opportunities  for  recreational,  creative  and  therapeutic
activities for improved mental health (Zaghi et al., 2010) (see also Chapter 6).

Food provision is  an  essential service  that is both  delivered by  and dependent on
biodiversity. A biodiverse agricultural crop base is more resilient to drought, flood, pests

and disease, and reduces dependence on any one crop (COHAB Initiative, 2010; MA, 2005;
SCBD, 2009b). Reliable and diverse food sources reduce the risk of famine and also the
likelihood of micronutrient and vitamin deficiencies, which weaken the immune system.
Other provisioning services include clean air and water, and building materials.

Demand for these services, however, places considerable pressure on biodiversity. An
emphasis  on  increasing  the  output  and  standardisation  of  agriculture  and  livestock
farming systems, for instance, has tended to drive down genetic diversity (Heal et al., 2002).
In China, for example, the number of local rice varieties declined from 46 000 in the 1950s
to slightly more than 1 000 in 2006. In an estimated 60%-70% of areas where wild relatives
of rice used to grow, they are no longer found or the area where they are cultivated has
been dramatically reduced (SCBD, 2010a). Over-exploitation (e.g. of bushmeat for protein) is
also a significant concern.

Ecosystems with high biodiversity also ensure the regulation of interactions between
predators, prey, hosts, vectors and parasites and thus provide a mechanism for controlling
the emergence and spread of infectious diseases. Outbreaks of malaria, yellow fever, lyme
disease, avian influenza, and tick-borne encephalitis have all been attributed, among other
causes, to ecosystem degradation (Box 4.3).

Biodiversity  is  an  important  source  of  raw  materials  for  pharmaceuticals  and
biotechnology, and it provides medical models which can further understanding of human
physiology and mechanisms of disease. However, the demands of the health sector place
considerable pressure on biodiversity. It is estimated, for example, that more than two-

■ Globally, more than 50% of prescription drugs contain natural compounds derived from

■ The  incidence  of  malaria  is  linked  to  climate  change,  deforestation,  and  changes  in
aquatic ecosystems (Zaghi et al., 2010). In heavily deforested areas of the Amazon for
example, the human-biting rate of the primary malaria vector, Anopheles darlingi, may be
close  to  300 times  higher  than  in  intact  forests,  even  after  controlling  for  human
population density (Vittor et al., 2006).

thirds of the medicinal plants in use today are harvested from the wild and that 4 000-
10 000 of these may now be endangered (Hamilton, 2003). While international and national
laws  have  gone  some  way  to  reduce  unsustainable  harvesting,  illegal  markets  for
medicinal plant and animal species continue to encourage over-exploitation (Alves and
Rosa, 2007).

3. Biodiversity: The state of policy today

Policy frameworks for biodiversity conservation and sustainable use

Renewed efforts will be needed to conserve biodiversity and use natural resources
sustainably to reverse current and projected trends for biodiversity loss. As biodiversity
provides public benefits at local, regional and global scale, governments have a role to play
at  all  these  levels.  The  policy  instruments  available  for  biodiversity  conservation  and
sustainable use can be categorised as: regulatory (i.e. command-and-control) approaches,
economic instruments, and information and other instruments (Table 4.2). Each of these is
discussed in turn.

Regulatory approaches

Regulatory approaches for biodiversity conservation and sustainable use are common
in most countries. The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild
Fauna and Flora (CITES) regulates international trade in around 5 000 species of animals
and 28 000 species of plants to ensure that trade does not threaten their survival. Species
are subject to different trade restrictions according to the degree of protection they need
(CITES, 2011).

A cornerstone of most national biodiversity conservation policies and strategies is
protected  areas  (PAs).  In  the  European  Union  for  example,  Natura 2000  sites  protect

approximately 18% of European territory and 130 000 km2 of its seas (Natura 2000, 2011).
Globally,  terrestrial  PAs  cover  about  12.7%  of  the  Earth’s  area,  excluding  Antarctica
(c. 17 million km2)  (IUCN  and  UNEP,  2011a)  (Figure 4.17).  Some  biomes  are  better
represented than others however. For example, just under 30% of montane grasslands and
shrublands  and  more  than  40%  of  flooded  grasslands  and  savannas  are  protected,
compared to less than just 5% of temperate grasslands, savannas and shrublands (Coad
et al., 2009).

In contrast, there are still very few marine protected areas (MPAs) in place worldwide –
7.2% of territorial seas are currently covered (up to 12 nautical miles from coastline) (IUCN
and UNEP, 2011a), despite studies that show that MPAs can increase the density, diversity
and size of species (Halpern, 2003; Gaines et al., 2010). For example, within two years of
establishing no-take marine reserves in Australia’s Great Barrier Reef, there was a 57%-75%
increase  in  Coral  Trout  density in  six  of  eight  regions  assessed  (Russ et al., 2008).  One
shortcoming of existing MPAs is that they are often not big enough to protect adequate
habitat to support the target species; as a result their net benefit to marine ecosystems
may be minimal (Gaines et al., 2010). Increasing the size of MPAs and establishing networks
would help to address this.

Designing  networks  of  PAs  connected  by  natural  corridors  is  also  important  for
restoring,  maintaining  or  enhancing  ecological  coherence  and  the  natural  adaptive
capacity  of  ecosystems.  This  is  particularly  important  where  PAs  are  small  or  under
pressure,  and  in  the  context of  climate change  (Bennett  and Mulongoy, 2006). Where
ecosystems span political boundaries, maintaining connectivity may require co-ordination
among managers and scientists from neighbouring countries. As of 2007, 227 transboundary

PAs  had  been  established  globally,  combining  more  than  3 000 individual  PAs  or
internationally designated sites (UNEP-WCMC, 2008).16

Often, however, protected areas do not receive the level of protection intended,17 due
to poor management, inadequate monitoring and enforcement, and lack of funds. The
term “paper parks” has been used to describe PAs that have protective legislation but are in
fact open access. A global assessment of management effectiveness of 3 080 PAs indicated
an  average  management  effectiveness  score  of  0.53,  on  a  scale  from  zero  (extremely
ineffective management) to one (highly effective management). Approximately 14% of PAs
were considered to be lacking basic management requirements (Leverington et al., 2008).

In  establishing and managing PAs, governments should ensure  that  the  legal and
customary rights of indigenous people, local communities and other stakeholders are fully
respected, and consider the important role local and indigenous communities can play in
the management of PAs and as a source of local and traditional knowledge.

Environmental  standards  are  another  widely  adopted  regulatory  instrument  for
biodiversity. Standards come in a variety of forms, including quality standards (e.g. upper
limits on heavy metal concentrations in agricultural soils or water); quantity standards
(e.g. upper limits on number of daily grazing animals per hectare; maximum emissions of
pollutants);  and  design  standards  (e.g. commercial  fishing  net  specifications).  An
advantage of  quantity-based  standards  is that they are broadly applicable and  specify
biodiversity conservation and sustainable use goals explicitly. However, due to information
deficiencies and variations in abatement costs, standards may not always be cost-effective.
Furthermore, they may “lock-in” specific technologies.

In some cases a standard may not be sufficient and it may be necessary to ban an
activity completely (e.g. DDT18 use). Bans can also be implemented temporarily to relieve
pressure and provide an opportunity for ecosystem restoration. China, for example, has
introduced  an  annual  two-month  fishing  ban  on  the  entire  Pearl  River  system,
corresponding  to the start of  the peak spawning  season.  The purpose of  the ban  is  to
restore  fish  numbers  and  improve  water  quality  (Quanlin, 2011).  Bans  have  also  been

introduced where ecosystems are still intact but poorly understood, as a precaution. The
FAO’s General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean, for instance, introduced a ban
in 2005 on bottom trawling at depths beyond 1 000m (GFCM, 2005).

Other types of commonly used regulatory instruments include land-use  planning,
environmental impact assessments (EIA) and strategic environmental assessments (SEA).
The implementation of an EIA is a planning requirement in many countries. While legislation
and implementation vary from country-to-country, the procedural framework is the same.
EIAs are used by private and public-sector actors to identify, predict, evaluate and mitigate
effects  of  development  projects  prior  to  decision  making  (IAIA, 1999).  The  SEA  is  a
complementary approach used in higher tiers of planning and decision making to identify and
assess the environmental consequences and stakeholder concerns in the development of
policies, plans and programmes  (OECD, 2006).  There are opportunities to mainstream
biodiversity conservation and sustainable use into planning procedures by improving and
building upon the biodiversity criteria of EIAs and SEAs, which are often quite limited. The CBD
and OECD have established guidelines for achieving this (CBD, 2005; OECD, 2006).

Economic instruments

Environmental  taxes,  charges  and  fees  are  some  of  the  more  commonly  used
economic  instruments  for  managing  biodiversity  across  OECD  countries.  Examples  of
taxes which help prevent biodiversity loss include those on logging (e.g. British Columbia,
Canada), waste water discharge (e.g. Germany), groundwater extraction (e.g. Netherlands),
as  well  as  pesticide  and  fertiliser  taxes  (e.g. Denmark)  (OECD, 2008d;  Larsen, 2005).
Applications  of fees  and charges  include  fishing and  hunting (e.g. fees  for  commercial
marine fishing licenses in Canada and hunting licenses in Finland); development of natural
areas  (e.g. charges  for  development  of  coastal  areas  in  Korea);  water  supply  and  use
(e.g. charges on water supply and consumption in France); and admission fees to national
parks (e.g. in Israel).

Subsidies are one of the most commonly used economic instruments for biodiversity
conservation and sustainable use in OECD countries (OECD, 2008d). They come in several
forms,  including  monetary  payments, tax  exemptions  or  reductions,  soft loans  or  the
provision of infrastructure. They can be used to reward landowners for environmental
work  (e.g. for  restoring  degraded  forest  ecosystems  in  Korea);  for  removing  land  from
production  (e.g. Austria); for promoting eco-friendly  improvements in fishing gear and
practices (e.g. Mexico and  the  European  Union); for compensating farmers for  bans  on
fertiliser use  in  areas of conservation  importance (e.g. Czech Republic);  for  supporting
farmers  in  maintaining biodiverse farming  systems  (e.g. the  European Union);  and  for
supporting  the  development  of  conservation  parks  and  nature  trails  (e.g. Japan)
(OECD, 2008d). However, while subsidies can encourage biodiversity-friendly behaviour,
the downside is they may place a heavy burden on government coffers and taxpayers and
can stifle, rather than encourage, innovation. Where subsidy programmes are introduced,
they should be time-bound and closely monitored.

Payments  for ecosystem services  (PES)  are a rapidly emerging instrument used  to
reduce the loss or enhance the provision of ecosystem services. They are defined as “a
voluntary, conditional agreement between at least one ‘seller’ and one ‘buyer’ over a well-
defined  environmental  service –  or  a  land  use  presumed  to  produce  that  service”
(Wunder, 2005). For instance, downstream hydroelectric utilities that use clean water as an
input to production pay upstream forest managers to ensure a sustainable flow of this

180

4. BIODIVERSITY

service. PES can be potentially much more cost-effective than indirect payments or other
regulatory  approaches  used  for  environmental  objectives.  Examples  include  the
Tasmanian  Forest  Conservation  Fund  programme  in  Australia,  and  the  Sumberjaya
Watershed programme  in  Indonesia.  PES  schemes  can also mobilise finance  from  the
private sector – examples include the national PES programme in Costa Rica and Vittell’s
(Nestle Water) PES scheme in France (see OECD, 2010a). There are also international PES-
like schemes emerging that can benefit biodiversity, including REDD-plus,19 and payments
for Access and Benefits Sharing.20

Another emerging instrument is biodiversity offsets, which are conservation activities
designed to deliver measurable biodiversity benefits to compensate for losses caused by
project development, after appropriate prevention and mitigation measures have been taken.
Biodiversity offsets can operate in either a regulatory or voluntary framework. Brazil, Canada,
China, France, Mexico  and  South Africa,  among others,  have developed  guidelines or
incorporated biodiversity offsets into their legal framework, while several industry leaders
have voluntarily incorporated offset policies into their corporate strategy. These include Rio
Tinto, BHP Billiton, Anglo Platinum, and Shell (ten Kate et al., 2004; Treweek, 2009).

Biodiversity offsets may be carried out by the developer or contracted out to a third
party.  This  can  be  done as  an ad  hoc  arrangement or  within a biodiversity banking or
“biobanking” scheme. Biobanks serve as a repository of biodiversity credits representing
beneficial biodiversity outcomes beyond business as usual. The credits can be stored over
time and eventually purchased by developers to offset biodiversity loss at development
sites. Examples include the US Conservation Banking and the New South Wales Biobanking
programme in Australia.

Tradable permits are another instrument for creating biodiversity conservation and
sustainable use markets. In tradable permit schemes, the government sets a limit or cap on
user access to a resource. Access rights are then allocated to individual users who are able
to transfer or bank these permits according to their needs. Users who exceed the limits
imposed by their permit allocation are penalised. Tradable permit schemes relevant to
biodiversity  include  those  for  hunting  and  fishing –  the  latter are  often  referred  to  as
individual transferable quotas (ITQs). At least 120 fisheries worldwide have adopted ITQs.
Studies show that under a well-designed ITQ programme, fish stocks, and the profits from
harvesting them, have the potential to recover substantially (Costello et al., 2008).

Information and other instruments

Information  instruments  can  be  an  effective  way  of  addressing  informational
asymmetries that often exist between business, government and society. Eco-labels, for
example, inform consumers of the environmental impact of their purchasing decisions,
enabling them to make environmentally friendly choices. Eco-labelling and certification
have become popular in a  number of sectors, particularly agriculture (e.g. Roundtable on
Sustainable Palm Oil certification), fisheries (e.g. Marine Stewardship Council certification),
forestry (e.g. the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification Schemes), and tourism
(e.g. Green Globe Company Standard). It is important to note that there are limitations in
inducing change in consumer behaviour via information instruments alone. For example, a
recent OECD study of 10 000 households across 10 OECD countries indicated that consumers
are generally not willing to pay a premium of more than 15% for organic-certified food relative
to conventional food products, whatever the food category (OECD, 2011b).

4. BIODIVERSITY

Voluntary agreements are voluntary commitments to pursue actions that improve the
environment. They include unilateral commitments, which are programmes for improved
environmental  performance  set  up  by  firms  and  communicated  to  their  stakeholders
(e.g. the International Council for Metals and the Environment); public voluntary schemes,
where participating firms agree to standards that have been developed by public bodies
(e.g. the European Eco-Management and Auditing Scheme); and negotiated agreements,
which are contracts resulting from negotiations between public authorities and industry (e.g
“The Voluntary Initiative” which promotes responsible pesticide use in the United Kingdom)
(OECD, 2000). Green public procurement is another type of voluntary agreement whereby
public authorities use their purchasing power to choose environmentally friendly goods,
services  and works, thereby  contributing to sustainable consumption and production.
Voluntary agreements may be used in advance of and in supplement to legislation. They can
be used to experiment with new and innovative approaches, to promote awareness about
biodiversity issues, and to collect information and data. While generally the environmental
targets of most – but not all – voluntary programmes seem to have been met, care needs to
be taken to set goals that are sufficiently ambitious (OECD, 2003).

Selecting the appropriate policy mix: key considerations

A combination of command-and-control, economic and information instruments will
be required to address biodiversity loss and sustainable use. Selecting the appropriate mix
of  policy  instruments  to  address  biodiversity  conservation  and  sustainable  use  is  not
necessarily straightforward. It will require taking into account local and regional priorities
as well as international commitments under the CBD and other agreements. The policy
mix will depend not only on the nature of the environmental problem, but also the social,
cultural, political and economic context. Indeed, biodiversity policy may affect broader
national priorities, such as poverty alleviation, sustainable development and economic
growth, and these need to be considered in a coherent way so as to maximise synergies
and address any trade-offs. Policy coherence will also be required across countries in order
to  avoid “leakage”  effects –  where  increased  conservation  efforts  in  one  country  shift
pressures on biodiversity to another.

Under certain circumstances, regulatory approaches will be most appropriate. For
example, if an over-exploited fish stock is on the verge of collapse, a (temporary) ban on fishing
may be most effective. Economic instruments, however, are often able to achieve policy
objectives at a lower total cost than regulatory approaches, allowing greater flexibility for the
economic actor, and provide continuous incentives for improvement, thereby fostering
innovation. They also have the ability to generate revenues for government (OECD, 2011a).

While  some  policy  instruments  may  interact  synergistically  resulting  in  more
environmentally  and  cost-effective  outcomes,  other  combinations  may  be  counter-
productive or  simply redundant, serving only to increase the administrative costs. For
instance,  regulatory  standards  combined  with  voluntary  schemes  such  as  Forest
Stewardship  Council  certification  for  sustainably-sourced  timber  can  interact
synergistically by enforcing a minimum level of performance while encouraging industry
leaders  to  go  above  and  beyond  compliance.  However,  the  flexibility  of  economic
instruments  such  as  taxes  may  be  hampered  by  prescriptive  regulatory  instruments
addressing the same behaviour. Whether instruments interact synergistically or in conflict
will also depend largely on how they are designed (i.e. what and whom they are targeted to
address and at what regulatory scale) (OECD, 2007).

182

OECD ENVIRONMENTAL OUTLOOK TO 2050 © OECD 2012

4. BIODIVERSITY

It  is  also  important  to  consider  the  distribution  of  social  costs  and  benefits
(“distributional  impacts”)  associated  with  each  policy  option,  and  to  ensure  that
appropriate  measures  are  put  in  place  to  address  any  negative  effects  (OECD, 2008e).
Distributional impacts  occur  at different scales,  including between countries, regions,
sectors and groups in society. The costs of policies to maintain and enhance biodiversity
are  generally  borne  by  the  populations  living  in  the  area  where  these  policies  are
implemented. At the same time, many of the benefits generated by policies to maintain
and  enhance  biodiversity  are  delivered  elsewhere.  This  mismatch  between  costs  and
benefits also occurs at a global scale. As the majority of biodiversity is found in developing
countries, they are often burdened with the costs of biodiversity policies while a significant
proportion  of  the  benefits  accrue  worldwide.  International  financing  mechanisms  for
biodiversity can help to address this (see Section 4).

Finally,  biodiversity  policies  have  a  temporal  dimension.  Policies  not  only  affect
individuals today; they also affect future generations. The policy-making process therefore
needs  to  compare costs and  benefits  of  biodiversity-related  policies  that may  arise at
different points in time and justify them against some measure of intergenerational equity.

Recent progress 

Although the 2010 Biodiversity Target to “significantly reduce the rate of biodiversity
loss”  agreed  by  CBD Parties  in 2002  has  not  been  met,  there have  been some  areas of
progress since the last OECD Environmental Outlook (OECD, 2008b). At the international level,
there have been two important political achievements:

In October 2010 the 10th Conference of the Parties to the CBD (COP10) was held in Nagoya,
Aichi Prefecture, Japan. The Parties agreed on a new package, which includes the Strategic
Plan for Biodiversity, 2011–2020, the Aichi Biodiversity Targets (Boxes 4.4 and 4.5 and a Strategy
for Resource Mobilization. They also adopted the Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic
Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilization.21
■ The  approval  of  an  Intergovernmental  Science-Policy  Platform  on  Biodiversity  and
Ecosystem Services (IPBES) by the United Nations General Assembly in 2010 is intended
to  provide  an  interface  between  the  scientific  community  and  policy  makers.
Governments have agreed that the four main functions of the IPBES will be to i) identify
and prioritise key scientific information needed for policy makers and to catalyse efforts
to generate new knowledge; ii) perform regular and timely assessments of knowledge on
biodiversity  and  ecosystem  services  and  their  inter-linkages;  iii)  support  policy
formulation and implementation by identifying policy-relevant tools and methodologies;
and iv) prioritise key capacity-building needs to improve the science-policy interface, as
well as to provide and call for financial and other support for the highest-priority needs
related directly to its activities (IPBES, 2011).

At  the  national  level,  a  number  of  countries  have  made  progress  in  establishing
National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans (NBSAPs) as requested in Article 6 of the
CBD. Between 2008 and 2010, an additional 14 countries established NBSAPs (raising the
total to 171 countries or 89% of the CBD Parties) and 10 countries updated their existing
NBSAPs  (2nd  or  3rd  versions)  (Prip  et al., 2010).  CBD  Parties  will  now need  to  consider
revising and updating their  NBSAPs to reflect the Aichi  Biodiversity Targets (Target 17,
Box 4.4).

Box 4.4. The Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 and the 20 Aichi Biodiversity 

Targets

The strategic plan envisages that, “By 2050, biodiversity is valued, conserved, restored and wisely
used, maintaining ecosystem services, sustaining a healthy planet and delivering benefits essential
for all people”.

The mission of the new plan is to:

“… take effective and urgent action to halt the loss of biodiversity in order to ensure that by 2020
ecosystems are resilient and continue to provide essential services, thereby securing the planet’s
variety of life, and contributing to human well-being, and poverty eradication. To ensure this,
pressures  on  biodiversity  are  reduced,  ecosystems  are  restored,  biological  resources  are
sustainably used and benefits arising out of utilization of genetic resources are shared in a fair and
equitable  manner;  adequate  financial  resources  are  provided,  capacities  are  enhanced,
biodiversity issues and values mainstreamed, appropriate policies are effectively implemented,
and decision-making is based on sound science and the precautionary approach.”

The new plan consists of five strategic goals:

Strategic Goal A: Address the underlying causes of biodiversity loss by mainstreaming biodiversity
across government and society.

Strategic Goal B: Reduce the direct pressures on biodiversity and promote sustainable use.

Strategic Goal C: Improve the status of biodiversity by safeguarding ecosystems, species and genetic
diversity.

Strategic Goal D: Enhance the benefits to all from biodiversity and ecosystem services.

Strategic Goal E: Enhance implementation through participatory planning, knowledge management
and capacity building. 

Some examples of the Aichi Biodiversity Targets most relevant to this chapter are:

■ Target  2.  By 2020,  at  the  latest,  biodiversity  values  have  been  integrated  into  national  and  local
development and poverty reduction strategies and planning processes are being incorporated into
national accounting, as appropriate, and reporting systems.

■ Target 3. By 2020, at the latest, incentives, including subsidies, harmful to biodiversity are eliminated,
phased out or reformed in order to minimize or avoid negative impacts, and positive incentives for the
conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity are developed and applied, consistent and in
harmony with the convention and other relevant international obligations, taking into account
national socio economic conditions.

■ Target 5. By 2020, the rate of loss of all natural habitats, including forests, is at least halved and where

feasible brought close to zero, and degradation and fragmentation is significantly reduced.

■ Target 16. By 2015, the Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable
Sharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilization is in force and operational, consistent with national
legislation.

■ Target 17. By 2015 each Party has developed, adopted as a policy instrument, and has commenced
implementing an effective, participatory and updated national biodiversity strategy and action plan.

■ Target 20. By 2020, at the latest, the mobilisation of financial resources for effectively implementing
the  Strategic  Plan  for  Biodiversity 2011-2020 from  all  sources,  and  in  accordance  with  the
consolidated and agreed process in the Strategy for Resource Mobilization, should increase substantially
from the current levels. This target will be subject to changes contingent to resource needs
assessments to be developed and reported by Parties.

Recent years have also witnessed an increase in the cover of terrestrial and marine PAs
(see also Figure 4.17). Today, 12.7% of terrestrial area and 7.2% of territorial waters are
designated as protected (IUCN and UNEP, 2011a). Further progress will be required if CBD
Parties are to meet the Aichi Biodiversity Targets for PAs agreed upon at COP10 in Nagoya
(Box 4.5).

4. BIODIVERSITY

Box 4.5. What if… terrestrial protected area coverage expanded to 17% globally?
The Aichi Biodiversity Target 11 is to expand the global protected area network to at least 17% of
terrestrial areas by 2020. It specifies that the network should cover “areas of particular importance
for  biodiversity  and  ecosystem  services”  and  be  “ecologically  representative”  (Decision  X/2,
CBD, 2010). One way of achieving ecological representativeness is to apply a 17% target to each of
the major 65 ecoregions,1 rather than simply in terms of terrestrial area. A model-based simulation
was  run  to  implement  this  representation  (known  as  the  Expanded  Terrestrial  Protected  Areas
scenario, see Annex 4.A at the end of this chapter). This shows that the amount of additional land
that each country would need to set aside varies greatly (Figure 4.18). The largest effort would be
required from the BRIICS, both in terms of absolute area and as a percentage of the regional area,
especially Russia (14%) and India (10%). A substantial effort would also be required by OECD Europe
(10%).2  Relatively  lower  amounts  are  required  in  Southern  Africa,  Japan/Korea  and  Brazil.3
According to this “17% PA” scenario projection, establishing 17% of each ecoregion as PAs would
result  in  only  a  1%  decline  in  global  land  area  in  production  (0.5 million km2  of  around
40 million km2 for crops and grazing).

different degrees of enforcement.

There has also been some progress in securing public finance for biodiversity. Official
development  assistance  (ODA)  or  aid  for  biodiversity-related  activities22  given  to
developing  countries  by  donor  countries  (the  members  of  the  OECD’s  Development
Assistance  Committee)  increased  from  about  USD 3 billion  in 2005  to  USD 6.9 billion
in 2010 (Figure 4.19). As a percentage of total ODA, this has increased from about 2.5% in
2005  to  over  5%  in  2010.  Biodiversity-related  aid  with  the  principal  objective23  of
biodiversity  increased  from  about  USD 1.7 billion  to 2.6 billion  over  the  same  period
(OECD, 2010b).

Recent years have witnessed a substantial increase in climate change finance with
large  opportunities  to  harness  synergies  between  climate  change  mitigation  and
adaptation, and biodiversity. A well-designed mechanism for REDD-plus, in the context of
climate change mitigation, for example, could deliver substantial biodiversity co-benefits
since  avoiding  deforestation  and  degradation  should  protect  habitat  and  therefore
biodiversity (Karousakis, 2009). Commitments to REDD-plus for the “fast start” climate
finance period (i.e. 2010-2012) totalled around USD 4.3 billion in December 2010.24

Recent annual financial flows for climate change adaptation are estimated to be in the
order of USD 100 to USD 200 million per year (Haites, 2011; Corfee-Morlot et al., 2009), and
provide  opportunities for biodiversity conservation in the context of  ecosystem-based
adaptation. Colombia, for example, received a grant from the Global Environment Facility
and additional co-financing totalling close to USD 15 million to implement an Integrated
National Adaptation Plan in which ecosystem-based adaptation measures play an integral
role. These measures include restoring natural ecosystems in upper watersheds, along
riversides  and  in  landslide  areas.  These  have  been  developed  at  the  local  level
(27 completed as of 2010) and are incorporated into local and national policy making and
spatial planning (Andrade Pérez et al., 2011; World Bank, 2011).

4. Need for further action 

4. BIODIVERSITY

Despite the progress reviewed above, the scale of the biodiversity challenge means
that significant further efforts are needed at the local, national and international level.
Four overarching priorities for further action are:

i) Remove or reform environmentally harmful subsidies.

ii) Significantly  scale-up  private-sector  engagement  in  biodiversity  conservation  and
sustainable use, including via innovative financing mechanisms and the creation of
markets.

iii)

Improve data, metrics and indicators, including on the economic valuation of biodiversity.

iv) Mainstream and integrate biodiversity conservation and sustainable use into other policy

areas and sectors of the economy.

Removing or reforming environmentally harmful subsidies

One of the 20 Aichi Targets agreed at CBD COP10 is that, by 2020 at the latest, subsidies
harmful to biodiversity should be eliminated, phased out or reformed in order to minimise
or avoid negative impacts. Subsidies that can be harmful to biodiversity are those that
promote, without any environmental considerations, the intensification or geographic
expansion of economic sectors such as agriculture, bioenergy, fishing, forestry and transport.

Support to agricultural producers in OECD countries, for example, measured through
the producer support estimate (PSE), was estimated at USD 265 billion in 2008 (OECD, 2009b).
Though global trade liberalisation and domestic budgetary pressures have led to a move to
de-couple support from direct production (this type of support tends to be particularly
environmentally harmful), further progress is required to switch it towards supporting
environmental objectives for which there is a notional demand e.g. subsidising environmental
“public goods” and penalising damaging externalities. A recent example of subsidy reform
that reduces pressure on biodiversity is the abolition of subsidies for fertiliser in Korea
(OECD, 2008d).

Subsidies  to  fisheries  also merit further attention. Apart from natural cycles, fish
stocks are vulnerable to intensified fishing pressure as well as excessive fishing capacity
caused in large part by growing demand for food products and subsidies in a number of
countries.  The accelerating  depletion  of stocks, the  use  of  various forms  of  damaging
fishing gear, as well as emissions and pollution from fishing activities are undermining
marine biodiversity and ecosystem goods and services (which are much less understood
and quantified than terrestrial biodiversity). Overall, world capture fishery resources are
yielding negligible resource rents, with continuing investment in non-performing capital
assets (Arnason, 2008). Low yields are partly explained by substantial overcapacity in many
parts  of  the  global  fishing  fleet  and  lack  of  firmly-established  user/property  rights  in
fisheries  in  both  national  and  international  waters;  overcapacity  has  been  fuelled  by
subsidies to fishing. The reversal of this common resource management failure thus offers
a potential win-win, in terms of biodiversity recovery, as well as potentially large financial
savings on sub-optimal investment decisions (see ten Brink et al., 2010).

There is considerable debate over the full direct and indirect impacts of switching to
bioenergy. In many countries, the use of “first-generation” bioenergy (produced primarily
from food crops such as grains, sugar cane and vegetable oils) has had perverse outcomes
in terms of increased GHG emissions as a result of land conversion and soil disturbance. In

4. BIODIVERSITY

addition, there is currently little data on the ancillary costs and benefits for biodiversity.
The UK House of Commons Committee (2008) notes that the ambiguous savings arising
from the implementation of EU bioenergy support policies in the United Kingdom highlight
the  potential  risks  of  replacing  one  harmful  subsidy  with  another.  Doornbosch  and
Steenblik (2007) suggest that the rush to energy crops threatens to cause food shortages
and damage biodiversity with limited benefits. Moreover, there is some evidence to suggest
that  domestic  support  to  bioenergy  may  not  be  cost-effective  (OECD, 2008c).  Further
research into second-generation bioenergy (produced from cellulose, hemicelluloses or
lignin)25 might obviate some of the inherent trade-offs between energy, food (productivity)
and  biodiversity,  if  such  technologies  can  use  bio-wastes  arising  for  example  from
agriculture or forestry (see also Chapter 3).

Scaling up private-sector engagement in biodiversity

Given  the  trends  in  biodiversity  loss  and  the  large  levels  of  financing  needed
(see Section 1), there is an urgent need to better engage the private sector in biodiversity
conservation  and  sustainable  use.  Although  voluntary  private-sector  initiatives  for
biodiversity  are  beginning  to  emerge  (Box 4.6),  governments  will  need  to  do  more  to
provide the right incentives for the private sector to take action. These include clear price
signals for encouraging sustainable natural resource use and preventing pollution – they
must provide certainty while offering the private sector the flexibility to determine how
they can adhere to them most cost effectively. Though economic instruments are being
increasingly  applied  worldwide  (e.g. biodiversity  offsets  and  payments  for  ecosystem
services;  see Section 3),  in  most  cases  these  are  neither  sufficiently  stringent  nor
sufficiently comprehensive to address the scale of the biodiversity challenge. Governments
will  also  need  to  do  more  to  show  that  there  are  both  significant  business  risks  and

Box 4.6. Private-sector initiatives for biodiversity

World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD): this global partnership
has a membership of around 200 companies from more than 30 countries and 20 major
industrial sectors. The WBCSD provides a platform for companies to explore sustainable
development; share knowledge, experiences and best practices; and to advocate business
positions on these issues. Biodiversity is one of the key themes addressed by the WBSCD.
Recent  work  includes:  i)  the  Ecosystem  Evaluation  Initiative,  which  aims  to  promote
ecosystem valuation as a tool to inform and improve corporate decision making; and ii) the
Corporate Ecosystem Services Review, which provides guidelines for identifying business
risks and opportunities arising from ecosystem change.

Dow Chemicals  and  The  Nature  Conservancy:  this USD 10 million partnership was
announced in early 2011. Scientists from both organisations will apply a range of scientific
models, maps and analysis for biodiversity and ecosystem services to help Dow recognise,

intends to share the tools, lessons learned and results publicly and through peer review so
that  other  companies,  scientists  and  interested  parties  can  test  and  apply  them.  An
additional objective of the partnership is to help stimulate the emergence of biodiversity
markets and the adoption of market mechanisms for biodiversity conservation.

opportunities associated with biodiversity and ecosystem services and to encourage and
facilitate innovation (see e.g. OECD, 2009c; TEEB, 2010b).

Public finance will need to be complemented by and used to leverage private-sector
finance.  For  example, under  the  Green  Investment  Funds  scheme  in  the  Netherlands,
government  provides  beneficial  financial  arrangements  and  tax  reductions  to  private
investors to facilitate the implementation of green projects such as nature restoration in
drinking water production areas. Since 1995, around EUR 10 billion has been invested in
green projects through this scheme.

As biodiversity provides local, regional and global public good benefits, innovative
financing is needed at all these levels.26 Local and national policies need to be scaled up,
and instruments for international financing of biodiversity need to be developed – this is a
key  policy  gap.  For  example,  opportunities  for  international  co-financing  of  existing,
effective domestic biodiversity programmes could be explored. One example of where this
has been undertaken is in a recently established PES programme in the Los Negros Valley
in Bolivia. The programme involves payments for two ecosystem services simultaneously:
watershed  protection  and  bird  habitat.  While  downstream  irrigators  are  paying  local
farmers  for  watershed  services  (with  mainly  local  benefits),  the  US  Fish  and  Wildlife
Service is paying them for the protection of habitat for migratory bird species (Asquith
et al., 2008, cited in OECD, 2010a), which will have global benefits.

It is important to note that the development and scaling up of instruments to help
address  biodiversity  loss  and  degradation  need  to  be  supplemented  by  more
comprehensive and  transparent systems  to measure, report  and verify  financial flows
towards biodiversity. The OECD data on biodiversity-related bilateral ODA is a good starting
point  (see Section 3),  but  similar  information  is  required for national, multilateral and
private-sector finance. This would help to better identify where the largest financial gaps
are, and thus to help target biodiversity finance more effectively.

Improving knowledge and data for more effective biodiversity policy

Better  biodiversity metrics and indicators are an essential pre-requisite  for policy
interventions that are effective both environmentally and in terms of cost. Metrics and
indicators are critical to establish business-as-usual baselines, quantify benefits and target
biodiversity expenditures. They also enable the assessment of biodiversity performance
and hence the effectiveness of policy interventions over time. There is an urgent need to
further develop and improve biodiversity metrics and indicators for local, national and
international  use.  The  methodologies  applied  for  the  collection  and  reporting  of  data
should be as consistent as possible, so as to allow for the comparison of information both
within and between countries.

At the international level, one of the key applications of indicators is the assessment
of global biodiversity trends and progress towards the CBD biodiversity targets. However, as
indicated in Section 2, few of the headline indicators used to assess progress towards the
CBD  targets  are  available  at  global  level  and  over  time.  An  extended  framework  of
indicators  is  currently  under  consideration  to  assess  progress  towards  the 2020  Aichi
Biodiversity Targets. At the regional level, one of the more developed indicator initiatives is
the  European  Initiative  Streamlining  European  Biodiversity  Indicators  (SEBI)  for 2010,
which was established to assess and inform on progress towards the EU 2010 biodiversity
targets.  A  number  of  countries  have  developed,  or  are  in  the  process  of  developing,

complementary national indicator sets. The United Kingdom, for example, has published a
list of 18 indicators grouped under six focal areas that are aligned with those used in the
CBD and European biodiversity indicators (DEFRA, 2010). However, many countries will
need to build scientific and technical capacity, including for information sharing,27 in order
to better assess global biodiversity trends over time.

Metrics and indicators are also needed for the application of national, regional and
local biodiversity policies. As the benefits of biodiversity are not constant across space,
applying  metrics  that  account  for  geographic  variations  (e.g. to  enable  targeting  of
biodiversity areas with highest benefits), can increase the cost-effectiveness of a policy. In
addition to targeting areas with high biodiversity benefits, cost-effectiveness is enhanced
by targeting those areas where there is a high risk of biodiversity or ecosystem service loss,
or where its provision can be substantially enhanced. Finally, another consideration for
cost-effective policy outcomes is to target first those ecosystem service providers with
lowest opportunity costs. A number of methods as well as tools (such as spatial mapping)
are  increasingly  being  developed  and  applied  to  do  this.  Though  the  use  of  more
sophisticated targeting approaches can increase the costs of administering a programme,
the overall cost-effectiveness gains can increase substantially (see OECD, 2010a).

Another  area  where  data  could  be  improved  is  in  the  context  of  environmental-
economic accounting (or  green  accounting). The purpose  is  to  establish accounts that
reflect the depletion and degradation of natural assets, and that integrate information on
the  economy  and  the  environment  by  using  concepts,  definitions  and  classifications
consistent  with  the  System  of  National  Accounts  (SNA).  Environmental-economic
accounts  (EEA)  can  provide  policy  makers  with  coherent  indicators  and  statistics  to
support strategic planning and policy analysis. Several countries have explored or adopted
elements  of  EEA,  including  Australia,  Botswana,  Canada,  Germany,  Namibia,  the
Netherlands,  Norway,  and  the  Philippines  (World  Bank, 2006).  Practical  applications
generally focus on areas where the demand for accounting tools is clearly identified and
linked to specific  policy  questions – such as  the management and planning of natural
resources  and  materials  use  (e.g. water,  energy,  material  flows)  or  pollution  control
(emission accounts) – and the associated indicator development. Only a few countries have
established comprehensive accounts. Recent developments include:

■ work on ecosystem accounts and on the valuation of environmental services, including
the World Bank’s project on Wealth Accounting and the Valuation of Ecosystem Services
(WAVES) that  will support the  implementation  of natural  capital  accounting and  its
integration in the national economic accounting framework;

■ work by the European Environment Agency (EEA) on ecosystem accounts;

■ work in the United Kingdom to integrate natural capital into the UK economic accounts

and planning.

A  globally  recognised  framework  is  the  System  of  Integrated  Environmental  and

Economic Accounting (Box 4.7).

Despite providing essential direct and indirect services to all societies, biodiversity is often
given a low priority by decision makers. This is because its value is predominantly implicit
rather than explicit, and what cannot be quantified or is difficult to monitor and evaluate is
easy  to  ignore.  The  recent  study  on  The  Economics  of  Ecosystems  and  Biodiversity
(TEEB, 2010a and 2010b) made a strong case for integrating economics of biodiversity and
ecosystem services into decision making by national and local policy makers as well as by

Box 4.7. Environmental-economic accounting: The SEEA

The  System  of  Integrated  Environmental  and  Economic  Accounting  (SEEA)  was
developed in 1993 as a satellite to the System of National Accounts (SNA) and revised
in 2003. It aims to address the deficiencies of SNA in dealing with the stocks and flows of
natural resources. The SEEA comprises four categories of accounts: i) flow accounts for
pollution, energy and materials; ii) environmental protection and resource management
expenditure; iii) physical and monetary accounting of environmental assets; and iv) valuation
of non-market flow and environmentally adjusted aggregates. The SEEA is currently being
revised and comprises three volumes: i) the central framework consisting of agreed concepts,
definitions classifications, accounting rules and  tables;  ii) experimental accounts for
ecosystems; and iii) extensions and applications of the SEEA (forthcoming 2012/2013).

businesses. Proper economic valuation of biodiversity and its loss will lead to better, more
cost-effective decisions and can help avoid inappropriate trade-offs (OECD, 2002).

There are many applications of biodiversity and ecosystem service valuation. They
include  the  cost-benefit  analyses  of  policies  (e.g. those  of  US  federal  environmental
regulations);  determining  environmental  externality  costs  of  an  activity  for  use  in
investment  decisions  or  for  taxation  (e.g. the  EC’s  ExternE  Project);  undertaking  green
national  accounting  (e.g. The  European  Framework  for  Integrated  Environmental  and
Economic Accounting for Forests (IEEAF); and determining compensation payments for
natural resource damage (e.g. Natural Resource Damage Assessment in the United States)
(OECD, 2002).  More  generally,  valuation  is essential  for  raising  awareness  about  the
importance of biodiversity conservation and sustainable use.

A  number  of  initiatives  to  value  biodiversity  and  ecosystem  services  emerged
following the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA, 2005). The UK National Ecosystem
Assessment (NEA) is the first national scale assessment to be completed (Box 4.8) with
other  countries – including Spain,  Israel  and  the  United States – at  different  stages  of
developing similar assessments.

Box 4.8. Improving economic decision making for ecosystem goods

The UK’s National Ecosystem Assessment

In 2011, the United Kingdom completed an ambitious National Ecosystem Assessment
of how terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems across the United Kingdom have
changed over the past 60 years and how they might continue to change in the future. The
NEA quantifies the state and value of the natural environment and the services it provides
to society. It assesses policy and management options to ensure the integrity of natural
systems in the future, and help raise awareness of their central importance to human well-
being and economic prosperity. It provides a better basis for linking ecosystems to growth
objectives and will be used by the government to direct policy in the future.

Mainstreaming biodiversity into other policy areas

Related  to  each  of  the  three  priorities  identified  above  is  the  need  to  better
mainstream  and  integrate  biodiversity  into  broader  national  and  international  policy
objectives  in  other  sectors.  Policies  need  to  be  aligned  to  ensure  that  synergies  are
harnessed  and  potential  trade-offs  minimised.  One  example  in  the  context  of
environmental policy is the need to account for the inter-linkages between biodiversity and
climate change. As noted in Section 2, climate change is projected to play an increasing
role in biodiversity loss in the future. Mitigating climate change can therefore also lead to
significant biodiversity co-benefits (Box 4.9).

Box 4.9. What if… ambitious climate change mitigation is done in a way that also reduces 

biodiversity loss?

Under the Environmental Outlook Baseline, the concentration of greenhouse gases (GHG) in the atmosphere
is projected to continue to rise. The corresponding expected temperature increase of 2.4 oC above pre-
industrial  levels  by 2050  (uncertainty  range  2.0 oC-2.8 oC)  will  result  in  an  additional  MSA  loss  of
2.9 percentage  points  by 2050  (see Figure 4.10 above).  The  Environmental  Outlook  modelling  work  has
explored a 450 Core scenario, in which GHG concentrations are stabilised at 450 ppm CO2eq in order to limit
the global average temperature increase to 2 oC above pre-industrial levels by the end of the 21st century
with  a  50%  chance.  According  to  the  models,  this  would  reduce  MSA  loss  from  climate  change
between 2010 and 2050 to 1.4 percentage points (see Chapter 3 on climate change and its annex for further
information).

There are, however, a number of climate change mitigation options that can be adopted to reach this

target, some of which are more biodiversity-friendly than others:

In the 450 Core scenario, about 20% of total primary energy supply by 2050 is assumed to come from the
use  of  bioenergy,  requiring  a  total  of  3.1 million km2  of  bioenergy  cropland  (compared  to  only
0.9 million km2 in the Baseline). This increased land-use change would drive an additional 1.2 percentage
points of MSA loss, although the reduction in global average temperature increase would have positive
benefits for biodiversity. The net benefits for biodiversity from the combination of reduced climate
change  versus increased land use and other pressures would be a net gain of 0.1 percentage points
by 2050 compared to the Baseline (Figure 4.20). The gain would grow over time because of inertia in the
climate system, and also simply because the number of harvested bioenergy crops from a dedicated area
would increase over time, avoiding even more emissions (see Annex 4.A for more details).

■ Another way of achieving the 450 ppm target, while also preventing the expansion of agricultural areas
into natural ecosystems like forests, is explored in the  450 ppm + Reduced Land Use policy simulation
(see Annex 4.A for more details). This involved combining the 450 Core scenario with projections that
assume reduced agricultural expansion. Under this  simulation, crop area is projected to  decline by
1.2 million km2 and pastures by 1 million km2 by 2050 relative to the Baseline as a result of increases in
agricultural productivity. Under this approach, deforestation due to the level of agricultural expansion
projected in the Baseline could be completely avoided, reducing forest-related GHG emissions by 12.7GtC
in 2050, and delivering 7% of the required emission reduction effort by 2050. The combined biodiversity
benefit of climate change mitigation, reduced agricultural land use and other pressures is projected to be
an  MSA  gain  of  1.2 percentage  points  relative  to  the  Baseline  by 2050.  About  one-third  of  the  net
biodiversity gain would be realised in tropical and temperate forest biomes, and may thus be potentially
realised as a co-benefit from climate change mitigation, including REDD incentives.

Chapter 3 also describes a less ambitious 550 ppm mitigation scenario. Under the 550 Core scenario, bioenergy
is assumed to account for 13% of total primary energy supply by 2050. This corresponds to 2.2 million km2 of
bioenergy cropland. The net impact of all changed pressures on biodiversity under the 550 Core scenario would

Box 4.9. What if… ambitious climate change mitigation is done in a way that also reduces 

biodiversity loss? (cont.)

now result in a gain of 0.2 percentage points in MSA by 2050 compared to the Baseline. However, the long-term
improvement would be much less after 2050 and there would be a much higher global average temperature
than in the 450 Core scenario. Reducing bioenergy use even further in this scenario – to only 6.5% of total energy
use (the 550 Low Bioenergy scenario) – would lead to much greater net biodiversity benefits (1.3 percentage
points in MSA compared to the Baseline). Limiting the contribution from bioenergy will probably lead to
additional mitigation costs, strongly depending on the availability of alternatives (e.g. in transport).

These simulations (all depicted in Figure 4.20) emphasise the important trade-offs between climate policy, the
use of bioenergy, and land use and biodiversity policy. The exact values of the trade-offs are uncertain. First, the
negative impacts of bioenergy on biodiversity could potentially be minimised by reducing the extent of land-use
change. This might  be achieved by implementing higher-yield bioenergy production systems and  by
concentrating on bioenergy sources that do not require additional land (e.g. non-edible residues from
agriculture and the forest industry, and the organic parts of municipal solid waste). Further, bioenergy
production could be done on land with low biodiversity values (e.g. degraded soils), although this is likely to cost
more. Finally, it should be noted that the exact future climate change impacts on biodiversity are very uncertain
(due to uncertainty in climate responses to increased CO2 levels, the relationship between climate change and
biodiversity, and the indirect GHG emissions that can be attributed to bioenergy use). The results suggest a need
to closely monitor the impacts of increased bioenergy use on land-use changes and impacts on biodiversity so
as to improve the coherence between climate change and biodiversity policy.

This  examination  of  alternative  climate  change  mitigation  portfolios  shows  the  need  to  evaluate
environmental policies using integrated approaches that can highlight potential trade-offs and the delivery of
co-benefits between different policy objectives.

In addition to promoting synergies among different environmental objectives, it is critical
to also identify synergies and trade-offs that exist beyond the environmental agenda. In terms
of biodiversity conservation and employment synergies for example, investment in the
protection of biodiversity in a Mayan reserve in Guatemala generated annual earnings of close
to USD 50 million, creating 7 000 jobs and increasing the earning of local families (UNEP, 2010).
Many of the drivers of biodiversity and ecosystem service loss and degradation stem from
policies outside the auspices of environmental ministries. Mainstreaming and integrating
biodiversity objectives more broadly across national economic objectives is one element in the
broader pursuit of an effective green growth strategy (OECD, 2012); it is also fundamental to the
success of the CBD Strategic Plan 2011-2020 (CBD, 2010; see Strategic Goal A and Target 2 in
Box 4.4).

Mainstreaming of biodiversity will be realised through changes in policies, strategies,
plans, programmes and budgets. It will require a more consistent, co-ordinated and strategic
response to the multiple priorities faced by national governments, along with high-level
political commitment and stakeholder involvement. Core policy areas of relevance include
agriculture, urban development practices, transport, energy for biofuels, forestry and climate
change. A framework for developing a more comprehensive, integrated approach to tackling
the  challenge  of  biodiversity  and  ecosystem  service  loss  is  summarised  in  Box 4.10
(OECD, 2011c).

Box 4.10. A strategy for green growth and biodiversity

Key elements of a proposed green growth strategy for biodiversity entail the following:

i) Assess business-as-usual projections for biodiversity trends (taking into account population
growth,  economic  growth,  and  demand  for  agriculture  in  particular).  This  would  help  to
determine the reference point (or  Baseline) against which future progress could be assessed.
This process would serve to identify the key drivers of biodiversity loss and degradation and
where change is projected to occur most rapidly.

ii) Develop a long-term vision for green growth and biodiversity (e.g. developed by a joint high-
level task force and based on cost-benefit analysis). This would need to be undertaken in
co-ordination (and in tandem) with similar green growth efforts across other areas and sectors
of the economy, including agriculture, energy, climate change, and development. To foster
better co-ordination and collaboration between different ministries (environment, economics,
agriculture, energy, treasury, etc.), joint high-level task forces could be created to develop the
long-term vision in such a way as to capture available synergies and to address potential trade-
offs. To the extent possible, a long-term vision would be based on cost-benefit analysis.

iii)

iv)

Identify least-cost policy options and areas for intervention (to identify policy priorities and
sequencing).

Implement the strategy. This would involve selecting the appropriate instruments (regulatory,
economic and voluntary) from the policy toolbox and putting in place the policy instrument
mix needed to achieve the interim and long-term goals.

v) Monitor and review the strategy: track progress towards the goals, and revise approaches over

time to improve them, based on new information and lessons learned.

biodiversity targets.

3. The marine trophic index is based on data of global catch composition and indicates the mean

trophic level (position on the food chain) of fisheries catches.

4. For  a  description  of  the  GLOBIO  model  used  for  the  computation  of  mean  species  abundance,

see Annex A, Modelling Framework, at the end of this Environmental Outlook report.

5. Biomes  are  a  generalised  natural  ecosystem  type.  They  are  defined  by  soil  types  and  climate

conditions (Prentice et al., 1992).

6. This does not imply that there has been greater species loss in, for example, temperate forests as

tropical forests tend to be more species rich.

7. Several factors may account for the differences in species abundance estimated by the MSA and
LPI: The LPI only considers vertebrate species, whereas MSA comprises all species; in contrast to
the MSA, the LPI definition of a temperate zone includes the arctic polar and tundra regions; the
MSA indicator covers terrestrial systems, while the LPI covers terrestrial, marine and freshwater
biodiversity; the LPI uses the geometric mean, which makes it difficult to deal with extinctions
since the geometric mean can only be applied to positive values.

8. The index can be calculated for any set of species that has been assessed at least twice for the

IUCN Red List.

9. Forest cover, as defined by the FAO (FAO, 2010b), is forest land spanning more than 0.5 hectares
with trees higher than 5 metres and a canopy cover of more than 10%. It does not include land that
is predominantly under agricultural or urban land use.

10. Fully  exploited  means  the  fishery  is  operating  at  or  close  to  an  optimal  yield  level,  with  no

expected room for further expansion.

11. This index tracks changes in 2 023 populations of 636 species of fish, seabirds, marine turtles and

marine mammals found in temperate and tropical marine ecosystems.

12. See Alkemade et al., 2009 and Annex A to this Environmental Outlook on the Modelling Framework.

13. The rate of increase is probably an overestimation, due to data limitations on historical forest use.
In 2010, the total reported forest area in use for wood production was about one-third of the global
forest area according to  the FAO  (2010b).  However, in the  Baseline projections this level is  only
reached by 2050. This difference is most probably caused by the fact that most of the projected
forest  use  increase will  in  reality be  re-use of forest  that  has  already  been  logged  in previous
decades (pre-1970). There are however no long-term trends on forest use reported in FAO census
statistics (consecutive Forest Resource Assessments) that cover this historical period.

14. Invasive alien species and other forms of pollution are not included in the GLOBIO model used for
the Environmental Outlook, nor is marine over-exploitation. Terrestrial over-exploitation of natural
resources is partially and indirectly addressed under land-use and encroachment.

15. Invasive alien species are defined by the IUCN as “animals, plants or other organisms introduced
by man into places out of their natural range of distribution, where they become established and
disperse,  generating  a  negative  impact  on  the  local  ecosystem  and  species”  (IUCN, 2011).  An
example is the arrival of the Brown Tree Snake (Boiga irregularis) in Guam, which caused the near-
total extinction of native forest birds (ISSG, 2000).

16. The  Global  Transboundary  Conservation  Network  was  launched  at  the  Vth  IUCN  World  Parks
Congress  to  provide  expertise  and  guidance  on  all  aspects  of  transboundary  conservation
planning, management and governance. See www.tbpa.net/page.php?ndx=78.

17. The IUCN recognises seven categories of protected areas ranging from those where human activity
is  severely  restricted,  to  those  where  only  certain  aspects  of  the  natural  environment  are
prohibited from being altered. These categories recognise that protection and sustainable use are
complex objectives that have to be achieved in different ways to serve various social goals.

use worldwide, under the Stockholm Convention. DDT has been linked to poor human health and
declines in a number of bird species including the Bald Eagle and the Brown Pelican.

19. Reducing  emissions  from  deforestation  and  forest  degradation  (REDD)  is  a  new  financial
mechanism proposed for the post-2012 climate change regime under the auspices of the United
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). REDD was expanded to include
conservation, sustainable forest management, and enhancement of carbon stocks, as listed in the
Bali Action Plan (Decision 1/CP. 13), and is collectively referred to as REDD-plus.

20. One  role  of  the  Convention  on  Biological  Diversity  (CBD)  is  to  provide  countries  with  a  set  of
principles, obligations and responsibilities on how access to genetic resources can be provided and
benefits arising from use of such resources be shared.

21. The Nagoya Protocol is a commitment to attain prior-informed consent from the country of origin
before  accessing  genetic  resources  and  to  share  both  monetary  and  non-monetary  benefits
derived from genetic resource use, based on mutually agreed terms. 

22. “Biodiversity-related aid” refers to activities that contribute to at least one of the three objectives
of the CBD: i) conservation of biodiversity; ii) sustainable use of its components; and iii) fair and
equitable sharing of the benefits from the use of genetic resources.

23. Activities  that  are  considered  to  be  biodiversity-related  aid  can  be  scored  as  significant  or
principal. The activity will score “principal objective” only if it directly and explicitly aims to achieve
one of the three objectives of the CBD.

24. Norway  and  the  United  States  will  provide  almost  50%  of  this.  Six  countries –  Norway,  United
States, Japan, Germany,  United Kingdom, France –  account  for 88% of  the total  commitments,
while the remaining 12% is shared by 8 other sources (Simula, 2010).

ANNEX 4.A 

Modelling Background Information on Biodiversity

This annex provides further detail on the following modelling aspects:

■ a summary of the projected socio-economic developments behind the Baseline scenario;

the Expanded Terrestrial Protected Areas scenario;

the biodiversity impacts of different climate change mitigation scenarios.

Socio-economic developments in the Baseline scenario

The Environmental Outlook Baseline scenario makes projections of a number of socio-
economic developments outlined below (and further discussed in Chapters 1 and 2), and
these in turn were used to construct the Baseline projections on biodiversity-related issues
discussed in this chapter:

■ World GDP is projected to nearly quadruple over the coming four decades, in line with
the  past  40 years  and  based  on  detailed  projections  on  the  main  drivers  of  economic
growth. By 2050, the OECD’s share of the global economy is assumed to decline from 54%
in 2010 to less than 32%, while the share of Brazil, Russia, India, Indonesia, China and
South Africa (BRIICS) is assumed to grow to more than 40%.

■ By 2050, the world is assumed to add over 2.2 billion people to the current 7 billion. All
world regions are assumed to be facing population ageing but will be at different stages
of this demographic transition.

■ By 2050, nearly 70% of the world’s population is assumed to be living in urban areas.

■ World  energy  demand  is  assumed  to  be  80%  higher  in 2050  under  current  policies.
The 2050 global energy mix is assumed to be fairly similar to that of today, with the share
of fossil energy still at about 85% (of commercial energy), renewables including biofuels
(but  excluding  traditional  biomass)  just  above  10%,  and  the  balance  being  nuclear.
Among  fossil  fuels,  it  is  uncertain  whether  coal  or  gas  will  be  the  main  source  of
increased energy supply.

■ Globally, the area of agricultural land is assumed to expand in the next decade, but at a
slower  rate.  It  is  assumed  to  peak  before 2030  to  match  the  increase  in  food  demand
from a growing population, and decline thereafter, as population growth slows down and
yield improvements continue. Deforestation rates are already declining, and this trend is
assumed  to  continue,  especially  after 2030  with  demand  for  more  agricultural  land
easing (Section 3, Chapter 2).

The Expanded Terrestrial Protected Areas scenario

4. BIODIVERSITY

For  the  Expanded  Terrestrial  Protected  Areas  scenario  (Box 4.5 in  main  text),  a  geo-
explicit network of protected areas (PAs) was designed, consistent with the new CBD target
of 17% PAs by 2020, with a representative cover of global ecosystem types (ecoregions).

A map with current PAs served as a starting point (IUCN and UNEP, 2011b). To date, a
total of about 19 million km2 of terrestrial area is reported to have protected status (IUCN and
UNEP, 2011; Coad et al., 2009). However, due to spatial inaccuracies, only 15.6 million km2 could
be taken into account for this simulation (12%).

Newly protected areas were selected, based on the following criteria:

■ Ecoregions are implemented as a combination of bio-geographic realms and major biome
types  (Olsen  et al., 2001),  giving  a  total  of  65.  The  assumption  is  that  the  65 ecoregions
sufficiently distinguish between the different ecosystem and species types found globally to
attain  a  representative  situation.  A  further  spatial  disaggregation  (for  instance  using  the
200 WWF ecoregions) could not be performed due to (spatial) data limitations. New areas
were added until the 17% area criterion was reached for each ecoregion.

■ Preference  was  given  to  those  parts  of  an  ecoregion  that  present  “hotspot”  areas  for
biodiversity. Selection of biodiversity-rich areas can be done for different species groups and
purposes, and therefore such selection always involves some degree of subjectivity (Brooks
et al., 2006).  A  UNEP-WCMC  map  was  used  that  combines  several  indicators  to  select
biodiversity-rich  areas  (Kapos  et al.,  2008).  The  following  biodiversity  indicators  are
included in the UNEP-WCMC overlay (see Figure 4.A1): Birdlife International’s endemic
bird areas; amphibian diversity areas, WWF’s Global 200 terrestrial ecoregions, Conservation
International’s biodiversity hotspots and WWF/IUCN’s centres of plant diversity.

■ When necessary, preference was given to those cells that are nearest to agricultural land.

These areas probably receive the largest threat from agricultural expansion.

Representativeness of global ecosystem types (ecoregions) and hotspots is the prime
criterion for this gap analysis, and not the absolute number of species, or species richness.
This  is  in  accordance  with  the  CBD  target,  and  indicators  reported  in  the  Global
Biodiversity Outlook 3 (SCBD, 2010a).

With the 17% maps, the land-supply curves for LEITAP were adapted to account for the
restrictions on the amount of land available for agriculture given the increase in PA cover
(Eickhout et al., 2006). The LEITAP outcomes for regional agricultural production were fed
into IMAGE-GLOBIO to calculate the effects of introducing a 17% PA-map on the pressures
that influence MSA (mostly changed land use for this simulation). 

The biodiversity impacts of climate change mitigation under the 450 and 550 Core 
scenarios and the 550 Low Bioenergy scenario 

Climate change is projected to play an increasingly important role in biodiversity loss
in the future. Climate change mitigation could help achieve the goals of both the climate
change and biodiversity conventions. Climate change is related to biodiversity in several
ways. It affects ecosystems through changed meteorological conditions (precipitation and
temperatures)  that  alter  the  living  environment  of  species.  As  a  consequence,  species
abundances  will  change,  and  species  may  even  disappear  from  certain  regions.  In
analysing potential synergies and trade-offs between these policy areas, it is important to
take  possible  land-use  changes  from  climate  change  mitigation  efforts  into  account,  as
land-use change has been the most important driver for historical biodiversity loss. The
most  relevant  land-use  changes  in  climate  policy  measures  may  come  from  bioenergy,
(avoiding) deforestation (REDD) and reforestation.

The role of bioenergy 

Most mitigation scenarios identify bioenergy as an important element of the climate
policy portfolio. Bioenergy can be an attractive alternative for oil in transport, can be used
as  feedstock  in  power  and  hydrogen  production  and  can  also  be  combined  with  carbon
capture  and  storage  in  power  and  hydrogen  production  in  order  to  create  negative
emissions (van Vuuren et al., 2010). Several studies have indicated the potential downsides
and  risks  of  bioenergy  use  because  of  the  vast  areas  of  land  required  for  bioenergy
production  (either  directly  or  indirectly),  that  may  lead  to  considerable  loss  of  natural
ecosystems  with  consequences  for  biodiversity  and  carbon  (Sala  et al., 2009;  ten  Brink
et al., 2010). It may also lead to increased food prices. Quantitative assessment of negative
and positive effects of bioenergy could shed more light on the exact trade-offs of different
bioenergy policies.

In each of the core climate change mitigation simulations, bioenergy use is based on
constructing  a  cost-effective  portfolio  of  mitigation  options  that  meets  the  targeted
concentration  pathway  (see the  Annex  to  Chapter 3).  In  the  biodiversity  chapter,  these
scenarios  are  used  to  examine  the  effects  of  climate  change  mitigation  on  biodiversity
(Box 4.9).  The  scenarios  used  are  the  450  and  550 Core  scenarios.  These  scenarios  use
mostly woody bioenergy and residues. The total use of bioenergy is respectively 20% and
13% of total primary energy supply (TPES). In addition, a sensitivity analysis was carried
out on the 550 Core portfolio, which assumes lower levels of bioenergy use (low-bioenergy
case).  In  all  calculations,  it  is  assumed  that  bioenergy  is  produced  on  abandoned
agricultural land and, to some extent, on natural grasslands. Protected areas are excluded
from bioenergy production.

204

OECD ENVIRONMENTAL OUTLOOK TO 2050 © OECD 2012

4. BIODIVERSITY

In  the  550 ppm  low-bioenergy  case,  the  use  of  bioenergy  on  natural  grasslands  has
been  excluded  altogether.  Moreover,  more  strict  sustainability  criteria  have  been
introduced that do not allow for bioenergy production in water scarce areas and severely
degraded areas. Finally, compared to the 550 Core simulation, short-term bioenergy targets
that  stimulate  technology  development  for  bioenergy  technologies  have  been  removed.
These restrictions lead to a bioenergy use of 6.5% of TPES.

The biodiversity impacts of climate change mitigation under a 450 ppm + Reduced 
Land Use scenario

In IMAGE, the most important driver of deforestation and loss of natural grasslands is
the  expansion  of  agricultural  land  use.  The  model  projects  for  the 2010-2030 period,
globally, a net loss of natural area, including forests, as a result of the increased land use
for food and bioenergy production. Clearly, avoiding expansion of agricultural areas into
natural ecosystems like forests reduces greenhouse gas emissions and biodiversity loss.
The option of Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD) provides an
example  of  a  policy  that  aims  to  use  this  potential.  Studies  show  that  avoiding  CO2
emissions through REDD is a relatively low-cost option (Kindermann et al., 2008), especially
in  developing  countries.  Given  the  high  carbon  price  in  ambitious  climate  scenarios
considered in this report, the implementation of REDD measures is very attractive.

As  a  sensitivity  study,  to  explore  the  potential  of  a  Reduced  Land  Use  scenario,  the
450 Core  climate  mitigation  scenario  was  combined  with  projections  on  improving
agricultural yields with the aim to avoid further expansion of agricultural area (food, feed
and fuel) beyond 2020 (Box 4.9). The level of agricultural yield improvement depends on the
expansion of agricultural area in the Baseline scenario and thus differs per region and crop
(the  highest  improvements  occur  in  the  African  region).  The  global  average  yield  in
the 2020-2030 period  is  3-18%  higher  (than  the  Baseline)  depending  on  the  crop  (highest
numbers for crops grown mostly in the African region). Under this 450 ppm + Reduced Land
Use policy simulation, crop area is projected to decline by 1.2 million km2 and pastures by
1 million km2  by 2050  compared  to  the  Baseline  as  a  result  of  increases  in  agricultural
productivity. This totally avoids the loss of forests and other natural ecosystems through
expansion of natural areas. For forests, studies suggest that this could be implemented and
financed through policies like REDD. For other ecosystems, this is less straightforward –
although  studies  indicate  that  some  of  these  ecosystems  might  also  store  considerable
amounts of carbon and/or have high biodiversity value.

Around the world, cities, farmers, industries, energy suppliers, and ecosystems are
increasingly  competing  for  their  daily  water  needs.  Without  proper  water
management, the costs of this situation can be high – not just financially, but also
in terms of lost opportunities, compromised health and environmental damage.
Without  major  policy  changes  and  considerable  improvements  in  water
management, by 2050 the situation is likely to deteriorate, increasing uncertainty
about water availability. This chapter summarises the key pressures on water, as
well as the main policy responses. It starts by looking at current water challenges
and  trends  and  how  they  could  affect  the  water  outlook  in 2050.  It  considers
competing  demands for water (from agriculture/irrigation,  industry,  electricity,
domestic/urban supply, environment flows) and over-exploitation (both surface and
groundwater), water stress, water-related disasters (e.g. floods), water pollution (in
particular nutrient effluents – nitrogen and phosphorus – from agriculture and
wastewater) and discharge into the seas, and lack of access to water supply and
sanitation (as defined by the Millennium Development Goals or MDGs). It reviews
the existing policy tools to manage water (such as water rights, water pricing), and
explores how the water outlook could be improved by more ambitious policies. The
chapter discusses emerging issues in water policy; it pays particular attention to
water as a driver of green growth, the water-energy-food nexus, allocating water for
healthy  ecosystems,  and  alternative  sources  of  water  (reuse).  For  all  these,
governance,  the  use  of  economic  instruments,  investment  and  infrastructure
development are important dimensions. They all contribute to and facilitate water
policy reforms in OECD countries and globally.

5. WATER

KEY MESSAGES

Access to clean water is fundamental to human well-being. Managing water to meet that need is a

major – and growing – challenge in many parts of the world. Many people are suffering from inadequate
quantity and quality of water, as well as stress from floods and droughts. This has implications for health,
the  environment  and  economic  development.  Without  major  policy  changes  and  considerable
improvements  in  water  management  processes  and  techniques, by 2050  the  situation  is likely  to
deteriorate, and will be compounded by increasing competition for water and increasing uncertainty
about water availability.

Trends and projections
Water quantity

The  Outlook  Baseline  scenario  projects  that  by 2050,  3.9 billion  people,  over  40%  of  the  world’s
population, are likely to be living in river basins under severe water stress.

Water demand  is  projected  to  increase  by  55%  globally  between 2000  and 2050.  The  increase  in
demand will come mainly from manufacturing (+400%), electricity (+140%) and domestic use (+130%).
In the face of these competing demands, there will be little scope for increasing water for irrigation.

In many regions of the world, groundwater is being exploited faster than it can be replenished and is
also  becoming  increasingly  polluted.  The  rate  of  groundwater  depletion  more  than  doubled
between 1960 and 2000, reaching over 280 km3 per year.

Water quality

Continued  efficiency  improvements  in  agriculture  and  investments  in  wastewater  treatment  in
developed countries are expected to stabilise and restore surface water and groundwater quality in
most OECD countries by 2050.
The quality of surface water outside the OECD is expected to deteriorate in the coming decades,
through nutrient flows from agriculture and poor wastewater treatment. The consequences will be
increased eutrophication, biodiversity loss and disease. For example, the number of lakes at risk of
harmful algal blooms will increase by 20% in the first half of this century. 
Micro-pollutants  (medicines,  cosmetics,  cleaning  agents,  and  biocide residues)  are  an  emerging
concern in many countries.

Water supply and sanitation

The number of people with access to an improved water source increased by 1.8 billion between 1990
and 2008, mostly in the BRIICS group (Brazil, Russia, India, Indonesia, China and South Africa), and
especially in China.
More than 240 million people (most of them in rural areas) are expected to be without access to an
improved water source by 2050. The Millennium Development Goal for improved water supply is
unlikely  to  be met  in  Sub-Saharan  Africa.  Globally, more  city  dwellers  did  not have access  to  an
improved water source in 2008 than in 1990, as urbanisation is currently outpacing connections to
water infrastructure. The situation is even more daunting given that access  to an improved water
source does not always mean access to safe water.
Almost 1.4 billion people are projected to still be without access to basic sanitation in 2050, mostly in
developing countries. The Millennium Development Goal on sanitation will not be met.

Water-related disasters

Today,  100-200 million  people  per  year  are victims  of  floods,  droughts  and  other  water-related
disasters (affected or killed); almost two-thirds are attributed to floods. The number of people at risk
from floods is projected to rise from 1.2 billion today to around 1.6 billion in 2050 (nearly 20% of the
world’s population). The economic value of assets at risk is expected to be around USD 45 trillion
by 2050, a growth of over 340% from 2010.

Policy options and needs
Create incentives for water efficiency

Improve water pricing to signal scarcity and to create incentives for efficient water use in all sectors
(e.g. agriculture,  industry,  domestic);  address  social  consequences  through  well-designed  tariff
structures or targeted measures. Combine multiple policy instruments to curb water demand and make
alternative water sources (such as reusing treated wastewater) competitive.
Implement flexible water allocation mechanisms (e.g. by combining water rights reform and pricing
policies).

will be needed; the private sector is an important player.

Improve and increase the use of appropriate wastewater treatment equipment and techniques, and the
efficient management of nutrients and agricultural run-off. Encourage further R&D to speed up and
disseminate innovation in developed and developing countries. Build capacity in target economies
(essentially farmers), through training and education.

Invest in green infrastructure

Invest in innovative water storage capacities which do not conflict with other environmental policy
objectives (e.g. preservation of ecosystem services, forests or biodiversity).

■ Reduce the impact and occurrence of water–related disasters by restoring the ecosystem functions of
floodplains  and  wetlands,  paying  attention  to  hydromorphology  and  removing  incentives  which
encourage people to settle or invest in risk-prone areas.

■ Accelerate  the  deployment  of  water  supply  and  sanitation  infrastructure  in  developing  countries.
Explore innovative options which consume less water, energy or capital. This can be funded partially by
OECD member states, e.g. by increasing the portion of official aid to these areas, and the private sector
can also play an essential role.

Ensure policy coherence

Improve water governance to ensure coherence with other policy areas such as energy, agriculture and
urban planning. Engage all relevant stakeholders (different levels of government, water user groups,
private companies). Ensure appropriate governance to prevent tensions over transboundary waters.

■ Assess and reform subsidies that encourage unsustainable water use, and ensure coherence between

water policy objectives and initiatives in other sectors (including energy and agriculture).

Fill in information gaps

Invest in better water-related information (e.g. on consumption, irrigation, and the impact of climate
change on water resources).

1. Introduction

Around the world, individuals, farmers, industries, and ecosystems are increasingly
competing for their  daily water needs.  Without  proper  management, the costs of this
situation  can  be  high –  not  just  financially,  but  also  in  terms  of  lost  opportunities,
compromised health and environmental damage.

This  chapter  summarises  the  key  pressures  on  water,  as  well  as  the  main  policy
responses. The chapter starts by looking at current water challenges and trends – how
competing demands and over-exploitation, water-related disasters, poor water quality and
lack  of  access  to  water  supply  and  sanitation  services  could  affect  the  water  outlook
in 2050. It then reviews the existing policy toolbox, and presents a few more ambitious
policy scenarios1 building on OECD data (where available) and models to explore how the
water outlook could be improved. This leads to a discussion of the actions that need to be
taken now by national governments, the international community and the private sector.

Key drivers of water health

What processes are affecting the quantity and quality of our water systems? This
section briefly outlines the main drivers, followed by summarising the key policy responses
(developed more fully in Section 4). The state of water systems is affected by both human
activities and environmental change. Today the key human drivers include population,
income growth and economic activities (see Chapter 2, on socio-economic developments).
To  date,  economic  growth  and  population  dynamics  have  affected  water  more  than
climate.  However,  after 2050,  climate  change  is  expected  to  become  a  major  driver
(see Box 5.3 for an illustration, and Annex 5.A).2

Population  growth  and  lifestyle  changes  drive  household  water  demand  and  the
release of pollutants into water bodies. Projections discussed in Chapter 2 anticipate that
global  population  will  continue  to  grow  until 2050,  albeit  at  a  slower  pace,  mainly  in
developing countries and particularly in West Africa.

Growth  in  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  drives  agricultural  and  industrial  water
demand  and  water  pollution  discharges,  as  well  as  water  demand  for  electricity
generation. Agriculture deserves  particular attention: production will need to  increase
significantly by 2050 to meet the growing demand for food. Agriculture has an impact on
both water availability (by altering run-off and competing with other uses for surface and
groundwater)  and  quality  (through  the  release  of  nutrients  and  micro-pollutants  into
surface water and groundwater). Different types of energy sources also affect the quality
and quantity of water available for other uses. Increasing energy demand and shifting
energy mixes have to be factored into water management.

Urbanisation drives water supply and sanitation needs. On the one hand, urbanisation
lowers the per-capita costs of connection to water infrastructure. On the other hand, as city
dwellers become more numerous, they require more investment to connect to water and

wastewater infrastructure. The situation is particularly complex in slums. Urbanisation
also drives the need for flood control infrastructure: sealed surfaces alter run-offs from
rain and storm water, impair the recharge of underground aquifers and increase flood
risks.

Policy responses: A summary

Governments and the private sector must co-ordinate and act urgently to address the
water-related challenges we are already facing. Additional action will be needed to address
future water stress and the emerging challenges described in the next sections.

The Environmental Outlook models show that incremental improvements in water use
efficiency will not be  enough (see Section 3 Policy: current and  future  scenarios).  Even
radical  changes  in  the  efficiency  of  current  uses  may  not  be  enough  to  avoid  a  more
fundamental  appraisal  of  the  allocation  of  water. Rapidly  growing  water  demands  for
electricity production, industry and urban supply are likely to come into increasingly acute
competition  with  agriculture  for  available  water  in  the  coming  decades.  As  described
below, OECD governments are gaining experience with innovative approaches to water
allocation (such  as  tradable water rights, smart metering),  water  reuse, or  sustainable
water pricing (which includes abstraction charges or licences that reflect scarcity). More
needs to be done to properly assess and scale up the use of some of these instruments, to
secure environmental values while meeting social and economic needs.

Some of the required policy responses will make claims on public spending. But in the
current context of fiscal consolidation, the extent of such claims need to be backed by
robust valuation of benefits, the exploration of alternative financing schemes, and a search
for low-cost options.

Innovation  has  a  major  role  to  play  in  promoting  sustainable  water  resource
management. This includes (but is not limited to) technologies. Examples include efficient
irrigation  systems and  ecological  farming  techniques  to  reduce  fertiliser run-off,  crop
research, water treatment technologies such as membranes and filtration techniques, and
advanced  wastewater  treatment.  Technologies  need  to  be  supported  by  innovative
business models and corresponding regulatory regimes to improve water management,
and to integrate water priorities into other policy areas such as energy, food, and spatial
planning.  Developing  an  inventory  and  improving  the  valuation  of  hydrological
ecosystems services can pave the way to greater use of innovative, ecologically-based and
low-cost approaches to address some of the challenges identified here. Water purification,
flow regulation, erosion and sedimentation control, and restoration of hydromorphology
all  have  a  role  to  play, together  with  new  techniques  being  developed  to  improve  the
collection, processing and presentation of data that support both policy-making and water
operations.

In the search for innovative technologies and business models, the private sector has
a pivotal role to play. This includes the water industry, the financial sector (which may
realise water-related investment opportunities) and water users in the fields of energy
production, industry, farming and their suppliers (which will develop and diffuse water
efficient practices).

Water governance is also key, as water policies intersect with a wide array of sectors at
different  geographical  scales,  from  local  to  transboundary  levels.  Analysis  of  water
governance arrangements in OECD countries has highlighted that a lack of finance for

212

OECD ENVIRONMENTAL OUTLOOK TO 2050 © OECD 2012

5. WATER

water resource management is a  primary concern  for most countries, followed by the
fragmentation of roles and responsibilities at central and sub-national levels, and the lack
of capacity (infrastructure and knowledge) at the territorial level (OECD, 2011g). In the case of
transboundary rivers, lakes or aquifers, governance is essential to prevent diplomatic and
social tensions. Generic instruments, such as the UNECE Convention on the Protection and
Use  of  Transboundary  Watercourses  and  International  Lakes  (Water  Convention)  and
specific ones (such as the International Fund for Saving the Aral Sea, IFAS) have a role to play.

2. Key trends and projections

This section reviews trends and long-term projections for water demand, exploitation and
availability (including groundwater and water stress), water-related disasters, water quality
and access to water supply and sanitation services. It also provides definitions of the terms
used (Box 5.1). More detail on the assumptions made and analysis underpinning this section
can be found in Chapter 1 (Introduction) and in Annex 5.A at the end of this chapter.

Box 5.1. Key definitions

The chapter refers to several concepts which need to be carefully defined.
Water demand: the demand for water by different water users. Water demand can be
met from freshwater withdrawn from the environment (a river, lake or aquifer) or from
other sources of water (e.g. recycled water).

Water abstraction (or withdrawal) is water physically withdrawn from the environment.
Part  of  that  water  may  return  to  the  environment.  Typically,  a  number  of  industries
abstract  water  for  cooling  purposes –  then  return  the  water  to  the  environment  in  a
suitable condition  for use by other  purposes.  However,  a  significant part of the  water
abstracted from the environment is lost. For instance, in some cities, up to 40% of the water
treated for domestic uses leaks from pipes.

Water consumption: water use that reduces either the quantity or quality of water that
is returned to the environment. Consumed water is not necessarily abstracted from the
environment (it can be generated from other sources, e.g. recycled water). A variety of
water uses do not consume water (e.g. shipping, swimming, the environment). These uses
should  however  be  taken  into  account  in  water  resource  management  (e.g. through
environmental flow and quality requirements for environmental purposes). In the case of
agriculture,  water  consumption  occurs  through  evapotranspiration  and  harvesting  of
crops. In the case of hydropower, water consumption includes the additional evaporation
that results from the increased surface of the water body impounded by the dam. The
impacts of  domestic  and  industry  uses  on  water  quality depend  on  treatment  before
discharge into the environment.

Groundwater depletion: when groundwater is abstracted at a greater rate than natural

recharge.

Blue water: freshwater in aquifers, rivers, lakes, that can be withdrawn to serve people,
for  example  as  water  for  irrigation,  manufacturing,  human  consumption,  livestock,
generation of electricity.

Green water: precipitation that naturally infiltrates into the soil and leaves the drainage

basin through evapotranspiration into the atmosphere.

OECD ENVIRONMENTAL OUTLOOK TO 2050 © OECD 2012

213

5. WATER

Box 5.1. Key definitions (cont.)

Water  stress: a measure of the total, annual average water demand of “blue water”
(see above) in a river basin (or sub-basin) compared with the annual average water available
(precipitation minus evapotranspiration) in that basin. The green water flow is thus taken into
account in the volume of available water. Often the resulting ratios are grouped into four
categories: less than 10% = no stress; 10-20% = low stress; 20-40% = medium stress; and more
than  40% = severe  stress.  Given  seasonal  and  inter-annual  variability  of  demand  and
supply, and the wish to maintain an environmental flow level, high ratios imply a high risk
that water supply will be inadequate.

Freshwater demand and exploitation
Recent trends in OECD countries

Globally, it is estimated that water demand rose twice as fast as population growth in
the last century. Agriculture was the largest user of water, accounting for about 70% of total
global freshwater demand (OECD, 2008c). The largest global water demand after irrigated
agriculture in 2000 was for electricity generation, primarily for cooling of thermal (steam
cycle-based) power generation.

In the OECD area, total surface water abstraction has not changed since the 1980s
(Figure 5.1). This is despite increases in abstractions for public water supply and, to a lesser
extent, irrigation. This stability can be explained by more efficient irrigation techniques;
the decline of water intensive industries (e.g. mining, steel); more efficient use of water for

thermoelectric power generation; the increased use of cleaner production technologies;
and reduced leaks from piped networks. More recently, this stabilisation also partly reflects
droughts, i.e. that water was physically not available for abstraction in some regions.

OECD agricultural water use rose by 2% between 1990 and 2003, but has declined since
then. Irrigation accounted for 43% of total OECD water use in 2006. Much of the growth in
OECD agricultural water use occurred in Australia, Greece, Portugal and Turkey – countries
where farming is a major water user (more than 60% of total freshwater abstractions) and/
or irrigation plays a key role in the agricultural sector (on more than 20% of cultivated land).

Although at the national level, most OECD-country water use is sustainable overall,
most still face at least seasonal or local water shortages and several have extensive arid or
semi-arid regions where lack of water constrains sustainable development and agriculture.

Figures 5.2 and 5.3 display the intensity of use of freshwater resources (both surface
and  groundwater)  expressed  as  gross  abstractions  per  capita  and  as  a  percentage  of
renewable  resources.  Indicators  of  water-use  intensity  show  large  variations  among
individual OECD countries. European countries tend to be less water intensive in per-capita
terms.  Water  use  is  more  sustainable  in  some  countries  than  in  others.  For  example,
Canadians withdrew roughly 1.2% of the country’s total average water yield in 2005, while
Korea abstracted more than 40%, putting its water balance at risk. The situation is also a
concern in some OECD European countries such as Belgium and Spain, where abstraction
as a share of renewable water resources is higher than 20% (Figure 5.3).

However,  the  situation  is  more  complex  than  is  implied  by  aggregate  indicators.
National indicators may conceal unsustainable use in some regions and periods, and high
dependence on water from neighbouring countries (in the case of transboundary basins).
In arid regions, freshwater resources may at times be so limited that demand, so far, is only
met by exploiting it unsustainably.

In OECD countries, principal concerns are the inefficient use of water (including waste,
for instance through leaks from urban supply systems) and its environmental and socio-
economic consequences: low river flows, water shortages, salinisation of freshwater bodies
in coastal areas, human health problems, loss of wetlands and biodiversity, desertification
and reduced food production.

Global water demand by 2050

The Environmental Outlook Baseline scenario projects future global water demand to
increase significantly – from about 3 500 km3 in 2000 to nearly 5 500 m3 in 2050 (Figure 5.4),
or a 55% increase. This increase is primarily due to growing demand from manufacturing
(+400%, about 1 000 km3),  electricity (+140%, about 600 km3) and domestic use  (+130%,
about 300 km3). However, demand does not automatically translate into consumption, as a
significant  share  of  water  is  discharged  back  into  water  bodies  after  use,  remaining
available for use downstream, depending on water quality.

Without new policies, the relative importance of uses which drive water demand is
also projected to shift significantly by 2050. Sharp rises in water demand are expected in
South Asia and China as well as other emerging economies of the BRIICS (Brazil, Russia,
India, Indonesia, China and South Africa), with much higher shares for manufacturing,
electricity and domestic supply in 2050. Developing countries (rest of the world or the RoW)
are also projected to see significant water demand for electricity generation. In all parts of
the world, the growing demand for these uses will compete with demand for irrigation
water. As a result, the share of water available for irrigation is expected to decline (Box 5.2).
If the model projections were to factor in the additional water needed to ensure enough
flows to maintain ecosystem health, the competition among different water users would
intensify even further.

Box 5.2. Uncertainties about agricultural water demand

The projections for irrigation water use in this Environmental Outlook assume that the

area of irrigated land will stay constant to 2050 for several reasons:

■ Most analysts observe that massive extension of irrigation will not be possible in the
coming decades because available land for irrigation is scarce in most regions; where it
is available, the land is unlikely to be irrigated soon because of lack of infrastructure and
limited public budgets.

Irrigation  is  expected  to  compete  increasingly  with  other  water uses,  and  experience
indicates that domestic uses usually receive priority over irrigation in water allocation.

■ There  is  significant  uncertainty  about  the  current  extent  and  future  extension  of
irrigated land and irrigation water use. A review of scenario projections in the literature
with similar assumptions to the OECD’s Outlook Baseline indicates that projections range
from  the  current  uncertain  level  to  plus  10%-20%  until  the  middle  of  the  century
(see Annex 5.A).

Given the uncertainty regarding this issue and the limited potential for expansion, this
Outlook takes a conservative approach and assumes no expansion of irrigated land. This
may underestimate future water stress in some regions. Further discussion of the methods
used to estimate water demands for the Environmental Outlook is provided in Annex 5.A.

Water stress: A growing problem

Increased water demand will exacerbate water stress (see Box 5.1 for definition) in
many  river  basins,  in  particular  in  densely  populated  areas  in  rapidly  developing
economies. More river basins  are projected to come under severe water stress by 2050
under the Baseline scenario, mainly as a result of growing water demands (Figure 5.5). The
number of people living in these stressed river basins is expected to increase sharply, from
1.6 billion in 2000 to 3.9 billion by 2050, or more than 40% of the world’s population. By
then, around three-quarters of all people facing severe water stress will live in the BRIICS.
Almost the entire population of South Asia and the Middle East, and large shares of China
and North Africa’s population, will be located in river basins under severe water stress. The
consequences for daily life are uncertain, depending greatly on the adequacy of water
management strategies put in place. On the other hand, water stress is projected to be

somewhat reduced in some OECD countries,  e.g. the United States. This results from a
projected decrease in demand (driven by efficiency gains, and a structural shift towards
service sectors that are less water intensive) and higher precipitation caused by climate
change (Box 5.3).

5. WATER

Box 5.3. The impact of climate change on freshwater: An example from Chile
Climate change will affect freshwater resources through shifts in the hydrological cycle.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projects that the impact of climate
change  on  freshwater  systems  and  their  management  will  be  felt  primarily  through
temperature increases, sea-level rise and precipitation variability. There will be shifts in
the quantity, variability, timing, form, and intensity of precipitation and annual average
run-off; the frequency and intensity of extreme events such as floods and droughts will
increase; water temperature and the rate of evapotranspiration will increase; and water
quality will deteriorate (Bates et al., 2008). The nature and magnitude of these projected
impacts are highly context specific, with some regions projected to have too much or too
little water and many regions suffering unsustainable levels of water pollution driven by
higher variability in precipitation and river discharge. These problems will become more
severe in the second half of the century (IPCC, 2008).

To date,  economic growth and  population dynamics have  affected water more  than
climate. A more immediate consequence of climate change is a call for resilience and
flexibility  in  water  allocation  mechanisms  and  water  infrastructures  (including
hydropower,  structural  flood  defences,  drainage  and  irrigation  systems,  wastewater
treatment), as future water regimes are less certain.

For example, in recent years, various national studies conducted in Chile have allowed
for the preliminary quantification of the impacts of climate change on water resources. In
particular,  studies  have  analysed  the  impact  of  the  changes  in  temperature,
evapotranspiration and precipitation on hydrologic resources in eight river basins located
along the central valley of Chile.

The  analysis  projects  water  flow  to  decrease  on  average  in  all  river  basins  by  35%
between 2041 and 2070. The most northern and southern regions analysed (the Limarí and
Cautín basins) will be more severely affected in the short term. The results also show
variations in the timing of increased flow levels produced by melting snow in some river
basins, which  in  some  cases  would shift  from  spring and  summer to  winter months.
Practically all of the river basins analysed show a major increase in the number of months
with hydrological deficits. This will greatly affect the availability of water resources for
different productive sectors in Chile. At the same time, the predicted rise in temperatures
is expected to produce an upward shift in the altitude of the snow line and lead to an
increase in hydrologic flows generated during the winter in the Andes Mountains.

Groundwater depletion

Groundwater is by far the largest freshwater resource on Earth (not counting water
stored as ice). It represents over 90% of the world’s readily available freshwater resource
(UNEP, 2008; Boswinkel, 2000). The total amount is difficult to assess, but one estimate

OECD ENVIRONMENTAL OUTLOOK TO 2050 © OECD 2012

219

5. WATER

suggests  that,  worldwide,  groundwater  resources  amount  to  some  10.5 million km3
(Shiklomanov and Rodda, 2003). Especially in areas with limited surface water supply, such
as parts of Africa, and where there is no other alternative, it is a relatively clean, reliable
and  cost-effective  resource.  Groundwater  also  plays  a  significant  role  in  maintaining
surface water systems through flows into lakes and rivers.

However, the rate of groundwater exploitation is becoming unsustainable in a number
of regions. The role of groundwater as a water source is becoming increasingly prominent
as modern extraction technologies become commonplace and more accessible surface
water  resources  are  gradually  over-exploited.  The  fraction  of  global  freshwater  use
currently drawn from groundwater is estimated globally at 50% of domestic water supply,
40% of water withdrawals for self-supplied industry and 20% of irrigation water supply
(Zektser and Everett, 2004). In the European Union, the fraction of groundwater supply for
domestic water  use is approximately 70%; in  France, groundwater accounts for 63% of
withdrawals for domestic uses, 41% for industry, and 20% for irrigation.

In the last half  of  the  20th century, the boom in  agricultural  groundwater use  has
improved  livelihoods  and  food  security  for  billions  of  farmers  and  consumers.  But
groundwater depletion may be the single largest threat to irrigated agriculture, exceeding
even the build-up of salts in soils. Rapid groundwater depletion is a consequence of the
explosive spread of small pump irrigation throughout the developing world. The volume of
groundwater used by irrigators is substantially above recharge rates in some regions of
Australia, Greece, Italy, Mexico and the United States, undermining the economic viability
of farming. In countries with significant semi-arid areas such as Australia, India, Mexico
and the United States, more than one-third of irrigation water is pumped from the ground
(Zektser  and  Everett, 2004).  Over-exploited  aquifers,  especially  in  semi-arid  and  arid
regions, lead to environmental problems (poor water quality, reduced stream flows, drying
up of wetlands), higher pumping costs and the loss of a resource for future generations
(Shah et al., 2007).

Although we use only a relatively small fraction of the Earth’s known groundwater
reserves,  the  rate  at  which  global  groundwater  stocks  are  shrinking  (“groundwater
depletion” – see Box 5.1) has more than doubled between 1960 and 2000, from 130 (± 30) to
280 (± 40) km3 of water per year (Wada et al., 2010). During the past 50 years, groundwater
depletion  has  spread  from  isolated  pockets  to  large  areas  in  many  countries.  One
assessment shows that the highest rates of depletion are in some of the world’s major
agricultural  centres,  including  northwest  India,  northeast  China,  northeast  Pakistan,
California’s central valley, and the Midwest of the United States (Wada et al., 2010). It found,
furthermore, that the rate of depletion increased almost linearly from the 1960s to the
early 1990s, linked to rapid economic growth and population increase, mainly in India and
China.

The depletion of even a small portion of the total volume of groundwater (in some
cases only a few percent) has a substantial effect on water resources. For example, it can
cause land subsidence, which permanently reduces aquifer storage capacity and increases
susceptibility to flood damage. And where groundwater discharges to streams and lakes,
even a small amount of groundwater depletion reduces stream flow and lowers lake water
levels, reducing the amount of surface water available for use by humans or riparian and
aquatic  ecosystems. These external effects can  in turn  become limiting  factors to the
further development of the groundwater resource (Alley, 2007).

5. WATER

Although  it  is  essential  to  balance  exploitation  of  groundwater  resources  with
supplementation, many dry countries subsidise groundwater exploitation either directly or
indirectly (for instance, some policies relieve farmers of the need to pay the price of energy
for pumping water from  aquifers), and do not have policies to replenish the  exploited
groundwater.  Energy  subsidies  to  agriculture  have  significantly  lowered  the  costs  of
extracting groundwater in a number of OECD countries and India.

Water-related disasters

Many people already have to use water that is inadequate in both quantity and quality.
The stress from droughts and floods threatens their security even further. Flood, storm and
drought  disasters  have  implications  for  health,  the  environment  and  economic
development. For example, in 1983, drought in Ethiopia and Sudan led to over 400 000 deaths
through famine. Drought in India, and floods and storms in China affected 450 million
people in 2002. In the United States in 2005, Hurricane Katrina and the flooding it caused
led to damage valued at USD 140 billion.

Recent trends

The number of weather-related disasters has increased worldwide over the last three
decades,  particularly  floods,  droughts  and  storms  (Figure 5.6).  Trends  in  water  and
weather-related disasters between 1980 and 2009 have been analysed using information
from the Emergency Events database (EM-DAT), maintained by the Centre for Research on
the Epidemiology of Disasters (CRED).3 The database compiles information on the human
and economic impacts of water-related disasters and indicators monitor direct economic
losses and  the number of  victims (people  affected or killed). Disasters  are categorised
according to their causes (floods, droughts and storms).

Figures 5.6 shows historic trends in the number of weather-related “severe” disasters
(Panel A), in terms of number of victims (Panel B) and economic losses (Panel C). The main
drivers of this increase are a growing world population, increasing wealth and expansion
of built-up areas. Although there is a tight relation between extremes in climate variables
and weather-related  disasters  (IPCC, 2011),  there  is  not enough data  to confirm  a  link
between frequencies of disasters and climate change. Studies where economic losses have
been corrected for population growth and economic growth generally show stabilised or
even decreasing trends in losses due to severe water events (Neumayer and Barthel, 2011;
Bouwer, 2011; and see Annex 5.A).

Floods made up well over 40% of all weather-related disasters between 1980 and 2009,
storms  nearly  45%  and  droughts  15%.  The  number  of  victims  ranges  between  about
100 million and 200 million per year, with peaks of 300 million or more. Almost two-thirds
of  the  victims  can  be  attributed  to  floods.  Droughts  and  other  temperature  extremes
account for 25% and storms the remaining 10%.

Economic  losses  are  estimated  to  range  between  USD 50-100 billion  per  year
between 1980  and 2009.  A  peak  of  USD 220 billion  reflects  the  Katrina  disaster  in  the
United States in 2005. Storms account for half of all losses, floods one-third and droughts
almost 15%.

The number of disasters has been spread quite equally over the regions: almost 40% in
the  OECD, 30%  in  the BRIICS  and  30% in the  RoW.  But there  is  a striking difference in
impacts between these three groups of countries. Well over 80% of victims (people affected

or killed) were in the BRIICS countries, nearly 15% in the RoW and only about 5% in OECD
countries. OECD countries suffered almost two-thirds of the economic losses, BRIICS one
quarter and RoW over 10%. These figures reflect differences in adaptive capacity and the
economic value of real estate and other property in the three groups of countries.

Floods: The picture to 2050

The Environmental Outlook Baseline projects the world’s population to increase by one-
third to over 9 billion in 2050 (Chapter 2). In flood plains and deltas – those areas most
affected by floods – the population is projected to increase even more rapidly, by nearly 40%
over the same period. Changes in exposure of people and economic assets, and in some
cases changes in vulnerability, have been the major drivers of the observed increase in
disaster losses in the past (IPCC, 2011). This trend may continue in the coming decades.
Leaving aside climate change as a likely key driver of floods by 2050, the number of people
and value of assets at risk will still be significantly higher than today: more than 1.6 billion
people  (or  nearly  20%  of  the  world’s  population)  and  economic  assets  worth  some
USD 45 trillion (340% more than in 2010). By region, the increase in economic value at risk
is almost 130% for the OECD, over 640% for the BRIICS and nearly 440% for developing
countries (see Annex 5.A for more detail on these calculations).

Vulnerability to floods is not evenly distributed within countries and often the poorest
suffer  disproportionally.  For  example,  Dhaka,  Kolkata,  Shanghai,  Mumbai,  Jakarta,
Bangkok, and Ho Chi Minh City represent the cities with most people at risk to flooding and
all are also situated in countries with low national GDPs per capita in both 2010 and 2050
(see Annex 5.A).  This  list  of  cities  agrees  with  an  earlier  OECD  study  on  coastal  cities
referred to in Chapter 3 on climate change (Nicholls et al., 2008).

Water quality

Good  quality  water  is essential  for  human  well-being, to  support  healthy  aquatic
ecosystems  and  for  use  in  primary  industries  such  as  agriculture  and  aquaculture.
Eutrophication (discussed below), acidification, toxic contamination and micro-pollutants
all place pressures on human health, the cost of treating drinking water, irrigation and the
maintenance of aquatic ecosystems. Water quality that is too poor for use exacerbates the
problem of water scarcity.

Recent trends in OECD countries

Despite significant progress in OECD countries in reducing pollution loads from municipal
and industrial point sources by installing wastewater treatment plants and reducing chemical
use, improvements in freshwater quality are not always easy to discern,4 except for organic
pollution. Pollution loads  from  diffuse  agricultural  and  urban sources  (fertilisers  and
pesticides, run-off from sealed surfaces and roads, and pharmaceuticals in animal and human
waste) are continuing challenges in many countries.

The share of nutrient water pollution from farming has risen as absolute levels of
industrial and urban pollution have decreased more rapidly than those from agriculture.
The pressure from agriculture on water quality in rivers, lakes, groundwater and coastal
waters in most OECD countries eased between 1990 and the mid-2000s due to a decline in
nutrient surpluses and pesticide use. Despite this improvement, absolute levels of nutrient
and pesticide pollution remain significant in many OECD countries and regions. In nearly
half of OECD countries, nutrient and pesticide concentrations in surface and groundwater

223

5. WATER

in agricultural areas exceed national recommended limits for drinking water standards.
Another concern is agricultural pollution of deep aquifers, where natural recovery from
pollution can take several decades. In some cases, a reduction of agricultural pollution has
not  helped  to  improve  water  quality  due  to  legacy  pollution  from  slow-moving  older
groundwater.

The economic costs of treating  water  to remove nutrients  and  pesticides  to  meet
drinking water standards are significant in some OECD countries. Eutrophication of marine
waters  also  imposes  high  economic  costs on commercial  fisheries  for some countries
(e.g. Korea and the United States). Persistent micro-pollutants in water bodies also add to
the costs of treating water for potable use (Box 5.4).

Box 5.4. Addressing the risks from micro-pollutants

A growing source of concern is micro-pollutants and their effects on aquatic ecosystems
and human health. Micro-pollutants include medicines, cosmetics, cleaning agents, or
biocide residues (herbicides, fungicides). They enter water bodies from urban drainage,
agriculture, rainwater runoff from transport routes and sealed surfaces. They can have
negative effects on organisms, including humans, typically by interfering with endocrine
(hormone) systems leading to cancers, birth defects, and other developmental disorders
(see Chapter 6, Section 4 on chemicals). The risks are compounded by the combination of
multiple pollutants in water bodies, which  can together create additional pressures on
organisms.  Moreover,  micro-pollutants  tend to  be  persistent:  they  are not  adequately
removed by regular treatment  technologies. This  allows them to accumulate in water
bodies and sediments, leading to higher concentrations. The expected increase in the
frequency and intensity of extreme weather events and high flow rates caused by climate
change may cause re-suspension of pollutants stored in sediments.

Addressing this issue requires complementary approaches: reducing contamination at
source; retrofitting of existing wastewater  treatment plants with additional treatment
facilities  such  as  ozonation,  and  powdered  active  carbon;*  setting  up  decentralised
treatment  plants  for  places  where  large  volumes  of  micro-pollutants  are  likely  to  be
generated  (e.g. hospitals,  nursing  homes);  and  developing  and  disseminating  new
treatment technologies such as sensors, nanotechnologies, and hybrid treatments.

* The Swiss authorities plan to retrofit 100 out of 700 operating wastewater treatment plants.

Eutrophication of surface water and coastal zones

Eutrophication occurs when water bodies receive excess nutrients that stimulate too
much plant growth, leading to oxygen depletion and harmful algal blooms. It is a serious
concern, causing aquatic biodiversity loss in rivers, lakes and wetlands, hampering human
use of the water (e.g. drinking water, recreation, fishing, swimming) and it can also affect
human  health  (see below  and  Chapter 4 on  biodiversity).  Eutrophicating  pollution
originates from point sources (urban wastewater systems) and diffuse sources (mainly run-
off from agricultural land). Each issue is discussed below.

Under the Baseline scenario, eutrophication is expected to increase globally in the coming
two decades, then stabilise in some regions (the OECD, Russia and Ukraine). In Japan and Korea
nutrient surpluses per hectare of agricultural land have already reached high levels. In China,
India, Indonesia and developing countries, eutrophication is projected to increase after 2030; in

224

OECD ENVIRONMENTAL OUTLOOK TO 2050 © OECD 2012

5. WATER

China, this is driven by nutrients from wastewater – surpluses in agriculture are projected to
stabilise. In Brazil, eutrophication is expected to increase, driven by growing phosphorus
surpluses from agriculture, while phosphorus from wastewater effluents and nitrogen is
projected to stabilise or decrease after 2030.

Nutrient effluents from wastewater

In the Baseline, nutrient effluents from wastewater are projected to increase rapidly.
Nitrogen (N) effluents are projected to grow by 180% (from about 6 to 17 million tonnes per year
between 2000 and 2050 globally); and phosphorus (P) effluents by over 150% (from 1.3 to
3.3 million tonnes per year in the same period) (Figure 5.7). This is primarily due to population
growth, rapid urbanisation, an increasing number of households with improved sanitation and
connections to sewage systems, and lagging nutrient removal in wastewater treatment
systems. The nutrient removal in wastewater treatment systems is also expected to improve
rapidly, but not fast enough to counterbalance the large projected increase in nutrient inflows.

Nutrient effluents from agriculture

Nutrient surpluses in agriculture occur if more nutrients are added to the soil than are
withdrawn. If there is a surplus of nitrogen, it is likely to be leached into the groundwater, run
off the fields into watercourses, or be lost to the atmosphere through conversion to ammonia
(volatilisation). Nitrogen enters the soil through biological fixation, atmospheric deposition,
application of synthetic nitrogen fertiliser and animal manure. Nitrogen is withdrawn from the
soil through crop harvesting and livestock grazing. Phosphorus comes from animal manure
and fertiliser. It follows the same routes as nitrogen, except that it accumulates in the soil and
is not leached to the groundwater or lost to the atmosphere (see Annex 5.A for more detail).

Surpluses of nitrogen in agriculture are projected to decrease in the Baseline in most OECD
countries by 2050 (Figure 5.8, Pannel A). This is because the efficiency of fertiliser use is likely
to improve more rapidly than increases in productivity. In China, India and most developing
countries, the trend goes in the opposite direction: nitrogen surplus per hectare is likely to
increase as production grows more rapidly than efficiency. In China and India, crop production
is expected to grow by more than 50% between 2000 and 2030 and 10% to 20% between 2030
and 2050. In Brazil, crop production is expected to grow by 65% between 2000 and 2030 and
another 10% by 2050. The production of soybeans and other pulses in Brazil is projected to
grow by over 75% between 2000 and 2030, stabilising by 2050. The efficiency of nitrogen
fertiliser use in Brazil is projected to be high and nearly stable by 2030, because soybeans fix
atmospheric nitrogen and require little nitrogen fertiliser input.5

The growth in fertiliser surpluses in Africa (excepting Southern Africa) is dominated
by North Africa, which is projected to contribute 20% of Africa’s total nitrogen surplus and
40% of its phosphorus surplus by 2050. Surpluses in Sub-Saharan Africa are smaller than in
many other developing countries. As soils are often deficient in phosphorus, increased
fertilisers are needed to restore and improve soil fertility and sustain crop production.
Overall, total crop production in Africa is projected to increase in the  Baseline scenario
between 2000 and 2050 (North Africa by 150%; West Africa, 375%; East Africa, 265%). This is
assumed  to  be  achieved  through  a  considerable  expansion  in  agricultural  land  and
increased  yields.  If  this  production  increase  is  to  be  sustained  without  expanding
agricultural land any further, restoration and improvement of soil fertility, technological
improvements and higher fertiliser application rates – especially phosphorus – are likely to
be needed. More ecological farming techniques will be needed as well.

5. WATER

In most OECD countries, phosphorus surpluses per hectare are projected to increase
slightly in the coming two decades, but to decrease thereafter (Figure 5.8, Pannel B). In China
and India, phosphorus surpluses are also expected to decrease or stabilise, while in most
developing countries and Brazil, they are projected to increase. Phosphorus is fixed in the soil
and builds up until the soil is saturated. It is necessary to add a surplus of phosphorus to
compensate for this fixation and leave enough phosphorus for the crop. These surpluses cause
extra run-off. If the soil is saturated, fixation stops, and fertiliser inputs can approximately
equal crop withdrawal to produce crops. In that situation surpluses may tend to be zero. This
is the case in many agricultural regions in Europe, for example. China and India’s soils are
rapidly becoming saturated –hence surpluses are projected to stabilise or slightly decrease.

Brazil currently has a much lower fertiliser use per unit of production than most OECD
countries  –  this  is  projected  to  change  slowly  until  it  reaches  similar  levels  to  OECD
countries, allowing for a large increase in crop production. Another important factor is that
soybeans and other pulses require large amounts of phosphorus. These two factors explain
the increase in phosphorus surpluses in Brazil.

Environmental consequences

The deterioration in water quality is estimated to have already reduced biodiversity in
rivers, lakes and wetlands by about one-third globally, with the largest losses in China,
Europe,  Japan,  South  Asia  and  Southern  Africa  (model  calculations,  see Chapter 4  on
biodiversity). In the Baseline scenario, a further decrease in aquatic biodiversity is expected
in  the  BRIICS  and  developing  countries  up  until 2030,  followed  by  stabilisation  (see
Chapter 4 on biodiversity for further discussion). However, this modelled decrease is an
underestimation because the effects of future river dams, wetland reclamation and climate
change have not been included. Over-exploitation of some water resources and changes in
the hydromorphology of water systems have also damaged aquatic ecosystems. Setting and
enforcing minimum ecological water flow rates in rivers and restoration of morphology of
river channels and banks and flow regimes to a more natural state are increasingly a part
of environmental planning in some OECD countries, stimulated in the European Union by
the European Water Framework Directive (Box 5.9).

As a result of the increasing nutrient loads in surface water, the number of lakes with
harmful  algal  blooms is  projected  to increase  globally under the  Baseline  by some  20%
in 2050 compared to 2000, mostly in Asia, Africa and Brazil. It is expected that these effects
will be aggravated by climate change and increased water temperatures (Mooij et al., 2005;
Jeppesen et al., 2009).

The occurrence, frequency, duration and extent of oxygen depletion and harmful algal
blooms  in coastal  zones  are  projected to increase under  the Baseline  to 2050,  as  rivers
discharge  rapidly  growing  amounts  of  nutrients  into  the  sea,  especially  the  Pacific
(Figure 5.9). Phosphorus discharges are projected to increase more rapidly than those of
nitrogen and silicon (Figure 5.9, Panel B), leading to deterioration in the natural balance of
coastal marine ecosystems. Another driver exacerbating this trend is the rapid growth in
the number of dams worldwide. Dams cause sediment with silicon to settle down in the
reservoir and lower the sediment loading in rivers downstream, thereby reducing the level
of silicon. This imbalance increases the risk of harmful algal blooms.

Besides  wastewater  and  agriculture,  aquaculture  is  a  growing  source  of  nutrient
discharges. As these are not included in the model calculations, the projected nutrient
discharges to rivers and the sea may be underestimated.

Access to water supply and sanitation services
Current trends

The Millennium Development Goal (MDG) Target 7C is “to halve, by 2015, the proportion of
people without sustainable access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation”. This section
measures the  number of  people without  access to  improved  water sources  and to  basic
sanitation, as reported by the Joint Monitoring Programme. However, access to an improved
water source does not guarantee access to safe water.

OECD ENVIRONMENTAL OUTLOOK TO 2050 © OECD 2012

229

5. WATER

The official monitoring of the MDG Target 7C shows that worldwide between 1990
and 2008, the number of people with access to an improved drinking water source grew by an
estimated 1.1 billion people in urban areas and 723 million people in rural areas (UN, 2011).
Most of them live in the BRIICS. Nevertheless, in 2008, 141 million city dwellers and 743 million
rural dwellers still relied on unimproved sources of drinking water (UN, 2011). The number of
city dwellers without access to an improved water source actually increased between 1990
and 2008, as urbanisation outpaced connection (Figure 5.12).

The official monitoring also indicates that in 2008, 2.6 billion people still did not have
access to basic sanitation. According to the Global Annual Assessment of Sanitation and
Drinking-Water (GLAAS; WHO, 2010),6 the greatest numbers of people without improved
drinking water supplies and basic sanitation are in South Asia, East Asia and Sub-Saharan
Africa. To date, efforts to increase connection rates have benefitted the better-off more than
the poor (UN, 2011). This poses enormous health risks, especially to the poorest, who are the
most vulnerable.

In OECD countries, the share of the population connected to a municipal wastewater
treatment plant rose from nearly 50% in the early 1980s to about 70% today (Figures 5.10
and 5.11). For the OECD as a whole, almost half of public pollution abatement and control
expenditure relates to water (sewerage and wastewater treatment). When expenditures from
the private sector are factored in, this domain represents up to 1% of GDP in some countries.

Note: This indicator shows the percentage of national population connected to public wastewater treatment plants, and
the degree of treatment (primary treatment only, secondary treatment and tertiary treatment – defined below).
“Connected” here means actually connected to a wastewater treatment plant through a public sewage network. Non-
public treatment plants, i.e. industrial wastewater plants, or individual private treatment facilities such as septic tanks are
not covered. The optimal connection rate is not necessarily 100%; it may vary among countries and depends on
geographical features and on the spatial distribution of habitats. Primary treatment refers to treatment of (urban)
wastewater by a physical and/or chemical process involving settlement of suspended solids, or other processes in which
the biological oxygen demand (BOD) of the incoming wastewater is reduced by at least 20% before discharge and the total
suspended solids of the incoming wastewater are reduced by at least 50%. Secondary treatment refers to treatment of
(urban) wastewater by a process generally involving biological treatment with a secondary settlement or other process,
resulting in a BOD removal of at least 70% and a chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal of at least 75%. Tertiary
treatment refers to treatment (additional to secondary treatment) of nitrogen and/or phosphorous and/or any other
pollutant affecting the quality or a specific use of water: microbiological pollution, colour, etc. The different possible
treatment efficiencies cannot be added and are exclusive.

The share of population connected to wastewater treatment plants and the level of
treatment vary significantly among OECD countries (Figure 5.11): secondary and tertiary
treatment has progressed in some, while others are still completing sewerage networks or
the installation of first generation treatment plants. In the future, additional treatments
will be required to eliminate micro-pollutants (Box 5.4). Additional points of concern are
the  management  of  and  pollution  in  storm  water  and  surface  water  run-off.  Some
countries have reached the economic limit in terms of sewerage connection, and use other,
non-collective  ways  of  treating  wastewater,  mainly  from  small,  isolated  settlements
(Box 5.5).

Box 5.5. The Iberoamerican Water Programme

Spain is promoting the Iberoamerican Water Programme, endorsed by the Iberoamerican
Summit of Heads of State in 2007. This programme is devoted to achieving the MDGs on
water  supply  and  sanitation  in  Latin  America  and  involves  four  activities:  capacity
building,  technical  transfer,  institutional  strengthening  and  supporting  the  Ibero-
American  Water  Director’s  Conference  (CODIA).  One  notable  development  is  the
establishment of a Research and Testing Centre for non-conventional water treatment
technologies in Uruguay, fostering technological research and transfer through dialogue
among stakeholders and countries. This sort of technology park tests new unconventional
sanitation techniques for small and isolated communities and identifies the best option
according to climatic conditions and the specific pollutants involved.

5. WATER

Future trends

Under the Baseline scenario, access to improved water supply in the BRIICS is projected
to be universal before 2050 (Figure 5.12).7 Connection rates are likely to improve because of
higher  income  levels  and  continuing  urbanisation,  which  makes  water  supply  and
sanitation (WSS) coverage easier to achieve. However, far slower progress is expected in
developing  countries  (RoW).  The  United  Nations  estimates  that  by 2015,  89%  of  the
population in developing regions are likely to have access to improved sources of drinking
water, compared with 70% in 1990 (UN, 2011). The MDG of halving by 2015 the 1990 level of
population without improved water supply is expected to be met in most regions, but not
in Sub-Saharan Africa.

However, this apparent success can be misleading. This is so for three reasons. Firstly,
progress has been rapid in rural areas – a trend which is projected to continue under the
Environmental Outlook Baseline – but the absolute number of people in rural areas without
access is still a concern (Figure 5.12). Secondly, as noted above, the number of city dwellers
without access to improved water supply worldwide has actually increased between 1990
and 2008, as service extension fails to keep pace with city growth. Thirdly, the MDG target
indicator – the “proportion of population using an improved drinking water source” – does
not necessarily reflect access to safe water, which was defined as a fundamental human
right by the UN in 2010  (see Section 3 for more  on this).  OECD work has shown ample
evidence of this, in particular in Eastern Europe, the Caucasus and Central Asia (EECCA;
see OECD, 2011d).

Under  the  Baseline,  the  number  of  people  without  access  to  basic  sanitation  is
expected to remain at 2.5 billion in 2015 and to be almost 1.4 billion in 2050, with 60% of
them living outside the OECD and the BRIICS (Figure 5.13). This means that Sub-Saharan
Africa and a number of Asian countries are unlikely to meet the MDG target for sanitation.

As can be seen in Figures 5.12 and 5.13, the vast majority of those without access to
water supply and sanitation today live in rural areas. This trend is projected to continue
to 2050, when the number of people in rural areas who lack access to sanitation is likely to
become comparable with urban areas.

These  figures  are  daunting,  and  the  serious  consequences  of  failing  to  speed  up
progress  cannot  be  overemphasised.  The  health  consequences  are  well  documented.
Worldwide every year unsafe water, inadequate sanitation and poor hygiene claim the lives
of an estimated 2.2 million children under the age of 5. Of these deaths, 1.5 million are due
to diarrhoea, the second leading contributor to the global burden of disease. The death
(mortality) impact of diarrhoeal disease in children under 15 is greater than the combined
impact  of  HIV  and  AIDS,  malaria,  and  tuberculosis  (see Chapter 6 on  health  and  the
environment).

The implications for water quality of the failure to meet the sanitation target are also
severe.  With  progress  in  wastewater  treatment  lagging  behind  that  of  wastewater
collection, new sources of nutrients and pathogens are being deposited untreated into the
environment. The environmental consequences of this situation have been discussed in
the section on water quality above.

3. Policy: Current and future scenarios 

This section first reviews the policy instruments currently available to manage water
resources and develop water and sanitation services, illustrated by examples of recent
progress in OECD countries in applying these policy approaches. It then explores three
model-based policy  simulations to discuss alternative futures for water  use efficiency,
nutrient reduction and improved access to safe water and sanitation.

An inventory of water policy instruments

OECD  countries  have  adopted  a  range  of  policy  approaches  to  address  the  water
challenges  they  face,  including  regulatory  approaches,  economic  instruments,
information-based and other policy tools (Table 5.1).

Table 5.1. Selected policy instruments for water resource management

Regulatory (command-and-control) 
approaches

Economic instruments

Information and other instruments

Norms and standards for water quality 
(e.g. drinking water quality, ambient water 
quality for recreational water bodies, industrial 
discharges).

Charges (e.g. abstraction, pollution).
User tariffs (e.g. for water services).
Payment for watershed services 
(e.g. for protection of catchment upstream).

Metering of water usage.
Eco-labelling and certification 
(e.g. for agriculture, water-saving household 
appliances).

Performance-based standards.

Restrictions or bans on activities which have 
an impact on water resources (e.g. polluting 
activities in catchment areas; ban on 
phosphorus detergents).

Abstraction and discharge permits
Water rights.

Land use regulation and zoning (e.g. buffer 
zone requirements for pesticides application).

Insurance schemes.

Reform of environmentally harmful subsidies

Regulatory approaches

To protect human health, most countries set ambient water quality standards for
different  uses,  such  as  drinking  water  supplies,  recreation  use  or  bathing.  Quality
standards are regulated for discharges from municipal sewage systems and wastewater
treatment plants, industries and power generation facilities.

For example, Australia has non-mandatory national guidance (The National Water
Quality Management Strategy) that may be taken up in state or territory legislation and
regulated at that level. The levels of phosphorus and nitrates in the EU’s freshwater have
declined in recent years (1992-2008) according to long-term data from monitoring stations
(Eionet),  primarily  due  to  improved  wastewater  treatment  and  bans  on  phosphorous
detergents.

Water rights8

Modern water rights specify the volume of water that may be abstracted by right owners
from a water body. The volume can be a fixed amount, or a proportion of available water. In
most countries,  when explicitly defined, water rights are attached to land ownership.
Countries are gaining experience with unbundling water rights from land ownership and
managing them separately. This opens opportunities for flexible reallocation of water rights.
Indeed, water rights are potentially an effective policy instrument to re-allocate water to
higher-value uses (be it valuable crops, or selected industrial uses).

Water rights come with a range of conditions, including the payment of water fees or
charges. In practice, however, right holders may consider high water prices as depriving
them of their entitlement. In a number of jurisdictions, water rights may be traded. Water
rights tend to have a limited duration. This generates trade-offs between the security of
right holders and the flexibility of water allocation.

In most cases, before water rights can be used as a policy tool, they need to be reformed to
place water under state ownership and control. This can generate opposition from right
holders and rent seekers. Appropriate processes and compensation measures need to be
considered.

Recent developments illustrate important policy issues related to water rights. Firstly,
fast-growing economies that need to secure food supplies are increasingly making land-
lease deals with poorer nations that have fertile land with water availability (WEF, 2011);
unbundling water rights from land ownership in these countries would ensure that water
benefits domestic needs, but this may generate tensions with the new owners of the land.
Secondly, there is a risk that some water rights may be purchased for speculative purposes.
To mitigate this risk, several states in Australia prohibit or cap the ownership of water
rights by people not owning or occupying land, or restrict the proportion of entitlements in
a given catchment that can be held by non-farm users. As a result, water markets are often
inaccessible to urban users (Ekins and Salmons, 2010). Thirdly, potential negative impacts
of water re-allocation on third parties should be minimised. In particular, the needs of the
environment have to be factored in, for instance through ensuring minimum ecological
reserves.

A  variant  of  tradable  water  rights  is  tradable  nutrient  rights  to  mitigate  nutrient
pollution. The case of Lake Taupo in New Zealand is an interesting example of a tradable
rights mechanism that reduces nutrient run-offs to lakes and helps restore water quality
(see Box 5.6).

Water pricing

Putting the right price on water and water-related services encourages people to waste
less, pollute less, invest more in water infrastructure and value watershed services. Pricing
water can help serve four objectives:

■ Along  with  tax  incentives  and  transfers,  tariffs  on  water-related  services  generate

finance to cover investment and operation and maintenance costs.

It helps to allocate water among competing uses.

It can manage demand and discourage depletion of water resources.

■ Appropriate tariffs ensure adequate and equitable access to affordable water and water-

related services.

Box 5.6. Tradable nutrient rights to mitigate nutrient flows: 

The case of Lake Taupo, New Zealand

Lake Taupo is the largest freshwater lake in New Zealand, and supports an important fishery.
The regional government has decided to reduce nutrient inputs to Lake Taupo in order to
maintain or improve water quality. This is to be done through a “cap-and-trade” scheme, which
involves the following steps:

1. Define the “cap” – the nutrient load that maintains lake water quality.

2. Define  the  players  in  the  market –  those  who  release  the  most  nutrients  into  the  lake’s

catchment.

3. Allocate nutrient polluting allowances to the key players.

4. Trade allowances – this involves having a market place and setting a price.

5. Monitor compliance.

This system ensures that any increases in nitrogen leaching are offset by corresponding and
equivalent reductions in nitrogen leaching within the Lake Taupo catchment. The target is to
reduce the nitrogen load by 20%. Farms contribute more than 90% of the manageable nitrogen
input to the lake, so farmers are key parties to the scheme. Another party is the Lake Taupo
Protection Trust, which administers a fund to protect lake water quality, and will be able to
purchase nitrogen discharge allowances (NDA) and/or farmland.

The initial allowances are being allocated based on documented stocking rates, meat and wool
production, fertiliser use, and other parameters, during a five-year window and using Overseer®
(a computer model that calculates and estimates the nutrient flows in a productive farming
system) to predict nitrogen exports. When this process is completed, each farmer will have a
consent which details their NDA – a fixed amount expressed as tonnes of nitrogen per year.

From year to year, farmers can alter how they farm, provided their nitrogen export (as
predicted by Overseer®) does not exceed their NDA. If a farmer wants to increase production,
they must purchase NDA from another farmer who wants to decrease production. Once a trade
has been agreed between two farmers, each of their consents is adjusted to increase or decrease
their NDA.

Efforts are being made in OECD countries to better account for the costs and externalities
of water use by households and industrial users (OECD, 2010a). This is reflected in the level of
prices (which have increased, at times substantially, over the last decade) and in the structure
of tariffs (which better reflect consumption and treatment costs).

OECD  countries  are  also  gaining  experience  with  abstraction,  pollution/effluent
charges and other economic instruments – such as tradable water rights or payment for
watershed  services –  to  achieve  more  economically  efficient,  socially  equitable  and
environmentally sustainable abstraction and allocation among competing uses:

■ Abstraction charges are often designed to provide funding for water resources management
or for watershed protection activities. However, they seldom reflect water scarcity and tend
to be relatively low. Abstraction taxes imposed on groundwater tend to be higher than on
surface water. In most cases, charges are collected and retained locally.

■ Pollution charges can be linked to different characteristics of the polluter, the effluents
or the recipient water body. In most cases, they are collected at the local level – only

rarely at the river basin level – and earmarked to finance environmental activities. In
some  countries,  revenues  collected  from  downstream  beneficiaries  are  used  to
compensate upstream residents for restrictions put on their land use. This is an important
step towards truly integrated water and land management across a river basin.

The level of prices for water supplied to farms has risen in OECD countries. Frequently,
however, farmers are only paying the operation and maintenance costs for water supplied,
with little or no recovery of capital costs of irrigation infrastructure. Water scarcity and
environmental costs are rarely reflected in water prices. This often results from claims that
higher water prices will undercut farmers’ competitiveness on global markets. However,
where countries have raised water charges for farmers, the available evidence indicates no
reduction  in  agricultural  output  (OECD, 2010c).  Pricing  policies  for  farmers  are  often
combined with other (regulatory) instruments, such as abstraction thresholds and permits.

Tariff  levels  charged  to  households  for water  supply  and  sanitation  services  vary
greatly among OECD countries (Figure 5.14), reflecting contrasted efforts to recover the
costs  of  the  services  through  prices.  The  data  show  that  in  half  of  the  countries,
wastewater services can be more expensive than drinking water supply. They also confirm
that prices have risen over the last decade (although in some cases more slowly in the most
recent years), primarily driven by wastewater charges, which were brought in line with the
costs  of  investment  needed  for  environmental  compliance  (e.g. tertiary  treatment).
Value added tax (VAT) and other taxes also explain part of the increase.

Tariff structures for water supply vary within and across OECD countries, reflecting the
degree of decentralisation of the tariff-setting process. Several OECD surveys note that fewer
countries over the years are reporting the use of flat fees and decreasing block tariff structures.
An emerging trend in some OECD countries is the combination of fixed charges alongside a

component based on the volume of water used, or the progressive increase in the weight of
fixed charges in the overall bill.

Increasingly,  wastewater  charges  are  being  introduced  to  cover  wastewater
management costs. Most countries levy separate charges for sewerage and for wastewater
treatment, although in most cases the basis for charging remains water consumption. Only
the size of the volumetric rate differs.

Lessons have been learned on the social consequences of water tariff policies. Low
water  prices  hurt  the  poor  most,  as  they  deprive  utilities  from  revenues  to  expand
coverage, forcing the poor to procure poor quality water from private vendors. Water tariffs
can  be  structured  to  account  for  the  basic  needs  of  all  segments  of  the  population.
However, social policy objectives are better attained through socially targeted measures
such as income support. Targeting and keeping the transaction costs low are essential
criteria in designing such measures.

The pricing of water supply and sanitation services to industry is a little different to
household tariff structures. For example, more countries and regions use decreasing block
water tariffs for industry, particularly for large users. The desire to keep large customers
that  provide  substantial  local  and  stable  revenues  seems  to  inhibit  the  use  of  tariff
structures that would encourage less water use. With regard to wastewater management,
there is a growing use of separate charges for wastewater collection and for wastewater
treatment, with the latter increasingly based on the pollution load of industrial effluents,
thus better reflecting actual treatment costs.

Policy mix: Towards a coherent policy framework

Effective water management requires a coherent mix of policy instruments combining
regulatory and market-based tools, often within comprehensive management plans with
specific goals and targets. The boxes below (5.7-5.9) give examples from OECD countries of
various combinations  of policy  instruments, including economic instruments  (pricing,
trading) and institutional reforms:

■ Australia’s National Water Initiative which places a strong emphasis on water planning,

pricing and trading;

Israel’s  water  policy  which  combines  improved  technologies  with  water  pricing  and
metering; and

the  EU  Water  Framework  Directive,  which  places  an  emphasis  on  River  Basin
Management Plans and cost-effectiveness.

Australia’s  National  Water  Initiative  includes  a  comprehensive  mix  of  policy
instruments addressing different aspects of water management. This initiative is being
assessed and adjusted periodically since its implementation in 2004.

In Israel, the intensity of freshwater use is extremely high by OECD standards. Israel
already consumes more water than supplied from the environment (essentially rainfall).
Water scarcity has been exacerbated in recent years by several multiyear cycles of drought
and consequent  over-pumping of water  to meet  growing  water demands.  Rainfall  has
decreased by 9% since 1993, on average, and could drop by a further 10% between 2015
and 2035, according to climate change models. Israel’s water outlook to 2050 (Figure 5.15)
anticipates  that  increasing  population  and  agricultural  growth  will  place  additional

pressures on the country’s limited water resources, in terms of both quantity and quality
(OECD, 2011c). In this context, the water policy mix in Israel has emphasised targets to
reduce freshwater use, and the diffusion of economic instruments to manage demand and
to allocate water.

5. WATER

Box 5.7. Australia’s National Water Initiative

The Intergovernmental Agreement on a National Water Initiative (NWI) was established
in Australia in 2004. It is Australia’s blueprint for water reform. The overall objective of the
NWI  is  to  achieve  a  nationwide  market,  regulatory  and  planning  based  system  for
managing  surface  and  groundwater  resources  for  rural  and  urban  use  that optimises
economic, social and environmental outcomes at the national level. The NWI agreement
includes objectives, outcomes and commitments across eight inter-related elements of
water management: water access entitlements and planning, water markets and trading,
best practice water pricing, integrated management of water for the environment, water
resource accounting, urban water reform, knowledge and capacity building, community
partnerships and adjustment.

The Australian government publishes biennial assessment reports on the implementation
of the NWI. These national assessments cover all groundwater and surface water systems
across the states and territories, rural and urban. The 2011 assessment noted that progress
has been made since the initiation of the NWI in 2004, particularly in improving planning
frameworks, water markets and trading. The major criticisms tended to be over the pace
of reform, which was considered too slow and unequal across jurisdictions.

To address these and other issues, the Australian government has passed Commonwealth
legislation:  the  Water  Act 2007,  the  Water  Amendment  Act 2008  and  relevant  water
regulations. This regulatory framework established the Murray-Darling Basin Authority
and required it to prepare a strategic plan for the integrated and sustainable management
of water resources in the basin. The  Water  Act 2007 also established a Commonwealth
Environmental Water Holder to manage the Commonwealth’s environmental water to
protect and restore the environmental assets of the Murray-Darling Basin (Australia’s most
important agriculture region, producing one third of Australia’s food supply), and outside
the basin where the Commonwealth owns water.

The Australian government is also funding the Water for the Future initiative (Box 5.13).
This is a long-term initiative to secure the water supply of all Australians (AUD 12.9 billion
investment over 10 years); it builds on the NWI and the Water Act 2007.

The  European  Water  Framework  Directive  (WFD)  was  adopted  in 2000.  It  takes  a
holistic approach to water policy for the European Union. Its overarching objective is to
restore the status of European water bodies (surface waters, transitional waters, coastal
waters  and  ground  waters)  to  good  ecological  and  chemical  condition  by 2015.  It  is  a
flexible policy framework for the EU member states to implement according to national
legislation, but sets a number of principles and ambitious targets and makes the case for
the use of economic instruments.

Box 5.8. Policy response to water stress in Israel

Israel’s national goal is to supply water to all consumers sustainably, based on approved
requirements for quality, quantity, efficiency, and economic feasibility. To this end, Israel
has set specific targets to gradually reduce its reliance on natural potable water by 2050.
The  key  policy  initiatives  aim  to  reduce  demand  by  i) requiring  by  law  that  all  water
supplies  are  metered;  ii) monitoring  water  reuse  and  the  use  of  brackish  water  in
agriculture; and iii) promoting drip irrigation and reuse of treated domestic wastewater in
agriculture. The government also aims to increase potable water supply by constructing
large-scale desalination facilities.

Efforts are also being made to use economic instruments. Significant increases in water
tariffs have taken place or are planned in all sectors, and lower prices for effluent and
brackish water encourage their use for irrigation. A quota of potable water is allocated to
the agricultural  sector each  year; farmers  who  opt to  exchange  part  of  this  quota for
alternative sources can secure the volume of wastewater they will procure at a fixed price.

The case of agricultural water

For the world to feed its growing population, world agricultural production would need to
increase by some 70% between 2005 and 2050 (FAO, 2006; Bruinsma, 2009). According to the
Environmental Outlook Baseline, this will probably have to be achieved with less water, mainly
because of pressure from growing urbanisation, industrialisation and possibly climate change.

This implies an urgent need to adopt water-efficient irrigation technologies, such as drip
emitters, and better maintenance of irrigation infrastructure. OECD work on the transfer of
environment friendly technologies has found that the most positive environmental effects
materialise when transfer mechanisms develop the absorptive capabilities of the target
economy (see OECD, 2011f); education and training are therefore essential.

5. WATER

Box 5.9. The EU Water Framework Directive: A river basin approach

The WFD considers all pressures and impacts on the aquatic environment and integrates
requirements from other pieces of EU water legislation. The directive has a number of
objectives. The key ones are general protection of aquatic ecology, specific protection of unique
and valuable habitats, protection of drinking water resources, and protection of bathing water.
All these objectives must be integrated for each river basin.

The WFD is ambitious but flexible, as it does not prescribe one single policy package. Member
states can implement it according to their own legislation, and are free to set their own targets
for the share of water bodies which will be restored by 2015.

One core principle of the WFD is that the best model for water management is by river basin –
the natural geographical and hydrological unit – instead of according to administrative or
political  boundaries.  Therefore,  member  states  are  requested  to  develop  river  basin
management plans (RBMPs). Economic instruments, including water pricing, play a prominent
role in the WFD. The aim is to lead to the recovery of the financial and environmental costs of
water services (the cost recovery principle).

The EU WFD comes with a suite of water-related directives (e.g. Directive 2007/60/EC on the
assessment and management of flood risks entered into force on 26 November 2007), and this
requires co-ordination. In the case of the Flood Directive, co-ordination is required between
flood risk management plans  and river basin management plans, and  between public
participation procedures.

The first phase of a recent assessment concluded that, although the right measures may be
in place, they are sometimes difficult to enforce and vulnerable to political pressure at national
level (Deloitte, IEEP, 2011). Moreover, many plans appeared to delay action until the final stages
of EU law implementation. Member states have made only sluggish progress with introducing
economic instruments such as water pricing, while the principle of cost recovery remains
controversial (see Deloitte and IEEP, 2011).

In parts of the OECD water use has become more efficient and there are fewer leakages –
overall the average water application rate per hectare irrigated declined by 9% between 1990
and 2003 (OECD, 2010c). Reductions have been most notable in Australia, and to a lesser extent
in Mexico, Spain and the United States. However, in other countries – including Greece,
Portugal and Turkey – water application rates are increasing (OECD, 2008b).

Steps must be taken to move towards more efficient management of water resources in
agriculture, while responding to the growing global food demand and the impacts of climate
change (OECD, 2010c):

Institutions and water rights need to be strengthened.

■ Water supplied to agriculture needs to be subject to tariffs which take into account the cost
of supply, scarcity, social values and environmental costs and benefits. The latter are usually
addressed by other policy measures, including agri-environmental payments, pollution
taxes and water allocation mechanisms (Box 5.10). Some countries are using the principle of
full cost recovery to guide their water policy frameworks (defined as using tariffs to recover
the financial and environmental costs of water services). Trading water entitlements places
a price on scarcity and can promote the highest value use of water resources. However, such
a policy may interfere  with food  security issues,  and  requires  a well-informed and
transparent debate to be successfully implemented. Trade must be factored in, as freer trade
in agricultural commodities can enhance food security and protect environmental values.

■ Agriculture’s resilience to climate change needs to be enhanced, using strategies to adapt
agricultural production systems. These are likely to be more effective if they are embedded
in longer-term strategies closely linked to agricultural policy reform and risk management
policy.

Box 5.10. Reform of agricultural support and water: 

The case of the European Union

Until 2005, EU agricultural policy (the Common Agricultural Policy or CAP) was based on
direct aid payments to farmers to promote production. These payments were accompanied by
optional agri-environmental payments to protect and improve the environment. A common
view is that this policy has traditionally promoted a large expansion in agricultural production.
At the same time it has allowed farmers to use unecological ways of increasing production,
such as the indiscriminate use of fertilisers and pesticides, with serious environmental
consequences. A total re-focusing of the payment scheme in 2004 now puts the environment
at  the  centre  of  farming  policy.  By  linking  farmers’  payments  to  a  number  of  strict
environmental standards (among others) in the so-called cross-compliance scheme, farmers
now have to face cuts in their subsidy levels if they don’t meet the strict environmental
requirements.

Across the European Union, there are numerous examples of crops with high water
requirements that were nevertheless encouraged by the CAP. For example, maize is considered
a water-demanding crop in temperate countries, but until 2003 EU maize growers were
entitled  to  a  direct  subsidy  of  EUR 54/tonne.  With  the  new  decoupling  policy,  this
inconsistency has been eliminated, and farmers’ use of water will not be driven by subsidy
differences across crops. Garrido and Varela-Ortega (2008) have reported the gradual but
steady changes of irrigated land allocation that have occurred in Spain since the CAP reform.
The major and most significant changes are that drier areas are being allocated to vineyards,
olive trees and citrus (especially in Andalusia), while higher rainfall areas have been allocated
to water-consuming crops such as maize and other reformed crops, including sugar beet,
cotton and tobacco.

When EU farm subsidies become completely decoupled from production in 2012, the
economics of irrigation will be more guided by the productivity of crops and their water
requirements, than by the agricultural support available.

“Virtual water”: A limited concept for policy making

The concepts of “virtual water” and “water footprints” have gained broad appeal for
raising awareness of water scarcity, global impacts of consumption and production on water
resources,  and  allocation  issues.  However,  these  indicators  have  limits  as  policy  or
management tools, as they do not take into account the opportunity cost of water in
production,  other  inputs  used  in  production  (e.g. labour),  or  distinguish  between  the
management of water resources and water quality. They should be used in combination with
other indicators to discuss broader policy goals, such as reducing poverty, stimulating
economic development and ensuring high employment while preserving natural resources
(Box 5.11). Moreover, they would certainly benefit from more work to refine the calculations of
water footprints.

Box 5.11. Economic analysis of the virtual water and water footprint concepts 

for water policies

Virtual water: The term “virtual water” began appearing in the water resources literature
in the mid-1990s. Professor Tony Allan of London University chose the term to describe the
water used to produce crops traded in international markets. During the 15 years since its
inception, the virtual water concept has been very helpful in gaining the attention of public
officials  and  policy  makers  responsible  for  encouraging  wise  use  of  limited  water
resources. 

However, the fundamental shortcoming of the virtual water concept as a valid policy
prescriptive tool is the lack of an underlying conceptual framework. Some researchers
have incorrectly described virtual water as analogous to, or consistent with the economic
theory of comparative advantage. The virtual water concept is applied most often when
discussing or comparing water-short and water-abundant countries. By focusing on the
water resource endowment alone, virtual  water  represents  an application  of absolute
advantage, rather than comparative advantage. For this reason, policy prescriptions that
arise from virtual water discussions will not maximise the net benefits of engaging in
international trade. Comparative advantage is the pertinent economic concept, and virtual
water considers only absolute advantage.

A number of authors have begun describing the important role of non-water factors such
as population densities, historical production trends, national food security goals, poverty
reduction  targets,  and  the  availability  of  complementary  inputs  when  determining
whether to transfer water from one region to another, or to achieve desired outcomes
alternatively by transporting or trading agricultural commodities.

Water footprints: The notion of water footprints describes the volume of water required
to support production and consumption in selected regions  or countries. It is  used to
assess  whether  a  region  or  country  is  consuming  resources  in  a  sustainable  or
unsustainable fashion from a global perspective. However, estimated water footprints are
somewhat one-dimensional, as they depict the use of only one resource. In addition, water
footprints do not describe the implications of water use. Instead they consider only the
amounts of water used in production and consumption activities. Hence, ecological water
footprint analysis is not sufficient for determining optimal policy alternatives, as it does
not account for the opportunity (scarcity) costs of water resources and the ways in which
water is combined with other inputs in production and consumption. Water footprints
enable one to compare estimated water use per person or in aggregate across countries,
but they are inadequate for evaluating the incremental costs, benefits, or environmental
impacts of water use.

Farmers, traders, and public officials must consider many economic and social issues
when determining optimal strategies. Virtual water and water footprint concepts will be
helpful in policy discussions in many settings, in combination with other environmental,
economic, and social indicators. But they will not be sufficient for determining the optimal
outcomes of those discussions and establishing economically efficient and environmentally
effective policy alternatives.

A  recent  analysis  confirms  that  “virtual  water  transfers  are  highly  unequal  but
represent a small volume  of  water relative to total  water needs” (Seekel et al., 2011). It
concluded that “virtual water transfer is not sufficient to equalise water use among nations
primarily  because  internal  agricultural  water  use,  the  main  contributor  to  inequality,

dominates  national  water  needs  and  cannot  be  completely  compensated  by  current
volumes of virtual water transfers”.

What if…? Three model-based simulations of alternative water futures

So far this chapter has described the situation for water in 2050 under a “business-as-
usual” policy context of the Baseline scenario. But could the situation be improved in the
future with more ambitious policies? This section presents the Outlook modelling work
which explores the implications of three hypothetical scenarios:

■ a Resource Efficiency scenario;

■ a Nutrient Recycling and Reduction scenario;

■ an Accelerated Access scenario for water and sanitation.

Resource Efficiency scenario

The Resource Efficiency scenario models how the water-stress picture would change if
more ambitious policies reduced water demand and enhanced water-use efficiency. This
policy simulation is based on the 450 Core scenario explored in Chapter 3, climate change.
That  scenario  assumes  lower  water  demand  for  thermal  electricity  generation  and  a
greater share of electricity produced through solar and wind generation. In addition, the
Resource Efficiency scenario assumes further efficiency improvements of 15% for irrigation
in non-OECD countries, as well as 30% improvements in domestic and manufacturing uses
globally. Further details on the assumptions used for this policy simulation are given in
Annex 5.A.

Under the Resource Efficiency scenario, the rate of increase in global water demand is
expected to slow down. Total demand in 2050 would be around 4 100 km3, 15% above the
demand in 2000, but 25% below the Baseline scenario. In the Resource Efficiency scenario,
water demand in OECD countries would be 35% lower in 2050 than in 2000 (compared to
10% lower in the Baseline scenario).

Water stress would also improve under the Resource Efficiency scenario in many river
basins  in  China,  the  United  States,  Southern  Europe  and  Eastern  Europe  and  Russia.
However, the number of people globally living under severe water stress would be reduced
only slightly compared to the Baseline, from 3.9 to 3.7 billion (Figure 5.16), suggesting that
this scenario can only tame the severity of stress in a number of regions. The number of
people  facing no  stress would increase,  but many would still face  severe water stress,
especially in North Africa and Middle East, the India region and Central Asia.

This simulation suggests that, in a number of regions, efficiency gains alone will not
be sufficient to reduce water stress. More ambitious and radical approaches are needed to
further reduce demand and mitigate competition across water users. Allocation of water
across users (including for ecosystems) will be an important challenge.

Nutrient Recycling and Reduction scenario

This second model-based policy simulation reflects the need for aggressive policies to
further reduce nutrient discharges in order to decrease eutrophication of lakes and oceans.
The Nutrient  Recycling and Reduction  scenario assesses the  impact of measures to reuse
nutrients in agriculture and reduce both domestic and agricultural discharges of nitrogen
(N)  and  phosphorus  (P).  As  supplies  in  phosphorus  rock  dwindle,9  P  recovery  from
wastewater may help to fill the gap. The assumptions used are described in Annex 5.A.

New measures that could bring about these improvements would include an increase
in fertiliser use efficiency, higher nutrient efficiencies in livestock production and using
animal  manure  instead  of  synthetic  N  and  P  fertilisers  in  countries  with  a  fertiliser-
dominated  arable system.  The  scenario  assumes  investments  in  sewage  systems  that
separately  collect  urine  from  other  wastewater  in  households  (see Table 5.A1 in
Annex 5.A) – recycling treated wastewater back into agriculture would significantly reduce
wastewater nutrient flows and fertiliser use.

Under  this  scenario,  by 2050  the  global  N  and  P  surpluses  in  agriculture  could  be
almost 20% less than in the Baseline scenario, and the effluent of nutrients in wastewater
could fall by nearly 35%. Total nutrient loads to rivers would be reduced by nearly 40% for
nitrogen and 15% for  phosphorus  compared to  Baseline.  Such reductions could help to
prevent further biodiversity loss in rivers, lakes and wetlands in the long term, and even
allow some recovery locally. As for coastal zones, the measures to reduce nutrient flows
would  be most  effective  in  the Pacific  Ocean. For the  Atlantic  and Indian Oceans,  the
opportunities to reduce nutrient losses from agriculture are limited due to the projected
rapid growth in production (Figure 5.17). Phosphorus emissions to the Indian Ocean would
even  increase  in  the  Nutrient  Recycling  and  Reduction scenario.  This  is  because  of  the
following developments in the world regions that discharge into this ocean:

■ A small fraction of the population would have a sewage connection.

■ Current fertiliser use is low, and would have to increase to achieve the higher yields that

are assumed in this scenario; consequently run-off of N and P would increase.

■ As the use of fertilisers is low, opportunities to substitute fertiliser by manure would be

limited.

■ Manure  that  in  the  Baseline  would  end  up  outside  the  agricultural  system  (fuel  or
building  material,  especially  in  India),  would  be  used  in  agriculture  in  the  Nutrient
Recycling and Reduction scenario.

However, even if N and P loadings are reduced, the risk of harmful algal blooms in
coastal zones would stay high as the imbalance between nitrogen, phosphorus and silicon
would persist. This is caused by different reduction rates between P and N and the growing
number of dams, which decrease river loads of sediment and silicon. This suggests that an
integrated approach is required, as progress on only one nutrient will have adverse effects
in the long term.

Accelerated Access to water and sanitation scenario

In June 2010, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution recognising
access to clean water and sanitation as a human right. The resolution calls on states and
international  organisations to  provide  financial  resources,  build  capacity and transfer
technology, particularly to developing countries, in scaling up efforts to provide safe, clean,
accessible and affordable drinking water and sanitation for all. In May 2011, the Special
Rapporteur on the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation noted that these
rights should be described in terms of availability, quality, acceptability, accessibility and
affordability.10

These depart significantly from the definitions encapsulated in the MDGs. The MDGs
originally refer to “safe drinking water” and “adequate sanitation”, but actually monitor
access to “an improved water source” and “improved sanitation”. This potentially leads to a
radical re-evaluation of how many people (and what kind of people) do not have “access to
safe drinking water and sanitation”. The WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for
Water Supply and Sanitation, the official UN mechanism tasked with monitoring progress
towards the MDG on drinking water and sanitation, is considering additional criteria to
better monitor some of these dimensions.

The Environmental Outlook’s Accelerated Access scenario explores the additional annual
costs and health benefits of meeting more ambitious targets than the MDGs. The targets
would occur in two steps as follows:

i)

By 2030  the  population  without  access  to  an  improved  water  source  and  to  basic
sanitation is halved again from the 2005 base year, building on the progress already
achieved under the current MDG. 

ii) Universal access to a water source and to basic sanitation is achieved by 2050.

Under this scenario, by 2030 almost 100 million additional people would have access
to an improved water source and around 470 million more people would have access to
basic sanitation facilities than under the Baseline (Figure 5.18). Almost all of these people
would be living outside OECD and BRIICS countries (i.e. in the rest of the world – RoW).
By 2050, an additional 242 million would have access to an improved water source, with the
RoW  accounting  for  most  of  this  gain.  Over  1.36 billion  additional  people  would  have
access  to  basic  sanitation  facilities  (nearly  800 million  in  the  RoW,  and  more  than
560 million in the BRIICS).

What would the  benefits  be  from  this scenario? The consequences for  health are
discussed in Chapter 6. The estimated number of avoided deaths per year would be about
76 000 by 2030 and 81 000 by 2050, essentially in the RoW group of countries. The benefits
for  the  environment  and  certain  economic  sectors,  such  as  fisheries  or  tourism,  are
substantial.  Actual  benefits  are  even  greater,  given  that  some  significant  positive
consequences (such as pride and dignity, or amenity value) are more difficult to quantify in
monetary terms.

In least developed countries in particular, the benefits are massive and far outstrip the
costs. The World Health Organization estimates that benefit-to-cost ratios can be as high
as  7 to 1 for  basic  water  and  sanitation  services  in  developing  countries  (quoted  in
OECD, 2011b). According to the GLAAS report, improved access to water and sanitation
produces economic benefits that range from USD 3 to USD 34 for every dollar invested,
increasing a country’s GDP by an estimated 2% to 7% (WHO, 2010).

The valuation of the benefits for any single country must take account of national
circumstances, such as the stage of infrastructure development and GDP per capita. In
addition,  benefit  values  are  highly  location  specific,  depending,  for  example,  on  the
prevalence  of  water-related  diseases  or the  condition  of  receiving water bodies.  Some
benefits  are  likely  to  tail  away  as  there  tends  to  be  diminishing  returns  from  further
investments in improving quality of water related services. Benefits are more likely to
materialise  if  investments  are  appropriately  sequenced,  thereby  lowering  costs  and
ensuring that collected wastewater is properly treated.

OECD  experience  indicates  that  increasing  access  to  water  supply  and  sanitation
requires  large  investments  to  retrofit  poorly  adapted  infrastructure  and  to  build  new
facilities.  The  Accelerated  Access  scenario  indicates  that  globally  an  average  of
USD 1.9 billion  would need to be invested each year  between 2010 and 2030 to achieve
the 2030 target in addition to what would be invested under the Baseline scenario; and an
additional USD 7.6 billion beyond the Baseline would be needed annually between 2031
and 2050 to achieve the 2050 target. The difference between the two figures reflects the fact
that  the  last  step  is  more  costly  than  the  previous  ones.  In  Sub-Saharan  Africa  these
additional costs would make up 0.09% of the GDP in 2030 and 0.08% in 2050.

In  addition,  significant and stable financial  flows  will be needed  to  maintain and
operate this infrastructure. This will require well-developed and realistic strategies which
tap  three  main  sources  of  finance:  revenues  from  tariffs  for  water  services,  taxes
channelled  through  public  budgets,  and  transfers  from  the  international  community
(OECD, 2010a). The private sector (the water industry and financial institutions) can also

play a key role in developing and channelling innovations and enhancing efficiency. They
can also harness private savings and facilitate investment when appropriate framework
conditions are in place (OECD, 2009; 2010e). Increasing competition to access scarce public
financial  resources  may  be  an  incentive  to  revisit  past  experience  with  private  sector
finance  in  the  water  sector,  which  has  been  disappointing  in  developing  countries
(Annez, 2006). Public funds to achieve universal access are expected to increase when the
UN Resolution on water as a human right is translated into action. In addition, all OECD
member states are committed to raising their official development assistance to reach 0.7%
of their GDP; some of this increase could help fund these much-needed developments.

4. Need for further action: Emerging issues in water policy

The previous sections have shown  that more ambitious  policies and new  ways  of
looking at the water challenge are urgently needed. This final section highlights some of
the most important emerging directions for water policy and its reform. These include:

seeing water as an essential driver of green growth;

■ allocating enough water for healthy ecosystems;

fostering greater coherence among water, energy, environment and food policies;

finding alternative sources of water (e.g. water reuse);

filling information gaps;

■ designing reforms that are realistic and politically acceptable.

Seeing water as an essential driver of green growth

The OECD is working to reconcile the demand for continued economic growth and
development with the need to ensure that natural assets continue to provide the resources
and environmental services  on which all human well-being relies. This underpins the
concept of “green growth”, which sees sustainable water use as an essential driver, since a
lack  of  water  of appropriate quality  can  significantly  hinder growth  (OECD, 2011a).  As
discussed above, water management can generate huge benefits for health, agricultural
and  industrial  production.  Water  management  can  preserve  ecosystems  and  the
watershed services they provide, thereby avoiding the enormous costs that can be imposed
by flooding, drought, or the collapse of watershed services.

Similarly, UNEP (2011) confirms that investments in infrastructure and operation of
water-related  services  can  provide  high  returns  for  both  the  economy  and  the
environment.  It  highlights  the  need  for  more  private  and  public  investment  in  green
technologies  and  infrastructure  to  boost  water  (and  energy)  efficiency  and  sees  such
investments as critical to building the green economy of the future.

Thus, water efficiency and water demand management are essential ingredients for
green  growth,  along  with  water  reuse  and  recycling.  The  Four  Rivers  Project  in  Korea
(Box 5.12) is an example of a green growth policy factoring in investment in water-related
infrastructure.

The  following  specific  policy  approaches  can  more  systematically  harness  water

management for green growth:

Invest in ecologically sensitive water storage and water distribution  systems in water
scarce regions. Reliable resources are essential for green growth. However, water storage

Box 5.12. Korea’s Four Rivers Restoration Project (4RR)

The Four Rivers Project is a good illustration of an holistic approach to water resource
management that also aims to drive green growth. Following the economic crisis, Korea
decided  to  allocate  2%  of  its  GDP  every  year  between 2009  and 2013  (totalling
USD 86 billion) to green investment to solve short-term economic problems and create
jobs. Twenty per cent of this green budget (USD 17.6 billion) is to be invested in the water
sector through the Four Rivers Restoration Project (4RR).

This project brings five ministries together in a holistic approach (Environment; Food,
Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries; Culture, Sports and Tourism; and Public Administration
and Security; Ministry of Land, Transport and Maritime Affairs). Its aims are to secure
enough  water  to  respond  to  future  water  scarcity  and  severe  drought  due  to  climate
change (target: water supply of 1.3 billion m3); to take preemptive measures against floods
due to climate change, as well as 200-year floods, by dredging sediment, strengthening old
levees,  and  building  small  multipurpose  dams  (target:  secure  920 million m3  of  flood
control capacity); to improve water quality by expanding sewage treatment facilities and
establishing green  algae  reduction  facilities (target: BOD 3 mg/L);  to restore ecological
rivers, create wetlands, and readjust farmland to rehabilitate the ecosystem (223 restoration
projects planned); to develop river banks to ensure space for leisure; and to develop the
regions around rivers. The deadline for implementation of the plan is 2012.

The government expects the 4RR to generate USD 32.8 billion in economic benefits, and
to  create  340 000 jobs.  Ultimately,  the  government  expects  the  experiences  and
technologies developed in the 4RR project to make Korea one of the leading countries in
the water management sector.

technologies and infrastructure such as large dams can disturb ecosystem balances. Soft
infrastructure (e.g. wetlands,  flood  plains,  groundwater  recharge),  small-scale dams,
rainwater harvesting, or  appropriately designed infrastructure are more ecologically
sensitive and cost-effective.

■ Put a sustainable price on water and water-related services as an effective way to signal
the scarcity of the resource and to manage demand. This will require identifying the
beneficiaries and implementing mechanisms to ensure beneficiaries contribute to cover
the costs of the benefits they enjoy.

■ Be prepared to allocate water across sectors and across water uses where it adds most
value.  This  difficult  policy  challenge –  diverting  water  to  value-adding  activities
(including environmental services, see below) may require reallocation between water
users (e.g. from farmers to cities). Some OECD countries are gaining experience with
socially fair and politically acceptable approaches for achieving this. These include water
abstraction  licences  which  reflect  scarcity;  market  mechanisms,  e.g. tradable  water
rights; and information-based instruments (smart metering). How best to allocate water
is still the subject of widespread debate. More needs to be done to properly assess and
scale up the use of some of these instruments, to secure environmental values while
meeting social and economic needs. Experience from OECD and non-OECD countries
indicates  that building  a strong constituency and aligning  incentives are two  major
requisites (see the discussion below on the political economy of water policy reforms).

250

OECD ENVIRONMENTAL OUTLOOK TO 2050 © OECD 2012

5. WATER

Invest in water supply and sanitation infrastructure, in particular in urban slums where
unsafe water and lack of sanitation generate huge health costs and lost opportunities to
the economy.

■ Catalyse investment and innovation which will underpin sustained growth and give rise

to new economic opportunities.

Allocating enough water for healthy ecosystems

The need to restore environmental flows and to allocate more water to watershed
services is already generating interesting initiatives in several countries (Box 5.13). Well-
designed regulations (on environmental flows) and market mechanisms (such as payment
for watershed services) still need to disseminate more widely. They all benefit from more
thorough assessments of the benefits of watershed services.

However,  shifting  water  allocation –  especially  for  environmental  flows,  but  also
among other users – can be challenging, as it requires difficult policy reforms that overturn
expectations about “rights” to existing uses by different stakeholders. Gaining support for
such reforms is a major challenge for policy makers. Experience from OECD and non-OECD
countries indicates that building a strong constituency and aligning incentives are two
major  requisites  (see the  discussion  below  on  the  political  economy  of  water  policy
reforms).

Fostering greater coherence among water, energy, environment and food policies

Water policies intersect with a wide array of sectors at different geographical scales,
from local to international; coherent water governance is therefore pivotal. Analysis of
water governance arrangements in OECD countries has highlighted that along with a lack
of finance for water resource management for most countries, the fragmentation of roles
and  responsibilities  at  central  and  sub-national  levels  and  the  lack  of  capacity
(infrastructure and knowledge) in local administrations are both limitations and drivers for
future water policy reforms (OECD, 2011g).

The nexus among water, energy, environment and agriculture is close, complex, and
challenging.  Policy  coherence  among  water  policies  and  other  sectoral  policies –
particularly energy and agriculture – is thus a key component of a co-ordinated approach
to water resource  management (OECD, forthcoming).  Water is  an  essential  element  in
energy production (e.g. for biofuels, hydropower, and cooling techniques for thermal and
nuclear  power  plants).  Energy  is  a  critical  input  for  transferring  water  and  tapping
alternative sources of water  (e.g. desalinisation). In an  increasing number of locations,
there is competition between food and energy commodities for limited water resources.
Under current trends, water for the environment and for food production will conflict in
several regions (see Rosegrant et al., 2002).

Tensions  may  arise  from  real  or  perceived  trade-offs,  for  instance  between  food
security (and the willingness to secure domestic production) and water productivity (and
the allocation of water to activities which add more value). Inefficiencies may result from
harmful subsidies (e.g. subsidising energy for groundwater abstraction by farmers).

Resolving  such tensions  requires  a  global  perspective. For  instance, freer  trade in
agricultural commodities and the reform of farm support policies in OECD countries can
alleviate some of the tensions between food security and water productivity (Box 5.10). The
linkages between the policy areas also have to be considered early on. For instance, when

Australia

The  Australian  Commonwealth  Government  is  funding  the  Water  for  the  Future
initiative – a long-term initiative to secure the water supply of all Australians. Under this
programme, which involves an AUD 12.9 billion investment over 10 years, the government
is acquiring tradable water entitlements with the objective of returning more water to the
environment. The water is acquired through direct buybacks of water entitlements from
irrigators as well as savings from infrastructure upgrades. These entitlements become part
of the Commonwealth environmental water holdings and are managed so that increased
flows are provided to rivers and wetlands, particularly within the Murray-Darling Basin
(see also  Box 5.7). Between  June 2009  and  July 2011, the Commonwealth  government’s
environmental  water  holdings  rose  from  65 to  1 001 gigalitres.  By  30 June 2011,  over
550 gigalitres of Commonwealth environmental water had been delivered back to rivers,
wetlands and floodplains of the Murray-Darling Basin. A strategic Basin Plan is also being
developed in consultation with stakeholders from across the Murray-Darling to ensure the
integrated and sustainable management of the basin in the longer term. A key part of the
plan will be to set limits for water consumption in order to return sufficient water to the
environment.

Switzerland

In December 2009,  the  Swiss Parliament decided that  all  rivers and lakes should  be
revitalised to restore their natural functions and to enhance the benefits they provide to
society.  At  the  same  time  the  major  negative  environmental  impacts  of  hydropower
generation (surge and flow, reduced connectivity and impaired bed load regimes) are to be
mitigated. This is considered a new step in the restoration of river quality in the country.

The following considerations were therefore added to the Water Code:

■ River  bank  space  for  waters:  the  ordinance  sets  minimal  width  requirements  and
defines which extensive agricultural practices are allowed. The code requires that space
be made available for waters and that this is integrated into a management plan in the
next five years.

■ Revitalisation:  the  ordinance  defines  the  process  which  will  be  followed  to  plan  the
revitalisation. Highest priority will be given to revitalisations with the greatest impacts.

■ Reduction  of  the  negative  impacts  of  hydropower  generation:  the  ordinance  sets  the
impacts  considered  as  significant  and  defines  equipments  for  which  remediation
actions will be required. It also defines the process for planning and implementing such
actions. Recommendations on prioritising small hydropower station projects are being
developed  to  assist  local  authorities  to  implement  cost-covering  remuneration  for
feeding-in to the electricity grid (Confédération Suisse, 2011).

countries set biofuel production targets, there is a need to factor in potential consequences
for water withdrawal in the future.11

Policy  co-ordination  requires  institutions  to  support  discussion  among  different
communities. This is  more difficult where  responsibility is fragmented among various

252

5. WATER

ministries, and where decision making needs to be co-ordinated at different territorial
levels (national, regional, state, municipal, river basin, etc.). Institutions’ capacity needs to
be strengthened through better information and data exchange, sector integration and
joint planning.

More coherent policy approaches are beginning to take shape in a growing number of
OECD countries. This is particularly evident around climate change, with many countries
starting to co-ordinate previously separate policy domains such as energy, water, flood and
drought  control,  and  agri-environment  (Box 5.14).  For  example,  the  restoration  of
agricultural  land  in  floodplains  by  planting  trees  has  helped  to  reduce  flood  impacts,
improve water quality, restore biodiversity and sequester greenhouse gases (OECD, 2010c).
While some progress has been made, there is clearly much more to be done to achieve
greater policy coherence.

Box 5.14. Combining hydropower, river restoration and private investment 

in Bavaria, Germany

Within the context of the European Water Framework Directive, in 2006 the Bavarian
Ministry  for  Environment,  Health  and  Consumer  Protection,  the  Bavarian  Ministry  of
Economic  Affairs,  Infrastructure, Transport and  Technology  and  major electric supply
companies in Bavaria agreed on a master plan on the future of hydropower in Bavaria,
which aims to combine increased use of hydropower with restoring the ecological status of
the region’s main water bodies.

The  implementation  of  the  measures  recommended  in  the  plan would  result  in an
increase  in  climate-friendly  hydropower  production  in  Bavaria,  and  in  private  sector
investments. The plan envisages an increase in the production of hydropower by almost
14% through a combination of new plants at new sites, new plants at existing weirs or
steps, modernisation and retrofitting.

Once implemented, the plan will be a good example of how economic development and

ecological performance can be mutually reinforcing in Bavaria.

Developing alternative sources of water

Tapping alternative water sources – rain and storm water, used water, and desalinated
sea  or  brackish  water –  or  encouraging  successive  uses  of  water  can  help  to  alleviate
scarcity and can be a low-cost response to the water challenge. Additional benefits can
include saving energy (depending on the technologies and on contextual features) and
cutting  investment,  operation  and  maintenance  costs.  However,  there  are  also  risks
attached to these technologies (see Box 6.6 in Chapter 6 on Environment and Health for a
discussion).

Countries are already accumulating experience with these approaches. For example
Israel is using wastewater to recharge groundwater or for irrigation. Pollutant discharges
have been reduced by 20% (total nitrogen), 40% (organic matter) and 70% (total phosphorus)
since 2000,  largely  due  to  the  construction  of  new  wastewater  treatment  plants  and
increasing reuse of effluent in agriculture. Windhoek in Namibia and Singapore are paving
the  way  in  recycling  wastewater  for  urban  water  supply.  Rainwater  harvesting  is

increasingly considered as a complement to piped water supply (e.g. it is mandatory in
Calcutta).

A wide array of technologies, equipment and systems is available for different uses:
wastewater reuse for groundwater recharge, irrigation, gardening, or non-potable domestic
uses; rainwater harvesting to increase the yields of rain fed agriculture, or to supply water
for non-potable domestic uses, etc. Markets for technologies related to water reuse are
booming, contributing to green growth.

Governments and local authorities would benefit from considering installing these
alternative water sources and their support infrastructure. Wastewater reuse for irrigation
is being adopted in different contexts. Reuse for domestic uses is gaining traction as well,
sometimes combined with small-scale, distributed systems. This combination is particularly
appropriate in new urban areas where there is no existing central infrastructure; in city
centres with decaying water infrastructure or with infrastructure facing diseconomies of
scale  or  capacity  constraints;  in  urban  renewal  projects;  in  unstable  contexts,  where
flexibility, resilience and adaptation are valuable (i.e. because of climate change impacts);
and in projects where property developers operate the buildings they invest in (to recoup
investment costs).

The technologies involved are often simple, and future research and development will
make alternative water sources (such as sea water desalination) even more competitive. To
realise the full benefits of alternative water systems and to mitigate the risks they generate
(such  as  pollution  of  agricultural  land,  or  health  risks),  the  following  steps  will  be
important:

Involve  and  inform  the  public  through  effective  communication  and  sound  evidence;
people are usually sceptical about reusing water.

■ Provide regulations that allow for alternative options for supplying water to be explored.
In particular, water quality standards need to be adjusted to specific uses and potential
reuse. Typically, urban wastewater can only be reused if it is not heavily polluted. Such
regulations need to factor in several dimensions, including life-cycle costs and benefits,
and the risks and uncertainties attached to the various water sources and technologies.

■ Ensure that water sector regulators monitor the quality of a variety of water sources.

■ Ensure  that  the  price  of  water  reflects  its  scarcity  in  order  to  stimulate  markets  for

alternative water sources.

■ Plan  the  development  of  several  water  sources  and  infrastructure  (e.g. central  and
distributed systems) thoroughly, as tapping alternative water sources can challenge the
business model of existing operators (either public or private).

Filling information gaps 

Reforms and new policies are most successful when: i) they rely on robust data and
information  (on  water  availability,  water  use,  the  costs  and  benefits  of  water-related
services); ii) they are backed by realistic and enforceable action and investment plans; and
iii) they are designed by a community of stakeholders with a clear understanding of their
own needs and priorities.

There is a crucial need to develop water information systems (WIS) to support more
efficient and effective delivery of sustainable water resource management and policies
(OECD, 2010d). In particular, the rapid development in water policy reforms has created an

254

information imbalance in many countries, with implementation of water policy initiatives
often supported by little data and information.

There are also uncertainties when analysing the kinds of trends and model-based
projections presented in this chapter because of data gaps and uncertainties surrounding
future scientific developments or policy outcomes. Examples of uncertainties include the
impact of climate change (patterns of precipitation and temperature change) on water
resources at a disaggregated level; the development and diffusion of new technologies in
the water  sector  (e.g. desalinisation, leakage  control, etc.), in  agriculture (e.g. new crop
varieties,  improved agricultural  practices,  irrigation  efficiency, etc.), and  in  the  energy
sector  (e.g. cooling  towers,  waterless  biofuels,  water  efficiency  in  energy  production
operations);  the  impact  of  policy  measures  on  economic  behaviour  (e.g. water  pricing
elasticity);  and  the  responses  of  water  ecosystems  to  policy  and  management
interventions (e.g. as outlined in preparation of river basin management plans in Europe or
in the design of “payment for environmental services” schemes).

In addition to these genuine sources of uncertainty, many international and national
water  information  systems  are  maintained  without  sufficiently  addressing  the  policy
relevance of the data and information that is regularly being collected. Data concerning the
economic  and  institutional  aspects  of  water  systems  are  much  less  developed  than
physical data and are only partially covered in the regular updates of most national and
international WIS.

To address these issues, there is a need to:

■ Assess  existing  WIS  at  local,  regional,  national  and  international  levels  to  determine
how current water information and data are collected (or not collected) and used (or not
used)  by  policy  makers,  and  the  costs  and  benefits  of  collecting,  analysing  and
communicating this information.
Implement a System of Environmental and Economic Accounts for Water12 (SEEAW) that
is flexible enough to respond to varying water basin, country and international policy
needs.

Improve the understanding of hydrological systems to better guide WIS data collection
efforts, for example improving knowledge of the connections between groundwater and
surface water, and determining environmental flows in the context of climate change.

■ Encourage  innovations  in  water  data  collection,  such  as  using  new  technologies  or
voluntary initiatives to collect data; or public agencies may regulate, finance or charge
for data collection, maintenance and analysis.

■ Strengthen economic and financial information including improving the understanding

and measurement of the value of water.

Designing reforms that are realistic and politically acceptable

The OECD has gained extensive experience in water policy reforms, learning from
successful  reforms  in  member  countries,  and  accompanying  water  policy  reforms  in
countries of Eastern Europe, the Caucasus and Central Asia (EECCA). Valuable lessons have
been learned from this experience in making water reform happen.

A  general  lesson  is  that  reform is  a  process  that  takes  time,  it  is  continuous  and

planning is key. Specific recommendations include:

Build a broad constituency
■ Solutions to the water challenges cannot be expected to come from water policies alone,
as discussed above. Water authorities need to work with other constituencies, including
the agriculture and energy sectors, while taking the environment into account; they also
need to work at different levels of government (local, basin, municipal, state and federal
levels).

For  river  basins  which  cross  international  boundaries,  international  co-operation  can
help – not only to share information and best practices – but also to share costs and
benefits. For example, there has been long-standing co-operation between Canada and
the United States through the Canada-US Boundary Waters Treaty and the Canada-US
Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement. The United Nations Economic Commission for
Europe  operates  the  Convention  on  the  Protection  and  Use  of  Transboundary
Watercourses  and  International  Lakes,  providing  an  important  framework  for
international co-operation.

Explore a mix of policy options and build capacity
■ As  noted  above,  there  is  a  range  of  policy  approaches  available  to  address  water
challenges (Table 5.1). An optimal policy mix combines a variety of these approaches (for
example, Israel’s water policy combines improved technologies with water pricing and
metering; see Box 5.8).

Institutions and capabilities have to be adjusted to ensure there is the expertise to make
complex technical and non-technical choices and to undertake comprehensive options
assessments (including economic, social and environmental impact assessments).

Factor in financial sustainability from the start
■ The financial dimension should be factored in early in the process (to avoid designing a
plan that is not financially affordable); cost reduction potentials have to be systematically
considered; and financial realism needs to be brought to Water Resource Management
(WRM) plans.

■ There  are  only  three  ultimate  sources  of  finance  for  water-related  investment  and
services,  the 3Ts:  tariffs,  taxes,  transfers  from  the  international  community  (e.g. EU
funds, or official development assistance). All other sources of finance, which have a role
to play, have to be paid back.

■ Strategic financial planning can help in defining and prioritising water policies within

the practical constraints of available financial resources.13
Financial incentives from other sectors should be aligned with water policy objectives
(e.g. subsidies for energy or agriculture).

Manage the political process and improve the knowledge base
■ Hard  facts  on  the  economic  dimension  of  water  policies  can  facilitate  water  policy
reforms, demystify taboos and advance debates. This requires information on water
demand and availability, and on the economic dimension and distributional impacts of
the reform of water policies.

■ Sharing  international  experience  on  water  policy  reforms  can  substantiate  such  a

process.

Notes
1. Future  projections  are  global,  with  a  particular  emphasis  on  policy  actions  needed  in  OECD
countries and the emerging economies of Brazil, Russia, India, Indonesia, China and South Africa
(BRIICS).

2. See Alcamo et al., 2007 for a detailed assessment and review of existing literature on the processes

driving water health.

3. More details are given by Visser et al. (forthcoming). The disaster database gives information on
“weather-related” rather than “water-related” disasters. These terms largely overlap but are not
identical. The  main  difference is  the category “storms”, which comprises both  storm-induced
floods, such as due to hurricane Katrina, and the direct impact of wind. The category “floods”
comprises coastal, fluvial and flash floods, along with landslides and avalanches.

4. This is because of poor data and because quality may not have systematically improved despite
these  changes.  Over  time,  improvements  in  monitoring  of  physico-chemical  pollutants  and
biological indicators can partly help to address this.

5. The soy is grown in a system of crop rotation, e.g. with maize that uses up nitrogen that has built
up in the soil; soy grown under these conditions does not leak activated nitrogen into groundwater.

6. The Global Annual Assessment of Sanitation and Drinking-Water (GLAAS) is a UN-Water initiative
implemented by the World Health Organization (WHO). The objective of UN-Water GLAAS is to
provide policy makers at all levels with a reliable, easily accessible, comprehensive and global
analysis of the evidence to make informed decisions in sanitation and drinking water.

7. See Annex 5.A for some assumptions underlying this analysis.

8. This section is based on FAO (2007).

9. Predictions for how long the world’s rock phosphorus supply will last are very uncertain. They vary
from 50 to over 100 years, but depend on estimates of available resources (van Vuuren et al., 2010).

10. See  for  instance  the  Keynote  by  Catarina  de  Albuquerque  (www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/

DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=11017&LangID=E).

11. van  Lienden  et al., (2010)  calculate  that  by 2030,  water  use  for  first  generation  biofuels  such  as
sugar  cane,  maize  and  soy  beans  may  have  increased  more  than  tenfold  compared  to  today,
enhancing  the  competition  for  freshwater  resources  in  many  countries.  A  breakthrough  in
producing  second  generation  biofuels  that  do  not  require  expansion  of  croplands  (e.g. using
residues from agriculture or forestry) will greatly reduce these impacts on environment and water
resources. See further discussions on bioenergy in Chapters 3 and 4.

12. To support implementation of environmental-economic accounts, the System of Environmental-
Economic Accounts for Water (SEEA-Water), a SEEA sub-system, provides compilers and analysts
with agreed concepts, definitions, classifications, tables, and accounts for water and water-related
emission accounts (see http://unstats.un.org/unsd/envaccounting/seeaw/).

13. See OECD (2011e) for more information on how strategic financial planning can help in practice.

ANNEX 5.A 

Modelling Background Information on Water

This annex contains further background detail for the following modelling aspects:

■ a summary of the projected socio-economic developments behind the Baseline scenario;

freshwater demand, especially irrigation;

the Resource Efficiency scenario;

■ water quality, especially nutrient effluents;

the Nutrient Recycling and Reduction scenario;

■ people and assets at risk from water-related disasters;

■ water supply and sanitation.

More  general  information  on  the  modelling  context  for  the  Environmental  Outlook  is
provided  in  Chapter 1,  and  further  details  on  the  models  used  are  in  the  Annex  on  the
Modelling Framework at the end of the report.

Socio-economic developments under the Baseline scenario

The Environmental Outlook Baseline scenario makes projections of a number of socio-
economic developments as outlined below (and further discussed in Chapters 1 and 2), and
these  in  turn  were  used  to  construct  the  Baseline  projections  on  water-related  issues
discussed in this chapter (except water-related disasters):

■ World GDP is projected to nearly quadruple over the coming four decades, in line with
the  past  40 years  and  based  on  detailed  projections  on  the  main  drivers  of  economic
growth. By 2050, the OECD’s share of the global economy is assumed to decline from 54%
in 2010 to less than 32%, while the share of Brazil, Russia, India, Indonesia, China and
South Africa (BRIICS) is assumed to grow to more than 40%.

■ By 2050, the world is assumed to add over 2.2 billion people to the current 7 billion. All
world regions are assumed to be facing population ageing but will be at different stages
of this demographic transition.

■ By 2050, nearly 70% of the world’s population is assumed to be living in urban areas.

■ World  energy  demand  is  assumed  to  be  80%  higher  in 2050  under  current  policies.
The 2050 global energy mix is assumed to be fairly similar to today’s, with the share of
fossil  energy  still  at  about  85%  (of  commercial  energy),  renewables  including  biofuels
(but  excluding  traditional  biomass)  just  above  10%,  with  the  balance  being  nuclear.
Among  fossil  fuels,  it  is  uncertain  whether  coal  or  gas  will  be  the  main  source  of
increased energy supply.

■ Globally, the area of agricultural land is assumed to expand in the next decade, but at a
slower  rate.  It  is  assumed  to  peak  before 2030  to  match  the  increase  in  food  demand
from a growing population, and decline thereafter, as population growth slows down and
yield improvements continue. Deforestation rates are already declining, and this trend is
assumed  to  continue,  especially  after 2030  with  demand  for  more  agricultural  land
easing (Section 3, Chapter 2).

Water demand

Demands for irrigation are calculated by the process-based LPJmL model (Box 5.A1).
LPJmL stands for “Lund – Potsdam – Jena managed Land Dynamic Global Vegetation and
Water Balance Model” (Rost et al., 2008). Abstractions for domestic uses are estimated using
a relatively simple equation, which takes into account the number of people, their income
level, climate and cultural influences and whether or not they are connected to tap water
supply.  Geographical  distribution  is  modelled  from  downscaled  population  projections,
corrected  for  urban/rural  splits  and  income  dependent  connection  rates  to  tap  water
systems. Industrial water for processing and cooling purposes is based on the value added
of  the  output  produced,  corrected  by  efficiency  improvements  in  processes  and
applications. A relatively small share of water, though vital at the place of consumption, is
used for livestock (see below). Finally, a large and growing volume is assumed to be used in
electricity production for cooling purposes. Electricity produced from thermal (steam) cycle
plants is the main driver. The model takes into account the change over time in efficiency,
the cooling mode and the share of new technologies with reduced cooling water demand,
such as combined cycle installations.

Not all demands lead one-on-one to consumptive use. Varying shares are lost to the
atmosphere or embedded in products carried off to other locations. The remainder returns
to  the  same  water  basin,  with  some  delay  and  changes  in  heat  and  pollution  load.  For
water stress calculations, the total demands are compared with the renewable supply, on
an average annual basis and aggregated per major water (sub-) basin.

Estimation of historical, current and future water demand is characterised by many
uncertainties. Water is often freely available to users, and can be withdrawn from surface
waters (rivers, natural lakes, reservoirs), but also from groundwater reservoirs and wells
without  any  formal  metering  or  monitoring  taking  place.  There  is  very  little  published
monitoring  data  on  the  global  area  equipped  for  irrigation,  and  even  less  for  the  areas
actually  irrigated,  the  water  volumes  applied  to  the  fields  and  extracted  from  river
systems.  Existing  data  sources  show  substantial  differences,  even  for  OECD  countries,
which are relatively well monitored compared to other world regions.

Estimate of water demands in 2000

The global demand for irrigation water estimated with the LPJmL model is estimated
at  2 400 m3  for  the  year 2000,  though  estimating  this  is  fraught  with  uncertainty
(see section below). On the global scale as much as 50% of the water extracted is estimated
to be lost for effective supply to crops, and does not contribute to soil moisture for plant
growth. Other estimates in the literature end up around the same level: e.g. 51% (Fischer
et al., 2007) to 60% (Fraiture et al., 2007).

Based on an estimate made for the previous OECD Environmental Outlook (OECD, 2008a),
corrected  for  population,  the  estimated  global  domestic  water  use  for  the  year 2000  is

263

5. WATER

around 350 km3, while the demand by the manufacturing sector is estimated to be around
230 km3.  For  the  manufacturing  sector  and  for  electricity  production,  OECD  2008
calculations were used as the starting point. While water use in different industrial sectors
can vary significantly, an overall average relationship with total industrial value added was
assumed per geographical region, according to assumed regional structure of the sector
and  technological  level.  Over  time  this  relationship  was  adapted  according  to  assumed
structural sector shifts and technological progress.

Box 5.A1. The LPJmL model: Calculating water demand, especially irrigation
The LPJmL model describes how water flows are influenced by precipitation, evaporation
from soil and water surfaces, and transpiration of plants, both natural and managed by
humans. A  water balance can  be established  for  each  grid  cell  (see Chapter 1), taking
account of land-use  patterns,  natural  vegetation, crop  distribution  and management,
climate  parameters  (temperature,  precipitation  and  CO2  concentration),  and  soil
parameters. This shows the resulting run-off per grid cell, i.e. the amount that ends up in
river systems, lakes and dams, and the volumes available for downstream extraction. The
demand for non-agricultural use of water is calculated at the world region level and down-
scaled to grid-cell level using the spatial distribution of people and GDP as a measure of
human activity. Together with demands for irrigation per grid-cell (see below), the run-off
is then corrected for the total withdrawals in the cell. The resulting run-off is passed on to
the next downstream cell and so on until the entire water basin is covered.

The  irrigation  water  requirement  is  calculated  by  comparing  the  amount  of  water
needed for unrestrained growth with the supply from precipitation. The gap is filled by
irrigation, using surface water and groundwater available in the same or neighbouring grid
cells.

Depending on the irrigation system in place and its management, the ratio can vary
between  the  water  effectively  contributing  to  soil  moisture  for  plant  growth  and  the
volume extracted from river systems. Open canal systems evaporate water and lose water
through canal walls, cracks, etc. Piped systems do not lose water through evaporation, but
by leaking through faults in joints and pipes. Another variation in efficiency is the method
of application on the field, for example sprinklers lose water via evaporation, interception
by leaves and drift; surface irrigation loses it to evaporation, surface run-off, non-uniform
soil wetting, etc. Drip irrigation close to the roots is the most efficient. In the LPJmL model,
estimates are made of the dominant systems in use in countries and regions, and their
typical efficiencies (Fader et al., 2010).

The largest global water demand after irrigated agriculture in 2000 was for electricity
generation, primarily for cooling of thermal (steam cycle-based) power generation. Based
on  rough  estimates,  the  global  water  use  for  electricity  was  around  540 km3  in 2000.
Differences of water use per unit of electricity produced between individual thermal power
plants can be significant, according to their overall efficiency (from less than 30% to around
60%), the type of plant (steam cycle or combined gas/steam cycle) and the cooling system
in  place  (once-through  or  closed-loop).  Hydropower  plants  are  assumed  to  return
withdrawn  water  back  to  the  river  after  use,  so  except  for  relatively  small  evaporative
losses from reservoirs they do not contribute to the water demand.

5. WATER

Finally, relatively small amounts of water are needed for livestock globally, estimated
at around 25 km3 in 2000. However, this can sometimes represent a large share of water
use locally. Breed varieties, diets and climate all influence water demand from this sector.

Uncertainties in calculating future irrigation demand

Future water demand for irrigation is driven by the change in irrigated area and by the
change  in  water use per area. Future projections on irrigation demand differ widely in the
literature. Irrigation is not only driven by biophysical and technical factors, but also by socio-
economic and governance factors (Neumann, 2010). For instance, low political stability and
low economic strength may reduce the options for irrigation, whereas a strong tradition
and  government  support  may  stimulate  it.  These  factors  are  hard  to  model.  Projections
published  in  the  literature  for  future  irrigation  demand  therefore  range  from  the  current
(uncertain)  level  to  plus  10%-20%  until  the  middle  of  the  century  (Alcamo et al.,  2007;
Bruinsma, 2003; Bruinsma, 2009; Fischer et al., 2007; Fraiture et al., 2007; Shen et al., 2008). For
example, Alcamo et al. (2007) computed several scenarios of future increase of irrigated land
which between 1995 and 2050 ranged between 0.4% and 9.7%. The resulting changes in global
irrigation water withdrawals are computed to range between –15.3% and +43.3% over the
same period.

The  Environmental  Outlook  Baseline  projection  assumes  constant  irrigated  area  and
constant  water  efficiency  outside  the  OECD  to 2050.  The  first  assumption  will  probably
underestimate irrigation water demand in 2030 and 2050 and the second assumption may
overestimate the demand outside the OECD.

There is a practical reason why the model framework used for the Outlook keeps the
future irrigated area at its current level. Changing the area would require the model to be
able  to  allocate  water  demand  for  irrigation  according  to  different  crops  and  actual
locations; this facility is currently not available. Even if the Environmental Outlook Baseline
projection  were  to  consider  a modest  expansion  of  irrigation,1 the  associated  growth  in
irrigation  water  demands  would  not  alter  the  total  demands  decisively.  These  are
increasingly determined by much faster growing demands for domestic and industrial use
and electricity production. Other projections of total water demands show a comparable
picture (Shen, 2008).

Data from Freydank (2008; also used for FAO projections) show that the area of arable
land  equipped  for  irrigation  grew  between 1900  and 2008  at  variable  growth  rates
(Figure 5.A1). However, despite being equipped, the area is often not irrigated for various
reasons  such  as  lack  of  water,  absence  of  farmers,  land  degradation,  damage  and
organisational  problems.  No  long-term  data  are  available  on  trends  of  the  area  actually
irrigated on which to base future projections.

FAO projections made in 2003 assumed an increase in the area equipped for irrigation
from  287 to 328 million  hectares  (Mha)  by 2030  (Bruinsma, 2003).  A  more  recent  FAO
projection (Bruinsma, 2009) reduced the expansion expected to 2030 to 310 Mha (+ 8%), and
practically no further increase through to 2050 (Figure 5.A1). All expansion is projected to
take place in emerging economies and developing countries.

Methods for projecting future demand range from using a simple rule of constant area
per  person  so  the  area  grows  with  population  (Shen, 2008),  to  more  sophisticated
approaches combining potential demand (the ratio of precipitation to evapotranspiration)
with  local  availability  of  water  resources  to  supply  irrigation  water  (Fischer, 2007).  Still

others assume investment strategies to meet future food demands through improvements
in  rainfed  and/or  irrigated  agriculture  by  targeting  either  area  expansion,  or  yield  and
water  productivity 
(Fraiture et al., 2007).  A  mixed  scenario  spreads
investments over the various measures, resulting in fairly limited expansion of irrigated
land (+16%) and water withdrawals (+13%).

Germany.

All  the  strategies  explored  by  Fraiture et al. (2007)  assume  significant  efforts  and
hundreds of billion dollars of investments. Expanding irrigation is relatively expensive and
less cost-effective than other investment strategies for increasing agricultural production
explored.  The  cheapest  option  is  enhanced  trade  in  agricultural  commodities,  so  that
production  in  regions  with  potential  for  rainfed  agriculture  increases  at  the  expense  of
irrigated agriculture. In their assessment this is the cheapest option, and would mean no
change  in  irrigated  area  and  only  a  minor  change  in  water  withdrawals  compared  with
today.

In addition to the extent, the current and projected amount of water withdrawn per
hectare of irrigated land is important for calculating total irrigation water demand. This
depends  on  crop  water  consumption,  the  gap  between  water  required  to  sustain  crop
growth and precipitation, and the irrigation and water transport system.

In  the  Outlook  projection,  efficiency  improvements  are  assumed  in  OECD  countries,
based on observed  trends under current policies. In other regions it is unclear if and  to
what  extent  similar  improvements  can  be  expected  in  the  absence  of  specific  policies,
hence the efficiency is kept constant per region, estimated on the basis of an analysis of
prevailing technology and management practices per region (LPJmL model, Fader, 2010).

Crop requirements can be influenced by climate change: a higher temperature induces
more evapotranspiration, and changes in (seasonal) precipitation can either decrease or
increase  the  irrigation  demand.  A  related  phenomenon  is  the  water-use  efficiency  of

266

5. WATER

plants, which increases in principle with more elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration.
The LPJ model assumes a relatively strong effect, but the strength of this mechanism is
under discussion among experts.

Transporting water for irrigation can result in a range of losses, such as over-watering,
leakage from canals or pipe systems, evaporation from uncovered canals and soil, spray
losses, etc. Estimates of global average losses range from 40% to over 50%.

Projections in other sectors

In  the  Outlook  Baseline,  demand  for  domestic  water  use  increases  by  a  factor  of
2.3 between 2000 and 2050. This is a faster growth rate than for the population, caused by
rising per capita disposable income and a larger share of the population being connected
to tap water supply systems. Industrial use grows by a factor of five over the same period,
following  a  more  than  sevenfold  increase  in  value  added.  Finally,  water  for  electricity
production is projected to increase by a factor of 2.5 through to 2050.

Water-specific hypotheses under the Resource Efficiency scenario

A simple “what-if” scenario approach was modelled to explore the potential to reduce
the  water  stress  observed  in  the  Outlook  Baseline  by  reducing  demand  (van  den  Berg
et al., 2011).

The assumptions made are as follows:

For irrigation, all non-OECD countries are assumed to improve their efficiency by 15%
more  than  in  the  Baseline.  This  is  based  on  Fischer et al. (2007),  who  extended  an  FAO
assumption  (Bruinsma, 2003)  of  a  10%  improvement  by 2030  to  reach  20%  by 2080.
Considering that the annual rate of improvement declines over time, this is consistent
with our assumption of a 15% efficiency improvement by 2050. Further efficiencies than
those assumed in the Baseline are considered less likely for OECD countries and therefore
this remains unchanged in this scenario; it is assumed that irrigation in the OECD in the
Baseline has reached an upper limit of efficiency as risks of salinisation and pollution
problems  are  associated  with  more  than  70%  evapotranspiration  of  irrigation  water
(Fraiture et al., 2007).

For domestic and manufacturing uses, it is assumed that water savings can be achieved
that are comparable to savings in energy consumption. Hence, compared to the Baseline,
the water demands in each region are reduced in proportion with the energy savings rate
in the Resource Efficiency scenario (van den Berg et al., 2011).

■ This  scenario  makes  the  same  assumptions  as  the  450 Core  scenario  explored  in  the
Climate  Change  chapter,  (for  details,  see Chapter 3,  Section 4).  Larger  shares  for  solar
and  wind-based  power  generation  versus  thermal  are  assumed,  but  until 2050  an
assumed  shift  to  (thermal)  bio-energy  and  nuclear  power  plants  limits  the  overall
reduction in this sector. The assumed reduction in energy demand described in the point
above translates directly into less water demand for cooling.

■ No adjustment was made for the livestock sector. Demand may well be reduced from
dietary and conversion efficiency improvements. But no attempt was made to quantify
the  effect  as  the  Baseline  demand  is  already  so  small  that  any  adjustment  will  be
negligible  compared  to  the  large  uncertainties  surrounding  each  of  the  much  larger
demand categories.

Finally,  in  the  (global)  Resource  Efficiency  scenario,  climate  change  is  well  below  the
Baseline, implying lower temperatures and atmospheric carbon dioxide levels compared
to the Baseline. Given the net response of the LPJmL model, this may result in slightly
higher demand for irrigation water. Differences up to 2050 are relatively limited however,
and are not quantified here.

As  a  result,  total  water  demands in 2050  could  be  reduced  by  some  25%  under  this
scenario, from 5 465 km3 in the Baseline to 4 140 km3. The largest difference between the
Baseline  and  this  scenario  is  brought  about  by  reducing  water  demand  from  electricity
generation  (down  by  37%  in 2050),  followed  by  domestic  and  manufacturing  demands
(each down by nearly 30%).

Nutrient effluents from wastewater

Nutrient flows in urban wastewater were calculated using the approach presented by
van Drecht et al. (2009). Human nitrogen (N) emission is the N emitted in wastewater by
households and industries that are connected to the same sewerage system. The overall
approach for calculating human N emission that is actually discharged into surface water
is as follows:

wastewater treatment (no dimension). The total P emission to surface water is calculated
as:

detergents are entirely based on GDP.
Removal of N and P through wastewater 
treatment plants will increase by a gradual shift 
to a higher technological treatment classes. 
The removal efficiency per class remains 
constant; 50% of each treatment class shifts 
toward the next in line in the 
period 2000-2030 and another 50% 
in 2030-2050 (50% of “no treatment” is 
replaced by mechanical; 50% of mechanical 
treatment is replaced by biological; 50% of 
biological is replaced by advanced treatment).

rapid decrease in the use of P fertiliser to levels comparable to Europe and North America
is assumed, thus reducing emissions to surface water. In countries with nutrient deficits, it
is  assumed  that  nutrient  discharges  to  surface  water  will  gradually  increase  due  to
increasing fertiliser use.

Total surpluses are calculated on the basis of all inputs. N inputs include biological N
fixation (Nfix), atmospheric N deposition (Ndep), application of synthetic N fertiliser (Nfert)
and animal manure (Nman). Outputs in the soil N budget include N withdrawal from the
field  through  crop  harvesting,  hay  and  grass  cutting,  and  grass  consumed  by  grazing
animals (Nwithdr). The soil N budget (Nbudget) was calculated as follows:

Nbudget = Nfix + Ndep + Nfert + Nman – Nwithdr 

(1)

A positive value for the budget indicates a surplus, and a negative value indicates a
deficit. For P the same approach was used, P inputs being animal manure and fertiliser. A
surplus  represents  a  potential  loss  to  the  environment;  for  N,  this  includes  NH3
volatilisation,  denitrification,  surface  run  off  and  leaching;  for  P,  it  refers  to  run  off  and
accumulation  of  nutrients  in  the  soil.  Negative  budgets  indicate  soil  N  or  P  depletion.
Details on the various terms in equation (1) and the uncertainties can be found in recent
peer-reviewed articles (Bouwman et al., 2009; 2011).

Livestock  production  plays  a  major  role  in  the  nutrient  budgets  for  cropland.  An
increase in livestock production will cause an increase of manure storage and availability
for spreading in croplands, and is therefore an important driver of the increases of N and P

budgets  in  croplands.  Production  of  animal  manure  is  a  result  of  livestock  production
increase, intensification and productivity increase. The contribution of animal manure to
total N budget of croplands is only 6%-14% in OECD countries, while it is up to 50% in some
African countries. In India, animals contribute 38% to total N supply, and in China 18%.
Similar to croplands, the uses of grasslands by ruminants also involves the development of
surpluses. This is because losses of N by NH3 volatilisation, denitrification and leaching are
inevitable. For P, the build up of residual soil P by adsorption to soil material causes the
development of surpluses.

In  the  FAO  study  (Bruinsma, 2003)  assumptions  of  the  fertiliser  use  efficiency  were
based on economic and agronomic considerations, and the soil and climatic conditions of
the country considered. The use of fertiliser may change as a result of production increase
and efficiency changes.

Various  ways  to  analyse  efficiency  of  nutrient  use  are  available  (Ladha et al., 2005).
This Environmental Outlook uses the concept of apparent fertiliser N and P use efficiency
(NUE and PUE, respectively), which represents the production in kg dry matter per kg of
fertiliser N or P (Dobermann and Cassman, 2004 and 2005; Bouwman et al., 2009). This is
the broadest measure of N and P use efficiency, also called the “partial factor productivity”
of  the  applied  fertiliser  N  (Dobermann  and  Cassman,  2004 and 2005).  NUE  and  PUE
incorporate  the  contributions  of  indigenous  soil  N,  fertiliser  uptake  efficiency  and  the
efficiency  of  conversion  of  uptake  to  harvested  product.  NUE  and  PUE  vary  among
countries  because  of  differences  in  the  crop  mix,  their  attainable  yield  potential,  soil
quality, amount and form of N and P application and management. For example, very high
values  in  many  African  and  Latin  American  countries  reflect  current  low  fertiliser
application rates; NUE and PUE values are much lower in many industrialised countries
with intensive, high-input agricultural systems. In contrast, countries in Eastern Europe
and  the  former  Soviet  Union  had  a  rapid  decrease  in  fertiliser  use  after 1990,  causing  a
strong apparent increase in the fertiliser use efficiency.

In  the  Baseline  scenario,  generally  farmers  in  countries  with  nutrient  surplus  are
motivated to use fertiliser increasingly efficiently. For China it is assumed that there will be
a rapid decrease of the use of P fertilisers to PUE levels comparable to Europe and North
America,  and  in  both  China  and  India  further  decreases  up  until 2050,  thus  reducing
emissions to surface water. In countries with nutrient deficits, it is assumed that nutrient
discharges to surface water will gradually increase due to increasing fertiliser use.

See Section 3 of Chapter 2 on socio-economic developments, and Box 3.2 in Chapter 3

on climate change for assumptions on developments in agriculture.

Nutrient Recycling and Reduction scenario

Nutrient effluents from wastewater

It  is  assumed  that  the  urine  from  25%  of  the  population  with  a  sewage  connection
in 2030 and 50% in 2050 will be collected and recycled in agriculture. A gradual replacement
of P-based detergents to P-free ones between 2030 and 2050 is also assumed (Table 5.A1).

The potential for P recycling is much larger. Total P removal in wastewater treatment
amounted  to  0.7 million  tonnes  a  year  in 2000,  which  was  assumed  to  increase  to
1.7 million tonnes a year in 2030 and 3.3 million tonnes in 2050. Using this removed P to
produce  fertiliser could  provide  15%  of  the  projected P  needed  in agriculture  (22 million

270

5. WATER

tonnes  a  year  in 2050).  However,  this  would  imply  considerable  efforts  to  remove  heavy
metals, pharmaceuticals and other chemicals from sewage sludge.

Nutrient effluents from agriculture

This  scenario  involves  combining  different  strategies  in  the  crop  and  livestock

production system to improve both productivity and nutrient use efficiency, as follows:

In crop production systems the yield increase is assumed to be 40% higher than in the
Baseline. A larger production per unit area is assumed, and thus a smaller harvested area
than  in  the  Baseline.  This  could  be  achieved  if  fertiliser  use  as  well  as  fertiliser  use
efficiencies were higher than in the Baseline; it is assumed that half of the yield increase
originates from increased fertiliser use and half from improved crop varieties and better
management practices, leading to higher efficiencies.

■ Major changes  are also  assumed in  the livestock  sector. Compared to  the Baseline the

following modifications were made:

❖ Production  in  mixed  and  intensive  production  systems  is  10%  larger,  and  thus

production in pastoral systems 10% smaller.

❖ Feed  conversion  rates  (feed  use  in  kg  per  kg  of  product)  in  mixed  and  industrial

production systems are 10% lower.

❖ Productivity  in  mixed  and  industrial  systems  is  10%  higher  (milk  production  per

animal per year, and carcass weight of ruminants).

❖ Off-take rates (fraction of animal stock that is slaughtered) is 10% higher.

❖ The fraction of concentrates in feed rations is 18% higher (3% to 10% in industrialised
countries, and up to 65% increase in developing countries where use of concentrates
is currently limited).

All these modifications have an effect on the use of different feedstuffs, including feed
crops. This is accounted for in the IMAGE model. The result of this set of strategies is an
improved  N and P  efficiency,  and  on  top  of  the  improvement  in  the  Baseline,  N and P
excretion rates are assumed to be 90% of those in the Baseline.

■ A  final  strategy  is  to  better  integrate  animal  manure  in  crop  production,  leading  to  a

reduction in the use of fertiliser.

People and assets value at risk of water-related disasters

The  Environmental  Outlook  Baseline  assumes  that  climate  change  will  (still)  not  be  a
dominant  driver  of  the  occurrence  of  flood  disasters  in 2050.  This  is  based  on  the  IPCC
Special Report Managing the Risks of Extreme  Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change
Adaptation (IPCC, 2011). Laurens Bouwer also shows that in the next 40 years, increases in
population and GDP by far prevail over climate change as causes of increased risk of flood
disasters (Bouwer, 2011).

For  the  Outlook  analysis  presented  in  Section 2 on  water-related  disasters,  a  static
flood  map  has  been  combined  with  dynamic  maps  of  the  population  and  GDP  for 2010
and 2050. The following data were used to map potential inundated areas:

the detailed Dartmouth Flood Database (satellite images): http://floodobservatory.colorado.edu/;

floodplains from the Global Lakes and Wetlands Database (Lehner and Döll, 2004);

5. WATER

■ Spaceshuttle  Radar  Topographic  Mission  Digital  Elevation  Map  for  low  coastal  zones
which  might  be  inundated  by  the  sea  (coastal  zones  were  selected  at  an  elevation  of
maximum 5 metres above sea level): www2.jpl.nasa.gov/srtm/.

These three maps were aggregated into one map. The main uncertainty in this map is
that it has no return period and no inundation depth in it. The theoretical return period is
the inverse of the probability that the event will be exceeded in any one year. For example, a
10-year flood (return period) has a 1 in 10 = 0.1 or 10% chance of being exceeded in any one
year and a  50-year flood  has a 1 in 50 = 0.02 or  2% chance  of  being  exceeded  in  any  one
year.2

Data on population and GDP were derived from PBL’s GISMO model (see Annex 6.A in
Chapter 6 on  health  and  environment).  The  urban  and  rural  population  data  based  on
GRUMP are available for 2010 and 2050. The GDP is based on the purchasing power parity
(PPP) per capita on a national level. The PPP is used as an approximation of the value of
goods at a certain location in order to estimate value of losses from flood risks.

In order to combine the population with the more detailed flooding data, the GISMO
results were downscaled from 0.5 by 0.5 degrees to 30 by 30 arcseconds. The GRUMP3 urban
and rural extent dataset, in combination with Landscan 2007 population data, were used to
allocate  the  urban  and  rural  population  in  the  downscaling  process.  The  GDP  was
downscaled and regionalised using the downscaled population data and the PPP per capita.
Concerning the downscaling from cells of 0.5 degrees to cells of 30 arcseconds, the greatest
uncertainty is in assigning population to grid cells using GRUMP and fractions based on the
Landscan  population 2007.  Hence,  population  growth  is  projected  to  be  within  current
urban areas; expansion of urban areas is not included, and neither is the development of
new cities. Using the GDP based on PPP per nation is just an approximation of the real value
of buildings, infrastructure and goods at certain locations within a country.

To calculate the most vulnerable cities the results of population and value at risk were
combined with a world cities map. All cells were ranked from 0 to 1 based on the absolute
number of people at risk (highest risk is ranked as 1) and the absolute GDP at risk as a proxy
for adaptive capacity (lowest GDP is ranked as 1). Both ranking results were summed. This
resulted in a list of the cities most vulnerable to floods, i.e. those with a high score on both
the ranking of population and value at risk.

Water supply and sanitation

Levels of water supply and sanitation were modelled separately for urban and rural
populations  by  applying  regressions  based  on  available  data  for 1990  and 2000  (WHO/
UNICEF, 2008).  The  explanatory  variables  include  GDP  per  capita,  urbanisation  rate  and
population density. Region-specific parameters are included using calibration.

The associated costs for the projected connection rates are based on Hutton and Haller
(2004), who estimated annual costs for various levels of connection rates. Their annualised
cost  assumptions  are  based  on  investment  and  recurrent  costs,  using  values  from  the
literature.  For  example,  the  annual  costs  for  in-house  piped  water  are  USD 10-15 per
person, while other improved water supply connections range from USD 1-4 per person. It
is important to note that the costs in this simulation are approximate since the categories
and regions do not fully match those of Hutton and Haller. In addition, translating initial
investment costs to annual  costs  might  underestimate  the  costs  when  using them over
time.

Health and Environment

by

Richard Sigman, Henk Hilderink (PBL), Nathalie Delrue, 

Nils-Axel Braathen, Xavier Leflaive

This chapter examines the current and projected impacts on human health of four
key  environmental  factors  –  air  pollution  (focusing  on  premature  deaths  from
exposure to outdoor airborne particulate matter, or PM, and ground-level ozone as
well as indoor air pollution), unsafe water supply and poor sanitation (including in
the context of the relevant Millennium Development Goals or MDGs), chemicals
(chemical  hazards,  exposure)  and climate  change (focusing  on  the incidence of
malaria). For each issue the chapter first describes the current trends, then how the
picture could look in 2050 without new policies (the Environmental Outlook’s
Baseline scenario), and finally the policy actions required. Air pollution, unsafe
water supply, poor sanitation and hazardous chemicals exert significant pressures
on human health, particularly for the elderly and the young. While some global
trends (e.g. access to improved water sources) are getting better, others – such as
urban air pollution and lack of access to basic sanitation – continue to pose a serious
risk to human health. In addition, the incremental effects of climate change are
contributing to the global burden of disease. Ambitious and flexible abatement
policies  (e.g.  standards,  fuel  taxes,  chemical  testing  and  assessment,  green
procurement, cap-and-trade emissions trading, transport policies) as well as further
investment in water and  sanitation services are needed to address these risks.
Identified hazards need to be assessed and tackled, and there is also a need to be
vigilant and react quickly to new and emerging risks to human health that are not
well understood (e.g. endocrine disrupters, manufactured nanomaterials).

KEY MESSAGES

Air  pollution,  unsafe  water  supply,  poor  sanitation  and  hazardous  chemicals  exert  significant

pressures on human health, particularly the elderly and the young. While some global trends (e.g. access
to improved water sources) are getting better, others – such as urban air pollution and lack of access to
basic sanitation – continue to pose a serious risk to human health. In addition, the incremental effects of
climate change are contributing to the global burden of disease. Ambitious and flexible abatement policies
are needed to address these risks. Identified hazards need to be assessed and tackled, and there is also a
need  to  be  vigilant  and  react  quickly  to  new  and  emerging  risks  to  human  health  that  are  not  well
understood (e.g. electromagnetic fields, endocrine disrupters and manufactured nanomaterials).

Trends and projections
Air pollution

If no new policies are implemented, the OECD Environmental Outlook Baseline scenario projects that
urban air quality will continue to deteriorate globally. By 2050, outdoor air pollution is projected to
become the top cause of environmentally related deaths worldwide (see figure below).

Air pollution concentrations in some cities, particularly in Asia, are already far above acceptable
health standards. This situation is likely to continue and significant reduction efforts will be needed to
reduce their effects on health.
The number of premature deaths from exposure to particulate matter (PM) worldwide is likely to
more than double to 3.6 million in 2050 under the Baseline, mostly in China and India, with increasing
urbanisation and population ageing (leading to more susceptible people) likely to outstrip the benefits
of any emission reductions. The absolute number of premature deaths linked to ground-level ozone
in 2050 is also likely to be highest in China and India. However, OECD countries are likely to have one
of the highest ozone-related mortality rates in terms of number of deaths per million inhabitants –
second only after India – due to the much greater ageing of the population in the region.

Substantial increases in sulphur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions are likely to
occur in the key emerging economies in the coming decades. Compared to the year 2000, emission
levels of SO2 are projected to be 90% higher and NOx 50% higher in 2050.
With rising income and living standards, the number of people using traditional (and more polluting)
solid  fuels  for  cooking  and  heating  is  projected  to  decline  after 2020,  implying  a  reduction  in
premature  deaths  from  indoor  air  pollution.  However,  it  might  become  more  difficult  for  poor
households to move away from these polluting traditional energy sources, (e.g. firewood) if climate
change policies increase energy prices. Targeted measures to provide alternative clean energy (e.g.
efficient cook stoves) for poor households will therefore be needed.
OECD air emissions of SO2, NOx and black carbon (precursors to PM and ozone pollution) are expected
to continue to fall in the coming decades. 

Unsafe water supply and poor sanitation

Child mortality from diarrhoea – caused by unsafe water supply and poor sanitation – is projected to
decrease to 2050. However, Sub-Saharan Africa will lag behind most other regions, particularly due to
lack of access to adequate sanitation.

Hazardous chemicals

The global burden of disease attributable to exposure to hazardous chemicals is already significant
and is likely to be more serious than the available data indicate. This burden falls more heavily on non-
OECD countries, where people are at greater risk of exposure to hazardous chemicals and waste and
where the OECD Environmental Outlook Baseline projects a six-fold increase in chemical production
by 2050.
While OECD governments continue to make good progress collecting and assessing information on
human  exposure  to  individual  chemicals  throughout  their  lifecycle,  knowledge  gaps  still  exist
concerning  the  health  effects  from  thousands of  chemicals  present  in  the  environment.  More
information on potential exposures to chemicals in products and in the environment, as well as the
adverse effects of combined human exposure to multiple chemicals is needed.

Many OECD governments have changed, or are in the process of changing, national legislation to
expand their regulatory coverage of chemicals, but enforcement is still incomplete.

Incidence of malaria from climate change

Climate change will mean that a greater number of people will be living in malaria risk areas in 2050.
Despite this, global premature mortality from malaria is projected to decrease to 2050 under the
Baseline scenario, due to greater urbanisation and increased per-capita income. Even so, it is projected
that Africa will suffer around 400 000 premature deaths in 2050 from malaria. 

Policy options and needs
■ Curb  the  growing  health  impacts  of  air  pollution  through  more  ambitious  and  targeted  regulatory
standards and economic instruments, such as taxes on polluting activities. An urgent policy priority is
to reduce the sources of particulate air pollutants in non-OECD countries, especially emissions from
transportation.

■ Reduce  motor  vehicle  emissions  through  policy  mixes  which  include  taxes  and  regulations,  and
promoting cleaner public transport. Encourage behavioural changes in business models and lifestyle
(e.g. car sharing, teleconferencing, teleworking).

OECD ENVIRONMENTAL OUTLOOK TO 2050 © OECD 2012

277

6. HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENT

■ Maximise synergies between local air pollution abatement and climate change mitigation policies.
Outlook modelling suggests that measures to cut conventional air pollution (NOx, SO2 and black carbon)
by up to 25% could also reduce CO2 emissions by 5% in 2030 compared to the Baseline. Air pollution
abatement through structural measures (e.g. shifts in energy sources and demand) will have more co-
benefits for climate-related emissions than end-of-pipe measures.

■ Scale  up  investment  in  water  supply  and  sanitation.  The  benefit-to-cost  ratios  can  be  as  high  as

7 to 1 in developing countries.
Improve the knowledge base. This includes doing more to harmonise data; improving methodologies
for determining environmental burdens of disease and the cost and benefits of policies to address risks
to human health; improving our understanding of chemical hazards; collecting more data on exposures
to chemicals from production to use and final disposal; and keeping the public informed by making
chemical information widely available through the Internet and other sources.
Intensify international co-operation in the management of chemicals. This includes work sharing on
the assessment of chemicals and development of methodologies for assessing existing, emerging or
poorly-understood issues (e.g. endocrine disrupters, nanomaterials and chemical mixtures); increasing
the sustainable use of chemicals and green chemistry; and implementing policies to protect the most
vulnerable human life stages (i.e. early life).

1. Introduction

This chapter examines the current and projected impacts on human health of four key
environmental factors – air pollution, unsafe water supply and poor sanitation, chemicals and
climate change. It begins with an overview of the combined impacts of these challenges, and
then each of the four environmental health issues is discussed in turn – first to describe the
current trends, then how the picture could look in 2050 without new policies (the Environmental
Outlook’s Baseline scenario – see Chapter 1), and finally the policy actions required. 

The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that today, outdoor and indoor air
pollution, unsafe water supply and poor sanitation, and the effects of climate change are
responsible for around 8%-9% of global premature deaths and “burden of disease” (Box 6.1),
and almost 25% of global premature deaths and burden of disease in children under five
years of age (WHO, 2009a). Most of the deaths occur in low-and middle-income countries,
while  for  higher  income  countries  the  main  environmental  risk  is  local  air  pollution
(Table 6.1).

Other environmental risks also affect health. Radon, a naturally occurring gas which is
released from the ground, causes between 6% and 15% of all lung cancers (WHO, 2005).
Loss  of biodiversity (discussed in Chapter 4) reduces  opportunities for  developing  new
medicines  and  drugs,  many  of  which  are  based  on,  or  come  directly  from,  natural
compounds found in plants and animals. Micropollutants – industrial compounds detected
in aquatic systems in low concentrations (e.g. antibiotics) – are a growing source of concern
(see Box 5.4 in Chapter 5). Noise also affects human health, while public concern has been
expressed about possible impacts from exposure to electromagnetic fields. Environmental
pollution affects human health in a variety of ways, from contaminating food crops to
exposing wildlife such as fish to harmful substances which accumulate in the food chain.

Public health is influenced not only by environmental hazards but also – particularly
in  developing  countries –  by  social  and  economic  factors  including  high  population

6. HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENT

densities,  poor  education,  inadequate  health  care  systems,  low  per-capita  income,
increasing urbanisation, inadequate living and working standards and access to health
care, and displaced and disadvantaged populations. Environmental health threats may be
felt more acutely in some countries (and some communities within countries) which lack
the political and economic resources to combat such threats.

Average health care costs in OECD countries rose from 7.7% in 1999 to 9.6% in 2009 as
a  percentage  of  GDP  (OECD, 2011a).  Total  public  and  private  pollution  abatement  and
control expenditures in OECD countries range from about 1 to 2.5% of GDP (OECD, 2007).
While it is difficult to estimate what portion of heath care expenditures are associated with
exposure to environmental pollutants, it is reasonable to assume that the health care costs
of addressing impacts from environmental exposure have also risen. It is important to
note that it is often cost-efficient to improve environmental conditions in order to prevent
negative environmental health impacts.

Populations most susceptible to the effects of pollution 

The  elderly  and  children  –  from in  utero  through  adolescence –  are  particularly
susceptible to environmental pollution. Worldwide, the per-capita number of healthy life
years lost to environmental risk factors is about five times greater in children under five years
of age than in the total population (Prüss-Üstün and Corvalàn, 2006). In addition, an increasing
number of epidemiological studies suggest that prenatal exposure to food contaminants, air
pollutants and chemicals in consumer  products  are  associated  with  non-genetically
transmitted adverse health effects which appear after birth (Schoeters et al., 2011). 

Children are more susceptible to air pollution owing to their different physiological,
metabolic factors and activity levels compared to adults. Children breathe more per unit of
body weight than adults, have smaller airways and lungs and immature host defence
mechanisms. Children also have different rates of toxification and detoxification, and have
greater exposure to air pollutants as they spend more time outdoors and ventilate more, due
to play and exercise. The elderly are also at high risk due to the deterioration of biochemical
and physiological processes that make them more susceptible to lung infections in particular.

Demographic shifts

Globally, the proportion of elderly people in the population is expected to increase due
to declining birth rates and health improvements (see Chapter 2 for more information).
The proportion of people aged 65 years and older is projected to increase from 7.6% in 2010
to 16.3% in 2050, and of those aged 75 years and older from 3% in 2020 to 7.5% in 2050. In
absolute terms this implies an increase of almost 1 billion people over the age of 65. Most
of the increase in the number of elderly is expected to take place in India and China. Over
the same period, globally the proportion of children (0-14 years) is projected to decrease
from 26.9% to 19.6%, which equates to around 1.8 billion people; however, even by 2050, the
number of children in Sub-Saharan Africa will still make up 28.4% of the population.

Identifying and predicting environmental impacts on public health

Recent  years  have  seen  increasing  sophistication  in  the  systematic  collection,
integration, analysis and evaluation of data collected from public health surveillance and
environmental hazard monitoring. Many countries are conducting large and comprehensive
epidemiology  studies,  focusing  in  particular  on  early  life  stage  exposure,  to  better
characterise links between exposure and human health effects. In addition, testing and

280

6. HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENT

assessment of chemicals is moving towards an integrated approach including the use of
predictive  models  such  as  Quantitative  Structure-Activity  Relationship  –  or  (Q)SARs
models. New technologies and promising alternatives to traditional chemical testing are
also being developed, such as in vitro high-throughput tests and toxicogenomics (the study
of gene activity using bioinformatic techniques). These new techniques may allow better,
cheaper and quicker identification of potential environmental hazards from chemicals.

Current approaches for determining the environmental burden of disease and evaluating
policy options to address identified hazards (e.g. cost-benefit analysis) are important tools used
by many governments and international organisations. However, such approaches suffer from
large uncertainties about environmental impacts on health – more research is needed into
methodologies for quantifying and comparing these impacts (Box 6.1).

Box 6.1. Measurement challenges

Disease burden is the impact of a health problem in an area. It is usually measured by
indicators such as mortality (death) and morbidity (disease, disability, or poor health). It is
often quantified in terms of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) or disability-adjusted life years
(DALYs). The DALY is a measure of overall disease burden, expressed as the number of years
lost  due to ill-health, disability or early  death.  This  combines the burden  due to both
mortality and morbidity into one index, allowing for the comparison of the disease burden
due to various risk factors or diseases. It also makes it possible to predict the possible
impact of health interventions. However, estimates of disease burden involve uncertainty.
For instance, estimates of cancer may be based on simple assumptions, and the effects of
chemicals on the endocrine system may not be considered in burden estimates. Further,
certain  methods  for  estimating  disease  burden  (e.g. disability  weighting  and  age
discounting) are subject to debate, as is the comparability of some data collected across
countries. In addition, DALYs figures have only been calculated for substances for which
there are known dose-response functions and measurable endpoints. Thus, it is important
to account for model uncertainty when reviewing disease burden estimations.

While economic valuation studies of health impacts from pollution tend to focus more
on  the  number  of  deaths  (mortality),  the  frequency  of  illness  linked  to  pollution
(morbidity) is typically much greater and should be an important element of assessments.

2. Air pollution

Impacts on human health

This section looks at both outdoor and indoor air pollution, both of which can have
significant impacts on human health. The most serious types of outdoor air pollution for
human health are airborne particulate matter1 (PM) and ground-level ozone.

Particulate matter

PM can be divided into two types: i) primary particulates: matter emitted directly to
the  atmosphere,  such  as  black  carbon  (see Box 6.3);  and  ii)  secondary  particulates:
particulates formed in the atmosphere from a reaction involving precursor gases, primarily
ammonia,  nitrogen  oxides  (NOx),  sulphur  dioxide  (SO2)  and,  to  some  degree,  volatile
organic compounds (VOCs).

6. HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENT

The  effects  of  particulate  matter  can  range  from  eye  and  respiratory  irritation  to
cardiovascular disease, lung cancer and  consequent premature death. The particles of
most concern are in the finer fractions, PM10 and especially PM2.5, as these particles are
small enough to be able to penetrate deeply into the lungs. Globally, 8% of lung cancer
deaths, 5% of cardiopulmonary deaths and around 3% of respiratory infection deaths can
be  attributed  to  exposure  to  fine  particulate  matter  only  (WHO, 2009a).  There  are  an
estimated  299 400 premature  deaths  in  China  and  119 900 in  India  each  year  from
exposure to PM10 (WHO, 2009c; 2009d). 

The WHO has set air quality guidelines and three interim targets to help countries
with high PM concentrations to gradually improve their air quality (Table 6.2). However, at
the levels of the “Interim Target 1”, there would be an estimated 15% higher long-term
mortality than at the WHO Air Quality Guideline level.

Ground-level ozone

Ground-level  or  tropospheric  ozone  is  formed  in  the  atmosphere  by  a  chemical
reaction between precursor gases such as NOx, VOCs and methane, and sunlight. Ozone
occurs  in  significant  quantities  as  both  a  pollutant  and  a  natural  component  of  the
atmosphere.  At  higher  elevations,  ozone  screens  out  harmful  ultraviolet  radiation.
However, close to the ground ozone is harmful to human health, vegetation and some
materials.  There  is  a complex  relationship between ozone and  nitrogen  oxides; under
some conditions, emissions of NOx will lead to ozone formation, while under others they
will lead to a reduction in local ozone levels. 

Exposure to high levels of ozone can damage lung function, inflame airways and cause
cardiovascular health problems. In Europe, exposure to ozone concentrations is linked to more
than 20 000 premature deaths each year (EEA, 2010). While the European Union, the United
States, and other OECD countries have been regulating emissions of ozone precursors, higher
ground-level ozone formation from precursor emissions in Asia and Africa in the future will
likely increase these regions’ mortality and morbidity rates in the absence of abatement
policies (The Royal Society, 2008).

The precursors of ozone, such as VOCs, can also affect health directly, for example
from exposure to solvents and benzene. Human exposure to precursors of PM and ozone
depends  on  specific  local  conditions  and  thus  is  not  modelled  on  a  global  scale  or
quantified in this report.

The main sources of ground-level ozone and PM pollutants and their precursors are:

the energy sector: black carbon, NOx and sulphur oxides;
transportation: black carbon, NOx, VOCs, PM2.5;

6. HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENT

■ household burning of coal and wood: black carbon and PM2.5;
■ animal  husbandry,  waste  and  wastewater  treatment  and  emissions  from  rice  paddies:

methane. 

The concentrations of ozone and particulate matter are influenced both by long-range
transport of air pollutants and their precursors, as well as local emissions of these pollutants.
Air pollutants emitted from one location can have an impact elsewhere on the globe,
depending on their travel distances and residence times. Particulate matter can travel as far as
1 000 km, while the precursors of ozone show an even wider range. Nitrogen oxides can travel
up to 10 km, while carbon monoxide and methane can travel over 10 000 km and 1 million km
respectively and can remain in the atmosphere for 3 months and 8-10 years respectively.
These features make these pollutants a global problem. 

The UNECE (United Nations Economic Commission for Europe) has found an increasing
trend in ozone concentrations measured in remote sites in the Northern Hemisphere which
suggests that hemispheric baseline ozone concentrations have increased by a factor of two
during the latter half of the twentieth century, most likely due to increases in anthropogenic
emissions of ozone precursors (UNECE, 2010). Model calculations demonstrate that a reduction
of 20% in anthropogenic emissions in North America, East Asia and South Asia would reduce
the background ozone level in Europe by 0.6 parts per billion (ppb), which is similar to the
0.8 ppb reduction that would be achieved from a 20% fall in European emissions. Reducing
anthropogenic methane emissions globally by 50% would nearly halve the incidence of high-
ozone events in the United States (Fiore et al., 2002).

Indoor air pollution

Human health is also affected by exposure to indoor air pollution (Box 6.4). The most
significant source is burning of traditional solid fuels such as coal and biomass (e.g. cow
dung and wood) for indoor cooking and heating by households which cannot afford cleaner
fuels. Each year an estimated 2 million people die prematurely from indoor air pollution,
almost half of them are children affected by lower respiratory infections or pneumonia; the
other million are due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), primarily in the
elderly. These deaths are most prevalent in low- and medium-income countries (about
64%)  –  particularly  in  Southeast  Asia  and  Africa.  About  28%  of  them  occur  in  China
(WHO, 2009a). But indoor air pollution is also a concern in developed countries, mainly
from releases of chemicals from carpets, furniture and household cleaning products, as
well as radon (see above) and pesticides.

Key trends and projections in air pollution

This section presents results from the OECD Environmental Outlook Baseline scenario,
which models the likely trend in mortality rates from exposure to particulate matter (PM10
and PM2.5) and ground-level ozone up until 2050, assuming that there will be no new policy
interventions put in place. These estimates are based on:

regional emissions and urban concentrations of PM for 3 245 “major cities”, i.e cities with
populations of over 100 000 or national capitals (World Bank, 2001);2
ground-level ozone concentrations derived at the global level and then downscaled to
regions using the geographical-specific ozone projections of the European Commission’s
Ispra Joint Research Centre (van Aardenne et al., 2010).

6. HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENT

The modelling of urban air pollution (PM) is based on several assumptions which may lead
to uncertainty in the results (see Box 6.A1 in the annex to this chapter for more information).

Emissions of SO2, NOx and black carbon

Under the OECD Environmental Outlook Baseline, OECD emissions of SO2, NOx and black
carbon are expected to continue a downward trend to 2050 (Figure 6.1), with the exception
of  OECD  emissions  of  black  carbon,  where  a  slight  increase  is  expected  until 2015.
Substantial  increases  in  emissions  of  SO2  and  NOx  are  projected  in the  key  emerging
economies of Brazil, Russia, India, Indonesia, China and South Africa (the BRIICS) driven by
a growth in economic activity in the next two decades, especially in the energy sector.
Emissions will then stabilise at around two times the 2000 level by 2050 (for SO2) and one
and  a  half  times  (for NOx)  due  to  increasing  uptake  of  cleaner  fuels  and  combustion
technologies  driven  by  rising  income  levels.  In  the  rest  of  the  world  group  (RoW),  a
significant increase in SO2 and NOx is expected and this is unlikely to level off by 2050.
Emissions of black carbon are projected to drop significantly in the BRIICS and to stabilise
in the RoW over the next four decades.

PM and ozone concentrations

The OECD Environmental Outlook Baseline has projected the annual average atmospheric
concentrations of PM10  for cities with populations over 100 000 between 2010 and 2050
(Figure 6.2). Overall, the average concentrations in all regions are already higher than the
WHO Air Quality Guideline of 20 µg/m3 (Table 6.2), and this will still be the case in 2050.
While concentrations in OECD countries are expected to slowly decline, concentrations in
the BRIICS, in total, are projected to rise until 2030 before declining slightly by 2050. Within
the  BRIICS,  Brazil,  Russia  and  China  are  likely  to  see a  slight  decrease  by 2030.
Concentrations in  the  large  cities  in the rest of the world  are expected  to continue  to
increase over this period. It should be noted that the concentrations presented here are
weighted averages and that for several countries within a region (e.g. Canada and New
Zealand for the OECD region) concentrations are below the WHO Air Quality Guideline.

Today,  only  2%  of  the  global  urban  population  are  living  with  acceptable
PM10 concentrations (i.e. below  the WHO Air  Quality Guideline of 20 µg/m3;  Figure 6.3).
Approximately 70% of the urban population in the BRIICS and RoW countries are exposed
to concentrations above the highest interim standard (above 70 µg/m3). In 2050, the Baseline
projects that the percentage of people living in cities with concentrations above the highest

WHO target of 70 µg/m3 will be even higher in all regions. This is despite the air quality
improvements projected to 2050 in OECD countries and the BRIICS, as these improvements
are expected to be eclipsed by population growth in urban areas.

Similarly, the Baseline scenario projects concentrations of ground-level ozone in cities
with populations over 100 000 to continue to rise significantly to 2050 globally; by 35% in
OECD, about 90% in Russia and 39% in China (Figure 6.4) when compared to 2010 levels.

Projected health impacts from PM and ozone pollution

The OECD Environmental Outlook Baseline projects the number  of premature deaths
associated with exposure to PM10 and PM2.5  to increase from just over 1 million worldwide
in 2000 to over 3.5 million in 2050 (Figure 6.5, Panel A). Most of this increase is expected to
be in the BRIICS. This represents a significant portion of the world’s urban population

Box 6.2. Factors behind the increase in premature deaths from exposure to urban 

PM air pollution

Estimating the health impacts of air  pollution is complex. Various factors – such as
population growth, population ageing, urbanisation, declining air quality and overall health
improvements – influence the burden of disease associated with air pollution, both mortality
and morbidity (see Box 6.1). As part of the modeling for the Baseline scenario, an analysis was
conducted to determine the degree to which each factor influences the mortality component of
the burden of disease over the next 40 years. 

This found that expected improvements in health services driven by rising income levels over
this period would halve the number of deaths caused by air pollution – all else being constant –
but population growth and greater urbanisation would offset this reduction. The factor which
exerted the greatest influence on the increase in premature deaths from air pollution was the
ageing of populations in the OECD, BRIICS and the RoW countries.

exposed to air pollution – urgent action is needed to reverse this trend. Even after adjusting
for its population size, China already has the highest rate of premature deaths linked to PM
pollution per million inhabitants; with the future ageing of the population, this rate is
expected  to  more than double  by 2050  if  no new  policies are  implemented (Figure 6.5,
Panel B). While the estimated premature death rates are lower in India and Indonesia, they
are projected to triple by 2050, due to increased PM concentrations and also due to the
larger number of people exposed through increasing urbanisation and population ageing
(see Box 6.2).

The  Baseline  scenario  projects  the  absolute  number  of  premature  deaths  from
exposure to ground-level ozone to more than double worldwide (from 385 000 to nearly
800 000) between 2010 and 2050 (Figure 6.6, Panel A). Most of these deaths are expected to
occur in  Asia,  where  the ground-level  ozone  concentrations  as  well as the  size of  the
exposed population are likely to be highest. More than 40% of the world’s ozone-linked
premature deaths in 2050 are expected to occur in China and India. However, once adjusted
for the size of the population, ozone-related deaths in OECD countries from 2010 to 2050
are projected to be one of the highest, only after India (Figure 6.6, Panel B).

Air pollution: The state of policy today

There  is  a  range  of  policy  approaches  to  limit  outdoor  air  pollution.3  Selected
examples  of  different  policy  approaches  to  address  air  pollution  are  summarised  in
Table 6.3.  In  many  countries,  so-called  “command-and-control”  approaches  using
regulatory standards are complemented by various economic instruments such as taxes
and  tradable  permit  schemes.  Voluntary  programmes  aimed  at  replacing  ovens  and
heaters and retiring old vehicles that are highly polluting have also been introduced in
recent years in several countries. Each of these types of approach is discussed below in
more detail.

In most OECD countries, air pollution policy interventions have become increasingly
integrated over the last 10-15 years, helping to increase cost efficiency. Examples include
the US Clean Air Act, the Canada-US Air Quality Agreement, Clean Air for Europe, and the
National Environment Protection Measure for Ambient Air Quality (Australia), all of which
have set standards for air quality, focusing on target-setting for a range of air pollutants
from stationary sources. These overall frameworks include legislative programmes which
target specific sectors, such as power generation, transport, industrial and households. In
non-OECD countries, there are fewer examples of cohesive programmes for controlling air
pollution. Currently, much of the focus is on specific policies for controlling emissions from
transport, both through standards and economic instruments.

– cost-benefit analyses to support policy 

evaluation (with valuation of health 
impacts); 

– public education (e.g. Canada’s Air 

Quality Health Index).

Voluntary car-scrapping schemes.
International conventions (e.g. The 
Convention on Long-range Transboundary 
Air Pollution).
Telework initiatives (e.g. the US Telework 
Enhancement Act of 2010).

Regulatory approaches

Most countries have regulatory standards for ambient air quality to limit health impacts
on  populations.  These  are  often  based  on  WHO  guidelines  (Table 6.2).  Standards  for
particulate matter are generally based on daily and annual averages and, in some cases,
hourly averages. Standards for the more serious PM2.5 are lower (i.e. stricter) than for PM10
and annual standards are lower than daily standards.

Countries also regulate specific point-source air emissions using standards, monitoring
and reporting. An example is the US Clean Air Act. The European Environment Agency
notes that industrial combustion (comprising emissions from power plants, refineries and
the  manufacturing  sector)  is  a  key  contributor to emissions  of  particulate  matter  and
acidifying pollutants in Europe (EEA, 2010). Among the most important instruments that
have been put in place in the European Union are the Large Combustion Plant Directive

(EC, 2001) and the Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control Directive (EC, 1996), which,
among  other  things,  require  the  use  of  the “best  available  technologies” for pollution
abatement.

Emissions  from  motor  vehicles  are  also  regulated  by  standards  in  most  countries.
Figure 6.7 shows trends in emission standards for hydrocarbons (HC)4 and nitrogen oxides
(NOx)  from petrol-driven passenger cars in the United States, Japan  and the European
Union,  respectively,  between 1970  and 2010.  It  is  evident  that  much  stricter  emission
standards have been established over time in these regions. And while for many years the
standards for these pollutants were more lenient in the European Union than in Japan and
the United States, they are now of similar stringency. Similar trends can be observed for
emissions standards for diesel-driven passenger vehicles in these countries.

Economic instruments

Emission cap-and-trade  programmes (see Chapter 3)  can give  greater flexibility to
industrial plants to decide how to reduce their emissions. For example, the 1990 Clean Air
Act  Amendments  in the United States not  only tightened regulations  for  a number of
emission  sources, they  also introduced  a  cap-and-trade programme for  SO2 emissions
from coal-fired power plants. This allowed a great proportion of the emission reductions to
be achieved by cheaper means (such as switching to low-sulphur coal) than with scrubbers,
which plants had previously been required to install (Burtraw et al., 2005).

Since 1999, a cap-and-trade system has also been used to reduce NOx emissions in the
northeastern United States, stretching from Maryland to Maine, as well as covering the
District of Columbia and some counties of Virginia. The objective is to address the regional
transport of ozone and help meet the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ground-

level ozone set under the Clean Air Act. A regional NOx trading programme, RECLAIM, is
also in place in Southern California (see Burtraw et al., 2005).

In Korea, a  trading  programme  addressing  both SOx and  NOx emissions  has  been
established  in  order  to  reduce  these  emissions  from  large  point  sources  in  the  Seoul
metropolitan area (OECD, 2010a). In Canada, the Province of Ontario has been operating a
NOx and SO2 trading programme since 2001 to reduce these emissions from the electricity
sector (Ontario, 2001).

A number of OECD countries apply taxes on measured or estimated NOx emissions
from major sources (Figure 6.8). The tax rates vary significantly, with the highest tax rates
being applied in the Nordic countries,5 Estonia and in the state of New South Wales in
Australia. The tax rates that are applied in some of the other jurisdictions are so low that
they are unlikely to have an impact on the level of emissions.

Sufficiently  high  fuel  taxes  can  influence  the  size,  number  and  fuel  efficiency  of
vehicles purchased and affect emissions per kilometre travelled. Moderate levels of taxes
on motor vehicle fuels generally have only a modest impact on the number of vehicles and
how much they are driven. There are large differences  in the motor vehicle fuel taxes
applied in OECD countries (Figure 6.9). 

As  NOx  emissions  from  diesel-driven  vehicles  are  considerably  higher  than  from
petrol-driven vehicles,6 the relative shares of these two engine categories in the vehicle
stock is of great importance for local air quality. The tax preference given to diesel fuel

(compared to petrol) in most countries is one of the factors behind the increase in the share
of diesel-driven cars. 

An important factor behind this favouring of diesel cars is the increasing focus on
taxing vehicle carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions through CO2-related tax rate differentiation.
Diesel cars tend to emit less CO2  per  kilometre than  petrol-driven vehicles due to the
higher  fuel-efficiency  of  the  diesel  engine.  However,  this  advantage  regarding  CO2
emissions is fully “internalised”, i.e. the drivers benefit directly from the savings. From this
point of view, no tax preference for diesel is called for. On the other hand, each litre of diesel
leads  to  larger  CO2  emissions  than  a  litre  of  petrol.  Also,  the  disadvantages  of  diesel
vehicles in terms of their NOx emissions  are  not internalised, as their negative health
impacts are not borne by the driver, but by the general public. Drivers have no economic
incentive to take these into account when choosing what type of vehicle to buy.

The shift towards diesel vehicles stimulated by the focus on CO2 emissions in motor
vehicle taxes could be “corrected”. Israel has recently done this by introducing in their
vehicle purchase tax a graded bonus system that also takes emissions of carbon monoxide
(CO), HC, NOx and PM10 into account.7 This could have significant impacts on the composition
of the car fleet in Israel, especially as the vehicle tax is already relatively high. 

In  considering  policy  options  to  address  motor  vehicle  emissions,  it  should  be
noted  that  emission  standards  (and  one-off  registration  taxes)  only  affect  emissions
from new vehicles, while a very large share of air pollutant emissions stem from old
vehicles.  On  the  other  hand, fuel  taxes  can  affect  emissions  from  older  vehicles,  by
influencing how much they are used. Further, while motor vehicles are becoming more
fuel  efficient,  these  gains  are  being  eroded  as  automobiles  are  being  driven  longer

distances. Policy mixes to address motor vehicle emissions therefore need to also include
options to reduce km travelled via modal shifts (e.g. promoting public transport to reduce
private vehicle use). Behavioural changes in business models and lifestyle (e.g. through car
sharing, the use of teleconferencing, teleworking) should also be encouraged. 

How do the costs of air pollution legislation compare to the benefits?

There have been a number of studies done to quantify the economic value of health
benefits of air pollution legislation – the premature deaths avoided often dominate these
estimates. For example, the US Environmental Protection Agency studied the benefits and
costs of all the abatement policies under the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA). The
study estimated that by 2020, total life years gained will be 1.9 million and that the benefits
of the CAAA outweigh the costs by a ratio of 28 to 1 (US EPA, 2010). 

A  UK  study  by  the  Inter-departmental  Group  on  Costs  and  Benefits  found  that  a
number of policy measures for controlling emissions from transport had positive benefit
values (DEFRA, 2007). According to this analysis, measures for phasing out older vehicles
were less preferable as policy options. On the other hand, the net benefits of measures to
reduce PM emissions were consistently positive across all policy variants. However, the net
benefits of measures to reduce ozone emissions were negative in many, if not most, policy
variants. 

The  European  Environment  Agency  (EEA, 2010)  found  that  significant  emission
reductions  have  been  achieved  following  the  introduction  in  the  early 1990s  of  the
European  vehicle  emission  standards  (known  as  the  “Euro  standards”)  in  the  road
transport sector, especially for CO and non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC).
By 2005, emissions of CO were 80% below those projected in  a no-policy scenario, and
NMVOC  emissions  were  68%  lower.  Emissions  of  NOx  were  40%  below  the  no-policy
scenario, and PM2.5 emissions were 60% lower, with the decrease commencing in the mid-
1990s. However, Carslaw et al. (2011) indicate that the EEA estimates for NOx emissions
from motor vehicles could be rather optimistic.

EEA also noted that industrial NOx emissions decreased from 1990 to 2005 following
the EU directives on integrated pollution prevention and control and large combustion
plants. However, they have since remained more or less constant. SO2 emissions were
reduced more significantly. The reduction in PM emissions from industrial combustion
was estimated to have been more significant than that of the road transport sector, and
greatest in major industrialised areas such as Germany, Italy’s Po Valley, the Netherlands
and Poland. The health benefits of this decrease in PM2.5 emissions would equate to a
reduction of about 60% in Years of Life Lost (YLL) compared to a no-policy scenario.

Need for further action
Making the most of policy synergies

Policies  that  address  several  goals  (environmental,  social  or  economic)  can  help
maximise  benefits  effectively.  Such  opportunities  exist  for  tackling  climate  change
mitigation and improving human health, as some of the damaging air pollutants are also
greenhouse gases (GHGs) (Box 6.3). GHG emission reductions affect climate change in the
long run, whereas the benefits of reducing local air pollution are likely to be felt more
quickly.  This  works  the  other  way  around  as  well,  in  that  targets  to  reduce  local  air
pollution are likely to have positive long-term impacts on climate change.

Box 6.3. Air pollutants and global warming gases

Air pollution and climate change are closely linked environmental problems. Energy use
and transportation are important causes of both, and measures to combat climate change
are likely to have considerable ancillary benefits in reducing air pollution and its adverse
effects on health and ecosystems.

Common pollutants play a role in climate change and air pollution. Ground-level ozone
is a significant GHG. The reduction of the ozone precursor gases methane (CH4) and carbon
monoxide (CO) – which are both direct and indirect GHGs (via formation of CO2) – would
reduce ozone concentrations and climate change. Methane is considered a “short-lived
climate  forcer”  similar  to  black  carbon,  because  it  remains  in  the  atmosphere  for
approximately 12 years, much shorter than longer-lived carbon dioxide. Methane is also
the  second  largest  contributor  to  human-induced  warming  after  carbon  dioxide
(Forster et al., 2007).

Black  carbon  particles  absorb  solar  radiation,  and  can  contribute  to  atmospheric
warming by reflecting infrared light. This effect continues after deposition of the black
carbon particles on snow or ice surfaces, as darkening of the snow and ice will absorb more
sunlight, leading to further melting (see Chapter 3). 

The particles formed from SO2 and NOx may also influence the climate, directly through
reflection or absorption of sunlight and indirectly through acting as condensation nuclei
for  cloud  formation.  In  general,  this  type  of  aerosol  has  a  net  cooling  effect  on  the
atmosphere.

For example, regulating methane, a highly potent GHG and also a precursor for ozone
formation, could offer double dividends for both human health and climate change. As the
concentrations of ground-level ozone vary from region to region, abatement policies would
have global climate benefits as well as different regional benefits, not only in terms of
reducing asthma and mortality rates, but also increased crop yields (see Chapter 3, on
climate change). 

There  are  many  examples  of  methane  reduction  policies.  Methane  reduction
measures include changing agricultural practices, sealing leaks from natural gas pipelines
and storage facilities, and capturing methane from landfill sites. Such policies are often
cost-saving and in some cases profitable because methane has a commodity value as the
main component of natural gas (US EPA, 2006). Methane is listed as a Kyoto Protocol gas
and  is  therefore  part  of  the  Clean Development  Mechanism  (CDM)  under  the Protocol
(see Chapter 3). Many  CDM  projects  have  proven  that  methane  reduction  can  be  cost-
effective  and  a  source  of  revenue  for  developing  countries  and  project  developers
(Clapp et al., 2010).

However, while there are several possibilities for creating “win-win” policy options to
tackle both climate change and health impacts of air pollution, in some areas there are also
possible trade-offs (Box 6.4).

The case of indoor air pollution

In 2000, about 2.9 billion people relied on traditional fuels (such as firewood and cow dung) for cooking,
mainly  in  Asia  and  Sub-Saharan  Africa  (IEA, 2010).  The  OECD  Environmental  Outlook  Baseline  scenario
suggests  that  the  use  of solid fuels  in  Sub-Saharan  Africa will continue to rise until 2030  (Figure 6.10,
Panel A). However, the emerging economies of Brazil, India, Indonesia, China and South Africa began to

Note: There are uncertainties associated with the methodology used to model the impacts of exposure to indoor air pollution,
particularly with regard to translating domestic energy use to levels of exposure from solid fuel use. The underlying data sources (from
the WHO and the International Energy Agency – IEA) use different definitions. For example, the WHO uses main source of energy while
the IEA uses total solid fuel use. Further, while exposure levels can be influenced to a significant degree by the use of improved stoves
and/or basic ventilation, such as opening a window while cooking, these factors have not been considered due to lack of data.

The case of indoor air pollution (cont.)

reduce their reliance on traditional solid fuels for cooking and heating in the 1990s, and this downward
trend is likely to continue over the next 40 years. The Baseline scenario projects that globally the number
of deaths caused by solid fuel use will gradually decline in the coming decades (Figure 6.10, Panel B). This
will be due to higher incomes (and hence a greater ability to purchase cleaner fuels) and better health
services. While the number of deaths due to respiratory infections is expected to decrease in South Asia
and Sub-Saharan Africa, the number of deaths related to COPD is expected to increase in Southeast and
South Asia, mainly due to ageing of the population.

It is possible that climate mitigation policies could result in higher global prices of fossil-fuel based
energy sources such as kerosene and liquefied petroleum gas. If this happens, poorer households could
find  that  these  cleaner-burning  fuels  become  too  expensive,  making  the  move  away  from  traditional
energy sources more difficult. In that event, the projected number of premature deaths might increase.
As an illustration, the impacts on premature death linked to indoor air pollution were assessed for the
policy simulation for climate stabilisation via a global carbon tax applied to all energy users including
households (see Chapter 3 on climate change). This stylised simulation suggests that increased energy
costs would lead to an additional 300 million people lacking access to modern energy sources in 2050.
This  would  in  turn  imply  300 000 more  premature  deaths  by 2050  than  under  the  Baseline  scenario
projections.  To  prevent  this  incompatible  outcome,  targeted  policies  would  be  needed  to  provide
alternative  clean  energy  for  poor  households.  These  might  include  public-private  partnerships  to
facilitate the use of new model stoves which burn hotter and more efficiently (e.g. the Global Alliance for
Clean Cookstoves) and education policies aimed at ensuring proper ventilation indoors. 

Other sources of indoor air pollution more relevant to OECD countries include dampness and mould
growth, combustion by-products released from heating or cooking appliances, and releases of chemicals
from products. Climate change also has the potential to affect indoor air due to the alterations made in
buildings  to  protect  against  outdoor  conditions  (e.g. tightly-sealed  buildings)  which  may  increase
exposure of inhabitants to indoor pollutants. 

Getting the policy mix right

In  addition  to  the  direct  health  benefits  of  reducing  air  pollution,  there  are  also
economic benefits, such as increased productivity for those affected and their caregivers,
reduced expenditures for medicines and medical services, and reduced expenditures on
averting  behaviour  (e.g. avoiding  polluted  areas,  purchasing  filtration  devices).  As  a
consequence, “pricing” these pollutants will not only yield health benefits, but may also
have  positive  economic  consequences.  Market-based  instruments,  such  as  taxes  and
tradable permits, are the most direct mean of pricing pollution. The great advantage of
market-based instruments compared to most other policies is that they operate on all
levels,  inducing  invention,  diffusion  and  adoption  of  environmental  technologies
(see OECD, 2010a).

One  difficulty  with  tackling air pollution is  that many  of  the main  source sectors
(electricity  supply  and  transport)  possess  features  which  necessitate  broader  policy
reforms  (OECD, 2011b).  The  long-lived  nature  of  the  physical  infrastructure,  the
interdependence of  different elements  of service delivery,  and the  complex regulatory
background mean that shifting onto a greener trajectory may take some time and come at
relatively greater cost if the burden rests entirely on the pricing of pollution, rather than a

296

OECD ENVIRONMENTAL OUTLOOK TO 2050 © OECD 2012

6. HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENT

broader  mix  of  policy incentives. For  instance, targeted support for  R&D in  mitigation
technologies  can  be  an  effective  complementary  policy.  While  very  unlikely  to  be
economically efficient when used alone, such support can reduce mitigation costs when
used in conjunction with policies which price pollution directly (Popp, 2006; OECD, 2009b).
Co-ordination among a number of policy spheres is required, as well as a forward-looking
policy  regime which does  not favour  those market  incumbents  at the  expense of new
entrants.

Encouraging innovation in pollution abatement technologies is key to bringing about
this transition. A flexible policy regime will encourage innovators to devote resources to
identifying least-cost solutions, and give firms and households the option to adopt the
most  appropriate  technologies  for  their  situation.  In  addition,  a  predictable  policy
framework will reduce some  of the uncertainty associated  with  undertaking the risky
investments required to develop innovative solutions (OECD, 2011b; Johnstone et al., 2010).
Organisational and behavioural innovations also have an important role to play.

What if… air pollution emissions were reduced by up to 25%?

A policy simulation was run of a hypothetical air pollution abatement approach which
would reduce emissions of NOx, SO2 and black carbon by up to 25%. This 25% Air Pollution
Reduction scenario estimates the number of avoided premature deaths compared to the
Baseline  of  no  new  policies  up  to  the  year 2050  (for  more  details  of  the  analysis  see
Annex 6.A).8

This scenario suggests that about half of the total emission reductions are projected to
come  from  end-of-pipe  measures,  such  as  scrubbers  on  smokestacks  and  catalytic
converters on automobile tailpipes (Table 6.4). This is somewhat higher in the BRIICS and
in the rest of the world (RoW) as many of the OECD countries have already implemented
end-of-pipe measures and are focusing on other approaches (e.g. energy efficiency). This
distinction is important as structural measures tend to have more co-benefits for climate
change related emissions, resulting in 5% less global emissions of CO2 compared to the
Baseline in 2030 and 2050.

The health benefits, in terms of avoided deaths, are projected to be greatest in the
BRIICS in both 2030 and 2050 compared to the Baseline. These health gains could be even
greater if additional policies in other sectors were included in the analysis (e.g. those that
address forest burning and transport). However, despite relatively significant reductions in
emissions projected under this simulation, the number of avoided deaths when compared
to the Baseline would be relatively modest. This may be due to the fact that in some cities,
especially in Asia, concentration levels projected in the Baseline are far above the maximum
threshold level and thus huge reduction efforts would be needed before positive health
impacts are seen. In addition, greater urbanisation expected during the next 40 years, and
the large increase in the number of elderly people (the most susceptible group) is likely to
lead to more premature deaths, all else being equal. Overall, this suggests that even greater
reductions would be needed to have any significant impact on the growing number of
premature deaths.

A rough approximation of the benefit/cost for each region (see Annex 6.A) suggests
that the benefit/cost ratio would be highest in the BRIICS, followed by OECD countries and
the rest of the world, and that the benefits would be higher in 2050 than in 2030. However,

it is important to note the benefit values are highly dependent on the value of statistical life
(VSL) used in the estimation9 and that they do not account for reduction in morbidity (for
more details, see Annex 6.A).

3. Unsafe water supply and poor sanitation

Impacts on human health

In 2004,  unsafe  water  supply  and  poor  sanitation  and  the  associated  exposure  to
pathogenic micro-organisms were responsible for around 1.6 million deaths and 6.3% of
worldwide disability adjusted life-years (DALYs), mainly due to diarrhoea (WHO, 2009a).
Children are most affected, with 20% of DALYs in children under 14, and 30% of deaths of
children  under 5  (Prüss-Üstün et al.,  2008).  Approximately  88%  of  diarrhoeal  deaths
globally are caused by unsafe water, poor sanitation and hygiene, and 99% of these are in
developing countries (WHO, 2009a). In addition to the personal tragedy involved, these
losses  exert  a  significant  financial  cost  on  developing  countries.  In  Africa  alone,  the
economic  loss  due  to  the  lack  of  access  to  safe  drinking  water  (i.e. water  for  human
consumption) and sanitation is about 5% of GDP per year (UN WWAP, 2009). This section
discusses the health impact of unsafe water and poor sanitation. Data in this section also
appear in Chapter 5 of this Outlook, where the focus is more on access to an improved water
source and basic sanitation. 

Key trends and projections in water supply and sanitation
Current data and past trends 

Water  supply  and  sanitation  can  be  categorised  into  three  levels  of  service:  no
coverage; “improved” services (such as public standpipes or boreholes); and household
connections. Each has a particular risk potential for incidence of diarrhoea (Cairncross and
Valdmanis, 2006). These levels of risk depend on the level of urbanisation, income and
population  density. It is  also  important to emphasise  the safety of the  water provided
(Box 6.5) – improved services through household connections may not necessarily provide

298

6. HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENT

Box 6.5. A word about the OECD Environmental Outlook water analysis

The OECD Environmental Outlook Baseline projections of connection rates for water supply
and sanitation are based on a regression model using country data from the WHO/UNICEF
Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP; see the Annex to Chapter 5). The health impacts are
based on relative risks as reported in the literature, taking into account greater risks due to
increasing atmospheric temperature as well as the size of the child population which is
underweight, while less risk due to possible interventions such as use of oral rehydration
therapy.

The category “improved” water supply and sanitation encompasses a broad range of
possible types of connection for which each is assumed to lead to the same health risk
potential. The analysis considers only two classes of urbanisation – urban and rural. This
may  not reflect all situations within urban  areas (which  can  include  slums and more
affluent areas). While increasing water and sanitation connections may be easier in urban
areas, it is not always the case that greater urbanisation will result in greater connections
and may instead lead to increased health risks, as in less favourable urban conditions.
Overall, empirical data on the combination of water supply and sanitation categories are
lacking,  though  the  health  risks  are  specifically  related  to  combinations  of  the  two.
Therefore, the assumption is that there is no dependency between the two, which may
affect the estimation of health risks. 

It  is  also  important to  note that  data  on  access  to  water and sanitation  services  as
monitored by the JMP do not measure access to safe water. The JMP measures access to
specific water supply and sanitation technologies, rather than the actual quality of service
to  which  people  have  access.  The  projections  which  have  been  made  in  this  OECD
Environmental  Outlook are based on the JMP data and therefore also overestimate these
coverage  rates.  The  number  of  people  without  access  to  safe  water  is  uncertain,  but
exceeds the number of people without access to an improved water source by one order of
magnitude.

safer water. Today, almost 900 million people lack access to improved water supplies and
2.6 billion people do not have access to basic sanitation (see Chapter 5). Over 80% of the
sewage in developing countries is discharged untreated into water bodies (UN WWAP, 2009).
Around 70% of all people without improved sanitation live in Asia (WHO/UNICEF, 2010). Of the
world’s regions, Sub-Saharan Africa has been moving the most slowly towards improved
sanitation: only 31% of residents had access to improved sanitation in 2006.

The share of OECD populations connected to public wastewater treatment plants rose
from 50% in the early 1980s to almost 70% in 2010 (see Chapter 5). However, the situation
varies across countries, especially in terms of the sophistication of wastewater treatment:
some countries have installed secondary and tertiary treatment10 while others are still
completing sewerage networks or the installation of first generation treatment plants.
Several  countries  have  found  alternative environmentally  effective  and  economically
efficient ways of treating wastewater from small, isolated settlements. 

Future projections

The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) set targets for human development. One
such target is to “halve, by 2015, the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe
drinking-water and basic sanitation” (Target 7.C). 

OECD ENVIRONMENTAL OUTLOOK TO 2050 © OECD 2012

299

6. HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENT

The OECD Environmental Outlook Baseline projects that if current trends continue, the world
as a whole might meet the MDG drinking water target by 2015, though this will mainly be
because of rapid progress in large emerging economies such as China and India. Other regions,
such as Sub-Saharan Africa, are unlikely to meet the water supply target. The number of city
dwellers without access to an improved water source has actually increased between 1990
and 2008, as urbanisation outpaces progress in access. Access to improved water supply is
expected to be universal in OECD and BRIICS countries before 2050 under the Baseline.

Progress is slower for sanitation – the OECD Environmental Outlook Baseline projects that on
current trends, the MDG sanitation target will not be met. It projects that by 2030 more than
2 billion people will still lack basic sanitation facilities, and this figure would only drop to
1.4 billion by 2050. In 2030, the majority of those who lack basic sanitation would live outside
the OECD and BRIICS countries (i.e. mainly in developing countries), and this proportion will
continue to grow over the following two decades. As can be seen in Figures 5.12 and 5.13 in
Chapter 5, today the vast majority of those without access to an improved water supply and
basic sanitation live in rural areas. This is projected to continue to 2050, when the number of
people in rural areas who lack access to sanitation would drop significantly to become
comparable with that in urban areas. 

With greater access to improved water supply and basic sanitation facilities, the Baseline
projects that the coming decades will see a reduction in child mortality from diarrhoea
(Figure 6.11). This assumes that increasing urbanisation will in general (see Box 6.5) make it

easier and cheaper to connect residents to water supplies and sanitation facilities; that
greater economic growth will increase the basic standard of living (including access to
medical treatment); and that the number of people most susceptible to unsafe water and
sanitation (i.e. children under the age of five) will decrease due to the continuing ageing of
the  population  in  most  countries,  including  developing  countries.  Despite  these
assumptions, it is important to note that greater urbanisation can in some cases magnify
water challenges – such as the management of waste and water in slums – with serious
consequences for human health. 

It is assumed that in the future, improvements in access to drinking water supplies
will  be implemented ahead  of  improvements  in sanitation,  as water supply levels are
higher today than sanitation levels for almost all countries. Average water supply and
sanitation coverage levels are expected to improve continually over the next two decades
and, as a result, childhood deaths due to diarrhoea should also decline.

Need for further action
Investing in water supply and sanitation

Access to clean drinking water and sanitation provides economic, environmental and
social  benefits.  Benefit-to-cost  ratios  have  been  reported  to  be  as  high  as  7 to 1 in
developing countries (WHO figure, cited in OECD, 2011c). Three-quarters of these benefits
stem from time gains, i.e. less time spent having to walk long distances to collect water or
to queue at the water source. To a large degree the other benefits are linked to a reduction
of water-borne diseases such as reduced incidence of diarrhoea, malaria or dengue fever.
An empirical study by Whittington et al. (2009) estimates that the avoided cost of illness
would amount to USD 1 per month per household, which is much less than the costs of
improved water  and sanitation services, estimated at  approximately  USD 4 per month
(Pattanayak et al.,  2005).  Other  non-health  benefits  must  therefore  be  taken  into
consideration when adding up the full benefits stemming from improved access to water
and  sanitation.  The  benefits  mean  more  time  available  for  education  and  a  more
productive labour force. 

Health experts have debated whether it is water quantity or quality that matters most
in terms of driving health benefits. Cairncross and Valdmanis (2006) estimate that most of
the benefits from water supply are attributable to improved convenience of access to water
in terms of quantity. Other experts argue that water quality is a critical determinant driving
health benefits. Waddington et al. (2009) points out that while water supply interventions
appear ineffective – with a negligible or insignificant impact on diarrhoea morbidity on
average – water quality interventions can reduce the incidence of diarrhoea in children by
about 40%. Prüss et al. (2002) state that point-of-use treatment solutions (e.g. boiling) can
significantly improve the impact of water supply interventions, with an estimated 45%
reduction in diarrhoea rates. Such analysts argue that treatment at point of use is more
efficient than treatment at the point of source. 

In  most  OECD  countries,  large  benefits  were  reaped  in  the  late  19th  or  early  20th
centuries when basic water and sanitation infrastructure was extended to much larger
parts of the population. For instance, the introduction of water chlorination and filtration
in 13 major US cities during the early 20th century led to significant reductions in mortality,
with  a  calculated  ratio  of  benefits  to  costs  to  society  of  23 to 1 and  a  saving  of  about

USD 500 per person in 2003 (OECD, 2011c). OECD experience shows, however, that the rate of
return of water and sanitation interventions diminishes with the increasing sophistication of
measures.

The benefits from wastewater treatment are not obvious to the public and are more
difficult to assess in monetary terms. However, anecdotal evidence can be derived from
case studies. For instance, the health benefits of quality improvements of recreational
waters  in  south-west  Scotland  have  been  calculated  at  GBP 1.3 million  per  year
(Hanley et al., 2003). 

Uncertainty related to the economic valuation of health impacts of unsafe water and
poor sanitation remains an issue. Data are scarce, and where they do exist, for instance on
health  benefits,  experts  question  the  reliability  of  the  information.  Further,  health
concerns vary depending on the type of infrastructure developed and how the water will be
used (Box 6.6). Better information is  needed to build  a strong  political  case  for action.
Finally, the benefits of additional investments in water services vary among countries, so
local assessments are needed. 

Box 6.6. Overcoming health concerns surrounding water 

reuse and recycling

Reused water (either reclaimed water or grey water*) is increasingly seen as a sustainable
source  for  some  uses  of  water,  essentially  for  irrigation,  groundwater  recharge,  and
possibly  for  non-potable  domestic  uses.  It  is  regarded  as  one  option  to  address  the
increasing mismatch between rising demand and available water resources in both OECD
and  developing  countries.  Reused  water  can  be  supplied  from  either  centralised  or
decentralised distributed systems.

Markets for water reuse are booming. In addition, emerging economies and rural areas
are  gaining  experience  with  distributed  water  infrastructure  for  water  supply  and
sanitation services, but this is less the case in urban areas in OECD countries. Australia,
Israel, Spain and some states in the United States are pioneering these new technologies,
spurred by serious constraints to water resources.

However,  health-related  issues  are  a  major  constraint  in  the  development  of  such
systems.  First,  these  systems  can  generate  public  health  risks  (e.g.  possible  water
contamination during domestic use, or salinisation of irrigated soils). Second, the payback
period of the additional investment costs required by such systems (due to additional
equipment, or in-house dual plumbing, for instance) depends on the standards set by the
regulatory  agencies  (environment  and/or  health  authorities)  for  reused  water.  These
standards govern what water can be harvested, quality standards of  reused water for
specific applications, building standards, agricultural standards, etc. The National Water
Quality Management Strategy in Australia, for example, addresses such risks by including
quality guidelines and monitoring for the safe use of recycled water, and includes an easy-
to-use Decision Support Tool to help users to create a draft management plan for their
water recycling scheme.

What if… there was universal access to improved water supply and basic sanitation 
in 2050? 

Chapter 5 has already presented the Accelerated Access scenario, a hypothetical policy
simulation  to  estimate  the  expected  additional  annual  costs  and  health  benefits  of
achieving  universal  access  to  improved  water  supply  and  basic  sanitation  by 2050.  In
comparison  with  the  Baseline  of  no  new  policies,  this  simulation  includes:  i) halving,
by 2030, the population without access to an improved water source and basic sanitation
from a 2005 base year; and then ii) moving to universal access in 2050. This scenario does
not  assume  access  to  safe  water.  This  chapter  outlines  the  health  impacts  of  these
additional connections to improved water supply and basic sanitation facilities.

This simulation projects that compared to the Baseline, by 2030 almost 100 million
additional people would have access to an improved source of water and around 472 million
more would have access to basic sanitation facilities. Almost all of the additional people with
access to an improved water source would be living outside the OECD and BRIICS countries
(Table 6.5). By 2050, universal access would mean that 242 million more people than in the
Baseline scenario would have access to an improved water source, with the RoW accounting for
most of this gain. An additional 1.36 billion people would have access to sanitation facilities
(795 million in the RoW, and 562 million in the BRIICS). In terms of health impacts, over the
next 40 years, the highest number of avoided deaths under this policy would be in the RoW
group of countries. Morbidity levels would also be expected to improve, although only
mortality results were obtained from this particular simulation. It is important to note that
while access to improved water sources will increase significantly, there will not be a
commensurate  reduction in  mortality,  as access  to improved  water  sources  does  not
necessarily mean access to “safe” water. 

The policy  simulation  indicates  that  an  additional  USD 1.9 billion  globally  would
need to be invested each year between 2010 and 2030 (beyond that invested under the
Baseline)  to  achieve  the 2030 target;  and  an  additional  USD 7.6 billion would  be  needed
annually between 2031 and 2050 to achieve the 2050 target.11

4. Chemicals

The chemicals industry is one of the world’s largest industrial sectors – it makes a
significant contribution to the global economy and to the living standards and health of
people throughout the world. However, the production and use of chemicals can also have
a negative impact on human health and the environment.

This section examines the current and projected negative impacts of chemicals on
human  health, and government and industry approaches to addressing these impacts.
Although the focus is on health impacts, this does not imply that there are no environmental
effects of concern from chemicals but their assessment is beyond the scope of this current
Outlook.  Substances  of  particular  ecotoxicological  concern  such  as  persistent,
bioaccumulative,  toxic  (PBT)  substances;  very  persistent  very  bioaccumulative  (vPvB)
substances; or persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are discussed in this section, but only in
the context of their impacts on human health (due to their persistence, accumulation and
widespread exposure potential). 

Impacts on human health

The chemicals industry is very diverse, comprising basic or commodity chemicals
(e.g. inorganic chemicals, petrochemicals, petrochemical derivatives); speciality chemicals
derived from basic chemicals (e.g. adhesives and sealants, catalysts, coatings, electronic
chemicals, plastic additives); products derived from life sciences (e.g. pharmaceuticals,
pesticides and products of modern biotechnology); and consumer care products (e.g. soap,
detergents, bleaches, hair and skin care products, and fragrances).

Products developed by the chemicals industry can improve people’s health and well-
being. Pharmaceuticals have played a major role in increasing life expectancy, agrochemicals
can improve crop yields and new modified crops can resist drought and salinity, allowing
farmers  to  better  adapt  to  changes  in  climatic  conditions.  Some  products  help  in
preventing water borne and vector borne diseases, and others, such as insulation material
and low-temperature detergents, can improve energy efficiency.

While not all chemicals are hazardous, exposure to some chemicals can cause serious
human health and/or environmental effects. Of particular concern for human health from
environmental  exposure  are  persistent  and  bio-accumulative  substances,  endocrine-
disrupting chemicals (Box 6.8) and heavy metals (EEA, 2011).

Human  health  effects  from  exposure  to  chemicals  depend  on  the  inherent  toxic
properties  of chemicals; the level, frequency and duration of exposure; and individual
susceptibility. Table 6.6 summarises the health effects associated with some chemicals.
This table also lists sensitive population groups who can be particularly vulnerable due to
physiological factors (EEA, 1999). Early human life stages, especially the embryonic, foetal
and infant stages, are known to be particularly sensitive to chemicals – toxic exposure at
these stages can lead to disease and disability throughout a lifespan, including reproductive
effects (Gee, 2008; Grandjean et al., 2007).

Although the specific health impacts of chemicals are complex and sometimes open
to debate, some deleterious effects are well documented, such as cancer from exposure to
asbestos and leukaemia from exposure to benzene. Others, such as adverse reproductive
effects from exposure to  endocrine disrupting substances, are currently  the subject  of
extensive research (Box 6.8).

Based on data gathered in 2004, the WHO has estimated the global disease burden
attributable to i) chemicals in acute poisoning episodes (including drugs but excluding self
inflicted injuries); ii) selected chemicals in occupational exposures; and iii) lead. In total it
estimates these three categories caused around one million deaths globally in 2004, and
21 million disability adjusted life years (DALYs). This represents 1.7% of total deaths and 1.4%
total DALYs worldwide (Prüss-Ustün et al., 2011). While this section focuses mainly on human
exposure to chemicals in the environment, it is important to note that the portion of the
disease  burden  attributed  to  occupational  exposure  is  significant:  581 000 deaths  and
6 763 000 DALYs in 2004.

However, the real burden of disease associated with chemicals is likely to be higher than
the figures presented above. This is because, at a minimum, the WHO estimate does not
include most chronic consumer exposure to chemicals, or chronic exposure to pesticides and
heavy metals such as cadmium and mercury, for which incomplete data are available. 

For all three categories of chemicals studied by the WHO, the global burden of disease
falls more heavily on non-OECD countries. The United Nations Environment Programme
(UNEP) also found a link between poverty and increased risks of exposure to hazardous
chemicals and waste. People in developing countries are primarily affected by hazardous
chemicals because of their occupation, living situation and lack of knowledge about the
detrimental impacts of exposure to these chemicals and wastes (UNEP, 2009).

Exposure

Given the ubiquitous nature of chemicals, humans can be exposed through many daily
activities  and  multiple  routes.  Exposure  can  occur  from  consuming  water  or  food
contaminated with chemicals from agricultural and industrial processes (e.g. pesticides,
heavy metals, dioxins); from ingestion, inhalation or skin contact with chemicals emitted
from construction materials or indoor products, or chemicals contained in toys, jewellery,
textiles,  food  containers,  or  consumer  products  (e.g. heavy  metals,  phthalates,
formaldehyde, dyes, fungicides or pesticides); and from foetal exposure during pregnancy.
Ingestion  of  paints  (particularly  by  children),  and  ingestion  or  inhalation  of  soil
contaminated by industrial and agricultural processes and household waste (e.g. heavy
metals, pesticides, and persistent organic pollutants) are other possible routes of exposure
(Prüss-Ustün et al., 2011).

6. HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENT

Biomonitoring studies assessing human exposure to chemicals in the environment have
shown that numerous chemicals are found in the human body at various levels (CDC, 2009).
These studies have contributed to a growing recognition that risk assessments need to
i) consider potential exposure throughout the whole life cycle of the chemical (Box 6.7); and
ii) account for the potential additive and synergistic effects of human exposure to multiple
chemicals (Box 6.8) (EEA, 2011).

To better characterise chemical exposure and provide the public with data on chemical
releases, most OECD countries and some non-OECD economies have established Pollutant
Release and Transfer Registers (PRTRs)12 that document the quantities of potentially harmful
chemicals reported  by  facilities which are  routinely  released  to  air,  water,  soil  and/or
transferred off-site. PRTRs are an important tool for providing the public with environmental
data and promoting improvements in the management of chemical substances. In Japan, for
example, the total amount of chemicals released or transferred from facilities was reduced
by one-third between 2001 and 2009 as a result of voluntary actions taken by business
operators, regulations set by local authorities or agreements between local authorities and
industries based on numerical targets using PRTR data. While a considerable amount of PRTR
data on environmental releases are available, data gaps still remain: PRTRs may not be
comprehensive (e.g. they may only cover a limited number of chemicals) and they have some
limitations (e.g. small facilities may not be required to report, and very few PRTRs provide
data on diffuse sources of releases) (EEA, 2011). 

In addition to PRTRs, governments and industry apply calculations and methodologies
described in Emission Scenario Documents (ESDs) to estimate the releases of chemicals
following  their  production  and  use,  as  well  as  the  concentration  of  chemicals  in  the
environment. Governments, working through the OECD, have developed a number of ESDs
which can be applied to industrial sectors and chemical uses.13

Industrial  installations  are  not  the  only  source  of  chemical  releases  to  the
environment; chemicals can also be emitted from agricultural processes (e.g. spraying of
pesticides) and from products during use (Box 6.7); or from waste, although data on such
releases  are  limited.  Gathering  accurate  data  is  further  complicated  by  the  fact  that
chemicals in products and waste are shipped around the globe, and thus difficult to track.
Chemical  waste  is  of  particular  concern  in  non-OECD  countries,  where  inadequate
monitoring capacities and institutional mechanisms to manage it may lead to serious air,
water and soil pollution (UNEP, 2007). 

Box 6.7. Assessing chemical releases: The example of phthalates

Quantifying releases of chemicals from products and assessing related health effects are
difficult and such data are not often included in chemical risk assessments. One exception
is phthalates used in  plastics – a  subject  of  recent studies  due  to concerns  over  their
possible endocrine-disrupting effects (Box 6.8). Phthalates are mainly used as plasticisers
(substances added to plastics to increase their flexibility, transparency, durability, and
longevity). They are used in products ranging from adhesives and glues, electronics to
packaging,  children’s  toys,  modelling  clay,  waxes,  paints,  printing  inks  and  coatings,
pharmaceuticals, medical devices, food products, and textiles.

6. HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENT

Box 6.7. Assessing chemical releases: The example of phthalates (cont.)
Although PRTRs provide information on releases from production sites, major use sites
and  landfills,  it is unlikely that  all material containing  phthalates will be disposed of
through monitored routes. Ascertaining the difference (or mass balance) between what
went into a plastic and what is present on disposal is difficult, but methods do exist to
estimate their release from plastic (and other materials). These methods are outlined in
the OECD  ESDs.  Substances can  be  released  to the  air through volatilisation  from  the
surface of the material, into water or indirectly into the soil through leaching. How they are
released depends on the properties of the substance and the circumstances in which the
material is used. As an example, plastics used in outdoor materials are exposed to air and
to the water flowing over them and hence releases to both media are possible. Plastic items
used indoors are also exposed to air but are probably less likely to come into contact with
water; an exception would be vinyl flooring, which is washed. There is also the possibility
of loss of the material itself to air and water through abrasion and wear. So, the use pattern
for plastics containing phthalates has a significant impact on the potential for release to
the environment.

As an illustration of the potential importance of these releases, the values below are
taken  from the  risk  assessment for diethylhexyl  phthalate  (DEHP)  carried out  for  the
Existing Substances Regulation in the EU (EC, 2008). The overall release was about one
quarter of the amount of substance produced per year; the rest is assumed to be destroyed
on disposal (through incineration or degradation in landfill) or as part of the emission
control measures at formulation and use. Other phthalates or other plastic additives could
have  a  different  distribution  of  releases depending  on  their  properties  and  their  use
patterns.  While  realistic  estimates  are  now  available  for  exposure  to  phthalates  in
products, much less is known about the many other chemical products on the market.

Assessing chemical hazards

OECD governments have established programmes for collecting data, assessing and
then managing the risks posed by chemicals using both regulatory and non-regulatory
approaches.  The  testing  of  chemicals  can  be  labour  intensive,  time  consuming  and
expensive. Because of the need to relieve some of this burden and to speed up the process,
the OECD Council adopted in 1981 a Decision on the Mutual Acceptance of Data (MAD),
which requires that a safety test carried out in accordance with the OECD Test Guidelines

6. HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENT

and Principles of Good Laboratory Practice in one OECD country must be accepted by other
OECD countries for assessment purposes. MAD increases the efficiency and effectiveness
of chemical notification and registration procedures for both governments and industry,
enabling them to save around EUR 150 million per year by avoiding duplicative testing and
sharing data (OECD, 2010b). Since 1997 an OECD Council Decision has allowed non-OECD
economies  to  also  take  part  in  this  system.  Argentina,  Brazil,  India,  South  Africa  and
Singapore  have  implemented  this  system  via  the  appropriate  legislative  and
administrative procedures and are full adherents to MAD; and Malaysia and Thailand are
provisional adherents.

To date, much of the information needed to determine the hazard of a chemical has
been generated from laboratory tests through in vivo dosing of experimental animals, and
in vitro tests. While this approach has supported regulatory decision making over the past
several decades, new advances in science (e.g. in biology, biotechnology and bioinformatics)
are leading to a greater understanding of how cells and cell systems work. This may lead
to new toxicity testing approaches that rely mainly on understanding cellular response
pathways or “toxicity pathways” at the cellular level (National Research Council, 2007). In
addition, other approaches, such as computer simulations called (quantitative) structure-
activity relationships or (Q)SARs, are more and more used to provide information on the
hazards of chemicals. 

Governments in OECD countries are working together to collect and assess toxicity
and  exposure  data  using  harmonised  formats,  to  share  data  collection  strategies,  to
develop  assessment  methodologies,  and  to  co-ordinate  actions  on  chemicals
internationally.  Governments  are  also  working  through the OECD  to  develop  new  and
innovative alternative methods and computer models for testing and assessment and to
facilitate access to these tools through the Internet.

Nevertheless,  challenges  remain  in  assessing  the  effects  of  chemicals  on  human
health (see Box 6.8) and collecting sufficient data to complete risk assessments on the
thousands of chemicals on the market. As a result, a high priority for the OECD and its
member countries will be to continue to work towards i) developing harmonised new or
updated test methods that can be used for regulatory decision-making and allow industry
and  governments  to  benefit  from  MAD;  and  ii) harmonising  integrated  approaches  to
testing and assessment used by member countries in their regulatory framework. These
could include the use of (Q)SARs, toxicogenomics (the study of the response of a genome to
hazardous chemicals) and high-throughput screening in vitro assays (that can be applied
rapidly to thousands of chemicals). 

To supplement the information generated by chemical testing and predictive models,
in recent years governments have embarked on large-scale epidemiological studies of the
patterns of illness in the population which might be associated with chemical exposure.
Recent work has focused in particular on early life stages, including two large-scale birth
cohort studies launched in Japan and the United States.

Endocrine disrupters

A  recent  priority  area  for  governments  is  to  investigate  chemicals  or  mixtures  of
chemicals which may have endocrine-disrupting properties. These substances “alter the
function(s) of the endocrine system and consequently cause adverse health effects in an
intact organism, or its progeny, or (sub) populations” (Damstra et al., 2002). A number of
observations of health effects have been made in which endocrine disrupters (ED) could
play  a  role,  including:  declining  sperm  counts,  congenital  malformations  in  children,
cancer, retarded sexual development, retarded neurobehavioural development, impaired
immune functions and effects on metabolism. However, certain lifestyle factors are also
known to be important elements of these problems, and the part attributable to ED needs
to  be  better  evaluated.  New  OECD  validated  and  standardised  screens  or  assays  have
been developed to test chemicals for their possible endocrine-disrupting effects. Many
OECD  member  countries  are  actively  involved  in  gathering  information  on  endocrine
disrupters to help support regulatory actions.1

Manufactured nanomaterials

Nanomaterials can be metals, ceramics, polymeric materials, or composite materials.
Their defining characteristic is their very small size – in the range of 1-100 nanometers
(nm)  in  at  least  one  dimension.  Over  the  past  decade,  nanomaterials  have  been  the
subject  of  enormous  interest.  These  materials  have  the  potential  for  wide-ranging
industrial, biomedical, and electronic applications and are likely to offer many economic
benefits. However, unlocking this potential will require a responsible and co-ordinated
approach to ensure that potential safety issues are being addressed at the same time as
the technology is developing. 

Manufactured nanomaterials (MNs) present unique challenges as a class of substances.
Other than their size, they may not have much in common with each other. While some
are nano-scale counterparts of existing chemicals, other substances have novel chemical
structures. As governments contemplate how to define and distinguish MNs under their
respective regulatory and statutory regimes, they have come together globally in the OECD
to address the human health and environmental implications of nanomaterials. The OECD
Programme on the Safety of Manufactured Nanomaterials includes testing commercially
relevant representative nanomaterial categories for 59 human health and environment
relevant end-points (including physical-chemical properties, fate, and effects). This effort,
which requires scientists to modify dozens of tests and involves nearly 20 OECD and non-
OECD  governments  as  well  as  industry,  will  feed  into  ongoing  work  to  develop  more
specific guidance for testing broader sets of materials. As the sheer numbers of different
materials  proliferate,  the  OECD  is  also  fostering  co-operation  to  rapidly  assess  these
substances using alternative methods, such as in vitro approaches; develop techniques to
assess exposure of workers, consumers, the general population and the environment; and
measure the broader positive and negative environmental impacts that could result from
these new technologies. While the future needs in the environment, health and safety area
for  this  rapidly  evolving  field  are  difficult  to  predict,  this  initial  co-operation  should
provide a firm basis for future efforts in addressing the safety of emerging technologies.

Assessment of combined exposure to multiple chemicals or “mixtures”

Chemical  risk  assessments  generally  consider  the  effects  of  single  substances  in
isolation. However, humans are exposed to mixtures of chemicals, which together may
have  additive  or  synergistic  effects  in  the  human  body.  The  current  risk-assessment
approach  (which  assesses  the  effects  of  individual  chemicals  only)  may  therefore
underestimate the risk to human health and to the environment. For example, Acceptable
Daily Intakes are set as estimates of the acceptable amount of certain substances in food
or drinking water. As they are currently derived from individual chemical risk assessments,
they  might  not  provide  sufficient  protection  from  combined  exposures  to  multiple
chemicals or mixtures. There is a growing trend both at the national and international
level towards considering the assessment of combined exposure to multiple chemicals.2
1. This work includes i) screening of EDs, e.g. the US Endocrine Disrupter Screening Program and the Japanese
Further Actions on Endocrine Disrupting Effects of Chemical Substances (EXTEND 2010); ii) research into
the mechanisms of EDs and the effects of mixtures of EDs,  e.g. the work done by the Danish National
Center on Endocrine Disrupters (www.cend.dk/index-filer/Page319.htm); iii) epidemiology studies on specific
health effects associated with exposure to EDs, e.g. Swiss male fertility study, the results of which are
expected by the end of 2012 or the Danish prenatal pesticide exposure study which started in 2011; and
iv) OECD work on the assessment of ED activity (www.oecd.org/env/testguidelines).

2. Meek  et al.  (2011)  describe  a  framework  for  the  risk  assessment  of  combined  exposure  to  multiple
chemicals based on the 2007 World Health Organization/International Programme on Chemical Safety
Workshop  on  Aggregate/Cumulative  Risk  Assessment. The framework is designed to aid risk assessors in
identifying priorities for risk management for a wide range of applications where co-exposures to multiple
chemicals are expected. In 2011 the WHO and OECD also co-hosted an international workshop on risk
assessment of combined exposures to multiple chemicals, which identified areas for further work, such as
the development of exposure models (OECD, 2011f).

Key trends and projections in chemical safety
Current trends

The global chemicals industry has grown significantly over the past 50 years. Annual
global sales of products from the chemicals sector doubled just between 2000 and 2009
(Figure 6.12). Over this same period, the OECD’s share of the global market dropped from
77% to 63%, while the BRIICS increased their share from 13% to 28%. Some of this increase
is due to the lower costs associated with production in the BRIICS, but also the need for
facilities to be closer to growing markets and feedstock sources. In addition, technology
transfer from companies in developed countries to emerging economies (due to, among
other things, joint ventures and mergers and acquisitions) has helped emerging economies
innovate and play a larger role in the global market (Kiriyama, 2010). Chinese companies in
particular  are  active  in  gaining  access  to  advanced  technologies  in  partnership  with
multinationals, alongside in-house research and development (Kiriyama, 2010). 

In addition to this shift in production, there has been a shift in the types of chemicals
produced. Non-OECD countries, especially the BRIICS (which traditionally produced more
low value, high-volume basic chemicals), now also produce high value, specialty and life
science chemicals, including pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. In the past these were
typically produced only in OECD countries. Some companies in China, India and the Middle
East are turning to specialty and fine chemicals for their sources of profit in response to
increasing competitive pressure in the basic industrial chemicals sector (Kiriyama, 2010).
Since specialty and fine chemicals are characterised by continuous product innovation and
differentiation, this means that more new chemicals will be developed in non-member

economies. It is important to note that while high-volume commodity chemicals have
traditionally been the focus of risk assessments at the national and international level
(i.e. OECD), risks are less likely to have been characterised for other chemicals, such as the
lower volume and specialty chemicals. 

Future trends in production

The OECD Environmental Outlook Baseline projects the world chemicals industry to grow
(in terms of sales) by approximately 3% annually to 2050. As shown in recent years, annual
growth  for  the  BRIICS  is  expected  to  continue  to  outpace  that  in  OECD  countries  (4%
compared  to  1.7%),  and  total  production  in  the  BRIICS  will  surpass  OECD  production

by 2050 (Figure 6.13). While total production in the rest of the world will still trail OECD and
BRIICS countries, it will experience the largest growth rate between 2010 and 2050 (4.9%). 

China  is  the  main  contributor  to  BRIICS  chemicals  production  and  currently
represents three-quarters of the production in the BRIICS. However, it is expected that
China’s share of total BRIICS production will drop to two-thirds by 2050.

The significant contribution of chemicals to the global burden of disease, especially in
non-OECD countries, and the predicted continued shift in chemical production over the
next 40 years from OECD to BRIICS countries, will require international co-operation and
capacity  building  for  the  sound  management  of  chemicals  in  non-OECD  countries,
especially through SAICM (Box 6.9). This international effort is needed both for economies
in transition where production of chemicals is increasing, and for developing countries
where chemical use is increasing.

Box 6.9. SAICM: Managing chemicals strategically

The Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management (SAICM) was adopted
by the International Conference on Chemicals Management (ICCM) on 6 February 2006 in
Dubai. It is a policy framework to foster the sound management of chemicals. SAICM was
developed by a multi-stakeholder and multi-sectoral Preparatory Committee. It supports
the  achievement  of  the  goal  agreed  at  the 2002  Johannesburg  World  Summit  on
Sustainable Development of ensuring that, by the year 2020, chemicals are produced and
used in ways that minimise significant adverse impacts on the environment and human
health.  In 2012,  world  leaders  will  assemble  at the Third International Conference on
Chemicals Management (ICCM3) to review progress on SAICM implementation. 

Chemicals: The state of policy today

With the growth of the global chemicals industry, governments are looking for ways to
manage chemicals as efficiently as possible. The management of risks posed by chemicals
can take many forms (Table 6.8). Governments ensure the safety of chemicals through the
assessment and regulation of new and existing chemicals, as well as the use of economic
instruments such as taxes. In addition, governments also ensure chemical safety through
the use of non-regulatory approaches, such as voluntary initiatives aimed at the removal of
harmful  chemical  products  from  the  market,  and  through  the  promotion  of  the
development of  greener  chemicals.  Each  type of  approach  is  described  in  more  detail
below.

Policy evaluations

Cost-benefit analyses of  policy  interventions  may  help risk-management decision
makers by describing the implications of choosing one approach over another. However, to
date, although many studies have estimated the impacts of chemicals policies, few include
estimates of the monetary valuation of the benefits. Recently, the European Chemicals
Agency’s  Socio-Economic  Analysis  Committee  has  begun  preparing  opinions  about
proposals  for  restriction  or  requests  for  authorisation  under  the  new  Registration,
Evaluation,  Authorisation  and  Restriction  of  Chemical  substances  (REACH)  regulation
(see below). These opinions are prepared taking into account the envisaged costs to society
and benefits to human health and the environment. At the global level, the WHO initiative

 Taxes/charges (e.g. leaded petrol).

 Information campaigns (e.g. product 
warnings, awareness-raising campaigns).
Voluntary agreements between industry and 
governments to reduce production and use of 
harmful chemicals (e.g. brominated flame 
retardants).
 International framework for the safe 
management of chemicals (i.e. SAICM).
International conventions on specific 
chemicals (e.g. Stockholm Convention on 
Persistent Organic Pollutants).
 Globally Harmonized System (GHS) of 
Chemical Classification and Labelling.
 Work sharing, through the OECD on 
chemicals prioritised by member countries.
 Internet data access, tools and IT systems.
Reporting for Pollutant Release and Transfer 
Registers.
 Alternatives assessments for priority 
chemicals to inform substitution to safer 
alternatives.
 Green chemistry promotion where safer 
alternatives do not exist.

CHOICE (CHOosing Interventions that are Cost-Effective) has developed a methodology to
provide policy makers with the evidence for deciding on interventions and programmes
which  maximise  health  benefits  within  available  resources  (WHO, 2003).  Greater  co-
operation in the development of this kind of methodologies would both ensure that state-
of-the-art  methods  are  used  in  policy  evaluation  and  allow  more  cross-border  use  of
methodologies and results.

National regulatory frameworks

Recent  years  have  seen  significant  changes  in  national  chemicals  management
programmes,  both  in  OECD  and  non-OECD  countries  (although  enforcement  is  still
incomplete). Many of these new initiatives aim to enhance data collection efforts, extend
regulatory coverage to include chemicals already on the market and increase incentives for
the development of safer and more environmentally friendly chemicals. A few examples
are given below.

European legislation on chemicals changed significantly in 2007 when the EU REACH
Regulation came into force. REACH places the responsibility on industry to provide and
assess  data  and  manage the risks  that  chemicals  may  pose  to  human health  and  the
environment. In addition, a major driver for this regulation was the need to establish a
level  playing  field  for  the  regulation  of  existing  and  new  chemicals.  Previously  in  the
European Union, new chemicals were subject to a significantly stricter regulatory regime
than  those already in use. REACH was designed  to  solve this anomaly by requiring all
chemicals to be assessed (EC, 2007).

In the  United  States,  the  Obama  Administration  announced  Essential  Principles for
Reform  of  Chemicals  Management  Legislation  in  September 2009,  setting  out  the
Administration’s goals for updating the current chemical legislation – the Toxic Substances

Control Act (TSCA). The emphasis is on the review of chemicals against a safety standard
based on sound science and risk-based criteria; submission of sufficient information to
demonstrate  that  chemicals  are  safe;  and  greater  authority  for  the  Environmental
Protection  Agency  (EPA)  to  quickly  and  efficiently  require  testing  or  obtain  other
information and to set priorities for conducting safety reviews. 

The  Canadian  Chemicals  Management  Plan  was  announced  by  the  government
in 2006. This national programme focuses on protecting the health of Canadians and their
environment from the potential risks posed by legacy chemicals that have not previously
been assessed.

Japan amended its Chemical Substances Control Law (Kashinho) in 2009 to introduce
an annual notification of production and import for quantities of above one ton per year for
all chemical substances.14 On receiving the notification, the government chooses chemical
substances  (known  as  Priority  Assessment  Chemical  Substances  or  PACSs)  for further
assessment using available exposure and hazard information. Following the designation of
PACSs, the government of Japan conducts detailed risk assessments. In parallel, since 2005,
there  has  been  an effort  by  industry  to  collect safety  information  on  priority  existing
chemicals under the “Japan Challenge” programme.

In 2010,  China  expanded  its  Measures  on  Environmental  Management  of  New
Chemical Substances which continues the approach of the current law, but expands the
data requirement and risk-management obligations by industry (Freshfields Bruckhaus
Deringer, 2009). 

Economic instruments

The use of taxes on hazardous chemicals can be an effective way of reducing their use,
in some cases. For example, the European Union Nordic countries use taxes as part of their
policy package for regulating pesticides. However, although in many instances economic
incentives such as input taxes work well in isolation, a mix of quantitative regulations and
economic incentives tend to be the best way to control chemical use (Söderholm, 2009).

Another non-regulatory approach is “green procurement” in the public sector. The
government is a significant purchaser of goods and services and therefore its procurement
preferences can act as an incentive to industry to develop more environmentally friendly
products. Also, if there is sufficient government demand this can send a signal to private
purchasers,  giving  the  greener  technology  a  competitive  advantage  and  encouraging
innovation.  For  example,  the  Canadian  Policy  on  Green  Procurement  requires  that
environmental  performance  considerations  be  incorporated  into  federal  procurement
decision-making  processes.  The  US  Environmentally  Preferable  Purchasing  (EPP)
programme helps the federal government “buy green”, using the federal government’s
buying power to stimulate market demand for green products and services. 

Voluntary agreements

Voluntary agreements can be an important complement to market instruments. In
many cases, voluntary agreements are proposed by industries when government is likely
to impose requirements for the control of a chemical. For instance, Responsible Care, an
initiative of the International Council of Chemical Association (ICCA), is a key part of the
global industry’s contribution to SAICM (Box 6.9). Responsible Care has also fostered the
development of the ICCA Global Product Strategy which seeks to improve the industry’s

management of chemicals, including the communication of chemical risks throughout the
supply chain. 

International regulatory framework and international co-ordination

There  are  a  number  of  multinational  and  legally  binding  agreements  to  control

specific chemicals for various purposes. These include the:

■ Basel Convention (transboundary movements of hazardous waste);

■ Montreal Protocol (CFCs and other ozone depleting substances);

■ Rotterdam Convention (export of hazardous chemicals);

■ Stockholm Convention (persistent organic pollutants);

■ United  Nations  Convention  Against  Illicit  Traffic  in  Narcotic  Drugs  and  Psychotropic

Substances (drug control);

■ Chemical Weapons Convention (arms control). 

To strengthen the links and increase synergies between three of these conventions,
the Basel and Stockholm Convention Secretariats and the UNEP part of the Rotterdam
Convention are now led by a Joint Head. 

In  addition,  UNITAR’s  (United  Nations  Institute  for  Training  and  Research)  Global
Capacity Building Programme plays a significant role in the safe management of chemicals
in  non-OECD  countries,  by  providing  institutional,  technical,  and  legal  support  to
governments and stakeholders to develop sustainable capacity for managing dangerous
chemicals and wastes. Project activities take place within the framework of implementing
international  agreements  (e.g. SAICM,  Stockholm  Convention,  Rotterdam  Convention,
United Nations Globally Harmonised System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals).

The OECD is one of the leading international organisations in the field of chemicals
management – its products are used  widely by member and non-member countries.15
Many activities are undertaken (together with UN organisations, via the Inter-Organization
Programme for the Sound Management of Chemicals16) to help non-member countries
establish and improve their chemicals management systems and to introduce them to the
principles  and  tools  used  in  OECD  countries.  In 2008,  the  OECD  Council  adopted  a
Resolution on the Implementation of the SAICM (Box 6.9) that calls for countries to work
together through the OECD to ensure that as chemicals management programmes are
established or upgraded, OECD products will be accessible, relevant and useful to non-
members to help them develop their capacities for managing chemicals. 

Need for further action

The  impacts  of  chemicals  on  human  health  are  still  not  well  understood.  While
progress has been made over the years in both collecting and assessing data, new and more
sophisticated tools will be needed to assess more chemicals more quickly, as well as new
types  of  chemicals  (such  as  those  developed  from  manufactured  nanomaterials),  and
specific effects (such as endocrine disrupters, see Box 6.8). In addition, more remains to be
done at all levels to ensure the sound management of chemicals over their life cycle – from
production to use and disposal – to minimise the negative impacts on human health and
the  environment.  There  is  a  need  to  move  towards  an  integrated  approach  to  the
assessment and management of chemicals, and this will include the factors described
below.

OECD ENVIRONMENTAL OUTLOOK TO 2050 © OECD 2012

315

6. HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENT

Co-operate and share in chemical assessment

Greater  co-operation  through  work  sharing  and  improved  assessment  tools  are
needed. Non-OECD countries, particularly the BRIICs, will need to do more to meet the
growing challenge of safely managing existing chemicals and new chemicals. Where not
already  in  place,  a  first  step  will  be  to  establish  chemical  inventories.  By  becoming
members of the MAD system, these countries will be able to work with OECD members to
share the burden of assessing existing chemicals. Greater international co-operation will
be needed to build capacity, share expertise and promote effective chemical management
globally.  Co-operation  will  also  be  needed  to  ensure  that  new  national  chemical
management systems do not lead to duplicative testing and assessments or to new trade
barriers. 

Improve data on chemical hazards and population exposure 

Greater  efforts  will  also  be  needed  to  identify  and  describe  how  individuals  and
populations are exposed to harmful chemicals, and to quantify sources of exposure. This is
likely to involve wider use of environmental public health surveillance, biomonitoring,
environmental  monitoring  and  other  evolving  public  health  information  research
techniques, as well as sharing such data across countries.

With  the  growing  number  of  current  and  planned  epidemiology  studies,  and  the
considerable volume of data being collected, it may be more efficient for countries to co-
ordinate their efforts. To this end, in 2009 the WHO published a guide on the design of birth
cohort  studies  (Golding et al.,  2009).  Another  international  initiative  (STROBE,  or
Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology) provides guidance
on reporting results for any kind of epidemiology study. In addition to these principles,
other areas of co-ordination could be developed. For example, creating an international
database of epidemiological studies listing the main features of studies (e.g. cohort size,
criteria for inclusion/exclusion, biological samples collected) would make existing work
and data more accessible and thus help in the design of future epidemiological studies. 

Improve emphasis on prevention, in particular at early life stages

Based on the recognition that foetuses and children are more vulnerable to harmful
chemicals  than  adults,  there  is  a  need  to  refocus  risk  assessments  on  the  effects  of
chemicals following prenatal and early life exposures. First, these are the most vulnerable
life stages and chemical exposure during this period may lead to significant disease in
children and adults. Second, they are the stages where preventive action may be the most
effective in terms of health and well-being, as well as in terms of economic benefits, such
as reduced health and education costs and increased national productivity. 

Promote sustainable use of chemicals and green chemistry

Green or “sustainable chemistry” concerns the design, manufacture and use of more
environmentally  friendly  chemicals  throughout  their  life  cycle.  It  contributes  to
sustainable development through the manufacture of products that are less harmful to
human health and the environment: i) through the use of less hazardous and harmful
feedstocks and reagents; ii) by improving the energy and material efficiency of chemical
processes;  iii) by using  renewable  feedstocks  or  wastes  in  preference  to fossil  fuels  or
mined resources; and iv) by designing chemical products for better reuse or recycling. A
recent report based on patent data shows that some green chemistry technologies, such as

316

OECD ENVIRONMENTAL OUTLOOK TO 2050 © OECD 2012

6. HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENT

biochemical fuel cells and green plastics, have grown at least seven times faster than the
rate of patents in the chemicals industry overall (OECD, 2011d). 

Significant gains can be made by providing positive support to help industry adopt
greener technologies. A number of governments provide financial support (grants and tax
preferences) for R&D expenditure on green chemistry. In the United States, grants are
provided under the EPA/National Science Foundation programme on “Technology for a
Sustainable  Environment”.17  In  Japan,  the  National  Institute  of  Advanced  Industrial
Science  and  Technology  undertakes  a  considerable  amount  of  research  on  green  and
sustainable  chemistry,  particularly in  the areas of catalysis,  membranes,  supercritical
fluids and renewable resources.  Awards have also  proven  to  be  a successful  means of
inducing  innovation  in  a  number  of  areas,  including  health  and  energy  technologies
(e.g. see Newell and Wilson, 2005). 

More  can  also  be  done  to  find  safer  substitutes  for  priority  chemicals.  Known  as
alternatives  assessments,  this  involves  evaluating  a  broad  range  of  health  and
environmental effects to ensure that safer alternatives are selected and to minimise the
potential  for  unintended  consequences.  By  identifying  and  evaluating  the  safety  of
alternative chemicals, this approach can encourage industry to move to safer alternatives,
it  can  complement  regulatory  action  by  showing  that  safer  and  higher  functioning
alternatives are available, or it can point out the limitations to chemical substitution for a
particular  use.  The  US  EPA’s  Design  for  the  Environment  programme  has  developed  a
methodology for chemical alternatives assessments (Lavoie et al., 2010). 

Improving the public’s right to know

OECD governments have developed information systems and other tools to enhance
public  access  to  chemical  hazard  data  and  risk  information  prepared  by  government
chemical review programmes. These tools, including the OECD’s eChemPortal,18 support
long-standing  international  commitments  (e.g. under  SAICM)  to  improve  the  public
availability of data on chemicals. They also make these efforts more transparent. However,
more information on the constituents and effects of chemicals, for example in articles,
food or cosmetics, should be made available to comply with the public’s right to know
about chemical exposures and health and environmental risk factors.

5. Climate change

The  Intergovernmental  Panel  on  Climate  Change’s  Fourth  Assessment  report
concluded, with a very high degree of confidence,19 that climate change is contributing to
the global burden of disease and causing premature deaths, and that while currently these
effects are small, they are “projected to progressively increase in all countries and regions”
(Confalonieri et al.,  2007;  Chapter 3).  Climate  change  affects  human  health  adversely
through extremes in temperature, weather disasters, photochemical air pollutants, vector-
borne and rodent-borne diseases, and food-related and waterborne infections (Box 6.10).
The  impacts  may be direct  –  such  as  temperature-related  mortality (i.e. heat and  cold
stress) – or indirect by increasing the incidence of flooding, malnutrition, diarrhoea and
malaria (Campbell-Lendrum et al., 2003). The WHO estimates that in 2004, around 3% of all
deaths globally from diarrhoea, malaria and dengue fever were caused by climate change
(McMichael et al., 2004; WHO, 2009b).  In  many cases, those regions  which  will be most
affected will be the poorest and least able to respond to such impacts. 

OECD ENVIRONMENTAL OUTLOOK TO 2050 © OECD 2012

317

6. HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENT

Box 6.10. Climate change, health determinants and health impacts: Facts and figures
Air. Extreme high air temperatures can kill directly; it has been estimated that more than 70 000 excess
deaths were recorded in the extreme heat of summer 2003 in Europe (Robine et al., 2008). By the second half
of this century, such extreme temperatures will be the norm (Beniston and Diaz, 2004). In addition, rising
air temperatures will increase levels of important air pollutants such as ground-level ozone, particularly in
areas that are already polluted. Urban air pollution currently causes about 1.2 million deaths each year
(WHO, 2008, 2009a) mainly by increasing mortality from cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. 

Water. Shifting rainfall patterns, increased rates of evaporation and melting of glaciers, combined with
population and economic growth, are expected to increase the number of people living in water-stressed
water basins from about 1.5 billion in 1990 to 3-6 billion by 2050 (Arnell, 2004). By the 2090s, climate change
may bring a doubling in the frequency of extreme drought events, a sixfold increase in mean duration, and
a tenfold to thirtyfold increase in the land area in extreme drought (Burke et al., 2006). Almost 90% of the
burden of diarrhoeal disease is attributable to lack of access to safe water and sanitation (Prüss-Üstün and
Corvalán, 2006; Prüss-Üstün et al., 2004; WHO, 2009a) and reductions in the availability and reliability of
freshwater supplies are expected to amplify this hazard.

Food.  Increasing temperatures and more variable precipitation are expected to  reduce crop yields in
many tropical developing regions. In some African countries, yields from rain-fed agriculture could be
reduced  by up to 50% by 2020 (IPCC, 2007). This is likely  to aggravate  the burden  of undernutrition in
developing countries, which currently causes 3.5 million deaths each year, both directly through nutritional
deficiencies and indirectly by intensifying vulnerability to diseases such as malaria and diarrhoeal and
respiratory infections (Black et al., 2008; WHO, 2009a). 

Shelter. By the second half of this century, climate change is projected to cause a several-fold increase in
the  frequency  of  extreme  storms,  heavy  rainfall  and  heatwaves.  In  the  absence  of  improvements  to
protection, by 2080 sea level rise could also multiply the number of people exposed to coastal flooding more
than  tenfold, to  more  than 100 million people a year (IPCC, 2007). These trends will  also increase  the
hazards of weather-related natural disasters, which killed approximately 600 000 people during the 1990s
(Hales et al., 2003). Repeated floods and droughts may force population displacement – which, in turn, is
associated with heightened risks of a range of health effects, from mental disorders such as depression to
communicable diseases and, potentially, civil conflict.

Freedom from disease. Rising temperatures, shifting rainfall patterns and increasing humidity affect the
transmission of diseases by vectors and  through  water and  food. Vector-borne diseases currently kill
approximately 1.1 million people a year, and diarrhoeal diseases 2.2 million (WHO, 2008). Studies suggest
that climate change may swell the population at risk of malaria in Africa by 170 million by 2030 (Hay et al.,
2006) and the global population at risk of dengue by 2 billion by the 2080s (Hales et al., 2002).

Health equity. Climate change and associated development patterns threaten to widen existing health
inequalities  between and within populations. A WHO assessment of the burden of  disease caused by
climate change suggested that the modest warming that has occurred since the 1970s was already causing
over 140 000 excess deaths annually by the year 2004 (McMichael et al., 2004; WHO, 2009a). The estimated
per-capita  impacts  were  many times  greater  in  regions  that  already  had  the  greatest  disease  burden
(McMichael et al., 2004; Patz et al., 2007). Health benefits of climate change – mainly decreased mortality
from cold winters – are less strongly supported by evidence; to the extent that they do occur, they are
expected  to benefit mainly  populations in high-latitude developed  countries  (Confalonieri et al.,  2007;
McMichael et al., 2004). The ongoing process of climate change is therefore likely to widen the existing
health disparities between the richest and the poorest populations.

Climate change and malaria: A case study

The OECD Environmental Outlook Baseline focuses on malaria as the most important
infectious  disease  that  is  exacerbated  by  climate  change.  Some  other  health-related
impacts  of  climate  change  are  covered  elsewhere  in  this  Outlook  (e.g. for  diarrhoea,
see Section 3 of  this  chapter;  for  flooding,  see Chapter 5;  and  for  agricultural  yields,
see Chapter 2). While climate change has other types of health impacts, such as heat and
cold stress, they are not modelled for this Outlook. 

Currently, more than half of the world’s population, around 3.7 billion, lives in areas
where there is a potential risk of malaria (i.e. areas which are a suitable habitat for the
malaria mosquito), and this number is expected to grow to 5.7 billion people by 2050.20
By 2050, the bulk of the population living in potential malaria risk areas will be in Asia
(3.2 billion) and Africa (1.6 billion) (Figure 6.14). However, in many areas these risks have
been greatly reduced by vector control programmes, with the exception of Africa, where
more than 90% of all malaria deaths occurred in 2004.

Despite  the  greater  number  of  people  living  in  malaria  risk  areas,  the  OECD
Environmental Outlook Baseline projects that from 2010 to 2050 global premature mortality
from malaria will actually fall significantly (Figure 6.15).21 This is due to the projected
greater urbanisation, increased per-capita income (which supports adaptation approaches
and health treatments) and the ageing of the population (children are the most vulnerable
to malaria). Climate change only plays a limited role in future projections of changes in the
disease burden due to malaria. However, even with this significant reduction in premature

global mortality, in 2050 it is estimated that there will still be almost 400 000 premature
deaths from malaria, with almost all occurring in Africa. 

To understand whether alternative climate policy scenarios would make a difference to
malaria incidence, the 450 Core scenario described in Chapter 3 was extended to assess the
impact of this policy scenario on malaria incidence. The 450 Core scenario models a climate
change mitigation pathway that limits the global average temperature increase to below 2 oC
by the end of the 21st century. This is compared to the Baseline, which being a no-new-policy
scenario, projects that global mean temperature would increase by between 3 and 6 oC by the
end of the century. The extended 450 Core simulation implies that there would be only a small
reduction in the number of people at risk of malaria compared to the Baseline. Some areas
would become more prone to the malarial mosquito (such as the Ethiopian highlands), while
other areas would not. Overall, the differences in the size of the malaria-suitable areas
(i.e., areas with suitable climatic conditions) between the Baseline and policy scenario are small,
and thus the change in impact on human health would be minimal. 

Considerable  knowledge  exists  on  ways  to  prevent  and  counteract  outbreaks  of
malaria  –  this  knowledge  must  be  used  to  prevent  the  potential  spread  of  malaria.
Adaptation options include better surveillance and development of early warning systems
for potential outbreaks, clearing susceptible habitats, vector control programmes such as
distribution of mosquito nets, R&D on vector control, vaccines and disease eradication, and
better design of buildings and housing structures. Governments and relevant international
organisations should work together to systematically map potential new areas for malaria
and design appropriate policy instruments. These could include incentives for R&D as well
as regulatory incentives (e.g. building codes and insurance).

Notes
1.  Particulate matter discussed in this section includes PM10 (particulate matter with a diameter of
less than or equal to 10 micrometres) and PM2.5 (particulate matter with a diameter of less than or
equal to 2.5 micrometres).

2. Although  the  World  Bank  data  were  compiled  in 2001,  they  still  represent  the  best  global  and

consistent data which are necessary for modelling.

3. Information  on  a  large  number  of  economic  instruments  and  voluntary  approaches  for  air
pollution can be found in the OECD/EEA database on instruments used for environmental policy,
at www.oecd.org/env/policies/database. 

4. When in a gaseous form, HCs are called volatile organic compounds (VOCs).
5. OECD (2010a) gives an in-depth discussion of the NOx tax in Sweden, including its impacts on the

environment and on innovation.

6. The  upper  limit  on  new  vehicles’  emissions  of  NOx  in  the  European  Union  were,  in 2008,
0.06 grams per km for petrol-driven vehicles and 0.2 grams per km for diesel-driven ones – more
than three times higher. There are also indications that the tightening of the emission standards
over the years in practice have had modest impact on real-world NOx emissions from diesel-driven
vehicles, (Carslaw et al., 2011).

7. As an illustration, under current tax rates and assuming everything else is unchanged, the tax on
a car that emits 0.75 grams of CO, 0.05 grams HC and 0.03 grams NOx per km driven would have
been EUR 977 lower if the tax had only taken CO2 emissions into account and ignored the other
emission categories.

8. For  purposes  of  this  simulation,  it  is  recognised  that  reducing  emissions  relatively  uniformly
across the globe will lead to variations in mortality rates across countries due to differences in
existing  concentrations  in  countries  and  the  degree  to  which  they  are  above  or  below  health
threshold levels.

9. Under the approach used for these calculations, the VSL values vary with income; i.e., they are
lower  in  countries  with  lower  per-capita  GDP.  This  allows  for  local  preferences  to  be  more
accurately represented in decision making; however, it also means that a global view of the scale
of a particular environmental action, and the case for concerted international finance, is less clear.

10. Secondary treatment refers to treatment of (urban) wastewater by a process generally involving
biological treatment with a secondary settlement or other process, resulting in a BOD (organic
content) removal of at least 70% and a COD (chemical content) removal of at least 75%. Tertiary
treatment refers to treatment (additional to secondary treatment) of nitrogen and/or phosphorous
and/or  any  other  pollutant  affecting  the  quality  or  a  specific  use  of  water  (microbiological
pollution, colour, etc.). 

11. The associated costs for these connection rates are based on Hutton and Haller (2004) who made
estimates of annual costs of the various levels of connection rates. Their annual cost assumptions
are based on investment and recurrent costs, using values from the literature. For example, the
annual costs  for  in-house  piped water  are  USD  10-15 per  person, while  other  improved water
supply connections range from USD 1-4 per person. It is important to note that the costs in the
OECD Outlook simulation are approximate since the categories and  regions do not fully match
those of Hutton and Haller. In addition, translating initial investment costs to annual costs might
underestimate the costs when using them over time. See Annex 5.A at the end of Chapter 5 for
more details on the assumptions behind this scenario.

12. Currently 39 countries have an operational PRTR system: all 27 EU countries, 3 European Economic
Area (EEA) countries (Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway) and 9 other countries: 8 OECD countries
(Australia, Canada, Chile, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Switzerland and the United States), and Croatia.
New Zealand does not have a single  integrated PRTR but each of the 16 New Zealand regional
authorities is responsible for implementing national environmental standards and independently
manages and maintains information on resource consent, including pollutant discharges. Turkey
and Israel have each completed a PRTR Pilot Project.

20. For more discussion of the modelling approach used for projecting malaria risk, see Annex 6.A.

21. The modelling for malaria risk areas is based on a simple relationship between climatic conditions
and  the  suitability  for  the  malaria  mosquito.  In  practice,  however,  other  factors  such  as  the
amount and types of vegetation and the presence of still water are also of relevance. In addition,
due to the lack of global data, future vector control programmes have not been considered.

ANNEX 6.A 

Modelling Background Information on Health 

and Environment

This  annex  describes  the  most  important  aspects  of  the  Global  Integrated
Sustainability Model (GISMO), which is a part of the IMAGE suite (see Chapter 1 and Annex
on the Modelling Framework), and which was used for modelling the health impacts in this
chapter (see Hilderink and Lukas, 2008). 

Health impact modelling

The main purpose of the health model is to describe the burden of disease by gender
and age. The methodology used for communicable (infectious) diseases – such as malaria,
diarrhoea, lower respiratory infections, protein deficiency and AIDS (Figure 6.A1) is a multi-
state  modelling  approach  which  largely  follows  the  approach  as  described  in  the  World
Health  Report 2002  (WHO,  2002a)  and  the  Disease  Control  Priorities  Project  (DCPP)
(Cairncross  and  Valdmanis,  2006).  The  states  distinguished  are  exposure,  disease  and
death. This implies that for various health risk factors, incidence and case fatality rates
(i.e. the ratio of  the number  of deaths caused by  a  specified disease  over the number of
diagnosed cases of that disease) are taken into account. Some risk factors (such as children
who  are  underweight)  can  also  enhance  other  risk  factors  (e.g. lack  of  improved  water
supply). The level of health services can also modify these rates. The method for projecting
the  other  causes  of  death  –  i.e.  non-communicable  (chronic)  diseases,  remainder  of
communicable  and  injuries –  is  based  on  Mathers  and  Loncar  (2006)  who  developed  a
method to link changes in mortality rates for the most important causes of death to factors
such as GDP, smoking behaviour and human capital. This method was used for the global
burden  of  disease  projections  (WHO,  2002b)  and  has  also  been  included  in  the  health
model. The projections of cause-specific mortality are used to determine the attributable
(and avoidable) relative risks on mortality, as reported in literature.

Valuing health impacts

The modelling of the health impacts results in cause-specific deaths by sex and age for
the various regions distinguished in the model. These impacts are expressed in monetary
terms by using the value of statistical life (VSL) (see Holland et al., 2005). The estimate used
for  the  VSL  is  based  on  OECD  and  values  USD  3.5 million  (2005 USD)  for  OECD  regions
(OECD, 2011e). The value for the other regions has been derived based on their per-capita
GDP on purchasing power parity assuming an elasticity of 0.8. The future value of VSL is
directly calculated based on changes in GDP per capita.

Indoor air pollution

The main risk factor for lower respiratory infections (LRI), or pneumonia, is indoor air
pollution,  caused  by  cooking  and/or  heating  with  solid  fuels.  The  effect  is  increased  in
children who are underweight. The exposure to indoor air pollution modelling is based on
the  Residential  Energy  Model  Global  (REMG,  van Ruijven, 2008).  Indoor  air  pollution  not
only increases the risk of pneumonia mortality, but also of chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease  (COPD)  and  lung  cancer.  Other  diseases  are  suspected  to  be  related  to  this  risk
factor,  but  evidence  for  these  diseases  is  limited  and  they  are  not  included.  The  health
effects of exposure to this risk factor can, however, be lowered by proper ventilation when
cooking and heating. The methodology to describe the burden of disease attributable to
this risk factor is adopted from the WHO (Desai et al., 2004). 

Water supply and sanitation

Model  projections  concerning  levels  of  water  supply  and  sanitation  are  mostly
described  in  the  Annex  to  Chapter 5 of  this  Outlook.  Note  that  for  the  analysis  in  this
chapter, separate levels of connection rates to water supplies and sanitation facilities are

328

6. HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENT

calculated for urban and rural populations. This makes it possible to determine the urban
and rural diarrhoeal burden of disease. Given the different levels of connection to water
supply and sanitation facilities in the regions, relative risks are used to calculate incidence
levels,  based  on  the  so-called  “realistic  scenario”  used  in  the  DCPP  (Cairncross  and
Valdmanis, 2006). The incidence is modified by the level to which a child is underweight
(distinguished  by  mild,  moderate  and  severe  underweight;  see Edejer et al.,  2005)  and
temperature levels (McMichael, 2004). The case fatality rates are modified by underweight
levels and the use of oral rehydration therapy (ORT). Underweight levels are derived from
the average levels of food consumption.

Malaria

The  methodology  for  estimating  malaria  risk  is  based  on  the  MARA/ARMA  malaria
suitability model (Craig et al., 1999) which maps areas which are suitable for the malaria
mosquito  based  on  climatic  factors.  Mosquitoes  which  spread  the  infection  can  only
survive in climates with high average temperatures, no frost and sufficient precipitation.
For  each  climatic  factor,  a  suitability  index  is  calculated  which  indicates  the  conditions
under which the malaria mosquito is able to survive. The climatic levels required for the
maximum suitability of 1, and for the minimum suitability of 0, are shown in Table 6.A1.
For  indicators  with  levels  between  those  required  for  0 and 1 suitability,  a  level  is
calculated by using a simple function (Craig et al., 1999). All these factors are calculated at
half-by-half degree geographic grid level, making use of the output from the IMAGE model
(Bouwman et al., 2006). Total climatic malaria suitability for each grid cell is determined by
the lowest of these three indices.

This model was originally developed for Africa, where most malaria cases and deaths
occur, but for GISMO, this model is applied worldwide. Based on climatic malaria suitability,
the  potential  population  at  risk  of  malaria  is  estimated.  Malaria  control  has  reduced  or
eliminated  malaria  vectors  in  most  regions  outside  Africa  and,  therefore,  needs  to  be
considered. Future vector control programmes are assumed not to change. Insecticide treated
bed  nets  and  indoor  residual  spraying  are  modelled  separately  as  potential  policy  options,
which modify incidence rates. Case fatality of malaria is modified by the level to which a child
is underweight and case management (i.e. diagnosis and treatment) (Morel et al., 2005).

Outdoor air pollution

The  modelling  of  air  pollution  presented  in  this  chapter  involved  several  aspects,
namely health impacts related to particulate matter (PM), ground-level ozone, the policy
simulations performed by WorldScan, and a simulation of a 25% Air Pollution Reduction
Scenario. Each is discussed in turn below.

OECD ENVIRONMENTAL OUTLOOK TO 2050 © OECD 2012

6. HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENT

Particulate matter

The  Global  Urban  Air  quality  Model  (GUAM)  has  been  developed  to  estimate
PM10 concentrations and their attributable effects on human health for more than 3 200
“major” cities in the world (i.e. cities with populations over 100 000 or national capitals). GUAM
originates from the GMAPS model (Pandey et al, 2006) and links observed PM10 concentrations
to  a  set  of  variables  of  economic  activity,  population,  urbanisation  and  meteorological
information. 

Based  on  these  concentration  levels,  the  health  effects  (acute  respiratory  diseases,
lung  cancer,  and  cardiopulmonary  diseases)  of  the  population  being  exposed  are
determined. Health impacts are based on the assumption “one population – one average
exposure level”. This means that the exposure of the urban population is estimated as the
modelled average urban concentration. Concentration gradients within the city (e.g. hot-
spots), different exposures for different population classes and indoor pollution have not
been considered. The assessment does not incorporate the effects of ambient air pollution
on the population living in cities with less than 100 000 inhabitants or on rural populations.
Other assumptions and uncertainties are outlined in Box 6.A1.

Box 6.A1. Assumptions and uncertainties in the models

i)

 Most of the empirical data on PM10 concentrations comes from developed countries,
where concentrations tend to be lower than in developing countries. These data are
used to estimate concentrations in all 3 245 cities, which leads to uncertainties when
extrapolating to cities with high concentrations. 

ii) Since data on PM2.5 concentrations are scarce (compared to PM10 concentrations), it is
assumed  that PM2.5 concentrations can be derived by  applying  a PM10-PM2.5  ratio
which is based on relatively few observations. The ratios vary from 0.4 in Brazil to
0.65 in most OECD countries. Concentrations are modelled following the World Bank
Global Model of Ambient Particulates (GMAPS; Pandey et al., 2006) approach using local
and national data on emissions, wind speed, urban density and precipitation, with
emissions weighted the highest of all these factors. 

iii) Health  impacts  are  based  on  exposure-response  relationships  (described  in  the
literature), and it is assumed that these relationships are the same across the globe
and stay constant over time. 
It  is  assumed  that  no  additional  human  health  effects  will  occur  beyond  150 µg/m3
concentrations of PM10 (i.e. health impacts at PM10 concentrations above 150 µg/m3
will be no more severe than at 150 µg/m3). 

iv)

v) The modelling only includes deaths caused by PM pollution, and thus underestimates
the true impacts on human health (i.e. it does not consider non-lethal effects such as
chronic and acute bronchitis, asthma, etc.). As described in Box 6.2, the ageing of the
population  has  a  strong  influence  on  the  number  of  premature  deaths  from  air
pollution in all country groupings.

Ground-level ozone 

Global mean ozone concentrations in the troposphere (i.e. ground level) are modelled in
an atmospheric chemical “box model”. In a box model, the difference between the sources
and  sinks  of  a  component  is  calculated  and  converted  to  an  increase  or  decrease  in  the

330

OECD ENVIRONMENTAL OUTLOOK TO 2050 © OECD 2012

6. HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENT

atmospheric  concentration.  The  sources  taken  into  account  here  are  i) the  direct
anthropogenic  and  natural  emissions  of  ozone  precursors  –  CO,  NOx  and  VOCs  including
methane  (CH4);  and  ii) the  in  situ  production  or  losses  in  atmospheric  photochemical
processes and other losses like deposition or transport to the stratosphere. The chemistry is
described in a number of parameterised relations. Of crucial importance is the fate of the
hydroxyl radical (OH), the chemical species that initiates most of the atmospheric oxidation
processes. Changes in the production of OH depend on changes in tropospheric ozone, water
vapour, NOx emissions, stratospheric ozone and temperature. The loss of OH is governed by
the  levels  of  CH4,  CO  and  VOC.  As  the  life-time  of  the  other  gases  depends  on  the  OH
concentrations,  the  system  becomes  non-linear.  The  model  used  here  is  an  updated  and
extended version of the chemical module in the IMAGE model using the global atmospheric
chemistry  transport  model  TM5.  van  Aardenne et al.  (2010)  have  modelled  global  ozone
concentration  fields  for  nine  different  scenarios  for  the  period 2000-2050.  Using  these
results, a relation – as a function of CH4 and CO emissions – between the global mean ozone
concentration and the ozone concentration in the IMAGE regions has been established. Using
empirical  relations  (based  on  an  analysis  of  the  AirBase  data,  Mol et al.,  2011)  the  annual
mean and standard deviation of the maximum daily 8-hour mean are estimated. These two
parameters are sufficient to calculate the SOMO35 (i.e. the Sum of Ozone Means Over 35 ppb)
in each region.

Policy simulation with WorldScan

The  macroeconomic  consequences  of  specific  air  policy  simulations  are  assessed
using the global applied general equilibrium model WorldScan. A detailed description of
the model is given in Lejour et al. (2006). Bollen and Brink (2011) extended WorldScan to
also include emissions of air pollutants and the possibility to invest in emission control by
modelling abatement supply curves (i.e. marginal abatement cost curves) for emissions in
each sector. These abatement supply curves represent the potential and cost of technical
abatement  measures.  These  are  mainly  “end-of-pipe”  abatement  options,  removing
emissions largely without affecting the emission-producing activity itself. WorldScan data
for  the  base  year  are  to  a  large  extent  taken  from  the  GTAP-7 database  (Narayanan  and
Walmsley,  2008)  that  provides  integrated  data  on  bilateral  trade  flows  and  input-output
accounts. The version used here features 25 regions and 13 sectors. WorldScan is set up to
simulate deviations from a “business as usual” (BAU) path by imposing specific additional
policy measures such as taxes or restrictions on emissions. The BAU used here is calibrated
on  the  time  series  for  population  and  GDP  by  region,  energy  use  by  region  and  energy
carrier, and world fossil fuel prices by energy carrier as assumed in the Baseline. Data on
emissions  of  air  pollutants  are  taken  from  IMAGE,  whereas  the  technical  abatement
potential  and  cost  was  based  on  data  for 2030  in  the  GAINS  model  (IIASA,  2011).
Beyond 2030, an autonomous  reduction  in marginal  abatement costs is  assumed within
each sector of 0.5% per year. This autonomous cost reduction is apart from changes in the
prices of inputs that are required to produce the emission abatement (such as labour and
capital)  which  is  endogenous  in  the  model.  Moreover,  to  reflect  a  certain  rate  of
technological improvement, the maximum feasible reduction potential (as a percentage of
unabated emissions) is assumed to increase by 0.5%. 

Environmental  policies  are  implemented  in  the  model  by  introducing  a  price  on
emissions  (Lejour et al.,  2006).  This  emission  price  makes  polluting  activities  more
expensive and will provide an incentive to reduce these emissions. For emissions directly

331

6. HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENT

related to the use of a specific input, such as fossil fuels, the emission price will in fact
cause  a  rise  in  the  user  price  of  this  input.  Consequently,  this  will  lead  to  a  fall  in  the
demand for it (either by using less energy or by substituting more carbon emitting fuels for
less emitting ones) and hence a reduction in emissions. For emissions related to sectoral
output  levels,  the  emission  price  will  cause  a  rise  in  the  output  price  of  the  associated
product. Again, this will lead to a fall in demand for this product and hence in a reduction
in  emissions.  Moreover,  if  emission  control  options  are  available,  these  will  be
implemented  up  to  the  level  where  the  marginal  cost  of  emission  control  equals  the
emission  price.  The  emission  price  can  be  introduced  exogenously,  but  in  the  policy
scenario presented here, a restriction is put on the weighted sum of emissions of different
air  polluting  substances,  leading  to  a  reduction  in  emissions  of  25%  compared  to  the
Baseline.  Weights  are  based  on  the  relative  contribution  of  these  substances  to  PM
exposure. In this case the emission price is endogenously determined in the model at the
level needed to reduce emissions to the predetermined emission target, which represents
the shadow price of this restriction. As in some regions (in particular those with a small
share of anthropogenic emissions in the total emissions of air pollutants) a reduction in
emissions by 25% requires a very high emission price, an upper bound on the emission
price  was  introduced,  which  is  related  to  the  VSL  in  a  region.  Consequently,  the  actual
emission reduction is not equal to 25%, as in some regions the emission price would have
to exceed this upper bound in order to achieve a 25% emission reduction.

The 25% Air Pollution Reduction scenario

The goal of this simulation was to reduce particulate matter concentrations; however,
to achieve a reduction in PM concentrations, one has to reduce the emissions which are
contributing  to  PM  (i.e. NOx,  SO2  and  black  carbon).  The  health  impacts  were  estimated
based on exposure to both particulate matter and ozone formed from NOx, SO2 and black
carbon.  Emission  taxes  were  used  as  a  proxy  for  policies  triggering  the  reduction  in  air
emissions  (i.e. to  increase  the  cost  of  polluting  activities)  and  therefore  reduce  emissions
through: i) structural changes (e.g. shifts to less polluting energy sources, energy efficiency
improvements,  shifts  in  demand,  changes  in  location  of  economic  activities);  and
ii) installing  end-of-pipe  measures  to  remove  PM-related  emissions  (e.g. using  scrubbers/
filters). The reduction in mortality was translated into economic benefits by applying a value
of statistical life (VSL), and these results were then compared to the costs of the policies to
provide a rough approximation of the benefit/cost for each region. Under the approach used
for these calculations, the VSL values vary with income: i.e. they are lower in countries with
lower per-capita GDP. This allows for local preferences to be more accurately represented in
decision  making;  however,  it  also  means  that  a  global  view  of  the  scale  of  a  particular
environmental action, and the case for concerted international finance, is less clear.

For  purposes  of  this  simulation,  it  is  recognised  that  reducing  emissions  relatively
uniformly across the globe will lead to variations in mortality rates across countries due to
differences  in  existing  concentrations  and  the  degree  to  which  they  are  above  or  below
health threshold levels.

Introduction

The  analysis  for  the  OECD  Environmental  Outlook  is  supported  by  two  modelling
frameworks that have been coupled: i) the ENV-Linkages economic model; and ii) a set of
environmental models linked to the Integrated Model to Assess the Global Environment
(IMAGE)  framework  created  by  the  PBL  Netherlands  Environmental  Assessment  Agency
(PBL  for  short).  This  annex  summarises  the  models  and  provides  web-links  to  more  in-
depth  descriptions.  The  methods  of  analysis  and  tools  used  in  the  OECD  Environmental
Outlook are more fully described in background documentation available at www.oecd.org/
environment/outlookto2050.

A short overview of the ENV-Linkages model1

The OECD’s ENV-Linkages general equilibrium (GE) model is an economic model that
describes how economic activities are linked to each other across sectors and regions. It
also  links  economic  activity  to  environmental  pressures,  specifically  to  emissions  of
greenhouse gases (GHGs). The model projects these links between economic activities and
emissions  several  decades  into  the  future  to  shed  light  on  the  medium-  and  long-term
impacts  of  environmental  policies.  The  advantages  of  multi-sectoral,  multi-regional
dynamic GE models like ENV-Linkages are numerous, and include their global dimension,
their  overall  consistency  and  the  fact  that  they  build  on  rigorous  microeconomic
foundations.  These  models  are  best  suited  for  analysing  the  medium-  and  long-term
implications  of  large  policy  shifts  requiring  significant  reallocation  across  sectors  and
countries/regions, as well as the associated spill-over effects. In that sense, these models
are the tools of choice for assessing a wide range of climate change policies.

ENV-Linkages is the successor to the OECD GREEN model, initially developed by the
OECD’s  Economics  Department  (Burniaux, et al., 1992)  and  is  now  hosted  by  the  OECD
Environment Directorate. Much of the applied work carried out with the model has been
reported  in  various  chapters  of  the  OECD  Environmental  Outlook  to 2030  (OECD, 2008).  An
updated version of the model was used extensively in the joint project between the OECD
Economics  Department  and  the  OECD  Environment  Directorate  on  the  economics  of
climate change mitigation (OECD, 2009). Most recently, the model has been used to study
the  impacts  of  phasing  out  fossil  fuels  subsidies  (IEA,  OPEC,  OECD,  World Bank, 2010;
Burniaux and Chateau, 2011); the impacts of border-tax adjustments (Burniaux et al., 2010);

ANNEX A. MODELLING FRAMEWORK

direct  and  indirect  linking  of  carbon  markets  (Dellink  et al., 2010a);  and  the  costs  and
effectiveness of the Copenhagen pledges (Dellink et al., 2010b). A more detailed overview of
the ENV-Linkages version 3, as used for this OECD Environmental Outlook to 2050, is provided
in Chateau et al. (2012).

How does it work?

ENV-Linkages is built primarily on a database of national economies. In the version of
the model used here, the world economy is divided into 15 countries/regions (see Chapter 1,
Table 1.3), each with 26 economic sectors, including 5 electricity sectors (see Table A.1 below).
Each of the regions is underpinned by an economic input-output table (usually published by a
national statistical agency). These tables identify all the inputs into an industry (rather than
individual firms) and identify all the industries that buy specific products. Some industries
explicitly  use  land,  while  others,  such  as  fisheries  and  forestry,  also  have  a  “natural
resource” input – e.g. fish and trees.

Since it is an economic model, ENV-Linkages does not represent physical processes.
Instead,  physical  processes  are  summarised  from  empirically  derived  relationships
between inputs and outputs. That is, industries are observed over time to be able to vary
the use of inputs such as labour, capital, energy and materials (see below – production).

The core of the model for the base year is formed by a set of Social Account Matrices
(SAMs)  that  describe  how  economic  sectors  are  linked;  these  are  based  on  the  GTAP
database.2 Many key parameters are based on information drawn from various empirical
studies and data sources (see Chateau et al., 2011).

Income generated by economic activity ultimately reflects expenditures on goods and
services  by  consumers  (such  as  households  and  government).  The  ENV-Linkages  model
assumes a representative household that reflects the average household of the region and
that  allocates  their  disposable  income  among  consumer  goods  and  savings.  They  are
assumed to base their decisions on static expectations about prices and quantities in the
current  time  period,  rather  than  to  have  forward-looking  behaviour.  This  means  that

335

ANNEX A. MODELLING FRAMEWORK

consumers are saving a proportion of their income and not adjusting that to reflect future
events  that  may  affect  income.  Household  consumption,  demand  and  savings  are
implemented  through  an  “Extended  Linear  Expenditure  System”.  Since  consumers  are
assumed  not  to  have  forward-looking  behaviour,  some  care  needs  to  be  exercised  in
studying  policies  that  consumers  may  reasonably  be  expected  to  anticipate –  either  the
policy itself or its consequences. Investment – net-of-economic depreciation – is equal to
the sum of government savings, consumer savings and net capital flows from abroad.

Production in the model is represented using a nested sequence of constant elasticity
of  substitution  (CES)  functions  (see Figure A.1  for  a  stylised  representation  of  this
structure). Four types of input factors are specified: labour, capital, energy and a sector-specific
natural resource (e.g. land). Production is assumed to operate under cost minimisation, perfect
markets and constant returns to scale technology. The substitutability between inputs means
that the intensity of using capital, energy, labour and land changes when their relative price
changes:  for  example,  as  labour  becomes  more  expensive,  less  of  it  is  used  relative  to
capital, energy and land. The possibilities to shift away from expensive inputs is however
limited.  Specific  sectors,  such  as  in  agriculture  or  energy  production,  have  an  adjusted
production function to reflect the specifics of that sector (e.g. fertiliser use is linked to land
use for crop production).

World trade in ENV-Linkages is based on a set of regional bilateral flows. In each region,
total import demand for each good is allocated across trading partners according to the
relationship between their export prices. Allocation of trade between partners responds to
changes  in  relative  prices  between  regions.  This  specification  of  imports  –  commonly
referred  to  as  the  Armington  specification –  formally  implies  that  each  region  faces  a
reduction in demand for its exports if domestic prices increase. Exchange rates between
regions adjust to ensure that trade balances are not affected by the policies.

The  government  in  each  region  collects  various  kinds  of  taxes  in  order  to  finance
government  expenditures.  For  simplicity  it  is  assumed  in  the  Baseline  that  these
expenditures grow at the same rate as the real GDP. Assuming a given stream of public
savings (or deficits), the government budget is balanced through the adjustment of a lump-
sum transfer (tax) to the household.

Market  goods  equilibrium  implies  that,  on  the  one  side,  the  total  production  of  any
good or service is equal to the demand addressed to domestic producers plus exports; and,
on  the  other  side,  the  total  demand  is  allocated  between  the  demands  (both  final  and
intermediary)  addressed  to  domestic  producers  and  the  import  demand.  The  general
equilibrium  framework  ensures  that  a  unique  set  of  relative  prices  emerges  such  that
demand equals supply in all markets simultaneously (i.e. across all regions, commodities,
and factors of production). All prices are expressed relatively to the numéraire of the price
system that is chosen as the index of OECD manufacturing exports prices. Implementation
of  a  policy  in  the  model  leads  to  a  new  equilibration  process  and  thus  a  new  set  of
equilibrium prices and quantities to compare with the original equilibrium.

The  land-based  sectors,  including  three  agricultural  sectors  and  forestry,  provide
direct  links  to  indicators  for  climate  change  (e.g. emissions  from  deforestation),
biodiversity  (e.g. land  under  forest  cover)  and  water.  The  recently  improved  land-use
module of ENV-Linkages is calibrated to mimic land-use relations in the coupled IMAGE-
LEITAP models described below. The underlying complexities of the land model in IMAGE,
and its detailed links with the agricultural model LEITAP (see below), are approximated in

ENV-Linkages  in  a  stylised  and  aggregated  manner  where  region-  and  sector-specific
elasticities are used to represent the possibilities to change between different land uses,
such as transforming grazing land into cropland.

The  structure  of  energy  inputs  in  production  is  of  particular  interest  for  analysing
climate  change  and  health  impacts  of  local  air  pollution.  In  the  model,  energy  is  a
composite of fossil fuels and electricity. In turn, fossil fuel is a composite of coal and the
other  fossil  fuels  (crude  oil,  refined  oil  products  and  gas  products).  A  higher  degree  of
substitution is assumed among the other fuels than with electricity and coal.

CO2 emissions from the combustion of energy in the model are directly linked to the
use  of  different  fuels  in  production.  Other  GHG  emissions  are  linked  to  output.  The
following  non-CO2  emission  sources  are  considered:  i) methane  from  rice  cultivation,

ANNEX A. MODELLING FRAMEWORK

livestock production (enteric fermentation and manure management), coal mining, crude
oil extraction, natural gas and services (landfills); ii) nitrous oxide from crops (nitrogenous
fertilisers),  livestock  (manure  management),  chemicals  (non-combustion  industrial
processes) and services (landfills); iii) industrial gases (SF6, PFCs and HFCs) from chemicals
industry  (foams,  adipic  acid,  solvents),  aluminium,  magnesium  and  semi-conductors
production.  These  emissions  are  calibrated  with  historical  data  collected  by  the
International  Energy  Agency  (IEA, 2010a).  For  non-CO2  GHGs  data  the  IEA  relies  on  the
EDGAR 4.1 database developed by PBL. For projections of future non-CO2 emissions and for
allocation  of  different  sources  to  activities  by  the  different  economic  sectors  the  model
uses information provided by the United States Environmental Protection Agency.

How is the model used to make projections?

ENV-Linkages  uses  a  complex  approach  for  its  projections.  Unlike  models  which
assume  that  the  economy  is  on  a  steady-state  growth  path,  it  is  able  to  produce  more
realistic patterns of the major variables over the model horizon.

The process of calibrating the ENV-Linkages model is broken down into three stages

(cf. Chateau et al., 2012):

i) A  number  of  parameters  are  calibrated  to  represent  the  data  for 2004  as  an  initial

economic equilibrium. This process is referred to as the static calibration.

ii) The 2004 database is updated to 2007 by simulating the model dynamically to match
historical trends over this period. Price levels are further adjusted such that all values
in the model reflect 2010 real USD using purchasing power parities provided by the IMF.

iii) The  Baseline  projection  for  the  model  horizon 2008-2050 is  based  on  conditional
convergence  assumptions  about  labour  productivity  and  other  socio-economic  drivers
(demographic trends, future trends in energy prices and energy efficiency improvements;
see Duval  and  de  la  Maissonneuve,  2009).  These  convergence  assumptions  are  used  to
identify the evolution of key economic and environmental variables.

iv) The  Baseline  projection  is  then  obtained  by  running  the  model  dynamically  over  the
period 2007-2050, keeping these key variables exogenous but letting the model parameters
adjust  endogenously.  Thus,  the  model  parameters  are  calibrated  using  the  structural
relations of the model (production functions, household preferences, etc.) to mimic the
evolution of the key variables over time. It should be emphasised that when the policy
simulations  are  performed  on  this  calibrated  baseline,  the  model  parameters  are
exogenously fixed,  while  the model variables  are fully endogenous. For instance, while
GDP  is  exogenous  in  the  Baseline  projection,  it  becomes  fully  endogenous  in  policy
simulations.

The  Baseline  has  been  adjusted  to  incorporate  the  effects  of  the  economic  crisis
of 2008-2009 and medium-term projections made by the World Bank (2010), IMF (2010) and
OECD (2010). Note that while the Baseline assumes no new policies for the environmental
issues addressed in the Outlook, it does include the energy policies listed in the reference
(current policies) energy projections of the IEA (2009a&b; 2010b). It also assumes that the
EU  Emission  Trading  System  (EU-ETS)  is  implemented  between 2006  and 2012,  with  a
permit  price  that  would  rise  gradually  from  5 to  25 constant  USD  by 2012  and  is  not
extended thereafter.3

The IMAGE model suite4

ANNEX A. MODELLING FRAMEWORK

The scenarios and projections for the OECD Environmental Outlook are the result of an
integrated  analysis  of  the  economy-environment  interface.  The  previous  section  has
described  the  economic  modelling  (ENV-Linkages).  IMAGE  is  the  central  tool  for  the
environmental analysis. Data on economic activities described by ENV-Linkages steer the
IMAGE  framework,  which  is  a  suite  of  related  models  connected  through  harmonised
dataflows (Figure A.2).

IMAGE is a dynamic integrated assessment framework to model global change. It was
developed at the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) in the
Netherlands initially to assess the impact of anthropogenic climate change (Rotmans, 1990).
Later it was extended to include a more comprehensive coverage of global change issues
(IMAGE team,  2001).  The  main  objectives  of  IMAGE  today  are  to  contribute  to  scientific
understanding  and  support  decision  making  by  quantifying  the  relative  importance  of
major processes and interactions in the society-biosphere-climate system.

The IMAGE framework operates at a resolution of 24/26 world regions (see Table 1.3 in
Chapter 1) for most socio-economic parameters, and a geographical 0.5 × 0.5 degree5 grid
for  land  use  and  environmental  parameters.  This  medium  level  of  complexity  allows
analyses to take into account key characteristics of the physical world (e.g. local soil and
climate  characteristics  of  technology  detail)  without  excessive  calculation  times.  The
central  box  in  Figure A.2 contains  the  core  IMAGE  model  framework  used  for  this  OECD
Environmental Outlook. The current version is IMAGE 2.5, a further development of IMAGE
version 2.4, documented in Bouwman et al. (2006).

In  addition  to  the  simple  one-dimensional  relationship  between  economic  driving
forces and changes in the environment, the physical flows of energy and the availability of
land  are  important  drivers  and  sometimes  limiting  factors  to  developments  in  the
environment. In this Outlook, the latter have been taken explicitly into account and these
two groups of variables have a central position in the modelling framework: next to the link
from the economic modelling in ENV-Linkages to IMAGE, energy use is modelled in detail
in the TIMER model (Targets IMage Energy Regional Model), which looks at regional energy
consumption, energy efficiency improvements, fuel substitution, supply and trade of fossil
fuels  and  renewable  energy  technologies.  It  also  computes  emissions  of  GHGs,  ozone
precursors and acidifying compounds (see below). Land-use factors (agricultural demand,
production and trade) are processed through the LEITAP model (discussed further below).

Some of the models in Figure A.2 are described elsewhere in the Outlook, for example
see Annex 6.A in Chapter 6 on Health and Environment for more on the GISMO model for
health aspects of quality-of-life, and the GUAM and REMG models for outdoor and indoor
air quality.

Land and climate

An important aspect of the IMAGE model is the geographically explicit description of
land use and land-cover change. The model distinguishes 14 natural and forest land-cover
types  and  6 man-made  land-cover  types.  IMAGE’s  land  and  climate  module  computes
land-use  changes  based  on  regional  production  of  food,  animal  feed,  fodder,  grass  and
timber,  and  changes  in  natural  vegetation  due  to  climate  change.  This  also  allows
emissions  and  carbon  exchange  from  land-use  changes,  natural  ecosystems  and
agricultural  production  systems  to  be  calculated.  The  Atmospheric  Ocean  System  then

computes  changes  in  atmospheric  composition  and  climate  using  these  emissions,  and
the emissions from the TIMER model.

The  land-use  model  describes  both  crop  and  livestock  systems  on  the  basis  of
agricultural demand, demand for food and feed crops, animal products, energy crops and
forestry products. A crop module based on the FAO agro-ecological zones approach (FAO,
1978-1981) computes the spatially explicit yields of the different crop groups and pasture,
and the areas used for their production, as determined by climate and soil quality. Where
expansion of agricultural land is required, a rule-based “suitability map” determines the
order by which grid cells get selected on the basis of the grid cell’s potential crop yield, its
proximity to other agricultural areas, to water bodies and to human settlements. An initial
land-use map for 1970 is incorporated on the basis of satellite observations combined with

ANNEX A. MODELLING FRAMEWORK

statistical  information.  For  the  period 1970-2000,  the  model  is  calibrated  to  be  fully
consistent with FAO statistics. For the period 2001-2050 the simulations are driven by the
input  from  the  TIMER  model  and  LEITAP,  and  by  additional  scenario  assumptions,  for
example  on  technology  development,  yield  improvements  and  efficiency  of  animal
production systems.

Changes  in  natural  vegetation  cover  are  simulated  in  IMAGE 2.5 on  the  basis  of  a
modified version of the BIOME natural vegetation model (Prentice et al., 1992). This model
computes  changes  in  potential  vegetation  for  14 biome  types  on  the  basis  of  climate
characteristics.  The  potential  vegetation  is  the  equilibrium  vegetation  that  should
eventually develop under a given climate.

The  consequences  of  land  use  and  land-cover  changes  for  the  carbon  cycle  are
simulated by a geographically explicit terrestrial carbon cycle model. This simulates global
and  regional  carbon  pools  and  fluxes  (pools  include  the  living  vegetation,  and  several
stocks of carbon stored in soils). The model accounts for important feedback mechanisms
related  to  changing  climate  (e.g. different  growth  characteristics),  carbon  dioxide
concentrations  (carbon  fertilisation)  and  land  use  (e.g. conversion  of  natural  vegetation
into agricultural land or vice versa). In addition, it allows for an evaluation of the potential
for carbon sequestration by natural vegetation and carbon plantations.

The carbon cycle model also describes the carbon included in the atmospheric and
ocean  systems,  the  fluxes  between  these  systems,  and  their  subsequent  effect  on
atmospheric GHG concentrations and thus climate change (van Minnen et al., 2000).

The emissions of GHGs and air pollutants are used in IMAGE to calculate changes in
the concentrations of GHGs, ozone precursors and species involved in aerosol formation at
a  global  scale.  These  calculations,  except  for  CO2  (see carbon  cycle),  are  based  on  the
4th Assessment Report of the Intergovernment Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Changes in
climate  are  calculated  as  global  mean  changes  using  a  slightly  adapted  version  of  the
MAGICC 6.0 climate  model  which  is  also  extensively  used  by  the  IPCC  (Schaeffer  and
Stehfest, 2010). Climatic changes do not manifest themselves uniformly over the globe, and
patterns of temperature and precipitation change differ between different climate models.
Hence  changes  in  temperature  and  precipitation  in  each  0.5 × 0.5 degree  grid  cell  are
differentiated  using  the  IPCC  approach  to  produce  global  patterns.  This  includes  the
approach  proposed  by  Schlesinger et al.,  (2000)  to  account  for  the  regional  temperature
effect  of  short-lived  sulphate  aerosols.  IMAGE 2.5 uses  temperature  and  precipitation
projections from the HadCM2 climate model run by the UK’s Meteorological Office (data
obtained from the IPCC Data Distribution Centre).

Water stress 

Recently, the IMAGE land and climate model has been extended by coupling with the
LPJmL (Lund--Potsdam-Jena managed Land) model to better simulate the global terrestrial
carbon  cycle  and  natural  vegetation  distribution.  It  also  includes  a  global  hydrological
model  and  improved  crop  modelling  (Bouwman et al.,  2006).  The  LPJmL  model,  having
started  life  as  a  dynamic  global  vegetation  model  (Sitch et al.,  2003),  has  since  been
extended  to  include  managed  land  (Bondeau et al.,  2007)  and  the  hydrological  cycle
(Gerten et al., 2004). For this Outlook, IMAGE 2.5 was used without the coupled LPJmL model.
However, for the water stress analysis (Chapter 5) LPJmL was used as a stand-alone model.

OECD ENVIRONMENTAL OUTLOOK TO 2050 © OECD 2012

341

ANNEX A. MODELLING FRAMEWORK

LPJmL’s  hydrological  model  has  been  validated  against  discharge  observations  for
300 river  basins  worldwide  (Biemans et al.,  2009)  and  against  irrigation  water  use  and
consumption  (Rost et al.,  2008).  By  linking  with  the  LPJmL  hydrological  model,  IMAGE
scenarios now also model future changes in water availability, agricultural water use and
an indicator for water stress. Water availability in the form of renewable water supply is
computed by the hydrology module of the LPJmL model, although water in deep aquifers is
not considered. LPJmL also estimates the water demand for irrigation, starting from the
gap  between  precipitation  surplus  and  potential  evapotranspiration  for  the  crop  type(s)
grown  on  irrigated  land  (for  more  information,  see the  Annex 5.A to  Chapter 5).  Current
demand  for  other  sectors  (households,  manufacturing,  electricity  and  livestock)  is  adopted
from the WaterGAP model calculations for the OECD Environmental Outlook to 2030 (OECD, 2008).
The 2008  WaterGAP  projection  was  only  adjusted  for  differences  in  development  of  key
drivers  from  the 2008  Outlook,  such  as  industrial  value  added  and  (thermal)  electricity
production by fuel as projected with IMAGE-TIMER.

Agricultural land supply and use6

Land-use factors in IMAGE are processed through the LEITAP model to give sectoral
production growth rates, land-use change and the degree of intensification resulting from
endogenous  technological  improvement  estimated  by  FAO  (Bruinsma, 2003)  and  other
endogenous factors.

The  LEITAP  model  is  a  multi-regional,  multi-sectoral,  static,  applied  general
equilibrium model based on neo-classical microeconomic theory (Nowicki et al., 2006 and
van Meijl et al., 2006). It allows for the substitution of different primary production factors
(land,  labour,  capital  and  natural  resources)  and  intermediate  production  factors
(e.g. energy and animal feed components). It also allows for substitution between different
energy sources, including biofuels (Banse et al., 2008) and their by-products. Regional land
supply curves in LEITAP represent the total area available for agriculture, in the order of the
degree of suitability according to the IMAGE allocation rules. IMAGE also makes scenario-
specific assumptions about the breakdown of livestock production over different systems,
with consequences for feed composition, land conversion and overall productivity. 

To  model  biofuels  use  in  the  fuel  production,  the  GTAP-E  model  (Burniaux  and
Truong, 2002) was adopted and applied to the petrol sector, which allows for substitution
between crude oil, ethanol and biodiesel. The nested CES structure of GTAP-E implies that
biofuel demand is determined by the relative price of crude oil versus ethanol and biodiesel,
including taxes and subsidies. Substitution between the different fuels is assumed to be
almost perfect.

Regional  endowments  of  labour,  capital  and  natural  resources  are  fixed  and  fully
employed and land supply is modelled by land supply curves (Eickhout et al., 2008), which
specify  the  relationship  between  land  supply  and  a  land  rental  rate.  The  regional  land-
supply  curves  determine  how  additional  outputs  are  met  by  a  combination  of  land
expansion  and  intensity  of  land  use.  Labour  is  divided  into  two  categories:  skilled  and
unskilled. These categories are considered imperfect substitutes in the production process.
Land and natural resources are heterogeneous production factors, and this heterogeneity
is  introduced  by  a  constant  elasticity  of  transformation  (CET)  function  which  allocates
these production factors among the agricultural sectors. Capital and labour markets are
segmented between agriculture and non-agriculture. Labour and capital are assumed to be

ANNEX A. MODELLING FRAMEWORK

fully  mobile  within  each  of  these  two  groups  of  sectors,  but  imperfectly  mobile  across
them.

Energy7

The  global  energy  system  model  TIMER  (Targets  IMage  Energy  Regional  Model)  has
been developed to simulate long-term energy baseline and climate mitigation scenarios.
The model describes the investments in, and the use of, different types of energy options
influenced  by  technology  development  and  resource  depletion.  Inputs  to  the  model  are
macroeconomic  scenarios  and  assumptions  about  technology  development,  preference
levels  and  restrictions  to  fuel  trade  from  ENV-Linkages.  The  output  of  the  model
demonstrates  how  energy  intensity,  fuel  costs  and  competing  non-fossil  supply
technologies  develop  over  time.  It  generates  primary  and  final  energy  consumption  by
energy type, sector and region; capacity build-up and use; cost indicators; and GHG and
other emissions.

In  TIMER,  implementation  of  mitigation  is  generally  modeled  on  the  basis  of  price
signals (a tax on carbon dioxide). A carbon tax (used as a generic measure of climate policy)
induces additional investments in energy efficiency, fossil fuel substitution, and investments
in  bioenergy,  nuclear  power,  solar  power,  wind  power  and  carbon  capture  and  storage.
Selection of options throughout the model is based on a multinomial logic model that assigns
market  shares  on  the  basis  of  production  costs  and  preferences  (cheaper,  more  attractive
options get a larger market share; but there is no full optimisation) (de Vries et al., 2001).

The TIMER model describes the chain from demand for energy services (useful energy)
to  the  supply  of  energy  by  different  primary  energy  sources  and  related  emissions.  The
steps are connected by demand for energy (from left to right) and by feedbacks, mainly in
the  form  of  energy  prices  (from  right  to  left).  The  TIMER  model  has  three  types  of
submodels: i) the energy demand model; ii) models for energy conversion (electricity and
hydrogen production), and iii) models for primary energy supply.

International climate policy regimes8

The policy decision-support tool Framework to Assess International Regimes for the
differentiation of commitments (FAIR) has been developed to explore the environmental
and abatement cost implications of various international regimes and commitments for
meeting  long-term  climate  targets,  such  as  stabilisation  of  the  atmospheric  GHG
concentrations (den Elzen et al., 2005).

The FAIR model consists of three linked models:

■ A climate model: calculates the climate impacts of global emission profiles and emission
scenarios, and determines the global  emission reduction objective as the difference
between  the  baseline  emissions  scenario  and  a  global  emission  profile  for  a  given
climate policy.

■ An  emission  allocation  model:  calculates  the  regional  GHG  emission  allowances  for
different regimes to differentiate future commitments within the context of the global
reduction objective from the climate model. 

■ An abatement costs model: calculates the regional abatement costs and emission levels
after  trading,  on  the  basis  of  the  emission  allowances  coming  from  the  emission
allocation  model  following  a  least-cost  approach.  The  model  makes  full  use  of  the

ANNEX A. MODELLING FRAMEWORK

flexible Kyoto mechanisms as emissions trading and substitution of reductions between
the different gases and sources.

The model calculations are done at the level of 24/26 IMAGE world regions. The GHG
emissions of the six GHGs specified in the Kyoto Protocol are converted to carbon dioxide
equivalent  (see Chapter 3),  i.e. the  sum  of  the  global  warming  potential  weighted
emissions. Various data sets of historical emissions, baseline scenarios, emission profiles
and marginal abatement cost curves are included in the model framework to assess the
sensitivity of the outcomes to variation in these key inputs.

In recent years a range of extensions and enhancements have been implemented in
FAIR in accord with new proposals for global architectures for post-Kyoto agreements. In
particular  the  so-called  Copenhagen  pledges  are  implemented  and  analysed  for  their
expected  outcome,  recognising  the  uncertainties  contained  within  the  commitments
made by parties in their pledges (den Elzen et al., 2010).

Biodiversity

Terrestrial biodiversity9

The  GLOBIO  model,10  including  GLOBIO-aquatic,  was  used  to  calculate  changes  in
MSA (mean species abundance). The MSA indicator maps the compound effect of drivers
of biodiversity loss, and uses a suite of direct and indirect drivers provided by IMAGE in
conjunction  with  an  economic  model  LEITAP  (see Chapter 4).  The  compound  effect  on
biodiversity is computed with the GLOBIO3 model for terrestrial ecosystems (Alkemade et al.,
2009) (and recently also for freshwater systems; see below). In addition, the future pathway
of  direct  and  indirect  drivers  depends  on  a  variety  of  socio-economic  assumptions,
technological developments and policy assumptions, which are represented in the IMAGE
and GTAP. As the IMAGE and the GLOBIO3 are spatially explicit, the impacts on MSA can be
analysed by region, main biome and pressure factor.

GLOBIO3 takes into account the impacts of climate and land-use change, ecosystem
fragmentation, expansion of infrastructure such as roads and built-up areas, deposition of
acidity and reactive nitrogen.

For projections into the future, the underlying assumption is that higher pressures on
biodiversity  lead  to  lower  MSA.  The  GLOBIO3 model  contains  global  cause-effect
relationships  between  each  of  the  pressure  factors  considered  and  mean  species
abundance, based on more than 700 publications. These are applied in a spatially explicit
fashion,  namely  grid  cells  of  0.5 × 0.5  degree  longitude × latitude,  with  a  frequency
distribution representing the occurrence of various biomes within each cell. The effects of
the  considered  pressure  values  are  calculated  and  combined  per  grid  cell  to  obtain  an
overall MSA score. The MSA per region or for the world is the uniformly weighted sum over
the underlying grid cells. In other words, each square kilometre of every biome is weighted
as equal (ten Brink, 2000).

Aquatic (freshwater) biodiversity

The driving forces of pressures on inland aquatic ecosystems included in the current
version of GLOBIO are land-use changes in the catchment, eutrophication by phosphorus
and nitrogen, and flow changes due to water abstraction or river damming.

ANNEX A. MODELLING FRAMEWORK

Like  the  terrestrial  model,  the  cause-effect  relationships  are  based  on  a  review  of
existing data in the literature on species composition as a function of different degrees of
pressure (Weijters et al., 2009; Alkemade et al., 2011). Biodiversity was again expressed as
the  abundance  of  the  original  species  relative  to  the  pristine  state,  or  a  proxy  for  that.
Separate analyses were made for shallow and deep lakes (as a function of phosphorus and
nitrogen concentrations), wetlands (dependent on human land use) and rivers (dependent
on  both  human  land  use  and  deviation  from  the  natural  flow  regime).  The  effects  of
different pressures (if applicable) are assumed to be independent and hence multiplied. For
lakes, the probability of the occurrence of harmful algal blooms is also calculated.

Nutrients

The  Global  Nutrient  Model  describes  the  fate  of  nitrogen  (N)  and  phosphorus  (P)
emerging from more concentrated or point sources such as human settlements, and from
dispersed or non-point sources such as agricultural and natural land. Through rivers and
lakes, the remaining nutrient load eventually enters into coastal water bodies. Below, the
main steps involved with N are presented (and see Chapter 5 for more).

Point sources 

A conceptual relationship of per capita N emission and per-capita income was used to
calculate urban wastewater N discharge (modified from van Drecht et al., 2003; Bouwman
et al., 2005). The N emission is calculated as an annual mean per capita and country as a
function of food intake. Low-income countries have per capita N emissions of about 10g
per day and industrialised countries are between 15 g and 18 g per day.

The  amount  of  N  that  is  actually  discharged  to  surface  water  is  calculated  as  a
function of the N emission, the rate of removal in wastewater treatment plants (expressed
as a fraction of the N emission in raw wastewater), and the fraction of the total population
connected  to  public  sewerage  systems.  In  this  approach,  wastewater  N emissions  from
rural populations are excluded and coastal areas with direct discharge to the sea are not
accounted for.

Different types of wastewater treatment with varying removal rates are distinguished
for the removal of nitrogen: no treatment, mechanical, biological and advanced treatment;
see also the Annex to the Freshwater Chapter.

Non-point sources

Each IMAGE agricultural grid cell is divided into four aggregate agricultural land uses:
grassland, wetland rice, leguminous crops (pulses, soybeans) and other upland crops. The
annual surface nitrogen balance includes the nitrogen inputs and outputs for each land-
use  type.  Nitrogen  inputs  include  biological  nitrogen  fixation,  atmospheric  nitrogen
deposition, application of synthetic nitrogen fertiliser and animal manure. Outputs in the
surface nitrogen balance include nitrogen removal from the field by crop harvesting, hay
and grass-cutting, and grass consumption by grazing animals. The surplus of the surface
nitrogen  balance  is  calculated  from  these  components.  The  different  input  and  output
terms  of  the  surface  balance  are  discussed 
in  various  publications
(Bouwman et al., 2005, Bouwman et al., 2006 and Bouwman et al., 2011).

in  detail 

The groundwater flowing into draining surface water is a mixture of water flows with
varying  residence  times  in  the  groundwater  system.  The  nitrate  concentration  in

OECD ENVIRONMENTAL OUTLOOK TO 2050 © OECD 2012

ANNEX A. MODELLING FRAMEWORK

groundwater depends on the residence time of water infiltration into the saturated zone
and  the  denitrification  loss  during  its  transport.  Two  groundwater  subsystems  are
distinguished in the model: i) rapid transport of nitrate in surface run-off and flow through
shallow  groundwater  to  local  water  courses;  and  ii) slow  transport  through  deep
groundwater towards larger streams and rivers.

River nitrogen transport

The total nitrogen from point sources, direct atmospheric deposition and nitrate flows
from shallow and deep groundwater act as the input to the surface water within each grid
cell. In-stream metabolic processes remove nitrogen from the stream water by transferring
it to the biota, the atmosphere or stream sediments. A global river-export coefficient of 0.7
(implying retention and loss of 30% of the nitrogen discharged to streams and rivers) is
used, which represents a mean of a wide variety of river basins in Europe and the United
States (van Drecht et al., 2003).

AND DEVELOPMENT

The OECD is a unique forum where governments work together to address the economic, social and
environmental challenges of globalisation. The OECD is also at the forefront of efforts to understand and
to help governments respond to new developments and concerns, such as corporate governance, the
information economy and the challenges of an ageing population. The Organisation provides a setting
where governments can compare policy experiences, seek answers to common problems, identify good
practice and work to co-ordinate domestic and international policies.

The OECD member countries are: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Chile, the Czech Republic,
Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Korea,
Luxembourg, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, the Slovak Republic, Slovenia,
Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United States. The European Union takes
part in the work of the OECD.

OECD  Publishing  disseminates  widely  the  results  of  the  Organisation’s  statistics  gathering  and

OECD Environmental Outlook to 2050
THE CONSEQUENCES OF INACTION

Humanity has witnessed unprecedented growth and prosperity in the last four decades; the size of the world 
economy has more than tripled and the population has increased by over 3 billion people since 1970 to 7 billion 
today. This growth has, however, been accompanied by environmental pollution and natural resource depletion 
that could ultimately undermine human development. While protecting the environment and conserving 
natural resources remain key policy priorities, many countries are also struggling with slow economic growth, 
stretched public ﬁ nances and high levels of unemployment. Tackling these pressing challenges while coping 
with a population of over 9 billion projected for 2050 requires new, greener sources of growth.
The OECD Environmental Outlook to 2050 asks “What will the next four decades bring?”. Based on joint 
modelling by the OECD and the PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency, it looks towards 2050 
to envisage what demographic and economic trends might mean for the environment if the world does not 
adopt more ambitious green policies. It also looks as what policies could change that picture for the better. 
This Outlook focuses on the areas of climate change, biodiversity, water and health impacts of pollution, 
the four key environmental challenges identiﬁ ed in the OECD Environmental Outlook to 2030 (OECD, 2008) 
as“Red Light” issues requiring urgent attention.
