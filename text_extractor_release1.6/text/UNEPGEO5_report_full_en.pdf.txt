Foreword

Anyone wishing to understand the pace and scale of 
environmental change will find UNEP’s flagship assessment 
report – Global Environment Outlook-5: Environment for the 
future we want – compelling reading. Equally, anyone seeking 
a paradigm shift that can bring us closer to a truly sustainable 
world will find this latest edition of the GEO series rich in 
opportunities and policy options.  

GEO-5 is designed to be the most comprehensive, impartial and 
in-depth assessment of its kind. It reflects the collective body 
of recent scientific knowledge, drawing on the work of leading 
experts, partner institutions and the vast body of research 
undertaken within and beyond the United Nations system.  

The launch of GEO-5 coincides with the final stages of preparation 
for the UN Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20), taking 
place two decades after the Rio Earth Summit that set the agenda for 
contemporary thinking about sustainable development. The report 
underlines the reasons why world leaders need to show decisive 
leadership in Rio and beyond. It highlights the state, trends and 
trajectories of the planet and its people, and showcases more than 
100 initiatives, projects and policies from across the globe that are 
pioneering positive environmental change. 

In a world with a growing population, glaring inequality 
and a precarious environmental base, it is imperative that 
Governments collaborate to balance the economic, social and 
environmental strands of sustainable development. GEO-5 
highlights not just the perils of delaying action, but the options 
that exist to transform sustainable development from theory 
to reality. I commend GEO-5 to all who wish to invest in this 
generational opportunity to create the future we want.

Foreword

Preface

Since the days of the ancient Egyptians, Greeks and Chinese, 
through the Islamic Golden Age and the Renaissance, 
philosophers and scientists have sought to make sense of the 
forces and processes of the natural world and humanity’s place 
within them. In the past half century or so, this endeavour has 
accelerated as concerns over the impacts of industrialization 
have emerged and more recently been fuelled by a growing 
realization that people – once marginal influencers of 
environmental change – are now its principal drivers, from 
biodiversity loss to climate change.

The Global Environment Outlook: Environment for the future we 
want (GEO-5) is part of this broad sweep of history, and is a major 
contribution to the public understanding of the way ecosystems 
and the atmosphere are responding to patterns of unprecedented 
consumption and production – patterns taking place on a planet of 
7 billion people, rising to more than 9 billion by 2050. Its findings 
on the state of the planet, globally and regionally, are unsurprisingly 
sobering and cause for profound concern – they should serve as 
a reminder to world leaders and delegates attending the Rio+20 
Summit in June as to why they are there.

Bridging the science-policy interface remains problematic – 
translating the findings of science into environmental law and 
policy making has been a challenge stretching back through Rio 
1992 to the Stockholm Conference on the Human Environment 
of 1972. Encouragingly, a growing scientific understanding and 
technological progress have not fallen on deaf ears; they have 
inspired a myriad of treaties and agreements covering such 
issues as the trade in endangered species, the protection of the 
ozone layer, climate change, biodiversity loss and the banning of 
persistent organic pollutants. 

GEO-5 adds new dimensions to the discourse through its 
assessment of progress towards meeting internationally agreed 
goals and identifying gaps in their achievement. Out of 90 goals 
and objectives assessed, significant progress could only be shown 
for four. Of equal concern, progress could not be appraised for 14 
goals and objectives simply because data were lacking. 

Another GEO-5 innovation is that it highlights a regional selection 
of more than a hundred policies and transformational actions 
that have been tried and tested successfully in countries and 
communities around the world. These policy options give decision 
makers tools that could be adapted to their own settings. 

Such policy options are part of a broad sweep of emerging work 
termed the Green Economy, which in the context of sustainable 
development and poverty eradication is one of the two major 

themes for Rio+20. The summit is about taking stock and 
renewing commitments, but it is also about the integration of 
scientific findings in evidence-based policy making and the  
re-engagement of society in endeavours to move the world on  
to a sustainable path.

When nations take stock of sustainable development 20 years 
after the Rio Earth Summit of 1992, the limited achievements and 
endemic knowledge divide between North and South should be 
high on the agenda.

In summary, science must underpin policy making, but as five 
GEO assessments and reports have shown, it is not enough. 
Realizing and implementing science-based policies is where the 
real gap resides, and this can be bridged not by more satellite 
observations, field monitoring, computations and scenario 
modeling but by courage, decisiveness and political leadership 
that matches the reality that GEO-5 confirms.

Introduction

THE EARTH SYSTEM CONTEXT
The Earth System provides the basis for all human societies 
and their economic activities. People need clean air to breathe, 
safe water to drink, healthy food to eat, energy to produce and 
transport goods, and natural resources that provide the raw 
materials for all these services. However, the 7 billion humans 
alive today are collectively exploiting the Earth’s resources at 
accelerating rates and intensities that surpass the capacity of its 
systems to absorb wastes and neutralize the adverse effects on 
the environment. In fact, the depletion or degradation of several 
key resources has already constrained conventional development 
in some parts of the world.

Within the Earth System – which acts as a single, self-regulating 
system comprised of physical, chemical, biological and human 
components – the effects of human activities can be detected 
at a planetary scale (Chapter 7). These have led scientists to 
define a new geological epoch, the Anthropocene, based on 
evidence that atmospheric, geological, hydrological, biological 
and other Earth System processes are being altered by human 
activity. The most readily recognized changes include a rise in 
global temperatures and sea levels, and ocean acidification, all 
associated with the increase in emissions of greenhouse gases, 
especially carbon dioxide and methane (Chapters 2 and 4). Other 
human-induced changes include extensive deforestation and 
land clearance for agriculture and urbanization, causing species 
extinctions as natural habitats are destroyed (Chapters 3 and 5). 

While humans have long been aware of the effects of their 
activities on the local environment, only in the last few 
decades has it become apparent that these activities can 
cumulatively affect the global environment (Chapters 1–7). In 
the past, anthropogenic pressures on natural resources were 
less pervasive and the Earth’s atmosphere, land and water 
could carry the load of human consumption and production. 
However, in the second half of the 20th century the effects of 
many diverse local changes compounded at accelerating rates 
to produce global consequences. Globalization allows goods 
to be produced under circumstances that consumers would 
refuse to tolerate in their own community, and permits waste 
to be exported out of sight, enabling people to ignore both its 
magnitude and its impacts. However, just as waste has – literally 
– reached the ends of the Earth, environmental concerns have 
become globalized as well (Chapter 1). 

These threats to the Earth System have led the science 
community and policy makers to work together more closely to 
meet the challenge in a sustainable and collaborative manner.

THE SCIENCE-POLICY CONTEXT 
At the 1972 United Nations Conference on the Human 
Environment, 119 nations came together for the first time 
to discuss serious environmental concerns raised by the 

xviii

Introduction

scientific and conservation communities. As an initial step, 
the conference established UNEP to catalyse international 
and UN-wide environmental action. Twenty years on, the 
United Nations Conference on Environment and Development 
in Rio de Janeiro approved Agenda 21, a blueprint for the 
introduction of sustainable development, a concept first 
articulated as “satisfying the needs of the present generation 
without compromising the chance for future generations to 
satisfy theirs” in the World Commission on Environment and 
Development 1987 report Our Common Future. In the second 
decade of the new century, Agenda 21 remains a vibrant and 
relevant guide with many of its precepts yet to be applied, 
particularly in regard to consumption.

The 2000 Millennium Summit, which brought world leaders 
together to discuss the role of the United Nations at the turn of 
the 21st century, produced eight Millennium Development Goals 
(MDGs) to make up for shortcomings that resulted from a focus 
on economic objectives while international development stalled. 
The MDGs address the integration of sustainable development 
principles into country policies and programmes and aim to 
reverse the impoverishment of human and environmental 
resources, while setting time-bound targets and establishing 
metrics. MDG 7, which specifically addresses the environment, set 
targets to make significant reductions in the rate of biodiversity 
loss by 2010, to halve the proportion of the population without 
sustainable access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation by 
2015, and to achieve a significant improvement in the lives of at 
least 100 million slum dwellers by 2020. 

As understanding has developed about the relationship between 
human well-being and environmental change, so have the 
attempts to make it relevant for policy makers. The dependence 
of social development and economic activity on environmental 
services and stability is increasingly understood. An economy 
functions within a society, or within and between societies, using 
natural and human resources to produce marketable goods and 
services. At the same time, societies survive and thrive within the 
environment determined by the physical limits of atmosphere, 
land, water, biodiversity and other material resources. 

Interacting environmental, social and economic forces produce 
a complex system that has been the focus of substantial 
research, but it is only in the last two decades that information 
and communication technologies have enabled researchers  
to model and explore the intricate complexities of the whole 
Earth System. 

Insights gained from the ability to appreciate the power and 
nuance of Earth System complexities demand a new perception 
of the responsibilities and accountabilities of nation states 
towards planetary stewardship (Chapter 16 and 17). This not 
only requires the realization of environment and development 

goals and targets but also the development of specific goals 
aimed at global sustainability, addressing the needs of the most 
vulnerable as well as the wants of the more powerful.

The elaboration of such goals requires scientifically credible 
indicators and information to guide, track and report progress 
(Chapter 8). Integrated environmental assessments are tools, within 
a broad and deep toolkit, that have been developed to meet this 
need. However, for the most part, policy developments and revisions 
have failed to adequately incorporate assessment findings and 
other scientific information into international policy priorities.

BACKGROUND
The main goal of UNEP’s Global Environment Outlook (GEO) is to 
keep governments and stakeholders informed of the state and 
trends of the global environment. Over the past 15 years, the 
GEO reports have examined a wealth of data, information and 
knowledge about the global environment; identified potential 
policy responses; and provided an outlook for the future. The 
assessments, and their consultative and collaborative processes, 
have worked to bridge the gap between science and policy by 
turning the best available scientific knowledge into information 
relevant for decision makers.

Previous GEO reports focused on an analysis of environmental 
issues and the identification of responses, using an integrated 
approach that provided a comprehensive and multidisciplinary 
overview across different themes. This fifth Global Environment 
Outlook (GEO-5) builds on previous reports, continuing to provide 
analyses of the state, trends and outlook for, and responses to, 
environmental change. But it also adds new dimensions through 
its assessment of progress towards meeting internationally 
agreed goals and identifying gaps in their achievement 
(Chapters 2–6), on analysing promising response options that 
have emerged in the regions (Chapters 9–15), and presenting 
potential responses for the international community (Chapters 
16–17). Furthermore, for the first time, GEO-5 suggests that there 
should be a fundamental shift in the way environmental issues 
are analysed, with consideration given to the drivers of global 
change, rather than merely to the pressures on the environment. 

Details of the process followed by the UNEP Secretariat in 
developing GEO-5, including the assemblage of more than 
600 scientists guided by governmental, scientific and policy 
advisory bodies, are presented in the GEO-5 Process section.

STRUCTURE
The GEO-5 report is made up of 17 chapters organized into three 
distinct but linked parts.

overarching socio-economic forces that exert varying degrees of 
influence, or pressures, on the environment. Chapter 1 identifies 
and describes these major root causes of the environmental 
challenges and provides some suggestions for policy 
interventions. 

Using the drivers, pressures, state, impacts and responses 
(DPSIR) analytical framework (Figure 1), the GEO-5 assessment 
presents the latest state and trends of the global environment 
under the themes of atmosphere, land, water, biodiversity 
and, for the first time in the GEO series, chemicals and waste 
(Chapters 2–6).

The DPSIR framework is used to identify and evaluate the 
complex and multidimensional cause-and-effect relationships 
between society and the environment. The DPSIR framework 
used in GEO assessments is an extension of the pressure-state-
response model developed by the OECD and the European 
Environment Agency in the mid-1990s. Drivers such as population 
dynamics, economic demand and unsustainable consumption 
and production patterns are processes that lead to impacts on 
the environment. These drivers often directly or indirectly result 
in environmental pressures including increased emissions of 
pollutants and wastes and destructive resource extraction. Such 
pressures cause changes to the environment with concomitant 
impacts on both humans and ecosystems. The DPSIR analytical 
framework helps to identify these processes. Finally, it suggests 
responses, which can take many forms at many scales from 
community action to international treaties, not only to the 
underlying drivers, but also to the environmental pressures and 
their impacts on ecosystems and human health.

Chapters 2–6 evaluate whether a selection of internationally 
agreed environmental goals are being met for each of the 
themes; Chapter 7 provides a synthesis of the thematic 
information from an Earth System perspective. Part 1 concludes 
with a review of the need to strengthen the collection, analysis 
and interpretation of data relevant to tracking the state and 
trends of the environment as a fundamental requirement for 
further research, for monitoring and evaluation, for scientific 
assessments, and for effective policy making (Chapter 8). 

Part 2 – Policy options from the regions
Part 2 of GEO-5, Chapters 9–14, presents an appraisal of 
policy options from the regions (Figure 2) that show potential 
for helping to speed up the accomplishment of internationally 
agreed goals. This was requested by UNEP’s Governing Council 
and provides readers wishing to implement successful policies 
with promising avenues for exploration. 

Part 1 – State and trends of the global environment
To explore today’s rapidly changing socio-economic conditions, 
Chapter 1 examines the drivers of environmental change – the 

To direct the policy appraisal, multi-stakeholder consultations 
were undertaken in each region to identify priority environmental 
challenges and related internationally agreed goals. 

Introduction xix

Following a screening exercise, policies or policy clusters that either 
demonstrated a record of success with respect to their associated 
goals or featured innovative characteristics combined with 
promising initial results were retained and analysed in further 
detail. The policy appraisal was based on literature review, 
documented case studies and expert opinion. It was not always 

possible to apply a consistent appraisal methodology due to 
the multi-faceted and non-quantifiable elements of some of 
the internationally agreed goals and the multi-dimensional and 
cross-cutting nature of the co-benefits and trade-offs of the 
policies. Consistency of approach was also hampered by a lack  
of underlying data and indicators.

The appraisal explored the benefits of the policies and the enabling 
conditions that facilitated their adoption or success. Other 
characteristics that were analysed include the monitoring and 
tracking of environmental, economic or social outcomes; cross-
cutting effects on other priority themes and internationally agreed 
goals; and the potential for their application in new contexts. 

Each region identified policy responses that were effective and 
potentially suitable for replication and/or adoption in other 
countries. Some highly promising approaches featured in the 
regional chapters are worthy of closer analysis and possible 
testing by governments.

The regional summary at the end of Part 2 (Chapter 15) presents 
an overview of the priority environmental challenges selected 
by the regions; a discussion on commonalities, challenges, and 
opportunities; and a summary of the policy options. 

Part 3 – Opportunities for a global response
The final part of GEO-5 begins with an analysis of the type of actions 
required to reach a sustainable world. It first reviews existing 
environmental treaties and internationally agreed goals to construct 
a possible vision for 2050 with specific goals and targets. Next, 
existing scenario studies are reviewed in the context of two possible 
categories: conventional world scenarios that depict possible 
development if present trends continue and, second, global 
scenarios that aim to achieve a sustainable world. The analysis that 
follows identifies a range of measures that could enable the world 
to reach the sustainable development targets identified by GEO-5. 
Achieving these targets, however, requires radical departure from 
current trends. To account for the interactions of policies across 
sectors in the dense and interlinked system of global activities, an 

integrated sustainable world scenario is included in the analysis 
to examine the extent and complexity of policy changes needed to 
achieve the vision for 2050 (Chapter 16). 

Chapters 16 and 17 review the state of knowledge of how public 
institutions, the private sector and civil society could generate 
effective and efficient responses to environmental change. While 
many responses at national and regional levels have successfully 
put societies on trajectories that are beginning to address some of 
these challenges, the analysis confirms that global environmental 
change cannot be addressed successfully by any single approach. 

GEO-5 concludes by identifying action to undertake at the global 
level, combined with relevant national applications where 
appropriate, to enable the adoption of truly transformative 
policies – as well as the legal, institutional and policy frameworks 
required to make them successful. GEO-5 will provide the reader 
not only with an understanding of the complexity of the threats 
humanity faces, but possible policy solutions and transformative 
pathways to a sustainable future.

The GEO-5 process contributes to UNEP’s mission of providing 
leadership and encouraging partnership in caring for the 
environment by inspiring, informing, and enabling nations and 
peoples to improve their quality of life without compromising 
that of future generations. To facilitate its development the Earth 
was divided into regions which largely reflect the concerns and 
remits of the six UNEP’s Regional Offices, and allowed them to 
provide regional support to the working teams preparing GEO-5. 
A full breakdown of the regions, sub-regions and their respective 
nation states can be found on the Environmental Data Explorer

Drivers 3

Main Messages 

The scale, spread and rate of change of global  
drivers are without precedent. Burgeoning 
populations and growing economies are pushing 
environmental systems to destabilizing limits. The 
idea that the perturbation of a complex ecological 
system can trigger sudden feedbacks is not new: 
significant scientific research has explored thresholds 
and tipping points that the planetary system may 
face if humanity does not control carbon emissions. 
Understanding feedbacks from the perspective 
of drivers reveals that many of them interact in 
unpredictable ways. Generally, the rates of change in 
these drivers are not monitored or managed, and so it 
is not possible to predict or even perceive dangerous 
thresholds as they approach. Critically, the bulk of 
research has been on understanding the effects of 
drivers on ecosystems, not on the effects of changed 
ecosystems on the drivers – the feedback loop.

Patterns of globalization – links between trade, 
finance, technology and communication – have made 
it possible for trends in drivers to generate intense 
pressures in concentrated parts of the world very 
quickly. There has been a rapid rise in the production 
of biomass-based fuels for transport – from maize, 
sugar cane, palm oil and rapeseed. In the early years 
of the 21st century, biodiesel became more widely 
available, with production growing at around 60 per 
cent per year, reaching nearly 13 million tonnes of 
oil equivalent in 2009. However, recent information 
raises concerns about the direct environmental 
and social consequences of large-scale biofuel 
production. These complex issues include, but are 
not limited to, land clearance and conversion, the 
introduction of potentially invasive species, the 
overuse of water, effects on the global food market, 
and the purchase or leasing of land by foreign 
investors to produce food and biofuels, typically in 
developing and sometimes semi-arid countries.

Drivers typically have high inertia and path 
dependencies, which can act as barriers to effective 

action. Three-quarters of the agricultural land in the 
United States is dedicated to just eight commodity 
crops: maize, wheat, cotton, soybeans, rice, barley, 
oats and sorghum. This dominance is reinforced by 
a set of interlocking structural constraints including 
high levels of producer subsidies, dietary preferences, 
and a large industrialized food processing 
economy. For example, of the top 20 sources of 
industrial pollution in the United States, eight are 
slaughterhouses, but even with well-understood 
environmental and health problems associated with 
this food system, its highly entrenched nature makes 
it extremely difficult to modify.

Although reducing the drivers of environmental 
change directly may appear politically difficult, it 
is possible to accomplish some environmental co-
benefits by targeting more expedient objectives, 
such as international goals on human well-being. 
Education is recognized as a basic human right, 
included in the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights. Achieving universal primary education is 
Goal 2 of the Millennium Development Goals, and it 
is linked to the improvement of gender equality and 
women’s empowerment. Together with access to 
reproductive health, education is a key determinant 
of fertility levels. Greater investment in education 
has been correlated with declining fertility, rising 
incomes and increasing longevity, and also with an 
educated citizenry able to express concern about 
environmental matters.

Surveillance and monitoring get results. Even where 
policy responses are not immediately possible, 
awareness of the importance of drivers can justify 
increased efforts at surveillance and monitoring. 
Many of the most important drivers identified in 
this chapter are currently not subject to systematic 
monitoring, their impacts even less so. The evidence, 
then, is compelling for the need to enhance the 
understanding and monitoring of drivers and their 
links with the environment.

INTRODUCTION
The last 100 years was characterized by exceptional growth both 
in the human population and in the size of the global economy, 
with the population quadrupling to 7 billion and global economic 
output, expressed as gross domestic product (GDP), increasing 
about 20-fold (Maddison 2009). This expansion has been 
accompanied by fundamental changes in the scale, intensity and 
character of society’s relationship with the natural world (Steffen 
et al. 2007; MA 2005; McNeill 2000). In tracking and analysing 
these transformations, a new understanding of the complexities 
of the Earth’s biophysical systems has been developed.

It is four decades since Lovelock (1972) introduced the idea 
that the Earth’s systems were a complex organism. More 
recently, science has struggled with the realization that many 
Earth systems are at planetary boundaries that must not be 
crossed (Rockström et al. 2009). These concepts are useful to 
communicate both the dependence of human development on 
the environment and the urgency with which the consequences 
of collective human activity on the biological, physical and 
chemical processes of the Earth’s systems need to be addressed. 
The impacts of human activities include alteration of the 
global carbon cycle by carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) 
emissions; disruption of the nitrogen, phosphorous and sulphur 
cycles; interruptions in natural river flows that interfere with 
the water cycle; destruction of ecosystems that has led to the 
extinction of countless species; and drastic modification of the 
planet’s land cover (Rockström et al. 2009). 

FRAMEWORK
The fifth Global Environment Outlook (GEO-5) is organized using 
the DPSIR framework consisting of drivers, pressures, states, 
impacts and responses along a continuum (Stanners et al. 2007). 
Drivers refer to the overarching socio-economic forces that exert 
pressures on the state of the environment. While GEO-4 identified 
drivers within a thematic context, GEO-5 identifies two major 
drivers on the continuum – population and economic development 
– that influence cross-cutting dynamic patterns and generate 
complex systemic interactions. For example, the pressure of 
supplying food, feed and fibre to growing urban centres threatens 
biodiversity, a pressure then exacerbated by climate change.

Pressures can include resource extraction, land-use change and 
the modification and movement of organisms. For example, 
as economic growth and the demand for agricultural products 
rise, so does the conversion of land for agricultural purposes, 
as well as the use of agrochemicals. Similarly, market demands, 
trade and globalization patterns can lead to the inadvertent 
transport of invasive species that may wreak havoc on the natural 
ecosystems they newly inhabit.

The DPSIR framework asks three questions (Pinter et al. 1999): 
•	 What	is	happening	to	the	environment	and	why	(pressure	and	

state)?

•	 What	is	the	consequence	of	the	changed	environment	(impact)?
•	 If	appropriate,	what	is	being	done	about	it	and	how	effective	

is it (response)?

Questions regarding the role of drivers behind pressures – 
and the relationship between the two – can lead to persistent 
theoretical discussions. GEO-5 assumes that such roles and 
relationships are fluid, sometimes arbitrary, a stance that should 
serve the purposes of this assessment. 

To facilitate policy-making, this report considers leverage 
points to be advantageous places to intervene in the complex 
human interaction with the Earth System (Meadows 1999). In 
many cases, the most important leverage points for policy may 
not be the pressures themselves but the drivers. There can be 
substantial co-benefits, and trade-offs, associated with altering 
drivers in order to reduce pressure on the environment. 

To effectively describe the selected drivers and for a better 
understanding of the pressures acting on the environment, two 
questions are asked that focus on why environmental changes 
are occurring or, more fundamentally, why there is pressure. 
•	 What	is	the	scale	or	quantity	of	the	driver?	This	entails	both	

the size of the driver and its growth rate, as well as the extent 
of its influence and effect on other parameters. 

•	 What	is	the	intensity	or	quality	of	the	driver?	This	entails	the	
organization of the driver as well as the various processes it 
exhibits and influences. 

DRIVERS
Population growth and economic development are seen as 
ubiquitous drivers of environmental change with particular 
facets exerting pressure: energy, transport, urbanization and 
globalization. While this list may not be exhaustive, it is useful. 
Understanding the growth in these drivers and the connections 
between them will go a long way to address their collective impact 
and find possible solutions, thereby preserving the environmental 
benefits on which human societies and economies depend.

Population 
Many environmental pressures are proportional to the number of 
people dependent on natural resources, although technological 
advances can mitigate individual impacts. When a population of 
deer, rats or sea urchins grows beyond the carrying capacity of their 
ecosystem, their populations crash. Sometimes the ecosystem 
recovers but sometimes it is permanently altered. This has been 
happening to human populations for millennia as they grow 
beyond the capacity of their valley, island or landscape to support 
their society, and they face famine, plague or collapse (Diamond 
2005). In the last century, as human numbers grew, people came 
to exploit most of Earth’s surface, but it is not only the scale or 
quantity of the population that affects the nature of a pressure 
on the environment. In addition, how human populations are 
organized – in cities or villages, in nuclear or extended families, 
as migrants or those that stay behind – makes a difference to the 
capacity of the environment to support them in their way of life.

Quantity
The human population reached 7 billion in 2011 and is expected 
to reach 10 billion by 2100 (UN 2011). Using the regions defined 
by the UN Statistics Division, the Asia and Oceania region has 

Drivers 5

the largest population, Africa is the fastest-growing and most 
youthful region, and Europe and North America have the slowest-
growing populations and the highest proportion of elderly. As 
of 2012, much of the current growth in global population can 
be attributed to momentum left from past population increases, 
shifts in generational composition, and communities with high 
fertility rates in rural areas of less developed countries and 
elsewhere (Bongaarts and Bulatao 1999). Population momentum 
explains the apparent contradiction between a growing 
population size and declining fertility rates. Higher fertility rates 
in previous decades have resulted in a large generation of youth 
now entering or in the reproductive age group. This increase in 
the reproducing population creates conditions for larger numbers 
of births overall, even though couples are having fewer children.

Fertility is declining in almost all countries, although rates vary 
broadly. At the global level, the crude birth rate fell from 37 births 
per thousand in 1950–1955 to 20 per thousand in 2005–2010, 
while total fertility, or the number of children per woman, 
declined from 4.9 in 1950–1955 to 2.6 in 2005–2010 (UN 2011). 
While the fertility decline was more accentuated in developing 
countries – from 6.0 to 2.7 children per woman between 1950 
and 2010 – fertility levels in the countries of the less developed 
regions are still spread over a broad range. Among developed 
countries, fertility levels were already relatively low in 1950 at 
2.8 children per woman, but continued to fall to 1.6 children per 
woman in 2010, which is less than the replacement rate of 2.1 
children per woman (Box 1.1) (UN 2011). Although the global 
growth rate peaked more than 40 years ago, some estimates 
suggest there will be another billion people by 2025 and a further 
billion before mid-century (UN 2009a). 

Fertility and mortality are closely linked. Fewer pregnancies, for 
example, translate into a reduction in maternal mortality, which 
in many countries is still a leading cause of death for women of 
childbearing age. Further, lower infant and child mortality may lead 
to lower fertility rates as parents become better able to depend on 
their children surviving (Palloni and Rafalimanana 1999). 

The epidemiological transition closely mirrors the fertility aspect 
of the demographic transition. In regions that are in an early 
demographic stage – those with high birth and death rates – 
death clusters around infants, whose deaths are mostly related 
to nutritional deficiencies, and those dying of communicable 
diseases such as influenza, malaria, tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS. 
In regions that have entered a later demographic stage – those 
with lower birth and death rates – infant mortality is low and 
deaths coalesce around the elderly and are associated with 
obesity and aging, with many deaths due to cancer and heart 
disease (Murray and Lopez 1997). 

Mortality transitions remain distinct between developed and 
developing countries, despite improvements. Infant mortality has 
continued to decline and life expectancy to rise everywhere. Global 
average life expectancy in 1950–1955 was 47 years, while in 2005–
2010 it was 65–68 for men and 70 for women (UN 2009a). There 
are, of course, important regional variations, particularly in terms 
of infant mortality in the least developed countries, young adult 
mortality in countries affected by the HIV epidemic, and old-age 
mortality in developed countries (de Sherbinin et al. 2007; Rindfuss 
and Adamo 2004). Table 1.1 shows notable disparities in mortality 
rates. Infant mortality rates vary from 74 deaths per 1 000 live births 
in Africa to 6 deaths per 1 000 in Europe and North America.

Box 1.1 Facilitating the demographic transition through education

Population levels and growth rates are not subject to 
international goals and targets, although population is directly 
relevant to major policy areas, including the Millennium 
Development Goals (MDGs). The most cost-effective method 
of reducing population pressures is through meeting the 
demand for contraception: many countries formulate policy 
targets around meeting unmet demand while increasing 
demand through investing in education for girls. Given that 
approximately 40 per cent of pregnancies remain unintended, 
great potential exists to meet latent demand for contraception 
(Singh et al. 2010).

In developing countries, girls’ education is critical not only for 
reducing fertility, but for the associated lower mortality rates 
and improvements in health (Lutz and Samir 2011). Between 
1970 and 2009, more than half of the deaths prevented among 
children under the age of five could be attributed to increased 
women’s education during their reproductive age (Gakidou 
et al. 2010). In addition, women have been better equipped 
to resist violence by gaining greater socio-economic standing 
through education. This empowerment has, for example, 
helped women avoid HIV/AIDS infection (Bhana et al. 2009; 
Vyas and Watts 2009). 

Education is recognized as a basic human right included in 
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UNDHR 1948). 
Achieving universal primary education is MDG 2, linked to the 
improvement of gender equality and women’s empowerment 
(UN 2000). Together with access to reproductive health 
(MDG 5b), education is a key determinant of fertility levels. 
Increasing investment in education has been correlated with 
declining fertility, rising incomes and greater longevity (Bulled 
and Sosis 2010), and an educated human population is also 
able to express greater concern about environmental matters 
(White and Hunter 2009). 

Great opportunities exist for positive interventions in education. 
An ethical imperative and a social and economic good, universal 
education for girls would also empower them to make their 
own choices concerning starting and expanding their families. 
Globally, girls represent 60 per cent of the 77 million children 
not attending primary school (CARE 2011). To achieve the MDG 
of universal primary school enrolment by 2015 it is estimated 
that an additional US$10–30 billion per year needs to be 
invested on top of the approximately US$80 billion currently 
spent annually on primary education (Bruns et al. 2003; 
Devarajan et al. 2002).

Migration is another component of the demographic transition 
and is characterized by shifts from predominantly rural-
rural migration in regions at early stages of the transition, 
to rural-urban and international migration in regions at later 
stages. The most dynamic of the three population processes, 
population movements produce local and global environmental 
consequences. Migration may have any of three direct impacts 
on the environment:
•		rural-rural	migration	produces	direct	household	impacts	on	

natural resources, often through agricultural expansion; 

•		rural-urban	migration	and	associated	livelihood	changes	are	
often accompanied by changing patterns of energy use and 
increased meat and dairy consumption, which can intensify 
land pressures in productive rural areas; and 

•		international	migration,	with	remittances	sent	home,	can	
have a direct impact through land-use investments or an 
indirect impact through increased meat, dairy and material 
consumption. 

Africa is increasingly urbanizing, although most of the population 
remains rural; Asia and Oceania and Latin America and the 
Caribbean are already largely urbanized and migration streams 
are increasingly international; and the United States and Europe 
have high internal migration associated with labour mobility 
(UNDESA 2011; Zaiceva and Zimmerman 2008).
 
The sending and receiving areas of rural-urban and 
international migration remain connected through remittances, 

with specific characteristics varying considerably across 
regions. The potential remittance-driven impact on land use 
change is significant, while remittance-driven consumption may 
be similar in scale but more diffuse in its environmental impacts 
(World Bank 2011b).

Internal migration is increasingly dominated by rural-urban flows, 
a trend that is expected to continue (Sommers 2010; Rindfuss 
and Adamo 2004; Cohen and Small 1998). However, in some 
developing countries, a minority of rural-rural migrants has a 
disproportionate impact on tropical deforestation (Carr 2009; 
Lambin et al. 2003). Increasing migration to coastal areas and 
small islands can affect the environmental integrity of coastal 
wetlands and associated fisheries (Rindfuss and Adamo 2004). 

such as fertility, mortality and migration, and the fact that some 
locations are simply less suitable for human occupation (Adamo 
and de Sherbinin 2011). Population is particularly concentrated 
at lower elevations and near coasts. An estimate from 1998 
suggested that a zone below an altitude of 100 metres, 
comprising 15 per cent of all inhabited land, houses about 
30 per cent of the human population (Cohen and Small 1998). 
Low-elevation coastal zones are even more concentrated, 
representing about 2 per cent of total land area but housing 
13 per cent of the population, and growing rapidly (McGranahan 
et al. 2007). 

In 1950 only 29 per cent of the world population lived in urban 
settings and only New York and Tokyo, with their populations of 
more than 10 million people, qualified as megacities. The urban 
proportion reached 50 per cent in 2010 with 20 megacities, 
with the bulk of the urban population in Asia and Latin America 
(Figure 1.2). Urban growth rates are high in both Asia and Africa 
(Satterthwaite et al. 2010), with the highest rates in recent 
decades in middle-sized cities (Montgomery 2008). 

Quality
Beyond the size and growth rates of populations, the way 
people settle and the way they consume can result in effects 
on different ecosystems. 

While all of the world’s net population growth by 2050 is projected 
to occur in the world’s poorest cities (UN 2009b), virtually all land-
cover change will take place in rural environments. The greatest 
human imprint on the Earth’s surface has been the conversion of 
forest to agriculture. Currently, 37.4 per cent of the planet’s land 
surface is used for agricultural production (Foley et al. 2011). 

World population is unevenly distributed, with densities in 2010 
varying from 21 000 people per km2 in Macao to 0.03 per km2
in Greenland. This is due to a number of factors including 
settlement history, regional variations in demographic dynamics 

Located on only 0.5 per cent of the global terrestrial surface 
(Schneider et al. 2009), urban areas’ demand for food is 
disproportionately large in terms of world land use. At 
the same time, forest loss is no longer correlated to rural

population growth; rather at the national scale, it is linked to 
the international demand for agricultural products and timber 
harvesting for urban consumption (DeFries et al. 2010). 

The world is nearly evenly divided between rural and urban 
inhabitants. One half includes rural food producers with 
a direct impact on land in space and time. Their effect on 
forests is particularly acute and widespread following rural-
rural migration and the associated conversion of forests to 
agricultural land. This very small minority of all migrants is 
responsible for a significant proportion of tropical deforestation 
yet remains very little researched (Carr 2009). From a drivers 
perspective, it is also much more difficult to manage this 
phenomenon due to the scale and diffuse nature of the activity. 
The second type is the burgeoning urban population who are 
concentrated in space but whose impacts on the land are 
indirect albeit significant.

A rising human population has also been identified as the 
principal root cause of the water crisis (UNEP 2006). Overall, 
humans use more than a quarter of terrestrial evapotranspiration 
for growing crops and more than half of accessible water run-off 
(Postel et al. 1996). While climate change is making some places 
wetter (Clark and Aide 2011), much of Africa and the Middle 
East currently suffer a water scarcity that is worsening with the 
expanding populations (Sowers et al. 2010). Population growth 
has also been implicated in water scarcity in rapidly developing 
countries such as China, where urban growth has exacerbated 
a decline in the availability of clean water by overwhelming 
the water supply and sanitation infrastructure (Jiang 2009). 

Population is not the only problem: groundwater use is highly 
inequitable, for example in India where 10 per cent of large 
farms consume 90 per cent of groundwater (Aguilar 2011;  
Kumar et al. 1998). Nor is a thirsty populace the only outcome. 
In the Republic of Tanzania, a diverse series of drivers, including 
population growth, has led to water conflicts (Mbonile 2005). 
Water scarcity can also provoke migration, as documented 
throughout Africa (Mwang’ombe et al. 2011; Grote and Warner 
2010; Mbonile 2005).

Addressing population as a driver of global environmental 
change, households can be considered as units for analysing 
consumption patterns (Jiang and Hardee 2009; UNFPA 2008; 
Liu et al. 2003; MacKellar et al. 1995). In the developed world, 
household size is shrinking as their composition changes 
from extended families to nuclear ones (Bongaarts 2001). 
As a consequence, the rise in the number of households 
has been faster than population growth (Liu et al. 2003). 
Research suggests that this can cause double the rise in energy 
consumption that would occur from population growth alone 
(MacKellar et al. 1995), as there is an increase in the number 
of appliances and the level of electricity consumed per person 
(Zhou et al. 2011). Larger households generally use less energy 
per person than small ones, conforming to the expectations of 
economies of scale (O’Neill et al. 2001; Ironmonger et al. 1995). 
The age composition of a household also has an impact on 
energy consumption, Lenzen et al. (2006), working with data 
from Australia, Brazil, Denmark, India and Japan, found that 
the residents’ average age is positively related with per-person 
energy consumption, while household size and urban location 

Drivers 9

are negatively associated. Transport, too, is likely to be more 
sensitive to the number of households, since an increase in 
the number of homes occurs primarily in low-density suburban 
landscapes (Seto et al. 2010), resulting in more passenger 
vehicles and more commuting, which add to petrol consumption 
and pollution. 

Beyond the household unit, studies also identify impacts 
associated with absolute population size. A study of Californian 
counties found that population size significantly contributes 
to increases in nitrogen oxide and carbon monoxide emissions 
(Cramer 1998). Similarly, researchers have observed a positive 
relationship between population size and CO2 emissions (Cole 
and Neumayer 2004; Mackellar et al. 1995; Bongaarts 1992), 
with an inverted U-shaped curve relation for sulphur dioxide 
(Cole and Neumayer 2004). How households and populations 
impact ecosystems is highly dependent on the stage of 
development, the geographic scale and the ecosystem itself, 
which is discussed further in Chapters 2–6.

Economic development 
Consumption and production are both components of 
economic development and, like population, have a multiplier 
effect on environmental pressures. While consumption and 
production are technically separate socio-economic drivers, 
they are so inextricably linked that it is difficult to discuss them 
independently: the consumption of raw materials by the primary 
industries of mining and forestry leads to the manufacture of 
products that are in turn consumed by individual customers.

Quantity
The production of goods for consumption requires materials 
– minerals, water, food, fibre – and energy. During the 20th 
century, global economic output grew more than 20-fold, while 
materials extraction grew to almost 60 billion tonnes per year 
(Maddison 2009). This level of materials consumed by the human 
population is of the same scale as major global material flows in 
ecosystems, such as the amount of biomass produced annually 
by green plants (Krausmann et al. 2009; UNEP 2009b). 

Consumption and production trends appear to have stabilized 
in developed countries, while in emerging economies such 
as Brazil, China, India, and Mexico, per-person resource use 
and associated environmental impacts have increased since 
2000 (SERI 2008), and the less developed countries are just 
beginning the transition towards higher consumption levels. 
Should global economic development continue in a business-
as-usual mode and population projections persist through 
2050, another sharp rise in the level of global resource use  
is likely (Krausmann et al. 2009; SERI 2008).
 
Over the period 1970–2010, average global growth rates in 
GDP per person measured in purchasing power parity (ppp) 
fluctuated between -2 and 5 per cent annually; the average was 
about 3.1 per cent (World Bank 2011a). Since 2001, however, 
China has grown at 10 per cent per year, a seven-year doubling 
time, and India at 8 per cent per year, a nine-year doubling time, 
with environmental pressures increasing at much the same 
pace. As a result, China is now the world’s largest emitter of

Box 1.2 Expressing prosperity beyond GDP 

Within the traditional accounting framework for benchmarking 
economic performance, a considerable amount of nature’s 
capital and services is externalized (excluded), thereby 
ignoring key environmental pressures and the forces driving 
them. Including those pressures requires alternative metrics 
to GDP and related benchmarks. Such alternatives can be 
measured in either monetary or physical units.

An alternative monetary approach seeks to maintain the 
traditional accounting framework and its reliance on market 
transactions, but augments it by internalizing (including) 
environmental costs and pressures. A common approach for 
accomplishing this is to assign market values to nature’s assets 
and services with the goal of taking full account of both market 
and non-market costs and benefits (Abraham and Mackie 
2005; NRC 2004, 1994; Nordhaus and Kokkelenberg 1999), a 
procedure that was first attempted by Costanza et al. in 1997. 

An alternative physical approach, stemming from the industrial 
metabolism or industrial ecology tradition, seeks to identify 
the rates and volumes of material flows through the economy. 
A system such as material flow accounting (MFA) is presumed 
to reveal more accurately the pressures on resources and the 
undesirable impacts on the environment from any part of the 
life cycle of resources – from extraction through combustion 
or conversion into a usable commodity and consumer 
consumption, to recycling, disposal or stewardship. 

Two leading indicators are used to chart trends in global, 
national and urban material flows: 
•	total	material	extraction	per	unit	of	GDP;	and	
•	metabolic	rates	–	the	amount	of	resource	use	per	person.	

During the 20th century, total material extraction increased 
from 7 billion tonnes to almost 60 billion, while GDP increased 
by a factor of 24 (Krausmann et al. 2009). Over the same 
period per-person resource use doubled from 4.6 tonnes to 
around 9 tonnes, while per person income increased by a 
factor of seven (UNEP 2011a; Krausmann et al. 2009). At the 
same time, resource prices were declining or stagnant. Taken 

together, these data indicate that resource decoupling or 
dematerialization, both in the aggregate and on a per-person 
basis, took place during the 20th century. Since there were 
no overarching policies specifically devoted to decoupling 
during the period, it appears that it took place spontaneously, 
perhaps due to forces within the global economic system. 
However, there is a clear need for further research to identify 
the responsible factors.

A more serious challenge – due to limitations in the available 
data – is determining whether material use is increasing or 
decreasing on a country-by-country basis. In a production-
based system of accounts, environmental pressure is allocated 
to the country where the pressure occurs, while a consumption-
based system allocates the pressure to the country where a 
product is finally consumed. 

Furthermore, trade accounts only measure the weight of 
traded commodities entering a country, ignoring hidden or 
indirect flows – materials that are extracted or moved but 
are not traded directly. Finally, industrialized countries tend 
to be material importers while developing countries tend to 
be exporters. Due to these data limitations and patterns, the 
resource intensity of the advanced countries may be grossly 
understated because their high resource use is actually 
happening in exporting countries (Caldeira and Davis 2011). 

These data limitations may account for the finding that, with 
the same standard of living, more densely populated areas 
and regions consume fewer resources per person than do less 
densely populated ones (Lenzen et al. 2006; Larivière and 
Lafrance 1999; Kenworthy and Laube 1996). The difference 
is even more pronounced when comparing industrialized 
high-density areas with low-density ones. Since high-density 
areas are nearly equivalent to urbanization, these areas – not 
the hinterland – are the hub of international trade where 
goods and services are received, while the resource intensity 
and environmental impacts are felt elsewhere as resource 
extraction typically takes place in areas of low population 
(Rosa and Dietz 2009). 

greenhouse gases per year and, since 2010, its economy is 
second in size only to the United States (World Bank 2011a). 

Much of China’s economic growth has come from its expansion 
in manufacturing, both for domestic markets and for export. By 
comparison, the average growth rate is negative for sub-Saharan 
Africa and less than 1 per cent for the Middle East and North 
Africa, although Figure 1.4 shows considerable variation across 
these regions. In addition, since 1995, Russia’s annual growth 
rate has fluctuated between -7.8 per cent and 10.0 per cent, with 
an average of 3.3 per cent (World Bank 2011c). 

It is difficult to project economic growth: during the 1980s and 
1990s the Republic of Korea experienced growth spurts at rates 
similar to China’s and India’s recent ones, before slowing to 
more moderate rates (World Bank 2011b). Using the concept 
of an ecological footprint, which aggregates all environmental 
pressures into a measure of hypothetical land required to meet 
current rates of resource use (Wackernagel et al. 2002, 1999), 
China and India are expected to appropriate 37 per cent of the 
projected increase in global footprint over the period 2001–2015 
unless they are able to improve their production efficiency 
annually by 2.9 and 2.2 per cent, respectively (Dietz et al. 2007). 

Drivers 11

Whether these growth rates are realistic when put in the context 
of the Earth System’s biophysical boundaries remains to be seen 
(Chapter 7) (Rockström et al. 2009). 

Figure 1.5 A simple interpretation of the 
environmental Kuznets curve

Quality
Technology is a key factor in the production of goods and 
services and an important one in terms of environmental 
impact. It has been argued that over time, factors of intensity 
or quality, affected by technological innovation, may more than 
compensate for the adverse effects of the rise in population, 
so that economic growth eventually leads to environmental 
improvements. An example of this is greenhouse gas emission 
rates in developed countries since 1970, where, it is claimed, 
emissions increased more slowly than economic activity 
because of shifts towards technologies that have a lower 
environmental impact (Bruvoll and Medin 2003; Hamilton and 
Turton 2002). However, it is not certain whether other sectors 
were so successful – efforts to reduce deforestation at the 
national level might have shown domestic improvement, but 
demand may have driven increased deforestation in other 
countries (Meyfroidt and Lambin 2009). 

The environmental Kuznets curve (Figure 1.5) (Grossman and 
Krueger 1995) suggested that as countries become more affluent, 
concern about the environment increases, leading to policies that 
protect it. At the same time, preferences shift away from the most 
environmentally damaging goods and services.

This theory has been extensively examined (Carson 2010; Mol 
2010; York et al. 2010; Aslanidis and Iranzo 2009; Galeotti et 
al. 2009; Jalil and Mahmud 2009; Lee et al. 2009; Roberts and 
Grimes 1997) and while debate continues, there seems to be 
clear evidence that some companies and industrial sectors have 
reduced their environmental impact, as the theory predicts. 
However, there are many obstacles to a shift towards more 
environmentally benign technologies: in some cases, these are 
economic challenges as environmentally sound technologies 
often have higher overall costs. But in many cases, simple 
cost/benefit calculations are not sufficient to explain the slow 
pace of growth in new technologies. For example, although 
researchers have noted the energy efficiency gap for years 
(Jaffe and Stavins 1994), whereby economically beneficial 
investments in energy efficiency have not been made, neither 
consumers nor industry have made significant investments 
in closing that gap despite the potentially favourable returns 
in energy costs saved, particularly when life-cycle costing is 
applied.

On the other hand, technological change that improves resource 
efficiency can have a perverse environmental effect by decreasing 
the costs of resource use and thus increasing demand. If 
the increased demand is greater than the efficiency gains, 
the overall consumption of a resource can actually increase, 
with concomitant increases in environmental impact. This 
phenomenon is known as the Jevons paradox or the rebound 
effect (Polimeni and Polimeni 2006; York 2006). The choice of 
technology, which is shaped by economic factors and individual

and public decisions, is critical in determining the overall human 
impact on the environment. Research to explain the obstacles to 
adopting more environmentally benign, cost-effective technology 
is just beginning. One key factor, at least for households, is 
unfamiliarity with life-cycle costing and a lack of understanding 
of the energy and cost impacts of commonly used technologies 
(Attari et al. 2010; Carrico et al. 2009), and it appears that the 
same factors may also affect organizational decision making.

Values
It is commonplace to identify values as a key driver of 
environmental change. At one level, the argument is 
straightforward: human decisions, especially about 
consumption, are influenced by values and those decisions 
have impacts on the environment. However, research on human 
decision making notes that values are only one element in 
the cognitive processes, with beliefs and norms also of great 
importance (Stern 2011). While some decisions reflect a formal 
weighing of values and beliefs, many are made without much 
reflection, on the basis of normative expectations, emotions 
and interpretations of symbols or quick judgements (Kahneman 
2003; Jaeger et al. 2001). 

There is a voluminous canon of literature exploring the social 
psychology of environmental decision making, in which several 
generalizations can be discerned (Carrico et al. 2011; Schultz 
and Kaiser 2011; Stern 2011; Stern et al. 2010). First, no single 
factor is sufficient to explain such decisions. Values, beliefs and 
norms, and trust in others who must also take action or who are 
providing information, all matter. Second, decisions are often 
context-specific in the sense that individuals read the context, 
such as whether to emphasize a gain or a loss, and frame the 
decision based on that reading. Sometimes individuals act as 

12

Part 1: State and Trends

consumers, sometimes as members of a community, sometimes 
as citizens. Third, social networks are of immense importance 
in providing context as well as shaping values, beliefs, norms, 
trust and other significant factors (Henry 2009; Jackson and Yariv 
2007). Fourth, values, beliefs, norms, trust and other individual 
characteristics interact with the character of the action to be 
taken in shaping behaviour – for example, social psychological 
factors may matter little when a pro-environmental action is 
exceptionally easy or hard to undertake, but may be critical for 
actions of intermediate difficulty (Guagnano et al. 1995). 

trust has not yet been linked to the larger literature on values.
Consumer surveys have revealed a range of reasons why an 
individual is unwilling to pay more for an environmentally 
sensitive product (WBCSD 2010). The top three reasons 
involve poor understanding of, or apathy towards, the negative 
environmental impacts of consumption decisions, while the 
fourth most common was whether the individual viewed an action 
as common practice among their peers. This last point reveals the 
importance of societal pressure on values and by extension how 
decisions that impact the environment are influenced by it.

Social psychology has developed many concepts to explain 
the factors underlying environmental decision making. Among 
these, values have been explored the most thoroughly and tested 
empirically across many national contexts (Dietz et al. 2005). 
In particular, altruism towards other humans, other species 
and the biosphere has consistently been found to predict pro-
environmental attitudes and behaviour. In addition, a willingness 
to cooperate with others in experimental games, conducted in 
both laboratory and field settings, varies considerably across 
individuals and cultures (Henrich et al. 2010, 2005). Recently, the 
propensity to cooperate has been shown to matter in managing 
forest commons (Rustagi et al. 2010; Vollan and Ostrom 2010), 
with a substantial amount of literature showing the importance 
of trust in commons dilemmas (Fehr 2009). However, research on 

Diets 
With economic growth comes a change in dietary intensity, which 
Popkin (2002) describes as the nutrition transition. This happens 
in three states: decreased occurrence of famine with rising 
incomes; the emergence of chronic diet-related diseases due to 
changes in activity and food consumption patterns; and a stage 
of behavioural change where diet and activity levels are better 
managed for prolonged healthier lives. 

The growth in food consumption and related requirements for 
animal feed largely determine the pace at which supplies need 
to grow to keep up with the domestic and export demand for 
agricultural goods. Urbanization, demographic change and 
household wealth in a number of fast-evolving regions – Brazil,

China, India and Indonesia – suggest that changes in food 
consumption patterns are likely to have profound effects on 
regional food systems (Satterthwaite et al. 2010). These changes 
in consumption and consumption preferences introduce increased 
pressures on food and energy systems from the demand side, 
which forces compensating adjustments to take place on the 
supply side through market-mediated, price-driven interactions 
with producers.

As regional economies continue to grow, so, too, does the 
consumption and production of of meat (Figure 1.6). Livestock 
production is the largest anthropogenic land use, accounting for 
30 per cent of the land surface of the globe and 70 per cent of 
all agricultural land; 33 per cent of total arable land is used for 
producing animal feed (Steinfeld et al. 2006). Pelletier and Tyedmers 
(2010) suggest that, by 2050, the livestock sector alone may 
occupy the majority of, or significantly overshoot, recent estimates 
of humanity’s biophysical limits within three environmental 
areas: climate change, reactive nitrogen mobilization, and 
appropriation of plant biomass at planetary scales.

As urban areas are generally wealthier than rural ones, there 
are considerable differences in dietary composition, with 
urban diets characterized by higher levels of meat, dairy and 
vegetable oil. These foods are often imported and require more 
energy-intensive production (de Haen et al. 2003; Popkin 2001). 
Globalization and urbanization are cited as causing dietary 
convergence and adaptation. The former refers to the focusing 
of caloric intake on a smaller number of staple crops, such as 
wheat, rice and maize, with concomitant health impacts. Dietary 
adaptation is characterized by a greater reliance on processed 
foods due to lifestyle changes, greater exposure to advertising 
and time constraints on food preparation. This concentration of 
consumption also favours the concentration of the food supply 
chain among a relatively small number of corporations, with an 
implicit preference for supermarkets and larger-scale agricultural 
production (Kennedy et al. 2005). 

Energy-water nexus  
Another important dynamic of consumption is the trade-off 
between energy and water consumption. This dynamic is 
important for both energy production and agriculture. Gerbens-
Leenes et al. (2009) estimate that 60–80 per cent of water used 
globally is dedicated to irrigation, rising to nearly 90 per cent 
in some low-rainfall areas. In addition, energy use for irrigation 
can be significant. In India, where the government often heavily 
subsidizes water pumping, 15–20 per cent of electricity is used 
for this purpose (Shah et al. 2004). Energy use for agriculture 
is considerable in both developed and developing countries, 
although in developed countries the energy used for processing 
and transporting food can be twice that of the entire agricultural 
production sector (Bazilian et al. 2011). 

Water can also be an important resource for energy production 
and mineral extraction. However, freshwater pollution is a 
common side effect of mining, including recent hydraulic 
fracturing activities (Scott et al. 2011). China suffers from 

14

Part 1: State and Trends

water scarcity due to a dwindling supply as well as to industrial 
pollution; the World Bank (2006) estimates that up to a third of 
water scarcity in China is due to pollution, the cost of which is 
equivalent to 1–3 per cent of GDP. 

THE DRIVER-PRESSURE CONTINUUM
As population and economic development have continued to grow 
despite depressions and downturns, technological innovations 
have enhanced the integration of communities and societies 
into a global civilization. Technological advances in energy and 
transport continually generate new opportunities for growth 
in production and consumption, while ingenuity applied to 
communication and mobility has created new goods and services 
that previous generations could not have imagined. The growth 
and integration of human settlements, societies and relationships 
is evidenced by rapid urbanization and globalization.

Energy 
Quantity
As the world population increases, more people aspire to higher 
material living standards – creating an ever greater demand for 
goods and services as well as for the energy required to provide 
these. From 1992 until 2008, per-person energy consumption 
increased at a rate of 5 per cent annually. In 2009 total global 
energy use decreased for the first time in 30 years – by 2.2 per cent 
– as a result of the financial and economic crisis (Enerdata 2011); 
half of this occurred in the OECD countries (IEA 2011). Oil, 
natural gas and nuclear power consumption all decreased while 
hydroelectric and renewable energy consumption increased. Coal 
was the only energy source that was not affected. Primary energy 
consumption in 2010 is estimated to have risen by 4.7 per cent 
worldwide, easily surpassing the minor reduction in 2009. The 
rate of growth in the future, however, is expected to decrease 
due to an assumed levelling of population growth and continued 
improvements in energy efficiency (IEA 2011). 

By 2030, more than 55 per cent of the population of Asia will be urban.

The shares of energy inputs are likely to change, with the 
proportion produced from oil decreasing and natural gas 
increasing. Coal levels are expected to stay relatively constant 
and nuclear energy use will increase due to investments in Asia. 
However, with potential policy changes following the Fukushima 
disaster in 2011, it is difficult to predict the growth trajectory of 
nuclear power. If nuclear energy plans are not followed through, 
more coal is likely to be used, with significant implications 
for climate change mitigation efforts (IEA 2011). Developing 
regions show a particularly strong increase in per-person energy 
consumption between 2005 and 2010, although, as of 2010, this 
seems to be levelling off. The three major economic sectors in 
terms of energy consumption (IEA 2011) are: 
•	manufacturing:	33	per	cent;
•	households:	29	per	cent;
•	transport:	26	per	cent.

Electricity and heat generation account for more than 40 per cent 
of all CO2 emissions (IEA 2010). Between 1992 and 2008, the 
annual rise in CO2 emissions of more than 3 per cent and the 
total rise of 66 per cent – a much greater increase than that of 
the global population – was primarily the result of growth in 
industrial production, as well as higher living standards in many 
developing countries. 

On a per-person basis, the largest growth in electricity production 
occurred in the developed countries, increasing from 8.3 megawatt 
hours (MWh) in 1992 to nearly 10 MWh in 2008, a difference of 
1.7 MWh per person (IEA 2010), though in percentage terms this 
was the smallest rise at 22 per cent. The global average per-person 
electricity production grew by 33 per cent, from 2.2 MWh in 1992 
to 3.0 MWh in 2008, while that of developing countries grew by 
68 per cent, from 1 MWh to 1.7 MWh (IEA 2010).

In 2010, 1.44 billion people globally – around 20 per cent of 
the world population – were still suffering from energy poverty, 
without access to reliable electricity or the power grid, and entirely 
dependent on biomass for cooking and lighting (UNEP 2011b).

The energy commodity that dominates trade volume and value 
is crude oil, with China continuing to rival the United States in 
terms of consumption (EIA 2010). The Middle East accounts 
for about half of all global oil trade (IEA 2008). Coal production 
increased by 3–5 per cent per year during 2005–2009, with 
China experiencing a 16 per cent increase in production during 
2008–2009 and reaching 44 per cent of the world’s total coal 
production of 3.05 billion tonnes. With rapidly increasing energy 
demand, however, China became a net importer of coal for the 
first time in 2007 (Kahrl and Roland-Holst 2008). The United 
States is the second largest producer of coal at 975 million 
tonnes per year, followed by India producing 566 million tonnes. 

Quality
Renewable energy production is gaining much attention: the 
amount of energy produced from renewable sources, including

(REN21 2011). However, the largest renewable source is biomass 
at 10 per cent, with nearly two-thirds of that used in cooking 
and heating in developing countries (IPCC 2011). Thus, when 
biomass is excluded, other renewable sources provide only 
about 3 per cent of world energy.

There has been a 30 000 per cent rise in solar energy supply 
since 1992, a 6 000 per cent increase in wind energy and a  
3 500 per cent rise in biofuel production, all from very low bases. 
This is mainly due to the decreasing cost of these technologies 
and the 2010 adoption by 199 countries of policies to promote 
renewable energy (REN21 2011).

There has been a rapid rise in the production of biomass-based 
fuels for transport – from maize, sugar cane, oil palm and 
rapeseed. While ethanol has been widely used in Brazil for two 
decades, its use accelerated globally at the end of the 1990s, 
increasing by 20 per cent each year to reach 30 million tonnes 
of oil equivalent in 2009. In the early years of the 21st century, 
biodiesel became available, with production growing at around 
60 per cent per year, reaching nearly 13 million tonnes of oil 
equivalent in 2009. However, recent information on biofuel 
production raises concerns about the direct environmental and 
social impacts of land clearance and conversion, the introduction 
of potentially invasive species, the overuse of water and the 
consequences for the global food market. An additional cause 
for concern is the purchase or leasing of land by wealthier 
nations to produce food and biofuels – typically in developing 
and sometimes semi-arid countries. This trend may have serious 
impacts on fossil and renewable water resources, as well as on 
local food security (UNEP 2009a).

Drivers 15

Investment in greening the energy sector is setting new records, 
totalling US$211 billion in 2010, up 32 per cent from 2009, and 
nearly five and a half times the 2004 figure. For the first time, new 
investment in utility-scale renewable energy projects in developing 
countries surpassed that of developed economies (UNEP 2011c).

The number of nuclear power plants, seen by some as an 
opportunity to meet the growing demand for energy, has 
increased by more than 20 per cent since 1992, rising to 435 by 
mid-2012. According to the International Atomic Energy Agency 
(IAEA 2008), in the 30 countries that have nuclear power, the 
share of electricity generated ranges from 78 per cent in France 
to 2 per cent in China, which has 14 operational plants, 25 
under construction and more planned (WNA 2011a). Since 1992, 
energy production from nuclear power sources has grown 
by almost 30 per cent, although the share of nuclear power in 
the total supply has fallen from 17.5 per cent in 1992 to 13.5 
per cent in 2008. Today, around the world, 60 plants are under 
construction, 155 planned and 339 proposed (WNA 2011b). 

Global energy consumption is expected to continue to grow. 
Though China’s energy intensity decreased by 66 per cent 
between 1980 and 2002 (IEA 2008; Polimeni and Polimeni 
2006), India’s energy use per unit of GDP remained relatively 
constant over the same period and, due to its growing economy, 
the country is expected to contribute 8 per cent of the world’s 
projected growth in emissions by 2030 (World Bank 2008). 
If the international community continues to have difficulty in 
addressing climate change in the near future, temperatures 
could increase by 3.5–6oC by the end of the century (IEA 2011). 
To stem the rise in global GHG emissions, the Kyoto Protocol 
encouraged the transfer of cleaner technologies from developed 
to developing economies. Trade was assumed to be the means 
of distributing these technologies, but without a significant 
reduction in existing trade barriers, this route will have limited 
impact (World Bank 2008).

Serious inequities remain in meeting global demand for access 
to energy. Today, 1.3 billion people are lacking electricity and 
2.7 billion people still rely on the traditional use of biomass for 
food preparation, with concomitant impacts on deforestation 
rates, soil erosion and human health (IEA 2011). The reliance 
on fuelwood also has a demographic aspect, as per-person 
fuelwood consumption is shown to increase with decreasing 
household size but to decrease with urbanization, indicating 
a wealth effect (Knight and Rosa 2011). In order to achieve 
universal access to primary energy by 2030, an annual 
investment of US$48 billion is needed (IEA 2011).

Transport 
Quantity
Transport serves people, production and consumption and is 
an important facilitator of trade. The global economy is currently 
recovering from a severe recession, with global industrial 
production and trade climbing back to pre-crisis levels, albeit 
with marked geographic differences: GDP is growing fastest in 
China, by 10.3 per cent per year, and India, by 9.7 per cent, in 

2010. Data published by Global Insight (2010) suggest that in the 
next 40 years Brazil, Russia, India and China (the BRIC countries) 
will start to approach the United States in terms of GDP, 
surpassing Germany, the United Kingdom, France and Italy, with 
the distinct possibility that China will have the world’s highest 
GDP by 2050. This unequal growth has implications for world 
trade and the flow of goods, posing considerable challenges and 
opportunities in terms of logistics and supply chains. 

Countries and entire regions appear to be specializing in their 
attempts to become competitive, creating even greater demand 
for transport. For instance, Europe, the United States, Canada 
and Japan are dependent on fruit exports from Central and 
South America, some Western European countries, many Eastern 
European countries, and portions of Africa. Similar differential 
production-consumption trends happen with all products, pushing 
the demand for transport even higher and making freight inelastic 
to fuel prices. An evolving trend to manage this ever increasing 
world trade is containerization, which by many in the industry 
is considered a major revolution in handling goods, using larger 
ships to achieve economies of scale. It is estimated that from 80 to 
90 per cent of world trade is by sea (UNCTAD 2011). 

In the United States, the Bureau of Transportation Statistics 
(BTS 2011) reports that container trade in 2005 and 2006 was 
double that of the previous decade, increasing to 46.3 million 
20-foot-equivalent units (TEUs, 19–43 cubic metres). At the 
global scale, container trade tripled during the same period. 
The European Union (EU), the world’s largest trading bloc, 
carries out 90 per cent of its external trade and 40 per cent of 
its internal trade by sea, totalling 3.5 billion tonnes (Reynaud 
2009; Goulias 2008). However, studies in major ports show 
that any environmental benefits of seafaring cargo require 
significant attention at the place of loading and unloading. The 
Port of Los Angeles in California, a major hub, has, for example, 
implemented a variety of policies including the introduction 
of cleaner trucks with refuelling stations for natural gas, 
performance standards for cargo handlers and harbour craft, 
modernized and cleaner rail locomotives, and reduced vessel 
speeds (Port of Los Angeles 2010). 

After a slump in 2008 and 2009, air freight began to return to 
its pre-economic-crisis levels, with annual international growth 
of 21 per cent in 2010, although 2011 growth is expected to be 
heavily dependent on consumer spending (IATA 2011). Data from 
the International Transport Forum (ITF) show some recovery for 
rail freight but it is still suffering from the economic crisis with 
unknown implications for the long term; exceptionally, India 
continues to increase its rail freight. Similarly, recovery of road 
freight is very slow at the national and international levels for 
many OECD and ITF countries. 
 
For passenger travel China, India and Brazil recorded 7.1 per cent 
growth in 2010 relative to 2009. According to the International 
Air Transport Association, there were 2.4 billion domestic and 
international passengers in 2010, approximately 6.4 per cent more 
than ever before, with a similar trend observed in passenger

kilometres travelled. Rail passenger travel continued to decline, 
providing space for possible substitution by freight. Data on 
passenger kilometres travelled in private cars suffers poor 
harmonization, yet it is clear that the economic crisis reduced 
overall travel. Moreover, possible saturation of passenger travel 
by car is observed in developed economies that exhibit non-
significant increases in passenger kilometres, hovering at around 
one digit percentage growth per year. 

Quality
While transport enables human interactions that contribute to 
development, the infrastructure for fast, motorized means of 
travel also creates displacement and barriers that can divide 
communities and reduce well-being. Roads and the enormous 
amount of parking to store the world’s 1 billion cars are the 
commonest barriers, but airports and seaports for container 
ships are also significant. 

In societies with extremely high levels of mobility, inequities 
in the social distribution of related environmental pressures 
and benefits are of increasing concern (Adams 1999). Because 
most human settlements are located close to supplies of water 
and agricultural land, transport infrastructure displaces food 
production while also fragmenting landscapes that are then 
less able to support wildlife (Huijser et al. 2008). Transport 
also has secondary environmental impacts through expanded 
human access to land, as the infrastructure promotes 
economic activities such as mining, forestry or power 
generation in new locations. In addition, transport enables 
more extensive permanent human settlement, particularly 
suburban and urban growth. 

Most energy for transport comes from fossil fuels, and the rise 
of the car has produced various specific environmental impacts, 
from urban health problems through land and water degradation 
to contributing to climate change. Many people are optimistic 
about the long-term prospects for shifting to cars powered by fuel 
cells and electric motors, but a near-term change will be difficult, 
and the car is noticeably more intensive in its environmental 
impacts than its competitor technologies, exhibiting the highest 
levels of energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions 
(Chester and Horvath 2009). Private car ownership can also 
impact patterns of urbanization by permitting dispersed and 
low-density sprawl, which in many contexts reflects individual 
household dissatisfaction with urban environments, but 
collectively degrades environmental quality. Like the transport 
infrastructure that makes them possible, these new or expanded 
built areas impinge on natural landscapes and amplify the direct 
environmental impacts of transport. 
 
There may have been a temporary decrease in transport activity 
in, for example, the United Kingdom and United States due to 
the economic recession (Millard-Ball and Schipper 2011; Metz 
2010). However, these declines are likely to be outweighed by 
increases in private vehicle ownership in rapidly developing 
low- and middle-income nations. At present, the number of motor 
vehicles in the world is growing much faster than the number of 
people (World Bank 2012). While it is unlikely that the levels of 
hypermobility reached in the United States will ever be reached 
in many other nations, there is still massive potential for growth 
in the level of travel and shifts towards individual motorized 
vehicles, especially as incomes increase. In developing nations 
including China and India, the ownership and use of highly

the built environment – whether residential and commercial 
buildings or transport infrastructure. Beijing and Shanghai’s 
rapid economic growth, for example, has been accompanied 
by a decrease in the proportion of emissions due to industrial 
activities since 1985. With the increase in personal vehicle 
ownership, however, emissions from transport have increased 
significantly, sevenfold for Beijing and eightfold for Shanghai 
between 1985 and 2006 (Dhakal 2009). This increase may, 
in part, have been offset by an energy-efficiency labelling 
programme implemented by the Chinese government, credited 
with avoiding 1.4 billion tonnes of CO2 emissions for  
2006–2010 (Zhan et al. 2011). 

In general, urban populations in developing countries generate 
higher greenhouse gas emissions per person than surrounding 
rural populations, while the opposite is true for developed 
countries (Dhakal 2010). Energy consumption in urban areas, 
much like food consumption, can be far removed from where 
environmental impacts occur, with populations remaining 
oblivious of the greenhouse gas and water pollution impacts  
of their consumption (Scott et al. 2011).  

Due to the links between them, it is difficult to reliably project 
rates of spatial expansion in urban areas without accurate 
projections of population growth and GDP. The challenge is 
magnified by recent research suggesting that the relationship 
between these three factors can vary significantly across regions. 
Assessing changing urban spatial spread using satellites shows 
urban areas to be growing at an average rate of 3–7 per cent per 
year, with China exhibiting the highest rates. The contribution 
of population and GDP growth to this expansion has been found 
to be 28 and 72 per cent respectively for North America and 23 
and 30 per cent respectively for India. In the same study, African 
city growth showed no relationship to GDP, although there is a 
recognition that in many developing countries there is significant 
informal economic activity that is not captured by GDP statistics 
(Seto et al. 2010). 

In terms of the spatial distribution of people in growing cities, 
the defining feature, perhaps most common in East Asia, is 
peripheral development (Seto et al. 2010). Quantifying this 
phenomenon using satellite imagery for 2000 shows a range 
of estimates of the total spatial spread of urban areas of 
0.2–2.4 per cent of the terrestrial land surface, due partially to 
differing definitions of urban land cover (Potere and Schneider 
2007). In developed countries such as the United States and 
Canada, about half the urban population lives in suburbs, while 
in the developing world squatter settlements or slums host more 
than one-third of urban populations (UN-Habitat 2003).

polluting motorcycles is increasing faster than cars (Pucher et al. 
2007). Even when more fuel-efficient vehicles are introduced, 
rising numbers may outweigh efficiency benefits.

However, with aggressive moves by governments and 
advocacy groups in the creation of green markets, two related 
phenomena could emerge. The first is an offset trade market 
in which companies can buy offsets, as futures and options, 
to counterbalance their inability to manage and decrease CO2 
production (Lequet and Bellasen 2008). The second is an attempt 
to develop carbon-neutral supply chains in which the amount 
of CO2 produced is offset by a variety of mitigating actions that 
include partnerships with the local supply chains. From a policy 
perspective, these could deliver some development benefit by 
encouraging small local producers to partner with multinational 
companies, helping reach carbon neutrality. Similarly, new 
markets are developing around a lifestyle based on promoting 
health, the environment, social justice, personal justice 
and sustainable living. Such developments offer new policy 
opportunities for more sustainable development worldwide that 
incorporates green transport policies across all sectors.

Urbanization  
Quantity
Urbanization exhibits complex interactions with food, discussed 
earlier, and energy. Urban areas, which house half the world’s 
population, utilize two-thirds of global energy and produce 
70 per cent of global carbon emissions (IEA 2008). The amount 
of energy an urban area consumes is largely dependent on 

The spatial distribution of cities demonstrates the complex 
interactions between urbanization and transport. For instance, 
when comparing per-person greenhouse gas emissions, 
Bangkok is dominated by transport emissions, while New 
York and London have significantly larger contributions from 
residential and commercial buildings (Croci et al. 2011). 
The ability to travel within a city is extremely important 

18

Part 1: State and Trends

both in terms of the environmental impact and of economic 
productivity (Bertaud et al. 2011). In developing countries 
the majority of trips are taken by commuters but, as incomes 
increase, individuals are likely to make more personal trips. 
This preference often precipitates the acquisition of personal 
vehicles, as the locations of shopping or entertainment 
centres, schools or hospitals are widely spread and less easily 
connected by a public transport system (Bertaud et al. 2011). 
Finally, the type of fuel used is an important factor affecting the 
environmental impact of urban areas. Many trains already run 
on electricity, but should electric vehicle use increase, more 
electricity will be needed and – unless energy sources are priced 
according to their carbon intensity – an increase in electricity 
production using coal is likely, leading to significant increases  
in greenhouse gas emissions (Bertaud et al. 2011).

Quality
Cities have been seen as an opportunity for developing more 
sustainable resource management and reducing greenhouse 
gas emissions. While per-person emissions are generally lower 
in the cities of developed countries than in surrounding rural 
areas, the sources are much more diffuse and therefore difficult 
to manage with one overarching policy tool (Bertaud et al. 2011). 
Beyond mitigation activities, cities, particularly in developing 
countries, need to evolve climate adaptation measures (World 
Bank 2011d). Several cities across South America, Africa and 
Asia have shown significant leadership in developing innovative 
adaptation strategies (Heinrichs et al. 2011). 

Developing cities are being encouraged to achieve zero waste, 
the principles of which include a reduction in waste incineration, 

the recycling of greater volumes of paper and plastics and the 
mining of precious metals and rare earth elements from existing 
landfills (Zaman and Lehmann 2011). 

The question remains whether the Earth can support several 
billion additional people with a direct impact on land through 
subsistence farming, or additional urban billions with indirect 
impacts through consumer demand for fats and proteins from 
meats that are mostly produced on large corporate farms. The 
answer to this question will ultimately reveal how much land 
will be converted to livestock rearing, feedstock production 
and agriculture. Not evident in the short term is whether an 
accelerated or delayed demographic transition is more or less 
taxing on land systems. But if the living standards of the poorest 
are raised to more equitably match those of the developed 
world, then population growth should slow and the related 
environmental impact should begin to diminish. Demographic 
and health transitions will continue to be major predictors of 
environmental change in general and of land-use and land-cover 
change in particular. Fundamental to facilitating demographic 
and health transitions will be investments in maternal and child 
health and education.

Globalization  
Quantity 
Trade in food, fuels and minerals has increased dramatically 
over recent decades and shows few signs of slowing. 
International trade has grown rapidly since 1990, by 12 per cent 
per year, doubling in six years (Figure 1.7) (Peters et al. 2011). 
In addition, annual emissions from exports have grown at 
4.3 per cent, often due to production moving from developed

Drivers 19

2007, for example, 8–12 per cent of China’s CO2 emissions were 
attributable to exports to the United States (Xu et al. 2009). 

Quality
Globalization is confounding the expected effect of the 
environmental Kuznets curve in countries with emerging 
economies. With affluence should come improvement in 
environmental conditions, but the link is proving difficult to 
confirm. In the case of China, nitrogen oxides and sulphur 
dioxide emissions have shown a complicated relationship with 
increasing income, suggesting that the reliance on coal-fired 
power may be negating improvements in other manufacturing 
technology (Brajer et al. 2011). 
 
Some invoke a traditional economic dynamic at work – a 
regulatory race to the bottom, where deregulation is expected 
to attract economic activity and create a comparative advantage 
over competitors. This notion suggests that concern for the 
environment and increasing environmental regulation in the 
developed countries result in migration of the most polluting 
industries to less affluent nations, although explicit evidence of 
this is inconclusive (Kirkpatrick and Scrieciu 2008). A different 
explanation has also been offered – that the pattern is more akin 
to the rapidly industrializing countries being stuck at the bottom, 
since there were no regulations to begin with (Porter 1999). A 
related argument has also been made over the environmental 
effects of trade (Jorgenson 2007; Cole 2003). 

Either way, the consequence is the same – the creation of centres 
of pollution in developing countries. This suggests that the 
environmental Kuznets curve, relevant to a national context, has 
been disguising the displacement of pollution across national 
borders, with consumption in the most affluent nations driving 
environmentally polluting production and consumption to 
less affluent ones. For example, Cole (2006, 2004, 2003) has 
shown that trade increases environmental damage in the least 
developed countries while decreasing many forms of pollution in 
developed ones. Perhaps the environmental Kuznets curve does 
not work when all borders have been crossed by pollution.

Energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions seem to 
follow this displacement pattern. A low-income country with 
less stringent regulations will find that an increase in trade 
openness increases energy consumption as its comparative 
advantage in dirty production deepens, while a high-income 
country will see energy consumption fall in response to trade 
liberalization (Cole 2006).

So, will future goods produced for consumption inevitably 
also produce more pollution, despite regulations in developed 
countries? Carbon-intensive industries are leaving areas of 
stricter carbon regulation and moving to those that do not 
have such regulations (World Bank 2008). At the beginning of 
the 21st century, developed countries remained the largest 
greenhouse gas emitters in per-person terms. However, in the 
next few decades, the growth of emissions will come primarily 
from developing countries. So, despite 20 years of negotiations

including solar, is on the rise. © Fernando Alonso Herrero/iStock

countries to sites with less sophisticated technology in 
developing countries (Peters et al. 2011). 

Greater liberalization of trade can exert pressure on the 
environment in any of three ways: 
•		increasing	economic	activity	and	by	extension	natural	

resource extraction, a scale effect;

•		changing	the	type	of	economic	activity	to	either	more	or	less	

polluting industries, affecting intensity; and 

•		changing	the	technology	or	intensity	of	production	that	

can sometimes encourage more environmentally friendly 
production techniques (Kirkpatrick and Scrieciu 2008). 

Regardless of the nature of the local change, wider trade allows 
the environmental impacts of production to be completely 
removed, or decoupled, from the site of consumption. 

Such decoupling means that household consumption in 
developed countries can have significant environmental impacts 
elsewhere, particularly in developing nations. Tracing the 
impacts of consumption in Norway, Peters and Hertwich (2006) 
found that a household’s environmental impacts in foreign 
countries embodied 61 per cent of its indirect emissions of CO2, 
87 per cent of sulphur dioxide, and 34 per cent of nitrogen 
oxides, while imports only represented 22 per cent of household 
expenses (Wiedmann et al. 2007). 
 
China is an instructive case for understanding trade. In the second 
half of the 20th century, it rapidly shifted its economy towards a 
processing base, resulting in a change from being a net exporter 
of primary resources to a net importer. Much of this processed 
merchandise is exported directly, with China’s environment 
absorbing the pollution (Ma et al. 2006). Between 2002 and

Box 1.3 Greenhouse gas emissions and international trade

Recently developed analytic methodologies allow the 
representation of carbon emissions embodied in goods and 
services that are internationally produced, consumed and 
traded (Peters and Hertwich 2006). Plotting these data over 
time illustrates changes in trade balances and the transfer of 
emissions (Caldeira and Davis 2011). The most recent emission 
and trade data reveal the effects of the global financial crisis 
that started in 2008 (Peters et al. 2012).

Figure 1.8 tracks economic activity and CO2 emissions 
in developed and developing countries for 1990–2010. 
The tinted areas represent relative trade balances, with 
consumption lower than production in developing countries, 
but higher than production in developed countries. In 
developing countries, the total emissions embodied in 
the production and consumption of goods and services 
rose steeply, especially after 2002, with the trade balance 
increasing slowly as production and consumption diverged. 
In contrast, the emissions embodied in production and 

consumption in developed countries were more horizontal until 
about 2002, after which they rose steeply, peaking in 2008. 
Their negative trade balance increased over the decades. 
As represented by embodied carbon emissions, developed 
countries seem to be back to business as usual by 2010, while 
emissions in developing countries have passed them with 
hardly a pause. On a per-person basis a large disparity persists 
between CO2 emissions from developed and developing 
countries, as shown on the right. 

Although the global financial crisis could have presented 
an opportunity to establish the decoupling of economic 
development from carbon emissions, the return of high 
emissions growth in 2010 may mark the passing of the 
opportunity. The effects of environmentally sound and low-
carbon economic stimulus packages are not yet evident, but 
the persistent implementation of low-carbon economic plans 
oriented towards resource-efficiency could show positive effects 
in future tracking of embodied emissions (Peters et al. 2012).

direct and linear way as a result of human stresses, or that may 
have more complicated dynamics (Levin 1998). Although some 
can absorb a substantial amount of stress before they exhibit any 
response, change can take place abruptly and irrevocably when 
a threshold is exceeded, leaving little opportunity for human 
adaptation (Carpenter et al. 2011; Folke et al. 2004). 

To understand the dynamics of a complex system, analysts seek 
out leverage points. The study of leverage points in complex 
systems suggests that indirect interventions can have great 
power and direct interventions can be used to enhance co-
benefits, that both probable and possible outcomes should be 
addressed, and that difficult challenges can be broken down to 
manageable portions. The system must be monitored for both 
intended and unintended change (Meadows 1999). 

The idea that the perturbation of a complex ecological system can 
trigger sudden feedbacks is not new: significant scientific research 
has explored thresholds and tipping points that the planetary 
system may face if humanity does not control carbon emissions. 
From the perspective of drivers, understanding feedbacks reveals 
that many of them interact in unpredictable ways. Generally, the 
rates of change in these drivers are not monitored or controlled, 
and so it is not possible to predict or even perceive the thresholds 
as they approach. Critically, the bulk of research has been on 
understanding the effects of drivers on ecosystems, not on the 
effects of changed ecosystems on the drivers – the feedback loop. 

From Figure 1.9, it is evident that the rate of these changes and 
the anthropogenic drivers acting on them are accelerating. In 
fact, Costanza et al. (2007) argues that this “great acceleration” 
began after the Second World War, with the scale of population 
growth and economic consumption and production increasing 
at rates that are orders of magnitude greater than in previous 
eras. It is this scale and speed that makes redirecting humanity’s 
trajectory toward more sustainable development within the limits 
of planetary boundaries an extremely daunting challenge but one 
that we cannot afford to delay.

Overexploitation of natural resources
Considering that 14–16 per cent of animal protein consumed 
globally comes from the sea, overfishing of marine resources 
offers a useful example of overexploitation of natural resources. 
At the global level, overfishing has been widespread but far 
from universal, and in those parts of the world with the capacity 
to manage fisheries, there is evidence that overfishing can be 
stopped and that previously overfished stocks can recover (Worm 
et al. 2009). There remain, however, a number of cases where 
overfishing continues despite the efforts of the international 
community, emphasizing the need for capacity building for both 
policy formulation and effective management.

The greatest expansion in fishing fleets and harvesting 
occurred after the Second World War, as governments provided 
significant subsidies to encourage more investment in harvesting 
technologies, which massively increased yields. In many cases 
the increased yield proved to be unsustainable, and fishery 

declines were widespread by the 1970s (Pauly 2009). Extension 
of jurisdiction with the United Nations Convention on the Law of 
the Sea (UNCLOS) resulted in improved management practices in 
many coastal areas, but a second round of expansion of fishing 
capacity resulted in a second round of declines (FAO 2010). 
Overcapacity remains a serious problem in global fisheries despite 
an international agreement to address it, the 1999 International 
Plan of Action for the Management of Fishing Capacity (FAO 2010). 

Part of the problem in sustainably managing fisheries is the 
difficulty of monitoring the state of fish populations, especially 
in areas outside the jurisdiction of national or international 
authorities where biological information and even basic catch 
data may be unavailable or unreliable. Moreover in many 
fisheries, data are not recorded on species taken as by-catch 
– unwanted fish caught inadvertently, often returned to the 
sea dead or dying – so their status and the impacts of fishing 
are unknown and unmanaged (Myers and Worm 2005). More 
generally, poor monitoring means that there is little knowledge 
about the dynamics of many fish populations, making it difficult 
to discern whether the observed populations are showing signs 
of natural variability or imminent collapse (Carpenter et al. 2011). 
Chapters 4 and 5 discuss the environmental impacts of these 
collapses in more detail.

Driver combinations and feedbacks on human health 
Looking specifically at food production, human and ecosystem 
exposure to chemicals increased dramatically with the 
industrialization of agriculture (Wallinga 2009). There has 
been limited research on the human and environmental health 
impacts of long-term exposure to these chemicals, but it is 
known that the risks are much higher in developing countries 
where 99 per cent of current global deaths from pesticide 
exposure occur, both from occupational exposure and from 
casual exposure resulting from lax or absent health and safety 
controls (De Silva et al. 2006). 

Nitrate pollution from both crop cultivation and livestock 
production is among the most destructive impacts of food 
production, with the scale of meat production having serious 
ramifications for local pollution levels. In the United States, for 
example, of the top 20 sources of industrial pollution, eight are 
slaughterhouses (Hamerschlag 2011; EPA 2009). In addition, 
the country’s Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs) 
produced 500 million tonnes of manure in 2007: three times the 
United States’ 2007 total amount of human waste (Hamerschlag 
2011; EPA 2009). A further problem from centralized meat 
production facilities involves how bacteria convert excess nitrate 
in such waste into nitrous oxide, a potent greenhouse gas, or it 
can leach into waterways and groundwater (Wallinga 2009).

Generating intense pressures 
Drivers of environmental change are growing, evolving and 
combining at such an accelerating pace, at such a large scale and 
with such widespread reach that they are exerting unprecedented 
pressure on the environment. Most forms of consumption and 
production use the environment as a source of raw materials 

Drivers 23

Box 1.4 Information and communication technologies: a vicious cycle? 

Democratic Republic of Congo
The rising pace and scale of drivers of environmental change 
are related to the process of globalization, which has 
enhanced the rapidity and reach with which people, ideas, 
and technologies move. The explosive demand for mobile 
telephones and the resources with which they are made has 
concentrated impacts in producing countries. Since 1994, 
more than 10 billion mobile telephones have been produced, 
and as of mid-2010, there were an estimated 5 billion users 
worldwide (ITU 2010). This growth has led to an accelerating 
demand for tantalum, extracted from coltan ore, a key 
component of consumer electronics. Most coltan is mined 
in Australia, but approximately 8–9 per cent of the global 
coltan supply comes from the eastern Democratic Republic of 
the Congo (DRC) (Global Witness 2010). The environmental 
impacts are likely to be significant for a number of reasons: 
among other things, illegal mining operations are carried out 
with few environmental safeguards, often within the borders 
of national parks; land clearance and pollution from the mines 
contribute to erosion and the degradation of streams and water 
tables; and mining operations typically lead to an increase in 
poaching and the local bushmeat trade, threatening wildlife 
(Hayes 2002). In addition, since most mining operations in 
the eastern DRC are outside government control, lucrative 
revenues from the extraction and trade in coltan and other 
minerals have often been used to finance violence and other 
human rights violations.

Pearl River basin, China
In 2008, a quarter of the world’s electronic equipment was 
manufactured in China and more specifically in the Pearl 
River basin of southern China (Yunjie et al. 2010). China’s 
GDP growth was 9 per cent in 2009, while the Guangdong 
region of the basin exhibited growth levels 2–3 percentage 
points above national averages (World Bank 2011e). In the 
past decade, the region constituted one-fifth of China’s area, 
contained a third of its population and produced 40 per cent 
of national GDP (Barak 2009). The environmental impact 
of this economic growth has been poorly monitored, with 
estimates of tens of thousands of tonnes of heavy metals, 
nitrates and fuel being dumped untreated into the ocean each 
year (AsiaNews 2005). Without better coordination of water 
treatment, farmers have suffered severe crop losses from 

using the heavily polluted water for irrigation. The information 
technology industry has been blamed for much of the heavy 
metal dumped in the region, with the Pearl River basin named 
the most polluted river system in the country in 2004 and 
2005 (Xu 2010).

Agbogbloshie, Ghana
A huge dumping site for electronic waste is located in the 
suburbs of Ghana’s capital city, Accra. The Agbogbloshie slum, 
populated by domestic migrants from the northern reaches of 
Ghana, has witnessed an explosion of discarded computers, 
screens, hard drives and mobile telephones over the last 
ten years. What was once a productive wetland has become 
a hazardous chemical zone, home to approximately 40,000 
people (Safo 2011). The local economy depends on recycling 
this waste, with the majority of the workforce young boys aged 
11–18 earning roughly US$8 per day. The sources of much 
of this waste appear to be Parties to the Basel Convention, 
although a significant proportion also seems to come from the 
United States, which along with only Afghanistan and Haiti has 
not signed this treaty. 

To date there has been little study of the effects of this trade, 
but toxins have been discovered in soil and food samples due 
to chemicals accumulating in the food chain (Dogbevi 2011; 
Monbiot 2011), and the local toll could be considerable. 
Exposure to chemical fumes can inhibit development of the 
reproductive and nervous systems, particularly in children 
with high lead levels, while mercury, cadmium and lead may 
all retard the cognitive and immunological development of 
the young workforce. The story of Abogbloshie gives an initial 
snapshot of the very real, localized environmental and health 
impacts of rapidly emerging global phenomena such as the 
shift to information technology – replete with its disposable 
approach to obsolete equipment. It is a cautionary tale of 
how technological innovation can have both an extraordinary 
effect on the global economy and society itself while, nearly 
invisibly, wreaking havoc on the more vulnerable, especially 
where the necessary institutional oversight is absent. It is this 
disconnection between the global and local that the current 
economic paradigm has created, and researchers must work 
backwards through the supply chain if the present situation is 
to be understood.

and as a sink for wastes. The impacts can be highly concentrated 
in some parts of the world – such as nuclear waste storage 
facilities and residual accumulation of toxic compounds at 
e-waste recycling sites (Box 1.4) – or systemically spread over 
the entire globe – such as PCBs delivered along the food chain 
from equator to poles – and they can quickly create new and 
potentially dangerous situations. In many instances their impacts 
can be so deep, rapid and unpredictable that they risk exceeding 

environmental thresholds and societal capacity to monitor them 
or respond adequately.

The combination and scale of some drivers can create dynamic 
patterns that, in turn, generate complex systemic interactions. 
One example is the rise in greenhouse gas emissions, the scale of 
which has defied global efforts to stimulate the necessary action 
to stem emissions. In addition to rising global temperatures and 

24

Part 1: State and Trends

sea levels, scientists predict that the pace and scale of climate 
change could eventually exceed certain ecological limits or 
thresholds, leading to surprising and dangerous consequences 
such as the alteration of the world ocean’s chemical composition 
with increasing proportions of acidifying carbon, the global loss 
of coral reef ecosystems, or the collapse of the West Antarctic ice 
sheet (Fabry et al. 2008; Lenton et al. 2008). 

One driver can trigger a series of drivers and pressures that 
act in a domino fashion. For example, concerns about climate 
change impacts, including crop vulnerability and food insecurity, 
gave rise to policies that included mandates to increase biofuel 
production, such as legislation introduced in 2003 in the EU and 
in 2008 in the United States. The resulting demand generated a 
cascading set of pressures including crop diversion to biofuels. 
This diversion of cropland then contributed to higher food prices 
in 2008 and 2010, increasing worries about food insecurity.

Inertia and path dependencies
As global ecological and institutional systems are extremely 
complex and slow to change, decisions made today have long-
term and far-reaching impacts. Without addressing the drivers 
behind the current trajectory, it will be difficult to move to an 
environmentally sustainable suite of choices and outcomes. 
At the same time the need for urgency must be recognized. 
Finally, due to the inertia in the system and an unwillingness 
to address these drivers in the past, future generations are 
committed to a range of impacts that could have been avoided. 
The most daunting of these problems is climate change, where 
a coalescing of several drivers has made reducing carbon 
emissions a very complicated task. For instance, current 
fossil-fuel-dependent energy and transport infrastructures are 
estimated to have committed the planet to emitting 496 billion 
tonnes of CO2 from now until 2060 (Davis et al. 2010). These 
calculations do not include currently uncommitted transport 
network extensions, additional fossil-fuel-based power plants 
or the complex economy of refuelling stations or factories 
dependent on combustion energy, all of which are entirely reliant 
on the current model of energy generation and transport. The 
issue is not solely about the existing physical infrastructure that 
would be costly to replace, but the millions of jobs, processing 
facilities and entire sub-industries that have developed as a 
result of the status quo. 

The case for investments in transport infrastructure has been 
made before. However, the institutionalization of global food 
production offers similar barriers to change. United States farm 
policy provides an illustrative example of this phenomenon, 
although it is by no means the only country where it occurs. 
Currently, 74 per cent of agricultural land in the United States 
is dedicated to eight commodity crops: maize, wheat, cotton, 
soybeans, rice, barley, oats and sorghum, supported by 70–80 
per cent of government agricultural subsidies (Jackson et al. 
2009), while the farming industry has consolidated to become 
an industrialized food production system. Unfortunately, the 
emphasis on producing these eight crop commodities has 
resulted in a food system where healthier food options, such as 

vegetables and fruits, increased in price by more than 100 per cent 
between 1985 and 2000, while the price of unhealthy fats and 
oils derived from these basic foodstuffs rose by only 35 per cent 
(Jackson et al. 2009). With many of the country’s consumers 
making daily consumption decisions based on cost, decades of 
investment in this vertically integrated and politically powerful 
industry make fundamental changes in the health outcomes of 
the food system extremely challenging. 

However, not all health effects are diet related, but can be linked 
to such atmospheric pollution as nitrate formation and chemical 
pollution resulting from enhanced pesticide use, amongst other 
sources. For instance, in the United States, a high proportion of 
maize and soybean crops are genetically modified to resist the 
effects of the herbicide glyphosate, applied in vast quantities to 
eradicate weeds. Within the supply chain, maize and soy make 
up 83–91 per cent of livestock feed grains. Ongoing research 
raises the question of the endocrine-disrupting potential of 
glyphosate (Daniel and Margareta 2009; Gasnier et al. 2009). 
The residence time of glyphosate in the environment is difficult 
to model, as it is dependent on a number of biophysical factors 
(Vereecken 2005) and monitoring capability is only recently 
catching up with its widespread use. However, in communities 
located near agricultural fields, evidence of glyphosate and its 
most common degradate aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) 
can be found in the atmosphere, rain and local water bodies 
(Chang et al. 2011).

Focus on causes, rather than effects. It has not 
conventionally been popular to think about drivers – the 
causes – as a focus for environmental policy. Rather, policy 
responses typically concentrate on reducing pressures – the 
effects. There are, however, two compelling reasons to take a 
fresh look at drivers as an appropriate focus for policy. Firstly, 
unprecedented rates of change are being experienced and 
even where coping with one set of pressures is successful, 
others are around the corner. Secondly the global community 
has embraced a set of international environmental goals that 
are designed to tackle the drivers of environmental change 
more directly than previous efforts. The major legal agreements 
of the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and 
Development – on climate change, biodiversity and land 
degradation – recognize that long-term progress requires an 
ability to manage the evolution of underlying drivers. A relevant 
set of insights is available, providing policy makers with a 
menu of leverage points from which to choose driver-focused 
options for managing environmental problems.  

The relationship between human well-being and 
environmental sustainability is synergistic. MDG 1 to end 
poverty and hunger, MDG 2 to achieve universal education, and 
MDGs 3–5 on gender equality and child and maternal health 
are all synergistic with MDG 7 on environmental sustainability. 
For example, approximately three-quarters of all human land 
use is for meat and dairy production. Red meat is several times 
more demanding of land and water than poultry or vegetarian 
foods, and is also linked to cancer and heart disease. Policies 
encouraging lower consumption of red meat would contribute 
to the MDGs related to human health and environmental 
sustainability. Similarly, universal education and enhanced 
gender equality are mutually synergistic. Improvement in both 
of these areas increases demand for maternal and child health 
services, reducing unwanted births which in turn reduces 
population impacts on the environment.

Part 1: State and Trends

Indirect interventions can go a long way. Sometimes policy 
interventions targeted directly at drivers are not practical. Policies 
that set specific targets for population growth, for example, are 
seldom politically viable and have been called into question 
on moral and humanitarian grounds. However, there are often 
policy options that can reduce a driver indirectly in ways that are 
more acceptable. Fertility rates, for example, have been shown 
to be very responsive to levels of women’s education and to 
access to family planning programmes, consistent with two key 
MDGs as well as imperatives of ethical human justice. 

Direct interventions can be targeted at many different 
entry points. Even where indirect interventions are not 
practical, the fully disaggregated representation of key 
drivers opens up opportunities for effective intervention. For 
example, economic growth is generally considered a positive 
outcome across the world, so policies aimed at reducing 
growth, whether directly or indirectly, are not well received. 
However, that does not mean that driver-oriented policies are 
impossible. In China, for example, recognition of the problems 
associated with growth has led to ambitious targets aimed at 
energy efficiency. 

Unintended consequences matter. Policies intended to 
bring about improvement in one environmental domain may 
result in unintended consequences in another. Negative 
consequences may take the form of cross-systemic links, the 
effects on food security of biofuel promotion, for example, 
or of path dependence such as policies that favour one 
type of infrastructure and make a switch to more favourable 
infrastructures more difficult. Policy makers seeking to manage 
drivers need to find ways of designing policies to minimize 
such negative consequences. 

Even intractable drivers can be reframed. A core tenet of 
conflict resolution is to break down seemingly intractable 
elements into separate parts, which can then be subject to 
effective bargaining. Recent discussions around alternative 
measures of well-being have elements in common with this. 
Whereas GDP per person is treated as a proxy for well-being 
and as a universal policy objective, recent explorations have 
promoted alternative formulations where GDP is analytically 
separated from well-being. This opens up investigations into a 
broader range of proxies for well-being that could be pursued. 

Surveillance and monitoring get results. Even where policy 
responses are not immediately possible, awareness of the 
importance of drivers justifies increased surveillance and 
monitoring. Many of the most important drivers are currently 
not subject to systematic monitoring, their impacts even less 
so. The evidence, then, is compelling for the need to enhance 
the collection and monitoring of anthropogenic drivers and 
their links with the environment.

Main Messages 

The global atmosphere is at a critical stage, 
particularly in relation to climate change. There 
is considerable scientific evidence of the causes 
and solutions that could protect human health and 
ecosystems, and effective action has resulted in the 
achievement of some internationally agreed goals. 
The phase-out of ozone-depleting substances and lead 
in petrol by implementing relatively simple and cost-
effective solutions demonstrates that, when most major 
stakeholders agree, significant progress is possible.

Progress in achieving environmental goals for 
particulate matter (PM) and tropospheric ozone 
is mixed, despite the high levels of concern about 
their impacts, as solutions are complex and can be 
costly. Much of the developed world has successfully 
reduced concentrations of indoor and outdoor PM, 
sulphur and nitrogen compounds to levels close 
to or within World Health Organization guidelines. 
However, more remains to be done. Concern is 
high in Africa, Asia and Latin America, where levels 
of PM in many cities remain far in excess of the 
guidelines. Existing solutions can be relatively 
costly and the time it will take to meet guideline or 
target concentrations will depend on the priority 
given to the issue. Tropospheric ozone also remains 
a significant problem and is proving difficult to 
address despite some progress with regard to peak 
concentrations in Europe and North America.

Climate change is the most important atmospheric 
issue. While there is considerable concern about 
this complex problem, progress has been slow due 
to varying levels of motivation and because some 
low-carbon technological solutions are considered 
expensive. Despite attempts to develop low-carbon 
economies in a number of countries, atmospheric 
concentrations of greenhouse gases continue to 
increase to levels likely to push global temperatures 
beyond the internationally agreed limit of 2°C above 
the pre-industrial average temperature. Application 
of current low-carbon technologies and existing

policy options would reduce the risks posed by 
climate change, but a gap of several billion tonnes 
of carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalent remains between 
present emission reduction pledges and those 
necessary to reach climate targets.

Complementary strategies to address short-lived 
climate forcers (SLCFs) – black carbon, methane 
and tropospheric ozone – could, if implemented 
widely, significantly reduce the rate of temperature 
increase in the near term while delivering 
substantial co-benefits for human health and food 
security. Given that policy tools and technological 
solutions already exist, progress in reducing SLCFs 
could be rapid. Nevertheless, this has to be seen 
as a complementary strategy to the reductions in 
anthropogenic CO2 emissions necessary to protect 
the Earth from exceeding the 2°C limit. 

Climate change, air quality and stratospheric ozone 
depletion are increasingly seen as closely related 
issues but governments are not addressing them 
in an integrated manner. An integrated approach 
to atmospheric protection could support economic 
development and, by addressing key sectors, policy 
makers could accomplish multiple goals. Addressing 
sources of pollution can affect the different gases 
and particles they emit and deliver multiple climate 
and air quality benefits. The challenge is to find 
those solutions that maximize the benefits and lend 
themselves to widespread implementation. 

Investment in achieving atmospheric goals is 
expected to be cost-effective. The benefits of these 
policies include reducing anthropogenic radiative 
forcing, saving millions of lives and significantly 
enhancing quality of life. Achievement of these 
benefits and climate and air quality goals requires 
widespread implementation of currently available 
technology and proven policy – but it is likely that 
transformative changes affecting major drivers of 
emissions are required as well.

INTRODUCTION
Substances emitted to the atmosphere as a result of human 
activities are a challenge to both the environment and 
development: millions of people die prematurely each year from 
indoor and outdoor air pollution; ozone-depleting substances 
(ODS) have thinned the ozone layer and created seasonal holes 
in the stratospheric ozone layer over polar regions; and climate 
change is happening now, and atmospheric concentrations 
of greenhouse gases and other substances that affect climate 
continue to increase. Climate change threatens, amongst other 
things, food security and biodiversity, and it is likely to increase 
storm damage on all parts of the globe. People in many of the 
developing regions are especially vulnerable.

These atmospheric issues are addressed by several global 
and regional agreements including Agenda 21 (UNCED 1992) 
and the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation (WSSD 2002). 
Internationally agreed goals and, in some cases, targets have 
been established. In addition, there are some internationally 
agreed guidelines related to human health and ecosystems that 
are used to monitor progress in addressing atmospheric issues. 

This chapter uses key indicators to assess progress in relation 
to goals set at global and regional levels for atmospheric issues. 
It considers whether progress is on track to achieve these goals 
using existing policies and measures, and whether they are 
sufficient to address the key issues important to human well-

being and development. The chapter then considers the outlook 
for the different issues and what more needs to be done. Where 
existing policies fall short, the need for more transformative 
change is highlighted, a concept that is expanded in Chapter 16.

The scientific basis for the development of air pollution policy 
has greatly improved and there is increasing understanding of 
the socio-economic aspects of atmospheric issues (Stern 2007). 
Recently, science has pointed to new challenges such as near-term 
climate change and short-lived climate forcers (SLCFs) (Shindell 
et al. 2012; UNEP and WMO 2011), and knowledge about 
thresholds and tipping points has improved (Lenton et al. 2008). 

Climate change, air quality and stratospheric ozone depletion 
are closely related, as individual pollutants can have multiple 
impacts on health, crop yields, ecosystems, cooling or heating 
of the atmosphere and stratospheric ozone depletion, all with 
the potential to affect human well-being (Figure 2.1). Many 
sources also emit multiple pollutants that can both affect air 
quality and cause climate change. Yet, despite these links, most 
governments address these issues separately, in part because 
goals were set in this way 20 years ago. Depending on which 
measures are implemented, there could be co-beneficial or 
antagonistic outcomes and, unless a more integrated approach 
is developed, there is a risk that different atmospheric policies 
could work against each other. 

INTERNATIONAL GOALS AND TARGETS
Major goals to protect the environment and human well-being 
from the impact of substances emitted to the atmosphere were 
established in Agenda 21 (UNCED 1992) and the Johannesburg 
Plan of Implementation (WSSD 2002). These emphasized the 
need to identify threshold levels of pollutants and greenhouse 
gases that cause “dangerous anthropogenic interference with 
the climatic system and environment” (Agenda 21 Chapter 9). 
Meeting the objectives to phase out chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) 
and other ozone-depleting substances – as defined in the 1985 
Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer (UNEP 
1985) and its 1987 Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete 
the Ozone Layer (UNEP 1987) – was considered essential. These 
also recognized the importance of the 1979 Convention on Long-
Range Transboundary Air Pollution (CLRTAP) and its protocols 
to reduce regional air pollution, and recommended that these 
programmes be continued and enhanced, and their experience 
shared with other regions. 

The Johannesburg Plan of Implementation went on to consider 
air quality as a part of overall development, promoting an 
integrated approach to policy making. It stressed the need to 
reduce respiratory diseases and other health impacts resulting 
from air pollution, paying particular attention to women and 
children. It supported the phasing out of lead in petrol, measures 
to prevent children’s exposure to lead, and efforts to strengthen 
the monitoring, surveillance and treatment of lead poisoning. 
Another focus was to assist developing countries in providing 
affordable energy to rural communities, particularly to reduce 
dependence on traditional fuels for cooking and heating.

Atmospheric issues are closely linked to the Millennium 
Development Goals (MDGs) (UN 2000), as shown in Table 2.1. 
Other non-atmosphere-related conventions such as the 1992 
Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) also have links with  
the impacts of atmospheric pollution. The Aichi Biodiversity 
Targets (CBD 2010a) include two atmosphere-related targets: 
•	 Target	8:	by	2020,	pollution,	including	from	excess	nutrients,	

will have been brought to levels that are not detrimental to 
ecosystem function and biodiversity; and 

•	 Target	10:	by	2015,	the	multiple	anthropogenic	pressures	
on coral reefs, and other vulnerable ecosystems impacted 
by climate change or ocean acidification will have been 
minimized, so as to maintain their integrity and functioning. 

Atmospheric goals and targets are supported by both legally 
and non-legally binding environmental agreements (Table 2.2), 

most of which contain globally agreed quantitative targets 
and timelines for implementation that have catalysed the 
development and implementation of national regulation. 
The goals and targets refer to different aspects of control, 
including:
•	 control	of	drivers,	for	example	the	total	ban	–	with	a	few	

exceptions – of the production and consumption of ozone-
depleting substances, and the phase-out of leaded petrol; 

•	 reducing	pressures,	for	example	emission	reductions	of	
carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases; and 

•	 targeting	concentrations	of,	for	example,	particulate	matter	

(PM) and CO2.

For outdoor and indoor air pollution there are no global 
targets as such, but the World Health Organization (WHO) has 
established air quality guidelines, based on scientific research,

to help assess progress towards reducing risks from air 
pollution (WHO 2006). The limit for global temperature increase 
at the end of the century – the agreed 2oC limit – was set on the 
basis of scientific discussion of the potential impacts, but also 
political realities and the likelihood that it could be achieved 
(Hare et al. 2011). Countries set national air-quality standards 
and even greenhouse gas commitments or targets specific to 
their international obligations, development situation and 
institutional capacities. The Copenhagen Accord (UNFCCC 
2009) invited developed countries to submit economy-wide 
emission reduction targets for 2020 and developing countries 

to submit nationally appropriate mitigation actions (NAMAs). 
The Cancun Agreements (UNFCCC 2010) legally recognized 
these pledged targets and actions, formally anchoring them in 
the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 
(UNFCCC). The CLRTAP remains the only regional agreement on 
transboundary air pollution that sets targets for many different 
pollutants. Some regions, and sub-regions – Africa, Asia and 
South America – have cooperation agreements that show intent 
to reduce emissions, but these are not binding, and in some 
cases have not been implemented due to lack of human and 
financial resources.

PROGRESS IN ACHIEVING ATMOSPHERIC GOALS
This section examines progress in addressing concerns about 
the atmosphere over the 20 years or so since Agenda 21 (UNCED 
1992) identified key priorities. The goals and targets set globally 
and regionally for a number of atmospheric issues are compared 
to the current situation, examining whether they have been met 
and determining the size of the gap between the current situation 
and the goals and targets. 

Progress is described against key indicators by considering 
atmospheric issues in three main categories: 
•	 examples	of	where	targets	are	not	being	met	and	the	

situation remains far from sustainable; 

•	 examples	of	mixed	progress,	with	some	regions	having	met	

targets and others remaining far from them; and

•	 examples	of	good	progress,	where	targets	have	been	set	and	

are largely met.

Climate change: goals far from being met
There is broad scientific consensus that anthropogenic emissions 
of CO2 and other greenhouse gases are the leading cause of 
contemporary climatic changes (IPCC 2007). Four independent 
analyses show that 2000–2009 was the warmest decade on record 
with atmospheric concentrations of CO2 also increasing (Figure 2.2). 
A look at regional temperature changes shows that the greatest 
warming over the past century is at high latitudes (Figure 2.3). 

Climate change threatens human well-being in many ways, from 
a greater frequency of heat waves and severe storms, to shifts in 
rainfall patterns and rising sea levels (IPCC 2007). Changes in the 
frequency of tropical cyclones are uncertain, but it is likely that 
their intensity will increase with rising temperatures (IPCC 2011). 

Humans are directly affected, for example through alterations 
in freshwater supply, agricultural productivity and health, 
and indirectly by the economic and social impacts of loss of 
biodiversity and ecosystem services. Climate change is therefore

economics literature suggests that damage from climate impacts 
could amount annually to 1–2 per cent of world gross domestic 
product (GDP) by 2100 if temperatures increase by 2.5oC above 
pre-industrial levels. These damage estimates rise to 2–4 per 
cent of world GDP for a 4oC increase (Aldy et al. 2010). The few 
studies that estimate damages for extreme warming find that 
annual losses to world GDP by 2100 could range from  
10.2 per cent for a 6oC warming increase (Nordhaus and Boyer 
2000) to 11.3 per cent for a 7.4oC warming increase (Stern 2007). 
While valuation is sensitive to underlying assumptions about 
discount rates and catastrophic effects, it is clear that the  
socio-economic impacts of climate change are likely to be very 
large.

Impacts will probably be especially significant in the Arctic 
where warming is likely to be the greatest. Large portions of the 
Arctic have experienced temperature increases of more than 2oC 
compared to 1890–1910 (Figure 2.3), and Arctic sea ice cover has 
decreased dramatically, with declines in both the autumn and the 
winter (Figure 2.4). The Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets both 
show rapidly increasing melt rates and the Greenland melt area 
has expanded markedly (Rignot et al. 2011). Other areas where 
sizeable climate change impacts are projected include the sub-
tropics, where arid regions are expected to expand, and low-lying 
areas, where sea-level rise is likely to cause the most damage. Less 
developed countries that have limited capacity to adapt to these 
changes are at risk of not meeting their development goals. 

Extreme weather events are expected to change in frequency 
and intensity, becoming more common as the climate warms, 
including regional heat waves and both wet and dry extremes 
of precipitation (IPCC 2007). Europe experienced two extremely 
hot summers in 2003 and 2010, and research shows that the 
probability of extreme summer heat, including mega-heat 
waves, will increase by a factor of 5–10 within the next 40 years 
(Barriopedro et al. 2011). The frequency of heavy precipitation 
events has increased over most of the world’s land area (Chapter 
4), and more intense and longer droughts have been observed 
since the 1970s, particularly in the tropics and sub-tropics 
(IPCC 2007). Long-term trends show a tendency towards drier 
conditions in the Sahel and northern India (Figure 2.5).

There is growing concern that inaction will lead to changes that 
are irreversible at human timescales – so-called tipping points. 
Increased release of carbon stored in permafrost, as CO2 or 

methane, is an example of a change that could give rise to a cycle 
of further warming and further releases of greenhouse gases 
(Schaefer et al. 2011; Lawrence and Slater 2005).

Concentrations and emissions of most anthropogenic 
greenhouse gases have increased during recent years 
(Table 2.3 and Figure 2.6). Growth rates have been especially 
high for concentrations of several hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) 
while emissions of CO2 from fossil fuel consumption have 
followed the more pessimistic of the widely used projections 

of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special 
Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES) (IPCC 2000) during the  
last decade, despite a brief downturn in global emissions in 
2009 associated with the economic recession (Figure 2.6). 
The rapid growth of CO2 concentrations is also associated with 
similarly rapid increases in ocean acidification (Chapter 4).

Asian rainfall, May-September, 1960-1998

To avoid exceeding the 450 ppm atmospheric concentrations 
of CO2-equivalent that are likely to be required to stay within 
the temperature rise limit of 2oC, the IPCC has concluded that 
developed countries need to reduce emissions by 25–40 per cent 
below 1990 levels by 2020 (IPCC 2007), while peer-reviewed

literature has concluded that developing countries need to 
reduce emissions by 15–30 per cent relative to business-as-

usual by 2020 (den Elzen and Höhne 2010, 2008). Further 
reductions are then required beyond 2020 to achieve the target. 
While some countries have reduced CO2 emissions since the 
Kyoto Protocol entered into force in 2005, many appear unlikely 
to reach their Kyoto targets. Further, many of the same countries 
reporting reductions have increased imports of carbon-intensive 
products – so-called carbon leakage. Accounting for the foreign 
CO2 emissions embedded within imported products, emissions 
have in fact increased in many developed nations and the net 
domestic-plus-embedded emissions are far greater than the 
Kyoto targets (Peters et al. 2011a).

The years since the Bali Action Plan (UNFCCC 2008) have  
seen 42 developed countries pledge quantified economy-wide 
emission targets up to 2020, while 44 developing countries 
have pledged nationally appropriate mitigation actions. 
Nonetheless, these commitments fall short – by about 6 billion 
tonnes of CO2-equivalent – of levels likely to keep temperatures 
within safe limits as shown in Figure 2.7. This figure compares 
the expected emissions in 2020, resulting from four possible 
interpretations of pledges of mitigation action from  
86 countries, with the range of emission levels that would 
providea greater than 66 per cent chance of staying below the 
agreed 2oC temperature rise limit. The gap between expected 
emissions and the agreed UNFCCC 2oC limit lies between 
6 billion and 11 billion tonnes of CO2-equivalent. The size 
of the gap depends on the extent to which the pledges are 
implemented and how they are applied (UNEP 2011a).

An historical tendency to underestimate rates of climate change 
suggests that non-linear changes and material losses at the 
higher end of estimated ranges are also possible (Smith et al. 
2009; Stern 2007). Overall, prospects for long-term climate 
change look bleak if there is no demonstrable progress at both 
international and national levels.

Even if negotiations take longer than expected at the 
international level, national actions should continue to move 

forward. A growing body of low-carbon research has shown that 
in countries ranging from the United Kingdom (Strachan et al. 
2008) and Japan (Fujino et al. 2008) to Thailand (Shrestha et 
al. 2008), it would be economically and technically feasible to 
cut emissions in half by 2050. The results of these studies are 
based on placing a price on carbon through, for instance, an 
emissions trading scheme. It is important to note, however, that 
market-based instruments such as emissions trading schemes 
or the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) may not work in all

contexts or benefit all regions equally. For example, in the CDM 
market, Latin America and Asia and the Pacific account for more 
than 87 per cent of all projects while Africa accounts for less than 
3 per cent (UNFCCC 2012). 

Other studies suggest that mainstreaming climate change  
into existing development plans could provide a more 
promising alternative to market-based instruments, especially 
for those developing countries that constrain their development 
with an emissions cap (Shukla et al. 2008). This is reinforced  
by research that shows that because of the relatively greater 
value of co-benefits, such as improved local air quality, 
low-income countries have the most to gain from mitigating 
greenhouse gases in a manner consistent with development 
priorities (Nemet et al. 2010). Capturing these co-benefits 
not only requires that policy makers become adept at 
mainstreaming climate change in development plans, but 
also necessitates decision-making frameworks that explicitly 
acknowledge synergies between climate change and other 
atmospheric issues. Such an integrated approach can readily 
be put in place at local and city levels, where a considerable 
amount of climate mitigation and air quality control has already 
been implemented.

Mixed progress 
There are examples of improvement in some regions while large 
difficulties remain in many others, and global targets are still far 
from being met. Four major atmospheric issues are described 
below: sulphur, nitrogen, small particulate matter (typically 
described as PM10 and PM2.5) and tropospheric ozone.

Sulphur pollution 
Sulphur dioxide (SO2) emissions, predominantly from fossil 
fuel use in power generation, industry and transport, have 
detrimental effects on human health by contributing to PM2.5,  
on terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems by acidification (Rodhe 
et al. 1995), on man-made materials and cultural heritage by 
corrosion (Kucera et al. 2007), and on biodiversity (Bobbink et 
al. 1998) and forestry (Menz and Seip 2004). Sulphate aerosols 
also cool the atmosphere (Forster et al. 2007), which makes it 
important to track them in order to assess the overall benefits of 
greenhouse gas reduction strategies. 

Since issues of transboundary air pollution were highlighted 
in Agenda 21 (UNCED 1992) there have been considerable

reductions in sulphur dioxide emissions in Europe and North 
America, achieving the targets of the CLRTAP protocols, the 
National Emission Ceiling (NEC) Directives of the European 
Union (EU) and clean air legislation in Canada and the United 
States (Figure 2.8). Key to the development of country targets 
in Europe was the use of critical loads (deposition thresholds 
above which harmful effects are observed) (Nilsson and 
Grennfelt 1988). Successful implementation of legislation 
brought about a drop of around 20 per cent in global emissions 
between 1980 and 2000. Emissions from Europe and North 
America were dominant until about 2000, when East Asian 
emissions started to dominate. According to the Representative 
Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios (Figure 2.8), global 
sulphur dioxide emissions were projected to decline steadily 
after 2005, and by 2050 to be 30, 50 or 70 per cent lower than 
2000 levels. This set of four new pathways was developed for 
the climate modelling community as a basis for near- and  
long-term modelling experiments (van Vuuren et al. 2011; 
Moss et al. 2010). 

As sulphur deposition has abated in Europe and North America, 
acidification has also diminished and some freshwater 
ecosystems have recovered, although critical loads are still 
exceeded in some areas (Wright et al. 2005; Stoddard et al. 1999). 
In Asia, the increase in emissions has put sensitive ecosystems at 
risk from the effects of soil acidification (Figure 2.9). However, the 
large-scale acidification of natural lakes experienced in Europe 
and North America has not been seen in Asia, and may be unlikely 
due to the nature of the region’s soil and geology (Hicks et al. 
2008). In 2005 it was estimated that the critical load for soils in 
China was exceeded by sulphur deposition across 28 per cent of 
the country’s territory, mainly in eastern and south-central China. 
The area in exceedance is projected to decrease to 20 per cent 
in 2020, given the implementation of current plans for emission 
reductions (Zhao et al. 2009).

Further action on sulphur emissions is being taken through the 
revision of the Gothenburg Protocol in Europe. In Asia, action 
is also being taken to improve the efficiency of energy use and 
reduce sulphur dioxide emissions. For example, as part of its 
five-year plans, China implemented flue-gas desulphurization 
and the phasing out of small, inefficient units in the power 
sector in a move to achieve the national goal of a 10 per cent 
reduction in sulphur dioxide emissions between 2005 and 2010 
(Zhang 2010). 

Global efforts are also being made to reduce sulphur emissions 
from key sectors, including transport and shipping. The human 
health effects of particulate matter measuring 2.5 micrometres 
or less in diameter (PM2.5) are being tackled by lowering the 
sulphur content of diesel fuels – for example, UNEP’s Partnership 
for Clean Fuels and Vehicles (PCFV) is promoting the reduction 
of sulphur in vehicle fuels to 50ppm or below worldwide 
(UNEP 2012). Sulphur emissions from shipping have become 
an important policy issue in Europe, while the International 
Convention for the Prevention of Marine Pollution from Ships 
(MARPOL) is committed to the progressive global reduction in

which would be associated with a reduction in soil pH. Below a base saturation 
of (cid:18)(cid:17)%, more serious impacts of acidiﬁcation can occur (such as increases in 
soil water aluminium which is toxic to plant roots). The projections are based 
on emissions according to the IPCC SRES A(cid:18) scenario for (cid:18)(cid:17)(cid:15)(cid:17).

benefit to crop yields, and can increase carbon sequestration 
through the stimulation of forest growth (ENA 2011).

Nitrogen compounds
Human activity linked to energy use and food production has 
more than doubled the amount of reactive nitrogen circulating in 
the environment over the past century (ENA 2011). This is emitted 
to the atmosphere as nitrogen oxides (NOX), mainly from the 
transport and industry sectors, and ammonia (NH3) and nitrous 
oxide (N2O), mainly from agriculture. They have multiple effects 
on the atmosphere, terrestrial ecosystems, freshwater and marine 
systems, and on human health, a phenomenon known as the 
nitrogen cascade (Galloway et al. 2003). Nitrogen compounds 
are precursors of atmospheric PM2.5, which has impacts on 
human health, while nitrogen oxide is a precursor of tropospheric 
ozone, which has impacts on health, crop yields, ecosystems and 
climate. Nitrous oxide and tropospheric ozone are also important 
greenhouse gases. Nitrogen deposition drives biodiversity loss 
through eutrophication and acidification in terrestrial and aquatic 
ecosystems (Bobbink et al. 1998). However, it can also be of

Total global nitrogen oxide emissions increased until around 
2000, but were expected to remain more or less constant 
thereafter, with reductions in Europe and North America 
compensating for the growth in emissions in Asia and all other 
regions (Figure 2.10). Control measures in Europe – where 
road transport accounted for 40 per cent of emissions in 2005 
– succeeded in reducing total nitrogen oxide emissions by 32 
per cent between 1990 and 2005 (Vestreng et al. 2009), while 
measures in the United States reduced emissions by 36 per cent 
between 1990 and 2008 (IJC 2010). In Asia, emissions have 
continued to increase over the past two decades, with the growth 
rate itself accelerating during this period (Figure 2.10). Emissions 
from international shipping are estimated to have risen from 16 
million tonnes in 2000 to 20 million tonnes of nitrogen dioxide 
(NO2) in 2007 (IMO 2009). 

Global ammonia emissions, largely from the agricultural 
sector, have increased fivefold since the middle of the last 
century and are projected to continue to climb in all regions 
with the possible exception of Europe, where they have 
decreased slightly and may stabilize (Figure 2.10) (EEA 2009). 
Nevertheless, there is a lack of concern and focus on this 
issue in Europe, and there is often resistance to major changes 
from the farming community. In most other regions ammonia 
is not regulated under major emission control laws. However, 
the Gothenburg Protocol of CLRTAP is being revised with more 
stringent targets and is likely to lead to a further reduction in 
emissions in Europe. 

Despite these improvements, nitrogen-based air pollution 
from agriculture, industry and traffic in urban areas contributes 
significantly to PM2.5 concentrations as secondary nitrate and 
ammonium particles, which are reducing people’s life expectancy 
by several months across much of Central Europe (ENA 2011).

In Africa, Asia and Latin America, where control of nitrogen 
emissions is not a high priority, projections show increases in 
emissions of both nitrogen oxides and ammonia (Figure 2.10). 
In some regions, especially in Africa, lack of monitoring capacity 
is a major issue. To address this, more policy emphasis on these 
substances in these regions will be required, especially with 
regard to emissions from the agricultural, energy, industrial and 
transport sectors, while ensuring that there is adequate nitrogen 
fertilizer available for food production. 

Current technology can deliver significant reductions in emissions 
of nitrogen oxide, but growth in certain sectors, particularly 
transport, can counteract control measures. Changed management 
practices will be needed to reduce ammonia emissions, and more 
fundamental consideration of agricultural policy and practice, 
as well as changes in consumption patterns of meat and dairy 
products, are required if large reductions are to be achieved.

Rising atmospheric nitrogen deposition will lead to environmental 
effects associated with the nitrogen cascade (Galloway et al. 
2003), including impacts on plant diversity. The Convention on 
Biological Diversity has recognized nitrogen deposition as an 
indicator of the threat to biodiversity (CBD 2010b) and especially 
to sensitive ecosystems that receive a total nitrogen deposition 
above 10 kg per hectare per year (Figure 2.11). However, the full 
impact is difficult to estimate as there is little quantification of the 
effects on biodiversity outside Europe and North America. 

Designing effective policies to balance the positive impacts 
of nitrogen deposition, such as increases in crop yields and 
carbon sequestration, and the negative impacts, such as loss of 
biodiversity and increased greenhouse gas emissions, underlines 
the necessity for a truly integrated approach to nitrogen 
management in the environment.

Particulate matter
Control of particulate matter has achieved mixed progress 
worldwide. In Europe and North America, as well as some cities 
in Latin America and Asia, emissions of PM10 – particles of 
10 micrometres in diameter or less – have been reduced, but 
they remain a major pollutant in many other cities in Asia and 
Latin America. Very few cities in Africa monitor air pollutants; 
however, of the few that do, many show PM10 concentrations in 
excess of WHO guidelines (WHO 2012). Outdoor concentrations 
in high-income countries come close to the WHO PM10 guideline  
of 20 micrograms per m3 (Figure 2.12). In Africa, the most 
widespread issue is indoor levels of particulates. Regulating these 
pollutants is complex because they are composed of a variable mix 

Box 2.4 Particulate matter

Indicators
PM levels

Global trends
Mixed progress in relation to WHO guidelines, with significant 
reductions in the EU and North America and some Latin 
American and Asian cities, but mostly high concentrations 
in urban areas in Asia and Latin America; data for Africa is 
insufficient, but some cities have high PM levels

of primary emissions and secondary pollutants, where the original 
emissions are transformed in the atmosphere. An additional 
challenge for cities is the elimination of particulate hotspots. 

Particulate matter, especially the finer PM2.5, is the most 
important air pollutant causing damage to human health 
(WHO 2011; Carnelley and Le 2001). The prime sources of 
particulate matter relate to the energy, transport and industry 
sectors, but open burning of solid waste and crop residues are 
also important sources. Health research worldwide has shown 
that there is no safe threshold for exposure, as even very low 
levels cause health damage (WHO 2006, 1999). Impacts on 
health are predominantly associated with respiratory and 
cardiovascular illnesses, but the range of effects is broad 
for both acute and chronic exposure. Based on exposures 
to particulate matter in 2004, WHO estimated that annually 
5.3 per cent of premature deaths worldwide, about 3.1 million 
people, are attributable to air pollution – 2 per cent to outdoor 
urban pollution and 3.3 per cent to indoor pollution – which is 
more than from all other environmental risks combined  
(Table 2.4) (WHO 2009). However, a more recent study estimated  
3.7 million premature deaths due to outdoor anthropogenic 
PM2.5 alone, as it used a different method that includes exposure 
in rural areas, does not have a low-concentration threshold, and 
used updated concentration-response relationships (Annenberg et 
al. 2010). Worldwide, approximately 41 million disability-adjusted 
life years (DALYs) – the sum of potential healthy life years lost 
due to illness – are attributed to solid fuel and methods use 
with about 18 million, or 44 per cent of the total, occurring in 
sub-Saharan Africa (UNDP and WHO 2009). Household energy

interventions, which reduce dependence on traditional fuels 
and methods for cooking and heating, clearly have the potential 
to improve health and promote achievement of the MDGs. Even 
in high-income countries such as the United Kingdom, PM2.5 is 
estimated to have contributed to 29 000 premature deaths and 
the loss of 340 000 life-years in 2008 (COMEAP 2010), despite 
considerable progress in reducing concentrations. 

Recent assessments of the long-range transport of air pollution 
indicate that intercontinental transport of particulate matter 
is contributing to exceedances of public health standards and 
visibility targets. Long-range transport of particulates may be 
responsible for 380 000 premature deaths worldwide, of which 
75 per cent are attributable to (mineral) dust PM2.5 (HTAP 2010). 
The impacts of air pollution from natural sources are an emerging 
atmospheric issue requiring attention, and will be discussed in 
the subsequent section on atmospheric governance.

Various measures, including technological improvements to 
vehicles, increased transport and energy efficiencies and cleaner 
fuels and filters, have been successful in developed countries 
and to some extent in developing ones. However, while the 
latter are catching up in the use of cleaner technologies, such 
efficiencies are being compromised by a rapid increase in 
emission sources, for example fuel use for energy and transport. 
Where indoor particulates are concerned, global partnerships are 
promoting cleaner energy and improved cooking stoves.

Most developed and developing countries have adopted 
ambient air quality standards (Figure 2.12), but concentrations 
of particulates in most cities exceed the levels recommended by 
WHO’s ambient air quality guidelines for protecting human health 
and ecosystems (Figure 2.13). Most of the PM10 standards in 
developing countries are less stringent than the interim targets set 
by WHO to promote a progressive reduction in air pollution. WHO 
has also recommended PM2.5 guidelines, but many countries have 
yet to adopt standards and monitoring practices. In Asia in 2010, 
for example, only four out of the 22 countries have standards for 

PM2.5 supported by monitoring. There is growing interest in the 
health impacts of micrometre and sub-micrometre particles,  
as discussed below in the section on emerging issues. 

Projections of a 20 per cent reduction in PM2.5 emissions by 2020 in 
Europe are expected to lead to a 40 per cent fall in the associated 
years of life lost compared to the year 2000; nonetheless, PM2.5 air 
pollution is still expected to shorten statistical life expectancy by  
4.6 months (Amann et al. 2011). However, if the new National 
Emission Ceilings in Europe are implemented the benefits will 
outweigh the costs 12–37 times depending on the valuation 
method (AEA 2010), and PM emissions could be reduced by  
35–50 per cent depending on the portfolio of measures. 
Meanwhile, the US Environmental Protection Agency reports that 
lowered levels of ambient PM2.5 and ozone due to the US Clean 
Air Act are projected to result in avoided mortalities valued at 
US$1.2 trillion in 2010 and US$1.8 trillion in 2020 (2006 dollars). 
Reductions in exposure to particulate matter account for more than 
90 per cent of these projected and realised benefits (USEPA 2010).

There are some uncertainties that need to be resolved to inform 
better policy making for particulate matter and health. These 
include the concentration and impact of particle sizes and a 
better understanding of the nature of primary and secondary PM 
pollution in different locations through monitoring, emission 
inventories and modelling, as well as through the use of source 
apportionment and estimation of the economic value of health 
impacts. Efforts to harmonize ambient air quality standards 
and the building of capacity have the potential to fast-track PM 
reduction in developing countries, amplifying the successful 
policies and technologies applied in Europe and North America 
and in some Asian and Latin American cities. 

Tropospheric and surface ozone
Tropospheric ozone (O3) in the lower atmosphere, from 0–10 up 
to 20 km above the Earth’s surface, is responsible for ozone’s 
impact on warming. Ground-level or surface ozone refers to 
concentrations at ground level that affect both human health and 
ecosystems. There is mixed progress in controlling tropospheric 
ozone: peak concentrations have decreased in Europe and North 
America, and North America, while background concentrations 
have increased. In rapidly industrializing regions both 
background and peak concentrations have been steadily rising 
(Royal Society 2008).

Ozone causes harm in three main ways. Firstly, surface ozone 
damages human health and its impact is considered second 
only to particulate matter. It is responsible for an estimated 
0.7 million respiratory deaths globally each year (Anenberg 
et al. 2010), more than 75 per cent of which are in Asia. Ozone

can also have chronic health effects resulting in permanent lung 
damage (Royal Society 2008). 

Secondly, surface ozone is the most important air pollutant 
causing damage to vegetation (Emberson et al. 2009; Ashmore 
2005), diminishing crop yields and forest productivity and 
altering net primary productivity. Estimates suggest, for 
example, that ozone-induced yield losses range between  
3 and 16 per cent for four staple crops – maize, wheat, soybean 
and rice – which translate into annual global economic losses 
of US$14–26 billion (HTAP 2010). 

Lastly, ozone is the third most important greenhouse gas after CO2 
and methane (IPCC 2007), but is classified as a short-lived climate 
forcer due to its residence time in the atmosphere of just days to 
weeks. Tropospheric ozone is estimated to have been responsible 
for a change in radiative forcing of +0.35 (-0.1, +0.3) watts per m2 
since pre-industrial times, compared to a combined anthropogenic 
radiative forcing of +1.6 (-1.0, +0.8) watts per m2 (IPCC 2007). 
These ozone-induced changes are thought to be responsible 
for 5–16 per cent of the global temperature change since pre-
industrial times (Forster et al. 2007). Reductions in biomass 
caused by ozone also influence the amount of carbon sequestered 
within terrestrial ecosystems. This effect is estimated to increase 
atmospheric CO2 concentrations such that the additional radiative 
forcing could exceed warming due to the direct radiative effect of 
tropospheric ozone in the atmosphere (Sitch et al. 2007). 

Ozone is not directly emitted into the atmosphere but rather is
formed when precursor pollutants – nitrogen oxides and volatile
organic compounds, including methane, and carbon monoxide –
react in the presence of sunlight. As such, ozone concentrations 
tend to be higher at some distance – tens to thousands of 
kilometres – downwind of precursor pollutant sources, causing 
ozone to pollute at the local, regional and hemispheric scale.

Photochemical reactions account for approximately 90 per cent 
of the ozone in the troposphere, with the remaining 10 per cent 
directly transported from the stratosphere. Around 30 per cent 
of tropospheric ozone is due to anthropogenic emissions, with 
40 per cent of the change in the global ozone burden since pre-

industrial times due to increases in methane, and the remainder 
to increases in emissions of nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide 
and volatile organic compounds other than methane (HTAP 
2010). The origin of ground-level or surface ozone relevant to 
effects on human health and ecosystems across the polluted 
regions of the northern hemisphere is 20–25 per cent from the 
stratosphere and a similar proportion from natural precursor 
sources including lightning and emissions from soils, vegetation 
and fire, along with oxidation of naturally occurring methane. The 
anthropogenic contribution thus typically exceeds 50 per cent 
over these regions (Figure 2.14).

than in 1990, leading to reductions in short-term peak ozone 
concentrations to daily peak values of around 60 micrograms 
per m3 of air. In contrast, mean ozone concentrations at many 
locations have been increasing due to a variety of different 
factors. For example, local emission reductions of nitrogen 
oxides, and hence nitric oxide, remove a key mechanism of ozone 
destruction and can result in increases in concentrations in urban 
areas (Royal Society 2008). There is also evidence of background 
ozone concentrations increasing by up to 10 micrograms per m3 
of air per decade since the 1970s (Royal Society 2008) due to 
changes in stratospheric ozone incursions, hemispheric transport 
and ozone formation responding to climate change. This will 
increase both mean and peak ozone levels. 

Global photochemical modelling studies performed for the HTAP 
(2010) assessment provide estimates of changes in surface 
ozone concentration for those regions that currently show the 
highest concentrations. These data indicate recent reductions in 
surface ozone in North America and Europe, which are likely to be 
due to effective controls of nitrogen oxides and volatile organic 
compounds over the past two decades in response to the US 
Clean Air Act and CLRTAP and EU targets in Europe. In contrast, 
trends in Asia are continuing upwards due to continued rapid 
industrialization across the region (Figure 2.15). However, these 
regional trends may hide large local variations. 

Future changes in tropospheric ozone concentrations have been 
explored using a number of different global photochemical 
models for a variety of emission scenarios and provide variable 
results (Figure 2.16). The HTAP (2010) assessment used a mean 
from six global models to assess the implications of emission 
changes between 2000 and 2050 following the RCP emission

Elevated ozone concentrations tend to be associated with 
regions experiencing high levels of uncontrolled emissions from 
industrial and urban centres as well as seasonal periods with 
high solar radiation. This causes high variability in global and 
seasonal concentrations. Regions in North America, Europe and 
Asia have been identified as having a high anthropogenic ozone 
load (Figure 2.15).

The targets defined for tropospheric ozone in the United Nations 
Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) region are now being 
exceeded at many locations. Coordinated action in Europe, 
however, has resulted in emissions of nitrogen oxide and volatile 
organic compounds currently being 30 and 35 per cent lower

scenarios. The outlook for ozone concentrations is heavily 
dependent on global and regional emission pathways. 

Assessment of the effectiveness of policies introduced to control 
ozone requires an extended global monitoring network covering 
rural as well as urban locations. Improved understanding of 
ozone’s impact on human health and ecosystems and how 
climate change will affect its formation, as well as how ozone 
acts in combination with other stressors such as global warming 
and excessive nitrogen deposition, will also be important. The 
growing interest in ozone as a short-lived climate forcer and the 
associated human health, arable-agriculture and ecosystem 
benefits that its reduction might bring (UNEP/WMO 2011) make 
this a pollutant of particular interest for policy intervention. 

Progress on internationally agreed goals
There are two examples of substantial progress in solving issues 
and achieving targets: protection of the stratospheric ozone layer 
and the removal of lead from petrol. 

Stratospheric ozone layer
Global regimes to address stratospheric ozone depletion include 
the 1985 Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone 
Layer and its 1987 Montreal Protocol on Substances that  
Deplete the Ozone Layer. The latest scientific assessments 
confirm the success of the action taken under the Montreal 
Protocol to eliminate consumption of ozone-depleting 
substances (Figure 2.17) (WMO 2011; UNEP 2010).

immune system. Excessive UV-B exposure can also damage 
terrestrial plant life, single-cell organisms and aquatic 
ecosystems. In the mid-1970s, it was discovered that the 
thinning of the stratospheric ozone layer was linked to the  
steady increase of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) – used for 
refrigeration and air conditioning, foam blowing and  
industrial cleaning – in the atmosphere. 

The most severe and surprising ozone loss – which came to 
be known as the ozone hole – was discovered to be recurring 
in springtime over the Antarctic. Thinning of the ozone layer 
has also been observed over other regions, such as the Arctic 
(Manney et al. 2011) and northern and southern mid-latitudes.

Stratospheric ozone protects humans and other organisms 
because it absorbs ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation from the sun.  
In humans, heightened exposure to UV-B radiation increases  
the risk of skin cancer, cataracts and suppression of the  

Despite the drastic reduction in consumption of ozone-depleting 
substances (Figure 2.17), their concentrations in the stratosphere 
remain high (as shown by the Ozone Depleting Gas Index (ODGI), 
Figure 2.18) as they have long atmospheric lifetimes. Figure 2.18

shows a 31 per cent recovery from a peak in 1994 at mid-latitudes 
and a 17 per cent recovery in the Antarctic. 

The hole in the Antarctic ozone layer is the clearest manifestation 
of the effect of ozone-depleting substances: springtime Antarctic 
total column ozone losses continue to occur each year, with the 
extent affected by meteorological conditions. Figure 2.19 shows 

the development of Antarctic ozone depletion over the last three 
decades, measured from 19 July to 1 December each year. The 
largest ozone hole on record occurred in 2006 (WMO 2011).

Model simulations for an ozone depletion scenario without the 
Montreal Protocol, the “World Avoided” scenario, show that there 
would have been a 300 per cent increase in the UV radiation at

Despite the successful implementation of certain Montreal 
Protocol provisions, some issues remain regarding the capture 
of ozone-depleting substances in old equipment and the 
destruction of collected or stockpiled appliances. 

Removal of lead from petrol
The goals in the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation to reduce 
exposure to lead have largely been met, with most countries 
having phased out lead in petrol since 2002, although there is 
evidence that leaded petrol is still sold in at least six countries 
(Figure 2.21). 

Lead poisoning, at all levels of exposure, causes adverse and 
often irreversible health effects in humans, particularly children, 
and accounts for about 9 million DALYs or around 0.6 per cent 
of the global burden of disease (WHO 2009). Acute exposure to 
high levels of lead affects the brain and central nervous system, 
causing coma, convulsions and even death. Lead can also 
adversely affect the immune, reproductive and cardiovascular 
systems, even at relatively low levels (WHO 2010). There is no 
threshold of exposure under which adverse effects cannot be 
detected (Lanphear et al. 2005; Schneider et al. 2003; Lovei 
1998; Schwartz 1994). 

While exposure to lead and lead poisoning may be due to many 
different sources and products – including paints and pigments, 
electronic waste, cosmetics and toys, traditional medicines, 
contaminated food and drinking water systems – lead in petrol 
has been the biggest contributor to global environmental lead 
contamination (WHO 2010).

A health-based regulation to remove lead from petrol in the 
United States was made in 1973 after the US Environmental 
Protection Agency concluded that lead emissions caused serious 
damage to the nervous system and serious impacts on the health 
of children in particular (Bridbord and Hanson 2009). Similar 
conclusions in Japan led to it becoming the first country to market 
unleaded petrol and, by 1981, less than 3 per cent of petrol sold 
there was leaded (Wilson and Horrocks 2008). 

From the period 1976–1980 to the period 1999–2002, the 
United States saw a 98 per cent reduction in the proportion of 
children aged one to five with levels of more than 10 micrograms 
of lead per decilitre of blood (CDC 2005). Other studies 
worldwide showed a strong correlation between decreased use 
of lead in petrol and reductions of lead in blood (Figures 2.22 
and 2.23) (Thomas et al. 1999). 

Interventions to prevent lead poisoning have demonstrated very 
large economic benefits. An analysis of the direct medical and 
indirect societal costs associated with lead poisoning in children 
in the United States found these to be US$43 billion annually, 
even at the relatively low levels of exposure to lead at the time 
(Landrigan et al. 2002). Another economic assessment, in this 
case for the full lifetime productivity of people, estimated that the 
increases in child intelligence, and thus their in-lifetime economic 
productivity, resulting from the removal of lead from petrol

mid-northern latitudes or a 550 per cent increase in UV radiation 
at the mid-latitudes by 2065 compared to 1980 levels (Figure 
2.20) (Newman and McKenzie 2011). Such a drastic increase 
in UV-radiation would have had serious consequences for both 
human health and the environment. In the United States alone, it 
is estimated that 22 million cases of cataract will be avoided for 
people born between 1985 and 2100 and 6.3 million skin cancer 
deaths will be avoided up to the year 2165 as a result of the 
Montreal Protocol (USEPA 2010). 

The most recent amendment of the Montreal Protocol, in 2007, 
accelerated the phase-out of hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), 
contributing to a reduction in global warming potential (GWP) of 
about 18 billion tonnes of CO2-equivalent emissions. 

The current phase-out of ozone-depleting substances is expected 
to lead to recovery of the ozone layer at different times in different 
regions (WMO 2011). For the world as a whole, annually averaged 
total column ozone is projected to return to 1980 levels between 
2025 and 2040, but this will take until mid-century in the Antarctic, 
with small episodic Antarctic ozone holes likely to persist even 
at the end of the 21st century (WMO 2011). Annually averaged 
total column ozone is projected to return to 1980 values between 
2015 and 2030 over northern mid-latitudes, while for southern 
mid-latitudes it is projected to recover between 2030 and 2040.

produced a benefit of between US$110 billion and US$319 billion 
in each birth cohort in the United States (Grosse et al. 2002).

According to Gould (2009), for every US$1 spent to reduce 
lead hazards, there would be a benefit of US$17–220, a better 
cost-benefit ratio than that for vaccines, which have long been 
described as the single most cost-beneficial medical or public 
health intervention. Another methodology that uses GDP 
extrapolation applied to published literature showed the global 

benefits of the phase-out of lead in petrol to be US$1–6 trillion 
per year, with a best estimate of US$2.45 trillion per year, roughly 
4 per cent of global GDP (Tsai and Hatfield 2011).

Recent evidence on health impacts has led the US Environmental 
Protection Agency to tighten its rolling three-month average air 
quality standard for lead from 1.5 micrograms of lead per m3 of 
air in 1978 to 0.15 micrograms per m3 in 2008 (USEPA 2008). The 
WHO annual ambient air guideline for lead remains at

0.5 micrograms of lead per m3 of air (WHO 2000). The removal of 
lead from petrol and the consequent reductions in health risks 
is an outstanding global success story, with the complete global 
elimination of lead in petrol expected within a few years.

EMERGING ISSUES
The most important new issue in the study of the atmospheric 
environment is the role of short-lived climate forcers, especially 
methane, tropospheric ozone and black carbon (UNEP/WMO 

2011). A subset of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) are also important 
short-lived climate forcers (UNEP 2011c). 

Black carbon particles in the atmosphere have a significant impact 
not only on human health but also on climate. They darken snow 
and ice surfaces, lower their albedo and increase their absorption 
of sunlight, which, along with atmospheric heating, exacerbates 
the melting of snow and ice around the world, including in the 
Arctic, the Himalayas and other glaciated and snow-covered

regions. This affects the water cycle and may increase risks of 
flooding. Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas and an important 
precursor for ozone generation. Methane, black carbon and 
tropospheric ozone are fundamentally different from the longer-
lived greenhouse gases as they remain in the atmosphere for 
a relatively short time. Reducing black carbon and methane 
emissions now will slow the rate of climate change within the first 
half of this century (Shindell et al. 2012; UNEP/WMO 2011). 

A second major emerging issue is the health effect of fine 
particles of natural origin. Every year, very large amounts of  
soil-derived dust and particles from wildfires engulf major 
populated areas. These can include soil particles from arid 
regions being deposited on coastal cities of China, Saharan dust 
reaching cities in Africa and the Mediterranean, and dust from 
drought-affected inland areas being deposited on cities in the 
United States and Australia. In addition, smoke from wildfires 
commonly raises particulate concentrations in Africa, Siberia, the 
Mediterranean, the United States, South East Asia and Australia. 
These particles can have major impacts on human health and 
a recent study suggests that almost 300 000 excess deaths per 
year can be attributed to fine particles of natural origin (Liu et al. 
2009a, 2009b). The sources can, however, be at least partially 
controlled (Chapter 3). Major interventions to re-vegetate 
degraded landscapes are continuing in several countries and the 
2003 ASEAN Agreement on Transboundary Haze Pollution is an 
example of an international agreement aimed at addressing the 
international transport of particles generated from forest burning.

As understanding of the relationship between particle size, the 
number of particles and health impacts has improved, concern has 
grown about the impacts of fine particles (smaller than  
2.5 micrometres in diameter) and ultrafine particles (1 micrometre 
and sub-micrometre sizes) on respiratory and cardiovascular 
health (Schmid et al. 2009; Valavanidis et al. 2008). As the volume 
of evidence is rapidly growing, it is likely that in the next few 
years air quality standards and guidelines to protect health by 
controlling exposure to ultrafine particles will be developed and 
become a focus of air quality policy, monitoring and management.

A number of new approaches to address the challenges of 
climate change have been proposed, including carbon capture 
and storage and geo-engineering (IPCC 2005; Rasch et al. 2008).  

ATMOSPHERIC GOVERNANCE AND AN INTEGRATED 
APPROACH TO MANAGEMENT 
In this section a simple analytical framework based on the level 
of concern for the different issues, the relative cost of addressing 
the problems, and the complexity of managing atmospheric 
issues is used to evaluate the governance of atmospheric 
problems. It suggests there is no one-size-fits-all solution to 
most atmospheric problems (Levy et al. 1993). The use of targets 
and timetables that worked for stratospheric ozone depletion 
may stall negotiations over climate change (Sunstein 2007). 
Emissions trading schemes that worked well for the reduction 
of sulphur dioxide in some developed countries may need to 
be complemented by other measures in developing countries 
(Chang and Wang 2010). Many emission sources release both 
greenhouse gases and air pollutants; some air pollutants have 
an additional effect on the climate; and reducing consumption of 
ozone depleting substances also reduces their impact on climate. 
There will be a growing need for decision-making frameworks and 
enabling environments that explicitly recognize the integrated 
nature of the atmosphere. 

The elimination of lead from petrol was made easier by a 
cost-effective alternative that proved easy to communicate to 
politicians and other stakeholders. With the well-timed support 
of international initiatives such as the UNEP Partnership for  
Clean Fuels and Vehicles, one country after another introduced 
lead-free fuels (Hilton 2006). 

Though there was no global binding agreement on the phase-
out of lead in petrol, there are parallels with the phase-out of 
ozone-depleting substances as a relatively manageable problem 
with cost-effective solutions and a high level of concern. For the 
elimination of substances that harm the ozone layer, governments 
agreed to the Vienna Convention, setting in motion an 
international negotiation process that culminated in the Montreal 
Protocol. The protocol became the model for other international 
agreements that called for a series of targets and timetables to 
eliminate ozone-depleting substances in the developed world, 
and for the creation of a multilateral fund to finance replacement 
technologies for developing countries beginning to manufacture 
CFCs (Benedick 1998). The process of arriving at this agreement 
helped raise concern, lower costs and clarify complexities.

Progress with other pollutants has been more uneven. For example, 
in the case of sulphur dioxide, existing technology, affordable 
abatement costs and growing understanding have made the issue 
increasingly manageable in much of the developed world. However, 
while target setting and the installation of flue-gas desulphurization 
have become common, growth in the number of coal-fired power 
plants has overwhelmed efforts to reduce emissions. Consequently, 
levels of acid deposition in East Asia remain high. 

The health impacts of particulate matter make its control the 
highest priority. However, measures can be costly and complex 
due to a multiplicity of industrial, transport, energy, commercial, 
domestic and natural sources, especially in developing countries. 
Various measures, such as technological improvements 

Atmosphere 57

of emissions (Chapter 16) such as in the way electricity is 
generated, the efficiency with which energy and resources are 
used, and the management of terrestrial ecosystems (Chapters 3 
and Chapter 12). Consumption levels and production processes 
may require the introduction of approaches such as a circular 
economy in which material flows are either made up of biological 
nutrients designed to re-enter the biosphere, or materials 
designed to circulate without entering the biosphere (Braungart 
et al. 2007). Such changes take time and, in the short term, 
existing cost-effective options need to be rolled out as far and as 
rapidly as possible to deliver early emission reductions that put 
the world on a path towards achieving established climate goals. 

Mitigating near-term climate change – the warming likely to be 
experienced over the next two to four decades – is important to 
prevent damage to vulnerable ecosystems such as the Arctic, and 
to vulnerable societies such as those in drought- or flood-prone 
regions. Addressing CO2 is not likely to be sufficient to mitigate 
warming in these timescales, partly because it is long-lived. 
Fortunately, near-term warming can be addressed by additional 
complementary policy action that reduces concentrations of 
short-lived climate forcers, including black carbon, methane and 
tropospheric ozone (Box 2.8) (Shindell et al. 2012; UNEP/WMO 
2011). Addressing these short-lived substances is an example of an 
integrated approach to atmospheric governance that provides an 
opportunity for policy development to meet multiple goals in a cost-
effective way. The improved awareness of atmospheric brown clouds 
emphasizes the integration of different atmospheric issues (Box 2.9). 
There is increasing evidence that the Antarctic ozone hole has affected 
the surface climate in the southern hemisphere (Polvani et al. 2011), 
and further links also exist between climate change and ozone-
depleting substances as many are also very strong greenhouse gases. 
Indeed, avoiding emissions of CFCs has brought about a significant 
contribution to climate change mitigation (Velders et al. 2007).

These interactions and links between different atmospheric 
issues provide opportunities to improve progress in reaching 
internationally set goals, maximizing benefits and avoiding 
policy conflicts. To make rapid progress, scientific knowledge 
needs to be properly presented to policy makers to allow them to 
deal more effectively with the complexity of the issues. The way 
in which options are analysed, costs and benefits weighed up, 
and evidence-based policies developed, requires considerable 
improvement. This will require closer interaction between 
the science and policy communities, increased stakeholder 
participation, capacity enhancement and technology transfer.

in vehicles, increased engine efficiency, cleaner fuels and 
particulate filters, have been successfully applied in different 
cities. Across the developed world urban levels of particulate 
matter began to fall sharply in the 1950s and 1960s. Cleaner 
technologies have enjoyed some success in reducing emissions 
in developing countries, but have not been sustained in rapidly 
growing cities where high demands for motorization, energy 
and industrial products have increased aggregate emissions. 
Both the complexity of the issue and the costs have hampered 
progress. To reduce exposure to indoor particulate matter 
national policies, including on rural development and energy, 
need to be mainstreamed into overall development policy. 

Governance issues related to climate change have a high level 
of complexity, mixed levels of concern and long lead times 
between actions and benefits, often beyond political timescales. 
The governance approach for climate change has in many ways 
followed a similar approach to that of the ozone layer, but with 
different results due to differences in the nature of the issues. 
A growing degree of concern led to a global agreement, the 
UNFCCC, which allowed negotiation of the Kyoto Protocol. This 
was intended to initiate the process of reducing anthropogenic 
greenhouse gas emissions, but even if fully implemented was 
never designed to be enough to stay within the UNFCCC agreed 
limit of a 2oC temperature increase. 

The approach of developing binding national targets within a 
global framework has so far not delivered emission reductions 
that would help achieve climate targets and internationally 
agreed goals. In the medium term, a promising approach appears 
to be the development of nationally appropriate mitigation 
actions – or NAMAs – to encourage countries to contribute to 
actions in a national context.

CONCLUSIONS, GAPS AND OUTLOOK
Concern for the impacts of atmospheric issues at global, regional 
and national scales has led to considerable efforts to control 
emissions to meet internationally agreed goals and targets. Some 
issues have been effectively dealt with. For others there has only 
been partial success, with improvements in some regions but 
problems remaining in others. 

The achievement of global climate goals will most likely 
require a transformational change addressing the main drivers 

Targets to protect the global atmosphere from air pollution are 
being met for stratospheric ozone depletion and lead in petrol.

Part 1: State and Trends

Box 2.8 Complementary actions to limit near-term climate change and improve air quality 

Implementing a limited number of measures targeting black 
carbon, tropospheric ozone and methane has the potential to 
reduce the rise in global temperature projected for 2050 by 
0.5oC – roughly half of the warming in the reference scenario 
(Figure 2.24) – substantially reducing the rate at which the 
world warms over the next few decades (Shindell et al. 2012; 
UNEP/WMO 2011). About half of this reduction could be 
attributed to reductions in methane emissions and about half 
to measures addressing incomplete combustion and targeting 
black carbon emissions. The projected reduced warming in 
the Arctic, about 0.7oC lower than the reference scenario in 
2050 according to this research, would be likely to be greater 
than that seen globally (UNEP/WMO 2011). There are further 
benefits for regional climate as several detailed studies  
of the Asian monsoon suggest that regional forcing by  
absorbing particles substantially alters precipitation patterns  

(UNEP/WMO 2011). As the reductions in atmospheric forcing 
are largest over the Indian sub-continent and other parts of 
Asia, the emission reductions might have a substantial effect on 
the Asian monsoon, mitigating disruption of rainfall patterns.

Full implementation of the identified measures would also 
substantially improve air quality, reducing premature deaths 
globally due to significant reductions in indoor and outdoor 
air pollution, and improving crop yields. The reductions in 
PM2.5 and tropospheric ozone concentrations resulting from 
the implementation of the measures could, by 2030, avoid 
2.4 million premature deaths (within a range of 0.7–4.6 
million deaths) and the loss of 52 million tonnes of the global 
production of maize, rice, soybean and wheat each year 
(within a range of 30–140 million tonnes), or 1–4 per cent 
(UNEP/WMO 2011).

For the majority of the world, however, most air quality guidelines 
are not being met as there is insufficient implementation of 
policies. Meanwhile, important ecosystems are experiencing 
pollution loads in excess of critical thresholds. In the near 
term, atmospheric issues such as particulate matter and other 
pollutants could, with adequate commitment and resources, be 
effectively addressed by the wider implementation of existing 
policies and technologies. 

The current development trajectory, based on existing models 
of international governance, is unlikely to meet internationally 
agreed atmospheric goals, especially those for mitigating  
climate change and reducing the health impacts of  
pollutants. Carefully selected approaches at national and 
regional scales need to be encouraged and facilitated by  
global coordination to increase the chance of reaching the  
targets in the near term. 

Atmosphere 59

Box 2.9 Atmospheric brown clouds 

Atmospheric brown clouds, which have been observed 
as widespread layers of brownish haze, particularly in 
South Asia (Figure 2.25), are regional-scale plumes of air 
pollutants consisting mainly of aerosol particles such as 
black carbon and precursor gases that produce aerosols and 
ozone. These clouds significantly affect the regional climate, 
the hydrological cycle and glacial melting. The pollutants 
can be transported by long-range and regional transport 

phenomena that push this haze towards the Himalayan 
ridge, where plain-to-mountain wind systems favour air-
mass transport to high altitudes (Bonasoni et al. 2010). 
The widespread nature of atmospheric brown clouds and 
findings related to their diverse and adverse effects have 
increased the need for the development of science, capacity 
and emission-reduction measures within an integrated 
framework.

Climate change presents the global community with one of the 
most serious challenges to achieving development goals. Serious 
impacts from climate change are unlikely to be avoided on the 
basis of current emission reduction pledges. In the medium term, 
progress could be made by encouraging further national pledges, 
taking into account individual country circumstances, and by the 
wide application of current technological and policy approaches. 

Measures to reduce emissions of short-lived climate forcers could 
contribute to reducing the temperature increase in the near term 
but, ultimately, a transformation in the way energy is provided 
and the efficiency with which electricity and other resources 

are used, coupled with a shift in consumption and production 
patterns and investment in innovation, will be required to 
achieve long-term climate goals. Such transformative change 
will also affect other atmospheric problems. But action should 
start now with the measures that are currently available while 
transformation takes place. Such action would bring significant 
benefits, particularly if the atmospheric issues and required 
policies were considered in an integrated way. 

Table 2.5 provides a summary of progress and a prognosis for  
the development of key atmospheric issues in their relation to 
goals and targets.

Main Messages 

Pressure on land resources has increased during 
recent years despite international goals to improve 
their management. The fourth Global Environment 
Outlook (UNEP 2007) highlighted the unprecedented 
land-use changes created by a burgeoning 
population, economic development and global 
markets. The outcome of those drivers continues 
to cause resource depletion and ecosystem 
degradation. 

Economic growth has come at the expense of 
natural resources and ecosystems. Many terrestrial 
ecosystems are being seriously degraded because 
land-use decisions often fail to recognize non-
economic ecosystem functions and biophysical 
limits to productivity. For example, deforestation 
and forest degradation alone are likely to cost the 
global economy more than the losses of the 2008 
financial crises. The current economic system, built 
on the idea of perpetual growth, sits uneasily within 
an ecological system that is bound by biophysical 
limits. However, some market-based approaches that 
attach value to ecosystem services offer incentives to 
reduce environmental damage.

Competing demands for food, feed, fuel, fibre 
and raw materials are intensifying pressures on 
land. Demands for food and livestock feed are 
increasing rapidly due to human population growth 
and changing diets. Demand for biofuels and raw 
materials have also risen sharply, driven by the 
increased population, greater consumption and 
biofuel-friendly policies. This simultaneous growth 
is causing land conversion, land degradation and 
pressure on protected areas. Climate change is 
placing additional stress on productive areas. One 
result is heightened tension between goals related to 
production and those related to conservation. 

Globalization and urbanization are aggravating 
competing demands on land. These processes 

expand and intensify the pressure on land systems 
by increasing the distances between places where 
products originate and where they are consumed. 
The greater distances can obscure the drivers of 
resource depletion and ecosystem degradation, 
produce higher environmental costs due to 
transport and infrastructure, and complicate the 
negotiation of sustainable land management 
practices. Large-scale international land deals are 
both an emerging outcome of and a contributor to 
this trend. Internationally coordinated responses 
are needed to address related social and 
environmental pressures.

Improved governance and capacity building are 
crucial to achieving sustainable land management. 
Many interventions meant to protect ecosystems 
have failed because they were created without 
recognizing local values or engaging local 
communities in their design and implementation. 
Capacity building across spatial and temporal 
scales is needed to improve land management. 
Current governance approaches include market-
based strategies such as the collaborative 
UN programme for Reducing Emissions from 
Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD), 
centralized institutional strategies such as 
certification, and decentralized strategies such as 
community-based resource management. All offer 
both opportunities and challenges for improving 
land governance. 

Potential exists to create more sustainable land 
systems. To solve these complex problems, it 
is critical to understand how diverse social and 
ecological drivers affect land systems at local, 
regional, national and global scales. A concerted 
effort by international organizations, the scientific 
community, and national and local institutions to 
coordinate their actions can create the policy options 
needed to achieve this goal.

INTRODUCTION
Changing climate patterns, economic globalization, population 
growth, increasing use of natural resources and rapid 
urbanization are putting pressure on terrestrial ecosystems 
as never before, and virtually all of them are under stress. 
Biophysical limits on what is available for human use are real 
and there are strong signals that these limits are close to being 
reached or have already been exceeded (Rockström et al. 2009). 
Even so, the fact that some areas show recent gains in forested 
area or land reclamation (Lambin and Meyfroidt 2010; Nepstad 
et al. 2009; Bai et al. 2008) suggests that declines are not 
inevitable, and indeed that recovery may be possible – even 
though original ecosystem functions may be modified or pressure 
on ecosystems may shift elsewhere (Meyfroidt et al. 2010). 

Growing demands for food, feed, fuel, fibre and raw materials 
create local and distant pressures for land-use change (Lambin 
and Meyfroidt 2011). The cascade of outcomes resulting from 
these demands is complicated by urbanization and globalization, 
which separate the production of goods from their consumption 
over vast distances (Barles 2010; Kissinger and Rees 2010). The 
central question is how these demands can be met – or managed 
– in ways that recognize the joint imperatives of human well-
being and environmental sustainability. Addressing this requires 
careful examination of the social relations and biophysical 

processes involved in managing terrestrial ecosystems, setting 
priorities for policies and policy instruments, and considering the 
likely distribution of implications, both positive and negative. 

The fourth Global Environment Outlook (GEO-4) (UNEP 2007) 
noted that increased demand for water, waste disposal and 
food had led to unsustainable patterns of land use and land 
degradation. It identified forest cover and composition, cropland 
expansion, intensification of agriculture, desertification and 
urban development as key topics in land-use change. GEO-4
concluded that continued inaction on land stewardship, 
combined with increased climate change, would reduce social 
resilience, making recovery from future stresses difficult or 
impossible. This chapter provides an update on the state and 
trends of global land systems including wetlands, explores 
major and emerging issues influencing changes in land use, 
examines the implications of recent changes for achieving 
international accords, and suggests some broad responses.

INTERNATIONAL GOALS 
The international goals selected to guide this chapter cover 
vital targets related to food security, poverty reduction 
and environmental sustainability (Table 3.1). This chapter 
identifies biophysical, social, economic and political 
factors that may enable or constrain their attainment.

The stakes are high: as Chapter 16 demonstrates, failure 
to achieve these targets could have severe impacts on 
human well-being and environmental integrity.

STATE AND TRENDS 
This section uses selected indicators to gauge the 
current state of agricultural land, forests, drylands, 
wetlands, polar areas and human settlements, and 
recent changes to these land covers and uses. 

Agriculture
Demands for food and livestock feed are rising rapidly due 
to population growth, urbanization and changing diets that 
include more animal products. One of the consequences of 
these changes is the widespread expansion of agricultural 
land allocated to livestock, both directly and indirectly through 
cropland dedicated to animal feed production (Rudel et al. 
2009; Naylor et al. 2005). At a time when water shortage and 
land degradation remain threats to food security, accelerated 
interest in biofuel, feeds and fibre in recent years imposes 
competing demands on how agricultural land is used. 

Agricultural land and production trends 
In 2009, there were approximately 3.3 billion hectares of pasture 
and 1.5 billion hectares of cropland globally, with the extent 
and proportion of total land area varying greatly across regions 
(Figure 3.1) (FAO 2012). In 2009, all regions except Europe 
had a greater proportion of land area devoted to pasture than 
to cropland. Although there has been only a slight increase in 
total cropland extent over the past decade, there has been a

Maize is an important crop in all regions other than West Asia, 
with the area harvested increasing by more than 25 per cent 
across Africa and Asia and the Pacific between 2001 and 2010. 
In total, approximately 160 million hectares of maize were 
harvested in 2010. Asia and the Pacific have the largest area of 
rice, but Europe and Africa experienced the greatest percentage 
increases between 2001 and 2010 – about 30 and 20 per cent 
respectively. The dominant soybean-producing regions are Latin

America and the Caribbean and North America, with the United 
States, Brazil and Argentina the three largest producers. Asia 
and the Pacific and Europe are the primary producers of wheat.

Increases in the area used for these crops have been 
accompanied by overall growth in yields (FAO 2012). Globally, 
the current yields of wheat, maize and rice have been estimated 
at 64, 50 and 64 per cent of their potential respectively, but 
the size of the yield gap varies greatly from region to region 
under the influence of different factors (Neumann et al. 2010). 
Larger gaps between actual and potential yields tend to occur 
where low-input agriculture is practised (Licker et al. 2010). 
Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean – two regions where 
crop area has expanded since 2001– still have relatively low 
yields compared to North America and Europe; if region-specific 
constraints can be assessed and overcome (Neumann et al. 
2010), there may be potential to increase food production 
in these regions while minimizing cropland expansion. 

Agricultural productivity is limited by biophysical and other 
factors. Extending conventional agriculture into uncultivated 
lands requires mechanization to modify the surface, and 
supplements in the form of fertilizers, herbicides, pesticides 
and irrigation water. Excessive use of machinery and chemical 
supplements, however, breaks up soil structure, increases 
erosion, chemically pollutes soil, contaminates groundwater 

and surface water, changes greenhouse gas fluxes, destroys 
habitat and builds genetic resistance to chemical supplements 
(Blanco-Canqui and Lal 2010; Foley et al. 2005; Buol 1995). 
With widespread adoption of intensive, mechanized, high-
input agricultural practices, the rate of soil erosion has greatly 
increased. Erosion in conventional agricultural systems 
is now over three times higher than in systems practising 
conservation agriculture, and over 75 times higher than in 
systems with natural vegetation (Montgomery 2007). Globally, 
soil erosion is contributing to the decline in agricultural land 
available per person (Boardman 2006) as degraded land is 
abandoned (Bakker et al. 2005; Lal 1996). Thus, the yield 
gains achieved by these methods come with ecological costs.

In continuously cultivated, low-input agricultural systems, rapid 
declines in soil fertility and yield, together with international 
commodity price changes, continue to impact human well-
being in agricultural communities (Koning and Smaling 2005). 
Sustainable intensification techniques offer the potential to 
improve soil fertility and yields in some situations while avoiding 
some of the problems of high-input agriculture just presented. 

While the future impact of climate change on global food 
production is difficult to specify, substantial evidence suggests 
that an increasing number of people will be directly affected by 
climate change impacts on agricultural areas (World Bank 2010).

Consumption trends
While the proportion of undernourished people has been 
declining – from 14 per cent of world population in 1995–1997 
to 13 per cent in 2010 – the absolute number rose over the 
same period from 788 million to an estimated 925 million 
due to population growth (Box 3.1) (FAO 2010b). Areas with 
chronic food insecurity face many obstacles, including regional 
conflicts, weak governance structures and a breakdown of 
local institutions, all of which affect access to and distribution 
of food (FAO 2010a). Many of the world’s undernourished 
people live in areas that are also particularly vulnerable to 
climate variability. Africa and Asia and the Pacific were the 
regions with the lowest average food consumption in 2007 
(Figure 3.3) (FAO 2012), but they were also the regions that 
had experienced the highest percentage increase. While 
the Asia and Pacific region is home to the largest number of 
undernourished people, at 578 million, sub-Saharan Africa 
has the highest proportion of undernourished people – 
about 30 per cent of its population in 2010 (FAO 2010b). 

Forests 
Forests play a crucial role in terrestrial ecosystems and 
provide a multitude of services such as shelter, habitats, 
fuel, food, fodder, fibre, timber, medicines, security and 
employment; regulating freshwater supplies; storing carbon 
and cycling nutrients; and helping to stabilize the global 
climate. Historically, forests have been under pressure due 
to increasing demands for shelter, agricultural land, meat 
production, and fuel and timber extraction, but in recent 

decades this pressure has increased due to competing 
demands for agricultural expansion and biofuel production, 
rapid urbanization and infrastructure development, and 
increased global demand for forest products. Forests are 
also under increasing stress from changes in mean annual 
temperatures, altered precipitation patterns, and more frequent 
and extreme weather events (Allen et al. 2010; Tiwari 2009).

Forest area 
Forests cover just over 4 billion hectares, 31 per cent of the 
world’s total land area (FAO 2011). The majority of these are 
boreal forests extending across northern and central Russia and 
much of Canada and Alaska. Large expanses of tropical forest are 
found in the Amazon, Africa’s Congo Basin and parts of South 
East Asia. Temperate forests remain in a patchy distribution 
across the United States, Europe and the Asian mid-latitudes. 

The rate of forest loss from both deforestation and natural 
causes is slowing, but remains alarmingly high (Box 3.2). At 
the global level, annual forest loss decreased from 16 million 
hectares in the 1990s to approximately 13 million hectares 
between 2000 and 2010 (FAO 2011). The highest rates of 
tropical forest loss over this period occurred in South America 
and Africa (Figure 3.4). Some rapidly developing countries 
that suffered extensive deforestation in the 1990s, including 
Brazil and Indonesia, have significantly reduced their rates 
of tropical forest loss (FAO 2011; Ometto et al. 2011), while 
less developed nations in Latin America and Africa continue to 
experience high rates of loss. Although much of the developed 
world has experienced net reforestation since the late 1800s 
as a result of rural-urban migration and farm abandonment 
(Walker 1993; Mather 1992), natural factors such as drought, 
forest fire and insect attacks have exacerbated forest loss in 
recent decades. However, the key drivers of forest loss are 
population growth, poverty, economic growth, land pricing, 
international demand for timber and other forest products, 
insecurity of the rights of local people, and incomplete valuation 
of forest ecosystems (Carr et al. 2005; Lambin et al. 2001).

Plantations
Forest plantations, generally cultivated for industrial purposes, 
increased by 50 million hectares globally between 2000 
and 2010, reaching 264 million hectares or 7 per cent of 
the total forest area (Table 3.2) (FAO 2011). Asia accounted 
for 28 million hectares, or 58 per cent of this increase. 
Generally, monoculture plantations tend not to enrich local 
biodiversity, but they do provide ecosystem services including 
timber, carbon and water storage and soil stabilization.

Productive and protective forest area
The global forest area designated for the production of timber 
and non-timber products declined from about 1.16 billion 
hectares in 2000 to about 1.13 billion hectares in 2010, an 
annual decrease of about 2.91 million hectares or 0.25 per cent 
(FAO 2011). However, the global forest area designated for 
protection of soil and water increased from about 272 million 
hectares in 2000 to about 299 million hectares in 2010, an 
annual increase of some 2.77 million hectares or 0.97 per cent 
(FAO 2011). Similarly, the global forest area designated for 
biodiversity conservation has increased from around 303 
million hectares to about 366 million hectares, an annual 
increase of about 6.33 million hectares or 1.92 per cent 
(FAO 2011). The main reason for the decrease in forest area 
designated for production is deforestation, and for the increase 
in protective forest area is afforestation (FAO 2010a).

Forest management and certification
The Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) and the Programme for 
the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC) are the two 
main forest management certification organizations. There 
was an increase in certified forests of about 20 per cent per 
year between 2002 and 2010 under these two agencies (UNEP 
2011c). However, in 2010 about 10 per cent of the total forest 
area was under FSC- or PEFC-certified forest management (UNEP 
2011c). These trends indicate that while there is improvement 
in forest management, much work remains to be done.

Forest carbon stock
Forests are considered an important sink for atmospheric 
carbon dioxide (CO2) because of their ability to store carbon 
in their biomass and soil (Anderson et al. 2011). More than 
75 per cent of the total terrestrial biomass carbon stock and 
more than 40 per cent of the soil organic carbon stock are 
found in forest ecosystems (Jandl et al. 2007). In the 1990s, 
forest carbon sequestration was equivalent to approximately 
one-third of carbon emissions from fossil fuel combustion 
and land-use change (Bonan 2008). Boreal forests store 
more carbon in their soils than tropical forests, while tropical 
forests store much more carbon in their plant biomass 
(Prentice et al. 2001). Pan et al. (2011) estimate that global 

forest systems constituted a total carbon sink of 2.4±0.4 
billion tonnes of carbon per year from 1990 to 2007.

Fires are a major source of greenhouse gas emissions from forests 
(van der Werf et al. 2010). Boreal forest ecosystems are prone to 
frequent and severe wildfires leading to large carbon emissions. 
Amiro et al. (2001) estimated that during the period 1949–1999, 
on average 2 million hectares of the Canadian boreal forest 
burnt annually (ranging from 0.3 to 7.5 million hectares in any 
given year), emitting a yearly average of 27±6 million tonnes 
of carbon (ranging from 3 to 115 million tonnes in any given 
year). Sukhinin et al. (2004) estimated that on average 7.7 million 
hectares of area burnt annually between 1995 and 2002 in eastern 
Russia and that 55 per cent, 4.2 million hectares, of that area was 
forest. Gillett et al. (2004) found that recent increases in area burnt 
in Canada are a result of anthropogenic climate change. In the 
future more fires, more area burnt and longer fire seasons may be 
expected in temperate and boreal regions (Flannigan et al. 2009).

Drylands, grasslands and savannahs
Drylands, grasslands and savannahs experience high spatial 
and temporal variability in rainfall, resulting in dramatic 
differences in plant growth, habitats and human livelihoods. 
Drylands cover approximately 40 per cent of the world’s land 
surface and are home to more than 2 billion people, 90 per cent 
of whom are in developing countries (UNEP 2007). However, 
the spatial extent of drylands remains uncertain due to 
variations in ecosystem sub-types, data variability and the 
different classes and thresholds applied to remotely sensed 
data, making global comparisons challenging (Reynolds et al. 
2007). Grasslands range from very dry, almost desert-like, to 
humid types. Savannahs are mixed tree-grass ecosystems, 
ranging from almost treeless grasslands to closed-canopy 
woodlands that occupy large areas in the tropics and sub-tropics, 
particularly in Africa, Latin America and Australia (Mistry 2000).

Trends in drylands, grasslands and savannahs
Fluctuations in precipitation are a major driver of change 
in plant cover, but grazing intensity has also been directly 
linked to long-term dryland degradation (Miehe et al. 2010). 
Transformation of rangelands to cultivated croplands is 

Land 73

leading to a significant, persistent decrease in overall 
dryland plant productivity. Sietz et al. (2011) indicated 
that the most important factors causing vulnerability in 
drylands are water stress, poverty, soil degradation, natural 
agronomic constraints and isolation from political centres.
 
Net primary productivity (NPP) is the net amount of carbon 
captured by vegetation through photosynthesis each year 
(Melillo et al. 1993). Approximately 2 per cent of global 
terrestrial NPP is lost yearly due to dryland degradation, 

equivalent to 4–10 per cent of dryland potential NPP (Zika 
and Erb 2009). Figure 3.5 shows how dryland degradation, 
measured in terms of NPP loss, is most widespread in the 
Sahelian and Chinese arid and semi-arid regions, followed by 
the Iranian and Middle Eastern drylands and to a lesser extent 
the Australian and Southern African regions. Sustainable 
development in drylands will rely on techniques that improve 
soil fertility, conserve soil and water and increase agricultural 
efficiency, such as mulch farming, conservation tillage 
and diverse cropping systems (Mortimore et al. 2009).

The ﬁgure evaluates progress towards the UNCCD targets, showing substantial progress in some areas and highlighting a need for improvement in 
others. Particularly encouraging is the high level of awareness about dryland degradation globally. Challenges have been encountered in aligning 
national action plans and developing integrated investment frameworks. The assessment process has also revealed problems in data availability and 
reporting methods (UNEP-WCMC (cid:29)(cid:28)(cid:26)(cid:26)), potentially enabling UNCCD to address these lessons learnt prior to the next reporting cycle in (cid:29)(cid:28)(cid:26)(cid:29).

As an international response to desertification, land degradation 
and drought in drylands, the United Nations Convention to 
Combat Desertification (UNCCD) was adopted in 1995 and 
has since been signed by 194 Parties – 193 countries plus 
the European Union. Following mixed results in its initial 
implementation phase (UNCCD 2007), Parties to the Convention 
adopted a ten-year strategic plan for 2008–2018 to revitalize 
it. The plan includes a results-based management approach 
built on a set of specific objectives and indicators, and a 
new monitoring, assessment and reporting process – the 
performance review and assessment of implementation system. 

Wetlands 
In 2003, the European Space Agency, in collaboration with 
the secretariat of the Convention on Wetlands of International 
Importance (Ramsar Convention), launched the GlobWetland 
project to demonstrate the current capabilities of Earth 

observation technology to support inventorying, monitoring 
and assessment of wetland ecosystems. The project revealed 
a major gap between the findings of the Earth observation and 
wetland communities (Jones et al. 2009), with considerable 
inconsistency in global wetlands estimations (Table 3.3).

The conversion of wetlands continues. For both inland and 
coastal wetlands, the most salient drivers of change are 
population growth and increasing economic development, 
which in turn promote infrastructure development and land 
conversion including agricultural expansion (Wood and van 
Halsema 2008). Other direct drivers affecting wetlands are 
deforestation, increased withdrawal of freshwater, diversion of 
freshwater flows, disruption and fragmentation of the landscape, 
nitrogen loading, overharvesting, siltation, changes in water 
temperatures and invasion by alien species (Fraser and Keddy 
2005). In 14 deltas analysed by Coleman et al. (2008), over

half of the studied wetland area of 1.6 million hectares had 
been irretrievably lost over a 14-year period due to natural 
causes, conversion to agriculture or industrial use. Global 
climate change may exacerbate the loss and degradation 
of coastal wetlands. For example, Syvitski et al. (2009) 
analysed the effects of human activities on delta subsidence, 
susceptibility to flooding and vulnerability to sea level rise, 
concluding that the area of deltas at risk of flooding could 
increase by more than 50 per cent by the end of this century. 

The deforestation, drainage and conversion to agriculture 
of peatland results in substantial emissions of CO2 and 
nitrous oxide (Mitra et al. 2005). Globally, peatlands cover 
3 per cent of the world’s land surface, about 400 million 
hectares, of which 50 million hectares are being drained 
and degraded, producing the equivalent of 6 per cent of all 
global CO2 emissions (Crooks et al. 2011). Avoiding further 
wetland degradation could result in significant climate 
change mitigation (Wetlands International 2011).

Because of increasing demand for land for food, feed,  
biofuels and materials, the loss of wetlands and associated 
ecosystem services is likely to continue (CA 2007). Globally, 
coastal wetlands such as mangroves are continuing to decline  
by more than 100 000 hectares, over 0.7 per cent, per year,  
but that rate of loss has slowed relative to the 1 per cent 
per year of the 1980s. Although, in most regions, rates 
of loss have decreased compared to the 1980s and 
1990s, mangrove losses in Asia accelerated again during 
2000–2005 (UNEP-WCMC 2010). Despite these losses, the 
Asia and Pacific region holds the largest spatial extent of 
mangrove systems – more than 50 per cent of the global 
total. Other major mangrove areas are in northern Latin 
America, Eastern and Western Africa, and the Red Sea. 

Polar regions 
The Arctic’s permafrost – the top 3.5 metres of soil that remains 
permanently frozen for 24 months or more – contains the 
largest deposits of organic carbon on Earth. But due to some 

of the most rapid warming on the planet (McGuire et al. 2009; 
Tarnocai et al. 2009), with temperatures in the permafrost having 
already risen by up to 2oC over the past two to three decades 
(AMAP 2011), this is likely to become a substantial source of 
carbon emissions over the next century (Schuur et al. 2008). 
The Arctic’s tundra and boreal forest ecosystems currently act 
as a carbon sink (McGuire et al. 2009), but it is possible that 
the Arctic region will become a net emitter over the course of 
the 21st century (Schuur et al. 2008; Zimov et al. 2006) as 
up to 90 per cent of near-surface permafrost is expected to 
disappear due to thawing by 2100 (Lawrence et al. 2008). 

Methane emissions, primarily from wetlands, also play an 
important role in the carbon balance of the Arctic (O’Connor 
et al. 2010). Although just 2 per cent of global methane 
emissions originate in the Arctic, this region has seen the 
largest proportional increase in emissions, rising by nearly 
a third between 2003 and 2007 (Bloom et al. 2010). Some 
of these emissions originate in the escape of methane from 
sequestration within hydrate crystals frozen beneath permafrost. 
These methyl hydrates also occur in abundance beneath the 
deep ocean floor and within continental shelves (O’Connor et al. 
2010). Methane is 25 times more effective at trapping heat in 
the atmosphere than CO2 over a 100-year horizon (IPCC 2007).

Other climate-related land changes occurring in the Arctic 
include the northward movement of tree lines, woody vegetation 
encroachment into the tundra, and a longer growing season 
– resulting in an increase in plant productivity (Figure 3.7) 
(Epstein et al. 2012; Walker et al. 2012; Callaghan et al. 
2011; Wang and Overland 2004; Zhou et al. 2001; Myneni 
et al. 1998). Whilst these processes remove CO2 from the 
atmosphere, it is likely that the release of carbon from thawing 
permafrost and other processes will outpace CO2 sequestration 
by vegetation (Schuur et al. 2008; Zimov et al. 2006).

Environmental changes such as the northward advance of tree 
lines, combined with rapid industrial development, create 
challenges for traditional livelihoods such as reindeer herding.

Nevertheless, if well planned, urban areas can reduce the 
overall pressure on land resources of a growing population.

Satellite-based studies calculate urban land cover at less than 
1 per cent of the planet’s total land surface (Schneider et al. 2009). 
However, the impact of urban areas on the global environment 
cannot be measured only by their physical expansion. Some studies 
estimate that 60–70 per cent of total anthropogenic greenhouse 
gas emissions are directly or indirectly related to urban areas, 
with a few wealthy cities contributing the majority of emissions 
(Dodman 2009). It is the concentration of population, economic 
activities and wealth generation in urban areas that drives their 
impact on the global environment, with demands for food, energy, 
water and production materials that have significant consequences 
for land-use change around the world (Grimm et al. 2008). 

Most of the understanding of urbanization as a land-change 
process is based on individual case studies (Seto et al. 2010) 
that reveal significant differences in urbanization processes 
between regions and countries, and even within countries. 
Ecological footprint analyses of cities provide a symbolic 
parameter illustrating the impacts of those differences on the 
local and global environment. For example, the inhabitants 
of a typical city of 650 000 inhabitants in the United States 
collectively require 3 million hectares of land to meet their 
domestic needs, while those of a similar-sized city in India 
require just 280 000 hectares (Newman 2006). 

Urban trends 
The UN Population Division projects that between 2007 and 
2050, the world’s urban population will increase by more than 
3 billion, with almost all future population growth expected 
to take place in the cities and towns of developing countries 
(Montgomery 2008). By 2050, more than 70 per cent of China’s 
population and 50 per cent of India’s is likely to be urban, with 
China expected to have 30 additional cities of more than 1 million 
inhabitants and India 26 (Seto et al. 2010). 

Urbanization is not a homogeneous process (Seto et al. 2010). 
Recent studies suggest a significant increase in land requirements 
for urban uses in the next 40 years – potentially an additional 
100–200 million hectares (Bettencourt et al. 2007) (Figure 3.8). 
This increase is expected to occur primarily in sprawled patterns 
and to have major effects on greenhouse gas emissions, air 
pollution and waste management (Lobo et al. 2009). 

Very large cities exert local and global impacts on the environment, 
for example the emission of greenhouse gases or aerosols that 
have a dimming effect in the atmosphere. Small and medium 
cities, despite their own environmental impacts, may have better 
opportunities to improve their relationship with the environment 
and social well-being, particularly in low-income and middle-
income countries, where population will concentrate in the future 
(Seto et al. 2010, Martine et al. 2008). Only 12 per cent of the total 
urban population in developing countries lives in very large urban 
areas of more than 10 million people, while 40 per cent lives in 
cities of less than 1 million (Figure 3.9) (Montgomery 2008).

Access to many areas on land, especially in northern Canada 
and Russia, is becoming more difficult as ice roads melt earlier 
and freeze later, severely affecting communities and industrial 
development (AMAP 2011; Stephenson et al. 2011). At the 
same time, because the seasonal Arctic Ocean ice cover is 
decreasing in area, volume and duration, new economic 
opportunities are presenting themselves, including increased 
tourism, forestry, agriculture, and expanding oil, gas and mining 
developments. Nonetheless, some communities in the Arctic 
most affected by thawing permafrost and/or coastal erosion 
are being forced to relocate (ACIA 2005), and further research 
is needed to foresee how living conditions are likely to change 
and to evaluate possible adaptation options, taking the region’s 
indigenous peoples into particular consideration (AMAP 2011).

At the southern pole, the landmass of Antarctica also has a 
profound effect on the Earth’s climate and ocean systems. 
However, in contrast to the Arctic, the Antarctic land mass is 
99 per cent covered by glacial ice. The changes occurring in this 
region are discussed in greater detail in Chapters 4 and 7.

Urban areas and human infrastructure
Urbanization has progressed at an extraordinary rate in recent 
decades and this growth is projected to continue throughout the 
century. Urban areas are the hubs of social processes, driving 
many changes through material demands that affect land use 
and cover, biodiversity and water resources, locally to globally.

The upper delta area shown in the left-hand image had over 7 million people in 1990, but has since more than tripled to over 25 million, with 
the cities of Dongguan, Foshan, Guangzhou and Shenzhen beginning to merge into one continuous city. This intense urbanization has led to 
the loss of productive farmland and natural areas, as well as creating a variety of environmental problems.

MAJOR ISSUES IN LAND CHANGE 
The changes in land use presented in this chapter are a 
product of complex interactions between human actions 
and biophysical processes. International goals provide one 
set of guidelines for land management, but these are often 
overshadowed by other pressures and competing demands. 
Here, four major themes are explored that help to explain the 
apparent movement away from achieving land-related goals: 
•	 economic	growth	at	the	expense	of	natural	capital;	
•	 competing	demands	for	land;	
•	 increased	separation	of	production	from	consumption;	and	
•	 governance	challenges	related	to	sustainable	land 

management. 

Each is illustrated with examples of impacts on land 
resulting from these pressures, as well as opportunities 
to move land management decisions towards social and 
ecological outcomes in line with international goals. 

Economic growth and natural capital
The global economic system is based on the pursuit of 
perpetual and unsustainable growth. Distorted incentives 
have reduced natural capital, while often rendering attempts 

78

Part 1: State and Trends

to curtail resource or energy use politically problematic 
(Chapter 1) (Daly and Farley 2010; Dasgupta 2009). Simply put, 
economic growth has come at the expense of natural capital. 

Today, many terrestrial ecosystems exhibit degradation and 
reduced resilience. This can be linked to the failure to account for 
the vital functions of these ecosystems in economic cost-benefit 
analyses. For example, financial pressures have encouraged 
the irrigation and subsequent salinization of vast dryland 
areas, making them very difficult to rehabilitate (Sakadevan 
and Nguyen 2010). Wetlands continue to be drained for 
agriculture and urban development, destroying their ability to 
regulate water quantity and quality and buffer against extreme 
weather events (Box 3.3). Deforestation and forest degradation 
produce financially attractive short-term returns, but global 
natural capital losses have been recently estimated at between 
US$2 trillion and US$ 4.5 trillion each year (Kumar 2010).

Ecosystems have priceless spiritual, aesthetic and cultural 
dimensions. They are also the cornerstones of economies, but 
their real value remains effectively invisible in national profit 
and loss accounts (TEEB 2010). Allowing the privatization of 
profits from the extraction of natural capital at the expense of 
more innovative and equitable land management approaches 
is a pervasive problem across all land covers and uses. 
Incentives that are narrowly focused on economic growth often 
encourage land management that degrades ecosystem services, 

Box 3.4 The Mau Forests complex, Kenya 

Box 3.3 Restoring wetlands along the Mississippi

Wetlands can help control floods by absorbing and storing 
high levels of precipitation. However, the Mississippi River 
basin in the United States has historically been managed 
by draining wetlands for agriculture and building dams and 
levees to contain floodwaters, a strategy that has worsened 
the impacts of flood events (Hey and Philippi 1995). The 
coastal wetlands of the Mississippi Delta have likewise been 
replaced with artificial flood control structures, compromising 
ecosystem services such as soil formation, provision of 
habitat for fish and crustaceans, and protection against 
severe storms (Twilley and Rivera-Monroy 2009).

In 2005, Hurricanes Katrina and Rita brought into focus 
the importance of maintaining wetlands as buffers against 
natural hazards. The State of Louisiana has since assigned 
37 per cent of revenues from new oil and gas projects to 
coastal protection and restoration; combined with other 
funds, this could provide up to US$1 billion per year over the 
next 30 years (Day et al. 2007). Research suggests that an 
investment of US$10–15 billion in restoring the Mississippi 
Delta could generate the equivalent of US$62 billion by avoiding 
losses from storm damage and reduced ecosystem functions 
while gaining additional ecological benefits (Batker et al. 2010).

The Mau Forests complex in Kenya provides goods and services worth US$1.5 billion a year through water for hydroelectricity, 
agriculture, tourism and urban and industrial use, as well as erosion control and carbon sequestration (TEEB 2010). Alternative 
accounting has helped spur the government of Kenya to invest in rehabilitating the area and its vital ecological services, though 
challenges remain in addressing the interests of people living there (UNEP 2011a).

while including and valuing ecosystem services in accounting 
systems can help protect and enhance them. Successful 
strategies rest on improving understanding of ecosystem 
functions and building that understanding into policies and 
institutions (Daily et al. 2009). Indeed, recognition of the 
multiple uses and multiple values of ecosystems can be used 
to leverage resources for their protection (Boxes 3.3 and 3.4). 

Over the past two decades, payment for ecosystem services 
(PES) has gained attention as a mechanism with the potential 
to account for services provided by ecosystems in market 
transactions, build bridges and balance interests between the 
users and providers of these services, and deal with the linked 
challenges of conservation and poverty alleviation (Pascual 
and Corbera 2011; Engel et al. 2008). Payment for ecosystem 
services involves a suite of approaches linked to a broad 
central idea: “the transfer of resources among social actors 
with the objective of creating incentives to align individual and/
or collective land-use decisions with the social interest in the 
management of natural resources” (Muradian et al. 2010). 

The concept of PES offers several advantages over conventional 
conservation approaches: it complements command-and-
control and polluter-pays principles with more flexible, 
incentive-based approaches; it is conditional and voluntary, 
with the potential to promote equity, accountability and cost 
effectiveness; and it can produce co-benefits for livelihoods 
and contribute to poverty alleviation (Borner et al. 2010; van 
Hecken and Bastiansen 2010). Positive land-use outcomes 
have been achieved through some PES initiatives in, for 
example, Colombia, Costa Rica and Nicaragua, where tree 
cover has increased and degraded pasture decreased due 
to a regionally integrated PES project (Chapter 12).

However, groups who oppose the idea of nature being 
commoditized or traded have criticized the concept (Pascual 
and Corbera 2011; Corbera et al. 2007). Furthermore, despite 
promising initial benefits such as increased land-tenure 
security, current evidence of PES’s cost effectiveness and 
the conditions under which it has positive environmental 
and socio-economic impacts remains inconclusive, 
particularly in developing countries with weak governance 
(Pattanayak et al. 2010; Wunder et al. 2008). 

Challenges ahead for PES focus on cost effectiveness, 
monitoring capacity, enforcement, transparency and 
accountability, and clear boundaries to land access and 
tenure rights (Borner et al. 2010). Taking into account 
social norms and culture, building trust between actors 
and dealing with power relations will ultimately define 
benefit allocation strategies and successful long-term 
implementation of PES (Bille 2010; van Hecken et al. 2010). 

Competing demands for land
The challenge of feeding a growing human population has 
been compounded by rising affluence in some regions. 
Changing diets and increasing demand for biofuels and 

80

Part 1: State and Trends

other industrial materials such as timber have intensified 
competition for land and pressures on terrestrial ecosystems. 

Food security
To meet the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) 1c on reducing 
hunger, global food production will have to increase and food  
distribution improve. To meet MDG 7 and other environmental 
goals, agriculture needs to reduce its current environmental 
impacts (Figure 3.10). 

Although estimates vary, the Food and Agriculture Organization 
of the United Nations (FAO) projects that to reduce the proportion 
of developing countries’ populations that are chronically 
undernourished to 4 per cent in the year 2050, world food 
production will need to increase by 70 per cent from 2005 levels 
(Bruinsma 2009). Although food consumption per person is 
increasing across all regions, it is unevenly distributed and the 
number of malnourished people continues to rise as more grain 
is diverted to produce meat for those who can afford it. Livestock 
and poultry can serve as an important source of protein in areas 
of chronic food insecurity and provide an important buffer in 
times of crop failure, but a disproportionate share of agricultural 
land is dedicated to meat and dairy production for consumption 
in developed countries. Such land use is less efficient in meeting 
global food needs and comes with greater environmental 
consequences than cropland (Steinfeld et al. 2006). For

example, it is estimated that the amount of grain fed to livestock 
in the United States is more than seven times that consumed 
directly by the population (Pimentel and Pimentel 2003).

Meanwhile, about one-third of all food that is produced for 
human consumption is wasted or lost – approximately 1 300 
million tonnes annually (Toulmin et al. 2011). The concept of food 
security moves beyond the question of whether adequate food 
is available and considers whether people have physical and 
economic access to food (FAO 2008). This draws attention to a 
broad set of social and political issues related to food distribution. 

It will be challenging to meet future global demand for food 
while avoiding, or at least mitigating, negative impacts on 
forests, wetlands and other ecosystems – and at the same 
time reducing poverty, supporting livelihoods, and ensuring 
food safety and animal welfare. There is little debate that 
more land will have to be allocated to agriculture, but this 
will not be sufficient without increasing yields and reducing 
losses along the food supply chain. Climate change is likely 
to complicate matters further by affecting crop yields in many 
areas (Figure 3.11) (Ringler et al. 2010; Lobell et al. 2008). 

A variety of agricultural approaches is likely to provide the 
best outcomes for food security and environmental well-being. 
High-input, intensive agricultural methods undeniably increase 
agricultural yields, though these gains may come at the expense 
of long-term soil fertility (Foley et al. 2005). Location-specific 
approaches are also needed in order to achieve sustainable

land use based on biophysical as well as socio-economic 
considerations (Chapter 12) (DeFries and Rosenzweig 2010), 
while agroecology and urban agriculture can contribute to the 
global food supply (Perfecto and Vandermeer 2010; Zezza and 
Tasciottia 2010). Agricultural practices that conserve soils and 
nutrients such as no-till farming (Chapter 12) can complement 
efforts to restore degraded and abandoned agricultural land. 

Meeting the global need for food will be one of the most 
important challenges of this century, and a portfolio 
of solutions including conservation agriculture, high-
yielding cultivars, and efficient and carefully managed use 
of fertilizers is needed rather than promotion of a single 
strategy. Advocates of genetically modified crops point out 
their potential to increase yields while reducing the use of 
agricultural chemicals (Brookes and Barfoot 2010; Fedoroff et 
al. 2010), although resistance to their use remains, in part, 
due to the uncertainty of potential risks to human health 
and further loss of agricultural biodiversity (Chapter 5).

Meat production
Meat production has increased significantly during the past 
two decades, outpacing the rate of population growth over 
the same period (Figure 3.12). Large differences in meat 
consumption exist both within and between countries, 
ranging from an average of 83 kg per person per year in North 
America and Europe to 11 kg per person per year in Africa 
(FAO 2009). Population growth, urbanization and increasing 
incomes are expected to continue to raise demand for meat, 
particularly in developing countries (Delgado 2010).

The environmental impacts of meat production depend on 
intensity, extent and management. Nonetheless, growing 
demand for meat worldwide has been an important driver of 
deforestation in South America, as forest is cleared to plant 
soy for livestock feed (Box 3.5). As meat production has grown, 
so has the area harvested for soybean crops, which expanded 
to 98.8 million hectares in 2009 from 74.3 million hectares in 
2000, and 50.4 million hectares 30 years ago (FAO 2012).
An increasing demand for meat has the potential to compound 
rangeland degradation. Livestock production accounts for 
over 8 per cent of global freshwater use and is among the 
largest sources of water pollution leading to eutrophication,

algal blooms, coral reef degradation, human health issues, 
antibiotic resistance and disruption of nutrient cycling 
(Steinfeld et al. 2006). Considering the entire commodity chain, 
including deforestation for grazing and forage production, 
meat production accounts for 18–25 per cent of the world’s 
greenhouse gas emissions, which is more than global transport 
(UNEP 2009b; Fiala 2008; Steinfeld et al. 2006). Reducing meat 
consumption in regions where it is relatively high could thus 
bring a range of environmental benefits (Marlow et al. 2009). 

Biofuels
An urgent search for renewable sources of energy has resulted 
in policies that promote the use of biofuels. Increased 
production of crops that can be used for multiple purposes 
including food, feed or fuel – such as oil palm, soy, maize 
and sugar cane – is indicative of this trend (Figure 3.14). 
However, subsidies that promote biofuels have been linked to 
distortions in the world food system, leading to increases in 
food prices (Pimentel et al. 2009). Recent changes in the linked 
production of food, feed and fuel have far-reaching impacts 
for ecology as well as for social relations and vulnerability 
(Bernstein and Woodhouse 2010; McMichael and Scoones 
2010). While no energy source is completely problem-free, 
biofuels present particular challenges to land use and terrestrial 
ecosystems. This, combined with the recent rapid increase 
in their production, is the reason for examining them here.

While a major motivation for promoting and investing in 
biofuels has been the desire to reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions, recent research shows that their emissions balance 
varies widely depending on which crops are grown, where, 
and which production methods are used (Cerri et al. 2011; 
Johnston et al. 2009; Pimentel et al. 2009). Biofuel crops 
have been linked to deforestation, for example in Indonesia 
(Box 3.6), and to encroachment into conservation lands. 
Once these land-use changes are taken into account, the 
biofuel carbon balance can become negative, meaning that 
more carbon is released producing and using biofuels than 
the equivalent amount of energy from fossil fuels (Melillo et 
al. 2009; Fargione et al. 2008; Searchinger et al. 2008). 

Crop-use changes stemming from demand for biofuels have 
already been observed. For example, in 2007, the United 
States converted 24 per cent of its corn to ethanol, supported 
by government subsidies. The US Renewable Fuels Standard 
of 2007 mandated an increase in biofuel production from 
around 6.5 billion litres (1.7 billion US gallons) per year in 
2001 to 136 billion litres (36 billion US gallons) per year by 
2022 (US Government 2007). Also in 2007, US farmers planted 
the largest area in maize since 1944: 37.8 million hectares, 
an area 20 per cent bigger than in 2006 (Gillon 2010). This 
crop change, which was subsidized, resulted in calling back 
into production many set-aside lands in the Conservation 
Reserve Program (CRP) that used to help check surpluses, 
maintain price levels and promote an ecological balance. 
Between late 2007 and March 2009, the total area of CRP land 
in the United States dropped from 14.9 million to 13.6 million 

Box 3.5 Brazil’s forest policy and soy moratorium 

While most Amazonian deforestation is linked to cattle 
pasture and ranching, forest conversion for cropland 
– especially soy – increased in Mato Grosso during 
2000–2004 (Morton et al. 2006), and evidence suggests 
that by displacing pastures, soy production may also drive 
deforestation (Barona et al. 2010). A sharp decline in annual 
deforestation during 2004–2009 (Figure 3.13) coincided with 
the introduction of new policies as part of the Action Plan 
for Prevention and Control of Deforestation in the Amazon 
(PPCDAm). These include:
•	 creating	new	protected	areas	in	deforestation	hot 

spots; 

areas in a GIS database to make illegal deforestation 
promptly apparent (BRASIL 2009). 

Pressure from consumers in Europe and a Greenpeace 
campaign against illegal deforestation also led the Brazilian 
Vegetable Oil Industry Association (ABIOVE) and National 
Cereal Exporters’ Association (ANEC) to sign an agreement in 
July 2006 in which members pledge not to acquire soybeans 
from newly deforested areas in the Amazon. The success of 
this moratorium has prompted efforts to persuade the beef 
industry to make its own commercial agreement.

•	 establishing	a	deforestation	monitoring	programme	using	

satellite imagery; 

•	 an	assertive	law	enforcement	strategy	allowing	for	property	

apprehension, forfeiture or even destruction; 

•	 withholding	public	rural	credit	from	producers	who	break	

environmental regulations; and 

•	 an	obligation	on	municipalities	to	reduce	deforestation	
rates below a certain threshold and register protected 

Despite the apparent success of these and other policies and 
agreements in reducing deforestation, challenges remain. For 
example, many are concerned that proposed changes to Brazil’s 
forest code may reduce forest protection (Tollefson 2011). The 
rise of deforestation in other biomes and countries is also a 
concern, which has led the Brazilian government to launch an 
action plan for the Cerrado biome (BRASIL 2010) and disseminate 
lessons learned to neighbouring Amazonian countries.

hectares (Gillon 2010). In other words, close to 1.3 million 
hectares of conservation lands were lost in just over a year. 

A similar trend can be seen in the European Union (EU), 
particularly Germany, whose production capacity for biodiesel 
increased fivefold between 2004 and 2008 (Franco et al. 

2010). Although Germany’s rapeseed cultivation reached 
1.53 million hectares in 2007, a little over half of which was 
used for fuel to meet its EU mandatory biodiesel blending 
target, Germany needs an additional 1.8 million hectares of 
rapeseed, which can be done only by increasing the conversion 
of permanent grassland – similar to the US CRP. However,

Germany has already used its maximum allowable 5 per cent 
of grassland under the EU Common Agricultural Policy (Franco 
et al. 2010). Such constraints on agricultural expansion in the 
United States and European Union help explain the push to 
outsource biofuel (and food) production to other countries.

Critiques of biofuels have been accompanied by the emergence 
of alternatives. For example, under certain conditions, 
community-based biofuel production for local consumption 

can be desirable, such as in Brazil where some small-scale 
farmers produce fuel for their own vehicles and equipment 
(Fernandes et al. 2010). To be considered beneficial, biofuel 
production should satisfy multiple criteria, including real 
energy gains, greenhouse gas reductions, preservation of 
biodiversity and maintenance of food security (Tilman et al. 
2009). Indeed, the principles of ecoagriculture (Milder et al. 
2008) can be applied to help guide biofuel production towards 
the mutual attainment of production, livelihood and conservation 

Box 3.6 Palm oil expansion and rainforest destruction in Indonesia

The expansion of oil palm plantations, both for food and fuel, 
is one of the most significant causes of rainforest destruction 
in South East Asia, where the area under oil palm increased 
from 4.2 million to 7.1 million hectares between 2000 
and 2009 (FAO 2012). In Indonesia, two-thirds of oil palm 
expansion has occurred by converting rainforest (UNEP 2009a). 
Clearing tropical forests produces a carbon debt that lasts from 
decades to centuries, contradicting one of the main reasons for 
pursuing biofuels in the first place (Gibbs et al. 2008). It also 
compromises vital ecosystem functions provided by rainforests 
that cannot be replaced by plantations. 

In 2009 the Indonesian government projected a dramatic 
increase in the area planted to oil palm during the next one or 

two decades – up to 20 million hectares – mostly on cleared 
forest land (UNEP 2009a). This target was based on two linked 
assumptions: 
•	 increasing	demand	in	China	and	India	for	cooking	oil	and	
other consumer goods, from chocolate to shampoo, that 
use palm oil; and 

•	 increasing	demand	for	biofuels	in	Europe	and	elsewhere	

(McCarthy 2010; White and Dasgupta 2010). 

In May 2011 the President of Indonesia signed a two-year 
moratorium on new permits to clear primary forests and 
peatlands, potentially slowing oil palm expansion; however, 
secondary forests and existing contracts remain exempt 
(USDA 2011).

objectives. While such systems represent only a tiny portion 
of overall biofuel production, they provide an opportunity for 
equitably distributed alternative fuels to benefit land-based 
ecosystems, for example by reducing charcoal production. 

Timber and wood products
Forests are the main source of timber for fuel, industry, pulp, 
paper and wood-based composites (Table 3.4). Key factors 
contributing to the rise in consumption are population and 
economic growth (FAO 2011). In addition, an increase in 
the absolute number of people living in poverty, especially 
in rural areas, and continued urbanization contribute to 
the growth in consumption of wood fuels, while enhanced 
economic growth in emerging economies contributes to the 
increase in consumption of paper and paper products. 

Protected areas
Protected areas are an important mechanism for the conservation 
of vulnerable environmental resources, although there are 
controversies as to whether they sometimes come at the expense 
of the livelihoods of local people. Rates of deforestation are 
much lower within reserves than outside them (Scharlemann 
et al. 2010; Nagendra 2008), and some research cites the 
positive benefits that protected areas have on the conservation 
of ecosystem services (Stolton and Dudley 2010). But when 
the underlying pressures imposed by local populations are not 
adequately considered, substantial monitoring and enforcement 
are needed to enforce rules designed to sustain natural resources, 
and governance has been found to be most effective when local 
users participate in the design and implementation of natural 
resource governance. There is also some evidence of spill-over 
effects in countries that enact conservation policies, for example 
by increasing cereal imports from elsewhere (Rudel et al. 2009). 
Protection in a given area has also been found to contribute to 
deforestation on the adjacent land to which displaced human 
populations have moved (Wittemyer et al. 2008). Despite the 
growing area of land with protected status – currently almost 
13 per cent of the planet’s terrestrial area is under some degree 

of protection (Chapter 5) – policy makers should not rely solely 
on this mechanism to preserve natural resources (Ostrom and 
Cox 2010). Instead, they should develop capacity for adaptive 
management strategies that produce the best institutional fit 
for natural resource problems while taking into consideration 
the need to protect local property rights and local livelihoods. 

The separation of consumption from 
the impacts of production
Urbanization and globalization contribute to the separation 
between places where resources and goods originate and 
where products are consumed. Recent research suggests that 
the spatial distance between production and consumption is 
both significant and growing (Erb et al. 2009). As a result, many 
of the ecological costs of consumption are borne by people 
and places increasingly far from consumption sites. While 
urbanization draws people into densely populated spaces and 
concentrates demand for food, materials and consumer products, 
globalization and trade facilitate the movement of people and 
goods, making both regional and international transfers of 
resources and finished products possible. Large-scale land 
acquisitions to supply food, fodder and other forest products as 
well as other natural resources to markets in distant countries 
are both a recent outcome of and a contributor to the separation 
of production and consumption (Toulmin et al. 2011). If carefully 
planned and managed, urbanization and globalization can 
present opportunities to increase efficiency of resource use.

Drivers of increased separation 
Urbanization affects land use and land cover, water use and 
biodiversity at local and regional scales through social processes 
that drive consumption patterns and material demands. Higher 
purchasing power among many urban workers contributes to 
improved quality of life, but at the cost of new challenges for 
natural resources and environmental management. For example, 
Western-style diets are increasingly being adopted globally in 
urban areas (Pingali 2006). Similarly, improved urban lifestyles 
are accompanied by higher consumption of water and energy 
and increased carbon emissions. These urban consumption 
patterns intensify stresses on distant as well as local ecosystems. 

Globalization is not new, but its current iteration has some 
distinct features (Chapter 1). Lower trade barriers, improved 
communication technologies and relatively cheap transport have 
all encouraged countries to become increasingly specialized in 
their economic activities and reliant on international trade to 
connect products and services with distant markets (Gibbon et 
al. 2008). While international trade can make use of strategic 
advantages to produce goods in an efficient way, it also makes 
it easier to externalize both environmental and social costs. 
The well-being of individuals in one place is often based on 
the degradation of the environment elsewhere, for example by 
non-renewable resource extraction. Meanwhile, both resources 
and pollution are embedded in trade (Chapter 4), and countries 
that place greater emphasis on free-market economic policies 
have been linked to higher levels of environmental degradation 
(Özler and Obach 2009). The challenge for the global economy

in Argentina and Brazil, and the planting of jatropha in Ghana 
and India, amongst other developments (Franco et al. 2010). The 
emerging pattern of production in these newly opened sites is 
large-scale, industrial monoculture (Novo et al. 2010; Richardson 
2010). Even in cases where contract growing with smallholders is 
promoted as a key component of new enterprises, monoculture 
and industrial production methods are adopted, for example 
in the oil palm sector in Indonesia (McCarthy 2010). 

In theory the term marginal lands, often applied to land 
deals, refers to lands that are far from road networks, are 
not irrigated, and are not used for intensive commercial 
agriculture. However, in practice there are indications that 
land deals have encroached on prime agricultural lands, 
suggesting that investors do not want to invest in lands with 
little access to water sources or transport infrastructure. 

Displacement of local, including indigenous, people is a potential 
outcome of these land deals. This becomes a problem if people 
have nowhere go to seek employment or construct livelihoods 
(Li 2011). This has happened in several sites of current land 
deals, pushing people to further crowd urban spaces or into 
more fragile environments such as remaining forest, higher 
slopes or river banks. For example, in the Democratic Republic 
of the Congo, large-scale agricultural investment has reportedly 
pushed local farmers into a national park (Deininger et al. 2011). 
But not all land deals have led, or will lead, to dispossession. 
Different outcomes of land deals for the rural poor are illustrated 
by McCarthy (2010) in Jambi, Indonesia, where three villages 
showed three broad trajectories: dispossession, relatively 
successful incorporation into the oil palm enclave, and adverse 
incorporation with precarious employment and livelihoods.

There are competing views on how to respond. One 
position argues that land deals offer both opportunities 
and threats, and that opportunities can be harnessed and 
threats managed by promoting a voluntary land-deal code 
of conduct (Deininger 2011). In contrast, proponents of 
minimum human rights principles argue that voluntary codes 
may be insufficient to ensure that agricultural investment 
“benefits the poor in the South, rather than leading to a 
transfer of resources to the rich in the North” (De Schutter 
2011). An in-between position is reflected in the Voluntary 
Guidelines for the Democratic Governance of Natural 
Resources promoted by FAO, which, unlike corporate-
led codes of conduct, bind member states to mandatory 
reporting. How these viewpoints unfold remains to be seen. 

Land governance
Many of the challenges for sustainable land management stem 
from underlying weaknesses in land governance systems. 
Generally, there are three components of a governance system: 
actors and organizations, institutions, and practices (GFI 2009). 
Incompatibility between these is one of the most common 
reasons for the lack of successful transition from resource-
extractive to sustainable management of land resources. For 
example, various countries have redirected their policies and 

Yasuni National Park on the fringes of the Amazon Basin in Ecuador 
– believed to be the single most biodiverse place on the planet – has 
come under severe threat following the discovery of rich oil deposits 
beneath the park’s rivers. In December 2011, US$116 million payment 
for ecosystem services was raised by crowd-sourcing, temporarily 
halting ecological devastation and the release of more than 400 million 
tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2). © Sebastian Liste

is to encourage the best of what it can offer in terms of efficient 
resource use while taking measures to reduce the occurrence, 
concentration and transfer of environmental and social costs. 

Land deals 
Recent changes in production patterns can be linked to the 
convergence of food, energy, environmental and financial 
crises, and a continuing surge in the mineral and timber 
industries (Tables 3.2 and 3.4; Chapter 1). These interactions 
have brought corporations and some national governments, 
based in the global North and South, to forge widespread 
land deals, sometimes referred to as land grabs, in distant 
countries. The UN Committee on Food Security suggests that 
such large-scale land acquisition now involves close to 100 
million hectares (Toulmin et al. 2011). Concentrated in the 
global South, these land deals are intended to produce food, 
feed, biofuels, timber and minerals, usually for export. This 
ongoing global rush for land is altering land-use patterns and 
social relations, and involves a new combination of people 
and pressures. Given the rapid pace of recent developments 
and projected growth in demands for food, feed, biofuels and 
materials, it is likely to have major impacts on future land use. 

The 2007–2008 food price spike inspired multi-sectoral investors 
to purchase or lease land for food production and export (Toulmin 
et al. 2011). At the same time, biofuel blending requirements in 
the EU and many other countries have provided another impetus 
for external land deals and land-use change. This has directly 
and indirectly inspired the expansion of oil palm plantations 
in Colombia, Guatemala, Indonesia and Malaysia, sugar cane 
ethanol production in Brazil and Southern Africa, soy cultivation

management rules towards sustainable forest management, but 
due to structural and cultural resistance in forestry organizations, 
management practices have not changed to the expected level 
(Kumar and Kant 2005). Other common features of poor land 
governance are low levels of transparency, accountability and 
participation in decision making, and a lack of capacity amongst 
the actors and organizations responsible for land management.

Land governance includes structures ranging from totally 
centralized to completely decentralized. A major challenge 
is to find the best governance system, which depends on 
existing governance alongside the social, economic and 
environmental conditions and their dynamics (Kant 2000). 

Market-based approaches 
Heightened interest in carbon sequestration has inspired 
new incentives and financing for ecosystem protection. Local 
and global initiatives have started to invest in market-based 
climate approaches that attach a financial value to the carbon 
stored in forests, offering incentives for developing countries 
to invest in low-carbon development. One such opportunity – 
Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation 
(REDD) in developing countries – has emerged as an important 
component of a global strategy to reduce emissions while 
generating financial flows from North to South (Scharlemann 
et al. 2010; Angelsen 2009). Since its inception, REDD has 
evolved into REDD+, which now goes beyond deforestation 
and forest degradation to include conservation, sustainable 
forest management and enhancement of forest carbon stocks. 
Evidence of the potential for carbon sequestration in drylands 
and grasslands is accumulating in support of REDD+ programmes 
for these ecosystems as well as forests (Neely et al. 2009).

At this stage, REDD+ has not been incorporated into any 
formal international carbon market, but it is likely to form a key 
element of a post-Kyoto climate change treaty by promoting 
the avoidance of deforestation and allied measures as eligible 
activities for countries seeking to meet their obligations. 
Carbon offset payments would encourage developing countries 
to reduce national deforestation rates, while REDD+ could 
include incentives to promote afforestation, reforestation 
and improved forest management. Research suggests that 
when appropriate techniques are used, forest restoration is a 
cost-effective means of sequestering carbon while providing 
abundant social and ecological benefits (Sasaki et al. 2011). 

Proponents from both science and policy believe that REDD+ 
will not just conserve forests; they also consider it one of the 
most cost-effective carbon abatement options worldwide 
(Corbera et al. 2010; Dickson and Osti 2010; Sikor et al. 2010; 
UN-REDD 2010; Kindermann et al. 2008; Thoms 2008). With 
the right safeguards in place, REDD+ could offer crucial new 
incentives for achieving sustainable development goals – which 
have proved elusive since the 1992 Rio Earth Summit – by 
simultaneously enabling biodiversity conservation, watershed 
protection, capacity building in tropical forest nations and 
poverty alleviation for rural communities (Sikor et al. 2010). 

Much of the debate around REDD+ has focused on its 
international aspects. However, its success will largely depend 
on allocating benefits at the local to national levels and creating 
domestic safeguards to prevent perverse incentives and the 
marginalization of forest-dependent communities (Phelps et 
al. 2010; Cotula and Mayers 2009; Daniel and Mittal 2009). To 
this end, some stakeholders are concerned that REDD+ could 
pose new risks to already vulnerable populations through 
restricted access to land, tenure insecurity, conflict over 
resources, centralization of power, and distortion effects in 
local economic systems. These observers caution that REDD+ 
will only achieve lasting results if it is suitable for adaptation 
to the particular circumstances of relevant countries and can 
meet the needs of local people while building their capacity 
(IUCN 2010/11; Mayers et al. 2010; Preskett et al. 2008).

The risks and opportunities for REDD+ will depend on several 
factors, including how it will be financed and implemented. Many 
challenges are shared by forest countries, but responses and 
solutions will often have to be developed according to country-
specific and local characteristics. Ultimately, if REDD+ is to be 
successful, it must generate substantial revenues to implement 
conservation and sustainable forest management while 
supporting rural poverty reduction and livelihoods. At the same 
time, it must recognize the dynamic complexity of global systems, 
where cause and effect are often distant in time and space. 

Land management and decentralization
Governance plays a major role in how land resources are 
monitored and used and how environmental protection 
is enforced. Proponents of decentralized natural resource 
management suggest that giving local-level officials greater 
responsibilities should result in more efficient, flexible, 
equitable, accountable and participatory governance (Blair 
2000). Local-level decision makers often know more about 
local conditions and are therefore well positioned to develop 
new management solutions. This is important from the 
perspective of adaptive management and providing decision 
makers with the flexibility to quickly develop solutions to 
unforeseen problems (Ostrom 2007). But decentralization is 
only effective if local governments have the financial resources 
and technical capacity to monitor environmental change 
(Andersson 2004). Positive outcomes from decentralized 
environmental governance are also unlikely in the absence 
of public participation in local government decision making 
(Larson 2002; Blair 2000); this emphasizes the importance 
of developing the capacity of local-level stakeholders 
in the sustainable management of land systems. 

Capacity building for sustainable land management 
Capacity building recognizes the knowledge systems, perspectives 
and values of all stakeholders and uses an in-depth understanding 
of how a resource system functions. As sustainable land 
management requires a different set of organizational, technical, 
economic, environmental and managerial skills from that of 
many land managers, building the capacity of all actors and 
organizations can be central to its successful integration.

Box 3.7 Sustainable dryland management

Promising management strategies for dryland ecosystems 
across the world include afforestation to counteract chronic 
carbon loss due to land degradation, with successful 
examples in Israel (Tal and Gordon 2010), Iran (Amiraslani 
and Dragovich 2011) and eastern Uganda (Buyinza et al. 
2010). Other progressive strategies for adaptively managing 
drylands include planting resilient nitrogen-fixing crops 
(Saxena et al. 2010), dune stabilization measures, run-
off control, improved range management and integrated 
land management, for example Iran’s National Plan to 
Combat Desertification. Programmes that build community 
resilience through watershed restoration in drylands, such 
as the Watershed Organization Trusts in India, are also 
promising, as are models of polycentric adaptive governance 
increasingly adopted in Australia (Marshall and Smith 2010; 
Smith et al. 2010). Enhanced monitoring programmes based 
on vegetation indices and real-time climatic data are also 
important in allowing for early-warning and management 
interventions (Veron and Paruelo 2010). 

Land degradation in dryland ecosystems provides an example 
where the lack of capacity – scientific, technical and collaborative 
– limits success in addressing environmental problems. 
Degradation in dryland systems is driven by multiple causes 
and characterized by complex feedbacks that are made worse 
by global climate change (Ravi et al. 2010; Verstraete et al. 
2009). Despite concerted efforts and a wide array of initiatives 
(Box 3.7), drylands continue to be threatened because of lack of 
agreement on the underlying driving mechanisms, characteristics 
and consequences of degradation (Reynolds et al. 2007). Long-
term harmonized data are necessary not only to understand 
the root causes of observed changes, but also to forecast and 
disentangle those, possibly irrevocable, impacts of global change 
from the often more temporary or local variability induced by 
other human activity. These data gaps, and the subsequent 
lack of capacity and common strategies among dryland 
nations, can severely hamper progress towards internationally 
agreed goals on dryland conservation and rehabilitation.

OUTLOOK
Complex forces are affecting land resources, some at dramatic 
rates of change and with diverse regional and national 
characteristics. Certainly some land conversion trends are 
on an unsustainable trajectory, as global population growth 
and rising consumption exert ever greater pressures on 
land. Continued deforestation, wetland conversion and 
dryland degradation are of particular concern. An increasing 
portion of the pressure on tropical forests is shifting from 
the activities of small household farms to large industrial 
plantations producing soy, meat and dairy products, palm oil, 
sugar cane and other products destined for global markets 
(DeFries et al. 2010, 2008). Land degradation continues to 

hamper soil productivity and ecological functions in many 
regions. At the same time, there is significant potential to 
reduce greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural production 
(Smith et al. 2007). Two phenomena that have arisen since 
GEO-4 are the expansion of biofuel production and a growing 
number of land deals in developing countries. These and 
other processes are unfolding rapidly. While their longer-term 
implications remain uncertain, early evidence of their social and 
environmental consequences should be closely considered. 
In combination, these processes are seriously affecting the 
environment in several regions and require urgent attention.
 
Data and monitoring gaps
One key to avoiding environmental damage is to effectively 
monitor environmental trends, yet major data gaps limit the ability 
to avert unwanted outcomes. Global data on land degradation 
have not been updated for a long time, although new estimates 
using satellite material are being developed. Datasets exist for 
land cover but do not always adequately represent areas that 
have experienced selective cutting or other types of modification. 
Forest cover losses in boreal and temperate forests are not as 
well studied as those in tropical forests, while evidence is still 
emerging of the significant carbon sequestration potential of 
rangelands and grasslands. Records of ecosystem change are 
improving, mainly through remote sensing, but reliable data on 
land-use change are still fragmented and often not comparable 
– the extent of drylands, for example, is uncertain because 
of the classifications and methodologies used by different 
programmes. Similarly, there are discrepancies between a number 
of wetland inventories (Ramsar Convention Secretariat 2007) 
and there is no comprehensive global wetlands database. 

Satellite remote sensing is an essential tool for monitoring 
global land resources, but no such technology exists for 
population patterns. National census efforts, the best current 
technique, are sporadic and underfunded in many countries, 
and there is a significant data gap for population changes in 
rural areas. Further, it is critical to track the consequences 
for the environment of rapid and extensive urbanization, 
with its uncertain implications for land resources.

Data on biofuels – including the extent of production and 
use – are incomplete at the global level, although national 
datasets can be found for some countries. Similarly, there is 
a need for improved national and global monitoring of land 
transactions including large-scale land deals. There are also 
few standard indicators that governments can use to monitor 
the environmental impacts of different patterns of land tenure. 
Finally, standard methodologies for the badly needed valuation 
of ecosystem services are at an early stage of development.

Goal gaps
Table 3.5 summarizes progress toward the themes expressed 
in internationally agreed goals on land use and conservation. 
However, some important topics are not reflected in them. 
For example, there are no goals or targets that reflect the 
vulnerabilities and challenges specific to the polar regions.

Issues of capacity building and stakeholder participation are 
also inadequately represented in international goals. Several 
of the land-related goals that do exist lack quantifiable targets, 
complicating the task of assessing progress towards their 
achievement. A particular challenge is to acknowledge the 
interactions between different components of social-ecological 
systems at different scales. 

Goals cannot be considered in isolation. Due to tensions and 
synergies, progress towards one goal must be viewed in light 
of implications for others. For example, Figure 3.10 highlights 
friction between MDG 1 on reducing hunger and MDG 7 on 
environmental sustainability: if food production is increased 
through agricultural expansion, it directly compromises 
the protection of forests, wetlands and other ecosystems. 
Meanwhile, efforts to address the education and health issues 
expressed in MDGs 2–6 can indirectly help achieve MDGs 1 
and 7 in the long term. Thus, an integrated perspective on goal 
achievement is crucial. 

Discussion of key issues 
Economic growth and land resources
The global economy has quadrupled during the last 25 years 
(IMF 2006), but 60 per cent of the world’s major ecosystem 

goods and services underpinning livelihoods have been 
degraded or used unsustainably (MA 2005a). This means 
that traditional economic growth cannot be the foundation 
of sustainable development. A new paradigm of economic 
welfare is required – one that is focused on improving human 
welfare and social equity, and reducing environmental risks and 
ecological scarcities. One such approach, the green economy 
proposed by UNEP in 2010, includes: 
•	 valuation	of	natural	resources	and	environmental	assets;	
•	 pricing	policies	and	regulatory	mechanisms	that	translate	
these values into market and non-market incentives; and 
•	 measures	of	economic	welfare	that	are	responsive	to	the	

use, degradation and loss of ecosystem goods and services 
(UNEP 2011b). 

The transition from traditional economic growth to the green 
economy will require changes to national regulations, policies, 
subsidies, incentives and accounting systems, as well as 
to global legal and market infrastructures, an appropriate 
international trade structure and targeted development aid. 

Meeting the growing demand for food 
Both global population and per-person consumption continue 
to grow. The achievement of MDG 1, the eradication of extreme  

90

Part 1: State and Trends

hunger and poverty, will require getting more food to more 
people. How this is accomplished will have important 
implications for MDG 7 – environmental sustainability. 
Population growth is an important part of this complex 
interaction, but changing lifestyles and consumption patterns, 
particularly the increasing global demand for animal products, 
are also significant. Friction between these two MDG goals could 
be reduced by:
•	 improving	efficiency	along	the	whole	food	chain	by	increasing	

crop yields through research and extension, and reducing 
food waste and spoilage by improving transport, storage 
and distribution infrastructure in developing countries and 
changing behaviour in wealthier societies, where much food 
waste occurs in food retail markets and homes; 

•	 implementing	full-cost	accounting	for	food	products	

that reflects the environmental and social costs of their 
production in order to facilitate a shift in consumption 
patterns; 

•	 encouraging,	where	appropriate,	innovative	approaches	to	
food production to shorten food supply chains and enhance 
food security; 

•	 evaluating	the	ecosystem	service	and	carbon	balance	

implications of potential biofuel production to inform land-
use planning and management, and reducing competition 
between food and biofuel production, particularly in areas 
with the highest crop production potential. 

Growing demand for non-food resources
Crop- and plantation-based biofuel production has increased 
rapidly in recent years and the land-use transitions associated 
with this could have strong environmental and social impacts. 
Fuel-blending targets in numerous countries mandate the 
continued expansion of biofuel production. Next-generation 
biofuels – from, for example, algae or cellulose – are still  
under development and are not likely to contribute a significant 
share of biofuel production in the near future. Governments 
should recognize that targets for biofuel production have both 
direct and indirect implications for land use at national and 
global scales.

Large-scale land acquisitions are growing with potentially major 
impacts on land-use change and social relations. Recent reports 
have advocated the establishment of an observatory of land 
tenure and rights to food to monitor access to land and ensure 
that land investments result in decreased hunger and poverty 
in host communities and countries (Toulmin et al. 2011). 
United Nations organizations could play an important role in 
creating precedents that could help improve food access 
in developing countries. 

Complexity and policy challenges
An important step towards addressing these challenges is to 
monitor, study and understand how social and biophysical 
drivers interact, and the diversity of social, economic and 
environmental consequences they generate at local, regional and 
global levels. A concerted effort by international organizations, 
the scientific community, and national and local institutions 

could create the comprehensive monitoring network needed to 
achieve this goal – but to be effective there needs to be strong 
coordination between these actors. 

Limitations in the assessment of land-change processes cannot 
and should not delay action to address their driving forces, with 
the precautionary principle being applied to reduce their negative 
impacts. Current evidence of their consequences highlights the 
need to act in the short term to avoid potentially irreversible 
negative outcomes in the long term. There are no easy answers 
to these complex problems, and single and isolated actions 
might achieve only limited positive outcomes rather than broad 
solutions. New governance approaches to land management 
could help incorporate adaptive management, capacity building 
and more efficient valuation of ecosystem services and natural 
resources by combining market-based tools with a bigger role for 
community agency and bottom-up approaches. New governance 
approaches could also help foster the changes in consumption 
patterns needed to reduce pressure on land systems and create 
better knowledge and awareness of the multiple values of 
ecosystems. While the leadership of UN organizations and other 
international institutions is a central element in these efforts, 
governments have a crucial role, responsibility and opportunity 
to act as agents of change.

New governance approaches could foster the changes in consumption 
patterns needed to reduce pressure on land systems and create better 
knowledge and awareness of the multiple values of ecosystems.

Main Messages 

Increasing water-use efficiency in all sectors 
is vital to ensure sustainable water resources 
for all uses. Human water demands, with only 
limited improvements in efficiency, are increasing 
and are already unsustainable in many regions. 
Nevertheless, potential exists for efficiency gains: 
irrigation efficiency, for example, could be increased 
by approximately one-third simply by implementing 
existing technology. At the local level, integrated 
demand and supply strategies are critical. At a river-
basin level, more efficient and fair water allocation 
systems are needed. More broadly, virtual water 
trade can ease water demands in some locations.

Recognition of ecosystem water needs within 
allocation systems will help protect life-
supporting ecosystem services. Freshwater and 
marine ecosystem services are critical to human 
development and integral to the transition to a 
green economy. Inadequately articulated objectives 
and lack of data, however, make it difficult to 
evaluate progress in meeting environmental water 
requirements. Better strategies and tools are 
needed for efficient, equitable water allocation 
between users, including the environment. Full 
implementation of international commitments and 
enforcement of legally binding agreements, and due 
consideration of customary water-use arrangements, 
will facilitate sustainable human and ecosystem use. 

Reducing both point and non-point pollution is 
imperative to improve ecosystem health and provide 
safe water for humans. Substantial achievements in 
reducing some pollutants have occurred since 1992, 

although many water bodies are still affected, and 
many new contaminants have poorly understood 
effects. Treating municipal and industrial wastewater is 
achievable with existing technology, but requires better 
regulatory oversight, infrastructure investment and 
capacity building, especially in developing countries. 
Integrated land-water management and stakeholder 
participation are necessary to reduce non-point 
pollution of both freshwater and marine systems. 

Improved water supply and sanitation is probably 
the single most cost-effective means of reducing 
water-related death and disease globally. Although 
the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) target 
on water supply was met in 2010, more than 600 
million people will still lack access to safe drinking 
water in 2015. The MDG target on sanitation is 
unlikely to be met, with 2.5 billion people currently 
without improved sanitation facilities; poor rural 
populations are most affected. Meeting the water 
supply and sanitation MDGs would reduce the 
water-related global disease burden by about 10 
per cent. Increased investment in infrastructure, 
capacity building and regulation are needed, and 
the participation of women is crucial for water 
management and the prevention of water- 
borne disease.

Climate-sensitive policies across all water-related 
sectors are essential to address extreme events and 
increased climatic variability. Floods and droughts 
still cause losses of billions of dollars annually. 
Climate change is altering the hydrologic cycle, 
threatening freshwater and marine ecosystems as

well as human water security in many regions. Open 
oceans play a major role in regulating global climate 
and weather patterns, with climate change impacts 
manifested in warmer surface waters and rising sea 
levels. Ocean warming and acidification threaten 
tropical coral reef ecosystems, with rapid contraction 
predicted by 2050. Mitigation and adaptation to 
climate change impacts must be considered within 
the context of other drivers and pressures. Those 
related to energy production are likely to require 
trade-offs between human energy needs, water 
demands and ecosystem protection.

The pace of increasing demands on freshwater 
and ocean resources must be matched by 
improved governance. Freshwater systems 
integrate human activities and land management 
across nations and regions. The open oceans are 
a major global commons and require effective 
international cooperation and governance. Most 
human and environmental water problems result 
from inadequate governance involving policy, 
institutional, financial and/or stakeholder issues. 
Integrated management approaches for addressing 
these constraints require time and resources to 
be successful. They need enhanced integration 
of policies and institutions between sectors and 
governance levels, implementation and enforcement 
of relevant agreements and goals, improved 
monitoring and resolution of transboundary issues. 
Good governance, including stakeholder and private-
sector participation and gender considerations, is 
critical to increasing societal and environmental 
resilience and sustainability.

INTRODUCTION
Aquatic ecosystems are major integrators of natural and 
anthropogenic processes. As the ultimate sink for pollutants, 
freshwater and marine ecosystems are among the most sensitive 
indicators of the environmental impacts of human activities. They 
support a wide diversity of life (Chapter 5), providing important 
goods and services that directly or indirectly support and sustain 
human existence and livelihoods. Adequate freshwater supplies 
of acceptable quality are recognized as a human right by the UN 
General Assembly’s declaration on clean water and sanitation. 

As highlighted in the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA 
2005), freshwater and marine ecosystems provide various services, 
including provisioning (food, water, fibre, fuel), regulating (climate, 
hydrological, purification), cultural (spiritual, recreational), and 
supporting (sediment transport, nutrient cycling). Such ecosystem 
services are a function of water, land, biodiversity and atmospheric 
links. Healthy aquatic ecosystems not only provide goods and 
services, but also enhance resilience against the negative impacts of 
environmental perturbations or disasters. Aquatic systems also 
drive major global bio-geochemical cycles; the open oceans play 
a major role in regulating global climate and weather patterns. 

This chapter addresses freshwater and marine systems as distinct 
but linked hydrological components of the water environment. 
It assesses progress towards achieving water-related goals in 
major multilateral environmental agreements identified by the 
GEO-5 High-Level Intergovernmental Advisory Panel and regional 
consultations. Based on the drivers-pressures-states-impacts-
responses framework (DPSIR) (Stanners et al. 2007) used for 
the GEO-5 assessment, this chapter focuses on the state, 
trends and impacts of the water environment, with references 
to drivers (Chapter 1) and responses (Parts 2 and 3), and other 
environmental sectors (Chapters 2, 3, 5 and 6) where appropriate.

Although freshwater ecosystem goods and services are extensive, 
competition and multi-sectoral demands for water have resulted 
in overexploitation and contamination of resources in many 
regions. Competing water uses and their impacts on sustainable 
aquatic resources, including quantity and quality issues, are 
discussed, including the water needs of ecosystems. The chapter 
also addresses inequitable and unsustainable water demands in 
many countries. Pollution from land- and marine-based activities 
(Chapter 6) continues to degrade coastal areas and open oceans. 
Water quality trends are discussed. Continuing overfishing severely 
impacts many fish stocks, particularly marine species (Chapter 5). 

Many predicted global climate change impacts will be manifested 
in changes to the hydrologic cycle. How they could affect the 
water environment is highlighted, including increased frequency, 
duration and severity of droughts and floods. Predicted climate 
change impacts and their uncertainties are discussed, including 
the vulnerabilities and adaptation needs of many communities. 

Watersheds comprise a group of linked water systems that can 
include rivers, lakes, reservoirs, wetlands, underlying aquifers 
and downstream marine systems, although these links are often

not considered in developing water management plans. This is a 
significant omission, since simultaneously managing for human 
health and social concerns – including disease and poverty, 
economic development and sustainable environmental integrity – 
within complex global connectivity often requires environmental 
and economic trade-offs, some very difficult. Because many 
water-related problems result from policy, institutional, financial 
or other governance inadequacies, this chapter also discusses 
both freshwater and marine governance elements identified 
in the multilateral environmental agreements. It concludes by 
identifying major policy and data gaps for achieving water-related 
goals. Policy options to address the issues raised in this chapter 
are addressed throughout Part 2 of GEO-5.

INTERNATIONALLY AGREED GOALS
Freshwater was selected as a priority issue in all UNEP GEO-5 
regional scoping consultations, with most regions identifying 
Paragraph 26c of the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation 
(Box 4.1) as the most important freshwater goal, with water 
availability and marine issues also identified in several regions. 
Although limited by gaps in global-scale data and specific targets, 
the degree to which water-related multilateral environmental 
agreements have been addressed is a focus of the current chapter. 

Goals were identified on the basis of their policy relevance and 
ability to illustrate intergovernmental cooperation since the 
United Nations Conference on Environment and Development 
(UNCED) in 1992 and earlier (Table 4.1). 

Box 4.1 Johannesburg Plan of Implementation 
Paragraph 26c

Improve the efficient use of water resources and promote their 
allocation among competing uses in a way that gives priority 
to the satisfaction of basic human needs and balances 
the requirement of preserving or restoring ecosystems and 
their functions, in particular in fragile environments, with 
human domestic, industrial and agriculture needs, including 
safeguarding drinking water quality.

STATE AND TRENDS
Water scarcity 
Human-environment competition for scarce water resources
Water scarcity is a significant and increasing threat to the 
environment, human health, development, energy security 
and the global food supply (Pereira et al. 2009). Ecosystems, 
which provide life-supporting goods and services (Chapter 5), 
suffer from multiple pressures, including the need for water of 
adequate quantity and quality as well as appropriate timing 
(environmental flows). The indicator used here is blue water 
scarcity (Figure 4.1), the proportion of groundwater and surface 
water consumed relative to the sustainable water available for 
human use, after accounting for environmental flows (Hoekstra 
and Mekonnen 2011). Water scarcity is a significant factor in 
human water security, with a fifth of the global population living 
in areas with physical water scarcity (Comprehensive Assessment 
of Water Management in Agriculture 2007). 

Falkenmark and Rockström (2004) estimated the water required to 
maintain ecosystem goods and services as 75 per cent of the total 
water use, while direct human water use represented 25 per cent 
of the total. These figures include both blue (groundwater and 
surface water) and green water (water stored in the soil). Water is 
overcommitted in many places, leaving insufficient resources for 
both human and environmental needs (Gleick and Palaniappan 
2010). In a study of 424 of the world’s major river basins, 
containing a population of 3.9 billion people, environmental flow 
requirements were violated in 223 basins, containing 2.67 billion 
people facing severe water scarcity during at least one month of 
the year (Figure 4.1) (Hoekstra and Mekonnen 2011). Although 
arid regions of Northern Africa and the Middle East are not 
included in this analysis, other data suggest that the proportion of

renewable water withdrawn in those regions exceeds 50–75 per 
cent, leaving little environmental flow (FAO 2008). 

Although many goals in the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation 
acknowledge the importance of marine and coastal ecosystems 
(WSSD 2002), there is less recognition of water needs to support 
freshwater ecosystems, which are themselves legitimate 
water users (Chapter 5). Although the importance of formally 
recognizing the environment as a legitimate water user is 
increasing, it remains on a relatively small scale in practice, with 
many aquatic ecosystems still at risk (Garrick et al. 2009).

Part 1: State and Trends

Water demand
Global withdrawals have tripled over the last 50 years (UNESCO 
2009) to meet the demands of a growing population with 
increasing wealth and consumption levels. While water supply 
over this period has remained relatively constant, demand now 
exceeds sustainable supply in many places, with serious  
long-term implications (2030 Water Resources Group 2009).  
The planetary boundary for human consumptive blue water use – 
when used groundwater and surface water is not made available 
for reuse in the same basin – is estimated to be 4 000 km3 per 
year, with current consumptive blue water use estimated at 
approximately 2 600 km3 per year. Projected water demands 
may to reach planetary boundaries in the coming decades 
(Rockström et al. 2009).

Agricultural, industrial and domestic water withdrawals have 
steadily increased. Agriculture is by far the largest global water user 
(Figure 4.2), with withdrawals for this purpose being unsustainable 
in many places due to unbalanced long-term irrigation water 
budgets (MA 2005), as evidenced by the mining of aquifers and 
reliance on large water diversion projects. These withdrawals are 
projected to continue increasing, placing further pressure on aquatic 
ecosystems, which themselves also require water of adequate 
quantity, quality and timing for sustained health.

in many regions. Between 1960 and 2000, global groundwater

withdrawal increased from 312 km3 to 734 km3 per year, 
resulting in groundwater depletion increasing from 126 km3 to 
283 km3 per year (Wada et al. 2010). Many globally important 
agricultural centres are particularly dependent on groundwater, 
including northwest India, northeastern China, northeast 
Pakistan, California’s Central Valley, and the western United 
States (Figure 4.3) (Wada et al. 2010). 

Not all water withdrawals result in consumptive water use, since 
much withdrawn water is returned in the form of wastewater 
or irrigation return flows. Rain-fed agriculture also represents 
significant human water use without direct water withdrawals. 
Global water consumption per person, as measured by the water 
footprint, averages 1 387 m3 per year. North America has the highest 
water footprint at 2 798 m3 per person per year, while Asia and 
the Pacific have the lowest at 1 156 m3 per person per year (Figure 
4.4). Of the total global water footprint, 74 per cent represents 
rainwater stored in soil (green water), 11 per cent represents  
the consumptive use of surface and groundwater (blue water),  
and 15 per cent represents the freshwater required to assimilate 
pollution from all sources (referred to in the water footprint 
terminology as grey water). Agriculture accounts for 92 per cent of 
the total global water footprint; livestock and related products alone 
account for 27 per cent (Chapter 1) (Mekonnen and Hoekstra 2011).
 
 Water use efficiency and the virtual water trade
Since the renewable supply of water is relatively constant, 
addressing water scarcity relies in large part on reducing water 
demand by improving efficiency and reducing consumptive  
water use. All user demands must be considered together, 
including environmental water requirements.

Although improved methods and technologies have produced 
efficiency gains in all sectors in some regions, the need, and 
potential, exists for further improvements to ensure the well-
being of a growing world population while minimizing the 
impacts on ecosystems and their goods and services. 

Sprinkler irrigation systems are usually more efficient than flood 
systems. © Pgiam/iStock

The need and potential for improvement is greatest in the 
agricultural sector (Figure 4.5), since approximately 70 per

cent more food will be needed by 2050 to cope with a growing 
population and dietary changes (Chapter 1) (Boelee 2011). 
Improvements in the application, conveyance, distribution 
and management of irrigation can raise the overall efficiency 
of the water getting to the crops from approximately 35 per cent 

to 75 per cent or more (Rohwer et al. 2007). Broader agricultural 
water-use efficiency strategies include land-water management 
and reuse (Ali 2010), while food supply chains beyond the farm 
can also be more water efficient. 

There is inadequate global data to evaluate the overall state 
and trends of industrial and domestic water-use efficiency. 
Nonetheless, opportunities do exist for significant improvement 
in these sectors, particularly where there are major withdrawals 
and/or rapid urbanization is occurring (Chapter 1). Water 
allocation efficiency is also required at the river-basin level to 
ensure sustainable, equitable and economic water use. 

At national, regional and global scales, the virtual water trade 
– the water embedded in traded products ranging from crops 
to manufactured goods – can be a tool for improving overall 
efficiency by capitalizing on the comparative advantages of 
certain water uses in particular regions. About one-fifth of 
the global water footprint is related to production for export 
(Figure 4.6). The global virtual water trade for agricultural 
and industrial products totalled 2 320 km3 per year between 
1996 and 2005, with crops contributing 76 per cent and 
animal and industrial products each contributing 12 per cent 
(Mekonnen and Hoekstra 2011). The virtual water trade can 
efficiently redistribute water and partially help to address 
the disconnection between consumption and the impacts 
of production (Chapter 3). Water-scarce basins, countries or

regions, for example, can import water-intensive products 
through trade, preserving scarce water resources for more 
valuable purposes. However, it can also lead to overexploitation 
of water resources in net exporter countries, prioritizing 
commodity water needs over basic local needs, especially 

where strong economic drivers promote commodity exports 
(Chapter 1). Another characteristic is that some net virtual 
water exporters, such as Australia or South Asia, are also water 
scarce, while some net importers may have abundant supplies, 
as is the case for Central Europe.

Changes to the hydrologic regime
Extreme events: floods and droughts
The number of flood and drought events classified as disasters 
– when ten or more people are killed, 100 are affected, a 
state of emergency is declared or international assistance is 
requested (EM-DAT 2011) – has risen since the 1980s, as have 
the total area and number of people affected and the level of 
damages (EM-DAT 2011; Rosenfeld et al. 2008; Kleinen and 
Petschel-Held 2007). River channelization, floodplain loss, 
urbanization, particularly in coastal areas, and changing 
land use are major reasons for the increasing impacts of 
floods and droughts as well as growing vulnerability to those 
impacts (Chapter 1). The number of people affected and total 
damages vary significantly, making it hard to identify trends 
with confidence (Lugeri 2010). Vulnerability depends on the 
preparedness and capacity to anticipate and react to extreme 
events. There are varying preparedness levels on a regional 
basis for dealing with sudden-onset (floods) and gradual-onset 
(droughts) disasters (IOM 2010). 

Floods cause loss of life and billions of dollars of damage 
annually (Figure 4.7), with the economic losses higher in 
developed countries due to the financial valuation and insuring 
of assets. Between the 1980s and the 2000s, a 230 per cent rise 
in the number of flood disasters was accompanied by increasing 
levels of damages (Figure 4.7) (EM-DAT 2011). In addition, the 
number of people exposed to floods increased by 114 per cent 
(UNISDR 2011). Over 95 per cent of deaths related to natural 
disasters between 1970 and 2008 occurred in developing 
countries (IPCC 2011) and although governments in South and 
East Asia, for example, increased their disaster preparedness 
levels, the capacity of communities to cope with such extreme

hemisphere and equatorial areas, with many already arid and 
semi-arid areas expected to get drier (IPCC 2007a).

Box 4.6 Dams and river fragmentation

The number of drought disasters rose by 38 per cent between the 
1980s and the 2000s, the number of people affected increased 
and related damages also increased (EM-DAT 2011). Droughts 
disrupt sustainable social and economic development, hindering 
achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), 
and place additional stresses on ecosystems. Communities 
dependent on rain-fed crops, which represent approximately  
70 per cent of global crop production, often have few alternative 
food sources beyond international aid (Portmann et al. 2010). 
This is evidenced by the severe ongoing drought in Eastern Africa 
and the reduction of net primary production in Latin America, 
Africa and South East Asia (Zhao and Running 2010). Droughts 
also affect irrigation and can exacerbate water resource conflicts, 
with arid and semi-arid areas being particularly vulnerable, 
especially in the context of climate change. 

Dams and river fragmentation
Dam building and river control significantly benefit humans, 
providing flood protection, reliable water supplies and 
hydroelectric power. But dams can also have detrimental 
impacts on ecosystems, including channel fragmentation and 
flow modification, altering ecosystem processes and affecting 
aquatic organisms, particularly migratory species. Improved 
management of existing dams to ensure environmental flows 
and retain or create fish passes is important to mitigate conflicts, 
although such measures often fall short as a full remedy (Gleick 
2003). Careful trade-off analyses are necessary to ensure that 
the design, location and operation of new dams minimize 
environmental impacts (Matthews et al. 2011).

Dam density is highest in industrialized countries (Figure 4.8),

recent legislation and public pressure do not support dam

in many developing countries to secure water and electricity

planning should consider any predicted increase in flow 
variability associated with climate change.

manufacturing and other industrial sources. The primary causes 
are inadequate control of these activities and exceedance of the 
natural attenuation capacity of underlying soils and strata (Foster 
et al. 2006). Salinization of overexploited aquifers, especially 
in coastal areas, is another serious concern, particularly for 
communities dependent on groundwater for drinking.
 
Groundwater nitrate concentrations are increasing, especially in 
areas of rapid urbanization, inadequate sanitation and/or heavy 
agricultural fertilizer use. Nitrate in groundwater contributes

to eutrophication and has direct human health impacts. Both 
naturally occurring arsenic and that mobilized by human 
activities threaten drinking water quality in many countries 
(Figure 4.9). Groundwater contaminated with arsenic from 
natural geologic sources affects 35–75 million people. Surface 
water pollution in some regions has led to the development 
of groundwater as a source of drinking water, resulting in 
inadvertently exposing people to these natural sources of  
arsenic (Schwarzenbach et al. 2010; Brunt et al. 2004). 

Pathogenic contamination
Pathogenic contamination of surface and groundwater is a 
critical threat to human health in many areas and contributes 
to water treatment costs in many communities. Using domestic 
sewage collection and treatment as a proxy, microbial 
contamination has decreased over past decades in most 
developed countries. In contrast, microbial pathogens are 
often the most pressing water quality issue in many developing 
countries (Figure 4.10). 

Because human and animal faeces are the primary pathogenic 
sources of water contamination, achieving MDG Goal 7c of 
halving the population without basic sanitation by 2015 will 
help reduce such pollution. Nevertheless, although some 
regions have made significant progress, the world is currently 
not on track to attain this goal (Figure 4.11). Improved 
sanitation continues to bypass the poorest communities

Nutrient pollution and eutrophication
Eutrophication, resulting from excessive nutrient pollution 
from human sewage, livestock wastes, fertilizers, atmospheric 
deposition and erosion (Chapter 3), is a continuing, pervasive 
water quality problem. Although there has been increased

sewage treatment in many areas, much less progress has 
been made in reducing nutrient loads from non-point sources, 
including agricultural and urban run-off and atmospheric 
deposition to freshwater and marine systems. Interference with 
global nutrient cycles may be reaching planetary boundaries, 
beyond which marine and freshwater ecosystems might not 
recover, although specific thresholds for these processes remain 
uncertain (Rockström et al. 2009).
 
Global river nutrient export has increased nutrient export 
has increased by approximately 15 per cent since 1970, 
by approximately 15 per cent, since 1970, with South Asia 
accounting for at least half of the increase (Seitzinger et al. 
2010). There has been a 74 per cent increase in algal and 
macrophyte gross productivity in lakes since 1970 (Lewis 2011), 
and a dramatic increase in the number of eutrophic coastal 
areas since 1990. Under severe eutrophic conditions, algal 
blooms can produce hypoxic conditions, causing fish kills in 
lakes, and dead zones in coastal areas. Hypoxia has become a 
significant and increasing problem in lakes and rivers, estuaries 
and coastal areas around the world (Diaz et al. 2010; Rabalais et 
al. 2010; Diaz and Rosenberg 2008). At least 169 coastal areas 
are considered hypoxic, with dead zones especially prevalent 
in the seas around South East Asia, Europe and eastern North 
America (Figure 4.12). Only 13 coastal areas appear to be 
recovering (Diaz et al. 2010; Rabalais et al. 2010), most in North 
America and northern Europe. Whereas phosphorus loads are 
projected to level off, global river nitrogen loads are likely to

increase by an additional 5 per cent by 2030, mostly in South 
Asia (Seitzinger et al. 2010). 

Nutrients can also cause harmful algal blooms in freshwaters 
and coastal areas, some releasing algal toxins that directly 
affect human health (WHO 2003a), aquatic organisms and 
livestock. The number of reported outbreaks of paralytic 
shellfish poison, a harmful algal toxin found in eutrophic 
waters, increased from fewer than 20 in 1970, to more than 
100 in 2009 (Anderson et al. 2010).

Marine litter 
Litter is found in all the world’s oceans because of poor solid 
waste management and the increased use of plastic (UNEP 
2009). It damages wildlife, fisheries and boats, contaminates 
coastal areas, and presents safety and human health risks. 
Marine litter accumulates on coastal beaches, on the sea bottom 
(Galgani et al. 2000) and large marine gyres in both the Atlantic 
and Pacific Oceans (Law et al. 2010; Martinez et al. 2009).

Of the 12 seas surveyed between 2005 and 2007, the South East 
Pacific, North Pacific, East Asian Sea and Wider Caribbean coasts 
contained the most marine litter (UNEP 2009), and the Caspian, 
Mediterranean and Red Seas the least. Regional studies of the 
Baltic Sea (HELCOM 2009), Northeast Atlantic (OSPAR 2009), 
US coastline (Sheavly 2007) and North Atlantic Subtropical Gyre 
indicated no statistically significant changes in litter quantity 
between 1986 and 2008, while data from the Mid-Atlantic 
indicated an increase in land-based and general-source marine 
litter during 1997–2007 (Ribic et al. 2010). 

Persistent toxic chemicals
Toxic pollutants include the trace metals cadmium, lead 
and mercury, pesticides and their by-products such as 
dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and chlordecone, 
industrial chemicals and combustion by-products. They are still 
used in many places and thus continue to accumulate in aquatic 
systems, leaving a legacy of sediment contamination; they are 
found in 90 per cent of water bodies. The pollutants of greatest 
concern are persistent, toxic and bioaccumulative (Chapter 6). 
Organisms can accumulate contaminants from water, sediment 
and food, acquiring tissue contaminant levels much higher

than those in the surrounding environment. Organochlorine 
compounds such as polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) or DDT 
concentrate in fatty tissues, remain for long periods and 
biomagnify up the food chain, with the highest concentrations 
found in top predators.

Concentrations of many persistent organic pollutants (POPs), 
which tend to accumulate in the Arctic (Hung et al. 2010), have 
decreased in Arctic air samples since the early 1990s (Chapter 2). 
Tissue concentrations of at least three organochlorine chemicals 

in 12 deep-sea fish species in the Western Pacific (Figure 4.13) 
(Oshihoi et al. 2009) and PCB concentrations in at least four fish 
species in San Francisco Bay (Davis et al. 2003) have also fallen 
since the mid-1990s (Chapter 6).

Emerging water quality concerns
Although conventional toxic pollutants are declining in many 
industrialized areas, additional contaminants are raising new 
concerns, for example the use of flame retardants such as 
polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), a type of POP, has 
increased exponentially over the past 30 years in Europe, North 
America and Japan (Schwarzenbach et al. 2010). There are 
also mounting concerns about pharmaceuticals and personal 
care products that are not removed by most sewage systems, 
and thus enter the environment after use. The long-term 
risks to aquatic organisms and humans are largely unknown, 
although it is clear that pharmaceuticals and endocrine-
disrupting compounds can have biological effects at very low 
concentrations (Schwarzenbach et al. 2010). 

Nanoparticles and microplastics are relatively new water 
pollutants (Chapter 6). Nanoparticles – particles measuring 
1–100 nanometres, or billionths of a metre – are increasingly 
used in modern life. An emerging field of nanoecotoxicology is 
examining their environmental fate and potential impacts on 
aquatic ecosystems (Hassellöv et al. 2008; Navarro et al. 2008). 
Microplastics, from the deterioration of plastic objects, may 
contain additives that accumulate in aquatic organisms (GESAMP 
2010; Ryan et al. 2009), and their concentrations, especially in 
marine systems, are expected to follow increases in global plastic 
consumption. Additional types of pollutants about which little is

Invasive species, a form of biological pollution, pose 
great threats to aquatic ecosystems and can cause severe 
environmental and economic damage. Ballast water is a major 
vector for transporting species around the world. The Ballast 
Water Convention of 2004 required the implementation 
of management plans, with open-ocean ballast exchange 
commonly used to reduce introductions. Since this is 
unfeasible in many shipping routes, some countries, including 
Denmark and Australia, have instituted regulations requiring 
ballast water treatment to kill resident organisms.

Although not new, industrial, medical, military and accidental 
releases of radioactive substances are of renewed concern, as

water pollution, because they can all affect the range of human and 
environmental water uses. Despite improvements, lack of access to 
drinking water of adequate quality and quantity remains one of the 
largest human health problems globally. Inadequate water supply is 
an inherently regional phenomenon, however, caused by basin-level 
water scarcity, regional water quality, inadequacies of infrastructure 
and governance, cultural perspectives and inequitable water pricing.

Water security
Although several definitions for water security have been 
proposed since the 1992 Rio Earth Summit, none has been 
universally accepted (Oswald Spring and Brauch 2009). Varying 
definitions, leading to numerous indices based on different 
criteria, make it difficult to generate trend data. The Ministerial 
Declaration of the Hague broadly defines water security to 
include the protection and improvement of freshwater and 
marine ecosystems, sustainable development and political 
stability, with the aim of providing every person with access to 
“enough safe water at an affordable cost to lead a healthy and 
productive life”, as well as protecting vulnerable communities 
from water-related risks and hazards (World Water Council 2000). 

About 80 per cent of the world’s population lives in areas with high 
water security threats, the most severe category encompassing 
3.4 billion people, almost all in developing countries. Water 
security threat here refers to the cumulative effect of 23 drivers 
that have an impact on water resources, categorized into 
watershed disturbance, pollution, water resource development 
and biotic factors (Vörösmarty et al. 2010). More people are 
likely to experience severe water stresses in the coming decades 
because of increased demands (Chapter 1) in addition to altered 
precipitation patterns associated with climate change. 

Figure 4.14 highlights the global threat to human water security 
and compares it with the magnitude of threat after adjusting for 
the effects of previous and current infrastructure investment. 
With higher investments in infrastructure in the industrialized 
countries, the figures show that human water security can be 
increased, overcoming the various threats to water resources 
(Vörösmarty et al. 2010), while low investments in developing 
countries means their water security remains poor. Investments 
must be coupled with adequate institutional capacity, and 
because infrastructure development often occurs at the expense 
of aquatic biodiversity and environmental quality, it is imperative 
that environmental risks related to investments are considered 
and appropriately mitigated.

Equitable access to improved drinking water 
Although water security is an increasing problem in many regions 
of the world, significant progress in access to improved drinking 
water has been made since 1990. However, several regions, 
including most of Africa and other rural areas in developing 
countries, still lack access to improved drinking water sources 
(UNDESA 2010). The UN General Assembly declared access to 
clean water and sanitation as a human right in July 2010, although 
the right is not yet recognized or applied in many countries. 

Recent data suggest that the MDG drinking water target was met 
in 2010 (Figure 4.15). However, there are important inequities 
in this improvement. Whereas only 4 per cent of people in urban 
areas lacked access to improved drinking water in 2010, in rural

Box 4.16 Diarrhoea in children in Africa

 At any given time, over half the world’s hospital beds  
are filled with people suffering from water-related  
diseases (UNDP 2006). Diarrhoeal diseases make up  
more than 4 per cent of the global disease burden,  
90 per cent being linked to environmental pollution  
and lack of access to safe drinking water and sanitation 
(Prüss-Üstün et al. 2008). Africa has the highest burden  
of diarrhoea-related childhood deaths, accounting for  
70 per cent of the 1.3 million deaths of children less than 
five years old in 2008. Not surprisingly, access to basic 
sanitation is also poorest in sub-Saharan Africa, with  
330 million people lacking access to proper sanitation 
(WHO 2011a).

whose vector spends part of its life cycle in water; diseases  
like malaria with water-related vectors; and others such  
as legionellosis carried by aerosols containing certain  
micro-organisms. 

Such diseases are a major public health concern, especially  
in Africa. Globally, diarrhoea related to inadequate sanitation 
and water supply was the second largest contributor to the 
2004 global disease burden, claiming more than 70 million

disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), years lost due to  
ill-health, disability or early death (Box 4.15) (Prüss-Üstün  
et al. 2008). Global health statistics indicate that Africa  
and South Asia contain the areas most severely affected  
by waterborne disease (WHO 2004). 

The WHO is focusing on reducing 25 different water-related 
diseases (WHO 2011a). There have been some notable successes 
in the reduction of onchocerciasis, malaria, schistomiasis and 
cholera. However, globally reported cholera incidence – which 
serves as a proxy where complete data on water-related disease 
trends are lacking – has increased in recent years, mainly in 
Africa (Figure 4.16). In 2009, 45 countries from all continents 
reported 221 226 cases of cholera (Figure 4.16). Water-related 
diseases are a continuing public health problem in developing 
countries lacking access to adequate drinking water and 
sanitation, as further evidenced by the cholera epidemic in Haiti 
following the 2010 earthquake (Walton and Ivers 2011).

Water-energy-climate nexus 
Water, energy, economic development and climatic change are 
interdependent issues. Increases in human population and 
per-person consumption related to economic development drive 
energy demands. Meanwhile the use of fossil fuel energy produces 
greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change, 
which has effects on water, including extreme weather events, loss 
of ice cover, water scarcity and sea level rise. In turn, responses to 
climate change have implications for the water environment. Some

There is a decrease in glacial masses, but not in all regions, and 
decreased snow cover in northern hemisphere regions; peak run-
off from glacier and snowmelt is earlier 

Sea levels increased by about 0.2 metres over the 20th century; a 
rise equivalent to 0.3 metres per century has been recorded since 
the early 1990s, although it is not clear if this is an acceleration 
in long-term sea level rise

Heavy precipitation is projected to increase by 
approximately 7% per oC of temperature rise

seasons; patterns are complex and difficult to predict

Likely increase in average tropical cyclone maximum

forms of solar energy consume significant quantities of water, 
often in arid regions. With increasing water scarcity, some regions 
also rely on desalinization of marine water, requiring large energy 
inputs (World Bank 2009). In addition, droughts have the potential 
to decrease hydropower production (Box 4.21).

Climate change impacts on the water cycle and ocean warming
The hydrologic cycle refers to the continuous movement of water 
through the oceans, atmosphere and over and under land surfaces. 
There is strong evidence that climate change is altering global 
and regional hydrologic cycles (Bates et al. 2008; IPCC 2007a; 
Kundzewicz et al. 2007), with impacts predicted to be manifested 
as changing precipitation patterns, increased intensity of extreme 
weather events and consequent natural disasters, retreating glaciers 
resulting in altered river discharge regimes, and more intense 
droughts in semi-arid regions (Table 4.2) (IPCC 2007b).

Although there is considerable uncertainty regarding projected 
impacts on specific water systems, climate change has the 
potential to seriously affect water management (Bates et al. 2008). 
Nonetheless, the global impacts of other human activities on the 
hydrologic cycle – urbanization, industrialization, water resources 
development – are likely to exceed those related to climate change, 
at least for the next two to three decades (Gordon et al. 2005). 
If climate change impacts are to be addressed, the cost of the 
additional water infrastructure needed by 2030 to provide a 
sufficient quantity of water for all countries is estimated at

risk management and water quality protection (Parry et al. 2009). 
There are signs of increased awareness of mitigation and 
adaptation needs: of 191 water projects funded by the World 
Bank between 2006 and 2008, 35 per cent incorporated 
mitigation and adaptation measures for climate change impacts 
(World Bank 2009). At the same time, however, local and 
regional efforts to increase protection against floods and other 
extreme events are likely to have significant negative impacts on 
aquatic ecosystems themselves. 

The most direct climate change impact on oceans is increased 
sea surface temperature (SST), which has risen by 0.5⁰C 
globally since the 1980s and is predicted to continue increasing 
throughout the 21st century (IPCC 2007a). Global precipitation 
is predicted to increase at a rate of 1–3 per cent per degree 
of surface warming (Wentz et al. 2007), with more extreme 
precipitation events predicted for many tropical and temperate 
regions (IPCC 2011; Gorman and Schneider 2009). 

Melting ice sheets and sea level rise
Sea level rise is caused by ocean thermal expansion and by 
melting glaciers and ice sheets (IPCC 2007a). Although average 
global sea level has remained relatively constant for almost 
3 000 years, it increased by approximately 170 mm during the 20th 
century (IPCC 2007b), and is projected to rise by at least another 
400 mm (+/-200 mm) by 2100 (IPCC 2007a). Measurements from 
1993 to 2008 indicate that sea levels are already rising twice as 
fast as in previous decades (Cazenave and Llovel 2010) and are 
exceeding the rise predicted by climate models. 

Although there is considerably variability associated with these 
and other estimates of sea level rise (Levitus et al. 2009; Ishii 
and Kimoto 2009), 25–50 per cent of sea level rise observed

since 1960 has been attributed to thermal expansion (Cazenave 
and Llovel 2010; Antonov et al. 2005; Willis et al. 2004). Some 
variability may result from water impounded in reservoirs, which 
is estimated to have reduced sea level rise by 30–55 mm over 
the past 50 years (Chao et al. 2008). Small glaciers and ice 
caps exhibited significant mass losses over the 20th century 
(Dyurgerov and Meier 2005) and freshwater run-off from melting 
land-based ice sources will increase in the future. However, with 
losses accelerating over the past 20 years, melting Greenland 
and Antarctic ice sheets have become the biggest contributors 
to sea level rise, and will remain the dominant contributor to 
sea level rise in the 21st century if current trends continue 
(Rignot et al. 2011; Rignot 2008). 

Because of the high concentrations of human populations and 
infrastructure in coastal zones (McGranahan et al. 2007), many 
countries are vulnerable to sea level rise and associated coastal 
and low-lying community flooding (Chapter 7). Developing 
countries, particularly small island developing states (SIDS) 
and deltaic areas, are especially vulnerable (IPCC 2007c), many 
with limited capacity to adapt to rising sea levels or recover from 
associated losses. The estimated costs of coastal adaptation 
range from US$26 billion to US$89 billion per year by the 2040s, 
depending on the magnitude of sea-level rise (World Bank 2010). 

Ocean acidification
The oceans annually absorb a substantial proportion of 
anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2), which reacts with water 
to form carbonic acid, thereby making the ocean more acidic. 
The mean surface ocean pH has already decreased from a pre-
industrial average of about 8.2 to a present value of 8.1, though 
there are regional differences (Figure 4.17; Chapter 2), and Feely 
et al. (2009) project a pH decrease to a mean of about 7.8 by 
2100. Ocean acidification may be approaching the planetary 
boundary (Rockström et al. 2009).

Increased ocean acidity affects marine animals with carbonate 
shells and skeletons, calcareous algae and other organisms 
(Langdon and Atkinson 2005). Affected organisms include reef-
building corals as well as animals critical to ocean food webs, 
including several important human food sources such as crabs

shellfish. It could have a devastating effect on communities dependent

and molluscs. Combined with higher water temperatures, ocean 
acidification is thought to be a major cause of coral bleaching, 
destroying coral reef ecosystems around the world (Hoegh-
Guldberg et al. 2007), with some studies projecting a rapid 
contraction of tropical coral reefs by 2050 (Chapter 5) (Logan 
2010). Coral reefs provide important ecosystem services, such as 
spawning and nursery grounds for some commercially important 
fish species. Impairment of these ecosystems and their services 
are becoming increasingly evident and illustrate the need for 
governance to enhance their protection. 

Impacts of energy development on water resources 
While global data are lacking, the energy sector is believed to 
account for approximately 40 per cent of total water withdrawals 
in the United States and European Union (EU) (Glennie et al. 
2010). Water demands for energy range from extraction and 
processing of raw materials to driving hydropower turbines and 
cooling thermoelectric plants, including nuclear. Fossil fuel 
extraction can also have serious impacts on water quality.

Oil and gas exploration and production can affect both 
freshwater and marine ecosystems. Newly proven technologies 
are accelerating the expansion of new natural gas wells in shale 
gas basins (EIA 2011). Associated water resource impacts are 
currently being researched, including aquifer contamination 
with potentially explosive methane levels (Osborn et al. 2011), 
surface and groundwater contamination, streams receiving 
water discharges (Johnson et al. 2007), and high consumptive 
water use for well drilling and completion (Chapter 7). Oil sand 
exploitation also requires large water volumes and can produce 
severe water pollution (Kelly et al. 2010).

The Deepwater Horizon oil spill of 4.9 million barrels of crude 
oil into the Gulf of Mexico in 2010 was the largest accidental 
marine oil spill in history. Although the economic and 
ecological costs have not yet been fully quantiﬁed, it caused 
extensive damage to marine life, wildlife habitats, ﬁshing 
and tourism. Unlike previous oil spills, in which most of the 
oil dissipated or evaporated, immense underwater plumes 
and thick layers of dissolved oil remained on the seaﬂoor 
in spring 2011, tar balls continued to wash ashore and 
wetlands marsh grass continued to foul and die. 

Oil spills continue to pose an environmental threat, particularly 
to marine ecosystems. Although the number of oil tanker spills 

gas exploration in the Gulf of Mexico is evidence of ongoing 

increasing global oil and gas demands, such o shore activity 
is expected to increase over the next two decades, facilitated 
by the resolution of maritime boundaries and improved access 
to previously inaccessible areas as Arctic ice melts. The Arctic 

but technically recoverable oil and gas resources (Bird et al. 

spills because of its remoteness, harsh physical environment, the 
aggregation of large numbers of marine mammals and the slow 
rate of oil degradation in cold water. 

The most water-intensive form of electricity production is 
biomass, followed by hydropower, oil, coal and nuclear, gas, 
some concentrated solar power systems and geothermal, solar 
photovoltaics, and wind. Exact values vary greatly, depending 
on electricity generation type and location (Glennie et al.
Many forms of concentrated solar power, for example, which may 
be most e ective in arid areas exhibiting high solar energy levels, 
also require signiﬁcant quantities of water for cooling, sometimes 
as much as fossil-fuel-powered plants. There are cases in which 
water scarcity is already a ecting energy production. More than

in Eastern Africa over the past ten years, adversely 
impacting national economies. Low water levels in 
Lake Victoria between 2004 and 2006, for example, 
reduced hydropower output in Uganda by 50 megawatts, 
contributing to a fall in the economic growth rate from 
6.2 per cent to 4.9 per cent over this period (Karakezi  
et al. 2009). 

 
Climate change mitigation policies can also affect water 
demands for electricity production. Capture and storage 
of carbon emissions from coal-fired plants, for example, 
can increase water consumption by 45–90 per cent (Glennie 
et al. 2010). Further, increasing the proportion of electricity 
generated from biomass or some types of concentrated solar 
power is likely to have significant negative impacts on water 
availability, highlighting the need for selecting power 
generation types that use less water and more efficient 
technologies (Chapter 12).
 
Water governance
Water problems frequently translate into inadequacies of  
water governance (RCSE-SU and ILEC 2011; UNESCO 2006), 
as illustrated by many of the water goals laid out in Table 4.1.

Part 1: State and Trends

Adaptive freshwater management and integrated planning 
Agenda 21 of UNCED called for “integrated approaches to 
the development, management and use of water resources” 
(UNCED 1992), subsequently leading to the development of 
several integrated management paradigms, including integrated 
water resources management (Global Water Partnership 
2000), integrated lake basin management (International Lake 
Environment Committee 2006), and integrated coastal zone 
management, as mentioned in the Jakarta Mandate on Marine 
and Coastal Biodiversity (CBD 1997) and other outputs of the 
Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). Integrated management 
approaches also offer a degree of protection against the negative 
impacts of natural disasters such as the devastating earthquake 
and tsunami that struck Japan in 2011.

The need for integrated approaches was formalized in Paragraph 
26 of the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation, which states 
that governments should develop integrated water resources 
management and water efficiency plans by 2005 through actions 
at all levels (WSSD 2002). This overall target has not been met. 
However, data from studies in 2003 and 2005, primarily involving 
developing countries, and for 2008 and 2012 for all countries, 
do suggest significant headway – from the development of plans 
to their implementation – particularly in developed countries 
(Figure 4.19). Progress appears to have slowed, however, in 
developing countries (UN-Water 2012).

Some water professionals and policy makers suggest that in 
some cases the integrated management concept is insufficiently 
specific for practical implementation (Placht 2007; Watson et al.

implementation of integrated water management plans

2007), and is slow to get under way owing to many institutional, 
economic, political and resource constraints (Brauch et al. 
2009; Lansky and Uitto 2005). Further, although integrated 
water management proposes cross-sectoral coordination, all 
relevant government agencies and key water stakeholders may 
not be in agreement (Biswas 2004). Because participatory 
approaches do not always ensure consideration of gender 
perspectives, a systematic assessment of the differing impacts 
of economic development on women and men is also necessary 
to ensure that water issues affecting both genders are part of 
programme planning, implementation and evaluation, including 
ensuring institutional and organizational changes for gender 
equality as an ongoing commitment (Bennett et al. 2005). 
Further, although integrated management can be applied at 
many levels, from village to basin to national to transboundary, 
there are management issues particular to each of these levels 
(Lenton and Muller 2009), necessitating both bottom-up and 
top-down approaches. Existing evidence, however, suggests 
that integrated policies have focused largely on higher-level 
activities such as national policy reforms or the establishment 
of river basin organizations, rather than on on-the-ground 
implementation of integrated management activities at the local 
level (Perret et al. 2006). 

The European Commission (EC) applied integrated water 
resources management principles in its Water Framework 
Directive in 2000, and a flood risk management directive in 
2007. Further, although implicit in goals such as Paragraph 26 
of the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation, there is no global 
multilateral environmental agreement specifically directed 
at aquifer conservation. There are, however, several regional 
groundwater initiatives, including the 2008 establishment of 
the Africa Groundwater Commission (AMCOW 2008). Because 
poor groundwater governance is a major issue, recognizing 
groundwater systems in national laws would be a first step 

towards improved groundwater governance, followed by 
establishing sustainable institutions and financing. 

While social science literature on regional experiences with 
integrated water management and international river basin 
management is increasing, there is little data on the state and 
trends of such approaches, particularly their long-term benefits 
and impacts. Research has focused more on the concept and 
its application, and less on relevant policy implementation, 
highlighting the need for better progress indicators as well as 
continued monitoring frameworks to assess effectiveness (RCSE-
SU and ILEC 2011; UN-Water 2012). Certain policy initiatives 
have supported, inter alia, international river basin regimes, 
and include the Transboundary Water Assessment Programme 
(TWAP), to be implemented by UNEP for the purpose of developing 
a methodology for monitoring and assessing trends regarding, 
among other things, environmental and human water stresses, 
pollution, population density and water system resilience.

Marine governance
Marine systems are a major food source, a means of transport for 
international shipping, a tourism attraction and a climate change 
regulator. Coastal dunes and tidal wetlands are important buffers 
against tidal flooding. A number of international conventions 
have been established to protect the marine environment, 
demonstrating significant levels of international cooperation, 
although a common limitation is their dependence on national 
legislation that may reflect other agendas. 

Regarding international agreements, the 1972 Convention on 
the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and 
Other Matter (the London Convention) and the 1973 International 
Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL) 
address marine pollution. The United Nations Convention on the 
Law of the Sea (UNCLOS 1982), ratified by 160 countries and in 

Water 123

force since 1994, represents a unified approach towards shared 
use of the oceans and their resources, addressing navigation, 
economic rights, pollution, marine conservation and scientific 
exploration. Notwithstanding the concern with increasing 
marine litter, the conventions are generally viewed as positive 
frameworks for controlling and preventing marine pollution. The 
2004 International Convention for the Control and Management 
of Ships’ Ballast Water and Sediments exemplifies collaborative 
actions to address the introduction of alien invasive species, 
which can cause significant environmental and economic damage. 

Another noteworthy international effort is the Global Programme 
of Action for the Protection of the Marine Environment from Land-
based Activities (GPA), adopted by 108 governments and the 
EC in 1995. Although not enforceable, the GPA was designed to 
guide national and regional authorities in undertaking sustained 

action to prevent, reduce and/or eliminate marine degradation 
from land-based activities. Many countries profess to subscribe 
to its goals, providing a means for developing collaborative 
strategies to address coastal and offshore water degradation 
from influent freshwaters. Marine spatial planning, similar to 
land planning or zoning on public lands, is another emerging 
area of possibilities for marine governance.

The regional seas conventions (UNEP and independent 
conventions), other action plans, and the large marine 
ecosystem concept promulgated by the US National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), also represent integrated 
management approaches (Figure 4.20). Development and 
implementation of these plans differ, however, depending on 
the countries involved, with some programme guidelines being 
binding on the participating states while others are not.

The open oceans beyond national jurisdiction comprise almost 
half the planet’s surface, with rapidly advancing technology 
opening major new oceanic frontiers for commercial uses 
including fishing, shipping, resource exploration and for potential 
marine engineering such as deep-ocean CO2 sequestration. The 
open oceans and deep-sea ecosystems, including seamounts, 
trenches and canyons, cold water corals and hydrothermal vents, 
exhibit a wealth of biodiversity. Larger, slow-growing, long-lived 
and heterogeneously distributed species are adapted to stable 
conditions in these environments, and are particularly sensitive 

Figure 4.21 International river basins, 2000

to environmental stresses. Governance of areas beyond national 
boundaries is weak and fragmented, however, and requires 
strengthening in preparation of increasing human activities and 
their impacts on areas within national jurisdictions, as well as to 
ensure conservation and sustainable use of the open oceans. 

Water as a basis for conflict and cooperation
Competition for shared water resources can cause conflicts, 
particularly at the local level, with water needs usually 
immediate, and resources often inadequate to address all 
competing needs. Intrastate conflicts occur between rural and 
urban sectors – such as agricultural, industrial and municipal – 
and between water-reliant livelihood activities – such as fishing, 
agriculture and livestock grazing. Population growth, economic 
development and climate change can exacerbate management 
issues. Further, about 40 per cent of the global population 
lives in transboundary river basins that cover nearly half of 
the Earth’s land surface and provide more than 60 per cent of 
global freshwater flows (Figure 4.21), imparting an additional 
management difficulty. 

There also are increasing incidents of deliberate or threatened 
poisoning of water supplies (Pacific Institute 2011; Greenberg 
2009). Sixty-nine water conflicts were documented for 2000–
2010 in the Water Conflict Chronology List maintained by the 
Pacific Institute, compared to 54 recorded for 1975–1999. 
Although specific incidents were not described in detail, De 
Stefano et al. (2010) found about 67 per cent of 1 831 reported 
water events for 1948–1999 were cooperative, with only 
28 per cent being conflictive in nature; by 2000–2008, the 
proportion of conflictive events had increased slightly, to 33 
per cent. Infrastructure and water quantity were consistently the 
major issues likely to generate conflict (Figure 4.22). Although

water conflicts have occurred in many locations, and disputes 
could increase in the future (Kundzewicz and Kowalczak 2009; 
Greenberg 2009), current evidence suggests greater potential 
for cooperation than for conflict, particularly at the international 
level (De Stefano et al. 2010). 

About 158 of the 263 international freshwater basins still lack 
cooperative management frameworks, while less than 20 per 
cent of the 106 basins with water institutions have multilateral 
agreements in effect (De Stefano et al. 2010). Evidence suggests, 
however, that freshwater systems with established transboundary 
basin organizations can usually improve cooperation, major 
examples including the Lake Victoria basin and the La Plata, 
Mekong and Senegal River basins (Chapter 8). In fact, about 295 
international water agreements have been signed since 1948. 
There are relatively few transboundary groundwater institutions, 
though codification of the law of transboundary aquifers by the 
UN International Law Commission (ILC), adopted by resolution of 
the UN General Assembly in 2008, is a major advance. 

While transboundary basin organizations have facilitated 
so-called hydro-diplomacy, conflict management and dispute 
resolution (Oswald Spring 2007), there also are contrary 
examples. Although water scarcity in the Senegal River basin 
resulted in cooperation, the subsequent building of dams 
precipitated violent conflict (Kipping 2009). Further, with 
population growth and climate change, water scarcity may 
lead to new conflict constellations, including climate-induced 
degradation of freshwater resources, declining food production 
and increased storm and flood disasters, which may further 
undermine food security (WBGU 2008). 

No similar analysis exists for potential conflicts related to 
overfishing and deep-sea mineral exploration in the open 
oceans, although several international agreements identified 
in the section on marine governance address them to varying 
degrees. The sustainable use of coastal areas and ocean 
resources requires effective coordination and cooperation at 
regional and global levels, with examples including UNEP’s 
13 regional seas programmes and the 64 large marine 
ecosystems (Figure 4.20). The EU Marine Strategy Framework 
Directive is another regional instrument, applicable in European 
waters under the jurisdiction of EU Member States that border 
the Baltic, Black and Mediterranean Seas and North-East Atlantic. 
Although the regional seas programmes and large marine 
ecosystems are consistent with UNCLOS and generally reflect the 
targets of the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development 
(WSSD), their achievement status remains unclear. 

OUTLOOK AND GAPS
Freshwater and marine water issues remain high priorities 
globally, as evidenced by the multilateral agreements – including 
conventions and action plans – guiding the scope of this chapter. 
Table 4.3 summarizes trends and, where possible, provides an 
outlook of the state of the water environment, using indicators to 
evaluate progress towards the agreements in Table 4.1.

There has been progress since 1990 in achieving goals directly 
related to human well-being and economic development, 
including access to water supplies and reduction of some toxic 
pollutants threatening human health. Water-related diseases 
and water supply in the rural areas of developing countries, 
however, require increased attention. There has also been 

126

Part 1: State and Trends

progress on water governance with the development of integrated 
water resource management plans and transboundary water 
agreements. However, these plans must now be implemented, 
adequately funded and enforced to improve aquatic ecosystems 
and the sustainability of their life-supporting goods and services. 

Improving water security and ensuring equitable access to 
water resources remains a challenge. Against a background of 
continuing water degradation and overexploitation, the need 
for sustainable water supplies remains one of humanity’s most 
critical resource needs. There also has been little to no progress 
in most regions in reducing nutrient loads to freshwaters and 
coastal areas, or for governance beyond national jurisdictions.

The complexity of the drivers and associated pressures on aquatic 
ecosystems is a key barrier to attaining internationally agreed 
goals directed at addressing their root causes. Lack of appropriate 
indicators or targets for many environmental, socio-economic 
and governance goals makes assessing progress towards 
achieving water-related goals and sustainable aquatic ecosystems 
especially problematic. Other major barriers include inadequate 
capacity, limited access to technology and funding, information 
and data gaps, and lack of quantifiable targets. More emphasis, 
including enhanced monitoring efforts, should be directed to 
acquiring reliable data on the impacts of climate change and 
extreme weather events on human health and well-being, and 
on environmental integrity. Unfortunately, monitoring of water 
quality, quantity and ecosystem health has been reduced in many 
regions. As a result, there are increasing uncertainties regarding 
assessment and management of the water environment, due both 
to data gaps and to the rapidly changing nature of water issues, 
including those related to climate change.

Finally, analysis of the state and trends regarding the multilateral 
environmental agreements identified in Table 4.1 indicates a 
continuing major need for research, policy development and 
implementation on the national and international level. Data 
collection, including of gender-specific data, also requires greater 
attention, especially regarding the impacts of extreme weather 
events – storms, floods and droughts – on affected people. This 
should form a basis for future policy development, adoption 
and implementation to enhance the security and livelihoods of 
all affected by such events, including women, children and the 
elderly (Bennett et al. 2005). Although this assessment is limited 
by many data and information gaps, sufficient information exists 
to develop useful policy action to address the water and related 
land issues identified in this chapter.

access to improved 
drinking water 
supply

Secure adequate 
and sustainable 
freshwater supply

A/B A: Population without access to improved drinking water 

supply has been reduced from 23% in 1990 to 13% in 2008 and 
is projected to be 9% by 2015 
B: More improvement has been made in urban than rural 
communities, leaving large inequities in access; the reliability 
and quality of water supplies are of concern in many areas

D/B D: Global water withdrawals have tripled over the last 50 years 
to meet increasing demands, with groundwater particularly at 
risk; 80% of people live in areas with high levels of threats to 
water security, including 3.4 billion people in the most severe 
threat category 
B: Construction of dams is improving access to freshwater 
supply in many developing countries

Develop 
programmes for 
mitigating the 
effects of extreme 
water-related events

B/D B: Many governments report major progress towards 
implementation of disaster risk reduction strategies 
D: The number of drought and flood disasters increased by 
38% and 230% respectively from the 1980s to the 2000s, 
while the number of people exposed to floods increased by 
114%

Mitigate and adapt 
to adverse effects 
of climate change 
on the water 
environment 

B/C B: Broad adaptation tools, scenario-based approaches and 

adaptive management are being formulated at multiple scales; 
planned interventions in the water sector can be also be found 
in national adaptation programmes of action (NAPAs) of the 
least developed countries; 35% of World Bank water projects 
during 2006–2008 included mitigation and adaptation 
measures for climate change
C: The costs of adapting to climate change are additional to 
those required to meet current MDG targets on water and 
sanitation, which are themselves underfunded

3. Water use efficiency
Improve the efficient 
B
use of water 
resources

Irrigation efficiency is poor in many regions; irrigation 
technologies have become more efficient but have not been 
widely applied; some efficiency improvements have occurred 
through virtual water trade

Data on monthly environmental flows required 
to maintain ecosystem services at the basin 
level; legal recognition of environmental 
water needs (Part 2); target to define and 
ensure that minimum environmental water 
requirements are met at the basin level; 
incorporation of environmental flows into 
basin allocation schemes

Updated water-related disease and 
hazards data; mechanism for strict 
implementation of MDG at local scales
 

Data on safe (not just improved) drinking 
water access by region; mechanism for 
strict implementation of MDG; agreed 
definition of equitable

Water security metric defined and data 
developed to allow tracking of trends 
over time (groundwater recharge; global 
withdrawals and consumption from the 
energy sector; global overlays of water 
scarcity and demand from energy); 
agreed definition of water security and 
related metrics
Holistic cost-benefit analyses of various 
adaptation and mitigation measures and 
impact analyses of mitigation efforts; policy 
integration, both horizontal (e.g. between 
sectors) and vertical (e.g. from global 
to regional to local); risk management 
strategies for vulnerable communities
Reporting of mitigation and adaptation 
outcomes; monitoring and early warning 
for water-related climate extremes; 
long-term observatories for monitoring 
changes to the hydrologic cycle as a result 
of climate change

Expected to get worse as 
water demands increase

Projected to continue 
improving access to water 
supply and sanitation. 
Africa projected to lag 
behind the rest of the 
world

Population without access 
to improved drinking water 
supply is projected to be 
9% by 2015, meeting the 
related MDG

More people are likely to 
experience more severe 
water stresses in coming 
decades; planetary 
boundaries for freshwater 
use are expected to be 
reached in the coming 
decades
Increased precipitation 
intensity and aridity is 
expected to accentuate 
extreme water-related 
events in many parts of 
the world 

As scientific uncertainty 
is reduced at regional and 
local levels and awareness 
increases, mitigation and 
adaptation measures are 
expected to increase; 
climate change adaptation 
costs for the water sector 
and sea level rise will be 
at least US$35–100 billion 
per year

The rate of implementation 
of water efficiency is not 
on track to keep pace with 
growing demand; virtual 
water trade could help 
efficiently redistribute water

Water resource efficiency trend data by 
sector (including energy sector) and 
country; virtual water trade trend data; 
efficiency impacts of virtual water trade; 
quantitative efficiency targets by sector; 
water allocation efficiency including 
environmental flows

4. Water quality
Reduce and control 
freshwater pollution

128

Part 1: State and Trends

?/C No global datasets of freshwater quality have been available to 
assess overall trends; there have been some local water quality 
improvements but faecal coliforms in at least parts of most 
major river systems exceed WHO standards for drinking; gross 
algal and macrophyte productivity in lakes has increased by 74% 
globally

No outlook data identified

Global and regional data on sediment, 
nutrients, marine litter, toxic chemicals 
and emerging contaminants; rigorous 
global and regional water quality index 
based on comprehensive long-term data; 
water quality standards and targets for 
emerging contaminants

Table 4.3 Progress towards goals (see Table 4.1) continued
4. Water quality continued
Reduce and control 
marine pollution

D/C/B D: At least 415 coastal areas with serious eutrophication. 

Global nutrient run-off increased by approximately 15% since 
1970. 
C: No statistically significant changes in the quantity of coastal 
or marine litter, although data are scarce for many regions
B: Reduction of many contaminants in fish tissue; notable 
recent contamination events include the Fukushima nuclear 
crisis in Japan and the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf 
of Mexico 
The population with access to improved sanitation increased 
from 54% to 61% during 1990–2008, though improvements are 
bypassing the poorest and most rural communities; 2.6 billion 
people (1 in 2.5) were without access to improved sanitation 
in 2008

Nitrogen loads to oceans 
are projected to increase 
from 43.2 million tonnes 
per year in 2000 to 45.5 
million tonnes per year 
in 2030

Not globally on track to 
meet the MDG target of 
halving the proportion of 
people without access to 
improved sanitation

B

Improve sanitation 
coverage, including 
sewage collection, 
treatment and 
disposal

5. Institutional and legal
Recognize the 
economic value of 
water

?

See Chapter 5 for discussion of ecosystem services; Chapters 
10, 11 and 12 give examples of water pricing schemes and 
market-based solutions that reflect the value of water and 
aquatic ecosystems

No outlook data identified

No outlook data identified

Global and regional data on sediment, 
nutrients, marine litter, toxic chemicals 
and emerging contaminants

Water security metric defined and data 
developed to allow tracking of trends 
over time (groundwater recharge; global 
withdrawals and consumption from the 
energy sector; global overlays of water 
scarcity and demand from energy); agreed 
definition of water security and related 
metrics

Data on scope, magnitude and value of 
water-related ecosystem services (e.g. 
value of wetlands as buffers against 
extreme events); goals and targets 
recognizing, protecting and valuing 
ecosystem services for human and 
environmental health and well-being
Capacity to effectively assess and regulate 
environmental impacts beyond national 
jurisdictions

Develop and enforce 
legal frameworks 
and regulations

Strengthen 
institutional 
coordination 
mechanisms

B

B

UNCLOS was ratified by 160 countries and the Global 
Programme of Action (GPA) adopted by 108 countries; legal 
frameworks for industrial and municipal wastewater discharge 
exist in most developed countries although non-point-source 
regulations lag behind; governance of areas beyond national 
boundaries is weak and fragmented; enforcement remains an 
issue in many regions.
Two-thirds of transboundary water-related events are 
cooperative, although the number of water conflicts has 
increased since the 1970s; 295 international water agreements 
have been signed since 1948; less than 20% of the 106 basins 
with water institutions have multilateral agreements in effect; 
143 countries participate in 18 regional seas programmes, 
and the large marine ecosystem approach has delineated 64 
management units globally 

6. Water resources management
Develop and 
implement 
integrated 
management 
strategies and plans 

B/?

There has been an increased recognition of the need for 
integrated approaches for freshwater and marine system 
management; about half of countries have made significant 
progress towards developing and implementing integrated 
approaches to water resources management and water 
efficiency, but the 2002 WSSD target is far from being met; 
implementation is slowed by financial, legal and/or capacity 
barriers; there is insufficient data to evaluate the long-term 
effectiveness of integrated water resource management 

Develop adequate 
monitoring systems 
(national, regional 
and global)

Improve stakeholder 
participation 
and mainstream 
gender in water 
management
Improve 
groundwater 
management

C/D Data are fragmented, lacks complete global coverage or is not 
regularly updated; marine monitoring and remote sensing data 
acquisition has increased, but global freshwater monitoring 
has declined and is now inadequate; modelling and remote 
sensing are complementing monitoring in many instances, but 
still rely on adequate data
No quantitative global data are available to assess this 
goal; stakeholder engagement and gender mainstreaming is 
becoming more common globally, but is still lacking in many 
regions

?

C/D/? C: Arsenic and nitrates threaten aquifers in many countries D: 
Many aquifers are being drawn down at unsustainable rates; 
efficient management requires more data for quantitative 
assessment of the problem
?: Transboundary groundwater systems have been largely 
ignored due largely to insufficient data and lack of agreement

No outlook data identified Metrics of coordination effectiveness

Developing countries 
in particular will face 
difficulties implementing 
integrated management 
approaches due to lack 
of funding, capacity and 
governance

Reporting mechanism and meaningful 
governance indicators for countries’ 
progress towards integrated water 
resources management, including the 
effectiveness of such approaches; 
implementation of policy goals 

Comprehensive monitoring 
systems will continue to be 
limited by financing and 
capacity

Metadata on existing data; agreed 
quantitative targets on comprehensive 
monitoring and reporting systems 

No outlook data available

No outlook data available

Data to assess stakeholder participation, 
including roles of women and men, and 
separating data by sex; institutionalized 
stakeholder participation; systematic 
gender impact assessment
Global level datasets on groundwater 
contamination, availability and 
withdrawal; transboundary management 
of groundwater resources (precluded by 
the data gap)

Main Messages 

The pressure on biodiversity continues to increase. 
Habitat loss and degradation from agriculture 
and infrastructure development, overexploitation, 
pollution and invasive alien species remain the 
predominant threats. Climate change is increasing 
in importance and will have profound impacts, 
particularly in combination with other threats. Greater 
integration of policies and institutional responses, 
including effective engagement of local communities, 
is required to stop and reverse current trends. The 
world lost over 100 million hectares of forest from 
2000 to 2005, and has lost 20 per cent of its seagrass 
and mangrove habitats since 1970 and 1980 
respectively. In some regions, 95 per cent of wetlands 
have been lost. The condition of coral reefs globally 
has declined by 38 per cent since 1980. Two-thirds 
of the world’s largest rivers are now moderately to 
severely fragmented by dams and reservoirs.

The state of global biodiversity is continuing to 
decline, with substantial and ongoing losses of 
populations, species and habitats. For instance, 
vertebrate populations have declined on average 
by 30 per cent since 1970, and up to two-thirds 
of species in some taxa are now threatened with 
extinction. Declines are most rapid in the tropics, 
in freshwater habitats and for marine species 
utilized by humans. Conversion and degradation 
of natural habitats is ongoing, with some having 
experienced declines of 20 per cent since 1980. 
Limited successes, such as saving particular 
species from extinction, reversing the decline of 
some populations, and restoring some habitats, are 
outweighed by continuing declines. 

The benefits humans obtain from biodiversity are at 
risk. Conversion of natural habitats to large-scale, 
commercial agriculture has resulted in net benefits 
for human well-being. However, this has often 
been accompanied by reductions in other services, 

such as carbon sequestration and flood regulation. 
Continuing ecological degradation, unsustainable 
levels of consumption and inequities in sharing 
of the benefits from biodiversity threaten the 
improvements in human well-being and health that 
have been achieved in recent decades. 

There has been an increase in responses to the loss 
and degradation of biodiversity, although these 
have failed to reduce the decline, and more effort 
is needed. Successful responses include: increases 
in the designation of protected areas, now covering 
nearly 13 per cent of land area, and increasing 
recognition of indigenous and local community-
managed areas; and adoption of policies and actions 
for managing invasive alien species and genetically 
modified organisms (GMOs). About 55 per cent of 
countries have legislation to prevent the introduction 
of new alien species and control existing invasives, 
but less than 20 per cent are estimated to have 
comprehensive strategies and management plans, 
and there is a lack of data on their effectiveness. 
Successful responses also include regulations 
that support sustainable harvesting and reduced 
pollution; successful species recoveries and habitat 
restoration; and some progress towards equitable 
access to and benefit sharing of genetic resources. 
International financing for biodiversity conservation 
is estimated to have grown by about 38 per cent in 
real terms since 1992 and now stands at US$3.1 
billion per year. But less than 1.5 per cent of the 
marine area is covered by protected areas. 

An opportunity to develop a concerted global 
approach to stop and reverse the decline of 
biodiversity is provided by the recent adoption of 
the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity (2011–2020) 
including the Aichi Biodiversity Targets, and 
acceptance of the Nagoya Protocol on Access and 
Benefit Sharing.

INTRODUCTION
Biodiversity is formally defined by the Convention on Biological 
Diversity (CBD) as: “the variability among living organisms from 
all sources including, among others, terrestrial, marine and other 
aquatic ecosystems and the ecological complexes of which they 
are part; this includes diversity within species, between species 
and of ecosystems” (UN 1992 Article 2).

In recent years the links between biodiversity and ecosystem 
services and the benefits people derive from these have received 
increasing attention (CBD 2010b; TEEB 2010; Sutherland et 
al. 2009; UNEP 2007; MA 2005a; 2005b). There is growing 
evidence that biodiversity has a vital role in attaining the 
Millennium Development Goals: it contributes to poverty 
reduction and to sustaining human livelihoods and well-being 
through, for example, underpinning food security and human 
health, providing clean air and water, and supporting economic 
development (UNEP 2007; MA 2005a). Given the importance of 
biodiversity and evidence of its ongoing decline (CBD 2010b), it 
is essential to chart progress in reducing and, as far as possible, 
reversing the rate of decline. 

Recent assessments of the status of biodiversity have shown 
little evidence of improvement. The third Global Biodiversity 
Outlook (GBO-3), was launched in May 2010 (CBD 2010b), 
and showed that biodiversity has continued to decline since 
publication of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA 2005a) 
and the last Global Environment Outlook (GEO-4) (UNEP 2007). 
This chapter builds on these recent assessments. The three 
objectives of the CBD, namely, the conservation of biological 
diversity, the sustainable use of its components, and fair and 

equitable sharing of the benefits arising out of the utilization of 
genetic resources, as well as the missions and objectives of other 
biodiversity-related conventions are all considered. 
 
The current chapter presents globally agreed indicators and goals for 
biodiversity, in particular the Aichi Biodiversity Targets (Box 5.1).  
The implications for human well-being of not achieving these 
targets are examined and gaps in achieving internationally 
agreed goals for biodiversity are identified, so as to frame key 
messages for the international community. Current knowledge 
of the pressures, state and trends affecting biodiversity and of 
the benefits of biodiversity to people is synthesized from past 
assessments and recent publications. Management responses 
that address these pressures are also examined so as to chart 
progress in safeguarding biodiversity. In particular, cross-
boundary issues are tackled from both an ecological and an 
equity perspective. The links between biodiversity and traditional 
knowledge and cultural diversity are also considered before 
concluding with a look to the future. 

INTERNATIONALLY AGREED GOALS 
Goals and targets are one aspect of the policy agenda for assessing 
progress in meeting global commitments for biodiversity. Eighteen 
goals related to biodiversity have been identified (Table 5.1 and 
Box 5.2). These range from the Millennium Development Goal 7 
to ensure environmental sustainability, to the most recent five 
strategic goals and 20 Aichi Biodiversity Targets of the Strategic 
Plan for Biodiversity 2011–2020 (Box 5.1). These biodiversity 
goals and targets have been clustered into themes and prioritized 
by taking into account the links between them and by reference to 
key biodiversity issues (Table 5.1 and Box 5.2).

reduction strategies and planning processes and are being 
incorporated into national accounting, as appropriate, and 
reporting systems. 
Target 3: By 2020, at the latest, incentives, including 
subsidies, harmful to biodiversity are eliminated, phased out 
or reformed in order to minimize or avoid negative impacts, 
and positive incentives for the conservation and sustainable 
use of biodiversity are developed and applied, consistent 
and in harmony with the Convention and other relevant 
international obligations, taking into account national socio-
economic conditions. 
Target 4: By 2020, at the latest, governments, business 
and stakeholders at all levels have taken steps to achieve 
or have implemented plans for sustainable production and 
consumption and have kept the impacts of use of natural 
resources well within safe ecological limits. 

Strategic goal B: Reduce the direct pressures on biodiversity 
and promote sustainable use 
Target 5: By 2020, the rate of loss of all natural habitats, 
including forests, is at least halved and where feasible brought 
close to zero, and degradation and fragmentation  
is significantly reduced. 
Target 6: By 2020, all fish and invertebrate stocks and aquatic 
plants are managed and harvested sustainably, legally and 
applying ecosystem-based approaches, so that overfishing 
is avoided, recovery plans and measures are in place for 
all depleted species, fisheries have no significant adverse 
impacts on threatened species and vulnerable ecosystems  
and the impacts of fisheries on stocks, species and 
ecosystems are within safe ecological limits. 
Target 7: By 2020, areas under agriculture, aquaculture and 
forestry are managed sustainably, ensuring conservation of 
biodiversity. 
Target 8: By 2020, pollution, including from excess nutrients, 
has been brought to levels that are not detrimental to 
ecosystem function and biodiversity. 
Target 9: By 2020, invasive alien species and pathways are 
identified and prioritized, priority species are controlled or 
eradicated, and measures are in place to manage pathways  
to prevent their introduction and establishment. 
Target 10: By 2015, the multiple anthropogenic pressures 
on coral reefs, and other vulnerable ecosystems impacted by 
climate change or ocean acidification are minimized, so as to 
maintain their integrity and functioning. 

Strategic goal C: Improve the status of biodiversity by 
safeguarding ecosystems, species and genetic diversity 
Target 11: By 2020, at least 17 per cent of terrestrial and  
inland water areas, and 10 per cent of coastal and marine 
areas, especially areas of particular importance for 
biodiversity and ecosystem services, are conserved through

The Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011–2020 (CBD 2010c), 
including the Aichi Biodiversity Targets (CBD 2010a), was 
adopted by the Parties to the Convention on Biological 
Diversity (CBD) in October 2010, following many regional 
consultations, expert workshops and high-level events 
organized in collaboration with numerous partners. The 
plan contains five strategic goals and establishes targets 
for achieving the vision of “a world living in harmony with 
nature and where, by 2050, biodiversity is valued, conserved, 
restored and wisely used, maintaining ecosystem services, 
sustaining a healthy planet and delivering benefits essential 
for all people” (CBD 2010c Decision X/2).

It is envisaged that the plan will be implemented primarily 
through activities at the national or sub-national level, with 
supporting action at the regional and global levels. Countries 
have committed to developing national and regional targets, 
using the plan and its Aichi Targets as a flexible framework to 
integrate these targets into national biodiversity strategies and 
action plans, and to develop indicators to report on progress in 
2014 and 2018. 

Strategic goal A: Address the underlying causes of 
biodiversity loss by mainstreaming biodiversity across 
government and society 
Target 1: By 2020, at the latest, people are aware of the values 
of biodiversity and the steps they can take to conserve and use 
it sustainably. 
Target 2: By 2020, at the latest, biodiversity values have been 
integrated into national and local development and poverty

effectively and equitably managed, ecologically representative 
and well-connected systems of protected areas and other 
effective area-based conservation measures, and integrated 
into the wider landscapes and seascapes. 
Target 12: By 2020, the extinction of known threatened 
species has been prevented and their conservation status, 
particularly of those most in decline, has been improved 
and sustained. 
Target 13: By 2020, the genetic diversity of cultivated plants 
and farmed and domesticated animals and of wild relatives, 
including other socio-economically as well as culturally 
valuable species, is maintained, and strategies have been 
developed and implemented for minimizing genetic erosion 
and safeguarding their genetic diversity.
 
Strategic goal D: Enhance the benefits to all from biodiversity 
and ecosystem services 
Target 14: By 2020, ecosystems that provide essential 
services, including services related to water, and contribute 
to health, livelihoods and well-being, are restored and 
safeguarded, taking into account the needs of women, 
indigenous and local communities, and the poor and 
vulnerable. 
Target 15: By 2020, ecosystem resilience and the 
contribution of biodiversity to carbon stocks has been 
enhanced, through conservation and restoration, including 
restoration of at least 15 per cent of degraded ecosystems, 
thereby contributing to climate change mitigation and 
adaptation and to combating desertification. 
Target 16: By 2015, the Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic 

Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits 
Arising from their Utilization is in force and operational, 
consistent with national legislation. 

Strategic goal E: Enhance implementation through participatory 
planning, knowledge management and capacity building 
Target 17: By 2015, each Party has developed, adopted as 
a policy instrument, and has commenced implementing an 
effective, participatory and updated national biodiversity 
strategy and action plan. 
Target 18: By 2020, the traditional knowledge, innovations 
and practices of indigenous and local communities relevant 
for the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity, and 
their customary use of biological resources, are respected, 
subject to national legislation and relevant international 
obligations, and fully integrated and reflected in the 
implementation of the Convention with the full and effective 
participation of indigenous and local communities, at all 
relevant levels. 
Target 19: By 2020, knowledge, the science base and 
technologies relating to biodiversity, its values, functioning, 
status and trends, and the consequences of its loss, are 
improved, widely shared and transferred, and applied. 
Target 20: By 2020, at the latest, the mobilization of financial 
resources for effectively implementing the Strategic Plan for 
Biodiversity 2011–2020 from all sources, and in accordance with 
the consolidated and agreed process in the Strategy for Resource 
Mobilization, should increase substantially from the current levels. 
This target will be subject to changes contingent to resource needs 
assessments to be developed and reported by Parties.

Part 1: State and Trends

STATE AND TRENDS 
Biodiversity is affected by multiple drivers and pressures that 
modify its ability to provide ecosystem services to people. 
The interaction of multiple drivers, including demographic, 
economic, socio-political, scientific and technological ones, 
as discussed in Chapter 1, is known to increase pressures on 
biodiversity, leading to further decline, degradation and loss. 
However, the mechanisms associated with such loss require 
further research. 

Pressures 
The principal pressures on biodiversity include habitat loss and 
degradation, overexploitation, alien invasive species, climate 
change and pollution (Figure 5.1) (Baillie et al. 2010; Vié et al. 
2009; MA 2005a). These pressures are continuing to increase 
(Box 5.3) (Butchart et al. 2010; CBD 2010b). 

Habitat loss 
Habitat loss in the terrestrial domain has been caused largely 
by the expansion of agriculture: more than 30 per cent of land 
has been converted for agricultural production (Foley et al. 
2011). Large-scale commercial agriculture has adversely affected 
biodiversity, particularly agro-biodiversity (Belfrage 2006; Rosset 
1999). Moreover, the growing demand for biofuels has taken a 
toll, with expanses of forests and natural lands in South East Asia 
being converted into mono-crop plantations (Danielsen et al. 
2009; Fitzherbert et al. 2008).

Direct habitat loss is a major threat to coastal ecosystems 
through aquaculture (Valiela et al. 2004). Wetlands in

for ecosystem services programmes; and in the number of

Box 5.3 Global Biodiversity Outlook

The Global Biodiversity Outlook is a periodic report prepared 
by the Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity. 
The third edition (GBO-3) was one of the main assessments of 
progress towards the 2010 Biodiversity Target of significantly 
reducing the current rate of biodiversity loss at global, 
regional and national levels, and was an important source 
of information in the development of the Strategic Plan for 
Biodiversity 2011–2020 and the Aichi Biodiversity Targets. 

The main conclusion of GBO-3 was that the 2010 Biodiversity 
Target had not been met. Specifically, the underlying causes of 
biodiversity loss have not been addressed despite increasing 
responses by governments. Pressures on biodiversity have 
remained high or continued to increase, leading to ongoing 
degradation of ecosystems, reductions in species populations 
and increasing extinction risks, as well as erosion of genetic 
variety (Figure 5.2).

Most future scenarios of biodiversity change project continuing 
high levels of population and species extinctions and loss of 

habitats, with associated decline of some ecosystem  
services important to human well-being. There is a high risk 
of degradation of a broad range of such services if ecosystems 
are pushed beyond threshold levels.

While the conclusions of GBO-3 give cause for concern, 
the report also provides a message of hope. Many actions 
in support of biodiversity have been taken, and have had 
significant and measurable results in particular areas and 
amongst targeted species and ecosystems. This suggests that, 
with adequate resources and political will, the tools exist for 
reducing the erosion of biodiversity. Preventing further loss 
in the near term will be extremely challenging, but it can be 
achieved in the longer term if effective action is initiated now 
in support of an agreed long-term vision. Initiating action 
to address the underlying causes of biodiversity decline is 
paramount. Failure to use this opportunity will result in many 
ecosystems moving into new, unprecedented states in which 
the capacity to provide for the needs of present and future 
generations is highly uncertain.

are also threatened (Tockner et al. 2008; Tockner and Stanford 
2002). Benthic habitats have been degraded as a consequence 
of bottom trawling and other destructive fishing methods 
(Thrush and Dayton 2002).

Overexploitation 
Overexploitation of wild species to meet consumer demand 
threatens biodiversity, with unregulated overconsumption 
contributing to declines in terrestrial, marine and freshwater

ecosystems (Figure 5.3) (Peres 2010; Vorosmarty et al. 2010; 
Kura et al. 2004; Dulvy et al. 2003). Although overexploitation is 
often difficult to quantify in terrestrial systems, major exploited 
groups include plants for timber, food and medicine; mammals 
for wild meat and recreational hunting; birds for food and the 
pet trade; and amphibians for traditional medicine and food (Vié 
et al. 2009). The threat to vertebrates from overexploitation is 
particularly severe, driven, in particular, by demand for wildlife 
and wildlife products from East Asia (Figure 5.3). Globally, 
utilized vertebrate populations have declined by 15 per cent 
since 1970 as indicated by the Living Planet Index (Butchart et 
al. 2010). Similarly, the extinction risk of utilized bird species 
increased during 1988–2008, driven in part by overexploitation 
(Butchart et al. 2010). 

In the marine realm, capture fisheries more than quadrupled 
their catch from the early 1950s to the mid-1990s. Since 
then, catches have stabilized or diminished (FAO 2010b), 
despite increased fishing effort (Anticamara et al. 2011; 
Swartz et al. 2010). The proportion of marine fish stocks that 
are overexploited, depleted or recovering from depletion rose 
from 10 per cent in 1974 to 32 per cent in 2008 (Figure 5.4) 
(FAO 2010b; Worm et al. 2009). Of the 133 local, regional 
and global extinctions of marine species documented 
worldwide over the last 200 years, 55 per cent were caused by 
overexploitation, while the remainder were driven by habitat 
loss and other threats (Dulvy et al. 2003). Commercial fisheries 
are the principal threat to fish stocks, but overexploitation

in artisanal fisheries also occurs (Garcia and Rozenberg 
2010). Such practices can ultimately lead to major shifts in 
community composition. For example, coral communities have 
been transformed into algal-dominated systems because of 
overfishing of herbivores (Mumby 2009). 

The use of destructive fishing practices further amplifies the 
impacts of unsustainable fishing on marine biodiversity and 
habitats (FAO and UNEP 2009). Technology can enhance the 
intensity and range of human impacts on marine biodiversity 
although it can also play a significant role in making fishing 
practices less destructive. Moreover, abandoned and lost 
fishing gear is having negative ecological consequences on 
marine biodiversity (also known as ghost fishing) (Brown and 
Macfadyen 2007).

Overfishing is also a problem in freshwater wetlands, although 
in many cases adequate data are not available to quantify the 
extent of the loss (Kura et al. 2004). Recreational fishery practices 
such as stocking and selective take can also have important 
evolutionary impacts on freshwater fish stocks (Jorgensen et al. 
2007). By-catch from fisheries can be a major threat to groups 
such as sharks, turtles and albatrosses.

Invasive alien species 
Invasive alien species threaten native biodiversity and 
are spreading through both deliberate and unintentional 
introductions as a consequence of increasing levels of global 
travel and trade. Poorly planned economic introductions, air 
transport, hull-fouling and ballast water from ships, as well 
as trade in pets, garden plants and aquarium species, are 
significant pathways for the dispersal of invasive species (Reise 
et al. 2006; Bax et al. 2003). Invasive alien species affect native 
species principally through predation, competition and habitat 
modification (McGeoch et al. 2010; Vié et al. 2009; Strayer et al. 
2006). Invasive species have major economic costs, estimated by 
one study to total US$1.4 trillion annually (Pimentel et al. 2004). 
They are found in nearly all countries and habitats, including 
marine ecosystems – for example the red lionfish Pterois volitans 
affects coral reef fish in the Caribbean (González et al. 2009) – 
and freshwater ecosystems: the Nile Perch Lates niloticus, for 
instance, has an impact on native fish in Lake Victoria (Balirwa 
et al. 2003). Invasive species have particularly acute effects 
on the terrestrial biodiversity of small islands (McGeoch et al. 
2010). Data from Europe show that the number of alien species 
has increased by 76 per cent since 1970 (Butchart et al. 2010), 
a pattern that is likely to be similar in other places. In another 
study, invasive alien species were a factor in more than 50 per 
cent of vertebrate extinctions where the cause was known, and 
were the sole cause of 20 per cent of extinctions (Clavero and 
García-Berthou 2005). 

density and distributions of many different types of species are 
driven by climate change (Rosenzweig et al. 2007). For example, 
trends in European bird populations since 1990 show a growing 
impact: populations are increasing among the species projected 
to benefit from climate change while population decline is 
documented for those projected to undergo range contraction 
(Gregory et al. 2009). In the Arctic, tundra habitats are shrinking 
owing to tree-line advance (Callaghan et al. 2005). In the marine 
realm, climate change is causing widespread die-off of coral 
reefs through rising temperatures and ocean acidification (Baker 
et al. 2008; Carpenter et al. 2008; Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 2007). 
The Arctic ice cap is also shrinking rapidly, with likely impacts 
on ice-dependent species (McRae et al. 2010; IPCC 2007), as 
well as shifts in phenology and distribution of marine species 
(Dulvy et al. 2008; Hiddink and Ter Hofstede 2008; Richardson 
2008; Perry et al. 2005). Recent studies have also projected 
distribution shifts of 1 066 marine fish and invertebrate species 
polewards at an average rate of 40 km per decade (Cheung et al. 
2009), leading to likely disruption of community composition 
and local extinctions. 

For many wetlands, changes in rainfall and evaporation are 
expected to have major impacts on water regimes, affecting 
both migratory and residential species (Finlayson et al. 2006), 
while changes in flow in both the short and long term will 
impact many aquatic species (Bates et al. 2008; Xenopoulos 
and Lodge 2006). Climate change will also act synergistically 
with other threats, such as the spread of diseases and invasive 
alien species (Benning et al. 2002). However, in many instances 
it may be difficult to differentiate the effects of these different 
threats, as has been outlined for wetlands and rivers in 
Australia (Finlayson et al. 2011).

Pollution 
Pollutants such as pesticide and fertilizer effluents from 
agriculture and forestry, industry including mining and oil or 
gas extraction, sewage plants, run-off from urban and suburban 
areas, and oil spills, harm biodiversity directly through 
mortality and reduced reproductive success, and also indirectly 
through habitat degradation (MA 2005a). Inland wetlands and 
coastal marine habitats face a major threat from waterborne 
pollutants (Chapter 6) (Finlayson and D’Cruz 2005). Meanwhile, 
atmospheric pollution in terrestrial systems, particularly the 
deposition of eutrophying and acidifying compounds such 
as nitrogen and sulphur (Chapter 2), is also important. Rates 
of nitrogen deposition increased sharply after 1940 but have 
levelled out since 1990, probably owing to an overall decrease 
in biomass burning, though there is regional variation (Butchart 
et al. 2010). Nevertheless, nitrogen deposition continues to be a 
significant threat to biodiversity, especially for species that have 
adapted to low-nitrogen habitats (Dise et al. 2011). 

Climate change 
Climate change is an increasingly important threat to species 
and natural habitats. There is widespread evidence that 
changes in phenology, including the timing of reproduction 
and migration, physiology, behaviour, morphology, population 

Additional threats 
Additional threats to biodiversity include changes in fire regimes, 
problematic native species (Figure 5.1) and negative influences 
from human activities. Influences from human activities that 
may be harmful to biodiversity include artificial illumination, 

Biodiversity 143

Box 5.4 The ecological footprint: an indicator of the pressures on biodiversity

The ecological footprint is a resource accounting tool that 
measures how much biologically productive land and sea 
area – crop and grazing land, forests, fishing grounds and 
built-up land – is demanded by a given population or activity, 
and compares this to how much land and sea is available 
(Kitzes and Wackernagel 2009; Wackernagel et al. 2002; 
Wackernagel and Rees 1996). It has become an increasingly 
popular headline indicator of broad human pressures on 
the environment, although its methodology and application 
continue to be debated (Kitzes et al. 2009; Best et al. 2008; 
Fiala 2008).

Ecological footprint analysis shows that the global demand for 
biologically productive areas has approximately doubled since 
the 1960s (WWF 2010). In 2007, global society demanded 
more than 1.5 planets’ worth of productive biological capacity, 
a deficit that can only be met through the depletion of stocks of 
renewable resources or the accumulation of waste product, most 
importantly carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere (Figure 5.5).  
Together with other indicators (Butchart et al. 2010), this 
trend provides evidence of an overall increase in pressures on 
biodiversity. The continued growth of these pressures is likely 
to increase the difficulty of halting or reversing global loss.

genetically modified organisms (Box 5.5), microplastics, 
nanotechnology, geo-engineering, and high levels of human 
appropriation of net primary productivity (Box 5.4) (Cole 2011; 
Gough 2011; Galgani et al. 2010; Hölker et al. 2010; Sutherland 
et al. 2009, 2008). Scientific understanding of the specific nature 
of threats to biodiversity from these influences is building. 
Meanwhile, the causes of some recent biodiversity declines 
remain unclear, and further research is required to elucidate 
the problems and identify solutions, for example for mammals 
in northern Australia (Woinarski et al. 2011) or trans-Saharan 
migrant birds (Moeller et al. 2008).

Patterns of biodiversity change
Biodiversity is deteriorating at the level of populations, 
species and ecosystems, and genetic diversity is also 
suspected to be declining, although trends remain largely 

unknown (Box 5.3) (Butchart et al. 2010; CBD 2010b; Vié et al. 
2009). Populations of vertebrate species recorded in the Living 
Planet Index have declined on average by 30 per cent since 
1970 (Figure 5.6) (Loh 2010; Collen et al. 2008a). Declines 
in freshwater populations are steeper, at 35 per cent since 
1970, than those for terrestrial populations, which have fallen 
by 25 per cent and marine populations by 24 per cent; those 
in the tropics are steeper than those in temperate latitudes. 
Habitat-specific trends are available for some regions for 
birds and show, for example, that European farmland bird 
populations have declined by 48 per cent on average since 
1980 (Gregory et al. 2005). North American grassland and 
dryland species have declined by 28 per cent and 27 per cent 
respectively since 1968; but North American wetland bird 
species have increased by 40 per cent (Butchart et al. 2010; 
NABCI US Committee 2009).

Part 1: State and Trends

At the species level, the proportion of species threatened with 
extinction – classified as critically endangered, endangered or 
vulnerable on the IUCN Red List – ranges from 13 per cent for 
birds to 63 per cent for cycads, and averaging almost 20 per 
cent for vertebrates (Baillie et al. 2010; Hoffmann et al. 2010). 
Furthermore, Red List Indices for mammals, birds, amphibians 
and corals show that considerably more species have become 
more threatened with extinction over recent decades than 
have become less threatened, and declines have been 
steepest for corals (Figure 5.7) (Butchart et al. 2010; Hoffmann 
et al. 2010). The composition of biological communities is 
increasingly disrupted by human activities, in particular through 
overexploitation. For example, in some oceans the community 
structure appears to have shifted to lower trophic levels owing 
to fisheries targeting predators and larger fish species (Branch et 
al. 2010; Pauly and Watson 2005). This phenomenon of fishing 
down the food web has been reported widely in many parts of 
the ocean, such as in Canada (Pauly et al. 1998), Brazil (Freire 
and Pauly 2010), India (Bhathal and Pauly 2008), Thailand (Pauly 
and Chuenpagdee 2003), the North Sea (Heath 2005) and the 
Caribbean (Wing and Wing 2001). However, the use of catch data 
to indicate fishing down the food web may be confounded by 
data quality and factors such as the spatial expansion of fisheries 
(Swartz et al. 2010), and may need careful interpretation if 
independent data on stock levels are unavailable (Branch et al. 
2011). Other indicators, such as the Fishing-In-Balance (FIB) 
index, may be preferable in future (Kleisner and Pauly 2010; 
Bhathal and Pauly 2008).

At the level of habitats, losses include more than 100 million 
hectares of forest globally during 2000–2005, or 3 per cent of the 
3.2 billion hectares in existence in 2000 (Hansen et al. 2010);

20 per cent of mangroves since 1980; and 20 per cent of 
seagrasses since 1970 (Butchart et al. 2010; Waycott et 
al. 2009). Remaining habitats are increasingly degraded – 
measures of net primary productivity, for example, show that 
around one-quarter of the terrestrial land area is degraded, 
including around 30 per cent of all forests, 20 per cent of 
cultivated zones and 10 per cent of grasslands (Bai et al. 
2008). Similarly, coral reefs have declined globally by 38 per 
cent since 1980 (Butchart et al. 2010; Spalding et al. 2003). 
Natural habitats are also becoming increasingly fragmented 
– 80 per cent of remaining forest fragments in the Brazilian 
Atlantic Forest are now smaller than 50 hectares (Ribeiro et al. 
2009), while two-thirds of the world’s largest rivers are now 
moderately to severely fragmented by dams and reservoirs 
(Nilsson et al. 2005).

CROSS-CUTTING ISSUES
Benefits to people from biodiversity 
Biodiversity underpins the ecosystem services that supply 
benefits to people (UNEP 2007; MA 2005a). The deterioration 
or loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services tends to affect 
poor people most directly as they are the most dependent 
on local ecosystems and often live in places that are most 
vulnerable to ecosystem change (UNEP 2007). Because the 
precise mechanisms of human dependence on biodiversity are 
not fully understood and biodiversity is undervalued – especially 
for regulating services – maintenance of biodiversity is rarely 
fully integrated into policy. Progress has been made since the 
Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (TEEB 2010; MA 2005a), 
which strongly supported the concept of ecosystem services

and their role in providing supporting, provisioning, regulating 
and cultural services (Figure 5.8). More recently, The Economics 
of Ecosystem Services and Biodiversity (TEEB 2010) and green 
economy approaches have quantified the value of biodiversity 
and ecosystem services (UNEP 2011). The Ramsar Convention on 
Wetlands has further outlined the direct links that exist between 
ecosystem services from wetlands and human health (Horwitz 
and Finlayson 2011; Horwitz et al. 2011).

Biodiversity and human well-being
Biodiversity and ecosystem services provide food, medicines, 
fish and timber products as well as biomass, energy and water-
related services that people need for their livelihoods and well-
being. Too often, the use and management of these provisioning 
services has failed to focus on conserving the ecosystems 
providing them. This has resulted in the degradation of regulating 
and supporting services that are important for overall system 
functioning and long-term resilience to change and therefore 

to human well-being, a point that has been well demonstrated 
when considering the effects of expanding agriculture and water 
management (Gordon et al. 2010; Falkenmark et al. 2007). 
Decreases in provisioning services may be a definitive signal that 
a biophysical threshold has already been passed with respect 
to an ecosystem’s ability to provide a service, as in the case of a 
number of fishery collapses (Westley et al. 2011).

Food and medicines produced from terrestrial and aquatic 
ecosystems include wild-harvested products, as well as farmed 
crops, livestock, fish and aquaculture products. Wild-harvested 
foods, such as wild meat, non-timber forest products, wild fruits 
and freshwater resources, remain important for food security, 
health, cultural identity and adaptation for many people (Golden 
et al. 2011; Nasi et al. 2008; Robinson and Bennett 2000). 
Likewise, in some Asian and African countries, up to 80 per 
cent of the population depend on traditional medicines (WHO 
2003). Assessment of the status of birds and mammals used

for these purposes indicates that they are on average facing a 
greater extinction risk than other species (Figures 5.9 and 5.10). 
Although global data for plants are not available, medicinal 
plants face a high risk of extinction in those parts of the world 
where people are most dependent on them. This emphasizes the 
threat posed by biodiversity loss to the health and well-being of 
people directly dependent on the availability of wild species. 

Fisheries provide a major source of food, revenues and 
employment with globally over 80 million tonnes of biomass 
being captured annually from the ocean (Sumaila et al. 2010) and 
large amounts from inland waters (Kura et al. 2004). However, 
as fish stocks are depleted, this supply is becoming increasingly 
dependent on aquaculture, which itself can have many negative 
environmental and social impacts such as pollution, introduction 
of exotic species and displacement of small-scale fishing 
practices (Barnhizer 2001; Naylor et al. 2000; Emerson 1999). 
Recent estimates suggest that in 2000 alone, the potential global 
catch losses due to overfishing amounted to 7–36 per cent of 
the actual tonnage landed that year, resulting in a landed value 
loss of US$6.4–36.0 billion. This amount could have helped 
prevent around 20 million people worldwide suffering from 
undernourishment (Srinivasan et al. 2010).

Agricultural production is also supported by biodiversity and 
ecosystem services (Altieri 1999), and agricultural diversity can 
in turn contribute to food security by supporting adaptation to a 
changing climate (Thrupp 2000). Small-scale livestock husbandry

and pastoralism can both contribute to maintaining biodiversity 
and to sustainable local economies, adaptation to climate 
change, resistance to disease and cultural diversity (FAO 2009). 
Equally, overgrazing can cause soil erosion and desertification, 
thereby decreasing provisioning services. Threats from livestock 
production to biodiversity are likely to grow as demand for 
meat and dairy increases, requiring more livestock feed and 
more water (Thornton 2010). The complex issue of ensuring a 
sustainable food supply for an expanding human population has 
been addressed in recent assessments (IAASTD 2009; Molden 
2007), along with the biodiversity benefits that can be obtained 
by balancing food production with the supply of other ecosystem 
services. Pressures on land, water and biodiversity from 
agriculture and aquaculture could be reduced in some countries 
by reducing overconsumption of food, shifting towards diets 
comprising less meat/fish, and reducing crop losses and food 
waste (Godfray et al. 2010; WHO 2005).

Energy for much of the world’s population is derived from 
biomass. The most commonly used fuels for heating and cooking 
are wood, charcoal and plant and animal waste (Berndes et 
al. 2003). Hydropower depends on high volumes and regular 
rates of flow of water to dams from functioning ecosystems 
in the catchment area, but often contributes to widespread 
negative environmental and social impacts, particularly loss of 
biodiversity and displacement (WHO 2009; Greathouse et al. 
2006; Ligon et al. 1995). The degradation or loss of ecosystem 
services that provide energy is evident in the siltation of 
reservoirs and loss of water volume associated with deteriorating 
catchment areas (Nilsson et al. 2005); in the deforestation 

created by the overharvesting of woody vegetation; and in the 
overuse of agricultural waste and animal manure. The loss 
of ecosystem services associated with overharvesting, poor 
management, climate change and, for example, an increase in 
forest fires, is often felt by already marginalized groups who have 
to collect fuelwood and/or other forms of biomass for household 
energy needs (CBD 2010b). The development of renewable 
energy from marine and coastal environments, such as that from 
offshore wind farms, may result in trade-offs between energy 
production and habitat loss. 

Freshwater from surface and groundwater ecosystems is a critical 
provisioning service used for drinking, sanitation, cooking and 
agriculture (Chapter 4). Wetlands and rivers regulate flows and 
material cycles that play indispensible roles in supporting human 
life systems and benefiting many sectors of society (Arthurton et 
al. 2007; Falkenmark et al. 2007; Finlayson and D’Cruz 2005). 
These ecosystems also provide important regulatory services in 
the form of water purification, erosion control and storm buffering 
(Morris et al. 2003). Meanwhile, groundwater ecosystems provide 
great social and economic benefits through the provision of 
low-cost, high-quality water supplies for both urban and rural 
areas (Bjorklund et al. 2009). Groundwater is also important for 
irrigation, with Siebert et al. (2010) reporting that 40 per cent of 
irrigated areas, some 300 million hectares representing about 
20 per cent of total farmland, are supplied by groundwater.

Cultural and spiritual values from biodiversity are important to 
many communities (Posey 1999). Many have benefited from 
exploiting the recreational and cultural value of biodiversity 

148

Part 1: State and Trends

forests are more biologically diverse, and also more carbon 
dense, than other forest ecosystems. Modified natural forests 
and plantations have less biodiversity and lower carbon stocks 
than primary forests under similar environmental conditions 
(CBD 2009a). Efforts to maintain forest health, for example 
through incentive mechanisms such as Reducing Emissions 
from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD+), have the 
potential to help mitigate climate change. These can also have 
multiple benefits for biodiversity if interventions ensure that 
environmental and social safeguards are respected, such as full 
and effective participation of indigenous and local communities 
(Cotula and Mathieu 2008), and if they avoid displacing 
deforestation and degradation from areas of lower conservation 
value to those of higher biodiversity value, or exerting pressures 
on other native ecosystems.

Many of the options available to help society adapt to the 
effects of climate change depend on and are enhanced by 
biodiversity. Ecosystem-based adaptation uses the range of 
opportunities for the sustainable management, conservation 
and restoration of ecosystems to provide services that enable 
people to adapt to the impacts of climate change. For example, 
intact, well-functioning ecosystems, with natural levels of species 
diversity, are usually more able to continue to provide ecosystem 
services, and resist and recover more readily from extreme 

for ecotourism (Ehrlich and Ehrlich 1992). For example, lakes, 
wetlands, rivers and coastal ecosystems offer significant 
ecotourism potential with, for example, coral reef tourism in 
Belize estimated to be worth US$150–196 million per year 
(Cooper et al. 2009). These aquatic ecosystems also supply water 
that is integral to many social, spiritual and religious activities. 
Examples include the sacred status of water sources and riparian 
zones for the Bantu-speaking peoples of Southern Africa (Bernard 
2003) and the duty of care exercised by Maori in New Zealand for 
the life force exhibited by water (Williams 2006).

The wildlife and timber trade, comprising the sale or exchange 
of wild animal and plant resources, is prevalent within national 
borders. However, significant volumes can also be traded 
internationally, for example highly prized products such as caviar 
and medicines. The primary motivating factor for wildlife traders 
is financial, ranging from small-scale local income generation 
to major profit-oriented business, such as marine fisheries and 
logging companies. In some cases, harvest and trade of species 
can provide a significant proportion of local or national income. 
Overall, the legal trade in wildlife including live animals, animal 
products for clothing and food, ornamental and medicinal 
plants, fish and timber was estimated at over US$300 billion in 
2009 (TRAFFIC in prep.; Roe 2008). Furthermore, illegal trade is 
believed to be substantial, possibly worth US$10 billion (Haken 
2011). Timber and seafood are the most important categories of 
international wildlife trade in terms of both volume and value: 
around 90 million tonnes of fish were captured in 2008 with trade 
valued at more than US$100 billion (FAO 2010b), while the trade 
in primary wood products in 2009 was valued at US$189 billion 
(FAO 2010a).

Biodiversity and climate change
Biodiversity plays an important role both in supporting efforts to 
mitigate climate change and in enabling societal adaptation to its 
effects. Ecosystems store and sequester carbon through biological 
and biophysical processes that are underpinned by biodiversity. 
About 2 500 gigatonnes (billion tonnes) of carbon are stored in 
terrestrial ecosystems, compared to approximately 750 gigatonnes 
in the atmosphere (Chapter 3) (Ravindranath and Oswald 2008). 
Almost 38 000 gigatonnes are stored in the oceans, of which about 
37 000 gigatonnes are in deep ocean layers that will only feed 
back to atmospheric processes over very long time scales (Sabine 
et al. 2004). Around 1 150 gigatonnes are stored in forests, with 
30–40 per cent in biomass and 60–70 per cent in soil. Significant 
carbon stocks are also found in other terrestrial ecosystems 
including wetlands and peatlands. Indeed, the latter cover only 
3 per cent of the land area, but reputedly contain nearly 30 per cent 
of all global soil carbon (Parish et al. 2008). Marine ecosystems 
on average take up an additional 2.2 gigatonnes of carbon per 
year (Le Quéré et al. 2009; Canadell et al. 2007). The critical role 
of freshwaters in the global carbon cycle has only recently been 
demonstrated (Battin et al. 2009; Cole et al. 2007).

The importance of forests in storing almost half of all terrestrial 
carbon, and sequestering carbon from the atmosphere, means 
that they play a major role in climate change mitigation. Primary

weather events than degraded, impoverished ones (CBD 2009a). 
Healthy ecosystems also play an important role in protecting 
infrastructure and enhancing human security, and therefore in 
reducing the risk from disasters (ISDR 2009). Ecosystem-based 
adaptation options are often more accessible to the rural poor 
than interventions based on infrastructure and engineering, and 
there can be multiple social, economic and environmental co-
benefits for local communities from its use when designed and 
managed appropriately. 

Responses to the threats to biodiversity
Managing agriculture and biodiversity 
Successful management of agricultural landscapes requires 
a reduction of habitat loss and degradation whilst providing 
an adequate supply of food for a growing human population. 
Sustainable agriculture has received increasing attention 
because expanding agriculture is globally the principal driver 
of biodiversity decline (Brussaard et al. 2010; IAASTD 2009; 
MA 2005b). In recent years attention has been given to a 
new paradigm of ecoagriculture or integrated conservation-
agriculture, which seeks to integrate biodiversity conservation 
with rural development. This paradigm is being explicitly 
considered in shaping conservation strategies with clearly 
identified economic and ecological relationships that include 
ecosystem services (IAASTD 2009; Scherr and McNeely 2008). 
The extensification of agriculture may require more land than 

intensive agriculture to achieve the same production levels 
(Godfray et al. 2010; Phalan et al. 2011), but it may be more 
sustainable in the long term and have fewer impacts on wildlife 
and human health (Perfecto and Vandermeer 2010). New 
approaches that combine the most effective, least harmful 
practices from intensive and extensive farming, sometimes 
termed sustainable intensification, will be needed (Royal Society 
2009). In this context the use of GMOs in agriculture and also in 
aquaculture potentially presents both threats and opportunities 
for biodiversity (Box 5.5).

Managing invasive species
Successful management of invasive species relies on preventing 
the introduction and spread of species to new areas, as well 
as controlling and eradicating established invaders. Ten 
different international agreements and organizations have 
some relevance, including the International Plant Protection 
Convention, the World Trade Organization, the International 
Maritime Organization, the Convention on International Civil 
Aviation and the Convention on Biological Diversity. Since 1970 
there has been a significant increase in the number of parties to 
these agreements (Figure 5.11), with 81 per cent of the world’s 
countries acceding to them (McGeoch et al. 2010). Although this 
signifies an international intent to manage biological invasions, 
no international agreement currently deals exclusively with the 
trade, transport or control of alien and invasive species (Stoett 

Box 5.5 Genetic modification 

Genetic modification (GM) remains controversial, both 
a potential threat and an opportunity for biodiversity 
conservation, depending on the context. The technology is 
widely used in pharmaceuticals and crop production, but 
many consider it an unwarranted risk to the environment and 
human health. A genetically modified organism (GMO) is 
defined by the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety as any living 
organism that possesses a novel combination of genetic 
material obtained through the use of modern biotechnology 
(CBD 2000); generally by the transfer of genetic material from 
one species to another. The vast proportion of GM crops has 
been modified to be tolerant of broad-spectrum herbicides 
to allow more efficient weed control and/or to express a toxin 
(Bt) that acts against the caterpillars of butterflies and moths 
that live and feed inside the crop plants. 

Genetically modified crops were first planted commercially 
in 1996, and by 2010 they covered 148 million hectares. 
Although the largest areas were in the United States, Canada, 
Brazil, China and Argentina, the greatest number of adopters 
– 14.4 million out of an estimated total of 15.4 million – were 
small farmers in developing countries (James 2010).

Genetic modification technologies are being developed to 
control malaria, both by making wild mosquito populations 

less capable of carrying the malaria parasite (malERA 2011; 
Sinkins and Gould 2006) and by reducing mosquito numbers 
through introducing sterility, replacing the use of radiation 
(Bax and Thresher 2009).

Several environmental risks from GMOs have been identified, 
including the loss of genetic diversity of agricultural species 
and their wild relatives through gene flow, although this 
also occurs with non-GM crops (Piñeyro-Nelson et al. 2009). 
Another concern is the effects on organisms that are not 
the target of the GM trait, although Bt crops have few toxic 
effects on non-target species as the Bt toxins produced are 
highly specific and only expressed in the plant itself. Further, 
the effects tend to be outweighed by overall increases in 
invertebrate numbers because of lower levels of pesticide use 
(Marvier et al. 2007). Lower pesticide use also has benefits for 
human health in some areas (Raybould and Quemada 2010). 
In contrast, GM crops tolerant of broad-spectrum herbicides 
such as glyphosate often result in fewer weeds than 
conventional crops, and therefore make less food available 
to farmland birds (Gibbons et al. 2006). In addition, species 
are evolving resistance to both glyphosate and Bt (Powles 
2010; Liu et al. 2010). These latter outcomes are examples 
that raise concern over the complexities of the environmental 
implications of GMOs.

2010). At a national level, only 55 per cent of countries have 
legislation to prevent the introduction of new ones and to control 
existing ones, and less than 20 per cent are estimated to have 
comprehensive strategies and management plans. In many 
cases, information on existing management activities either does 
not exist or is not readily available (Stoett 2010). 

To control threats from invasive alien species, the following 
actions are seen as necessary:
•	 integrated	planning	to	prevent	further	introductions	by	

managing priority pathways;

•	 focus	on	controlling	established	species	and	priority	invaders	

with significant impacts on biodiversity (Hulme 2009); and
•	 investment	in	the	knowledge	generation,	data	collation	and	
research needed for risk assessments (McGeoch et al. 2010). 

Managing wildlife trade and use
Wildlife use and trade can be managed through a variety of 
measures, including regulatory measures such as policies and 
laws and voluntary ones such as certification schemes; formal 
measures such as positive and economic incentives, and informal 
ones such as influencing sustainable consumer behaviour; direct 
measures such as customs inspections and other enforcement 
actions, and indirect ones such as economic influences. These 
measures can be applied at a variety of levels from the local, such 
as delineating resource extraction zones in protected areas or 
establishing community-based natural resource management, to 
the global, such as through the Convention on International Trade 
in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) (Roe 2008).

Managing the impacts of climate change on biodiversity 
through mitigation and adaptation 
Managing the impacts of climate change will be important, as 
recent studies show that the range shifts of terrestrial organisms 
towards the poles and higher altitudes as a result of climate 
change may be significantly faster than previously thought 
(Tewksbury et al. 2011). Minimizing the adverse impacts of 
climate change on biodiversity is dependent on: 
•	 efforts	to	mitigate	climate	change	itself	(Chapter	3);
•	 measures	to	ensure	that	those	activities	and	societal	

adaptation efforts do not themselves have adverse impacts 
on biodiversity; and 

•	 application	of	best	practice	in	conserving	and	restoring	

biodiversity in the face of climatic change. 

Of the wide range of approaches, many are dependent on the 
conservation and sustainable use of healthy ecosystems, and 
offer opportunities for synergies in terms of climate change 
mitigation and maintenance of biodiversity. In particular, this 
concerns intact forests and wetlands, but also natural and 
semi-natural grasslands and many agricultural ecosystems. For 
example, some agricultural approaches, such as conservation 
tillage and agroforestry, can result in the maintenance and 
enhancement of terrestrial carbon stocks and also contribute 
to the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity (CBD 
2009a). Traditional knowledge and systems of small-scale 
livestock husbandry, farming, and forest product collection 
can greatly enable local mitigation and adaptation in culturally 
appropriate ways (RECOFTC 2010; IUCN 2008). However, 
ecosystem-based approaches also carry risks and these need

of intact and functioning ecosystems supported by restoration 
initiatives wherever possible (CBD 2009a). 

Managing area-based conservation 
Protected areas are seen by many as the core means of preventing 
ongoing losses of species and habitats. Protected areas have 
expanded over the past 20 years in both number and area (Figures 
5.12 and 5.13) and now cover 13 per cent of the world’s land 
area (IUCN and UNEP-WCMC 2011). However, coverage is uneven, 
and 6 of the 14 global biomes and half of the 821 terrestrial 
ecoregions do not meet the CBD target for 10 per cent of their area 
to be protected by 2010 (Jenkins and Joppa 2009). Furthermore, 
the expansion of the world’s protected area network needs to be 
targeted at the most important sites for biodiversity. Some 51 per 
cent of the 587 sites identified by the Alliance for Zero Extinction 
as critical for the survival of hundreds of highly threatened 
species, and 49 per cent of the more than 10 000 important 
bird areas are still entirely outside the protected area network 
(Butchart et al. 2012). Even more importantly, the performance of 
protected areas in maintaining populations of their key species is 
poorly documented. Although some studies have found wildlife 
declines within some protected areas (Woinarski et al. 2011; 
Craigie et al. 2010), others demonstrate that protected areas have 
been effective in maintaining species that would otherwise have 
disappeared (Bruner et al. 2001). However, not all species may 
require protected areas to ensure their survival (Pereira and Daly 
2006), and protected areas require complementary broad-scale 
conservation measures (Boyd et al. 2008).

Uneven protected area coverage of biomes is most evident in 
the marine realm, despite a CBD target to protect 10 per cent 
of the ocean by 2012. By the end of 2010 marine protected

to be assessed and addressed. In the case of forests, the 
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 
(UNFCCC 1992) and CBD have recognized a need for safeguards, 
particularly for biodiversity and human communities, to minimize 
risks associated with REDD+. There is also a risk of conflict 
between the goals of the Kyoto Protocol’s Clean Development 
Mechanism for carbon sequestration and biodiversity 
conservation (Heiskanen 2009; Kneteman and Green 2009).

Other concerns about the impacts of mitigation activities 
include those related to artificial ocean fertilization through 
using nutrients such as iron or nitrogen to increase the uptake 
and sequestration of atmospheric carbon. The effectiveness 
of this approach is highly uncertain and increasingly thought 
to be quite limited. Potential negative environmental effects 
include increased production of methane and nitrous oxide and 
changes in phytoplankton community composition, which may 
lead to toxic algal blooms (CBD 2009b). Alternative sources of 
energy production, such as biofuels, hydropower, wind farms 
and oceanic tide generators have all been documented to have 
impacts on biodiversity if safeguards are not developed (Keder 
and McIntyre Galt 2009; McDonald et al. 2009). The most 
fundamental strategy for conserving biodiversity in the face of 
climate change will continue to be promoting the conservation

areas covered 1.6 per cent of the ocean area (IUCN and UNEP-
WCMC 2011). Indeed, at the end of 2010, only 12 countries had 
designated more than 10 per cent of their waters, often through 
large areas, while 121 countries had yet to designate more than 
0.5 per cent of their marine jurisdiction (Toropova et al. 2010). In 
response, the CBD has retained the 10 per cent target, with  
a revised achievement date of 2020. 

Marine protected areas can be designated at a variety of levels 
of protection, but those with complete protection provide the 
greatest biodiversity benefits. A review of 112 independent 
studies in 80 different protected areas found significantly higher 
fish populations inside the reserves than in surrounding areas 
or in the same place before protection was established. Relative 
to reference sites, population densities were 91 per cent higher, 
biomass 192 per cent higher and average organism size and 
diversity 20–30 per cent higher, usually between one and three 
years after establishment of a reserve. These trends occurred 
even in small marine protected areas (Halpern 2003).

Protected areas can also play a key role in climate change 
mitigation and adaptation, preventing the conversion of natural 
habitats to other land uses and hence avoiding significant 
release of carbon (Dudley et al. 2010b). Emissions from land-
use change, mainly forest loss, contribute up to 17 per cent of all 
anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions (IPCC 2007). It has been 
estimated that about 15 per cent of the global terrestrial carbon 
stock is stored in the world’s protected area network (Campbell 
et al. 2008), and the role that this can play in climate mitigation 

is underlined by the fact that between 2000 and 2005, protected 
areas in humid tropical forests lost about half as much carbon as 
the same area of unprotected forest (Scharlemann et al. 2010).

Indigenous and community-conserved areas
Protected areas can be effectively managed by many groups, 
from government agencies to local communities and indigenous 
peoples, and from non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to 
private individuals. Recently, the full range of IUCN protected 
area categories has been brought into use for designating 
protected areas (Dudley et al. 2010a). For example, in Australia, 
protected areas established and managed by indigenous 
communities comprise nearly a quarter of Australia’s national 
reserve system by area. Indigenous and community-conserved 
areas (ICCAs) and sacred natural sites (SNSs) have proven 
successful in conserving a rich biological and biocultural 
diversity by supporting the maintenance of traditional 
environmental knowledge and practices (Porter-Bolland et al. 
2012; Sobrevila 2008). These community areas are extremely 
diverse, manifesting myriad ethical, economic, cultural, 
spiritual and political dimensions (Brown and Kothari 2011; 
Borrini-Feyerabend et al. 2010a, 2010b; Kothari 2006; Posey 
1999). They include waterfowl nesting wetlands, roosting 
sites or other critical wild animal habitats, and landscapes 
with mosaics of natural and agricultural ecosystems such as 
the Potato Park in the Andean Highlands of Peru and the rice 
terraces of the Philippines. A number of studies demonstrate 
the wide range of values they provide (Box 5.6) (Mallarach et al. 
2012; Verschuuren et al. 2010; ICCA 2009).

The number and extent of ICCAs and SNSs have not been 
comprehensively estimated. It has been, nevertheless, 
suggested that in some parts of the world their area is similar 
to that currently under government-managed protection (Box 
5.6) (Molnar et al. 2004). Furthermore, it has been estimated 
that communities own or manage 22 per cent of all forests 
in 18 developing countries (White and Martin 2002). Recent 
analyses highlight the potential effectiveness of indigenous and 
community-managed areas in tropical forest conservation. For 
example, such areas can be more effective in reducing tropical 
deforestation than forest protected areas (Porter-Bolland et al. 
2012), and indigenous and multiple-use protected areas can 
reduce the incidence of tropical forest fires as effectively as strict 
protection (Nelson and Chomitz 2011).

ICCAs and SNSs are increasingly recognized as legitimate and 
powerful tools for the security of both their custodians and 
the biodiversity they encompass, supported by a range of 
conservation, human-rights and development instruments. 
A preliminary survey of the laws and policies of 27 countries 
and one sub-national region showed that progress in national 
recognition of ICCAs and SNSs is patchy: some countries are 
moving rapidly, others slowly, and some not at all (Kothari et al. 
2010). The biggest challenge, now that ICCAs and SNSs have 
global attention, is in gaining appropriate national recognition 
and support, particularly for tenure, customary practices and 
decision-making institutions, and other fundamental human 
rights (Stevens 2010). Activities relating to governance, 
participation, equity and benefit sharing in relation to protected 
areas merit increasing consideration.

Recognizing the value of cultural diversity and traditional 
knowledge
The recognition of human and natural systems as unified social-
ecological systems is increasingly important for safeguarding 
biodiversity (Ostrom 2007). This growing understanding 
underscores the links between biological and cultural diversity 
and the role of local and indigenous peoples in the sustainable 
governance and management of biodiversity (Sutherland 
2003; Moore et al. 2002). The Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 
and the Aichi Biodiversity Targets support greater respect of 
traditional knowledge and its full integration and reflection in 
CBD implementation at all levels, with the full and effective 
participation of indigenous and local communities (Aichi Target 
18, Box 5.1). Information on the status and trends of linguistic 
diversity (Figure 5.14) has been used as a proxy indicator for 
traditional knowledge, innovations and practices, including those 
about biodiversity. Traditional knowledge is an invaluable and 
irreplaceable source of information about biodiversity and human 
relationships; its loss entails a loss of collective cultural heritage 
and capacity to adapt to and live sustainably within specific 
ecosystems and areas (Maffi and Woodley 2010; Swiderska 2009). 

Access and benefit sharing of genetic resources and 
associated traditional knowledge
The fair and equitable sharing of the benefits of exploiting genetic 
resources is one of the three CBD objectives (Article 1), recognized 
as critical for biodiversity conservation. Through the recently 
adopted Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the 
Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilization, 
standards are established for regulating access to genetic resources 

Box 5.6 Examples of community management

Globally: 
Community-controlled or managed forests total some  
400–800 million hectares (Molnar et al. 2004; White et al. 2004). 

Africa:
Forty-seven of the approximately 70 Kaya forests, totalling 
about 6 000 hectares, have been legally recognized in Kenya 
and are being cared for in collaboration with local communities 
(Githitho 2003). In the Republic of Tanzania, a total area in 
excess of 2 million hectares is under community-based forest 
management (Blomley and Iddi 2009).

Europe: 
In a small country like Estonia, there are estimated to be more 
than 7 000 sacred natural sites, although less than 500 are 
legally protected (Valk and Kaasik 2007). 

Americas: 
A fifth of the Amazon is classed as indigenous territory helping 
to achieve biodiversity conservation (Oviedo 2006), and 
more than 800 000 hectares of boreal forest and wetlands 

have been declared protected traditional territory in Canada 
(Government of Manitoba 2011). 

Asia: 
Several thousand natural ecosystem sites, ranging from a 
hectare to several hundred square kilometres, are under 
community conservation in South Asia (Kalpavriksh 2011; 
Jana and Paudel 2010; Pathak 2009). At least 13 720 sacred 
groves have been reported in India and experts estimate 
the total number for the country at 100 000–150 000 
(Malhotra et al. 2001). Across South East Asia and Japan, 
there are hundreds of community-managed marine areas 
oriented towards sustainable fisheries and coastal/marine 
ecosystem conservation (Yagi et al. 2010; Ferrari 2006; 
Lavides et al. 2006).

Oceania: 
Forty indigenous protected areas cover more than 23 
million hectares (DSEWPC 2011), and there are hundreds of 
community-conserved areas and locally managed marine areas 
in the South Pacific (Govan et al. 2009).

recognizes that states have a sovereign right to exploit their own

Non-threatened

Access to genetic resources has emerged as a major political 
rallying point in international negotiations. Much of the world’s 
biodiversity is concentrated in the forests of developing 
countries in the tropics, but much of the technology and 
financial capital that can convert elements of biodiversity into 
commercial products rests with the developed countries. Hence, 
while unprecedented biodiversity loss is a global concern, 
commercial use and the associated issues of intellectual property 
fundamentally alter the nature of biodiversity as a global public 
good (Giraud 2008; Gupta 2006; Schuler 2004). The impetus 
behind the Nagoya Protocol arose from growing discontent 
amongst developing countries and indigenous and local 
communities regarding the lack of implementation of the benefit-
sharing provisions of CBD since it came into force in 1993. This 
was compounded by only a handful of user countries undertaking 
any compliance measures to prevent bio-piracy despite the 
adoption of guidelines in 2002.

The Nagoya Protocol is an important milestone for rectifying the 
issues of equity associated with the commercial use of genetic 
resources and associated traditional knowledge. The protocol is 
also unprecedented in its recognition of the right of indigenous 
and local communities to regulate access to traditional 
knowledge associated with genetic resources in accordance 
with their customary laws and procedures. The protocol opened 
for signature in February 2011 and will not enter into force until 
90 days after 50 countries have signed. A number of countries

already have national legislation and regulations pertaining to 
issues of access and benefit sharing, and monitoring the further 
development of such regulations could provide a useful indicator 
of progress (Figure 5.15). 

In the marine realm, ten countries own 90 per cent of the patents 
deposited with marine genes – with 70 per cent belonging to 
just three – but account for only about 20 per cent of the world’s 
coastline. These nations benefit from access to the advanced 
technologies required to explore the vast genetic reservoir of the 
oceans, leading to a call for policies targeting capacity building to 
improve access for other countries (Arnaud-Haond et al. 2011).

PROGRESS, GAPS AND OUTLOOK
Assessment of progress and gaps
Conservation strategies
Protected areas are one of the primary responses for maintaining 
biodiversity, particularly on land, but are generally deemed to 
be insufficient (Rodrigues et al. 2004). The exclusion of local 
communities from many state and private protected areas along 
with the failure to fully acknowledge their role in safeguarding 
biodiversity remains a challenge to real progress. Outside 
protected areas the proportion of sustainably managed production 
landscapes – for agriculture, forestry, fisheries and aquaculture, 
amongst others – is increasing, but only slowly. For example, the 
area of forest certified by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) 
as sustainably managed continues to grow, reaching 149 million 
hectares in 2012 (FSC 2012), and there are additional areas 
managed under the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest 
Certification (PEFC), but this remains a small fraction of the global 

total of managed forests. Similarly, fish products certified by the 
Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) constituted only 7 per cent of 
global fisheries in 2007 (Jacquet et al. 2009). 
 
National biodiversity strategies and action plans
The CBD requires all member states to develop a national 
biodiversity strategy and action plan as the primary mechanism 
for the implementation of its strategic plan. To date, 172 of the 
193 signatory countries have adopted their plans or equivalent 
instruments (CBD 2011). The large number of plans is an 
achievement in itself, and more so where they have stimulated 
conservation action at the national level and contributed to a 
better understanding of biodiversity, its value and management. 
In spite of these achievements, national strategies have not been 
fully effective in addressing the main drivers of biodiversity loss. 
Only a few countries have used the plans as mechanisms for 
mainstreaming biodiversity and ecosystem services, and there is 
generally poor coordination with other relevant policies (Prip et 
al. 2010; CBD 2010c). However, Parties to the CBD are expected 
by 2014 to revise their plans in line with the new Strategic 
Plan for Biodiversity 2011–2020, which includes reference to 
improving mainstreaming.

Resource mobilization
Many national reports submitted to the CBD have identified the 
lack of financial, human and technical resources as the most 
widespread obstacle to implementation of national strategies 
and the CBD in general. Thus, the fulfilment of the Aichi Target 
to substantially increase resource mobilization will be crucial to 
enable the other targets to be achieved.

156

Part 1: State and Trends

While documentation is lacking for both the current and the 
required level of financing to safeguard biodiversity, there is no 
doubt that the gap between the two is substantial. Estimates 
suggest that existing financing is in the order of tens of billions 
of dollars a year, while total needs are of the order of hundreds 
of billions a year (Rands et al. 2010; Berry 2007; James et al. 
2001). International financing for biodiversity is estimated to 
have grown by approximately 38 per cent in real terms since 
1992 and now stands at US$3.1 billion annually (OECD 2010; 
Gutman and Davidson 2008). The Global Environmental Facility 
(GEF) will provide US$1.2 billion for CBD implementation from 
2010 to 2014, an increase of 29 per cent compared to the 
previous four years.

Increasingly, innovative financial mechanisms are considered 
essential tools to mobilize additional resources for biodiversity. 
These include payment for ecosystem services, biodiversity 
offsets, ecological fiscal reforms, markets for green products 
and biodiversity in new sources of international development 
finance. For example, further information on schemes such as 
Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD+) 
is available in Chapter 3.

Knowledge gaps for biodiversity monitoring
Although indicators of the state of biodiversity are predominantly 
showing declines (Butchart et al. 2010; CBD 2010b), there are 
considerable gaps in their geographic, taxonomic and temporal 
coverage (Pereira et al. 2010a, 2010b; Walpole et al. 2010; 
Collen et al. 2008a, 2008b). While biodiversity loss is a global 
phenomenon, its impact may be greatest in the tropics where 
available indicators and data coverage are the least complete. 

Particular gaps in knowledge for state indicators include: 
grassland and wetland extent, habitat condition, primary 
productivity, genetic diversity of wild species, freshwater 
and terrestrial trophic integrity, ecosystem functioning and 
ocean acidification. Pressure indicators lack data on pollution, 
exploitation in terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems, wildlife 
disease incidence and freshwater extraction. The principal gaps 
in response indicators include sustainable management of 
agriculture and freshwater fisheries, and management of invasive 
alien species. 

A prominent gap in knowledge concerns ecosystem services 
(UNEP-WCMC 2011; TEEB 2010). Indicators of the biodiversity that 
underpins these services should be tailored to the scales at which 
ecological processes that produce the services occur, such as the 
landscape scale for agriculture and biomass production, and the 
watershed for direct water use and hydroelectricity generation. 

Other responses to biodiversity loss include policy action 
to tackle an array of issues including hunting and pollution, 
and enforcement of environmental impact assessments and 
mitigation measures for infrastructure development; however, 
global trend data are unavailable for these. Given that most 
global biodiversity targets, such as the Aichi Targets, require 
action at the national scale, national biodiversity data are crucial

species including lemurs – is using payment-for-ecosystem-services 
schemes to attract new funding for the protection of biodiversity and 
ecosystems. © Tdhster/iStock

for tracking progress towards global biodiversity targets, and 
to inform national strategies. National Red Lists of threatened 
species are one of the many examples of nationally relevant 
biodiversity data that may provide suitable input for reporting 
on progress towards these goals and for informing national 
conservation priority setting (Zamin et al. 2010), although there 
are others which are also suitable (Jones et al. 2011). The Group 
on Earth Observations Biodiversity Observation Network (GEO 
BON) is expected to make an important contribution to future 
monitoring efforts (GEO BON 2011), whilst the Biodiversity 
Indicators Partnership (BIP 2011) is supporting global and 
national biodiversity indicator development for the Aichi Targets 
and for national biodiversity strategies and action plans. 

Projections, scenarios and horizon scans
While recognizing a time frame of increasing uncertainty, 
this section synthesizes biodiversity studies from short-term 
projections through to longer-term scenarios with a view 
to distilling relatively short-term policy implications. This 
relies heavily on the GBO-3 analysis of biodiversity scenarios 
(Leadley et al. 2010; Pereira et al. 2010a), for which scientists 
from a wide range of disciplines came together to seek 
consensus on projections and scenarios for biodiversity change 
during the 21st century. 

Although quantitative projections and scenario methods are well 
advanced, the range of projected changes reported by the studies 

Biodiversity 157

reviewed is rather broad, partially because there are significant 
opportunities to intervene through better policies, but also 
because of large uncertainties in the projections. The projections 
of global change impacts on biodiversity show continuing and, 
in many cases, accelerating species extinctions (Figure 5.16), 
loss of natural habitat, and changes in the distribution and 
abundance of species and biomes over the 21st century. Possible 
thresholds, amplifying feedbacks and time-lag effects leading to 
tipping points appear to be widespread and make the impacts of 
global change on biodiversity hard to predict, difficult to control 
once they begin, and slow and expensive to reverse once they 
have occurred. For many important cases, the degradation of 
ecosystem services goes hand-in-hand with species extinctions, 
declining species abundance or widespread shifts in species and 
biome distributions; however, the conservation of biodiversity 
and of some services, especially provisioning services, is often 
at odds. Strong action at international, national and local levels 
to mitigate the drivers of biodiversity change and to develop 
adaptive management strategies could significantly reduce or 
reverse undesirable and dangerous biodiversity transformations 
if urgently, comprehensively and appropriately applied.

•	 land	must	be	used	more	efficiently	to	decrease	the	rate	of	

habitat loss;

•	 mitigation	of	climate	change	is	urgent	and	there	is	a	

significant risk of tipping points near or even before the 2°C 
mean global surface temperature target agreed at the UNFCCC 
meeting in Cancun in 2010;

•	 payments	for	ecosystem	services	and	the	greening	of	national	

accounts can help to protect biodiversity if appropriately 
applied; 

•	 protected	areas	by	themselves	have	not	been	adequate	to	

achieve the target of reducing the rate of biodiversity loss by 
2010; 

•	 potential	collapse	of	oceanic	ecosystems	requires	an	
integrated and ecosystem-based approach to ocean 
governance; and 

•	 recognizing	the	importance	of	local	participation	and	

community support, it is crucial to ensure that policies are 
integrated, sensitive and inclusive of local communities. 
This applies to conservation strategies, preservation of local 
cultures and languages, and access and benefit sharing of 
genetic resources and traditional knowledge.

Policy implications 
The accumulated evidence, cited above, suggests that there is 
greater success in halting the negative changes in biodiversity 
and ecosystem services when a proactive attitude in support 
of a sustainable environment is adopted. Overall, the above 
synthesis, coupled with inputs from UNEP’s Foresight Initiative 
(Peduzzi et al. 2011), suggests that: 

Outlook summary
A summary of progress in achieving the main biodiversity goals 
is provided in Table 5.2. It also outlines gaps in data and policy 
and is based on expert opinion. The International Platform on 
Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) is expected to 
play an important role at the science-policy interface in future 
(Perrings et al. 2011).

to be declining
Declining at the global scale, 
most rapidly in the tropics, 
freshwater habitats and for 
utilized marine species; there are 
some exceptions due to effective 
conservation action, for example 
North American waterbirds
13–63 % of species in different 
groups are threatened with 
extinction; trends, where known, are 
declining (most rapidly for corals)

Declines in all natural habitats

Terrestrial coverage has reached 
nearly 13%, but marine coverage is 
less than 1.5%; representativeness 
at the scale of ecoregions is fairly 
high, but the proportion of fully 
protected key biodiversity sites 
is low

Community-based governance and 
management approaches exist 
largely without state recognition 
or are newly developing; external 
drivers of biodiversity loss and/
or other factors undermine the 
capacity of ICCAs, SNSs, and other 
such areas to conserve biodiversity
The development of REDD+ and 
PES schemes is increasing

Area certified as sustainably 
managed increasing, but the 
proportional area remains 
minimal, with an uneven global 
distribution 
Proportion of countries with 
relevant legislation increasing, but 
implementation and transboundary 
cooperation are poor
Numerous local examples show 
that successful conservation 
programmes prevent extinctions, 
restore habitats and conserve 
sites; however, the scale of these 
efforts remains inadequate
Agreement of Nagoya Protocol 
on access and benefit sharing is 
a significant step forward, with 
increasing numbers of signatories 
and countries with relevant 
legislation
Number of languages and speakers 
is declining, suggesting less 
traditional knowledge in support of 
sustainable use and conservation

Protected area extent is likely 
to increase if governments 
fulfil their commitments; more 
careful site selection and better 
management will be required to 
protect biodiversity; jurisdictional 
uncertainties and conflicts need 
resolution
Likely to increase in importance; 
empowerment of local communities 
in decision making is needed, 
plus greater awareness amongst 
government protected-area officials

Data on trends in the effectiveness of protected 
areas and on jurisdictional uncertainties and 
conflict 

Data on the location, extent, legal status and 
effectiveness of these areas for biodiversity 
conservation; possible forms and modes of 
appropriate state recognition and support

The area under REDD+ and PES 
schemes is likely to increase, 
providing both opportunities and 
potential threats for biodiversity 
conservation

Potential indicators such as number and area of 
community-managed REDD+ areas or number of 
national adaptation strategies with ecosystem-
based components

Area of certified production 
increasing, especially in developed 
countries

Effectiveness for biodiversity conservation; 
impacts of these approaches in non-certified 
areas

Policy responses increasing but 
ineffective without considerably 
improved implementation

More data needed on implementation and 
effectiveness

Improvements in coordination and 
integration are expected, but on 
their own will remain insufficient

More data on species recovery and restoration 
needed

Implementation of the Nagoya 
Protocol could address this issue 
effectively

Data required on access and benefit-sharing 
agreements and beneficiaries, and on the 
benefits and sustainability of utilizing genetic 
resources 

Appropriate mechanisms, including 
support for customary sustainable 
use of biodiversity and secure 
tenure, may help to halt the decline 
in traditional knowledge 

Indicators to capture intergenerational transfer 
of traditional knowledge and provision of 
incentives; indicators on the retention of 
traditional knowledge to assess social-
ecological resilience

Main Messages 

There is an extensive but incomplete body of scientific 
knowledge on the impacts of chemicals and wastes on 
humans and the environment, with particular information 
and data gaps on the uses, emissions, exposure pathways 
and effects of chemicals. Global understanding of the 
complexity of properties and environmental impact of 
chemicals and wastes is therefore markedly deficient. The 
fourth Global Environment Outlook (2007) indicated that 
data were incomplete globally and that, for many regions, 
it was important to evaluate the magnitude of chemical 
contamination and its impacts on the environment and 
human health. But little has occurred since then. The 
UN Secretary-General, in his May 2011 report on policy 
options for waste management to the Commission on 
Sustainable Development, stated that: “the barriers to 
effective management and minimization include lack of 
data, information, and knowledge on waste scenarios”. 
And the UN-Habitat report on waste management in cities 
stated that “waste reduction is desirable but, typically, it is 
not monitored anywhere” (UN-Habitat 2010).

Over the last decade chemical production has shifted 
from the countries of the Organization for Economic Co-
operation and Development (OECD) to the BRIC countries 
(Brazil, Russia, India and China) and other developing 
countries, accompanied by a doubling of sales and the 
development of many new types of chemical. The OECD’s 
share of world production is now 9 per cent less than in 
1970. Much of this shift has been due to major emerging 
economies. In 2004, China accounted for the largest 
share of BRIC production at 48 per cent, followed by 
Brazil and India at 20 per cent each, and Russia at 12 per 
cent (OECD 2008b). Chemical consumption in developing 
countries is likewise growing much faster than in the 

developed world and could account for a third of global 
consumption by 2020.

Chemicals play an important role in human life, economic 
development and prosperity, yet they can also have 
adverse impacts on the environment and human health. 
The diversity and potential consequences of such 
impacts, combined with limited capacity in developing 
countries and economies in transition to manage these 
impacts, make the sound management of chemicals 
and waste a key cross-cutting issue. A recent study by 
the World Health Organization (WHO) (Prüss-Ustün et al. 
2011) indicated that 4.9 million deaths were attributable 
to environmental exposure to chemicals in 2004. In 
many regions, hazardous waste streams are mixed with 
municipal or solid wastes and then either dumped or 
burned in the open air (UN-Habitat 2010).

Global chemical pollution is a serious threat to 
sustainable development and livelihoods. The problem 
has impacts on both humanity and ecosystems, and 
includes adverse effects from long-term exposure to low 
or sub-lethal concentrations of single chemicals or to 
mixtures of chemicals. Currently, more than 90 per cent 
of water and fish samples from aquatic environments 
are contaminated by pesticides. Estimates indicate that 
about 3 per cent of exposed agricultural workers suffer 
from an episode of acute pesticide poisoning every year 
(Thunduyil et al. 2008). Pollution with persistent organic 
pollutants (POPs) is widespread, in particular affecting 
remote areas such as the Arctic and Antarctic.

Emerging issues requiring better understanding 
and prompt action to prevent harm to health and

the environment include the sound management of 
electronic and electrical waste (e-waste), endocrine-
disrupting chemicals, plastics in the environment, 
open burning, and the manufacture and use of 
nanomaterials. E-waste has become one of the major 
environmental challenges of the 21st century: it is the 
fastest-growing waste stream in the world, estimated at 
20–50 million tonnes per year (Schwarzer et al. 2005). 
It is of particular interest because it contains not only 
hazardous substances – such as heavy metals including 
mercury and lead, and endocrine-disrupting substances 
such as brominated flame retardants (BFRs) – but also 
many strategic metals such as gold, palladium and 
rare earth metals that can be recovered and recycled. 
Very little is known about whether nanomaterials or 
nanoparticles are released from products when they 
are incinerated, buried or degraded over time, so it is 
possible that they will pose a serious waste disposal 
challenge. Sound decision making on nanotechnology 
has provoked much debate among developed country 
regulators, and increasingly among the regulators of 
developing countries (Morris et al. 2010).

Effective management of these issues requires better 
information gathering and integrated approaches 
to chemicals, radioactive materials and waste 
management, supported where appropriate by 
improved environmental governance. The process for 
greater cooperation and coordination between the 
chemicals and waste conventions (Basel, Rotterdam 
and Stockholm) provides an opportunity to enhance 
awareness raising, knowledge transfer, capacity 
building and national implementation that should be 
further explored.

Chemicals and Waste   169
Chemicals and Waste 169

INTRODUCTION
More than 248 000 chemical products are commercially available 
(CAS 2011) and subject to regulatory and inventory systems. 
Chemicals provide valuable benefits to humanity including in 
agriculture, medicine, industrial manufacturing, energy extraction 
and generation, and public health and disease vector control. 
Chemicals play an important role in achieving developmental and 
social goals, especially for improving maternal health, reducing 
child mortality and ensuring food security, and advances in 
their production and management have increased their safe 
application. Nonetheless, because of their intrinsic hazardous 
properties, some pose risks to the environment and human 
health. Simultaneous exposure to many chemicals – the cocktail 
or synergistic effect – is likely to exacerbate the impacts. 

Chemicals are released at many steps in their life cycle, from the 
extraction of raw materials, through production chains, transport 
and consumption, to final waste disposal. They are distributed 
through indoor environments, food and drinking water, and 
through soils, rivers and lakes. Certain long-lived chemicals such 
as persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and heavy metals are 
transported globally, reaching otherwise pristine environments 
such as rain forests, deep oceans or polar regions, and can 
quickly pass along the food chain, bioaccumulating to cause 
toxic effects in humans and wildlife. 

Products derived from chemicals often become hazardous 
wastes in their end-of-life phase, generating additional 
pollution risks that can devalue their initial benefits and 
counteract development advantages. Pollution from dumping 
and uncontrolled open burning is common (UN-Habitat 2010), 
and is even increasing in some parts of the world, though 
some progress has been made in recent decades. The causes 
of mismanagement often lie in such factors as deficiencies in 
institutional and regulatory frameworks. Such shortcomings 
also have an impact on the growing transboundary movement 
of hazardous wastes from developed to developing countries, 
where compliance, monitoring and enforcement of regulations 
tend to be weak, and the financial and technical capacity to 
implement improved waste management practices is limited. This 
leads to a risk of rapidly increasing exposure for greater portions 
of the population and to related, often serious, health problems, 
in particular for women and children.

Broadly, a two-speed situation exists, with developed countries 
generally having comprehensive systems for chemical and 
hazardous waste management, while developing countries 
generally do not. Developing countries and economies in 
transition struggle with basic landfill co-disposal of many types 
of wastes, with little capacity for their separation and sound 
management. 

While many developing countries have ratified the multilateral 
environmental agreements on chemicals and wastes – such as 
the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movement 
of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal (Basel Convention 1989) 
– these are not always transposed into national legislation in 

170

Part 1: State and Trends

a comprehensive manner. In addition, given the cross-sectoral 
nature of the issue, the regulation and management of chemicals 
in most developing countries is spread over several ministries – 
including agriculture, industry, labour, environment and health 
– and between several agencies within each ministry. 

In most countries, it is the poorest members of the population 
that are at particular risk of exposure. This may be due to 
occupational exposure, poor living conditions, lack of access to 
clean water and food, domestic proximity to polluting activities, 
or a lack of knowledge about the detrimental impacts of 
chemicals – or a combination of these factors.

Radioactive contamination is another source of potential 
environmental and health hazards, both from controlled 
emissions and waste management, and from accidental release. 
The controlled release of radionuclides to the atmospheric 
and aquatic environments may occur as authorized effluent 
discharge, while uncontrolled release may occur as a result of 
accidents and at legacy sites left by nuclear weapons testing. The 
management and disposal of radioactive waste from industry, 
research and medicine, as well as from nuclear power, is relevant 
to almost all countries, requiring different approaches according 
to the volume, radioactivity and other properties of the waste.

Initially, governance instruments for chemicals and wastes 
could be considered to have been reactive, piecemeal and 
isolated, and with mixed success – the Montreal Protocol on

Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer (UNEP 1987), for 
example, being effective in reducing the impact of ozone-
depleting substances, while the Basel Convention (1989) 
has struggled to reduce the transboundary movement of 
hazardous waste. There have been significant advances over 
the past decade, however, and regulatory instruments are now 
improving with the better and more widespread understanding 
of the life cycle of chemicals and their association with the 
generation and processing of wastes. Efforts to bring the work 
of the Basel, Rotterdam and Stockholm Conventions together 
constitute a first step towards addressing the entire life cycle 
of chemicals. This also applies to the establishment of the 
Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management 
(SAICM) and the current negotiation for an international 
agreement on mercury. Similarly, the Joint Convention on the 
Safety of Radioactive Waste Management and the Safety of 
Spent Nuclear Fuel Management is a significant step forward. 
However, ensuring that these efforts are sustained and fully 
anchored at the national level requires further investment in 
better science-based understanding of chemicals and wastes, 
policy creativity to balance development and sustainability 
imperatives, public-private partnerships to link technological 
innovation and societal responsibility, and allocation of funds 
for comprehensive capacity building.

INTERNATIONALLY AGREED GOALS
This chapter evaluates progress towards internationally agreed 
goals relevant to chemicals and wastes. The goals are those 
identified by the GEO-5 High-Level Intergovernmental Advisory 
Panel from key multilateral environmental agreements and 
related agreements and declarations, as further considered and 
prioritized in regional consultations. The current lack of data, a key 
constraint on many aspects of chemical and waste management, 
has not been seen as a reason to preclude the selection of a goal. 
The goals evaluated are reflected in Table 6.1. 

In the 1970s and 1980s the human health and environmental 
impacts of chemicals and waste led to the creation of a number 
of key international agreements. These, along with other 
related goal-based international agreements and declarations 
such as those emanating from the 2002 World Summit on 
Sustainable Development (WSSD) in Johannesburg, constitute 
a framework for organizing and implementing specific goals for 
the environmentally sound design, production, consumption and 
recycling or disposal of chemicals and hazardous waste (Box 6.1). 
These goals are also considered against the background of the 
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), specifically MDG 1 for 
eradicating extreme poverty and hunger, and MDG 7 for ensuring 
environmental sustainability. MDG 7 includes specific targets for 
ozone-depleting substances, as well as for improved access to 
safe drinking water and sanitation facilities. 

The broad set of principles pivotal to the development of 
international agreements comprises prior informed consent for 
the transboundary movement of hazardous waste and certain 
hazardous chemicals; transparency through national reporting; 
the environmentally sound management of chemicals and waste; 

Box 6.1 Multilateral environmental agreements and 
the sound management of chemicals

The sound management of chemicals is addressed by 
17 different multilateral agreements including the 1998 
Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent 
Procedure for Certain Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides 
in International Trade and the 2001 Stockholm Convention 
on Persistent Organic Pollutants (both effective since 2004). 
In addition, in 2006 the First International Conference 
on Chemicals Management established the Strategic 
Approach to International Chemicals Management (SAICM), 
a multi-stakeholder policy framework for achieving the 
safe management of chemicals worldwide by 2020 (SAICM 
2009). So far, more than 300 activities have been conducted 
under the SAICM Global Plan of Action. Pollutant release 
and transfer registers have been promoted and currently 
just 23 countries have established a functioning national 
register. The globally harmonized system of classification 
and labelling of chemicals, containing all criteria necessary 
for classification of chemicals according to their intrinsic 
hazardous properties, has been established, as have 
provisions for hazard communication. However, many 
challenges remain and the lack of prioritization of sound 
management of chemicals, the limitations of legislation, 
the lack of information and the lack of adequate financial 
resources, including for the funding of activities concerning 
the remediation of contaminated sites, are still major 
obstacles to achieving the 2020 goal (CSD 2010).

waste prevention; the precautionary approach; and the polluter-
pays principle. These are addressed through specific obligations 
such as the implementation of control measures, monitoring 
of the state of the environment, and compliance regimes with 
supportive delivery mechanisms including capacity building and 
training, international cooperation, synergies and partnerships.

Goals relevant to the sound management of chemicals and 
waste aim to protect human health and the environment while 
improving resource efficiency. They can be grouped into six 
themes: 
•	 sound	management	of	chemicals	throughout	their	life	cycle,	

including persistent organic pollutants and heavy metals, and 
of waste;

•	 control	of	the	transboundary	movement	of	hazardous	wastes	

as well as responsible trade in hazardous chemicals;
•	 transparent	science-based	risk	assessment	and	risk	

management procedures, as well as monitoring systems at 
the national, regional and global levels;

•	 support	for	countries	to	strengthen	their	capacity	for	the	

sound management of chemicals and waste;

•	 protection	and	preservation	of	the	marine	environment	from	

all sources of pollution;

•	 safe	radioactive	and	nuclear	waste	management.

The objective of this programme area is to ensure that radioactive wastes are safely managed, transported, 
stored and disposed of, with a view to protecting human health and the environment, within a wider framework 
of an interactive and integrated approach to radioactive waste management and safety.

Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel 
Management and on the Safety of Radioactive 
Waste Management (IAEA 1997) Article 1

The objectives of this Convention are: (i) to achieve and maintain a high level of safety worldwide in spent 
fuel and radioactive waste management [...]; (ii) to ensure that during all stages of spent fuel and radioactive 
waste management there are effective defenses against potential hazards so that individuals, society and 
the environment are protected from harmful effects of ionizing radiation, now and in the future, in such a way 
that the needs and aspirations of the present generation are met without compromising the ability of future 
generations to meet their needs and aspirations; (iii) to prevent accidents with radiological consequences 
and to mitigate their consequences should they occur during any stage of spent fuel or radioactive waste 
management.

STATE AND TRENDS
The fourth Global Environment Outlook (2007) indicated that 
data were incomplete at the global level, making it a challenge 
for many regions to evaluate the magnitude of chemical 
contamination and its impacts on the environment and human 
health. Little has changed in five years and a worldwide effort is 
needed to fill this gap. The forthcoming UNEP Global Chemicals 

Outlook report should assist: it aims to provide a framework for 
assessing and setting priorities to stimulate further international 
action on sound management of chemicals. 

Chemicals and wastes: data and indicators
The lack of data on existing chemicals, and the rapid 
technological changes that bring new chemicals to the 

172

Part 1: State and Trends

market, have hindered the production of an established set of 
indicators with time-series data that can be used to identify 
the state and trends of chemicals and wastes. Several possible 
indicators to fill this gap are proposed below. In addition, 
extensive investment in collating the required data and 
solidifying the knowledge base is required to construct long-
term time series. 

Underlying data on waste generation, treatment and recycling 
are difficult to obtain. Some are available on hazardous 
waste through reports to the Secretariat of the Basel 
Convention (Figure 6.1), providing information on the quantity, 
characteristics, destination and mode of treatment or disposal 
of hazardous waste that is subject to international movement, 
but even this is incomplete and unverified – as was reported in 
2011 to the tenth Conference of the Parties to the Convention 
(UNEP 2011a). Global data on non-hazardous waste generation 
and disposal have not been systematically reported and are 
therefore unsatisfactory. As stated by the UN Secretary-General 
in his May 2011 report to the Commission on Sustainable 
Development: “The barriers to effective management and 
minimization include lack of data, information, and knowledge 
on waste scenarios, lack of comprehensive regulations and 
weak enforcement of existing legislation, weak technical 
and organizational capacities, poor public awareness and 
cooperation, and lack of funds.” (UNCSD 2011)

There is an urgent need to improve the availability and 
quality of these basic datasets, with a focus on comparability 
between countries, timeliness and coherence over time, and 
interpretability. As waste is increasingly seen as a potential 
resource, waste data and indicators should be more closely 
linked to economic and social information systems and material

Chemicals and Waste 173

Three indicators to help inform governments and municipalities 
of industry performance and progress are highlighted here. It is 
imperative that data for these indicators are generated to guide 
decision making on sound global management of wastes. The  
key indicators proposed are:
•	 quantity	and	types	of	waste	–	solid,	organic,	hazardous	and	

non-hazardous – managed or finally disposed of;

•	 waste	and	hazardous	waste	generation	per	person;	and
•	 the	amount	of	municipal	or	household	waste,	industrial	solid	

waste and hazardous waste that is recycled.

Status and trends of the chemical industry
The chemical industry is a major driver of economic growth and 
its performance is a leading indicator of economic development. 
In 2008 the global chemicals industry had an estimated turnover 
of about US$3.7 trillion (OECD 2010a) and was growing at 3.5 per 
cent per year. More than 20 million people around the globe are 
employed by it directly or indirectly, and it is an intensive energy 
consumer and a ubiquitous generator of emissions. 

While companies in the countries of the Organisation for 
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) continue 
to account for the bulk of world production (74.5 per cent in 
2004), the OECD’s share is now 9 per cent less than in 1970. 
Much of this shift has been caused by the major emerging 
economies, particularly the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, 
India and China). In 2004, China accounted for most BRIC 
production (48 per cent), followed by Brazil and India (20 per 
cent each), and Russia (12 per cent) (OECD 2008b). Chemical 
consumption in developing countries is likewise growing much 
faster than in developed countries, and could account for a 
third of global consumption by 2020. At the same time, some

data show that developed countries are reducing chemical 
use. For example, overall use of pesticides in OECD countries 
declined by 5 per cent during 1990–2002, although trends 
vary from country to country (OECD 2008a). Total releases and 
transfers of the 152 pesticides that are common to the United 
States and Canada dropped by 18 per cent and the production 
of ozone-depleting substances almost stopped; emissions of 
acid rain precursors dropped by 48 per cent, ozone precursors 
by 38 per cent and non-methane volatile organic compounds by 
26 per cent. Nonetheless, international cooperation between 
all governments is needed to build capacity, share information 
and promote effective chemicals management globally (OECD 
2008b). Figure 6.2 shows the sales data of the world’s major 
chemical-producing countries.

Waste as an issue of global significance 
The growing interdependence of the global economy along with 
the increasing generation and complexity of waste worldwide 
can lead countries to unsound waste management and disposal 
operations, and there may come a point when related costs 
are such that the economy and public services fail to keep 
up. Integrated policies are required to support sustainable 
economic development through recycling, recovery, reuse and 
other operations aimed at reducing both the use of natural 
resources and the quantities of waste, as it is inevitable that 
some resource inputs to industrial production are returned to 
the environment as waste, and may be hazardous. A critical 
issue is to reverse current trends in waste generation, which 
would require a high level of commitment to minimize both 
quantities and levels of hazard. Furthermore, unsound recycling 
comes with the risk of pollution and increased human exposure 
to toxic substances. Recycling can also be misused as a disguise 
for criminal operations.

The introduction of many new chemical substances to the  
market leads to the production of new kinds of wastes. In many 
regions, hazardous waste streams are mixed with municipal 
or solid wastes and then either dumped or burned in the open 
(UN-Habitat 2010). This raises issues of environmental and social 
justice, as the people most affected by such precarious practices 
are usually the poor who live and work adjacent to dump sites. 

Through globalization, materials may be produced in one 
country or region, used in another and managed as waste in 
a third. Electrical and electronic equipment provides a case 
in point (Schluepa et al. 2009; Cui and Forssberg 2003). The 
treatment of end-of-life electronics, including toxic substances 
and plastics with associated flame-retardants as well as 
precious metals, exemplifies the two sides of this business. The 
original equipment has the potential to contribute to protecting 
human health, supporting livelihoods and creating jobs, while 
also promoting a shift from waste to resources that supports 
economic development, energy efficiency and the conservation 
of natural resources. However, unsound or inadequate waste 
management can have profound human health impacts and 
cause serious harm to the environment. Extending the useful life 
of electrical and electronic equipment and using less harmful 
substances in these products is one way to reduce the waste 
burden and its accompanying hazards. 

Municipal waste
The unsound management of waste can lead to mutually 
reinforcing undesirable effects. It can pollute and contaminate 
the environment, pose a threat to human health and represent 
a loss of resources in the form of both materials and energy. 
The recent UN-Habitat report on solid waste management in 
cities refers to the escalating challenge of managing it across 
the globe, and amply demonstrates the complexity and variety 
of issues faced, including the difficulty of achieving objectives 
when progress goes unrecorded, stating for example that 
“waste reduction is desirable but, typically, it is not monitored 
anywhere” (UN-Habitat 2010).

Box 6.3 Waste in the OECD 

The quantity of municipal waste generated in OECD countries 
has risen steeply since 1980, exceeding an estimated 650 
million tonnes in 2007 (556 kg per person). In most countries 
for which data are available, increased affluence associated 
with economic growth and changes in consumption patterns 
tend to generate higher levels of waste per person. Over the 
past 20 years, however, waste generation has risen less rapidly 
than either GDP or expenditure on private consumption, with 
a slow-down in recent years. The amount and composition of 
municipal waste going to final disposal depend on national 
waste management practices. Despite improvements in these 
practices, only a few countries have succeeded in reducing the 
quantity of solid waste for disposal (OECD 2010b).

Municipal waste constitutes a significant percentage of the total 
waste a country generates (OECD 2008b), with annual figures 
ranging from 0.4 to 0.8 tonnes per person, and solid waste 
generation increasing at an estimated rate of about 0.5–0.7 per cent 
per year. Waste complexity is also increasing with the  co-disposal 
of assorted waste types: biodegradable components currently 
account for almost 50 per cent of municipal solid waste and 
electronic waste (e-waste) for 5–15 per cent. The management of 
waste is further complicated by the range and diversity of waste 
generators, from mining and a wide variety of manufacturers 
through agricultural and medical waste to household rubbish. In 
addition, the sound management of municipal waste constitutes 
a sizable and continuous part of a municipality’s budget. 

Many countries do not have the infrastructure to deal with ever 
more complex waste streams. Nor do many have the regulatory 
and physical infrastructure to derive some rebate from the 
recyclable materials that are inevitably part of municipal waste.

Life-cycle thinking: identifying the range of impacts 
from chemicals and wastes
What ultimately determines how humans and ecosystems 
are exposed to toxic chemicals is defined by their life-cycle 
characteristics. Releases of substances not only occur during 
chemical production but also during the use of products 
containing chemicals (Figure 6.3), and finally at their disposal. 
Life-cycle thinking promotes an integrated approach to the 
sustainable production and consumption of such substances. 

The entire life cycle of resource use, from extraction and 
production/manufacture through consumption/use to post-
consumption disposal, produces undesirable environmental 
impacts from emissions and wastes. These impacts can include 
unintended side effects such as endocrine disruption, which 
directly interferes with growth and development in most animals, 
and can also affect people (WHO 2002). Life-cycle analysis 
helps understand such impacts, but, while a useful tool, it can 
be extremely complex. Too often, when problems are identified, 
shifts to alternative chemicals that have the same intended 
properties may result in further unexpected or undesirable 
outcomes (Muir and Howard 2010). 

The latest materials to raise concern are those arising from 
synthetic biology and engineered nanomaterials. With the 
accelerated pace at which new technologies and chemicals are 
being deployed (Poliakoff et al. 2002), a different approach 

is needed in which their implications are systematically and 
comprehensively assessed before they reach production. The use 
of green chemistry principles in chemical design and the adoption 
of clean production processes may help to prevent problems at 
a later stage. While this is happening in some parts of the world 
through the use of exposure models – for example by the Canadian 
Centre for Environmental Modelling and Chemistry (CEMC 2012) 
– for some technologies and chemicals, life-cycle analysis has yet 
to become a universal systematic approach. This may well require 
new forms of international governance (Finnveden et al. 2009). 

The high number and diversity of chemicals and the complexity of 
their life cycles inevitably lead to a situation where the scientific 
understanding of the impacts of chemicals, and the regulatory 
schemes used to manage them, lag behind technological and 
economic developments. 

Poverty and exposure to chemicals: vulnerable groups
The overwhelming majority of impacts from unsafe chemical 
use and unsound waste disposal – including death, impairment 
of health and ecosystem degradation – occur in situations 
of poverty (Sexton et al. 2011). Increased risks of exposure 
to toxic and hazardous chemicals and wastes predominantly 
affect the poor, who routinely face such risks because of their 
occupation, poor living standards and lack of knowledge 
about the detrimental impacts of exposure to these chemicals 
and wastes. Many of the poor enter the informal sector of the

attributable to environmental exposure to chemicals in 2004. 
Indoor smoke from the use of solid fuels, outdoor air pollution and 
second-hand smoke are among the most critical causes. The study 
concluded that the known burden of chemicals, while considerable, 
is an underestimate because data on many chemicals are scarce.

Changes in the global production, trade and use of chemicals 
and the concomitant production of hazardous wastes are not 
always accompanied by corresponding control measures, 
thus increasing the risk of releasing hazardous chemicals 
into the environment. It is estimated that there are 2 million 
contaminated sites in Europe, the United States and the Russian 
Federation alone. Data for developing countries and economies 
in transition are more difficult to obtain, but indications are 
worrying. The Global Inventory Project – which involves the 
Blacksmith Institute together with the United Nations Industrial 
Development Organization (UNIDO), the Green Cross and the 
European Commission – is currently assessing the state of 
contaminated areas in 80 countries worldwide, with trace metal 
and pesticide pollution among the ten most problematic types of 
contamination (Blacksmith Institute 2011). This is the first such 
attempt to give governments, international organizations and 
affected communities aggregated data for decision making.

economy where they may encounter new kinds of toxic hazards 
such as electronic and electrical waste (e-waste). Risk is not only 
related to the dose they receive from such exposure, but also to 
important factors such as age, nutritional status and co-exposure 
to other chemicals. Children are particularly susceptible to the 
negative health impacts of chemicals due to their rapid growth 
and development and greater exposure relative to body weight 
(Sheffield and Landrigan 2011).

A recent study by the World Health Organization (WHO) (Prüss-
Ustün et al. 2011) indicated that 4.9 million deaths were

Box 6.4 Waste generated on board ship

The world fleet comprises more than 80 000 vessels of 
which around 50 000 merchant ships carry out 90 per cent 
of international trade. Every ship generates waste during its 
operation or when transporting cargo, including sludge, oily 
tank washings known as slops, rubbish from the crew, and 
cargo residues. Depending on its size, a ship can generate 
a few hundred tonnes of slops during a voyage. With 50 000 
ships of more than 500GT (gross tonnage) in the world fleet, 
and assuming an average of ten port calls per ship, half a 
million port calls take place annually (Mikelis 2010). Port 
states are required by the International Convention for the 
Prevention of Pollution from Ships 1973, as modified by its 
1978 Protocol (MARPOL 73/78), to provide adequate port 
reception facilities to collect waste generated on board ships. 
Illicit discharges of slops represent a major source of marine 
pollution. For instance, according to the Regional Marine 
Pollution Emergency Response Centre for the Mediterranean 
Sea (REMPEC), there are more than 2 500 illicit discharges 
of ship waste in the Mediterranean Sea annually. The 1972 
London Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by 
Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter, along with its 1996 
Protocol, is one of the first global conventions to protect the 
marine environment from the effects of human activities and 
has been in force since 1975. Its objective is to promote the 
effective control of all sources of marine pollution and to 
take all practicable steps to prevent pollution of the sea by 
dumping of wastes and other matter. 

some 80 per cent of the pollution coming from land-based 
sources (UNEP 2011b). Common man-made pollutants include 
pesticides, chemical fertilizers, heavy metals, detergents, 
oil, sewage, plastics and other solids (UNEP 2011b). Many of 
these pollutants accumulate in the deep oceans and sediments 
(Jacobsen et al. 2010; Zarfl and Matthies 2010; Wania and Daly 
2002), where they are consumed by small marine organisms 
and may be reintroduced to the global food chain. Some 20 per 
cent of marine pollution originates from direct disposal into the 
oceans: regular discharges of oily wastes from ships, accidental 
oil spills and untreated sewage disposal in enclosed areas such 
as the Mediterranean are threats to marine ecosystems (UNEP 
2011b). Figure 6.4 shows the occurrence of PCB in beached 
plastics around the globe. Some of the most harmful pollutants 
also come from diffuse sources such as air pollution.

Persistent organic pollutants
Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are a group of chemicals 
with common features including persistence, bioaccumulation 
and long-range transport. Combined with their toxicity, these 
characteristics have significant adverse effects both on wildlife, 
including marine mammals, and on human populations, 
in particular such vulnerable groups as nursing mothers 
and infants. The health effects of exposure to POPs include 

neuro-developmental disorders, endocrine disruption and 
carcinogenicity (Diamanti-Kandarakis et al. 2009).

The Stockholm Convention on POPs was adopted in 2001 in 
response to an urgent need for global action, and entered 
into force in 2004. It currently has 177 Parties and calls for 
documentation of the amounts of POPs that are still present in 
different countries and for global monitoring of these substances 
in human tissue (blood and milk). This is one of two indicators 
proposed for monitoring and assessing the status and trends 
of POPs in the environment and their impact on human health. 
The Stockholm Convention established a Global Monitoring 
Plan as a source of globally consistent and reliable data. 
Collection of data is at an early stage and more will become 
available in the coming years, but individual studies already 
provide historical and regional trends for some substances. An 
example is DDT, for which Ritter et al. (2011) report global time 
series of concentrations in human tissue from many individual 
measurements (Figure 6.5). In general, DDT body burdens have 
fallen over recent decades, but are still considerably higher in 
tropical than northern regions. Where DDT is used for malaria 
control, concentrations are still very high and the decrease is less 
pronounced than elsewhere. 

The other indicator for POPs is trends of selected atmospheric POPs 
in both urban/industrialized and remote regions. Concentrations 
of these substances in the air follow changes in emissions more 
closely than concentrations in food and human tissue, and reflect 
the effect of atmospheric long-range transport. Hung et al. (2010) 
provide a summary of long-term time trends of various POPs 
measured at Arctic monitoring stations. In general, concentrations 
of most substances in Arctic air show a falling trend, but

half-lives are often long – five to ten years and sometimes even 
longer. In recent years the decrease has come to a halt for several 
compounds, and some concentrations have been observed to be on 
the rise, for example polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), chlordane 
and DDT. Long-term trends for two PCBs are shown in Figure 6.6.

The environmental behaviour of POPs is strongly affected by 
temperature and other climate-related factors (UNEP/AMAP 2010; 
Macleod et al. 2005), including precipitation patterns, wind 
fields and extreme weather events. In general, climate change is 
expected to cause greater mobilization of POPs from primary and 
secondary sources as well as increased airborne transport (Lamon 
et al. 2009). It is unclear to what extent higher temperatures will 
accelerate the degradation of POPs, but the melting of ice in which 
they have been held for decades contributes to rising amounts of 
POPs and other pollutants in the environment (Bogdal et al. 2010).

Pesticides including POPs
Pesticides are compounds designed to kill specific pests but 
often reach non-target organisms as well. In one study, more than 
90 per cent of sampled water and fish were found to be 
contaminated by several pesticides and estimates indicated that

about 3 per cent of exposed agricultural workers suffer from an 
episode of acute pesticide poisoning every year (Thunduyil et al. 
2008). It is therefore imperative to know the nature of exposure 
and causes of contamination, and to identify action that can 
be taken to reduce pesticide levels in terrestrial and aquatic 
ecosystems. Long-term pesticide sales data constitute the main 
global and regional indicators of pesticide use (Brodesser et al. 
2006). The last 25 years have seen a reduction in insecticide 
sales due to mammalian toxicity concerns, although general 
pesticide sales increased from US$5.4 billion in 2004 to 
US$7.5 billion by 2009 in the Latin American region, with 
2,4-D, paraquat, methamidophos, methomyl, endosulfan and 
chlorpyrifos accounting for a high proportion of these sales 
(Brodesser et al. 2006).

Globally, the main 15 pesticides found in streams and 
groundwater include the herbicides atrazine and di-ethylatrazine, 
metolachlor, cyanazine and alachlor, and the insecticide 
diazinon. However, regarding fish, riverbed sediments and soils, 
the main pesticides still include persistent insecticides, heavily 
used in the 1960s and currently banned in most developed 
countries, such as DDT, dieldrin and chlordane. Moreover, 
endosulfan sulphate, the metabolite of endosulfan still in use in 
many countries, is a very common contaminant of surface and 
groundwater (Ondarza et al. 2011). Although the use of most 
organochlorine insecticides came to an end 10–25 years ago, 
they remain in the environment at levels of concern (Gonzalez 
et al. 2010; Ondarza et al. 2010).

More than 70 per cent of the populations of low-income countries 
live in rural areas, and 97 per cent of rural populations are 
engaged in agriculture. While developing countries account 
for just one-third of global pesticide use, the vast majority of 
pesticide poisonings occur in these countries (Brodesser  
et al. 2006).

The extent of human exposure and the health effects of 
pesticides under future climate change conditions will depend 
on the adoption of less toxic practices that take account of 
changes in factors such as temperature and precipitation 
(Boxall et al. 2009). 

Obsolete pesticides 
Pesticides become obsolete when they can no longer be used 
for their intended purpose. There are four major international 
agreements for their regulation: the Stockholm, Rotterdam and 
Basel Conventions and the 1998 Protocol on POPs to the 1979 
Geneva Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution 
(UNECE Geneva Convention 1979/98). It is difficult to estimate 
exact quantities of obsolete pesticides because many are very 
old and documentation is scarce. Parties to the Stockholm 
Convention are in the process of collecting information on 
nine POPs that were added to the convention’s annex in 2009, 
including hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH), and a good deal is 
known about dump sites of the latter even though some smaller 
sites may be missed. However, amounts of obsolete pesticides 
that do not fall under the Stockholm Convention remain vague 
and can only be roughly calculated. On the basis of experience 
in Africa and the Middle East, UNEP estimates that on average 
POP pesticides make up only around 30 per cent of all existing 
obsolete pesticides (UNEP 2000). 

Country-by-country assessments carried out by the International 
HCH and Pesticide Association (IHPA 2009) suggest that obsolete 
pesticides could amount to between 256 000 and 263 000 tonnes 
in the countries of the former Soviet Union, the Southern Balkans 
and new Member States of the European Union (defined as 
EU-12, EU accession countries, the countries of the European 
Neighbourhood Policy (ENP), the Russian Federation and Central 
Asia together), costing approximately US$780 million to dispose 
of, while some estimates for Africa by UNEP Chemicals suggested

that there may be as much as 120 000 tonnes remaining (UNEP 
2002), costing some US$200–250 million to dispose of, applying 
UN Food and Agriculture Organization cost estimates (FAO 2002). 
These assessments alone identify 376 000–383 000 tonnes for 
disposal at a cost of US$968–1 040 million. The most recent 
FAO figures, shown in Table 6.2, indicate that there are some 
290 000 tonnes of pesticide stockpiles with estimated disposal 
costs of US$3 000–5 000 per tonne (FAO 2012).

The Africa Stockpiles Programme (ASP), launched in 2005, 
aimed to clear all obsolete pesticides and contaminated 
waste in Africa within 10–15 years and to promote prevention 
measures and capacity building. It is very likely that the costs of 
inaction by far exceed the costs of cleaning up. As underlined by 
the European Environment Agency (EEA), downplaying the costs 
of inaction is a frequent phenomenon (Koppe and Keys 2001) 
and analysis suggests that the costs of inaction are high  
(OECD 2008c).

Metals, metalloids and heavy metals 
Inorganic pollutants, including metals and metalloids, also 
adversely impact human populations on a global scale 
(Blacksmith Institute 2011). Unlike organic chemicals, metallic 
elements do not degrade and may accumulate in the environment 
and become increasingly bio-available over time. Their impacts 
are often most severe in the developing countries where they are 
mined, processed, used and recycled with limited environmental 
control and regulation. Populations in more developed countries 
also suffer from historic and on-going industrial emissions 
of pollutants, as well as from associated releases of other 
pollutants such as sulphur oxides, which cause acid rain, and 
acid mine drainage (Carn et al. 2007). Contamination even 
extends to Antarctica, as industrial pollutant emissions are 
carried there by long-range atmospheric transport from other 
continents (Caroli et al. 2001). Pollutants can also be re-released 
after decades as glaciers melt (Geisz et al. 2008). 

Poisoning by naturally occurring arsenic is a global problem 
(Ravenscroft et al. 2009). More than a decade ago it was estimated 
that 130 million people around the world have been exposed 
to toxic levels of arsenic in drinking water, above the WHO 
recommended limit of 10 parts per billion (Smith and Lingus 
2000), but there is mounting evidence that arsenic toxicity occurs 
at levels below that standard (Wasserman et al. 2004). There are 
also many unexplored sources of arsenic and the total number of 
people affected may be higher (Huang et al. 2011). Associated 
toxicities include diabetes and skin, kidney, lung, neurological and 
vascular diseases – most notably blackfoot disease which leads to 
gangrene – and bladder cancer. These diseases are most prevalent 
in vulnerable populations living on subsistence diets of arsenic-
contaminated foods and with limited access to clean water, 
minerals and nutrients, which partially counteract that toxicity. 
Arsenic pollution in Bangladesh, which resulted from drilling wells 
to protect the population from surface waters contaminated with 
pathogens (Lokuge et al. 2004), has been described as “the largest 
poisoning of a population in history” (Smith and Lingus 2000). 
Populations in both developed and developing countries may 
be exposed to arsenic at contaminated sites left behind by the 
formerly widespread use of arsenic as a pesticide. 

Lead is among the most prominent of the global contaminants 
(Rauch and Pacyna 2009), with several activities being 
responsible for acute lead poisoning. There are on-going 
human health problems at previous mining and smelting sites, 
including in Kabwe, Nigeria (Nweke and Sanders 2009) and 
the Rudnaya River Valley, Russia (von Braun et al. 2002), where 
high lead levels in children persisted after the smelters in both 
areas were closed, and in La Oroya, Peru, where 99.7 per cent 
of the children living nearest the smelter were found to have 
dangerously high levels of lead in their systems (Fraser 2009). 
On a global scale, some 85 per cent of lead-acid batteries 
are recycled, but there are recycling sites such as in Dakar,

Senegal (Haefliger et al. 2009), where the average blood-lead 
concentration of children was at 130 micrograms per decilitre, 
enough to cause acute toxicity or even death (ATSDR 2007). 
Children may also be exposed to lead in paints, which has 
been phased out in developed countries but persists in some 
developing ones (Lanphear et al. 1998). Electronic waste 
recycling can also involve exposure to lead in solder, and there 
are sites such as Guiyu, China (Huo et al. 2007), where 82 
per cent of the children tested in the village had blood-lead 
concentrations above the US Centers for Disease Control action 
level of 10 micrograms per decilitre (ATSDR 2007). Although that 
level is two orders above the estimated natural lead level, there 
is no established lower threshold for lead toxicity in humans 
(Flegal and Smith 1992).

Most coals contain tiny proportions of mercury, so industrial 
mercury fluxes to the biosphere are projected to increase 
with greater fossil fuel combustion (Soerensen et al. 2010). 
While large amounts of mercury are thus released into the 
environment from numerous industrial activities, reports of 
acute neurotoxicity from mercury poisoning are now primarily 
associated with its use to amalgamate gold in artisanal mining, 
which is practised in more than 50 countries (Bose-O’Reilly 
et al. 2008). In Indonesia and Zimbabwe, all of the children 
tested in two mining areas were found to have elevated mercury 
levels and corresponding signs of mercury intoxication, whether 
they were directly involved in mining or not (Bose-O’Reilly 
et al. 2008). This poisoning of children is of special concern 
because mercury, even at sub-lethal levels, is a neurotoxin that 
can permanently impair development and – like some other 
toxins – foster auto-immune resistance, making children and 
adults more vulnerable to infection and disease, as has been 
found with artisanal gold miners in Brazil (Feingold et al. 2010). 
Currently, UNEP is convening an intergovernmental negotiating 
committee to prepare a global legally binding instrument on 
mercury: more than 100 countries are participating and a global 
treaty text is expected to be ready for adoption in late 2013 
(Selin and Selin 2006).

A number of other metals such as zinc, copper and manganese 
could have harmful human and environmental impacts at 
certain levels. Cadmium, which was once used in pigments 
and for electroplating, is the most toxic, and contaminated 
sites may remain. Its main uses now are in rechargeable nickel-
cadmium batteries, and collection and recycling of these items 
must be efficient if it is not to be released to the environment. 
Cadmium is also released into the environment by some fossil 
fuel combustion, and is in addition a natural contaminant in 
phosphate deposits, so may be transferred in fertilizers and 
taken up by root vegetables (Jarup and Akesson 2009). 

Radioactive material
Radioactive material has been in use since the 1890s, increasing 
significantly with the advent of nuclear energy in the 1940s 
and its exploitation in weapons, with a concomitant increase in 
the generation of radioactive waste and contaminated sites. In 
addition, the use of radioactive materials in industry, research 
and medicine continues and increases, as do the mining and 
processing of minerals containing elevated concentrations of 
naturally occurring radionuclides. Some contaminated sites 
have been remediated at significant cost, while others remain to 
be addressed. The rising cost and reduced availability of fossil 
fuels have from time to time favoured the adoption of nuclear 
power, as have recent concerns over greenhouse gas emissions. 
However, social attitudes to nuclear accidents such as those at 
Three Mile Island and Chernobyl – which are rare but can have 
a very high impact – have exerted a restraining influence. It was 
predicted in 2008 that the use of nuclear energy would increase 
by 15–45 per cent by 2020 and by 25–95 per cent by 2030 (IAEA 
2008a), but future activity is likely to be affected by responses to 
the more recent Fukushima disaster.

Radioactive waste takes many physical and chemical forms and 
has differing radioactive properties. The international system 
of classification (IAEA 2009a) links waste classes (exempt, very 
short lived, very low level, low level, intermediate level, high level) 
to options for management and disposal. Disposal is the final

There has been a growing trend for disposal facilities to undergo 
international peer-reviewed safety demonstration (IAEA 2006). 
In addition, the 2010 General Conference of the International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) created an International Working 
Forum on Regulatory Supervision of Legacy Sites (IAEA 2010), 
aimed at enhancing regulatory regimes, the professional 
development of regulators and the application of safety and 
environmental assessment.

EMERGING ISSUES 
Policy making and regulatory processes are naturally prone to 
lag behind rapid changes taking place in the global production 
and distribution of chemicals and wastes. The challenge is to 
protect human health and the environment from the undesirable 
effects of chemicals and wastes even when there are inadequate 
quantitative data and the potential life-cycle hazards of both old 
and new materials are incompletely understood. 

Nanomaterial and nanoparticles
Many new materials are produced as minute particles of a 
nanometre – or one-billionth of a metre – in size, and they 
exhibit chemical and biological properties that are quite 
different from those of the corresponding bulk materials. 
Commercial applications of nanomaterials include, for example, 
food packaging, personal care products, cosmetics and 
pharmaceuticals. Their unique properties make nanomaterials 
useful in cancer therapies, the neutralization of pollution or 
improvement of energy efficiency. However, safety testing is in 
its infancy and governments have been slow to adapt existing 
regulations to these new materials, even though they are widely 
marketed and some potential for human exposure has been 
identified (Morris et al. 2010). More research is needed for a better 
understanding of workplace and consumer exposure and related 
impacts on human health, especially as some of these materials 
are known to pass through the skin and are small enough to 
penetrate cell membranes and cause toxic effects at cellular and 
sub-cellular scales. Furthermore, very little is known about whether 
nanomaterials or nanoparticles are released from products when 
they are incinerated, buried or degrade over time, so it is possible 
that they will pose a serious waste disposal challenge. Sound 
decision making on nanotechnology has provoked much debate 
among developed-country regulators, and is increasingly doing so 
among the regulators of developing countries (Morris et al. 2010). 

Plastics in the environment
Plastics are ubiquitous in the environment. They are widely used 
in many products and have many formulations. The simple plastic 
bag is a prime example of how a utilitarian object can become 
an environmental hazard. More than 500 billion plastic bags are

step in the management of radioactive waste, generally in near-
surface or deep land-based facilities. Apart from high-level and 
some intermediate-level waste, the majority has been disposed 
of in such facilities. Table 6.3 presents an estimate of the global 
inventory of radioactive waste (IAEA 2008b).

About a hundred near-surface facilities exist, and others for 
disposal of waste of various levels are under development in 
a number of countries, although the process of selecting and 
designing a site is often contentious. Many nuclear reactors 
are ageing and will need to be decommissioned in the near 
future, resulting in radioactive waste and signalling the need for 
disposal facilities and trained professionals to operate them. As 
of 2 February 2012, 435 nuclear power reactors with a combined 
capacity of about 368 gigawatts are in operation in 30 countries, 
of which around 75 per cent are more than 20 years old, and 
63 plants with a combined capacity of 61 gigawatts are under 
construction in 14 countries (European Nuclear Society 2012).

Contracting Parties to the Joint Convention on Radioactive Waste 
and Spent Fuel increased steadily after its establishment in 1997 
to number 58 in April 2011, and are committed to ensuring a high 
level of safety in radioactive waste management. At the 2009 
triennial review meeting, the reports of 45 Contracting Parties 
were reviewed with the conclusion that there is a commitment 
to improve safety, make progress in building, maintaining and 
implementing legal/regulatory frameworks, and observe good 
practices in national radioactive waste management strategies 
and policies (IAEA 2009b). Despite progress since the 2006 
review meeting, however, the 2009 meeting concluded that  
much still needed to be done to meet the following challenges:
•	 implementation	of	national	policies	for	the	long-term	

management of spent fuel, including disposal;

•	 siting,	construction	and	operation	of	spent	fuel	and	

used every year but many are improperly disposed of, ending 
up as marine litter. This significant problem was highlighted in 
the UNEP Yearbook 2011 (UNEP 2011b), showing that discarded 
plastic debris forms a major component of marine litter, degrading 
into micro-pollutants in ocean gyres, fouling beaches in coastal 
waters, and entering the food chain where it is consumed by 
marine fauna such as turtles and sea birds, weakening or killing 
them by affecting their digestion, respiration and reproduction. 
There is concern that these plastics also act as transport vectors 
of persistent organic pollutants such as PCBs and similar 
compounds, with chronic effects on wildlife. The solution is sound 
management, preventing the escape or discharge of this material, 
yet rates of plastic recycling and reuse vary greatly, from more 
than 80 per cent in some EU countries to only a small percentage 
in many developing ones. The Global Programme of Action (GPA) 
for the protection of the Marine Environment from Land-based 
Activities and other local and regional initiatives are seeking to 
address this issue (Astudillo et al. 2009; Young et al. 2009).
 
Electronic waste
The high turnover of equipment in the information and 
communication technology industry has caused an increase in 
obsolete electrical and electronic products, which in turn has 
generated almost uncontrollable volumes of end-of-life products 
driving a global trade in e-waste. As the fastest growing waste 
stream in the world, estimated at 20-50 million tonnes per year, 
e-waste has become one of the major environmental challenges 
of the 21st century (Schwarzer et al. 2005). Generated by a wide 
range of electrical products, it is of particular interest because it 
contains not only hazardous substances including heavy metals 
such as mercury and lead, and endocrine-disrupting substances 
such as brominated flame retardants (BFRs), but also many 
strategic metals such as gold, palladium and rare earth metals 
that can be recovered and recycled. E-waste can thereby serve as 
a valuable source of secondary raw materials, reducing pressure

on scarce natural resources and the environmental footprint of 
the mining industry.

Developing countries nonetheless remain the destination of 
most of the e-waste exported from developed countries as 
second-hand or used equipment. Yet these countries often 
lack the infrastructure, capacity and resources for its sound 
management (UNEP 2009), with the informal sector and 
vulnerable groups employing crude processing methods such 
as open-air burning or acid leaching to recover valuable metals 
like copper and gold. In the process, toxic substances in the 
waste may be released into the environment, posing a high risk 
to ecological and human health. Recent studies have revealed 
that by 2016, developing countries will generate twice as much 
e-waste as developed countries (Zoeteman et al. 2010), but while 
electronic equipment has positive impacts on development and 
progress, it can have negative impacts on both human health and 
environmental integrity as end-of-life e-waste. This is a growing 
environmental and public health issue that threatens attainment 
of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in developing 
countries and economies in transition. 

Endocrine disruptors
Endocrine disruption is the term given to the alteration of 
hormonal signals in living systems when they are exposed to 
chemical substances. A considerable number of chemicals 
have been shown to be endocrine disruptors, affecting the 
growth and reproductive and neurological development of many 
species, including humans (Waye and Trudeau 2011; Gore 
and Patisaul 2010; Toppari et al. 1996; Colborn et al. 1993). 
In addition, the numerous chemical substances, both natural 
and anthropogenic, that are present in the environment in low 
concentrations come together to exacerbate exposure of both 
humans and wildlife. Many investigations have been conducted 
since publication of the Global Assessment of the State-of-the-
Science of Endocrine Disruptors (WHO 2002), and it is clear that 
both inorganic and organic substances can affect hormonal 
signalling. UNEP has proposed listing this as an emerging policy 
issue for listing under the Strategic Approach to International 
Chemicals Management (SAICM).

Open burning
In open burning, the pollutants produced by combustion are 
released directly to the air and so enter the environment in 
uncontrolled ways. Open burning can include forest wildfires, 
planned combustion activities such as burning stubble in 
preparation for a subsequent grain crop, irresponsible burning 
of waste such as domestic rubbish and e-waste, arson-initiated 
combustion of scrap tyres, and even public detonation of 
fireworks (Lemieux et al. 2004). Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 
(PAHs) are always released in these processes, and (in the 
case of fireworks) heavy metals such as lead and copper are 
also released. PAHs are widespread in the environment in both 
developed and developing countries (Barra et al. 2007), and 
concern about their carcinogenic properties has led to their 
classification as primary pollutants by agencies such as the US 
Environmental Protection Agency.

Gaps in the understanding of chemical toxicity
Since humans are continually exposed to a multitude of 
manufactured chemicals, there is a need to understand the 
behaviour of these chemicals and their interaction with  
human health and the environment. Previously unsuspected 
properties of widely used chemicals present legacy problems  
that raise concern in the scientific community and among the 
public. For example, of the many chemicals that have been  
found to have endocrine-disrupting properties, bisphenol-A  
is present in many plastic baby bottles and food can liners,  
and phthalate esters in various flexible plastics including  
some children’s toys (Hengstler et al. 2011). Consumer  
vigilance is not enough to prevent exposure in such cases 
because the presence of these chemicals is usually not evident 
to the non-expert. This places a heavy responsibility on public 
authorities to inform people about potential risks associated  
with manufactured chemicals, and on manufacturers to exercise 
the extended or individual producer responsibility approach  
and to search for alternatives. 

Most existing chemical regulations worldwide address the effects 
of individual substances. Managing single chemicals is difficult 
enough, but there is also concern about gaps in understanding 
human exposure to mixtures of chemicals (Rajapakse et al. 2002; 
Silva et al. 2002). As mentioned, little has been done to study 
the toxicology of mixtures. There is an urgent need for further 
risk assessment of the combined exposure of multiple chemicals 
– the chemical cocktail or synergistic effects – to human health 
and the environment. Integrated environmental risk assessments 
based on state-of-the-art dynamic pollutant modelling and 
toxicological experiments on chemical cocktails will help quantify 
planetary boundaries for chemical pollution (Handoh and Kawai 
2011; Rockström et al. 2009).

GAPS AND OUTLOOK 
Chemical properties, patterns of use and the 
environment
There is a lack of information about the health and environmental 
effects of many chemical substances and about the products in 
which different types of chemicals are used (OECD 2008b). 
Huge gaps in the assessment of chemicals arise from two causes. 
First, many were introduced and became established items of 
commerce before systematic assessments began. Where there is 
mounting evidence of harm or potential harm, action can lead to 
regional controls and eventual listing under global conventions, 
but most industrial chemicals remain unassessed. Second, 
concerns have arisen over hitherto unsuspected properties such 
as the endocrine activity of phthalates and bisphenol A, for 
example, or long-range transport coupled with bioaccumulation. 
Furthermore, academic assessment suggests the potential for 
further industrial chemicals and pesticides to qualify as POPs 
(Muir and Howard 2010, 2006). It should also be noted that 
wastes are often mixed, which makes it extremely difficult to 
assess the risks of any chemicals present. In addition, residues 
arising from the recycling of hazardous waste may contain a 
higher concentration of toxic materials than the recyclable 
materials themselves.

Long-term monitoring programmes for POPs in the environment 
as well as in human tissue need to be maintained and expanded, 
in particular in the southern hemisphere. They are essential for a 
better understanding of trends in global chemical pollution and 
for the Stockholm Convention’s evaluation of effectiveness.

More extensive work on chemical toxicity inventories is aiming 
to fill a significant gap. An example is the European legislation 
on Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of 
Chemicals (REACH). This has extended the number of chemicals 
covered by regulations, notably those that were on the market 
before 1981 and previously exempt (Chapter 11).

Limited information on chemicals in products makes it difficult 
to document the extent of the risk posed to human health 
and the environment. Initiatives such as the ongoing UNEP 
Global Chemicals Outlook and the Cost of Inaction (UNEP 
Mainstreaming of Chemicals) will help to fill some important 
knowledge gaps. 

In addition to scientific knowledge gaps, sound chemicals and 
waste management is also hampered by a lack of resources, 
capacity and compliance monitoring. A lack of education and 
training also limits appropriate management of chemicals and 
wastes in many developing countries. Increased trade resulting 
from free trade agreements can complicate this picture (Vogel 
1997), as such agreements may well exert even more pressure 
on emerging economies with respect to regulating or restricting 
chemical use. 

Chemicals, wastes and drinking water 
At the global level, about 1.1 billion people do not have access 
to a safe water supply and 2.6 billion people do not have access 
to adequate sanitation facilities. The associated health impacts 
are alarming: 1.7 million deaths per year, of which 90 per cent 
are children under five years of age (WHO/UNICEF 2005). The 
costs of water pollution may represent between 0.3 and 1.9 per 
cent of rural gross domestic product (GDP) (WHO/UNICEF 2005). 
Industrial sectors with the potential for significant water pollution 
include the chemicals sector, food and beverage sector, textile and 
mining industry and pulp and paper sector. The policy framework 
for regulating the industrial point sources of water pollution is 
well developed in most OECD countries, although some pollutants 
such as heavy metals and chlorinated solvents remain a concern. 
Increasing attention is being paid to non-point sources, such as 
agricultural run-off, which are more difficult to regulate but can 
lead to nitrate pollution of water bodies. In addition to efforts 
to reduce the run-off of organic pollutants from fertilizers and 
manure, organophosphates from pesticides are also a concern. 
Studies reviewed by the OECD (2008a, 2008b) suggest that 
national measures to reduce agricultural run-off and manage storm 
water, including targeted measures to reduce a variety of different 
pollutants such as arsenic and nitrates, could yield health benefits 
in excess of US$100 million in large OECD economies (Hammer et 
al. 2011). In non-OECD countries, the cost of inaction with respect 
to unsafe water supply and sanitation is particularly acute.

Box 6.6 Funding: an ongoing challenge 

Much effort at the intergovernmental level goes into identifying 
the funding and support needs of capacity building, technical 
assistance and institutional strengthening for the sound 
management of chemicals and waste in developing countries 
and economies in transition. This is reflected in the decisions 
of the Conferences of the Parties to the Basel, Rotterdam and 
Stockholm Conventions, especially for national implementation 
plans. International funding for implementation of the 
chemicals and wastes agenda is currently managed and 
channelled through the World Bank, Global Environment 
Facility (GEF), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), 
UNEP, the United Nations Industrial Development Organization 
(UNIDO), the United Nations Institute for Training and Research 
(UNITAR), FAO, WHO and the Quick Start Programme of SAICM, 
as well as the OECD and regional development banks. Some 
funding is also available through private-sector bodies. In 
addition, SAICM, the Inter-Organization Programme for the 
Sound Management of Chemicals (IOMC), Intergovernmental 
Forum on Chemical Safety (IFCS), and Organisation for the 
Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) play supportive and 
coordinating roles. 

•	 industry	involvement,	including	private-public	partnerships	

and the use of economic instruments at the national and 
international levels; 

•	 a	new	trust	fund	similar	to	the	Multilateral	Fund;	and	
•	 introducing	safe	chemicals	and	waste	management	as	
a new GEF focal area, expanding the existing POPs focal 
area under GEF or establishing a new trust fund under 
the GEF. 

The final meeting of the Consultative Process in October 2011 
resulted in a document outlining an integrated approach 
to financing the sound management of chemicals and 
wastes (UNEP 2012). This formed the basis of a report by 
the UNEP Executive Director to the UNEP Governing Council 
Special Session in February 2012, which in turn resulted in 
governments requesting the Executive Director for a fully-
fledged proposal on an integrated approach ensuring optimal 
funding for the chemicals and wastes sector. A decision on 
this is expected at the third SAICM International Conference 
on Chemicals Management in September 2012 and the UNEP 
Governing Council in 2013. 

The existing approach is hampered by fragmentation, 
disconnections and insufficient coordination, and adequate 
funding remains a fundamental challenge. For example, lack of 
agreement on funding has played a significant part in delaying 
establishment of a compliance mechanism for the Stockholm 
Convention. As a result, in 2009 the Executive Director of UNEP 
launched the Consultative Process on Financing Options for 
Chemicals and Wastes to look at overall funding needs and 
possibilities. Between 2009 and 2011 participants discussed 
four tracks:
•	 mainstreaming	of	sound	management	of	chemicals	and	

hazardous wastes; 

The follow-up to the Consultative Process is an important 
opportunity to raise the profile of financing for sound 
management of chemicals and wastes and links to human 
health and development, the environment and carbon. It 
is an intrinsic component of development and a necessary 
objective to bring lasting social, environmental and economic 
benefits. Without adequate infrastructure in the key sectors of 
health, water, sanitation, energy, transport, information and 
communication technology, and disaster management, there 
is little hope of protecting people from the risks of exposure to 
harmful chemicals, hazardous or radioactive waste and other 
waste streams contaminating the environment.

Reinforcing a global response
The Basel, Rotterdam and Stockholm Conventions and other 
instruments that address chemicals and wastes – including the 
Montreal Protocol on Ozone-Depleting Substances, MARPOL, 
the London Convention, and regional treaties like the Bamako, 
Waigani or Mediterranean Conventions, as well as the future 
Minamata Convention on Mercury – represent the foundation 
on which to build and consolidate a global response to protect 
human health and the environment from the adverse effects of 
chemicals and waste. Discussions conducted under the auspices 
of these global instruments enable emerging problems to be 
foreseen and facilitate the formulation of ways to manage issues 
soundly and collectively on a sustainable basis. All these global 
legally binding instruments, as well as regional agreements such 
as those agreed by the OECD and the European Commission, 
share the universal principle of an environmentally sound 
management of chemicals and waste. A key feature of this global 

architecture is transparency in the collection and dissemination 
of information. The EU chemicals legislation, REACH, is 
exemplary of such efforts (Hartung and Rovida, 2009). But large 
gaps remain, both in addressing the number of chemicals and 
nanomaterials present in the market, and in the fact that many 
countries are unable to manage hazardous chemicals and waste 
in an environmentally sound way.

With the Basel, Rotterdam and Stockholm Conventions sharing 
the common objective of protecting human health and the 
environment from hazardous chemicals and wastes, the Parties 
to these agreements have embarked on rationalizing their 
operations to improve assistance to countries in managing 
chemicals at different stages of their life cycle. This has been 
exemplified by the establishment of the International Panel 
on Chemical Pollution (IPCP) in 2008, enhanced cooperation 
and coordination between the three conventions during their 

186

Part 1: State and Trends

respective Conferences of the Parties in 2008 and 2009, and 
their simultaneous extraordinary meetings in Bali, Indonesia, 
in February 2010. Since early 2011, the convention secretariats 
have been working under a joint Executive Secretary, opening 
up the possibility of a more holistic approach to the sound 
management of chemicals and waste (Basel Convention 2012).

Outlook
Table 6.4 summarizes the main goals into key themes and uses the 
indicators described in this chapter to illustrate progress towards 
their achievement. It also makes recommendations for consideration 
alongside those from other chapters in Part 1 when developing policy 
options and responses as outlined in Parts 2 and 3. 

Table 6.4 Progress towards goals (see Table 6.1) 

A: Significant progress 
B: Some progress 

C: Very little to no progress 
D: Deteriorating

X: Too soon to assess progress
?: Insufficient data 

Key issues and goals
1. Provide sound management of chemicals throughout their life cycle and of waste 
Sound management of 
chemicals

State and trends 

B

Outlook

Gaps

The number of developing 
countries implementing sound 
chemicals management is 
increasing

Waste production will increase 
according to current trends in 
consumption and trade

Environmentally sound energy 
recovery will benefit some 
situations if balanced with 
emphasis on waste recovery for 
reuse and recycling rather than 
competing with energy solutions 
Potential to raise many of these 
efforts to a global level

Trend may continue if Parties 
are not supported in improving 
compliance and changing 
direction

Continuing exposure to POPs in 
all parts of the world is likely; 
climate change may increase 
exposure due to greater 
mobilization of POPs

Strengthening of the life-cycle approach; a more 
integrated global framework for risk assessment 
and risk management of chemicals; plans for the 
implementation of sound management of chemicals, 
most notably for developing countries heavily involved 
in the production, trade and use of chemicals, 
particularly in Asia and the Pacific and Latin America
Data on waste

Technology transfer and capacity building for the 
long term to ensure the performance of any facility 
is maintained 

Global measurement methodology and data 
on waste minimization; reliable data and trend 
information 

Additional effort on awareness raising and capacity 
building

Support to developing countries for their national 
implementation plans under the Stockholm 
Convention;
greater attention to DDT exposure from malaria 
control, and exposure to polybrominated diphenyl 
ethers (among other chemicals) from handling 
e-waste 

17 multilateral agreements are in place and 
over 300 activities have been conducted 
under the SAICM Global Plan of Action; 
23 countries have a functioning national 
chemical register; a globally harmonized 
system of classification and labelling of 
chemicals has been established 
Objective standards of environmentally 
sound waste management are not optimal; 
practices vary widely according to local 
norms and conditions; cities face increasing 
problems with management of municipal 
waste, poor monitoring and open burning, 
and illegal traffic in waste 
Efficient ways of transforming waste into 
energy, applicable in developing countries, 
are lacking

Sound management of 
waste

Improve resource 
efficiency

C

?

Many initiatives and some regional and 
national programmes exist, including 
Reduce, Reuse, Recycle; EU Producer 
Responsibility Directives; Basel Mobile 
Phone Partnership; and Basel Partnership 
Action on Computer Equipment
Data from national reporting to the Basel 
Convention Secretariat is sparse and 
difficult to interpret; reporting by Parties is 
declining

Prevent and minimize 
waste by maximizing 
reuse, recycling and 
environmentally 
friendly alternative 
materials
Strict control of 
the generation and 
management of hazardous 
and other waste
2. Protect human health and the environment from POPs
Eliminate or restrict the 
production, use, import 
and export of POPs

?

B/B/B B: Some progress, but it is still too early 
to evaluate headway on the basis of the 
indicators; B: long-term records show a 
decrease in atmospheric POP concentrations 
during the 1980s and 1990s, but trends have 
levelled off since 2000; B: in urban regions 
of Western industrialized countries PCB 
emissions are ongoing and of the order of 
0.1–1.0 gram per person per year

3. Reduction of the risks posed by heavy metals
Restrict production and 
use of heavy metals

B

Progress in developed countries has resulted 
in a less frequent occurrence of acute toxicity, 
but exposure still occurs at industrial and 
legacy sites, and there is increasing concern 
regarding possible subtle developmental 
effects of chronic, low-level exposure; 
significant problems remain in developing 
countries, where heavy metals are often mined, 
processed, used and recycled with limited 
control, and where most cases of acute toxicity 
occur, particularly for lead, mercury and arsenic

Ongoing global negotiations 
on mercury are positive, and 
further efforts are required 
to include heavy metals 
(lead, cadmium, arsenic) in 
international agreements

Additional research into alternative, more benign 
chemicals for use in consumer goods to help 
reduce the heavy metal burden to the environment; 
more stringent occupational, human health and 
environmental standards

Chemicals and Waste 187

Table 6.4 Progress towards goals (see Table 6.1) continued
3. Reduction of the risks posed by heavy metals continued
Restrict import and 
export of heavy 
metals, and waste 
containing heavy 
metals

B

The rapid turnover of e-products and high 
cost of eliminating the hazardous substances 
within them have led to growth in the trade 
and movement of e-waste to developing 
countries where labour costs and health and 
environmental standards are lower
Much controlled disposal takes place 
in developed countries, but work is still 
needed in many developing countries 
to improve disposal following mining, 
smelting, battery and e-waste recycling 

?

Improve waste 
disposal techniques 
for waste containing 
heavy metals

EU directive on the restriction of 
certain hazardous substances in 
e-waste is a positive step; global 
initiatives are also required

Global initiatives such as that on mercury would be 
beneficial

Internationally agreed goals 
for lead, mercury and possibly 
other heavy metals exist or are in 
development; further efforts are 
required

More stringent occupational, human health and 
environmental standards, as well as more stringent 
regulations surrounding disposal

4. Promote shared responsibility and cooperative efforts between Parties in the international trade of certain hazardous chemicals
Develop national 
decision-making 
processes for the 
import and export of 
hazardous chemicals

Foreseeable improvement if the 
rate of notifications under the 
Rotterdam Convention continues 
or is enhanced

Improvement of mechanisms, governance and a 
regulatory framework for effective decision making 
at regional and national levels, including promoting 
synergy in the implementation of international 
chemical and waste agreements

C

Many developing countries lack policies on 
sound management, with weak institutional 
and regulatory frameworks and poor 
enforcement of existing laws; there is no 
coherent approach for national decision-
making, with a multiplicity of government 
agencies having mandates for the import 
and export of hazardous chemicals, causing 
jurisdictional conflict and weakening 
decision-making 
There is a lack of datasets and effective 
mechanisms available to national, regional 
and international stakeholders for the 
retrieval and dissemination of information 
about chemicals’ characteristics; poor 
information exchange between government 
agencies at the national level is hindering 
informed decision making 

?

Facilitate information 
exchange 
about chemical 
characteristics

Development and implementation of functional 
international, regional and national networks for the 
exchange of information on the characteristics of 
hazardous chemicals and wastes

Data on children’s vulnerability to chemical 
risk (average risk assessment only uses adult 
data); training in chemicals identification and 
risk management under the auspices of SAICM; 
disclosure of product composition

?

5. Use transparent science-based risk assessment and risk management procedures
Sound management 
of chemicals 
throughout their life 
cycle

Risk assessment is being used at the 
international level (Stockholm Convention), 
but is constrained in developing countries 
by the lack of data on exposure and effects 
caused by chemicals and wastes, and also 
by capacity constraints

The situation may improve 
through the activities of the 
convention review committees, 
the intergovernmental process on 
mercury, EU REACH and national 
reassessments of chemicals

Under the Montreal Protocol, training has 
been provided for ozone officers to detect 
illegal shipments; the Globally Harmonized 
System (GHS) for labelling of chemicals in 
the workplace is hazard-based and can be 
used as input to risk assessment

There is uncertainty about both the 
hazardousness of certain chemicals and the 
risk they pose; chemicals in products are 
often not identified, sometimes for reasons 
of commercial confidentiality
Historically, investment in marine pollution 
research has been more active in the 
northern hemisphere; more recently, 
important efforts are being made in 
the developing world to protect marine 
resources – often an important food source 
– from pollution

A

Encourage research 
in order to prevent, 
eliminate and reduce 
pollution of the 
marine environment

6. Develop adequate monitoring systems (national, regional and global)
Develop sound 
science-based 
monitoring 
programmes

?

For POPs, the Global Monitoring Plan is 
in place; for a wide range of additional 
chemicals, biomonitoring programmes are 
inadequate in most countries and human 
exposure is incompletely documented; 
hazardous waste reporting systems 
are available for Parties to the Basel 
Convention but are not fully taken up or 
reported; the impacts of waste due to 
unsound disposal are difficult to quantify

188

Part 1: State and Trends

Scientifically sound data on contamination

Global monitoring programmes 
involving chemicals are being 
developed and harmonization 
and global coverage are expected 
to be reached in the coming years

Comprehensive regional and global monitoring 
programmes for building spatial and temporal trends 
of key chemicals and wastes, as well as datasets and 
indicators to enable monitoring of change; biomarkers 
and bioindicators to assist the assessment of chemical 
exposure and effects; training and appropriate 
laboratory facilities in developing countries, and 
support to build capacity for monitoring hazardous 
residues imported from developed countries (storage, 
disposal or reprocessing)

Sound 
C
management of 
chemicals and 
hazardous wastes

Situation likely to improve 
if Stockholm and Basel 
Conventions, SAICM and the 
GHS can be supported through 
innovative financing mechanisms

An adequate financing mechanism, as well as 
information and knowledge sharing between north 
and south

In spite of efforts by international agencies, 
capacity development for sound management 
in developing countries is still lacking; Basel 
and Stockholm Convention Regional Centres 
have been established to enhance the 
capacity of governments and stakeholders in 
developing countries, but adequate financing 
mechanisms are not yet in place
Waste disposal rather than integrated waste 
management is practised without resource 
and materials recovery, and national waste 
policy and legislations on integrated waste 
management as well as infrastructure for 
collection are inadequate; crude and resource-
inefficient recycling exists in the informal 
economy 
The control system available via the Basel 
Convention’s prior informed consent 
notification process can work very well when 
fully utilized, though the process is vulnerable 
to circumvention and illegal traffic

B

?

Improve resource 
efficiency

Control of 
transboundary 
movements of 
hazardous waste

Environmentally sound 
management of waste instead 
of indiscriminate disposal and 
uncontrolled open burning

Promotion of regional and national initiatives on 
waste-to-energy and waste-to-organic-fertilizers, 
along with waste recycling and materials recovery 
through pilot/demonstration projects

Full national implementation 
of the Basel Convention and 
measures under SAICM, along 
with further stimulus, would 
improve the rate of progress 

Improved capacity building and funding mechanisms 
to sustain implementation and compliance of 
the Basel Convention; elaboration of synergistic 
convention initiatives at the regional and national 
levels; improved cooperation between international, 
regional and national networks for controlling the 
transboundary movement of hazardous waste

Greater cooperation, for example through the European 
IMPEL and global INECE networks, to improve compliance 
and enforcement, together with Interpol Pollution 
Crimes Working Group initiatives; better reporting as 
well as active collaboration and cooperation with Basel 
Convention focal points in developing countries

Likely to improve with the 
development of new mechanisms 
under MEPC

Development and implementation of functional 
international networks for the control of ships’ 
wastes, including disposal facilities in ports

Mixed

International action to promote the ratification, 
transposition into national law and implementation 
of MARPOL, the regional seas conventions and the 
London Convention at the regional and national 
levels, as well as to develop multilateral agreements 
on chemicals and waste

A closer link between the Joint Convention (already 
an important global instrument for safe management 
of radioactive waste) and other international 
instruments on hazardous materials to develop 
beneficial synergies; support for international efforts 
to assist with remediation of uranium mining legacy 
sites

More emphasis to ensure that the objectives of 
the Convention on Nuclear Safety and the Joint 
Convention are achieved

Radioactive waste will continue 
to be generated by the nuclear 
industry, medical and industrial 
uses and mining and mineral 
exploitation, with elevated 
levels of naturally occurring 
radionuclides; management and 
disposal facilities will be needed 
in the foreseeable future
A number of countries have 
decided to phase out their 
nuclear programmes following 
the Fukushima accident while 
others continue to develop their 
programmes; it is too early to say 
what the overall impact will be

X

Progress has been made under the MARPOL 
Convention – 150 countries have ratified 
although many are yet to comply; control of 
greenhouse gas emissions from international 
shipping, and a draft of the reduction 
mechanisms themselves are under further 
consideration by the International Maritime 
Organization’s Marine Environment Protection 
Committee (MEPC)
Protection of the marine environment has not 
always been given priority by institutional 
arrangements or by environmental regulations 
in developing countries; UNEP’s regional seas 
conventions have not all been transposed into 
law or implemented; many countries have not 
ratified or implemented MARPOL; the level 
of coastal and marine pollution continues to 
increase, with a lack of control of land-based 
sources of pollution at the regional and 
national levels; unsustainable exploitation of 
marine resources and the marine environment 
is widespread

Radioactive waste from the operation of nuclear 
facilities and uses of radioactive material in 
medicine, industry and research are generally 
controlled according to international standards 
and reported at meetings of the Joint Convention 
on Spent Fuel and Radioactive Waste; some 
legacy sites remain from nuclear weapons 
production and testing; some uranium mining 
legacy sites remain in Africa and Central Asia 
The Fukushima accident illustrates that nuclear 
accidents can still occur despite improvements 
since Chernobyl, and the Convention on 
Nuclear Safety (sister convention to the Joint 
Convention) is intended to ensure countries 
maintain a high level of safety

Main Messages 

The changes discussed in Chapters 2–6 are taking 
place within an integrated, interconnected whole 
that is the Earth System. Humans are an integral 
part of that system.

as of temperature and sea level rise affect the social 
cohesion of indigenous communities: in Alaska, for 
example, permafrost thawing and increased flooding 
are forcing villages to relocate.

The Earth System is complex and composed of 
interacting components. Non-linear interactions 
within and among these components, supplemented 
by the inherent difficulties in anticipating human 
behaviour, impose limits on the predictability of the 
Earth System. 

As human pressures within the Earth System 
increase, several critical thresholds are approaching 
or have been exceeded, beyond which abrupt and 
non-linear changes to the life-support functions 
of the planet could occur. This has significant 
implications for human well-being now and in 
the future. For example: climate variability and 
extreme weather influence food security; crossing 
of thresholds leads to significant health impacts, 
as shown by the increase in malaria in response 
to rising temperatures; increased frequency and 
severity of climatic events affect both natural assets 
and human security; and accelerating changes such 

Traditional expert-driven, top-down approaches to 
problem solving are not flexible enough to address 
complex, non-linear changes in the Earth System 
effectively. After more than 20 years of tackling 
problems of unsustainable development as more 
or less isolated issues, an integrated Earth Systems 
approach is needed for informed and effective 
decision-making.

There is an urgent need to address the underlying 
drivers of the human pressures on the Earth 
System. At the same time, it is necessary to 
adopt approaches that can deal better with the 
complexities and inherent uncertainties of the Earth 
System. This must include three elements: basic 
research to understand interactions and feedbacks; 
sustained long-term monitoring and observation to 
underpin basic research; and regular evaluation of 
progress to allow the adjustment of responses when 
observations indicate that this is necessary.

Part 1: State and Trends

INTRODUCTION
The first pictures of the Earth from space stimulated an 
immediate and profound appreciation of its finite boundaries. 
Scientific advancements continue to enable a better view of the 
Earth as a whole. This includes a combination of surface and 
remote-sensing global observation systems that can document 
global-scale phenomena, advances in the ability to reconstruct 
past states of the environment, and enhanced computing 
power to conduct global-scale simulation experiments (Steffen 
et al. 2004b). Evidence shows that human activities are now so 
pervasive and profound in their consequences that they affect 
the Earth at a planetary scale.

Following on from Chapter 1, which highlighted major drivers 
of change, and Chapters 2–6, which illustrated environmental 
changes and their impacts at the local, regional and even global 
levels, this chapter discusses change from an Earth System 
perspective and provides a context for steering transitions in the 
way we live, work and govern the planet.

THE EARTH SYSTEM
A system is a collection of component parts that interact with 
one another within a defined boundary. The Earth System is 
a complex social-environmental system, including the vast 
collection of interacting physical, chemical, biological and 
social components and processes that determine the state 
and evolution of the planet and life on it. The biophysical 
components of the Earth System are often referred to as 
spheres: atmosphere, biosphere, hydrosphere and geosphere. 
They provide environmental processes that regulate the 
functioning of the Earth, such as the climate system, the 

ecological services generated by the living biosphere, 
including food production, and natural resources like fossil 
fuels and minerals. Humans are an integral part of the Earth 
System. All spheres include countless subsystems and levels 
of organization. The interactions within and between these 
spheres are complex and the predictability of future states of 
the Earth System is limited. 

Unprecedented changes
Some experts suggest that the Earth has entered a new 
geological epoch, the Anthropocene (Zalasiewicz et al. 2011, 
2010). The word was coined by Nobel Laureate Paul Crutzen to 
capture the idea that humans are now overwhelming the forces of 
nature. An implication of entering the Anthropocene would be the 
leaving of the Holocene, the interglacial period that has provided 
humanity, over the past 10 000 years, with extraordinarily good 
living conditions, enabling the development of modern societies 
and a world with 7 billion people (Folke et al. 2011).

Crutzen (2002) suggests that the Industrial Revolution 250 years 
ago saw the beginning of the Anthropocene. The unprecedented 
rise in human population since the early 19th century, from 
less than a billion to 7 billion at present, is inherent to the 
Anthropocene as it unfolds (Zalasiewicz et al. 2010). Many 
societal changes have accompanied this proliferation of the 
human population, such as increased consumption of natural 
resources and an enormous expansion of dependence on fossil 
fuels (Chapter 1).

The Earth System demonstrates complexity in its natural 
variability independently of, and previous to, human influence.

An Earth System Perspective 195

Ice cores in Antarctica have shown that during the past 800 000 
years, air temperature and carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations 
have oscillated within a relatively limited range (Luethi et al. 
2008), with variations that could be largely linked to factors such 
as the irregularities of the Earth’s rotation and motion along its 
orbit around the Sun (Hays et al. 1976). Current concentrations 
of atmospheric CO2 are, however, well outside the range of the 
past (Figure 7.1), having risen from 310 parts per million (ppm) 
in 1950 to 391 ppm in 2011 (NOAA 2011), with half the total rise 
in atmospheric CO2 since the pre-industrial era having occurred 
in the last 30 years (Steffen et al. 2007). 

Biodiversity, the variety of life on Earth, has evolved over the last 
3.8 billion years or so of the planet’s approximately 5-billion-year 
history. Five major extinction events have been recorded over 
this period, but, unlike the previous events – which were due 
to natural upheavals and planetary change – the current loss 
of biodiversity is mainly due to human activities and is often 
referred to as the sixth global extinction (Barnosky et al. 2011; 
Eldredge 2001). According to the Global Biodiversity Outlook 
3 (CBD 2010), the abundance of some vertebrate populations 
fell by nearly one-third on average between 1970 and 2006 and 
continues to fall globally. Many biologists consider that coming 
decades will see the loss of large numbers of species (Leadley et al. 
2010), increasing the risk of abrupt change in landscapes and 

seascapes (Estes et al. 2011). Fewer scientists appear to have 
recognized that, in the longer term, these extinctions will alter 
not only biological diversity but also the evolutionary processes 
by which diversity is generated (Myers and Knoll 2001). 

Earth System interactions
Given the interconnections between the different spheres of the 
Earth System, changes in one part of the system have effects 
in one or more of the others. Box 7.1 shows examples from 
Chapters 2–6 that illustrate Earth System interactions between 
spheres and how they are being changed by human activities.

EARTH SYSTEM COMPLEXITIES 
The complexity of the Earth System is associated with its 
countless interacting processes, at many scales and levels of 
system organization. Importantly, these interactions mean that 
changes rarely occur in linear and incremental ways. Instead, 
the dominant behaviour when the various systems on Earth 
undergo change is for it to happen in a non-linear way, driven by 
feedbacks that either dampen change (negative feedbacks) or 
reinforce it (positive feedbacks) (Steffen et al. 2004a). Many such 
feedbacks shape the Earth System. 

Positive feedbacks are increases in system reaction that may 
destabilize the system and move it into another state – a regime

Part 1: State and Trends

shift (Box 7.2). An example of a positive feedback is the effect 
of black carbon deposition in the Arctic (McConnell et al. 2007). 
Black carbon particles are emitted into the atmosphere from the 
incomplete combustion of biomass and fossil fuels (Chapter 2).  
The Arctic climate is especially vulnerable to black carbon 
deposition because of its impact on the albedo (reflectivity) 
of snow, glaciers and sea ice. Black carbon makes the surface 
darker, thus reflecting less radiation, which leads to an increase 
in warming and ice/snow melt. Ramanathan and Carmichael 
(2008) report that, at high elevations in the Himalayas, positive 
feedback from the increased absorption of solar radiation by 
black carbon may be as important in the melting of snowpack and 
glaciers as are the rising temperatures that result from increased 
atmospheric CO2.

An important relationship between the temperature and carbon 
content of the Earth’s atmosphere manifests itself both on 
relatively short and on geological timescales (Pagini et al. 
2010), and is the result of many contributing feedbacks in the 
atmosphere and other components of the Earth System. For 
example, with the higher temperature and greater acidity of 
ocean waters, the ability of the ocean to act as a carbon sink 
weakens (Steffen et al. 2004b). This positive feedback is one  
that increases system reaction and is thus destabilizing. 

Another destabilizing feedback, increasingly discussed in 
climate science, is related to the carbon reservoirs in the Arctic 
permafrost. If rising temperatures lead to permafrost thaw, this 
will release carbon and lead to further increases in temperature 
and consequently to even more permafrost thaw and more 
releases of carbon (Krey et al. 2009).

response to anthropogenic CO2 emissions. © Eugenio Opitz

The role of biodiversity in such feedback processes is not 
currently well understood because of the complexity of 
interactions in physical, chemical and biological processes. It 
is, however, well known that a positive feedback, which could 
enhance climate change, will occur if the carbon stored below 
ground is released to the atmosphere by accelerated respiration 
induced by soil warming (Rustad et al. 2001). 

A negative feedback is when the initial response is suppressed, 
which tends to be stabilizing. For example, if increased water 
in the atmosphere leads to greater cloud cover, this raises the 
percentage of sunlight reflected away from the Earth (albedo), 
which leads to a fall in the temperature of the atmosphere and a 
decrease in the rate of evaporation (Schmidt et al. 2010). 

So far, the dominant aggregate response of the Earth System to 
human pressure has been to dampen its impacts (Steffen et al. 
2004b). This is explained by the inherent resilience of the Earth 
System, where the biosphere interacts with the climate system, 
in particular, to buffer disturbances including some induced by 
humans. As a result, as a negative feedback response to CO2 
emissions from human activities, the global carbon sink in the 
biosphere has increased from approximately 2 billion tonnes 
of carbon per year in the 1960s to approximately 4 billion in 
2005 (Canadell et al. 2007). However, there are indications that 
the capacity of the biosphere to buffer pressures from global 
environmental change is declining (Le Quéré et al. 2009), and 
there is growing evidence of positive feedbacks occurring at 
the local level, for example eutrophication of lakes (Qin et al. 
2007), through to the regional level, such as accelerated melting 
of Arctic ice cover due to a regional amplification of warming 
(Serreze and Barry 2011). 

An Earth System Perspective 197

Box 7.2 Regime shifts 

Ecological regime shifts that occur when a certain threshold 
is passed are usually abrupt, with the change in response 
far greater than the change in forcing (change in drivers). 
Regime shifts can also be long-lasting, with concomitant 
impacts on human economies and societies (Briggs et al. 
2009). Some ecosystems may be highly vulnerable to change 
when subjected to the synergistic effects of two or more 
disturbances with a combined impact greater than the sum 
of their separate effects (Folke et al. 2004). An example is a 
pastureland that is exposed to the combined effects of drought 
and overgrazing, leading to alterations in soils, biodiversity 
and productivity, and resulting in a new ecosystem with 
different structural and functional characteristics. This is 
an example of gradual changes in feedbacks (Wysham and 
Hastings 2008; Levin 1998). In contrast, the shift of an 
ecosystem from one state to another can also result from 
catastrophic or extreme external perturbations (van Nes and 
Scheffer 2007), as illustrated below.

Three examples of regime shifts are shown in Figure 7.2. The 
first shows how the synergistic effect of drought and bark 
beetle infestation in northern New Mexico, United States, 
led to a high mortality of ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), 
which was replaced by a piñon-juniper woodland and was 

thus manifested as a loss of forested area. This is one of the 
most rapid landscape-scale regime shifts recorded (Allen and 
Breshears 1998).

The second example is also rapid, but the underlying cause is 
quite different. de Young et al. (2008) illustrated the effects of 
interactions between organisms. A species-specific pathogen 
on Caribbean coral reefs caused mass mortalities of sea 
urchins in the early 1980s. Urchin densities dropped to 1 per 
cent of their original level, which in turn enabled brown fleshy 
algae, no longer subject to grazing, to overgrow the reef. The 
reef community had undergone a regime shift. The new state 
persisted in some areas for more than 20 years, although the 
shift had occurred within one or two years for both the trigger 
(the pathogen) and the algal dominance. 

Brown et al. (1997) described a shift from a grass- to a 
shrub-dominated ecosystem over a period of about ten 
years in a semi-arid site in southern Arizona, United States. 
The single factor driving this was a slowly changing driver: 
seasonal precipitation. Winter precipitation favoured the 
expansion of woody shrubs over grass species, giving rise 
to the extinction of several animal species and increases in 
other previously rare ones.

EARTH SYSTEM CHANGES AND IMPLICATIONS FOR 
HUMAN WELL-BEING
The key Earth System changes discussed above have impacts 
on the environment, on economies and on societies. Illustrative 
and by no means comprehensive examples of these impacts 
follow, showing the interconnectedness of the Earth System 
and the effects that human activities and environmental change 
have at all scales.

Polar regions
Many of the complex changes in global environmental conditions 
tend to amplify in the polar regions. For example, heat flux from 
the lower latitudes leads to accelerating melt of sea ice as well as 
a loss of mass in Arctic glaciers and the Greenland and Antarctic 
ice sheets, all of which contribute to global sea level rise. 
There are many ways in which the polar regions affect the lower 
latitudes and the whole globe.

The Arctic
As shown in Figure 7.3, the Arctic region has experienced the 
largest increase in surface temperatures in recent decades 
(shown in red). This amplification of global warming has been 
confirmed by instrumental records and reconstruction of 
past climates, and has been demonstrated in climate model 
simulations (Serreze and Barry 2011). 

The amplification is caused by several factors including heat 
transport to the Arctic (Graversen et al. 2008); melt of sea 
ice (Screen and Simmonds 2010) enhanced by black carbon 
depositions on snow (Hansen and Nazarenko 2004) and a 
corresponding reduction in albedo; an increase in long-wave 
(infrared) energy emitted downward by the atmosphere (Francis 
and Hunter 2006); and an increase in heat-absorbing black 
carbon aerosols in the atmosphere (Chapter 2) (Shindell and 
Faluvegi 2009). The rapid shrinking of Arctic sea-ice cover is part 
of the positive climate feedback. In addition to the reduction 
in the area covered by ice over the past 30 years, as shown by 
satellite data, substantial loss is also taking place in the oldest 
and thickest ice (Maslanik et al. 2011). The disappearance of 
sea ice, which acts as a thermal insulator between the ocean 
and atmosphere, results in an enhanced upward heat flux that 
warms the lower troposphere in the Arctic, affecting the general 
atmospheric circulation in a significant part of the northern 
hemisphere (Serreze and Barry 2011; WWF 2010). This alters 
storm tracks, precipitation patterns and the conditions that 
lead to heat waves and cold spells. For example, the emerging 
atmospheric pattern of a warm Arctic Ocean and cold continents 
favours more frequent and severe Arctic air outbreaks during the 
cold season (Petoukhov and Semenov 2010), affecting the well-
being of hundreds of millions of people living in the mid-latitudes 
of the northern hemisphere.

An Earth System Perspective 199

The Arctic Council’s Snow, Water, Ice and Permafrost in the 
Arctic assessment (SWIPA 2011) shows that temperatures in the 
permafrost have risen by as much as 2oC over the past two to 
three decades, particularly at colder sites. Warming in the Arctic 
causes permafrost thaw and loss (Lawrence et al. 2008), as seen 
in the increased depth of seasonally thawing soil above the 
permafrost in Scandinavia, Arctic Russia west of the Urals, and 
inland Alaska; the 30–80 km northward retreat of the southern 
limit of permafrost in Russia between 1970 and 2005; and the 
130 km retreat in Quebec, Canada, during the past 50 years 
(ACIA 2004). A regional process of permafrost thawing supports 
increased microbial activity and is likely to lead to the release 
of carbon that is currently locked up in frozen soils (Tarnocai et 
al. 2009), initiating a global positive climate feedback (Schaefer 
et al. 2011). It is possible that by 2030 the Arctic will become a 
carbon source rather than a carbon sink (Schaefer et al. 2011). 

The warming and opening of Arctic waters also has implications 
for the accessibility of hydrocarbons and other natural resources 
(Stephenson et al. 2011). The production of oil and gas and 
increased shipping could turn the Arctic into an area of rapid 
industrial development, leading to additional anthropogenic 
emissions of carbon. This is another example of a positive 
climate feedback, involving both natural influences (the 
greenhouse effect) and social ones (human activities). 

Another unexpected manifestation of the global and regional 
links in the Earth System was observed in the Arctic in boreal 
spring 2011. An unprecedented stratospheric ozone loss 
of approximately 80 per cent at altitudes of 18–20 km was 
attributed by Manney et al. (2011) to anomalously long-lasting 
cold conditions in the Arctic’s lower stratosphere, which in turn 
led to a persistent enhancement of the atmospheric content of 
ozone-destroying forms of chlorine.

The Antarctic and the Southern Ocean
This remote region is still poorly understood and there is limited 
capacity to observe the highly complex Earth System interactions 
that take place there. Numerous observations show that Southern 
Ocean waters are warming more rapidly than the global ocean 
average. Warming of intermediate waters was reported by Gille 
(2002), while a comparison of ship and float observations showed 
widespread warming and freshening of the Antarctic Circumpolar 
Current waters (Böning et al. 2008). Abyssal and deep-water 
measurements also indicate warming trends (Purkey and Johnson 
2010). A profound peculiarity of this region is the stratospheric 
ozone hole, which has had a significant impact on the Antarctic 
environment over the last 30 years, altering the main regional 
pattern of climate variability, the Southern Annular Mode and 
associated winds, which tend to shield large parts of the continent, 
except the Antarctic Peninsula, from greenhouse-gas induced 
warming (Turner et al. 2009; Thompson and Solomon 2002).

The Antarctic is the Earth’s largest frozen store of freshwater, with 
the potential to cause sea level rise equivalent to 61.1 metres 
(IPCC 2001). While significant parts of the Antarctic ice sheet rest 
on land, these areas are still below the current mean sea level. For 

example, the ice body of the West Antarctic ice sheet is in many 
places more than 1 000 metres below the ocean surface. Recent 
estimates indicate a potential contribution to global sea level 
of 3.3 metres by this ice (Bamber et al. 2009). Recent airborne 
geophysical measurements over previously unexplored areas of 
the East Antarctic ice sheet (Young et al. 2011) have shown that it 
too is largely resting below sea level. There are therefore concerns 
about marine ice sheet stability in a rapidly warming climate. 
While recent regional temperature trends in Antarctica have not 
been very significant and in some locations negative, the Faraday/
Vernadsky Station in the northwestern part of the Antarctic 
Peninsula has observed an increase of 0.53oC per decade for the 
period 1951–2006 (Turner et al. 2009). This local warming and 
the accompanying changes in winds are considered to be the main 
causes of the collapse of the Larsen ice shelves A in 1995 and B 
in 2002. The potential destruction or accelerated melt of the West 
Antarctic ice sheet under current warming is a subject of intensive 
research (Huybrechts 2009; Pollard and DeConto 2009). 

As a general rule, when atmospheric concentrations of CO2 increase, 
the oceans tend to absorb more of it. However, in the Southern 
Ocean, which represents a significant fraction of the global ocean 
carbon sink (Takahashi et al. 2009), there is a declining ability 
to absorb CO2 (Le Quéré et al. 2007). One of the likely reasons 
for this is a 15–20 per cent intensification of the circumpolar 
westerly winds over the Southern Ocean since the 1970s, which 
can be partially attributed to the effects of the stratospheric 
ozone hole (Thompson and Solomon 2002). This phenomenon 
also has important implications for Antarctic biodiversity (Box 7.3).

Box 7.3 Antarctic biodiversity

The Antarctic Large Marine Ecosystem is characterized by a 
rather short food web linking phytoplankton at lower trophic 
levels to Antarctic krill, on which fish, squid, baleen whales, 
seals, penguins and seabirds all feed (Hill et al. 2006). There 
was uncontrolled, or poorly regulated, harvesting of seals, 
whales and fish in the period up until the 1980s (Sherman 
and Hempel 2008). Seals, whales and seabirds were the initial 
targets of harvesting, but as stocks of these were depleted 
attention moved to fish, then krill, and finally to crabs and 
squid. Because much of the earlier exploitation happened 
rather rapidly and resulted in a series of catastrophic stock 
collapses of key organisms, there must have been severe 
ecological consequences (Nicol and Robertson 2006). A 
precautionary approach to the management of the krill 
fishery was adopted by the Convention for the Conservation 
of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), which came 
into force in 1982, as an interim measure during development 
of its preferred approach, which includes enhancement of 
ecosystem monitoring; further evolution of models linking 
krill, their predators, environmental influences and the 
fishery; and high-resolution, real-time information about the 
behaviour of fishing vessels (Hewitt et al. 2001).

Part 1: State and Trends

The ensemble of climate-chemistry models of the World Climate 
Research Programme Chemistry-Climate Model Validation project 
(CCMVal2) indicates that complete recovery of the stratospheric 
ozone layer resulting from implementation of the Montreal 
Protocol should occur around the middle of this century (Eyring 
et al. 2010). However, the ozone layer restoration may affect the 
Southern Annual Mode and associated winds, weakening the 
currently existing restraint on greenhouse gas-induced warming 
in Antarctica and the Southern Ocean (Turner et al. 2009), and 
potentially leading to other significant local-to-global changes. 

Implications for human well-being
The patterns of change in the polar regions and their links with 
activities and impacts elsewhere on the globe illustrate the 
archetypical pattern of vulnerability described in GEO-4 (UNEP 
2007) as “misusing the global commons”. This misuse leads 
to the exposure of people and the environment to resource 
depletion, for example dwindling fisheries or land in the case 
of sea level rise, and to environmental transformations such as 
climate change and sea level rise. Those who are most vulnerable 
to changes resulting from misuse of the global commons are 
usually not responsible for the misuse itself. 

From an Earth System perspective, the ongoing and potential 
future changes of the polar regions – given the sometimes long 
timescales, the interconnections with the rest of the globe, the 
interactions between problem areas like stratospheric ozone 
recovery and global warming, and possible catastrophic events 
such as the melting of the West Antarctic ice sheet – point to the 
need for holistic responses to managing the global commons in 
order to reduce the vulnerability of people and the environment 
to potentially very large pressures.

The Hindu Kush-Himalaya
The Hindu Kush-Himalaya (Figure 7.4), sometimes referred 
to as the Third Pole, is one of the most dynamic and complex 
mountain systems in the world. It contains the largest amount 
of snow and ice found outside the polar regions, including more 
than 100 000 km2 of glacier cover, and the sources of ten of the 
largest rivers in Asia. This mountain system, stretching 3 500 km 
through some of the world’s wettest and driest environments, 
rising 8 km vertically through nearly every life zone existing on 
Earth, and at the geographical centre of the largest and densest 
concentration of humans, is recognized as an extremely fragile 
environment and particularly vulnerable to global warming 
(Bates et al. 2008; Xu et al. 2007). 

Extreme vulnerability to natural hazards in the countries of 
South Asia is cyclical and repeatedly causes major setbacks in 
the socio-economic and equitable development of the region. 
Climate change is expected to increase both the frequency and 
magnitude of extreme weather events that lead to disasters, and 
calls for speedy action (Cruz et al. 2007).

and powerfully changing the ecological and socio-economic 
landscape in the Himalayan region. This is particularly true 
in relation to water and ecosystem services, with significant 
implications for mountain communities and livelihoods, as 
well as downstream users, especially women who, for instance, 
often need to trek longer distances for potable water and fuel 
(UNEP 2011b). In mountain areas, however, the influence of the 
changing climate has to be understood in the frame of overall 
changes due to modernization – communication, transport, 
infrastructure, monetization and others – and migration (CIDA 
2002), which alters traditional gender relations. 

Implications for human well-being
Climate change impacts in the Hindu Kush-Himalaya region and 
downstream are particularly severe due to the large number 
of people depending on climate-sensitive livelihoods such as 
agriculture. Here, more than 20 per cent live below the poverty 
line, amounting to around 260 million people. The International 
Food Policy Research Institute concluded that the negative 
impact of climate change on world cereal production may vary 
from 0.6 per cent to 0.9 per cent per year, but that in South Asia 
the impact could be as high as 18.2–22.1 per cent by 2080 (von 
Braun 2007). Recent studies conclude that the Himalayan region 
and its downstream areas, including the Indo-Gangetic plains,

Himalayas combined with the precariousness of many homesteads 
on low incomes, makes the region a particularly flood-sensitive 
area, with mudslides and unstable ground (Figure 7.4) serious 
threats to settlement areas. Moreover, the risks of death and 
destruction are increased by the fact that people, after floods, 
often rebuild on the same risk-prone areas. 

Mountain livelihoods are much more susceptible to 
environmental and economic upheaval than are livelihoods in the 
plains, and poverty in the mountains is exacerbated by climate 
change (ICIMOD 2010b). Women, in particular, are vulnerable to 
the impacts of climate change and environmental degradation 
(ICIMOD 2009; Plümper and Neemayer 2007). 

The Amazon
The Amazon forest is an extremely important component of 
the Earth System. It is the repository of the greatest terrestrial 
diversity of organisms on Earth (Cochrane and Barber 2009; Foley 
et al. 2007), it exchanges vast amounts of water and energy with 
the atmosphere and thus affects local and regional climates (da 
Rocha et al. 2009), and it is a major carbon sink and reservoir 
containing 90 billion tonnes of carbon (Chao et al. 2009). This is 
about a fifth of the total carbon contained in the world’s tropical 
forests (Pan et al. 2011; Chao et al. 2009). 

The Amazon has recently experienced two once-in-a-century 
droughts in the space of five years – 2005 and 2010. Both

events caused rapid, widespread tree mortality leading to large 
increases in carbon emissions in undisturbed regions that are 
normally net carbon sinks (Lewis et al. 2011; Phillips et al. 2009). 
Even under declining deforestation rates, droughts increase 
vulnerability to fires by enhancing forest flammability and fire 
spread (Aragão et al. 2007). According to model simulations 
by Vergara and Scholz (2010), in a zero-deforestation scenario 
the effect of climate change alone, which is predominantly 
driven by fossil-fuel emissions, could reduce the extent of the 
Amazon biome by one-third by 2100. But when the effects 
of deforestation and fire are combined with those of climate 
change, the models show a much greater reduction. 

Deforestation in general, and in the Amazon in particular, is a 
product of the interactions of multiple socio-economic factors 
(Chapter 3) in addition to the natural factors discussed above. 
The largest of these by far is conversion to cattle pasture to 
satisfy growing international demand for beef (Zaks et al. 
2009). As discussed in Chapter 3, there remains a basis for 
optimism regarding the future of the Amazon. For example, 
Brazil’s governmental Action Plan for Prevention and Control 
of Deforestation in the Amazon (PPCDAm) coordinates a set 
of government initiatives focused on three goals: monitoring 
and law enforcement, land tenure regularization, and fostering 
alternatives for sustainable land use. 

Implications for human well-being
In addition to its importance in regulating the global climate 
through acting as a carbon sink, the Amazon also provides 
livelihoods for both indigenous peoples and recent settlers 
(Parry 2008). Foley et al. (2007) note that the Amazon system 
regulates freshwater and river flows, modulates regional climate 
patterns and controls the spread of vector-borne and water-borne 
diseases, all of which are crucial to human well-being. Farmers 
in the Amazon are vulnerable to climate change through the 
effects of drought, flood and fire on planting times, the spread 
of disease, and impacts on food, water and human security 
(Brondizio and Moran 2008). 

Drylands 
Desertification or land degradation in drylands is one of the 
greatest environmental challenges facing human society 
(Chapter 3). The world’s drylands – arid, semi-arid and dry 
sub-humid climatic regions, ranging from deserts to steppes 
and savannahs – cover approximately 40 per cent of the world’s 
land surface area and are home to nearly 2 billion people 
(Ezcurra 2006). Degradation of a landscape is a particularly 
complex problem because it involves a tight coupling of socio-
economic, meteorological and ecological processes (Reynolds 
and Stafford Smith 2002). 

Western Australia
One example of how changes in land cover can affect the 
regional climate in an arid zone is the rabbit-proof fence in 
Western Australia, built to prevent rabbits from damaging 
cropland and pastures. The fence spans more than 750 km 
and separates native vegetation to the east from 13 million 

Western Australia’s rabbit-proof fence separates native vegetation 
(east) from farmland and pastures (west). There are more clouds on 
the darker eastern side of the fence where native vegetation grows.

hectares of cropland to the west. It did little to protect the 
crops from rabbits, but it illustrates how vegetation affects 
climate: there are more clouds and it rains more frequently 
on the east side of the fence where native vegetation remains 
(see photo). Several plausible explanations are provided by 
Nair et al. (2011), who measured numerous physical and 
biological variables on both sides of the fence. They found 
that these variables differed substantially throughout the 
year on the agricultural side of the fence whereas only small 
seasonal variations were found over the native vegetation. Nair 
and colleagues concluded that the darker surface and greater 
roughness of the native vegetation resulted in an enhanced 
heat flux into the atmosphere, which increases the chances 
of cloud formation. Since measurements began in the 1970s, 
rainfall observations show about a 20 per cent decline in winter 
rainfall, confined mainly to agricultural areas. 

The Sahel 
The Sahel is a large semi-arid region that runs east-west across 
Africa south of the Sahara, and extends through ten countries. 
Rainfall is extremely variable and predominantly driven by two 
major, and undoubtedly interacting, factors: patterns in global 
sea surface temperature (Biasutti et al. 2008) and large-scale 
changes in land cover that impact land-atmosphere interactions 
(Huber et al. 2011). The role of rainfall variability and vegetation 
dynamics in the Sahel has been the subject of many high-profile 
studies, and is particularly important because the population of 
Sahelian countries is projected to quadruple by 2020 relative to 
its population of 19 million in 1960 (Brown and Crawford 2009). 

An Earth System Perspective 203

Almost 6 000 years ago the Sahel was covered by grasslands and 
shrublands (Prentice and Jolly 2000; Hoelzmann et al. 1998), 
with records of marine sediments and archaeological evidence 
showing a switch to arid conditions thereafter (Foley et al. 2003; 
de Menocal et al. 2000). More recently, there has been a marked 
shift from relatively wetter conditions with higher rainfall in the 
1950s and 1960s to drier conditions in the 1970s and 1980s, 
followed by a general trend in increasing precipitation throughout 
the Sahelian region over the past 30 years (Huber et al. 2011), 
leading to what is generally referred to as a greening trend. 
Huber et al. (2011), however, demonstrate the complexity of this 
trend, since vegetation changes are not always directly related to 
precipitation changes. 

Implications for human well-being
In the case of Western Australia, land-use change brought 
unintended consequences. As well as the decrease in rainfall, the 
removal of deep-rooted native vegetation also led to a rise in the 
water table, increasing the surface salinity of the farmland and, 
hence, further decreasing agricultural productivity. As humans 
continue to clear land for agriculture a paradox is in the making: 
while food production may increase in the short run, it may be 
seriously decreased in the long run (Noticewala 2007).

Another consequence of the widespread clearance of native 
vegetation in Australia for cattle raising and farming was its 
impact on indigenous peoples who had relied on previously 
abundant wildlife for their traditional diets. Many groups 
had little choice but to work on cattle stations and adapt to 
European foods (Kouris-Blazos and Wahlqvist 2000). This has 
had a detrimental impact on their nutritional status and well-
being, leading to chronic diseases associated with obesity 
(Wolfenden et al. 2011).

Subsistence agriculture is the main source of household 
livelihoods in many parts of Africa, especially in dryland regions 
such as the Sahel (Kumssa and Jones 2010). This constitutes a 
serious food security risk given the complex feedbacks between 
human activities, land cover and climate. The African Partnership 
Forum (APF 2007) estimates that 75–250 million people living in 
the African drylands will be affected by climate change.

Although a greening of the Sahel region is observed, rainfall in the 
Western part of the region has not increased (Huber et al. 2011). A 
study by Mertz et al. (2010) of 1 249 households in five Sahelian 
countries with annual rainfall ranging from 400 to 900 mm, found 
that climate factors, mainly inadequate rainfall, are believed by 
30–50 per cent of households to be a cause of decreasing rain-fed 
crop production, whereas a wide range of other factors, such as 
changes of land tenure, was held responsible for the remaining 
50–70 per cent. The differences between the rain-fed crop and 
livestock sectors, as well as between the driest and wettest zones 
studied by Mertz et al. (2010), illustrate the difficulty faced by 
people on the agricultural margins in the driest part of the Sahel 
who are trying to develop their rain-fed agriculture. Adaptation to 
climate change in the drylands will have to take these complex 
interactions into account.

Fires
The majority of global biomass burning occurs in the tropics where 
there are cycles of drought and exceptionally wet years (Liu et al. 
2010; van der Werf et al. 2008; Goldammer and de Ronde 2004). 
The African continent has the highest occurrence of vegetation 
fires, accounting for an estimated 30–50 per cent of the total 
annual biomass burned globally (Roberts and Wooster 2008; 
Dwyer et al. 2000). 

Large and uncontrolled fires have increased in the recent past 
on all vegetated continents and have caused tens of billions 
of US dollars of damage (Bowman et al. 2009). Evidence from 
the United States and from Canada (Figure 7.5) shows that fire 
extent in both countries increased significantly over the 20th 
century. In the western United States, the frequency of large 
fires has increased nearly fourfold and the extent more than 
sixfold since the mid-1980s (USGCRP 2009). Recent fires in the 
Canadian and Alaskan tundra are unprecedented in the last 
5 000 years (Hessl 2011). Satellite observations demonstrate 
a strongly non-linear relationship between climate and human 
activity: droughts result in more rapid deforestation while 
also reducing the fire buffering effect of peatland water tables, 
thereby increasing ecosystem vulnerability to fire (van der 
Werf et al. 2008). Projecting future fire dynamics is challenging 
because of the non-linearities in the various causal factors 
(Hessl 2011; Flannigan et al. 2009; van der Werf et al. 2008) 
and the unresolved question of whether direct human activity 
or climate change plays a more dominant role in general 
(Bowman et al. 2009). 

Implications for human well-being
Among the significant effects of fires on human well-being are 
the destruction of assets such as homes (Bowman et al. 2009); 
effects on human health and mortality, as demonstrated by 
the fires in Russia in 2010; and the lost livelihoods of rural 
resource-dependent communities, as experienced, for example, 
in Lebanon in 2007 (IUCN 2008). In addition, the continuation 
or exacerbation of current global fire trends would have serious

consequences for the enormous amounts of carbon stored 
in forests and other ecosystems, potentially unleashing an 
amplifying climate-carbon feedback and increasing the risk of 
dangerous climate change. 

Shale gas basins 
New proven technologies such as directional drilling and 
hydraulic fracturing have made the extraction of natural gas 
from low permeability geologic formations (shale formations) 
economically viable. These practices have accelerated the 
construction of new natural gas wells and their accompanying 
infrastructure – pipelines, roads, compressor stations and 
evaporation ponds – and led to extensive land fragmentation 
and disturbance, degraded air quality, and degraded surface- 
and groundwater quality. In parts of both the eastern and 
western United States, there has been rapid growth in the pace 
of development as new geologic targets become economical 
to drill using new technologies. Although to date such shale 
gas extraction has primarily taken place in the United States, 
it is expected to reach other parts of the world (Figure 7.6) as 
use of the new technology expands, and as changing access, 
profitability compared to other gas resources, and shale gas 
characteristics make it viable (Kuuskraa and Stevens 2009). 

While substituting the burning of coal with natural gas leads to 
emission reductions and may have some local air quality benefits 
(Howarth et al. 2011), the impacts on air quality near concentrated 
natural gas development can be quite severe due to the release of 
hazardous air pollutants such as benzene, ozone-forming precursors 
and fugitive dust, among others. More broadly, such fuel switching, 
along with the continuing large-scale development and use of 
unconventional fossil fuels like shale gas, is likely to exacerbate 
human-induced climate change because the methane emissions 
are at least 30 per cent higher than from conventional gas (Howarth 
et al. 2011; Wigley 2011). Furthermore, evaporation ponds used for

The impacts of natural gas development on water resources are 
also broad-ranging, including the contamination of groundwater 
aquifers with potentially explosive levels of methane (Osborn 
et al. 
and organic compounds, and of streams where produced water 
is discharged (Johnson et al. 
consumptive water use for the drilling and completion of wells. 
The complex nature of many of the geologic formations from 
which natural gas is recovered may lead to many unknown 
impacts on groundwater resources. This is of particular concern 
because of the huge volume of shale gas deposits worldwide (EIA

for global sustainability complement previous concepts such 
as limits to growth, carrying capacity, ecological footprint and 
overshoot, which have in common an estimate of stocks of natural 
resources and critical loads of different pollutants predominantly 
in relation to health. Underlying all of these descriptors are 
different methods and assumptions for identifying points at which 
the ability of the Earth System to absorb anthropogenic changes 
is exceeded. While these methods and assumptions are still being 
discussed in the scientific literature, their conclusions all point 
in the same direction: thresholds in the Earth System are being 
reached and the consequences are significant.

Forty years ago, Meadows et al. (1972) argued in The Limits to 
Growth that unchecked consumption and economic growth on 
a finite planet were leading the Earth towards overshoot of its 
carrying capacity, which would be followed by major impacts 
on the global economy. Hall and Day (2009) looked back at 
the conclusions of this study and found that its warnings were 
generally correct. Turner (2008) compared historical data for 
1970–2000 with scenarios presented in The Limits to Growth and 
found that 30 years of historical data compared favourably with 
key features of the business-as-usual scenario, which results in 
collapse of the global system midway through the 21st century.

The ecological footprint (Chapter 5) is used to understand human 
demand on the biosphere and the Earth’s biocapacity. While 
there is still a need for improved data, humanity’s ecological 
footprint overall has doubled since 1966, with major regional 
disparities (WWF 2010). Box 7.4 and Figure 7.7 show the 
significant regional differences in both footprint and available 
biocapacity, indicating which regions use more biocapacity 
than is available. Of significance with regard to overshoot is the 
ecological footprint of megacities.

Another approach that points to Earth System limits looks at 
resource use (UNEP 2011a). Material flow accounting, which 
quantifies all materials used in economic activities, accounts for 
the total material mobilized during extraction and for the materials 
actually used in economic processes measured in terms of their 
mass (tonnes). At the beginning of the 21st century, estimates 
of the quantity of global raw materials extracted ranged between 
47 and 59 billion tonnes per year (Figure 7.8 shows the higher 
estimates), with global annual material extraction having increased 
by a factor of eight during the 20th century (UNEP 2011a). Three 
scenarios developed by UNEP (2011a) all demonstrate that without 
significant improvements in resource productivity, it will not be 
possible to meet the needs of 9 billion people by 2050. 

Recognizing interactions and non-linear dynamics within 
the Earth System, the concept of planetary boundaries was 
introduced by Rockström et al. (2009a) to identify those 
key environmental processes that provide humanity with 
a safe operating space for well-being. Rockström et al. 
(2009b) identified nine planetary processes and proposed 
safe boundaries for seven of them – climate change, rate 
of biodiversity loss, the nitrogen and phosphorous cycle, 
stratospheric ozone depletion, ocean acidification, global 
freshwater use and change in land use. The proposed boundary 
position was placed at what was considered to be a safe distance 
from the risk of critical feedbacks and non-linear shifts that could 
trigger deleterious changes in critical environmental systems 
(Figure 7.9). The safe position for a process was based on an 
assessment of the current state of science, acknowledging that 
there is and will always be an uncertainty range for environmental 
risks. The safe boundary level for each environmental process 
was selected for the lower end of this scientific uncertainty range 
to reflect a precautionary approach (Rockström et al. 2009a,

2009b). The boundaries relate to rates and processes driven by 
human activities and not to resource scarcities. 

The planetary boundaries framework indicates that 
environmental challenges at the global scale go well beyond 
climate change. Furthermore, evidence indicates that the 
processes analysed interact: transgressing one safe boundary 
may affect the distance from others. For example, expanding 
agricultural land may undermine the climate change boundary by 
increasing carbon emissions from terrestrial ecosystems. While 
the specific numbers used in the planetary boundaries analysis 
may be challenged (Nature 2009), the approach provides input 
to the debate about overshoot: early analyses indicate that 
humanity has already transgressed three boundaries – climate 
change, the rate of biodiversity loss, and global interference with 
the nitrogen cycle (Rockstrom et al. 2009b). A recent follow-up 
on human interference with the phosphorous cycle indicates that 
the phosphorous boundary has also been exceeded in freshwater 
systems (Carpenter and Bennett 2011). 

Implications for human well-being 
Ecosystems are essential for human well-being through their 
provisioning, regulating, supporting and cultural services (TEEB 
2010; MA 2005). Human well-being refers to the extent to which 
individuals have the ability to live the kind of lives they value 
and the opportunities to achieve their potential (UNEP 2007), 
and is determined by a range of factors including access to 
resources, not just financial ones, security, good health and 
social relations (Introduction). All of these factors are affected 

208

Part 1: State and Trends

by changes in the Earth System. Global interconnectedness in 
the human-environment system also means that well-being in 
one place may be affected by practices elsewhere. Chapters 
2–6 provide examples of how changes in subsystems of the 
Earth System affect well-being, although they generally refer 
to aspects such as food and water security rather than assets, 
social cohesion and personal security. 

From an Earth System perspective, it is important to consider the 
consequences for human well-being of exceeding the planet’s 
carrying capacity or entering periods of abrupt and irreversible 
change. As shown in the examples below, the impacts of 
complex, non-linear changes in the Earth System are already 
having serious consequences for human well-being. 
 
Multiple and interacting drivers affect human security
Climate variability and extreme weather influence food security. 
These drivers are complex and involve different pathways 
(regional water scarcity, salinization of agricultural lands, 
destruction of crops through flood events, disruption of food 
logistics through disasters, and increased burden of infectious 
plant diseases or pests) (IPCC 2007). 

Crossing thresholds: significant health impacts
Land-use change and deforestation alter habitats by raising local 
temperatures and removing shade, changes that can facilitate 
the rapid development of malaria vectors (da Silva-Nunes et al. 
2008; Afrane et al. 2005). Pascual et al. (2006) demonstrated 
the importance of the well-recognized non-linear and threshold 
responses of malaria (a biological system) to the effect of 
regional temperature change. 

Unprecedented events affect assets and human security
Climate change already undermines human security and will 
do so increasingly in the future, by reducing access to, and 
the quality of, natural resources that are important to sustain 
livelihoods (Barnett and Adger 2007). In Bangladesh, for 
example, a significant number of people are affected every year 
by riverbank erosion and floods that lead to loss of agricultural 
land, infrastructure and communication systems. These assets 
are essential for maintaining livelihoods (Poncelet et al. 2010).

Rapid change and indigenous communities
As discussed, the Arctic is warming faster than elsewhere on the 
planet. Since 1975, temperatures in Alaska have increased by 
an average of 2.0–3.5oC. Approximately 200 indigenous villages 
along the navigable waters of Alaska’s coasts and rivers are 
threatened by accelerated rates of erosion or flooding, and five 
communities have concluded that relocation is the only solution. 
Studies show that displacement has considerable cultural, 
social, economic and psychological impacts (Bronen 2010).

TRANSITIONS AND SYSTEMIC RESPONSES TO EARTH 
SYSTEM CHALLENGES
Earth System challenges have been characterized as “persistent 
problems of unsustainability” that are “… complex, ill-structured, 
involve many stakeholders, are surrounded by structural 

uncertainties, and are hard to manage” (Rotmans 2006). 
Persistent problems tend to reappear when only their symptoms 
are treated or when the measures taken are only marginal and 
incremental, and thus inadequate to deal with root causes. For 
each of the different issues discussed in Chapters 2–6 – climate 
change, land degradation, biodiversity loss, water security and 
chemical pollution – symptoms of unsustainability mask deeper 
underlying problems in societal structures and institutions.

The persistence of the problems is due to what Rotmans (2006) 
refers to as system failures: 
•	 institutional	system	failures	–	a	predominance	of	institutions	

that block innovation; 

•	 economic	system	failures	–	inadequate	market	development	

or lack of investment capital;

Transition management 
Addressing these system failures requires new, innovative 
forms of governance, including transition management (Chapter 
16) (Grin et al. 2010). Ultimately, ignoring these systemic 
failures will result in non-linear, systemic and fundamental 
changes in the composition and functioning of the societal 
system, with changes in structures, cultures and practices 
(Loorbach and Rotmans 2010). 

Transitional change is different from normal or gradual societal 
change, as shown in Figure 7.10, and occurs in four phases: 
pre-development, take-off, acceleration and stabilization. 
Between the pre-development and acceleration phases, a

moment of take-off is often recognized, tipping the system over 
a point of no return (Frantzeskaki and de Haan 2009). 

Historical transitions, such as the post-1950 emergence of personal 
mobility, intensive agriculture or fossil energy infrastructure, were 
partly driven by the promise of solving societal problems such as 
poverty, inequality, lack of education and so on. However, these 
transitions have, in turn, produced their own problems. While 
individuals might now have access to cheap energy and mobility, 
the results are pollution, resource exploitation and congestion. 
The challenge in dealing with complex and persistent modern 
problems is to find new ways of dealing with them in a more 
anticipatory and exploratory manner. It is necessary to improve 
understanding of the dynamics of complex processes of change 
and try to influence their pace and direction. 

A more thorough understanding of the forces that drive societal 
transitions is essential in policy making for the Earth System 
(Frantzeskaki and de Haan 2009). While current mainstream 
policy and research approaches predominantly seek to improve 
existing systems, leading to gradual improvement, transitions 
thinking requires a fundamental shift. The current trend of 
marginal improvements and optimization of existing systems 
leads to lock-ins not only in technological systems but also 
in policy and consequently social systems (Frantzeskaki and 
Loorbach 2010) that divert society from sustainability. Escaping 
such lock-ins requires radical shifts – transformative changes 
(Chapters 16 and 17) – that fundamentally alter structures, 
cultures and practices to achieve sustainability in the long term. 

As transitions are increasingly likely to occur given the 
instabilities in both socio-economic and ecological systems, 
it is crucial that strategies be developed to influence these 
transitions effectively in terms of their speed and direction 
(Loorbach et al. 2011; Loorbach and Rotmans 2006). While 
steering a transition in a command-and-control manner is not 
workable, it is possible to influence a transition by using various 
approaches, including coordinating existing social movements, 
niche-innovations and new practices in general. The importance

Box 7.5 Innovative response to a crisis

In Chile, a combination of fisheries collapse and the move 
to democracy provided the opportunity to try some new 
arrangements for managing fisheries based on informal 
partnerships and trust between fishers, scientists and 
managers. There was a general recognition that Chile’s 
fish stocks were in trouble and people were looking for 
answers, while at the same time societal change had begun. 
This supported openness to new approaches. Scientific 
understanding of coastal ecosystems in the region was good 
and provided the basis for a new management plan and the 
testing of new cooperative models for fishery management. 
The result was a national system of marine tenure that 
allocates exclusive ocean territories to local and small-scale 
fisheries. By cutting the number of large vessels in distinct 
territories, fishing pressure was reduced.

of long-term stable and systemic monitoring for managing 
transitions is illustrated by the example in Box 7.5.

Understanding the inevitability of transitions, and learning to 
govern and manage transition processes, is particularly important 
given the evidence of Earth System changes (Loorbach et al. 
2011). New kinds of multi-level change processes are required 
that involve a dynamic interplay between gradually introduced, 
top-down changes and self-organizing bottom-up processes of 
social innovation, because traditional expert-driven, top-down 

Box 7.6 The transition to improved governance of 
the Great Barrier Reef

Olsson et al. (2008) found that in the case of the Great 
Barrier Reef, management had to be flexible, adaptive 
and responsive to continual scientific monitoring. This 
flexibility enabled new interactions and ways of working, with 
leadership and consensus building also being important. The 
Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority and its Chair played 
an essential role in seeking and obtaining the support of the 
public, industry and governments at all levels for putting the 
management of the world’s largest coral reef system on to an 
ecological footing. A critical step in the process was to enlist 
public support for managing the reef more flexibly. One of 
the most visible and controversial initiatives under the new 
regime was to extend the area closed to all forms of fishing 
from 6 per cent to 33 per cent of the total reef area, creating 
the largest no-take zone in the world. The Barrier Reef 
example illustrates a shift in thinking towards an integrated 
view of humans and nature based on active stewardship of 
marine ecosystems for human well-being.

approaches to problem solving are not flexible enough to address 
complex, non-linear and rapidly changing situations effectively. 

These change processes require the active involvement of 
agents from science, policy, civil society and business, both 
in the development of new knowledge and in its application 
(O’Riordan 2008). The processes are necessarily iterative and 
involve developing a joint framing of a problem, a shared vision 
of the future, experimenting with solutions, evaluation and 
learning. Bottom-up solutions developed in this way should 
contribute to improving local sustainability and also reinforce 
the initial top-down changes and support their further extension 
(Weaver 2011). This is also proposed by the German Advisory 
Council on Global Change (WBGU 2011), which points to the 
need to empower the state to determine priorities and underline 
them with clear signals, while at the same time giving citizens 
more extensive opportunities to have a voice, to get involved in 
decision making and to take a more active role in politics. 

With regard to bottom-up responses, Westley et al. (2011) point out 
that there are enormous reservoirs for learning and innovation that 
are often revealed in moments of crisis. Success involves listening 
to local communities for ideas, informing local populations of the 
resources and possibilities available, trusting them and allowing 
a diversity of innovative responses to emerge, as opposed to 
insisting on a top-down planning process. One of the examples 
cited by Westley et al. (2011) is summarized in Box 7.6. 

REFLECTIONS
The Earth System is complex, with many interactions between and 
within subsystems, feedbacks and non-linearity. Humans, as an 
integral part of the Earth System, are changing it through their sheer 
numbers and their activities, although the impacts of these changes 
are not uniformly distributed, with some people and places more 
affected than others. As a result of the enormous complexity of the 
system as a whole, it is not possible to predict the outcomes of 
rapidly increasing human pressures on the Earth System, but it is 
clear that thresholds have been or are being reached, beyond which 
abrupt and irreversible changes occur. These changes will affect the 
basic life-support functions of the planet. 

While efforts have been made to address some of the changes, 
and there are some success stories documented elsewhere in 
this report, this analysis points to the need for approaches that 
address the underlying drivers of anthropogenic pressures on the 
Earth System, especially population growth and overconsumption. 
At the same time, it is necessary to adopt approaches that can 
deal better with the complexities and inherent uncertainties of the 
Earth System. Such approaches are discussed in Chapters 15 and 
16 as adaptive governance processes. These must, however, be 
underpinned by sustained long-term monitoring and observation 
of all relevant aspects of the system, regular evaluation of 
progress, and adjustment of goals when observations indicate 
that this is necessary. At the same time, basic and applied 
research must continue to improve understanding of the Earth 
System and make this knowledge available in the search for 
solutions to persistent problems of unsustainability.

Main Messages 

Global research programmes and rapidly
improving technologies for collecting 
environmental information and presenting it in 
engaging ways are informing the debate about 
present and future environmental challenges. 
Nevertheless, deficiencies in scientifically credible 
data on the environment – in particular time series 
on such issues as freshwater quantity and quality, 
groundwater depletion, ecosystem services, loss  
of natural habitat, land degradation, and chemicals 
and waste – are a major handicap in developing 
evidence-based policies.

Official environment statistics is still an emerging 
field, with poor availability and quality of data in 
many countries. Environment statistics, mostly 
collected or compiled by national statistical offices, 
are one of the most important sources of information 
for assessment reports like GEO-5, but global and 
regional reports from the United Nations and other 
agencies regularly show gaps, or use old data or 
estimates.

Capacity development to support environmental 
information, especially in developing countries, 
needs to be stepped up significantly. Different 
countries often use different approaches to produce 
data on the same issue, making comparisons 
difficult. This highlights the need for regular 
monitoring and, to allow comparisons across nations 

and regions, the harmonization of approaches to 
those that follow international standards. Also 
of high priority are the coordination at country 
level of existing – if fragmented – scientific and 
environmental data; the provision of easy access to a 
range of potential users, for example on the internet; 
and linking this data with official statistics that are 
used for policy making.

International cooperation is essential, since 
environmental problems do not follow national 
boundaries. Some of the many global and regional 
initiatives supporting environmental information 
are mentioned in this review. International 
cooperation and sharing of comparable data are 
especially important in addressing global issues 
such as climate change, and tackling environmental 
problems related to transboundary watercourses, 
oceans and seas, and polar regions. At present, 
cooperation mechanisms are much stronger in some 
areas than others.
 
Adequate information does exist to develop 
effective environmental policies; data gaps rarely 
justify inaction. However, more systematic data 
collection efforts can help governments to assess 
their progress towards international goals, improve 
the focus of their policies and monitor their impact, 
and direct scarce resources to address the most 
critical environmental challenges.

BACKGROUND 
This review provides a snapshot of the data on which GEO-5 
is based, highlights some of the limitations in the data that 
are currently available, describes some global and regional 
programmes that are supporting environmental information, 
and identifies some of the highest priorities for promoting more 
effective environmental monitoring in countries and regions. 

The review is intended to have a practical, rather than a 
detailed, technical focus. In line with the request of the Global 
Intergovernmental and Multi-Stakeholder Consultation, it focuses 
on data relevant to track the state and trends of the environment 
(Part 1), and touches more briefly on data needs relating to policy 
responses (Parts 2 and 3). 

DEFINITIONS
Data: “facts and statistics used for reference or analysis” (COD 
2003). Data is used here to mean points of information, normally 
collected through some kind of scientific method. An example of 
a point of data or “datum” is a measurement of the temperature 
in downtown Cairo at 8:00am. 

Datasets: collections of data on a particular issue, for example 
historical temperature records for downtown Cairo.

Information: “facts or knowledge provided or learned as a result 
of research or study” (COD 2003). Information is used here as a 
broader term, including facts, data, anecdotes and the results 
of analysis that are understood, correctly or incorrectly, by the 
person using them; for example, the best time to visit Cairo is in 
the cooler months between November and March.

Statistics: is used here to describe official data collected by 
national statistical offices. 

Environment statistics: statistics that describe the state of and 
trends in the environment, covering the media of the natural 
environment (air and climate, water, land and soil), the biota 
within the media and human settlements (OECD 2007).

INTRODUCTION
The factual and scientific quality of an assessment such as GEO-5 
relies to a large extent on what data are available on the state 
and trends of the environment. Economic and social data are 
important to analyse the drivers and socio-economic impacts of 
environmental change (Box 8.1) and consider possible responses 
and scenarios. Indices, obtained by combining and packaging 
data on a number of variables, can be used to summarize 
information and make it easier to communicate and understand, 
and a variety of other tools can be used to visualize, present and 
disseminate data and information.

Box 8.1 The three principal data gaps on drivers of 
global environmental change

Human migration
Data are needed on where migrants come from and where they 
go, with respect to both international migration and internal 
migration, and also regarding both permanent and temporary 
migration. Data would ideally include timing, numbers and 
geographic locations.

Agricultural systems
Basic information is needed on inflows and outflows of 
nutrients and water, as well as other important resource flows.

Environmental footprints for economic production
At the level of country and product, information is needed on 
energy and water inputs and key pollution outputs in order 
to understand how patterns of production and consumption 
affect environmental systems.

measurements or time series; analysis of data to produce 
information that policy makers can use, such as comparisons of 
trends over time or progress towards established targets; and the 
interpretation of results to explain patterns and trends. Existing 
gaps and capacity-building needs relate to all these areas. 

Rapid advances in information technology, remote sensing, 
geographic information systems (GIS), global positioning 
systems (GPS), database management, measuring instruments, 
data visualization tools, social media and the internet offer 
unprecedented opportunities to collect and disseminate 
information. The trend towards digital data has opened up new 
possibilities for state-of-the-environment reporting, allowing 
users to directly access and download data, maps and other 
information, in addition to the more traditional periodic, 
analytical reports such as GEO. That said, many national 
statistical offices have not yet been able to exploit this potential 
to modernize their statistical systems, an area that could benefit 
from international coordination and support.

Internationally comparable data are necessary to track 
environmental changes at the regional and global level. 
Most data to track the state and trends of the environment 
are collected at the country level, but both availability and 
quality remain poor in a large number of countries. Many do 
not produce internationally comparable data because they 
follow their own national guidelines or a modified version of 
international guidelines. 

The availability of information relies on activities such as data 
collection, for example measurements of pollution levels in air 
and water, sea surface temperature, or images from satellite 
remote sensing that can be used to produce land-cover 
maps; monitoring programmes involving regular, comparable 

Data are produced by a wide range of public and private sources 
but these are often scattered and difficult to compare globally. In 
addition, privately produced data may be protected by intellectual 
property rights and available only at cost; although in the absence 
of property rights, data may not have been collected at all.

Review of Data Needs 217

In 2009, the United Nations reported: “Environment statistics 
frequently lack one or more of the standard attributes of high-
quality statistics, namely, relevance, accuracy, timeliness, 
accessibility, interpretability and coherence. The fact that 
environment statistics are ad hoc, widely dispersed and of 
varying degrees of quality clearly underlines the need for 
a framework, that is, a basic organizing structure to guide 
environment statistics (UN 2009).”

INTERNATIONAL PROGRAMMES SUPPORTING 
ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATION
A number of international programmes support data collection 
and analysis, and coordinate, compile, disseminate and present 
data and information on various issues relating to the state of the 
environment. It is important to note that environmental data and 
information from UN sources often rely on statistics collected by 
national governments.

The United Nations has developed a core set of Indicators of 
Sustainable Development in response to the 2002 World Summit 
on Sustainable Development (WSSD) and decisions of the UN 
Commission on Sustainable Development (CSD). The latest 
revision of these indicators, published in October 2007, contains 
a core set of 50 indicators covering poverty, governance, health, 
education, demographics, natural hazards, atmosphere, land, 
oceans, seas and coasts, freshwater, biodiversity, economic 
development, global economic partnership, and consumption 
and production patterns (UN 2007b).

The Framework for the Development of Environment Statistics (UN 
1984) serves as a template and guide for countries to develop 
and organize environmental and related socio-economic data. 
The United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD) has endorsed 
a work programme to update this framework with a view to 
transforming it into a hub for a broader range of producers of 
environment statistics, including not only traditional statistical 
data-collection instruments of national statistical systems but 
also information from scientific monitoring. The update aims to 
improve coordination of environmental data within countries, 
and improve coordination of environmental, economic and social 
data (UN 2009).

Data collection, dissemination, training and capacity-building 
programmes in environment statistics are coordinated by an 
Intersecretariat Working Group on Environment Statistics (IWG-
ENV), convened by the UNSD. The UNSD/UNEP Questionnaire 
on Environment Statistics covers the themes of water, air, land 
and waste (UN 2011). The UNSD also collects specific data 
on the status of national environmental-economic accounting 
(UN 2007a) and has developed a System of Environmental-
Economic Accounting (SEEA) under the United Nations 
Committee of Experts on Environmental-Economic Accounting 
(UNCEEA). The Committee for the Coordination of Statistical 
Activities (CCSA) coordinates the statistical data work of UN 
entities and international partners, such as the Organisation 
for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the 
Statistical Office of the European Union (Eurostat),

and exchange of data between UN entities is facilitated by the 
UN data mechanism (data.un.org). 

Prominent sets of indicators and indices relate to the Millennium 
Development Goals (MDGs), in particular ten indicators related 
to MDG 7 on ensuring environmental sustainability; the United 
Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Human Development 
Index (HDI); Yale University’s Environmental Performance Index 
and the OECD’s Core and Key Environmental Indicators as well as 
the Core Set of Indicators of the European Environment Agency 
(EEA). A number of environment-related, global and regional 
conventions have monitoring and reporting programmes, and 
many of the convention secretariats, such as that for the Montreal 
Protocol, support countries with the collection, monitoring, 
interpretation and analysis of data in their area of responsibility 
(UNEP 1999).

Geospatial data, from technologies such as satellite remote 
sensing and networks of weather stations and ocean buoys, are 
another important source of environmental information. Large, 
international global-change research programmes and initiatives 
such as the Group on Earth Observations System of Systems 
(GEOSS) offer new opportunities to access this type of information. 
GEOSS was set up to provide decision-making support tools to a 
wide variety of users by linking existing and planned observation 
systems around the world, and supporting the development 
of new systems where gaps exist. It also promotes common 
technical standards that make it possible to combine data from 
many different observation instruments into coherent datasets. 
In addition, the GEOSS Data Sharing Principles have encouraged 
satellite operators to enable greater access to data (GEO 2010).

UNEP’s Environmental Data Explorer (geodata.grid.unep.ch) 
compiles and presents a wide range of economic, social and 
environmental data covering more than 500 variables, which 
can be used to track the state and trends of the environment in 
support of GEO and other environmental assessments. Updated 
lists of data providers and variables can be accessed on the Data 
Explorer (Table 8.1). 

THEMATIC GAPS 
Many global programmes focus on supporting and compiling 
data collected at the national level. In almost all thematic 
areas, data availability is geographically unbalanced and data 

are generally scarcer in developing countries. Data collected at 
sub-national levels – for example on urban air quality – tend to 
be even more fragmented. Variables that are linked to industrial 
activities and organized sectors of the economy – including 
some sources of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions – are easier to 
measure and monitor. Other issues, including forest cover, can 
be assessed on a broad scale using satellite remote sensing. 
However, the effects of environmental change, such as air or 
water pollution eroding human health, may be spread over 
wide areas and be difficult both to measure and to attribute to a 
particular cause. These limitations present a serious challenge 
to measuring the consequences of environmental change. 

Review of Data Needs 219

Research on both scientific and policy aspects of the state of 
the environment is continuously developing and countries face 
greater challenges in collecting data on newly emerging issues. 
Data collection and monitoring in the polar regions, on the 
high seas and in the upper atmosphere rely on international 
cooperation programmes.

Atmosphere
•	 Climate	data	remain	limited	in	some	regions,	with	marked	

scarcity in developing countries. Understanding temperature 
changes at finer resolution than continental scales – and 
attributing them to human or natural causes – remains 
difficult, and is complicated by factors such as land-use 
change and pollution (IPCC 2007). The impacts of climate 
change and extreme events depend on a range of economic, 
social, geographic, cultural, institutional, governance and 
environmental factors, such as levels of wealth and education, 
disability and health status, as well as gender, age and social 
status. In general, data on disasters and measures to reduce 
disaster risk are lacking at the local level (IPCC 2011).

•	 Data	relating	to	emissions	of	greenhouse	gases,	ozone-
depleting substances and many other pollutants have 

improved in recent years as they are required and 
supported by a number of international programmes and 
conventions, including the United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Montreal 
Protocol. The policy relevance of emissions data can be 
increased by disaggregating them by sector, for example 
transport, and by such sub-sectors as road, air and water 
transport and type of fuel and engine. Data availability 
is more limited for countries that are not Parties to the 
relevant conventions; gaps are often filled through the use 
of model estimates. 

•	 There	are	many	gaps	in	air	quality	data	relating	to	pollutants	

that are not the focus of global conventions – nitrates, 
sulphates, tropospheric ozone, particulate matter and black 
carbon – especially in developing countries, and, even where 
data are available, they can be fragmented and difficult 
to access. Indoor air pollution is a leading cause of death, 
especially in low-income countries, with a disproportionate 
impact on women; WHO’s programme to assess the global 
burden of disease uses estimates of the effects of indoor air 
pollution, because it is impractical to monitor inside people’s 
homes (WHO 2010, 2009).

Land
Different methods of assessing land cover and use continue 
to yield very different results. In general, there are many 
deficiencies in the available data on these issues. 
 

•	 The	extent	of	drylands	in	the	world	is	uncertain	because	of	

different classifications and methodologies used by different 
programmes (ICTSD 2007). 

•	 The	limited	globally	comparable	data	on	land	degradation	

– an essential information base for dryland nations to 
address the problem – date from the Global Assessment 
of Human Induced Soil Degradation (GLASOD) in 1990 (UN 
2004), although new estimates using satellite data are being 
developed. 

•	 There	is	no	comprehensive	and	complete	global	database	of	

wetlands, and different estimates of global wetlands extent are 
very inconsistent (Lehner and Döll 2004; Finlayson et al. 1999). 

•	 Remote	sensing	has	advanced	knowledge	of	land	cover	and	
land use, but reliable information on changes is limited as 
data from different points in time are often not comparable 
because of changing sensor technology, insufficient ground 
truthing and a lack of agreement on ecosystem delineations. 
There are multiple definitions for forest, for example.

•	 Satellite-derived	estimates	of	urban	area,	less	than	0.5	

per cent of global land cover, are four- to sixfold lower than 
previous estimates based on global urban population maps 
(Schneider et al. 2009).

•	 Two	recent	FAO	reviews	of	deforestation	showed	very	different	

trends for 2000–2005, with one based on national reports 
showing a slower rate of deforestation than in the past, while 
the other, based on remote sensing, suggests a faster rate 
(FAO and EC-JRC 2011; Hansen et al. 2010). 

•	 Baseline	data	and	monitoring	of	changes	in	carbon	stocks	

are needed, and evidence is still emerging of the significant 
carbon sequestration potential of rangelands and grasslands.

Kathmandu, where local residents sometimes queue for hours waiting 
for their turn to collect clean drinking water. © Wendy Townrow/iStock

transboundary aquifer systems will be a major task for the 
Transboundary Water Assessment Programme (UNEP 2011a). 

•	 In	general,	data	on	groundwater,	including	availability,	

quality, extraction, uses, management and legislation, are 
more limited than data on surface waters. Rectifying this 
should be a priority since groundwater is being extracted 
unsustainably in many regions. Additionally, limited data are 
available on groundwater contamination from substances 
such as nitrates and arsenic. 

•	Data	on	biofuels	–	including	the	extent	of	production	and	use	
– are fragmented and incomplete at the global level, although 
datasets can be found at the national level in some countries. 

•	 Information	on	access	to	drinking	water	and	sanitation	has	
improved to track the MDG 7 target; sex-disaggregated data 
on these issues remain a high priority. 

•	 The	International	Fund	for	Agricultural	Development	(IFAD)	is	
monitoring a set of indicators to assess country performance 
in ensuring that poor people have access to land and tenure 
security (IFAD 2008). Governments could apply these and 
other social, economic and environmental indicators (Bach 
et al. 2009) to evaluate the impacts of land-use changes and 
large-scale international land deals in Africa or elsewhere.

Water
•	 Comprehensive	data	on	water	quality	and	quantity	remain	
a priority; mapping and the compilation of an inventory of 

•	 No	global	datasets	are	available	to	evaluate	trends	in	all	

water-related diseases, although global trend data on cholera 
are used as a proxy. 

•	 UN-Water	compiles	information	on	the	state	and	trends	of	

integrated water management approaches (UN-Water 2008a). 

•	 Exchange	of	comparable	information,	as	well	as	joint	

monitoring and assessment, is necessary for long-
term, sustainable and reliable cooperation in managing 
transboundary waters (UN-Water 2008b). 

Review of Data Needs 221

Box 8.2 Glacier monitoring in the Himalayas

Glaciers in the Himalayas and other high mountains in Asia 
are the source of the continent’s major rivers, supporting 
vulnerable, densely populated river basins downstream. 
Understanding fluctuations in the mass of glaciers is essential 
for decision making on water resources, agriculture and 
disaster risk reduction in downstream areas. Changes in the 
mass of glaciers depend on a multitude of complex elements, 
including the glacier’s size, the microclimate, local topography, 
altitude range, aspect in relation to the sun, and variations in 
influences of the Indian monsoons and the deserts of Central 
Asia and western China. There is also huge uncertainty about 
how snow and glacial melting in the Himalayan region will 
continue to respond to climate change, and how such change 
will affect ecosystems and human well-being.

The ability to measure the area and length of glaciers 
has been improved through remote sensing, although 
there are still limitations, including access to appropriate 
satellite images and confirmation of results through field 

surveys (ground truthing). Glacier length and area alone, 
however, are not the only significant factors: thickness is 
also important but is much more difficult to measure. Lack 
of sufficient Himalayan meteorological data and monitoring 
stations has also been a major handicap in drawing 
conclusions on the impact of climate change on glaciers, 
snow cover and associated phenomena such as glacial lake 
outburst floods. Another challenge is that the Himalayas 
are spread across eight countries with different financial 
capabilities and socio-economic objectives, meaning that 
international coordination may be required to strengthen a 
long-term programme in the region.

“We have anecdotal evidence that glaciers may be receding, 
but we need precise and carefully vetted data, both through 
satellite imaging and ground surveys.” Indian Prime Minister 
Manmohan Singh

•	 Comparable	data	are	needed	on	water	resource	efficiency	by	
sector and country, water footprint, and movements of virtual 
water in traded products. 

•	 A	body	of	research	and	a	number	of	initiatives	are	improving	

data on emerging issues relating to oceans and marine 
ecosystems, including ocean acidification, marine litter, 
water quality for bathing, carbon sequestered by marine 
organisms, the status of coral reefs and algal blooms. All 
regions have at least some information on fisheries status 
and trends but, in general, there are major gaps in global 
coverage of data on the marine environment as a whole, 
especially in areas beyond national jurisdiction, and 
consistent time series are rarely maintained (UNEP 
and IOC-UNESCO 2009). 

•	 The	availability	of	data	on	glaciers	and	ice	coverage	is	
improving through observation networks and remote 
sensing (Box 8.2), but information on permafrost is mostly 
still at the research stage, with monitoring taking place in 
only a few areas. 

Biodiversity 
Data on the state of biodiversity, such as protected areas and 
threatened species, is improving but uneven (BIP 2010). For 
instance, there is better data on birds and mammals than on 
invertebrates and plants. In general, monitoring is least extensive 
in tropical regions, although they contain the greatest share of 
global biodiversity (UNEP 2011a). 

•	 Data	on	invasive	species	populations,	when	available,	are	
probably substantial underestimates, especially for many 

developing countries. Addressing this gap is a high priority for 
small islands, which suffer heavily from invasive alien species. 

•	 Countries	will	report	on	the	Aichi	Biodiversity	Targets	2011–
2020 under the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). A 
recent review evaluates adequacy of existing observation 
systems to support reporting on these targets and identifies 
a number of data gaps (GEO BON 2011).

•	 Under	the	previous	2010	Biodiversity	Indicators	Partnership	

(BIP 2010), indicators for themes such as the status of 
access and benefit sharing, as well as traditional knowledge, 
could not be fully developed because of a lack  
of comprehensive data. 

•	 A	substantial	effort	has	been	made	in	the	past	to	gather	data	

on natural resources that are consumed directly, such as 
fish and timber, but data quality is not adequate to monitor 
changes in the composition of fish catches that result from 
fishing down the food web.

 
•	 There	is	a	lack	of	data	allowing	the	linking	of	trends	in	the	

state of biodiversity with the drivers of biodiversity loss, such 
as changes in habitat extent, ocean acidification, overfishing 
and chemicals. 

•	 There	is	no	comprehensive	assessment	of	the	number	and	

extent of community-managed protected areas. 

•	 Initiatives	such	as	the	Millennium	Ecosystem	Assessment	
(MA) and The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity 
(TEEB) have pioneered approaches to assess and value a

broader range of ecosystem goods and services – for example 
regulating services including the value of ecosystems for 
disaster risk reduction, and cultural services – but the 
ability of most national statistical systems to support these 
approaches is still limited.

Chemicals and waste 
•	The	effects	of	chemicals	on	human	health	and	the	

environment have only been assessed against modern 
standards (USEPA 2005) for a small number of substances. 
Data on the effects at different dosages or concentrations, or 
the effects of combined exposure to multiple chemicals, are 
at an even earlier stage of research or are absent. In addition, 
risk assessment procedures often use average adult data, so 
risks to children also need to be considered. 

•	 Many	chemicals	became	established	items	of	commerce	

before systematic assessments were made (Lowell Center for 
Sustainable Production 2003), and concerns have arisen over 
unsuspected properties such as endocrine disruption, which 
can damage the hormonal and reproductive system of people 
and animals (UNEP 2010). 

•	 Chemicals	legislation	in	a	number	of	developed	countries,	

such as the European Commission’s REACH programme, 
has established data inventories that are greatly improving 
access to information on issues such as chemical toxicity and 
socio-economic impacts (EC 2012). 

•	 Many	new	materials	containing	nanoparticles	are	produced	

and widely marketed, but safety testing has been limited 
even though some potential for human exposure has been 
identified (Morris et al. 2011; Sass et al. 2006). 

•	 Data	on	hazardous	wastes	at	the	international	level	are	

mainly provided through reports submitted to the Secretariat 
of the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary 
Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal, but 
the number of national reports is declining and the data 
they contain can be sparse and difficult to interpret. Data 
on transboundary movements of hazardous wastes is 
satisfactory according to a recent analysis report, in part 
since data from Parties that report also include information 
on transboundary movements involving Parties that do not. 
Nonetheless, more data are needed about the generation of 
hazardous wastes and their treatment by importing states. 
Concerns have also been expressed about the quality of 
some of the data, and data do not cover illegal movements or 
generation and disposal in the informal sector  
(Basel Convention 2010). 

•	 Reliable	data	about	waste	generation,	collection	and	

management worldwide are lacking, especially in most 
developing regions. Municipal and household waste should 
be a particular priority together with industrial and hazardous 
waste. Data collection on municipal and household waste is 
complex and time-consuming, and there is a risk of

collection companies and disposal facilities. 

•	 In	most	high-income	countries,	severely	polluted	sites	have	

already been identified and remediated, but in many low- 
and middle-income countries, pollution hotspots are poorly 
documented, and sometimes are completely unknown to 
local and national governments (Blacksmith Institute 2011).

•	 Long-term	monitoring	programmes	for	persistent	organic

developing countries (UNEP/GPA 2006).

Policy and responses
•	 Quantitative	targets	can	spur	the	collection	of	data	to	
track whether the targets are being met, but only a few 
international goals – such as the MDG 7 targets for water and 
sanitation – include quantitative environmental targets. 

•	 Some	information	is	available	on	the	implementation	status	

of ecolabelling, certification and similar programmes; on 
protected areas; and on ratification and implementation of 
conventions. This comes from convention secretariats or 
compilations such as ECOLEX (www.ecolex.org). 

•	 Limited	data	are	available	on	issues	such	as	environmental	

expenditures, green investments, green gross domestic 
product accounting, trends in and effectiveness of payment

and environmental policy effectiveness. 

•	 Governments	and	other	stakeholders	can	monitor	

environmental policies by looking at their implementation 
status, such as the extent of protected areas or of compliance 
with vehicle emissions regulations, or at their impact, such as 
trends in species extinction risk or in air quality.

data and conventional gross domestic product (GDP) – have 
a solid history that is difficult to match in the environmental 
domain. A number of initiatives, such as the System of 
Environmental-Economic Accounting (SEEA) (UN et al. 2003) 
and UNEP’s Green Economy Initiative (UNEP 2011c), have 
supported the development of environmental and social 
indicators to complement GDP, and are starting to be applied 
in different countries worldwide. 

•	 Basic	data	on	population	trends	and	distribution	are	

improving. Socio-economic data relating more closely to 
the state of the environment – on issues such as poverty-

environment and environment-security links – are still based 
mainly on proxy data and case studies. Tools such as the T-21 
model of the Millennium Institute (UNEP 2011b) combine 
environmental and socio-economic data and produce 
policy-relevant information, for example to demonstrate how 
resource depletion could affect GDP. 

•	 Sex-disaggregated	data	on	issues	relating	to	the	environment	

are generally lacking, especially for developing countries, 
making it difficult to analyse and understand disparities in 
natural resource use and management structures. 

•		Data	on	resource	use	and	efficiencies	as	well	as	material	

flows are improving, but solid baseline data on issues such 
as resource stocks are often lacking. 

•	 The	availability	of	data	on	energy	production	and	

consumption, including renewable energy, are also 
improving through the International Energy Agency 
and other organizations (IEA 2011).

REGIONAL INITIATIVES AND PRIORITIES
Many regional programmes aim at strengthening environmental 
information on the basis of the specific needs, development 
status and priority environmental issues of countries in each 
region. Table 8.2 lists a selection of these programmes and 
regional priority needs.

Table 8.2: Selected regional initiatives and priorities for environmental information

Africa

•	 United	Nations	Statistics	Division	(UNSD),	the	African	Centre	for	Statistics	and	UNEP	are	supporting	countries	in	developing	
a core list of indicators for Africa, based on the Commission on Sustainable Development (CSD) indicators, the Millennium 
Development Goals (MDGs) and the New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD)

•	 Sub-regional	organizations	like	the	Economic	Community	for	West	African	States	(ECOWAS)	are	increasing	their	involvement,	

based on programmes in related areas like food security and economic development

•	 In	general,	Africa	is	a	high-priority	region	for	capacity	development	in	environment	statistics

Asia and the Pacific •	 Overall,	Asian	countries	have	a	relatively	high	response	rate	to	the	UNSD/UNEP	Questionnaire	on	Environment	Statistics,	

whereas the response rate from Pacific countries is low (UN 2011); development in the region varies widely between countries 

•	 Regional	organizations	provide	support	on	certain	issues,	such	as	compilation	of	statistics	from	various	sources	by	the	Economic	

Europe

and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) and the Asian Development Bank

•	 A	number	of	programmes	exist	on	specific	themes	and/or	covering	different	sub-regions,	for	instance:
  
  
  
  
  
  

- Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)/UNEP Asia-Pacific Material Flows
- Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Centre for Biodiversity
- UNEP/ South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) South Asia Environment Outlook
- Acid Deposition Monitoring Network in East Asia (EANET)
- Clean Air Initiative – Asia (data on issues such as air quality, energy and transport in Asian cities)
- Mekong River Commission (for example water level data)

•	 The	European	Commission,	Eurostat	and	the	European	Environment	Agency	(EEA)	are	the	main	sources	of	environmental	data	in	

Western and Central Europe, and they are extending their related capacity-building efforts into Central Asia

•	 Eurostat	collects,	produces,	analyses	and	disseminates	statistics	on	the	state	of	and	pressures	on	the	environment	–	as	well	as	
a range of related economic and social data – based largely on data provided by national statistical offices of its member states 
(Eurostat 2010)

•	 EEA	and	its	member	and	cooperating	countries	operate	the	European	Environment	Information	and	Observation	Network	

(EIONET) for multi-country data collection, organization and dissemination

•	 Eurostat	and	OECD	circulate	a	Joint	Questionnaire	on	the	State	of	the	Environment	covering	member	states	of	both	organizations
•	 Environmental	data	and	information	are	more	sparse	in	European	countries	that	are	not	members	of	either	organization,	
including a number of countries in Eastern and South Eastern Europe; one priority in many of these countries is to restore 
monitoring networks and related data time series that were discontinued in the 1990s (UNECE 2003)

•	 The	Helsinki	Commission	for	the	Baltic	Sea,	the	OSPAR	Commission	for	the	North-East	Atlantic,	the	Barcelona	Convention	for	the	

Mediterranean Sea and the Black Sea Commission operate data programmes covering their respective marine areas

•	 The	pan-European	scientific	monitoring	network	of	the	UNECE	Convention	on	Long	Range	Transboundary	Air	Pollution	(CLRTAP)	

has been pivotal in providing the evidence identifying the most important European air quality issues

Latin America and  
the Caribbean

•	 A	number	of	regional	initiatives	are	promoting	and	coordinating	environment	statistics	in	the	region,	including:
  
 
 
•	 According	to	a	recent	survey	of	national	statistical	offices	and	environment	ministries	in	the	region,	81%	of	the	participating	

- the Latin American and Caribbean Initiative for Sustainable Development (ILAC, 32 agencies from 24 countries as of end 2011)
- the Working Group on Environmental Statistics of the Statistical Conference of the Americas (15 institutions from 10 countries)
- sub-regional initiatives such as the Andean Community Indicators and the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) Indicators

institutions had an environment statistics programme, although only 36% had a specific budget dedicated to it; other significant 
institutional challenges remain in many countries (ECLAC 2011)

North America

West Asia

•	 Data	and	information	to	track	the	state	of	the	environment	is	collected	and	analysed	by	a	variety	of	government	agencies	as	

well as academic and other institutions, including Environment Canada, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)

•	 US	government	and	academic	institutions	also	collect	and	provide	access	to	global	environmental	data	on	a	number	of	issues	

including sea level, surface temperature, land cover and coral bleaching (Table 8.1)

•	 The	Abu	Dhabi	Global	Environmental	Data	Initiative	(AGEDI),	in	partnership	with	UNEP,	promotes	enhanced	collection,	

dissemination and use of environmental data and information. These and other organizations are co-sponsoring the Global 
Network of Networks initiative, aimed at effective access to the world’s expanding pool of environmental data

•	 A	core	set	of	environmental	indicators	for	West	Asia,	developed	by	the	League	of	Arab	States	(LAS)	in	partnership	with	the	
Economic and Social Commission for West Asia (ESCWA) and UNEP, has been established by countries of the region on a 
voluntary basis

•	 An	Arab	Environmental	Information	Network	is	being	developed	under	the	umbrella	of	LAS,	with	support	from	UNEP	and	in	

collaboration with ESCWA, AGEDI and other organizations

•	 In	many	countries	of	the	region,	official	statistics	on	the	environment	are	rarely	generated,	difficult	to	access	and	scattered	

among different institutions, and reporting is fragmented (UNEP 2006); major thematic gaps and priorities include data on land 
salinization, coastal and marine pollution, disasters, waste management and transport (UNEP 2006)

Review of Data Needs 225

NATIONAL CAPACITY NEEDS
Data collected at the national level are some of the most important 
sources of information to track the state and trends of the global 
environment. Environment statistics is an emerging field in 
most countries, and many have only scattered data (UN 2011). 
Most developing countries currently have no comprehensive 
environmental observation system. Data may exist but are often 
discontinuous, making it difficult to establish a baseline to 
measure change over time or progress against targets. The recent 
UNDP/UNEP/GEF synthesis of National Capacity Self-Assessments 

noted that more than 90 per cent of the 119 participating countries 
identified “information management and knowledge” as a 
capacity need. While selecting a list of environmental indicators 
and collecting information was more straightforward in many 
countries, the main challenge involved managing this information 
and coordination of the organizations involved, including 
research institutions and programmes. National environmental 
management information systems need to be strengthened, as 
well as the skill sets of associated staff. Measures to address 
this include application of standards, use of communication

technologies and networks, as well as capacity development, 
public awareness activities and environmental education. In 
addition, while many stakeholders recognized the value of 
traditional knowledge for environmental management, few 
countries felt it was captured well, if at all, and used to develop 
environmental policies and programmes (UNDP et al. 2010).

•	 Strengthening	institutional	arrangements	and	expertise	for	

coordination of environmental and scientific information 
that exist in-country but may be fragmented, based on clear 
roles and responsibilities of different agencies, and the 
incorporation of economic, social and environmental data 
into national statistical systems.

Recent assessments of the status of national environmental 
information include the National Capacity Self-Assessments, 
the UNSD/UNEP Questionnaire on Environment Statistics, 
and various regional and bilateral needs assessments. UNSD 
country snapshots (Figure 8.1) summarize the environment 
statistics that are available, and indicate those that are 
not, from each country. The specific needs to strengthen 
environmental information vary in each country, but normally 
relate to the following issues.

•	 Collection	of	high-quality	data	that	adequately	cover	a	full	

range of established core indicators that can be used to 
monitor the state and trends of the environment, such as the 
UN Sustainable Development Indicators (UN 2007b), and that 
are coherent and comparable. Figure 8.2 provides general 
information on the existing and planned thematic coverage of 
national environment statistics programmes.

•	 Establishment	of	long-term	monitoring	programmes	in	priority	
areas – based on consistent support in terms of funding and 
personnel, amongst others – collecting data that are reliable 
and are available in comparable time series (UNECE 2003). 

•	 Promoting	the	easy	accessibility	of	data	and	information	
(UNCED 1992) for a range of users and the general public, 
addressing language barriers as well as cost, security and 
intellectual property concerns, providing on-line access 
and harnessing other new technologies to disseminate and 
present environmental information.

•	Supporting	institutional	and	other	arrangements	that	increase	

the use of national data, indicators and information, for 
instance for environmental assessments; policy making; 
convention reporting; and educational, scientific and 
awareness-raising purposes.

“The challenges posed by environment statistics 
are generally greater than for most other types of 
statistics… Most significant perhaps is the fact that 
a national statistical office must rely heavily on 
other agencies to collect and supply the bulk of the 
primary data. Such a high degree of interdependence 
between different government bodies demands close 
cooperation and collaboration.” 

ADB 2002

•	 Developing	the	necessary	in-country	expertise	and	capacity	

for data collection, quality assessment, analysis and 
interpretation on different themes.

Scale is very important with respect to environmental data. Some 
environmental problems are global, such as climate change; 
others are best addressed and monitored at a regional level, or

at the level of maritime area (for example fish stocks) or 
watershed (for example water availability and quality). Many 
types of air pollution are best monitored at the municipal 
level. Other issues affect ecosystems, for instance Amazon 
deforestation affects parts of several countries in South 
America. The boundaries of an ecological zone, and the scale 
on which environmental problems occur, will rarely if ever 
coincide with national or provincial borders or other official 
geographic delineations (ADB 2002). Nevertheless, government 
programmes – national statistics in particular – are important

for ensuring consistent, long-term support to data collection and 
dissemination, and the use of scientifically credible information 
for policy making. In strengthening these programmes, it is useful 
to consider how environment statistics can be collected at scales 
relevant to the problems concerned.

Many of the constraints on environmental data at the national 
level are strongly linked with the availability of financial and 
human resources. The cost of national environmental information 
systems may vary greatly in different countries, and it is 
important to ensure that methods for data collection, analysis 
and dissemination are clear and cost effective (ADB 2002). 
In order to strengthen the collection of environmental data in 
countries and, where possible, to improve consistency with 
international standards it is also important that environmental 
information supports national policy goals and that policy makers 
understand its value to their constituency, with international 
financial support, capacity building and technical assistance 
available when needed. 

CONCLUSIONS
Sound environmental assessments must be underpinned by 
high-quality scientific environmental, social and economic data. 
Environmental data are also important to monitor the impacts 
of environmental policies and programmes. As described 
in this review, a large number of initiatives are collecting, 
supporting and improving access to environmental information 
at the global, regional and national levels. Ongoing and future 
priorities include promoting, where possible, the use of common 
standards for data collection and analysis, increased data 
sharing, consistent time series of environmental observations, 
capacity building to strengthen environment statistics in a 
wider range of countries, and harnessing new technologies to 
communicate environmental information effectively to policy 
makers and the public.

Main Messages 

In Africa, population growth, rapid urbanization, 
climate change, unsustainable development choices 
and weak governance persist as critical challenges 
to achieving both the environmental and the social 
aspects of important regional goals.

Embarking on mutually reinforcing policies works 
to Africa’s advantage. For nations faced with limited 
resources, maximizing policy synergies helps 
deliver social, ecological and economic benefits, 
reduces trade-offs, and provides multiple paths 
for addressing common drivers and pressures. For 
example, sustainable land management policies 
support positive outcomes in diverse environmental 
domains including marine ecosystems, biodiversity 
and freshwater. This will, however, require the 
harmonization of policies between the local, 
national, regional and global levels to avoid adverse 
environmental and social impacts. For example, 
global policies – such as those for food, biofuels 
and climate mitigation – should not undercut local 
livelihoods and adaptive capacity.

Transboundary natural resource policies strengthen 
the integrated management of shared terrestrial and 
marine ecosystems. The popularity of this approach 
in Africa underscores its validity as a useful strategy 
with wide applicability. 

Networks of marine managed areas rather than 
individual, strictly protected marine areas provide 
more opportunity for comprehensive management 
of marine resources. Benefits include fisheries 
recovery, improved migratory species conservation, 
reduced land- and sea-based pollution, and 
enhanced social and ecological resilience to  
climate change.

The recognition and up-scaling of human rights, 
including the rights of indigenous people and 

women, support improved human and environmental 
well-being, as demonstrated by the recognition of 
the right to water at national levels and by the African 
Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights. 

Adequate capacity is critical for effective natural 
resource management and governance. Needs 
differ across levels, making capacity assessment 
at multiple scales necessary to identify solutions. 
Innovative institutional arrangements for pooling 
knowledge, capacity and financial resources 
help build long-term collaboration to achieve 
environmental goals, as approaches for pollution 
management demonstrate.

Management that considers the whole ecosystem, 
including people, is more likely to be effective in 
maintaining environmental goods and services and 
human well-being, as sustainable land management 
and integrated coastal zone management show. 
Africa’s extensive use of community-based 
environmental management has helped poor rural 
communities generate revenues from wildlife-
based enterprises and enabled nations to improve 
their conservation of large mammals and related 
ecosystems. The success of this approach hinges 
on the extent to which governments have devolved 
authority and rights over natural resources.

Strong accountability with secure participation, 
access to information and consent ensure that 
decisions are environmentally and socially 
sustainable. Africa’s growing reliance on extractive 
resource use makes securing accountability 
important to avoid special-interest decisions. 
Monitoring government performance and tracking 
environmental trends supports effective and 
timely response to ongoing environmental change, 
including extreme natural events, and sets the basis 
for further policy development.

Part 2: Policy Options

INTRODUCTION
Over the last generation, Africa has built a substantial record 
of responding to environmental challenges while addressing 
human well-being, and this provides a point of departure for 
strengthening policy and implementation. This chapter considers 
12 promising policy options identified as contributing to 
achieving a set of regionally selected international goals (Table 
9.1) (see Introduction to GEO-5 for methodology). 

As the policy appraisal shows, innovation by and partnerships 
between African people and their governments have underpinned 
this success, while the support of donors has been crucial to 
the implementation of some policies. The principles of the Paris 
Declaration on Aid Effectiveness – ownership, harmonization, 
alignment, management for results and mutual accountability – 
define collaboration with donors and are designed to ensure that aid 
supports agreed government priorities and uses, and strengthens 
government systems rather than developing parallel institutions. 

Despite tremendous progress, significant challenges remain, 
including population growth, rapid urbanization, climate change, 
unsustainable development choices and weak governance. 

Africa’s population – 1 billion in 2009 – is growing at close to 
2.15 per cent per year (UN 2011), placing increasing demand on 
environmental resources. In 2010, some 395 million people, or 40 
per cent of the total population, lived in urban areas. By 2040, the 
urban population is likely to be 1 billion and by 2050, 1.23 billion 
– 60 per cent of the total (UN-Habitat 2010). In Africa’s cities – 

characterized by extremes of prosperous centres and poor, informal 
settlements – many governments struggle to provide social services 
including access to water, to achieve food and energy security, and 
to manage environmental risks (Figures 9.1 and 9.2). Climate change 
and other adverse environmental change may increase urbanization

The (cid:31)(cid:30)(cid:30)(cid:29) World Food Summit in Rome agreed that “food security exists when all people, at all times, have physical and economic access to sucient, 
safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life” (FAO (cid:31)(cid:30)(cid:30)(cid:29)). This relies on food availability, 
accessibility, reliability and quality, as well as acknowledging preference (Frayne et al. (cid:27)(cid:26)(cid:31)(cid:26); Sen (cid:31)(cid:30)(cid:25)(cid:31)).

Africa 235

(UN-Habitat 2010) and further strain governments’ ability to cope, 
leading to greater instability (Mohamed-Katerere 2009). 

Climate change – by exerting extreme pressure on ecological 
systems – is likely to increase the stress of vulnerable populations 
in urban and rural areas (Boko et al. 2007). More intense rainfall 
events contribute to more run-off and floods, threatening food 
security and settlements, while longer periods between rains 
and changing seasonal patterns contribute to crop loss. Sea level 
rise is likely to have significant impacts on coastal settlements, 
given the high population in potentially hazardous areas (Nicholls 
2004), including Akpakpa in Benin and Lagos in Nigeria, making 

climate-sensitive policies critical for conservation and adaptation. 
However, most existing policy lacks the framework to address 
the complex challenges of human vulnerability to climate change 
(Madzwamuse 2010). The adoption of risk reduction strategies, 
improved well-being, and better preparedness can result in 
reduced vulnerability even in these circumstances. Prospects 
are, however, currently limited; Figure 9.1 shows that exposure 
to flood and the risk of mortality are outpacing reductions in 
vulnerability (UNISDR 2011).

Policies and practices that originate outside the region can 
contribute to environmental change. External investments in

Part 2: Policy Options

In their actions to achieve the objective of the Convention and to implement its provisions, the Parties shall be 
guided, inter alia, by the following:
1. The Parties should protect the climate system for the benefit of present and future generations of humankind, 
on the basis of equity and in accordance with their common but differentiated responsibilities and respective 
capabilities. Accordingly, the developed country Parties should take the lead in combating climate change and 
the adverse effects thereof.

2. The specific needs and special circumstances of developing country Parties, especially those that are 

particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change, and of those Parties, especially developing 
country Parties, that would have to bear a disproportionate or abnormal burden under the Convention, should 
be given full consideration.

3. The Parties should take precautionary measures to anticipate, prevent or minimize the causes of climate 

change and mitigate its adverse effects. Where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage, lack of full 
scientific certainty should not be used as a reason for postponing such measures, taking into account that 
policies and measures to deal with climate change should be cost-effective so as to ensure global benefits 
at the lowest possible cost. To achieve this, such policies and measures should take into account different 
socio-economic contexts, be comprehensive, cover all relevant sources, sinks and reservoirs of greenhouse 
gases and adaptation, and comprise all economic sectors. Efforts to address climate change may be carried out 
cooperatively by interested Parties.

Develop and implement integrated land management and water-use plans that are based on sustainable use 
of renewable resources and on integrated assessments of socio-economic and environmental potentials and 
strengthen the capacity of Governments, local authorities and communities to monitor and manage the quantity 
and quality of land and water resources.

Each Contracting Party shall, as far as possible and as appropriate:
(a) integrate consideration of the conservation and sustainable use of biological resources into national 

decision-making;

(b) adopt measures relating to the use of biological resources to avoid or minimize adverse impacts on 

biological diversity;

(c) protect and encourage customary use of biological resources in accordance with traditional cultural practices 

that are compatible with conservation or sustainable use requirements;

(d) support local populations to develop and implement remedial action in degraded areas where biological 

diversity has been reduced; and

(e) encourage cooperation between its governmental authorities and its private sector in developing methods for 

sustainable use of biological resources.

Improve the efficient use of water resources and promote their allocation among competing uses in a way that 
gives priority to the satisfaction of basic human needs and balances the requirement of preserving or restoring 
ecosystems and their functions, in particular in fragile environments, with human domestic, industrial and 
agriculture needs, including safeguarding drinking water quality.

Promote the conservation and sustainable use of coastal and marine ecosystems as well as their natural resources.

land deals have increased rapidly as global demands for food 
and biofuels have risen – some 45 million hectares of such 
land investments, 70 per cent of the global total, are in Africa 
(Deininger et al. 2009). Frequently, these investments have 
adverse impacts on land resources and livelihoods  
(Cotula 2008). Other examples of external drivers include climate 
change and waste disposal practices that have adverse impacts 
on land and water quality, and consequently on human health 
and food security. This makes the harmonization of policies 
between different countries as well as different regions a priority.

Over the last ten years, Africa’s development approach has 
focused on securing growth through resource extraction, especially 
in the oil and mining sectors, and expansion of infrastructure. In 
the absence of strategic and integrated environmental assessment 
and robust accountability systems, this has led to environmental 
degradation. For example, weak accountability in decision-making 
systems has contributed to forest loss (FAO 2010).

While governance and institutional arrangements vary, some 
challenges are of regional significance given the similarities 
across nations. Conflicting laws, values and interests in and 
between countries adversely affect the ability to develop 
the collaborative institutional systems that are essential for 
managing ecosystems and responding to common challenges 
such as drought (Mohamed-Katerere 2001). At times, this 
disparity has resulted in resource conflicts, including over the fair 
allocation of land and water (Mohamed-Katerere 2009; Ashton 
2000). Inequitable sharing of the benefits and losses of natural 
resource management also reduces social-ecological resilience, 
often creating conflict as deteriorating conditions in one sphere 
affect another (Mohamed-Katerere 2009). Weak land tenure, 
insufficient accountability and poor transparency compound this 

adverse reality. Sectoral planning that treats the environment as 
a set of separate resources rather than as a composite system 
further undermines environmental management. In this complex 
and unsatisfactory governance context, it is often vulnerable 
groups that suffer most (Jäger et al. 2007). 

POLICY APPRAISAL 
This section appraises the selected policy options and shows 
that they are often mutually reinforcing, with positive impacts in 
more than one thematic domain. For example, developing more 
effective accountability measures or strategies for collaboration 
are shown to have positive outcomes in diverse policies, 
including for marine managed areas and natural solutions for 
adaptation and mitigation. Further, the policy options address a 
common set of drivers and pressures, as identified in the section 
above. Table 9.2 provides insight into these links and also shows 
benefits in social, ecological and economic domains. For African 
nations under increasing strain and faced with limited resources, 
maximizing benefits and synergies among these domains 
while reducing trade-offs can help place environmental and 
development choices on a path of sustainability. 

The appraisal provides broad indicative lessons about conditions 
for replication and achieving the policy goals. Simple attribution 
of positive outcomes to any one policy is problematic as multiple 
factors contribute to success. Weak systems for monitoring 
and tracking policy outcomes in social, environmental, 
economic and political domains mean that the appraisal relies 
primarily on qualitative analysis from peer-reviewed literature 
and documented project experience. Some of the identified 
policy options are in the early stages of implementation and 
consequently show limited impact; nevertheless, current results 
suggest potential for up-scaling and replication.

Part 2: Policy Options

Transboundary natural resource management
Transboundary approaches to environmental and natural 
resource management contribute to achieving the agreed goals 
(Table 9.1) in all thematic areas (Table 9.2). There are many 
examples of successful transboundary initiatives throughout 
Africa (Huggins et al. 2006; Jones and Chonguiça 2001; Wilkie  
et al. 2001), although there are significant variations in their 
focus, structure, delivery and scope. 

These approaches demonstrate success in minimizing biodiversity 
loss, supporting integrated land and water management, 
improving local benefits, contributing to fairer and more equitable 
resource sharing including of ground- and surface water, and 
improving climate mitigation and the availability of resources for 
adaptation (Boxes 9.1 and 9.2) (Dudley et al. 2010). Importantly, 
transboundary approaches often enhance cooperation and 
reduce conflict by facilitating dialogue, establishing networks – 
including of marine protected areas – and encouraging learning 
and knowledge sharing (Abdulla et al. 2009; Huggins et al. 2006; 
Mohamed-Katerere 2001; Rodgers et al. 2001). This helps create 
the political stability needed for economic and development 
cooperation. There are, however, many challenges.

Transboundary approaches are inherently complex processes 
involving many actors, issues and agendas. Strengthening dialogue 
can contribute to achieving consensus (Box 9.2) (Conca and 
Dabelko 2002), but reaching it is nonetheless challenging 
(Ervin et al. 2010). Efforts to bring different countries and 
sectors of society together can create rifts and alienate some 

Box 9.2 Collaborative water management: Organization 
for the Development of the Senegal River Basin

In 1974, the Organization for the Development of the Senegal 
River Basin (OMVS) was established by Mali, Mauritania 
and Senegal as a supra-national authority to agree water 
allocation and dam management principles (Varis et al. 
2006). Water entitlements of riparian countries are made on 
the basis of demand from three sectors – navigation, energy 
and irrigation – as negotiated by the parties, and not on the 
basis of volume demand. 

Successes include irrigation of some 375 000 hectares in 
Senegal, Mali and Mauritania, the provision of 200 megawatts 
of electricity to the three countries (Madamombe 2005), and 
securing year-round navigation of a 900-km stretch of the 
river from Kayes to Saint-Louis, supporting livelihoods for 
many. A saltwater prevention barrage near the estuary, the 
Diama Dam, and flood control measures provide support for 
farmers practising flood-recession agriculture near the dam. In 
addition, the OMVS has contributed to political and regional 
cooperation, reducing the potential for conflict and increasing 
investment in basin resource management. 

Despite this success, the complicated institutional set-
up of OMVS has not always been able to deal effectively 
with conflicts (Varis et al. 2006). Furthermore, lack of 
harmonization of OMVS and national action presents 
challenges for basin management. 

Box 9.1 The Sangha Tri-National Landscape

The Sangha Tri-National Landscape (TNS) consists of three 
national parks – Lobéké (Cameroon), Nouabalé-Ndoki 
(Congo) and Dzanga-Ndoki (Central African Republic) – 
covering 4.52 million hectares. This area includes logging 
concessions, community use zones and hunting areas. 

The TNS economy is based on the extractive use of timber, 
bushmeat, palm wine and fish, which provide support to 
indigenous communities. The goal is to ensure that all use 
is sustainable. However, the actual impact of this extractive 
economy on the socio-economic conditions of local people is not 
easy to quantify because communities are somewhat diffuse. 

Biological surveys show healthy populations of endangered 
wild species, notably elephants and great apes. The TNS also 
helps maintain the integrity of species’ migratory patterns. 
Experience to date indicates that harmonization is required in 
transnational legislation for forestry, indigenous land use and 
hunting. True and just compensation for the area’s indigenous 
communities needs greater attention and analysis. 

communities (Muboko 2011), and scaled-up management may 
marginalize local users from decision making and reduce access to 
valuable livelihood resources (Whande 2010). Implementation can 
also be impeded by ill-defined rights to land and resources, weak 
governance processes, and conflicting interests and goals (Katerere 
et al. 2001). Consequently, the development and harmonization 
of laws and policy are essential (Mohamed-Katerere 2001).

The rapid increase in transboundary natural resource management 
demonstrates that this policy, despite some challenges, has 
high potential for replication and for managing Africa’s diverse 
shared ecosystems. For example, given that 75 per cent of African 
countries are coastal and that 70 per cent of river basins are 
shared by two or more countries, collaborative governance is 
essential for sustainable approaches. 

Marine managed areas
Marine managed areas are part of a suite of approaches applied 
in Africa that contribute directly to achieving the oceans and seas 
goal, and also to the biodiversity and climate change goals by 
securing coastal ecosystems and environmental services.

The objectives of marine managed areas – which often include 
strictly protected no-take zones or other marine protected 

Africa 239

challenging. Consequently they are often smaller and wider apart 
than is ecologically viable (Abdulla et al. 2009). 

Establishing managed marine areas can be an effective 
alternative, as they include multiple management zones and 
protected no-take zones. The information required for the 
design of such no-take zones can be obtained through rigorous 
quantitative research in a few representative sites combined 
with comprehensive surveys of traditional knowledge (Johannes 
1998). Once designated, many managed marine areas face a lack 
of adequate resources for proper enforcement of regulations. 
However, alternative enforcement approaches can be used, 
including local community guards (Andrews 1998). An added 
advantage of managed marine areas is that they can control 
any unsustainable use that is displaced by fully protected no-
take zones. Individually, however, countries may be unable to 
address this as use may occur in areas beyond their legislative 
jurisdiction, such as the high seas, all of which suggests a 
need for more collaborative and transboundary approaches. 
For example, Africa’s widest network of managed marine areas, 
which stretches over 23 sites in six countries of Western Africa 
– Cape Verde, the Gambia, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Mauritania 
and Senegal – has had considerable success in ensuring that 
fisheries, tourism, and oil and gas development do not adversely 
affect the marine ecosystem and its biological resources 
(Karibuhoye 2008).

Africa’s 45 649-km coastline (Vafeidis et al. 2005), which 
encompasses 33 of the region’s 48 mainland countries and 

areas in addition to multi-use areas – complement a broad 
range of national development and economic goals other than 
biodiversity conservation. These goals include improved food 
security, better livelihoods, effective governance and sustained 
economic growth. Managed areas complement other regulatory 
policies such as fisheries and water quality management. For 
example, five-year rotational harvesting in managed areas off 
the east coast of South Africa contributes to the rapid recovery of 
oyster populations during fallow years (de Bruyn et al. 2009).

Although the establishment of marine protected areas has 
often been relied on to improve marine conservation, they face 
multiple challenges. Disparities in governance, institutional 
capacities, wealth distribution, social capital and availability 
of ecological data can affect both their establishment and 
their effectiveness (Abdulla et al. 2009, 2008). In some cases, 
marine protected areas face opposition from adversely impacted 
sectors of society. For example, tourism operators resisted the 
establishment of marine protected areas in Kenya because they 
could not afford the licensing fees, protective clothing, insurance 
and equipment required by new regulations (Weru 2004). Local 
fishers who are excluded from their previous fishing zones may 
also oppose protected area development (Apostolaki et al. 
2002). In addition, many countries cannot afford comprehensive 
research on all marine habitats within their jurisdiction, making 
the identification and development of marine protected areas 

Box 9.3 A network of managers in the Mediterranean

The establishment of an ecological network of effective 
marine managed areas requires a multidisciplinary and multi-
level approach, with strong commitment from governmental 
and non-governmental organizations as well as the scientific 
community. Although governance and legal challenges have 
halted the implementation of transboundary environmental 
policies in Northern Africa (Abdulla et al. 2008), international 
cooperation platforms provide a significant opportunity 
to achieve ecosystem conservation targets. In the 
Mediterranean, UNEP and the conservation organization WWF 
partnered to create MedPAN, a network of marine protected 
area managers that connects more than 40 marine managed 
areas and supports them to work on a number of coordinated 
and common initiatives (MedPAN 2011). The network is a 
tool and a neutral platform for non-governmental and local 
governmental agencies to deliver services in an efficient 
way. The partnership has proved successful for the transfer 
of knowledge, and improved management capacity, data 
collection, and monitoring and evaluation. This ultimately 
supports a bottom-up approach, which contributes to 
building a constituency of practitioners able to influence 
decision makers on the conservation of marine resources.

Part 2: Policy Options

six island nations, illustrates the importance of strengthening 
marine management. Up-scaling managed areas and establishing 
a network is a step beyond the more traditional approach of 
establishing them opportunistically as single independent 
entities. Through interconnections and interdependencies, 
the individual elements of the network contribute positively to 
each other’s integrity by decreasing overall vulnerability. Marine 
food webs extend beyond the boundaries of individual areas, 
and fishers are dependent on different species and geographic 
regions at different times of the year. Tourism revenues from 
an accessible managed area with charismatic species can help 
subsidize the maintenance costs of more remote places with no 
other values that can be easily captured through current market 
mechanisms. Many biophysical and socio-economic connections 
overlap national boundaries, and regional cooperation can 
promote national interests. Currently unmanaged areas merit 
priority attention within a larger managed area framework 
(Abdulla et al. 2009). As part of a regional marine conservation 
agenda, the formation of managed networks in those areas where 
coverage is minimal and urgently needed – including Northern 
Africa (Mediterranean Sea), northeast Africa (the Red Sea), 
the Gulf of Guinea and Southern Africa – has seen some initial 
successes (Box 9.3). 

Regional approaches to marine pollution management
Regional approaches that include a mix of self-regulated, 
state-enforced and collaborative management are effective in 
addressing the multiple drivers and diverse scales of marine 
pollution, and hence in achieving the selected goal for oceans 
and seas. A reduction in marine pollution also contributes to the 
biodiversity and climate change goals (Table 9.2). 

Coastal urban growth contributes to residential effluent, industrial 
discharges, storm-water run-off, agricultural and mining leaching, 
contaminated groundwater seepage, and industrial and vehicle 
exhaust fumes that enter the marine environment. The coastal 
cities of Accra in Ghana, Douala in Cameroon, Lagos and Port 
Harcourt in Nigeria and Luanda in Angola, for example, are all 
adversely affected by industrial pollutants (Ibe and Sherman 
2002). Oil spillage and discharge from marine transport present 
major management and regulatory challenges, especially for oil-
producing countries such as Libya and Nigeria, where problems 
are severe (Golik et al. 1988). Offshore exploration, especially 
for oil (GEF et al. 2006), contributes to pollution from dumping at 
sea, accidental and intentional oil spills, engine leaks and noise 
(Abdulla and Linden 2008). 

Comprehensive regional marine pollution conventions govern the 
four major African coastal regions. The Convention for Co-operation 
in the Protection and Development of the Marine and Coastal 
Environment of the West and Central African Region (Abidjan 
Convention) and the Regional Convention for the Conservation 
of the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden Environment (Jeddah Convention), 
and their associated protocols, provide important regulatory 
mechanisms for high-use areas and employ a self-regulatory 
approach. The benefit of self-regulation is that it is quick to 
respond, flexible, and sensitive to market circumstances (Osborn 

and Datta 2006). The primary drawback is that the responsibility 
falls on the industry to control pollution (Buckley 1994), and 
the incentives to do so may be insufficient. Waste exchange 
programmes, initiated under the Guinea Current Large Marine 
Ecosystem programme, have effectively supported waste 
reduction and ecosystem recovery (Ukwe and Ibe 2010). In 
Ghana, this has focused on using the waste from one industry as 
raw material for another. 

Action plans to increase the capacity of port waste reception 
facilities have been developed regionally, although on-the-ground 
progress has been limited. For example, the Benguela Current 
Large Marine Ecosystem programme has promoted the sharing 
of facilities between ports in the Benguela and Guinea Current 
regions through assessment of reception facilities, technical 
training needs and regional capacity requirements as related to 
the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from 
Ships 1973, as modified by its 1978 Protocol (MARPOL 73/78) 
(Awad 2008). This process has increased the involvement of key 
regional stakeholders and advanced some key operational areas 
of the convention. The Port Management Association of West 
and Central Africa incorporates marine pollution compliance and 
requires further investment from ports and industry partners. 
The need to address the shortage of technical management 
capacity has been tackled by the International Ocean Institute–
Southern Africa through targeted regional training for countries 
of Western Africa. The existing network of large marine ecosystem 
programmes, port management associations and regional 
conventions provides further opportunity for replication of this 
model. Tax-based policies can complement this approach by 
extending a company’s liability for environmental damage, 
although a common argument against tax-based policies is that 
they give the right to pollute if they are not punitive enough. 
When citizens have standing in the courts they can serve as an 
important check on industrial practice, as the Niger Delta Ogoni 
case demonstrates, a case that is also pertinent to the policy 
option on human rights. This in turn provides an incentive for 
improved environmental performance.

Although the regional conventions and their protocols are 
relatively comprehensive in addressing the various marine 
pollution issues, significant risks remain due to the lack of 
implementation of these regimes in some countries. But 
successes exist – as demonstrated by developments under the 
Convention for the Protection, Management and Development of 
the Marine and Coastal Environment of the Eastern African Region 
(Nairobi Convention) (Box 9.4). 

With a network consisting of existing regional International 
Maritime Organization (IMO) offices in Western and Eastern 
Africa, various regional conventions, and the regional seas 
and large marine ecosystem programmes, it is clear that the 
appropriate policy platforms are in place to combat marine 
pollution. However, there is a paucity of capacity for management 
in terms of equipment, technical training and institutional 
support, as well as for implementing existing policies, making 
investment in these areas a priority.

Western Indian Ocean 

Box 9.5 The Ambatovy Business and Biodiversity 
Offsets Programme (BBOP), Madagascar 

The Nairobi Convention (UNEP 1985) has been instrumental 
in developing and implementing marine pollution 
management projects in the Western Indian Ocean, which 
includes Eastern Africa and the region’s island countries. 

Biodiversity offsets – conservation activities designed to 
deliver biodiversity benefits in compensation for losses, in 
a measurable way – are included in the Madagascar Action 
Plan 2007–2012 as priority projects. 

An operational platform provided by the convention – which 
brought global investment for the development of policy and 
management frameworks – was the key strength that led 
to successful policy initiation and implementation. Other 
critical features are the IMO regional office in Nairobi and 
the Agulhas and Somali Currents Large Marine Ecosystem 
project, which provide additional technical support, 
including assistance in developing national contingency 
and action plans.

Project development and implementation underpin the 
convention’s success. For example, the World Bank/GEF-funded 
Western Indian Ocean Highway Development and Coastal 
Marine Contamination Prevention Project, implemented through 
the Indian Ocean Commission and the South African Maritime 
Safety Authority, has the following goals: 
•	 development	of	an	electronically	supported	marine	highway	
system for ship guidance and monitoring within the region; 
•	 further	extension	and	implementation	of	the	Indian	Ocean	
Memorandum of Understanding on Port State Control; and
•	 building	capacity	for	coastal	sensitivity	mapping	and	oil-

spill response. 

Current project success includes the development of a joint 
draft regional contingency plan. A Regional Coordination Centre 
for Marine Pollution Preparedness and Response is envisaged 
to develop a secretariat that would implement the plan.

Payment for ecosystem services and biodiversity 
offsets
Innovative mechanisms such as payment for ecosystem services 
and biodiversity offsets contribute to achieving all the identified 
goals (Table 9.1) by encouraging, compensating and rewarding 
environmental custodians for maintaining or restoring valued 
environmental services (Swallow et al. 2009). 

A growing portfolio of payment for ecosystem services in Africa 
demonstrates benefits for both nature and people, including for 
watershed services in Eastern and Southern Africa (Stanton et 
al. 2010). Biodiversity offset programmes have been adopted 
in Ghana, Guinea, Madagascar and South Africa (Madsen et al. 
2010). Payment for ecosystem services and offset approaches 
have also been used to support eco-labelling and community 
tourism, to protect fragile and valued habitats including forests, 

In 2004, the Ambatovy Mining Project adopted the BBOP 
project, which includes an off-site offset area of 11 600 
hectares of endangered forest, 4 900 hectares of on-
site conservation zones and a forest corridor to ensure 
connectivity with remaining eastern rainforests. Support is 
also given to an adjacent Ramsar wetland and reforestation. 
The BBOP process led to the integration of the project into 
local, regional and national plans. Support for capacity 
building has increased the potential for successful replication.

The project has, however, faced multiple challenges. Since 
2006, agreements with the local communities not to expand 
agriculture and environmentally degrading activities have 
been breached. This demonstrates the difficulty of achieving 
consensus when livelihood opportunities are lost. Developing 
a third-party mechanism to verify claims could ensure 
fairness and equity in making trade-offs. Other barriers to 
success relate to difficulties in identifying sites with similar 
environmental characteristics and comparable biological 
diversity as offset sites.

mangroves and coral reefs (Box 9.5) (Swallow et al. 2009), and to 
sequester carbon (REDD+). 

Despite some positive outcomes from these approaches, 
barriers to success remain (Wunder 2008; Landell-Mills and 
Porras 2002). Opportunities for local communities continue to 
be limited: for example, large landowners or companies supply 
most biodiversity offsets (Box 9.5) even though low-income 
communities could be competitive suppliers of biodiversity 
compensation (Milder et al. 2010). The weak negotiating capacity 
of communities makes it difficult for them to participate and 
secure livelihood benefits that exceed their opportunity costs 
(Swallow et al. 2009; Wunder 2005).

There is considerable potential for expanding payment for 
ecosystem services in Africa (Table 9.3), as the region lags 
behind others in developing such approaches (Dillaha et al. 
2007). In the global carbon offset market for 2011, for example, 
Africa accounted for less than 3 per cent of emission reduction 
projects, albeit the region has seen a strong growth trend in 
the past few years (UNEP Risoe Centre 2011). Enabling factors 
include agreeing to a set of principles; strengthening the legal 
framework including certification and capacity building of buyers

and sellers; encouraging participation by small-scale players by 
granting them land title or use, access or co-management rights; 
focusing on long-term livelihood assets rather than on short-
term benefits; reducing corruption and “rent-seeking”; creating 
a more transparent business framework; and facilitating bi- and 
multilateral knowledge-sharing initiatives (Milder et al. 2010; 
Swallow et al. 2009; Wunder 2005).

Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest 
Degradation 
Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation 
(REDD+), including the role of conservation, sustainable management 
of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks, is a payment 
for ecosystem services mechanism currently being negotiated 
under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
Change (UNFCCC). Various multilateral processes are underway 
to support countries in preparing for REDD+ implementation.

With the right safeguards in place, REDD+ could support climate 
mitigation through carbon sequestration – the climate change 
goal – and could also address important social and environmental 
dimensions that could lead to improved livelihoods. Depending 
on design, REDD+ initiatives may also offer new incentives for 
addressing the biodiversity and freshwater goals by enhancing 
forests and the land goal by reducing economic reliance on 
land-degrading activities. If the current focus is extended beyond 
terrestrial forests to include mangroves (Crooks et al. 2011), 
REDD+ equivalents could also support realization of the oceans 
and seas and land goals (Table 9.2).

Although REDD+ is in its preparatory phase, there are some 
readiness activities, pilot projects and bi-lateral initiatives as 
well as carbon sequestration projects from which lessons can 
be garnered. Preliminary evidence suggests benefits for climate 
mitigation and the environment as well as for people, primarily 
through supplementary income (Box 9.6) (Bond et al. 2010; 
Madeira 2009).

Early lessons from carbon sequestration projects suggest that 
unless several challenges facing REDD+ are resolved, market-
based approaches could fail to achieve positive outcomes, or 
might even increase global emissions (Davis 2011; Horta 2009). 

Box 9.6 Mozambique: A pilot project in the voluntary 
carbon market

A voluntary carbon credit project established in 2003 in Sofala 
Province of Mozambique has helped reduce poverty in the 
region, which is still suffering from the impacts of the civil war. 

By late 2009, the project included 1 510 farmers who rely on 
subsistence farming, wood gathering and hunting. Between 
2003 and 2009, carbon credits totalling US$1.3 million were 
sold, corresponding to 156 000 tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) 
at an average price of US$9.0 per tonne. Farmers received a 
third of the income, the initiating company received a third 
and its local non-profit subsidiary received a third for project 
monitoring and evaluation. The project increased rural 
employment from 8.6 per cent to 32 per cent, whilst 73 per 
cent of households raised commercial crops compared with 
23 per cent previously. There was a measurable increase in 
literacy and the development of a business ethos and skills. 

The main difficulties revolved around measuring and evaluating 
carbon sequestration, including establishing a baseline and 
assessing increases in stocks. Existing satellite data were found 
to be insufficient, and community management and governance 
presented further challenges. Earnings were reduced by the 
relatively high costs of carbon sequestration, at US$3.4 per 
tonne of CO2, and by the inability to sell all the credits.

Africa where significant deforestation is taking place (FAO 2011). 
The inclusion of these dry forests and woodlands would expand 
the relevance and impact of a post-Kyoto REDD+ mechanism 
(Hansen et al. 2010). 

As significant carbon stocks are held in coastal systems (Crooks 
et al. 2011) and soils, carbon credit schemes could be built 
into the design of new marine protected areas as public-private 
partnerships to enhance management and financing. Addressing 
the specific circumstances of communities and organizations 
running these REDD+ initiatives is also important, as in coastal 
zones their investments may be at risk from natural disasters. A 
further challenge for REDD+ is that climate mitigation activities 
are poorly integrated with adaptation and development. This is 
particularly problematic given Africa’s high levels of poverty and 
vulnerability to climate change. 

Integrated coastal zone management
Integrated coastal zone management provides a management 
framework that takes into account complex, non-linear 
interactions between and within human and ecological systems 
and across temporal and spatial domains, and consequently 
takes a significant step towards coherent management of 
entire ecosystems. It prioritizes the land-sea interface with the 
objective of balancing economic development and environmental 
protection, consequently contributing to all five selected goals 
(Tables 9.1 and 9.2). 

The number of African coastal countries adopting integrated coastal 
zone management increased from five in 1993 to 13 in 2000 
(Gustavson et al. 2008); this is supported by specific commitments 
to integrated management in regional agreements (Table 9.4). 

As a cross-sectoral approach, integrated coastal zone 
management involves all levels of governance and encourages 
the involvement of all stakeholders (Hewawasam 2000; Post and 
Lundin 1996). This is well illustrated for Eastern Africa’s coastal 
countries in the operation of the Secretariat for Eastern Africa 

Africa’s dryland forests are still poorly incorporated in REDD+. © Yemi Katerere

For success, REDD+ needs to address the enabling factors 
identified under the payment for ecosystem services policy 
option, and must also ensure that:
•		earnings	exceed	opportunities	foregone	from	agriculture	and	

the fuelwood market (Bond et al. 2010);

•	 secure	carbon	rights	that	encourage	equitable	benefit

of emissions (Makhado et al. 2011) are implemented;

•	 reduced	implementation	costs	are	achieved;
•	 effective	intersectoral	cooperation	is	established.	

A potentially important limitation of REDD+ is that the current 
UNFCCC forest definition excludes vast areas of open forests, 
generally in the dry tropics, and therefore overlooks important 
carbon stocks, for example in much of Eastern and Southern

Box 9.7 Action and commitment at regional and 
national levels

Although action and commitment to integrated coastal 
management is growing, multiple institutional challenges 
persist. The Toliary region of southwestern Madagascar 
suffers from a range of human-induced environmental 
problems. While these have been reduced using integrated 
coastal zone management, greater success has been 
hindered by a lack of regional coordination (Billè and 
Rochette 2010; Billè 2008). Specific challenges relate to the 
lack of clearly defined work programmes, procedures and 
regular coordination meetings. 

On the other hand, the Coastal Area Management 
Programme (CAMP) in the Mediterranean, which includes 
projects in Algeria, Egypt, Morocco and Tunisia, applies 
integrated management principles at multiple scales. 
This includes engagement at the local level, integration 
in policies and strategies at national and regional levels, 
and engaging at wider international and Mediterranean 
basin levels through cooperation and exchange with the 
Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment 
and the Coastal Region of the Mediterranean (Barcelona 
Convention). Challenges include the lack of continuous 
financial commitment that has resulted in many projects 
being halted, inadequate public participation, poor 
visibility of the projects and an absence of appropriate 
national legal frameworks (Gonzàlez-Riancho et al. 2009; 
SMAP III 2009). 

Coastal Area Management and in South Africa (DEAT 2011; MCM/
DEAT 2000). Success requires action and commitment at regional 
and national levels (Box 9.7).

Experience demonstrates that the integrated coastal zone 
management protocol of the Barcelona Convention could be 
strengthened substantially through the use of spatial planning 
tools. Although these have been used terrestrially for decades, 
the broader marine community has only recently adopted 
them. New technologies, including remote sensing, geographic 
information systems (GIS) and spatial modelling, provide vastly 
improved capacity to replicate the spatial structure of nature 
in models of human-environment interactions, and support a 
strategic decision-making process that creates a blueprint for 
ocean use. A key strength of these technologies is that they 
explicitly recognize that there are valid competing demands 
on natural resources and that ecosystem-based management 
solutions must work within the capacity of the local communities. 
As a result, these tools encourage the development of equitable 
and viable solutions to the conservation of socio-ecological 
systems (Bode et al. 2008).

Sustainable land management 
Sustainable land management can strengthen the management 
of water and land while incorporating social and economic values. 
Consequently, it supports achievement of the land and freshwater 
goals and contributes to the biodiversity, oceans and seas, and 
climate change goals (Tables 9.1 and 9.2). 

An example of this approach is the TerrAfrica initiative. This 
multi-partner platform for consultation and action includes 
intergovernmental and civil society organizations. In partnership 

Box 9.8 Sustainable land management in Burkina Faso and Ethiopia 

Experience in Burkina Faso and Ethiopia under the 
Global Mechanism of the United Nations Convention to 
Combat Desertification (UNCCD) suggests that small-scale 
investments and improved farm and community practices 
can form the basis for scaled-up national sustainable land 
management programmes. 

In Burkina Faso, the Gestion des Terroirs approach involves 
community-based land management, creates awareness of 
environmental degradation and land conservation, supports 
development by local government of new regulations for 
natural resource management, and encourages the adoption 
of sustainable land management. This includes soil fertility 
management, mixed farming, the use of organic manure and 
other agricultural inputs, and water and soil conservation 
techniques. Traditional approaches for soil restoration and 
fertilization include, respectively, the use of stone cordons 

(diguettes) and organic farming methods. The data show that the 
use of agricultural inputs such as fertilizers without investment in 
sustainable management is often inefficient and uneconomical, 
suggesting that stronger links need to be made between 
agricultural production and sustainable land management. 

The Ethiopia Strategic Investment Framework for sustainable 
land management presents a strategy for scaling-up such 
activities based on best practice. The National Sustainable 
Land Management Platform has been established and will 
be replicated at regional level. The programme will cover 
177 watersheds in eight regions over five years, based on 
the model of participatory watershed management. Local 
involvement in design and priority setting, along with 
improvements in water availability and food production, can 
catalyse the spread of existing sustainable land management 
technologies as farmers learn from each other.

Africa 245

with the governments of Burkina Faso, Ghana, Namibia and 
Uganda, TerrAfrica supports country-level approaches. Dialogue 
on sustainable land management has been initiated in several 
countries including Eritrea, the Gambia, Malawi, Mali, Niger, 
Nigeria and Senegal. The success of TerrAfrica, including in Burkina 
Faso, Ethiopia, Ghana, Mozambique and Uganda, suggests a 
high potential for integrated and participatory land management 
approaches to be replicated in other countries (Box 9.8). 

Recognizing that addressing climate change as part of 
sustainable land management is essential to ensure adaptation 
and address climate-related land changes (Pender et al. 2009), 
TerrAfrica established climate change as a core priority in 2009. 
Adaptation policies should complement farmers’ responses to 
climate change, including water harvesting and natural solutions 
such as ecosystem restoration (Table 9.2) (Below et al. 2010).

Sustainable land management approaches appear to be most 
successful where there is high-level political support and when 
they build upon local knowledge and practice. This contributes 
to creating effective stakeholder coalitions and platforms, 
improving the development, management and dissemination 
of knowledge, and more effectively leveraging the investments 
required for sustainable management activities.

An on-going challenge in establishing sustainable management 
is land tenure insecurity. Many governments are rectifying 
this through land tenure reform: for example, Niger’s Rural 
Code establishes a framework for protecting and revitalizing 
pastoralism, where previous policies favoured crop farmers 

Box 9.9 The land rights challenge in Mozambique 

Mozambique’s 1997 Land Law recognizes individual and 
collective tenure rights and embraces customary African 
law. Local authorities have control over the delimitation and 
allocation of land-use rights, the resolution of disputes and 
resource management (Kanji et al. 2006; Burr 2005). The 
law also protects various human rights including women’s 
rights, customary land claims to uncultivated fields and 
rights of way, and the rights of internally displaced people 
– all consistent with rights in international law. The Land 
Law also expands consultation and the bargaining power of 
communities. Outside investors, for example, are required 
to negotiate with customary rights holders to obtain leases 
within the customary area (CTC 2003; Norfolk and Liversage 
2001). Such arrangements, however, are not easy for 
communities to negotiate and tend to be manipulated by 
politicians and other influential people (Brown 2003; Hanlon 
2002). In some instances, communities are not fully aware 
of the provisions of the Land Law. An added challenge is 
that government officials responsible for implementing the 
law often have little awareness either of the rights or of the 
procedures for securing them (Serra and Tanner 2008). 

(Jamart 2011). It has promoted the preservation of pastoral 
areas and protected herders’ rights to collective use since 1993, 
including rights to move their livestock in search of water and 
pasture (Jamart 2011). In 2010 the Rural Code was modified to 
address outstanding ambiguities. For example, although the 
code established land commissions as representative organs in 
which all stakeholders participate, people still turn to religious 
and customary leaders first to resolve any land issue. A remaining 
challenge is to stop the encroachment of pastoral areas by 
croplands as farmers migrate north under demographic pressure. 

Mozambique’s experience (Box 9.9) demonstrates that in 
replicating sustainable land management and land tenure, 
greater attention must be given to community empowerment and 
the capacity of state implementing agencies. Given the similarity 
in land-use systems across Africa, these approaches could be 
replicated in other countries. 

Human rights
Policy approaches that incorporate human rights contribute to 
the selected freshwater goal (Box 9.10), the land goal through 
better recognition of local tenure (Box 9.9), and the biodiversity 
and oceans and seas goals by holding decision makers 
accountable for decisions that adversely affect the environment. 
Importantly, these approaches support the achievement of the 
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) at the same time as 
delivering benefits to the environment (Campese et al. 2009). 
Conversely, a lack of rights is often synonymous with high levels 
of vulnerability (ICHRP 2008; Jäger et al. 2007), as experience 
with external investments in land deals in Africa illustrates 
(Cotula 2011; Locher 2011).

Human rights are important for protecting people and the 
environment when there are strong incentives for natural 
resource exploitation (Bond and Dugard 2007), as is the case 
in much of Africa. Governance rights, including participation 
and free prior informed consent, help ensure that local people’s 
rights are taken into account. Human rights provide a benchmark 
for making sustainable choices and encouraging equitable and 
non-discriminatory outcomes (ICHRP 2008). Once decisions have 
been made, litigation can provide a basis for their evaluation. 
In Nigeria, communities have used human rights law to oppose 
oil exploration that has adversely affected agricultural land and 
biodiversity, including for example in the court case Kenule 
Beeson Saro-Wiwa, President of the Movement for the Survival of 
the Ogoni People (MOSOP) and Eight Others, unreported 1995 
(Frynas 1999; Idowu 1999). In 2002, the African Commission on 
Human and People’s rights found that under the African Charter 
the Nigerian government has an obligation to protect the well-
being of the Ogoni People (Social and Economic Rights Centre 
v Nigeria). Giving effect to this decision would limit the way in 
which oil exploration takes place and ensure protection of the 
environment, health and livelihoods. 

Governance based on human rights may appear to be 
cumbersome, but it encourages rigour in decision making and 
ensures that multiple issues and values are taken into account.

Part 2: Policy Options

Box 9.10 Recognizing a human right to water can promote fairer access 

The South African constitution provides a right of access to 
sufficient water, implemented through the Free Basic Water 
Policy 42/2001. Many impoverished households benefit from 
secure access (within 200 metres of the household) to at least 
25 litres of water per person per day for domestic use (Mehta 
2005). This is equivalent to the World Health Organization’s 
recommendation for minimum consumption, though it does 
not cover broader health and livelihood needs.

Positive outcomes include a saving of the time and effort 
women and girls spend collecting water, freeing them 
to engage in other activities, and less need to resort to 
unprotected water sources, thus reducing vulnerability to 
water-borne disease (Mehta 2005). In addition, citizens 
attribute such policies directly to good governance, and 
this in turn can support long-term political stability.

A major challenge for the policy is to strike a balance 
between the human benefits and the cost implications 
(DWAF 2002a). However, improvements in human well-being 
are seen as outweighing the associated costs (Stalk 2004). 
Decentralization of the responsibility for water provisioning to 

the district level has encouraged the municipalities to become 
more innovative (Stalk 2004), although some find it costly 
(DWAF 2002b). 

Failure to provide the legally guaranteed quantity has resulted 
in citizens instituting litigation. In the 2009 Constitutional 
Court case Mazibuko v City of Johannesburg, the court found 
that the state is required to take reasonable legislative and 
other measures, within available resources, to achieve the 
right to water (Larson 2010). Given cost and other barriers, the 
policy is still to be implemented in rural areas.

Other institutional and organizational challenges include the 
lack of community access to information and capacity. This 
case study demonstrates that critical enabling factors include: 

•	addressing	the	principle	of	cost	recovery;
•	identifying	target	groups;
•	ensuring	financing;
•	managing	demand;
•	building	capacity;
•	improving	access	to	information;	and	
•	facilitating	the	expansion	of	infrastructure.	

In the long term, human rights approaches encourage political 
stability and good social relations. However, they can be severely 
limited by costs (Box 9.10) (Larson 2010), and the capacity of 
rights holders to claim, protect and enjoy their rights is adversely 
affected by lack of access to information and knowledge, of 
access to justice and of capacity. 

in 1998, was designed to complement this role but is poorly 
utilized. For many, the lack of rights of individuals, groups, and 
non-governmental organizations to initiate legal action is a critical 
limitation on the effective use of the court by the public. Mali and 
Burkina Faso have granted individuals and non-governmental 
organizations direct access to the court (Wachira 2008).

Notwithstanding these and other challenges, there is potential 
for replication. Human rights perspectives are increasingly 
recognized in conservation and governance (Boxes 9.9 and 
9.10). The United Nations recognized a right to water in 2010 
(UNGA 2010). The African Commission on Human and People’s 
Rights found that failing to provide basic services such as water 
is a violation of the environmental right in the African Charter. 
Several African countries including the Democratic Republic of 
the Congo, South Africa and Uganda now recognize this right 
in their constitutions (Winkler 2008). For many African nations, 
the fast pace of urbanization and climate change will increase 
the challenge of supplying water, making water rights a part 
of the solution. The extension of a rights-based approach to 
other resources, such as land (Box 9.9), can support other 
environmental goals.

Strengthening existing regional institutions could encourage 
replication and better utilization of these approaches. The work 
of the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights – 
Africa’s main human rights monitoring body – has been limited 
by state reluctance to give effect to its decisions (Wachira 2008).

Local, inclusive and participatory approaches 
Policies that reinforce local rights to participate in environmental 
management help to strengthen stewardship, contributing to the 
biodiversity, land, water, oceans and seas, and climate change 
goals (Tables 9.1 and 9.2). These approaches can be incorporated 
across different conservation policies, such as sustainable land 
management, integrated coastal zone management, and natural 
solutions for adaptation to and mitigation of climate change. They 
broaden the livelihood base for millions of people, for example 
through transboundary natural resource management, marine 
managed areas and REDD+ (Box 9.11), strengthen local resilience, 
including through policies on water harvesting and natural 
solutions, and encourage learning across levels (Box 9.12). 

Since the 1990s, there has been a rise in the number of countries 
using local, inclusive and participatory approaches, and growth 
in the extent of land under this type of management (Koech et al. 
2009; Roe et al. 2009). For example, the percentage of forests 
under community tenure in Africa’s ten most forested countries 
increased during 2002–2008 from 1.2 million hectares to 6.1 
million hectares (Sunderlin et al. 2008). Several countries 
including Cameroon, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya and Senegal have 
policies that recognize sacred sites (Dudley et al. 2005; Lee and 
Schaaf 2003). Sites conserved by indigenous peoples and local 
communities can be successful in strengthening ecosystem 
management and restoring and maintaining biodiversity, and 
complement state protected areas (Lee and Schaaf 2003). 

A key challenge in sustaining these approaches has been the 
relatively low level of earnings from environmental management

Box 9.11 Butterfly farming in Arabuko Forest Reserve

Kenya’s 42 000-hectare Arabuko forest is home to the 
Kipepeo (Swahili for butterfly) community-based project, 
which has earned more than US$80 000 annually from the 
export of farmed butterfly pupae, thereby decreasing the use 
of wild biodiversity. 

This project demonstrates the tangible link between 
conservation and sustainable livelihoods. By shifting 
livelihood strategies from unsustainable use of wood 
products (firewood, charcoal and timber) to the commercial 
farming of forest insects, sustainability has been enhanced. 
This initiative has increased the awareness of communities 
and national institutions of the ecological and economic 
importance of insects and their forest habitats. Potential 
for replication of this kind of project is high, with butterfly 
farming now being practised in three other areas in Kenya and 
in the Usambara Forest of the United Republic of Tanzania.

relative to agriculture (Murombedzi 2010). Nevertheless, 
earnings are improving. In Namibia, conservancies’ revenues 
from wildlife-based enterprises increased from US$73 600 in 
1999 to US$4.3 million in 2009, while the Namibian economy 
earned more than US$32.5 million from community-based 
natural resource management (NASCO 2010). Other benefits 
associated with community-based approaches include inclusive 
governance, infrastructural development and reduced natural 
resource conflicts (Nelson 2010).

Assessing the overall effectiveness of community-based 
approaches is challenging, as there has been little empirical 
monitoring of the impacts on natural resources (Jones 2008). 
Where there has been monitoring, as in the Democratic Republic 
of the Congo, Namibia and South Africa, increases in wildlife 
populations have been recorded (Mehlman et al. 2006; Child 
2004; Jones 2004). In the Tayna Community Reserve in the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo there has been a tenfold 
increase in the elephant encounter rate, a threefold increase 
in the chimpanzee encounter rate and a twofold increase in 
the gorilla encounter rate, while during the same period signs 
of poaching activities decreased sevenfold (Mehlman et al. 
2006). The West Africa Pilot Community-Based Natural Resource 
and Wildlife Management Project in Côte d’Ivoire and Burkina 
Faso reported a reduction in agricultural encroachment within 
the conservation zones (World Bank 2008). Strengthened 
community security over the local forest commons has made 
these landholdings less vulnerable to appropriation by others 
or to conversion – leading to improved community earnings, 
biodiversity gains and enhanced forest condition (Sunderlin et al. 
2008; Banana and Ssembaijwe 2000). These successes suggest 
a strong basis for replicating this approach.

Box 9.12 Mapping landscapes in southern Cameroon

The Forest Land Oriented Resources Envisioning System 
(FLORES) is a participatory mapping initiative in eight 
communities in Akok near Ebolowa, the capital of Cameroon’s 
South Region. Geographic information system (GIS) methods 
were used in conjunction with focus groups and individual 
discussions with women, elders and men to explain social 
realities, perceptions and historical changes in land use. 
Community-developed base maps in combination with 
social/cultural data created a new understanding of defined 
landscape units, ownership, roads and historical land use as 
well as hunting and fishing rights (Robiglio et al. 2003). 

This approach enables the identification of social factors 
that influence land-use dynamics and the alignment of 
researchers’ perceptions with the reality of the communities 
using the land. Underlying challenges relate to the accuracy 
of defining spatial boundaries, poor understanding of local 
languages and high cost and time factors. 

Nevertheless, indications are that this approach provides data 
often lacking in environmental decision making and can be 
replicated in multiple geographic and social/cultural regions 
to support better links between environmental planning and 
social values and priorities (Robiglio et al. 2003).

Significant barriers to successful implementation remain for 
many local and participatory approaches. The inadequate 
enforcement and implementation of local rights remains a 
challenge: for example, government authorities have often been 
slow in allocating community entitlement to forests designated 
as community forests (see section on human rights) (Sunderlin 
et al. 2008). Conflicts between local and state laws, as well as 
suspicion about communities’ capacity to achieve sustainable 
management, affect government willingness to transfer authority. 
Better understanding of the multiple meanings and values 
attributed to forests by local communities can establish a basis for 
locally appropriate institutional arrangements (Box 9.12). Other 
barriers include the limited use of markets due to insufficient 
finance, poor information and technology flows, inadequate 
market links, and communities’ inability to exploit economies of 
scale (Scherr et al. 2004). Enhancing capacity and entitlements, 
as envisaged by the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), will 
be critical to improving environmental and social outcomes.

Water harvesting
Water harvesting is used to collect run-off or floodwater for storage 
in the soil or in tanks so that it can be used for the production 
of crops, trees or fodder and for domestic use. Water harvesting 
therefore supports the realization of the climate change goal 
(Table 9.1) in strengthening adaptation by ensuring access to 
freshwater and by reducing the run-off impacts of extreme rainfall 
events in tropical, sub-tropical and dryland conditions; in addition

management practices have contributed to a reduction in soil erosion.

it is appropriate for both rural and urban communities. Rainwater 
harvesting also contributes to achieving the freshwater and land 
goals (see policy on sustainable land management) and to the 
biodiversity goal through the restoration of water catchments.

The importance of this policy option is underpinned by climate 
change and the understanding that by 2020 some 75–250 million 

Box 9.13 Rainwater harvesting in Ethiopia

The lack of water for human consumption, livestock and crop 
farming has been a major constraint in the arid and semi-arid 
areas of Ethiopia. Nearly 80 per cent of the population lack 
access to a domestic water supply and an estimated  
46 per cent suffer hunger. The government has been engaged 
in promoting run-off and roof harvesting structures to help 
address this challenge. Ethiopia has a potential rainwater 
harvest equivalent to the needs of more than 520 million 
people (Mati et al. 2006). Farmers who harvested water 
improved their access to water for a longer period and were 
able to produce vegetables during the dry seasons, so had 
higher incomes than those who did not harvest rainwater. In 
Minjar Shenkora district of central Ethiopia, farmers who used 
harvested water for supplemental irrigation of onions and 
onion seedlings obtained average net incomes of  
US$155 per 100 m2 plot (Akalu and Adgo 2010). In areas 
where run-off was channelled into micro-catchments, greater 
plant growth improved fodder production and carrying capacity 
of the drylands (Abdelkdair and Schultz 2005). However, the 
initial construction costs of storage structures and inadequate 
build quality have undermined their wider adoption.

Africa 249

Africans will live in water-stressed areas (Boko et al. 2007), while 
an increase in extreme rainfall events will adversely affect soils 
and settlements, including cities. The potential of this approach 
is evident from diverse contexts: Box 9.13 shows its value in 
the Ethiopian context. Across the Sahel, innovative rainwater 
harvesting has been applied to hundreds of thousands of 
hectares, enhancing agricultural productivity and reducing human 
susceptibility to climatic variability (Box 9.14) (Reij et al. 2009). In 
Mali, research has quantified the impacts of rainwater harvesting 
on crop yield increases and ground water recharge (Doumbia et al. 
2008; Kablan et al. 2008).

Establishing effective water harvesting can be challenging, with 
access to resources, labour and skills being limiting factors 
(Boxes 9.13 and 9.14) (Saico and Kunene 2010). Families may 
not be able to afford storage facilities that cater to household 
size (Saico and Kunene 2010). The returns from water-harvesting 
investments can be long term, so weak land security for 
smallholders, and particularly for women, may make them 
reluctant to invest in such technologies. 

Nevertheless, the potential for rainwater harvesting is significant 
and can be replicated in many countries (Mati et al. 2006). 
Integrating water management into national adaptation planning 
can support the uptake of such technology by addressing legal 
and policy constraints and increasing community access to 
financial resources and skills. Several countries, including 
Togo, recognize water harvesting as a priority in their national 

adaptation programmes. Support for local knowledge, practice 
and innovation can empower communities to act and results 
in the diffusion of water harvesting through farmer-to-farmer 
learning. Box 9.14 demonstrates how traditional farming 
knowledge, which has evolved over hundreds of years in 
response to rainfall variability, has yielded multiple successes in 
managing scarce water resources and improving food production. 

Expanding opportunities for water harvesting can include the 
rehabilitation of degraded dams, restoration of watersheds, 
and conservation of existing forests that contribute to water 
provisioning. These strategies can improve year-round supply 
of water, soil conservation, and the expansion of livelihood 
activities including in the agro-pastoral sector (Box 9.13). 
 
Natural solutions for adaptation to and mitigation of 
climate change
The restoration and maintenance of ecosystems can provide 
valuable resources for climate adaptation, disaster risk reduction 
and mitigation (see also section on REDD+, above), and thus help 
achieve the climate change goal. By enhancing environmental 
goods and services, ecosystem restoration can also contribute 
to the realization of the land, oceans and seas, water, and 
biodiversity goals (Tables 9.1 and 9.2). 

Restoration can involve diverse actors at transboundary, 
national or community level and includes the maintenance of 
protected areas. By restoring or maintaining ecosystems, natural 

Box 9.14 Enhancing traditional water harvesting practices in Burkina Faso

Zaï planting, planting in a shallow pit, in Burkina Faso 
demonstrates that investment in water and soil conservation 
improves crop yields. In the Yatenga Province, for example, 
average sorghum yields increased from 594 kg per hectare 
during the period 1984–1988 to 733 kg per hectare in 
the period 1995–2001 as a result of the adoption of zaï 
techniques. Millet yields rose from 473 kg per hectare to 688 
kg per hectare for the same periods (Reij and Thiombiano 
2003). These improvements have resulted in a reduction of 
poverty. In Ranawa village, for example, the number of poor 
families decreased by 50 per cent between 1980 and 2001 
(Hien and Ouédraogo 2001).

While these technologies are rooted in local practice and can 
be mastered by all farmers, indications are that the better-
off and medium-income farmers use this technology more 
than poor farmers simply because they have the resources 
to pay for labour when needed (Kaboré and Reij 2004). The 
main disadvantage of the zaï techniques is that they require 
considerable physical effort and good health, especially 
where digging is required over a large area.

solutions provide opportunities for adaptation and mitigation. 
Mangrove restoration, for example, can enhance coping capacity 
by stabilizing coastlines (Duke et al. 2007; Mcleod and Salm 
2006). Mangrove restoration also supports adaptation through 
the provisioning of environmental goods such as food, fuel 
and wood. For example, Nigeria’s mangrove forests provide 
breeding grounds for more than 60 per cent of the fish caught 
between the Gulf of Guinea and Angola (Carrere 2009). In Sudan, 
the restoration of rangelands – achieved through rotational 
grazing and a shift in livestock composition – helped improve 
livestock pasture and food security (Buffle and Elasha 2011). An 
unexpected consequence of this effort was that pastoral nomads 
were attracted to the area, with conflict being avoided by using 
traditional local institutions and values to negotiate access. 
Protected areas, including in Niger, have been found to support 
the in situ conservation of wild crop relatives, which are often 
more drought resistant than domesticated crops and can be used 
to strengthen agriculture and food security (Dudley et al. 2010). 

Ecosystem restoration frequently requires a coherent but 
cross-cutting multisectoral approach as drivers and pressures 
exist at multiple levels. Large-scale or global drivers include oil 
exploration, agricultural expansion and pollution, infrastructure 
and transport development, population growth and settlements, 
and coastal development (Adger et al. 2005). At the same 
time, local livelihoods can place pressure on resources where 
governance and management are weak, for example through 
unsustainable fuelwood harvesting in mangroves (Ajonina et 
al.2005; Ajonina and Usongo 2001). Establishing integrated 
approaches that address drivers at multiple levels is often 
challenging, especially where coordination and collaboration 
between policy development agencies and policy implementing 
agencies are weak. Poor data collection, monitoring and 
information further constrain adaptive management. Inadequate 
legislation that is sector-based, conflicting, deficient and 
unenforceable provides a weak basis for planning and 
management (Madzwamuse 2010; Gordon et al. 2009). 

In addition, enhancing the conservation of ecosystems and 
their capacity to regenerate requires a better understanding of 
the links between different ecosystem components (Abdulla 
et al. 2011; Davis et al. 2011) as well as of social-ecological 
resilience (Johnson and Welch 2010; Adger et al. 2005). Investing 
in and generating ecological knowledge and translating it 
into information that can be used in governance and policy 
development is essential for management success (Adger et al. 
2005), and requires a better interface between science, policy 
makers and communities. Regional cooperation, community-
driven strategies and public-private partnerships (Box 9.15) 
can support learning, improve sustainability and encourage 
ecosystem approaches. The recently adopted Mangrove Charter 
for West Africa, which is complemented by country-specific action 
plans, is an example of this.

Given that adaptation is about local capacity, it is important 
that strategies and projects enjoy shared understanding 
between policy makers, technical agencies and communities 
(Box 9.16) (Patt and Schroeter 2005). Unless this is achieved, 
there is a risk that adaptation strategies will run counter to local 
livelihoods, values and cultures, and that uptake will be low, 
as in the government-initiated resettlement scheme following 
Cyclone Eline in 2000 in Mozambique (Patt and Schroeter 
2005). The loss of easy access to resources and social support 
were key obstacles to support for resettlement. A second major 
challenge was the conflicting perception of climate risk severity 
held by the government and the communities. These results 
highlight the need for active dialogue across stakeholder groups 
as a necessary condition for formulating and successfully 
implementing policies (Patt and Schroeter 2005). Ongoing 
dialogue creates the basis for reassessing strategies and 
responding to change (Box 9.16)

realizing human health goals. It contributes to achieving the social 

Box 9.15 Mangrove restoration in Mauritius

In 2008, in response to declining mangrove forests in 
Mauritius, the non-governmental organization Association 
pour le Développement Durable, with support from the 
European Union and the Ministry of Finance, planted about 10 
000 mangrove seedlings at Le Morne, a small fishing village 
in the south. The local community was actively involved. 
Cooperation included training on planting techniques by the 
Albion Fisheries Research Centre of the Ministry of Fisheries 
and Rodrigues. In 2011, multiple levels of cooperation and 
funding from a commercial bank under a corporate social 
responsibility scheme led to an additional 40 000 seedlings 
being planted. An island-wide survey has been undertaken to 
identify potential areas for replication.

Box 9.16 Social learning and knowledge in 
community-based adaptation strategies

The relative success of a community-based mangrove 
management project in Cameroon demonstrates the value 
of participation and learning for successful adaptation 
(Ajonina et al. 2009).

Communities of the Campo Beach raised over 4 000 mangrove 
seedlings in community-run nurseries and planted them as a 
green shield to protect Campo Beach from coastal erosion and 
wind. This project was a response to collapsing concrete walls 
along the beach. Dialogue, learning and inclusion in project 
development led to active community involvement in different 
aspects of the project, including seedling development, the 
demarcation of mangrove wood-gathering zones, locally based 
enforcement and continuous involvement in monitoring and 
evaluation. Locally appropriate technologies, including energy-
efficient fish-smoking houses, have been adopted.

and environmental aspects of the selected goals for biodiversity, 
freshwater, oceans and seas, and climate (Tables 9.1 and 9.2).

Africa has relied primarily on regulatory approaches to achieve 
pollution targets. These approaches influence environmental 
outcomes by regulating processes or products, limiting the 
discharge of specified pollutants, and restricting certain 
polluting activities to specific times or areas (Bernstein 1997). 
However, regulatory instruments are often inefficient in achieving

resources and the equitable sharing of related benefits. © Guenter Guni/iStock

pollution control objectives, especially where resources for 
monitoring pollution and compliance are lacking. The level of 
expenditure required for ensuring compliance with increasingly 
stringent environmental laws is an unmanageable cost for many 
governments. In contrast, stakeholder-driven management 
approaches have the potential to make pollution control 
economically advantageous to commercial organizations. These 
approaches can involve varying degrees of incentives, information 
and administrative capacity for effective implementation and 
enforcement. The principal types of economic instruments used 
for controlling pollution include pricing, pollution charging and 
marketable permits (Bernstein 1997).

Box 9.17 Managing acid mine drainage in the Olifants catchment

The upper Olifants catchment lies in the Gauteng and 
Mpumalanga provinces of South Africa, where coal mining, 
mineral processing and agriculture are key economic activities 
(Hob et al. 2008). The Olifants’ waters are polluted by acid 
mine drainage, particularly from coal mining. 

The controlled discharge scheme, introduced in the upper 
Olifants catchment in 1997 with the support of industrial 
stakeholders, takes advantage of the natural assimilative 
capacity of the river system during high flow conditions to 
control the discharge of acid mine drainage (Hob et al. 2008). 
The upper catchment is divided into management units, each 
with a distinct waste load allocation based on the assimilative 
capacity of the unit. Participating industries are allowed to 
discharge poor-quality water to the host management unit in 
proportion to the assimilative capacity of the unit and their 
share in the scheme (Limpitlaw et al. 2005).

The scheme has succeeded in reducing sulphate concentrations 
at the Witbank Dam (World Coal Institute 2002), which is expected 
to contribute to the ecological integrity of the river in the long run. 
Significantly, discharge during low-flow periods is reduced. Costs 
are borne by the polluter, ensuring that general tax can be put 
to other uses. Industries in the area including mines and power 
stations made significant capital and operational investments 
towards this project, with one company investing over R100 
million (US$13 million) in December 2007 for drainage, storage 
and treatment systems to improve the quality and quantity of its 
discharges (World Coal Institute 2002). The flood risk has been 
reduced and a healthier community is envisaged. 

Unfortunately, water quality problems in the Olifants catchment 
persist. Success for similar initiatives depends on strong 
institutional capacity, economic stability, government recognition of 
innovative ideas and the committed involvement of stakeholders.

Part 2: Policy Options

Box 9.17 on pollution control in the Olifants illustrates how 
stakeholder involvement can be successfully implemented 
and lead to a shift in established assumptions about where 
responsibility for pollution management lies.

CONCLUSION: BUILDING ON SUCCESS
This environmental policy appraisal suggests that opportunities 
for building on existing success can be effectively harnessed to 
ensure better implementation and positive outcomes for people 
and the environment.

Replicating and up-scaling effective approaches is important, 
but policies should not be blindly replicated, and should be 
modified to achieve good fit with local, national and regional 
conditions. As amply demonstrated in the policy options detailed 
above, it is important to maximize opportunities by focusing on 
options that are mutually reinforcing and cross-cutting (Table 
9.2). Finding and developing synergies is cost effective when 
financial and human resources are limited. Ensuring that policies 
are not in conflict with each other and that they do not lead to an 
externalization of adverse impacts is important.

As the policy appraisal shows, effective policy implementation 
requires reducing or removing barriers and strengthening 
enabling conditions. Insufficient monitoring, special-interest 
decision making, weak governance and rights, and a lack of 
adequate capacity have undermined policy success.

Policies that have in-built flexibility are needed to address 
environmental change. Investing in monitoring and evaluation, 
as well as social learning, supports revision and modification 
of policy responses, as illustrated in many of the policy options 
discussed here, including, for example, natural solutions for 
adaptation and mitigation. 

Decision making that is strategic and takes account of how 
changes in environmental use and governance affect the 
resilience of the social-ecological system has been shown to 
be effective in securing economic, social and environmental 
benefits. Integrating human and ecological understanding and 
priorities in environmental management can help ensure that 
choices do not destroy or undermine the environmental resources 
that underpin future options. Such approaches – including 
ecosystem-based management – prioritize the interface between 
people and nature and do not favour just one ecosystem 
component, industry sector, community or socio-economic 
group (Davis et al. 2011). Ecosystem-based management is one 
way to maintain the Earth System’s ability to adapt to change, 
as compared to other approaches that focus on fixed targets 
and state systems, or on hard-engineering solutions that often 
interfere with natural processes (Abdulla et al. 2011).

Strong accountability helps secure government and private-
sector commitment to implementation and to achieve agreed 
outcomes (Najam and Halle 2010) (see also the sections on 
local, inclusive and participatory approaches, human rights, and 
stakeholder pollution management). For countries to be better 

able to demonstrate results, systems for monitoring progress 
need to be established. Developing performance indicators 
rather than effort-based indicators, such as the number of 
meetings held, improves clarity about how and to what extent the 
purpose of the policy is being achieved (Najam and Halle 2010). 
Strong and effective national and sub-regional reporting systems 
help hold implementing agencies to account and provide an 
opportunity to document successes, which in turn set the basis 
for up-scaling and replication. 

Cooperation has been shown to be effective for achieving 
sustainable management, including policy options for 
transboundary coastal and land-based resource management, 
and where there are multiple stakeholders. This has improved 
equity, enhanced skills sharing and reduced conflict. In some 
cases, external support and collaboration with donors have 
helped establish effective platforms for engagement, learning 
and sharing knowledge and skills, including in TerrAfrica and 
under the Nairobi Convention. Partnerships with the private 
sector and environmental managers or custodians have been 
shown to be effective in securing benefits in many of the 
policy options, including payment for ecosystem services, and 
in mangrove restoration. Several of the options presented, 
including sustainable land management, show that a high degree 
of participation at local and government levels helps to ensure 
relevance, with good outcomes for strengthening sustainability. 
Decentralization and devolution policies, including in 
community-based resource management, have achieved positive 
outcomes for communities and for the environment.

Strengthening the governance and institutional regime for more 
equitable benefit sharing is critical, given that ecological and 
social resilience are tightly inter-twined, as South Africa’s basic 
water policy shows. Weak tenure and entitlements stand out as key

barriers to achieving equitable benefits for payment for ecosystem 
services including REDD+, community-based management and 
other policy options. While these are national problems, the 
scale and commonality of the challenges suggest that developing 
and adopting regional or global protocols for cooperation and 
sharing could provide the basis for more effective engagement and 
management of benefits and losses. Strengthening and integrating 
human rights perspectives in environmental management 

frameworks at national and regional levels supports more 
inclusive, long-term approaches by protecting livelihood rights, 
ensuring inclusion and reducing conflict. Regional human rights 
bodies can play an important role in solidifying the piecemeal 
environmental benefits that human rights recognition has already 
brought, especially where the mandate of regional courts and the 
rights of citizens to bring actions are strengthened, as shown in 
the human rights policy option.

Environmental policy is often out of step with realities on the 
ground, with governments acting alone often unable to effect 
the necessary change. Innovative institutional arrangements for 
pooling financial resources, knowledge and capacity, however, can 
contribute to achieving environmental goals. Improving capacity 
and equity among diverse communities, including governments, is 
essential to support collaboration and to secure rights. The policy 
options demonstrate the potential of various strategies to enhance 
capacity (Figure 9.3). At regional and sub-regional levels, for 
example, mechanisms for sharing information and knowledge, as 
in the management of marine pollution, could be better utilized.

Addressing the barriers to sustainability and achieving the 
agreed environmental goals addressed in this chapter can 
create a springboard to improve environmental performance 
and to move from promising policies to successful policies. 
Strengthening environmental management can help protect 
the ecosystem goods and services on which development and 
human well-being opportunities are based and provide a basis 
for dealing with key challenges including food security, poverty, 
urbanization and climate change impacts.

Main Messages 

Achievement of global environmental goals 
substantially depends on coordinated policies and 
action in the Asia and Pacific region, often identified 
as the global engine of economic growth. The 
global drivers identified in Chapter 1 – in particular 
unsustainable economic growth, population 
increase, mass consumption and urbanization – 
pose clear challenges to the region’s sustainable 
development. It is therefore important that policy 
responses are designed to enable the best possible 
adaptation to pressures and impacts deriving from 
these drivers.

Water endowments range from the highly arid 
temperate zones and water-stressed small island 
states to Himalayan snowfields and abundant 
tropics, often alternating between drought and 
flood. Balancing water supply and demand through 
coordination between users, and improved water 
quality management, are essential to achieve global 
freshwater goals. Successful implementation of 
policies requires establishing a planning framework 
for adaptive and integrated management of water 
resources, under which appropriate pricing and 
multi-stakeholder participation are essential.

Asia and the Pacific is the fastest growing region in 
the world with the most rapidly rising emissions of 
greenhouse gases, and efforts to combat climate 
change must accelerate across the region if global 
efforts are to succeed. Under a business-as-usual 
scenario, the region will contribute approximately 
45 per cent of global energy-related carbon dioxide 
(CO2) emissions by 2030. However, intra-regional 
diversity is great, with China the world’s largest 
emitter, while most Pacific island nations are 
among the smallest. People from this region have 
the most to lose from global inaction as many of 
the countries most at risk from climate change 
are here. Mainstreaming adaptation concerns 
into development policies and plans, integrating 
climate change adaptation and disaster risk 
reduction, climate proofing infrastructure, and 
promoting ecosystem-based adaptation are key 
actions. Significant steps have been taken on both 
mitigation and adaptation, but much more needs 
to be done – and urgently – to achieve widespread 
low-carbon and climate-resilient societies.

The threat of species extinction is only partly 
addressed by global goals targeting a significantly 
reduced rate of biodiversity loss. Despite progress 
in expanding protected areas, conserving some 
species, addressing some direct drivers of 
biodiversity loss, and implementing community-
based management and innovative financing, the 
scale of efforts remains insufficient. In light of 
the recent Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic 
Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of 
Benefits Arising from their Utilization, access and 
benefit-sharing regimes also need to be developed.

As the Asia and Pacific region becomes wealthier 
it is facing a rapid increase in consumption 
and its principal side effect – waste. Effective 
implementation of the 3Rs approach – reduce, reuse, 
recycle – remains a key goal, although a mix of 
policies may be necessary to achieve the most cost-
efficient outcomes. Changing consumption patterns 
and behaviour, which reduces waste from the outset, 
lies at the core of an effective policy mix.

260 Part 2: Policy Options

Appropriate controls on chemical production and 
use, and the provision of safe alternatives as 
well as appropriate treatment facilities, are key 
policy concerns. As their use is increasing while 
their impacts remain poorly monitored and little 
understood, management of registration, monitoring, 
export and import as well as information sharing 
should be strengthened. Proactive measures on 
emerging contaminants are also necessary.

Governance improvements are critical to enhanced 
accountability as a means of achieving sustainable 
development. Integrating sustainability concerns 
across all policy areas, increased multi-stakeholder 
participation and capacity improvement can all 
enhance governance. Additionally, allocating authority 
to appropriate levels of government, improved 
monitoring and data collection, access to information 
and legal redress, as well as greening fiscal policy, 
have the potential to alter the drivers of environmental 
change and unsustainable development.

Recommendation of policies to accelerate 
achievement of the selected global goals remains 
difficult. There have been some successes in the 
region but gaps remain. Policy responses are 
beginning to shift from a focus on environmental 
impacts to addressing the key drivers through 
market- and information-based approaches. As 
many of the policy successes are due to the context 
in which they are implemented, transferring policies 
from one country to another, while often practised, 
requires careful analysis. Creating the necessary 
enabling environment may be as important as 
selecting the right mix of policies. 

Asia and the Pacific 

261

INTRODUCTION
The global drivers identified in Chapter 1 – in particular 
unsustainable economic growth, population increase, mass 
consumption and urbanization – pose clear challenges to 
sustainable development in Asia and the Pacific. It is therefore 
important that policy responses are designed to enable the best 
possible adaptation to the pressures and impacts deriving from 
these drivers.

The objectives of this chapter are to:
•	 document	the	chosen	priority	themes	and	goals;
•	 identify	the	wide	range	of	policies	that	have	been	applied	in	

the region to address these goals; 

•	 screen	these	options	according	to	their	effectiveness	and	

compile a shortlist of the most promising policies for further 
analysis; 

•	 document	successful	cases	where	these	policies	have	been	

implemented and appear to have made a contribution to 
achieving the global goals; 

•	 analyse	the	social,	environmental,	economic	and	political	

impacts of these priority policies; 

•	 examine	the	possibilities	and	prospects	for	replication	across	

national borders; and

•	 conclude	which	of	these	policies	and/or	which	combination	

of these policies should be implemented to accelerate 
achievement of the global goals. 

The chapter concludes with a synthesis of the benefits and 
limitations of the combined policy packages for each thematic 
area, an analysis of the enabling environment that needs to be 
created to allow the selected policies to flourish, and a set of 
conclusions directed towards the region’s decision makers.

POLICY APPRAISAL
While Part 1 of GEO-5 describes the state and trends of a 
multitude of environmental issues and challenges, the  
regional consultation selected five priority themes for their 
overarching characteristics. The five priority themes and related 
global goals for the Asia and Pacific region were chosen at 
the first regional consultation, held in Bangkok, Thailand in 
September 2010. Generally, the broadest goal was selected to 
allow all issues covered by other goals to be considered. This 
means that quantitative targets were not chosen, thus making 
any quantitative assessment of policy choices more difficult.  
The themes are relevant for all countries in the region, 
but specific countries may need to prioritize additional 
|environmental challenges. Policy responses regarding the 
selected themes provide insights on how country-specific 
challenges can be addressed.

Priority themes
Climate change
The priority concern for most countries in the region is how to 
build resilience, especially in the most vulnerable communities, to 
climate change impacts already set in motion by past greenhouse 
gas emissions. Parts of low-lying Pacific island countries may 
disappear entirely due to sea level rise (Nicholls et al. 2011; Nunn 

2009; Barnett and Adger 2003), extreme weather events are likely 
to become more frequent, and marine habitats such as coral reefs 
and mangroves are threatened by increased temperature and 
ocean acidification. 

Under a business-as-usual scenario, the region will contribute 
approximately 45 per cent of global energy-related carbon 
dioxide (CO2) emissions by 2030 (IEA 2010) and, by one 
estimate, more than 60 per cent of total global CO2 emissions 
by 2100 (Masui et al. 2011). However, intra-regional diversity 
is great – China is the world’s largest CO2 emitter while most 
Pacific island nations are among the smallest. Transport-related 
emissions are expected to increase by 57 per cent worldwide 
between 2005 and 2030, with China and India accounting 
for more than half of that increase (Leather et al. 2009). 
Nonetheless, there are encouraging signs on mitigation. At least 
ten countries in the region have voluntarily pledged greenhouse 
gas emission reductions, including Indonesia’s promise of a 
26 per cent CO2 reduction compared to business-as-usual by 
2020 (DNPI 2010), and China’s of a 40–45 per cent reduction 

Box 10.1 Selected climate change goal: United 
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 
Article 3 Paragraphs 1–3

The Parties should protect the climate system for the benefit of 
present and future generations of humankind, on the basis of 
equity and in accordance with their common but differentiated 
responsibilities and respective capabilities. Accordingly, the 
developed country Parties should take the lead in combating 
climate change and the adverse effects thereof.

The specific needs and special circumstances of developing 
country Parties, especially those that are particularly 
vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change, and of 
those Parties, especially developing country Parties, that 
would have to bear a disproportionate or abnormal burden 
under the Convention, should be given full consideration.

The Parties should take precautionary measures to 
anticipate, prevent or minimize the causes of climate change 
and mitigate its adverse effects. Where there are threats 
of serious or irreversible damage, lack of full scientific 
certainty should not be used as a reason for postponing such 
measures, taking into account that policies and measures 
to deal with climate change should be cost-effective so as to 
ensure global benefits at the lowest possible cost. To achieve 
this, such policies and measures should take into account 
different socio-economic contexts, be comprehensive, cover 
all relevant sources, sinks and reservoirs of greenhouse 
gases and adaptation, and comprise all economic sectors. 
Efforts to address climate change may be carried out 
cooperatively by interested Parties.

in CO2 per unit of gross domestic product (GDP) compared to 
the 2005 level by 2020 (Lommen 2011). With one of the world’s 
greatest potentials for mitigating CO2 emissions being reduced 
deforestation alongside improved land-use management (ADB 
2009a), Asia and the Pacific can make significant contributions 
to global efforts at climate change mitigation. Accessing climate 
funds to enable these contributions, however, is a major concern 
for developing countries in the region.
 
Although UNFCCC Article 3 was selected by the regional 
consultation, three other goals (UNFCCC Article 2, the Bali Action 
Plan and the Delhi Declaration) selected by the GEO High-Level 
Intergovernmental Advisory Panel were also considered because 
adaptation, mitigation, capacity building and financing need to 
be considered as an integrated package of policy measures. 

Biodiversity
The imminent threat of mass extinction of species, brought 
about by continuing habitat fragmentation, degradation and 
loss, overexploitation of resources, invasive alien species, 
illegal wildlife trade, pollution and climate change are priority 

environmental concerns in the Asia and Pacific region (Box 10.2). 
The Global Biodiversity Outlook 3 concluded that the 2010 goal 
of reversing biodiversity loss had not been achieved (CBD 2010). 
The Strategic Plan for Biodiversity for 2011–2020 embodying the 
Aichi Biodiversity Targets now provides the general framework for 
biodiversity conservation.

to be established.

Freshwater
As outlined in Part 1, the key environmental priorities in the 
water sector being faced by the region are the quantity and 
quality of water resources (Box 10.3), climate change, access to 
safe drinking water and transboundary issues. All of these key 
challenges are reflected in the selected goal.

The regional consultation also noted that JPOI Paragraphs 25d 
and 7a should be included in the assessment, as well as taking 
an innovative approach to links with other themes.

Box 10.2 Selected biodiversity goal: Convention on 
Biological Diversity Article 1

Box 10.3 Selected freshwater goal: Johannesburg 
Plan of Implementation Paragraph 26c

The objectives of this Convention, to be pursued in accordance 
with its relevant provisions, are the conservation of biological 
diversity, the sustainable use of its components and the 
fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising out of the 
utilization of genetic resources, including by appropriate 
access to genetic resources and by appropriate transfer of 
relevant technologies, taking into account all rights over those 
resources and to technologies, and by appropriate funding.

Improve the efficient use of water resources and promote 
their allocation among competing uses in a way that 
gives priority to the satisfaction of basic human needs 
and balances the requirement of preserving or restoring 
ecosystems and their functions, in particular in fragile 
environments, with human domestic, industrial and 
agriculture needs, including safeguarding the quality of 
drinking water.

The selected global goals are built around the concept of life-
cycle thinking. Hence the starting point for effective policies is 
to use demand management and resource efficiency to minimize 
waste generation and the use of hazardous chemicals. The 
region’s political recognition of the need to prioritize waste 
minimization and resource efficiency is not matched by policy 
implementation (APO 2007). Only weak efforts have been made 
to address the escalating use of resources and hazardous 
substances that eventually end up as waste and pollutants (UNEP 
2011; Shekdar 2009).

Environmental governance
Environmental governance functions through institutions, 
laws, norms and processes for collective decision making 
(Young 1992), and the region has a wide diversity of systems 
and mechanisms. However, many “remain centralized, expert-
driven, compartmentalized, and inflexible” (ESCAP/ADB/UNEP 
2012). A persistent problem is that, “many environmental laws, 
regulations, action plans and programmes [have not been] 
effectively implemented”, making greater progress necessary 
to achieve the selected global goal of good governance at local, 
national, regional and global levels (JPOI Paragraph 5).

Policy screening
As indicated in the GEO-5 Introduction, the first step in the policy 
analysis framework was to formulate a long list of policy options 
with the potential to accelerate achievement of the selected 
global goals, and then identify a few priority policies or policy 
clusters for further analysis.

In some cases, the long list of policy options was clustered into 
groups of policies with a common intent prior to screening, for 
ease of assessment and acknowledging that most policies are 
implemented as part of a complementary package rather than 
alone. While all the policies considered may have important 
contributions to make in certain circumstances, the priority 
policies in Table 10.1 are believed to be able to accelerate 
achievement of the selected global goals if implemented 
consistently across all countries in the region, bearing in mind 
specific national circumstances. Here, priority means that the 
policy or cluster of policies was selected for more detailed 
policy analysis rather than implying high priority for a specific 
country or sub-region.

Chemicals and waste
The chemicals and waste theme encompasses a range of 
interrelated issues, including the production and use of 
chemicals, hazardous waste, electronic waste, transboundary 
movement, product reuse, materials recycling and municipal waste 
management. During the regional consultations, JPOI Paragraph 23 
was selected as the overarching goal for the theme, although 
JPOI Paragraph 22 was considered equally relevant (Box 10.4).

Box 10.4 Selected goal for chemicals and waste: 
Johannesburg Plan of Implementation Paragraphs 
22 and 23 

Prevent and minimize waste and maximize reuse, recycling 
and use of environmentally friendly alternative materials, 
with the participation of government authorities and all 
stakeholders, in order to minimize adverse effects on the 
environment and improve resource efficiency, with financial, 
technical and other assistance for developing countries.

Renew the commitment, as advanced in Agenda 21, to 
sound management of chemicals throughout their life cycle 
and of hazardous wastes for sustainable development 
as well as for the protection of human health and the 
environment, inter alia, aiming to achieve, by 2020, that 
chemicals are used and produced in ways that lead to 
the minimization of significant adverse effects on human 
health and the environment, using transparent science-
based risk assessment procedures and science-based 
risk management procedures, taking into account the 
precautionary approach, as set out in principle 15 of the Rio 
Declaration on Environment and Development, and support 
developing countries in strengthening their capacity for the 
sound management of chemicals and hazardous wastes by 
providing technical and financial assistance.

Part 2: Policy Options

Policy analysis
The priority policies in Table 10.1 were subjected to further 
analysis of their environmental, social and economic benefits 
and limitations, drawing from the literature and experience 
of the experts, as well as from 18 case studies of policy 
implementation, a limited number of which are summarized 
here. The analysis of limitations is included because even 
successful policies may have side effects or unintended 
consequences that need to be understood and addressed 
during implementation and that may impede replication 
elsewhere. To illustrate how policy packages may be introduced 
in coordinated steps, a series of graphic representations 
(Figures 10.1–10.5) show:
•	 possible	time	frames:	short	term,	1–5	years;	medium	term,	

6–15 years; long term, 16 years or more; and 

•	 direct	policy	measures	that	are	intended	to	target	the	

immediate cause of the problem, ranging to indirect policy 
measures that help to achieve the selected goals by tackling 
related issues.

Climate change
The key element of the selected global goal for climate change 
(Box 10.1) is to take a precautionary approach to anticipate, 
prevent or minimize the causes of climate change and to mitigate 
its adverse effects (Figure 10.1). 

The clean energy policy cluster includes a renewable energy 
mandate and potentially carbon capture and storage, which, 
if and when the technology is proven, could contain the 
greenhouse gas emissions from the largest source – globally 12 
billion tonnes of CO2 per year by 2020 (McKinsey and Company 
2009). This cluster also has significant co-benefits such as 
improved air quality and health improvements, avoidance of 
environmental damage from mining and exploration for fossil 
fuels, improved energy security and new green job opportunities 
(Hughes 2011; Renner 2008), and may offer households and 
businesses opportunities to generate their own energy and 
supply the surplus to the grid (Palit and Chaurey 2011; USEPA 
2010). Potential limitations include non-climate-related negative

environmental impacts such as mining for rare earth metals; 
the competition between biofuels and food production and 
impacts on biodiversity; higher costs to end users; unproven 
technologies such as carbon capture and storage; and the 
impacts on businesses and employees in traditional fossil fuel 
energy production. 

The energy efficiency policy cluster is aimed at reducing energy 
demand through targeted efficiency improvements in buildings, 
transport and agriculture, globally representing 14 billion tonnes 
of CO2 per year by 2030 (McKinsey and Company 2009). The 
principal benefits are reduced operating and travel costs, health 
benefits from cleaner air, reduced traffic congestion following 
the growth of mass transit systems, and lower environmental 
impacts from low-tillage and other energy-saving agricultural 
practices. Limitations include the high initial costs of retrofitting 
buildings and introducing or expanding mass transit systems, 
high resettlement costs when people are displaced by the 
building of above-ground mass transit systems, and the potential 
lack of uptake of mass transit by car-owning urban households. 
Furthermore, energy efficiency improvements such as hybrid 
cars, while desirable, may be only temporary or partial due to 
widespread rebound effects whereby part of the efficiency gain 
is offset by increased energy use (UNEP 2011; Timilsina and 
Shrestha 2009). Inadequate public awareness and incomplete 
markets for energy efficiency are also barriers to greater market 
penetration (IEA 2007).

The technology policy cluster includes policies that promote 
technology transfer and diffusion such as technology transfer 
agreements, intellectual property rights waivers or buy-outs, 
and domestic research, all of which will also contribute to 
achieving a precautionary approach to combating climate change. 
This policy cluster will allow developing countries to leapfrog 
development stages and avoid the carbon-intensive trajectory 
of developed countries. It will improve human well-being, assist 
national development budgets by avoiding a lock-in to fossil-fuel-
intensive approaches, and build national capacity for research 
and development. As a political strategy, such an approach has 
few limitations, although some intellectual property holders may 
be resistant to waivers to maintain their global competitiveness, 
and may be disadvantaged by being pressured to release their 
rights at less than market value. Indeed, some research claims 
that stronger intellectual property rights increase international 
technology transfer (Branstetter et al. 2006). Technology transfer 
from developed to developing countries may not be effective if the 
latter have inadequate domestic capacity to apply the technology 
in terms of infrastructure, human and financial capital, and the 
appropriate institutional environment (Tan and Zhang 2010).

The financial policies cluster includes greenhouse gas emissions 
trading, the Kyoto Protocol’s Clean Development Mechanism, 
the Joint Implementation mechanism and the Adaptation 
Fund, amended tariffs and taxes such as feed-in tariffs, a 
carbon tax and an aviation tax, or elimination of subsidies that

promote fossil fuel use (Box 10.6) and of financial incentives 
that encourage inappropriate land use and forest loss. A 
carbon tax may allow governments to reduce other taxes or 
generate additional revenue streams to invest in sustainable 
development. Earmarked financing provides incentives for scaled 
up investment in low-carbon technologies by the private sector. 
Penalizing fossil-fuel-based industries through taxes and tariffs 
levels the playing field for emerging technologies. Potential 
limitations include intermediaries benefiting from carbon market 
initiatives rather than achieving low-carbon objectives. Global 
schemes such as the Clean Development Mechanism tend to be 
bureaucratic and cumbersome, and to benefit too few countries 
(de Lopez et al. 2009). Social impacts, particularly for the poor, 
may be high due to more costly goods and services unless 
these are offset by lifeline support measures or tax rebates. 
The distributional impacts of all financial measures need to be 
carefully analysed prior to adoption. 

The adaptation policy cluster anticipates the likely impacts 
already embedded in the climate system due to historical levels 
of greenhouse gas emissions and ensures that communities can 
adapt to inevitable changes (Box 10.7). Policies that facilitate 
adaptation include mandatory infrastructure design for future 
climates, or climate proofing; ecosystem-based adaptation in 
planning and zoning schemes; building climate resilience in 
agriculture, forestry and fisheries; and integrating climate change 
adaptation and disaster risk reduction (Srivastava 2011; Mimura 
et al. 2007). These policies have a range of co-benefits such as

biodiversity conservation, improved recreational opportunities 
and managed natural resource harvesting (ADB 2010). The 
main benefits are a lower incidence of death or injury from 
extreme storm events and droughts; reduced future economic 
and social costs; additional economic opportunities for the 

 Box 10.6 Removing fossil fuel subsidies in Asia and the Pacific

Several countries have begun to remove fossil fuel 
subsidies. China, for example, has attempted to bring 
domestic energy prices closer to global market levels as 
it moves from being largely self-sufficient in energy to 
being a major importer. In 2007, the country removed price 
controls for coal, and prices are now negotiated between 
coal producers and power companies. Crude oil prices and 
refined oil products now match international levels. In 2010, 
onshore natural gas benchmark prices rose by 25 per cent 
following increased gas transmission fees. Preferential 
tariffs for energy-intensive industries were eliminated and 
a three-tiered electricity pricing mechanism was introduced 
for residential use.

In 2010, India announced that petrol pricing would be market 
driven. Immediate price increases were announced for 
diesel, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and kerosene. Natural 
gas pricing reform in 2010 allowed state-run producers to 
sell natural gas from new fields at market prices instead 
of regulated rates, and the price of natural gas more than 
doubled. In the coal industry, price reforms are expected to 
bring domestic prices in line with imports, allowing for quality 
differences, which will increase electricity prices. 

Indonesia has long subsidized energy prices as a poverty 
support policy, with 19 per cent of the state budget devoted 
to energy subsidies. Subsidies are becoming increasingly 
targeted at specific groups and the range of subsidized 
fuels has declined. In 2010, Indonesia announced plans to 
eliminate energy subsidies by 2014; to phase out the use of 
kerosene in favour of LPG and to restrict subsidized fuel to 
motorcycles, public transport vehicles and older cars; and 
raised power tariffs by about 10 per cent. In 2010, Malaysia 
announced plans to reduce subsidies for petrol, diesel and 
LPG, while Pakistan plans to phase out electricity subsidies 
and has implemented a 20 per cent tariff increase. 

The expected benefits of these policies are to:
•	 reduce	the	burden	on	state	budgets;	
•	 prevent	use	of	public	funds	to	support	the	wealthiest	and	

largest energy consumers; 

•	 ensure	that	alternative	energy	sources	are	at	least	equally	

attractive to consumers; and 

•	 reduce	environmental	damage	and	contributions	to	climate	

change from excessive use of fossil fuels.

Box 10.7 Adaptation policies in the Maldives 

Although they are the smallest contributors of greenhouse 
gas emissions, small island states are among the most 
vulnerable to climate change impacts, especially sea  
level rise, ocean acidification and increased storm severity 
and frequency. For example, with more than half the 
settlements and most of the critical infrastructure of the 
Maldives within 100 metres of the coast, there is serious 
concern about projections that 85 per cent of the country 
could be below sea level by 2100 (Khan et al. 2002). 
Recognizing this threat, the Maldives was the first country 
to declare its intention to be carbon neutral by 2019 (UNEP 
2009a) and to view climate change as a critical national 
development challenge.

construction sector; higher property values in secure areas; 
and increased security and resilience of affected communities. 
Limitations include the environmental costs associated with 
large-scale infrastructure such as higher flood levees; social 
costs if communities or infrastructure need to be relocated away 
from vulnerable zones; investment costs in climate proofing 
and possible compensation costs for affected properties and 
companies; and the political costs of diverting funds to retrofit 
old and new infrastructure. 

The policy cluster on land management for carbon sequestration 
aims at reducing greenhouse gas emissions from unsustainable 
land-use practices, including forest loss, biomass decomposition 
after harvesting, peat fires and decaying drained peat soils, 
which may contribute 15–20 per cent of total global emissions 
(van der Werf et al. 2009; IPCC 2007; WRI 2005). In South East 
Asia, emissions from inappropriate land use and forest loss  
may account for as much as 75 per cent of the total from that  
sub-region, mostly from forest loss in Indonesia (ADB 2010).

Part 2: Policy Options

In response, the Seventh National Development Plan adopted a 
policy of identifying ten safer islands, future refuges for people 
displaced as a result of climate change. This policy includes 
high-cost infrastructure such as sea walls and desalination 
plants, and even artificial islands such as Hulhumalé in Malé 
Atoll. The government has also implemented a softer set of 
policy measures under the Integrating Climate Change Risks 
into Resilient Island Planning in the Maldives programme (GEF 
2009), which involves working with nature to increase resilience, 
including coastal afforestation, replenishing natural ridges, 
climate proofing drainage, coral reef propagation, mangrove 
planting and beach nourishment. Each island community is 
involved in choosing which measures are most appropriate. 

until 2100 would account for 12 per cent of the total emission 
reductions needed to stabilize atmospheric CO2 at 450 ppm  
(FAO 2010; Gullison et al. 2007). Protection of coastal wetlands 
and marine ecosystems can also mitigate emissions (Crooks  
et al. 2011). Principal benefits include the conservation and 
supply of ecosystem services such as biodiversity and water 
supply and quality; maintenance of indigenous cultural practices; 
soil conservation; and promotion of local livelihoods. Limitations 
include possible conflicts with other development objectives; 
impingement of local economic aspirations due to restrictions 
applied by protected area managers; and more costly land 
management practices.

Biodiversity
The selected biodiversity goal contains elements of conservation 
of biological diversity, sustainable use of its components, and 
the fair and equitable sharing of the benefits of using genetic 
resources (Box 10.2). 

The policy cluster for conservation of biodiversity promotes 
the creation of protected areas, including areas that connect 
landscapes and seascapes, through identifying areas of high 
but threatened biodiversity value and biodiversity corridors 
that link protected areas as a system. The notable progress 
in the establishment of terrestrial and marine protected areas 
reported in the Global Biodiversity Outlook 3 (CBD 2010)  
may be attributed to explicit policies on protected areas,  
with many countries in Asia and the Pacific using legislation  
to establish protected areas (CBD 2010). Existing policies  
on protected areas may need further improvement, yet they  
provide a good foundation for attaining the global objective  
of biodiversity conservation. Commitments like the Convention 
on Biological Diversity (CBD), the Ramsar Convention on 
Wetlands, the World Heritage Convention and new funding 
mechanisms often drive both the establishment and  
improved effectiveness of protected areas. A shift from  
revenue generation to a conservation policy mandate has 
effectively reduced associated illegal land-use change. 

Box 10.8 Pacific islands: locally managed marine areas 

Defying the current trend of habitat destruction, an 
outstanding example of community-based management of 
coastal resources comes from the South Pacific. In the past 
decade, more than 12 000 km2 have been brought under a 
community-based system of marine resource management 
known as locally managed marine areas. The initiative 
involves 500 communities in 15 Pacific island states and 
has helped achieve widespread livelihood and conservation 
objectives based on traditional knowledge, customary 
tenure and governance, combined with local awareness of 
the need for action and the likely benefits, including the 

recovery of natural resources, greater food security, and 
improved governance and health. In Fiji, for example, the 
results of implementing locally managed marine areas since 
1997 have included a 20-fold increase in clam density in 
areas where fishing is banned, an average 200–300 per 
cent increase in harvests in adjacent areas, a tripling of fish 
catches, and a 35–45 per cent rise in household incomes. 
Such initiatives have the potential to be widely replicated 
wherever the socio-cultural environment is appropriate.

Source: Govan et al. 2008

Challenges remain in ensuring that protected areas are part 
of an ecologically representative network, on land and at sea, 
and to provide effective protection for threatened and endemic 
species (ACB 2010). Many protected areas in Asia and the 
Pacific have communities within or on their periphery for whom 
formal recognition of stewardship, traditional livelihoods and 
conservation traditions is necessary. Formal recognition of 
indigenous and local community-conserved areas (Box 10.8) 
would increase the ecological coverage of legally protected areas 

and support community rights in protecting the sites. Possible 
limitations include competition with development objectives, 
difficulties in measuring the real values of conservation against 
development activities yielding shorter-term economic returns, 
and institutional and individual capacity to effectively enforce 
conservation laws.

Also covered under this policy cluster are regional cooperation 
initiatives on transboundary protected areas and biodiversity

corridors. Transboundary collaboration fosters the cooperation 
of national institutions to benefit multiple countries, as 
demonstrated by several examples involving cross-boundary 
interest in protecting areas with high levels of biodiversity 
such as the Greater Mekong sub-region, Terai Arc landscape 
in India and Nepal, Sulu-Sulawesi marine areas and the Coral 
Triangle. The benefits from this cooperation are an augmentation 
of national efforts, transfer of capacities across countries 
and twin conservation efforts involving several stakeholders 
across borders. The key challenges are sustainability, differing 
capacities of institutions involved and the political nature of the 
cooperation whenever sensitive sovereign issues arise.

The targeted species conservation policy cluster is intended to 
protect species such as tigers, elephants, pandas, saola – an 
extremely rare antelope discovered in Viet Nam and Laos in 
1994 (Schaller and Vrba 1996) – or other species of biological, 
economic, spiritual and cultural importance, including species 
covered by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered 
Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). These policies protect 
species from capture and hunting, being kept as pets or being 
traded for medicinal or food purposes, as well as promoting 
their well-being in captivity, such as in wildlife parks or zoos. The 
policies not only protect valuable species but also help to spread 
a broader conservation message of the need to conserve species

and their habitats. Charismatic species also act as rallying points 
for political support, promote nature-based tourism and help 
leverage resources for broader institutional support. The main 
limitations are that there may be too much attention on such 
individual species, drawing support away from others in their 
native habitat. 

Invasive alien species, especially in island ecosystems with high 
endemism, are a major threat to species conservation. Apart from 
national quarantine processes and regional networks like the 
Asia-Pacific Forest Invasive Species Network, control mechanisms 
are limited. However, there have been a few cases of successful 
eradication of invasive alien species in the region (GISP 2009).

The illegal wildlife trade policy cluster, based around CITES, 
is intended to eliminate the illegal wildlife trade, including by 
strengthening border controls and training customs officials to 
recognize endangered species, and through campaigns to raise 
awareness and publicity surrounding successful enforcement 
cases (ASEAN-WEN 2009). Benefits include the protection of 
natural assets and saving certain species from extinction. There 
are also significant co-benefits in the form of improving law and 
order generally (as wildlife crime is often associated with other 
criminal activities), improved governance structures and better 
response mechanisms for wildlife protection within national 
borders. The main limitations are the need for heavy investment 
in law enforcement, possibly denying the customary rights of 
indigenous communities to access non-timber forest products, 
and possible social conflict where bushmeat is an accepted 
social norm and a significant source of protein (van Vliet 2011). 

The community management policy cluster includes co-
management, stewardship of traditional owners, recognition 
of property-use rights, and policies establishing various 
sustainable forest and fisheries management schemes. Benefits 
include better conservation outcomes, expanded livelihood 
opportunities, income diversification, poverty reduction, reduced 
tension between state and citizen, and better governance and 
institutional reform (Box 10.8). Potential limitations are the 
capture of economic benefits by an elite, exclusion and conflicts 
within communities, and a need for both long-term investment 
and capacity building. 

The policy cluster on innovative financing mechanisms provides 
incentives for communities to remain engaged in conservation 
and institutionalizes their involvement. Countries testing 
innovative financing mechanisms like payment for ecosystem 
services under a green growth paradigm are increasing (Box 10.9). 
Nature-based solutions to climate change – such as Reducing 
Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) – 
offer potential for social and biodiversity co-benefits by avoiding 
land-use change, which is the major driver of biodiversity loss in 
the tropics (Chapter 1). Challenges to mainstreaming economic 
instruments for conservation remain in terms of high resource 
degradation and increasing pressure, as well as difficulties in 
streamlining supportive policy and legal regimes, institutional 
mechanisms, and equity and rights of the community.

Box 10.9 Promoting sustainable use of biodiversity: payment for ecosystem services in China and Viet Nam

China: A national environmental policy framework that 
promotes eco-compensation as a key principle aims to 
promote sustainable use of natural resources and more 
balanced growth across regions. China has been implementing 
some of the largest payment for ecosystem services schemes 
in the world. For example, more than US$15 billion has been 
spent since 1999 on the conversion of cropland to forest and 
grasslands. This programme pays farmers to withdraw land 
from agricultural use and afforest or plant grasses on sloping 
and marginal cropland covering more than 9 million hectares. 
Similarly, almost US$2 billion has been invested in a forest 
ecosystems compensation fund, which pays households, 
communities and local governments to protect key forest 
areas, now covering 44 million hectares. The success of these 
schemes has created a healthy debate in the government on 
how to make improvements and has provided the impetus 
for exploring and developing other market-based tools and 
innovations to address the country’s challenge of balancing 
growth with environmental concerns. Recently, the government 
has called for emission-fee reforms for key natural resources, 
improved resource taxation and fees for mineral resource 
use, which will expand the horizon for eco-compensation 
mechanisms. These policy experiences are contributing to the 
drafting of a national law on the eco-compensation framework. 

Viet Nam: Under funding from the US Agency for International 
Development’s Regional Development Mission for Asia, the 
Asia Regional Biodiversity Conservation Programme has 
implemented a successful pilot project on payment for forest 
environmental services in Lam Dong Province, which has 

improved the livelihoods of 40 000 rural poor and promoted 
biodiversity conservation while informing the design and 
subsequent issue of a national decree on such schemes. The 
decree creates the legal framework for integrating the value 
of ecosystem services in two pilot areas – Lam Dong and 
Son La provinces. The policy facilitates payment for forest 
management while improving the incomes of the communities 
that provide those management services.

The buyers of the forest services are the electric and water 
utilities paying for water regulation and soil conservation, 
and tourism operators paying for the landscape amenity. 
The Lam Dong pilot area involves high-priority conservation 
areas in Cat Tien National Park and Bi Doup-Nui Ba National 
Park, as well as providing a link to the Dong Nai River Basin 
Conservation Landscape. By December 2010, payments of 
more than US$4 million for the protection of 210 000 hectares 
of forest had been made to 22 forest management boards and 
forestry businesses as well as to 9 870 predominantly ethnic-
minority households, each of which receives US$540–615 
annually. Forest protection patrols supported by the scheme 
resulted in half the number of cases of illegal logging and 
wildlife poaching in one priority watershed area. Replication of 
this approach throughout Viet Nam would make a significant 
difference in the incentives to retain forest habitats and protect 
biodiversity, especially if the pool of buyers of ecosystem 
services can be expanded – for example to those investing in 
carbon sequestration through carbon offsets.

The policy cluster on access and benefit sharing for the equitable 
use of genetic resources includes recognition of the rights of 
indigenous stewards of ecosystems, intellectual property rights 
protection and regulations preventing biopiracy. The policy 
cluster draws heavily on the outcome of CBD negotiations on 
access and benefit sharing, notably the Bonn Guidelines (CBD 
2002) and the subsequent international regime. Adoption of the 
Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and 
Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilization (CBD 
2011) will guide the ongoing effort for developing national and 
regional agreements. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations 
(ASEAN) draft agreement on Access to Biological and Genetic 
Resources, combined with draft policies and laws on access to 
genetic resources, benefit sharing and traditional knowledge 
in Bangladesh, Cambodia, Mongolia, Nepal and Sri Lanka, will 
provide additional incentives for implementation.

The principal benefits of these policies include providing an 
additional incentive for indigenous communities dependent on 
natural resources to maintain a full range of biological diversity, 
a fair and equitable return from investors that stand to make 

a profit from capitalizing on indigenous knowledge and/or 
stewardship, and a means for governments to protect a national 
heritage. The main limitations are the difficulties in identifying 
communities practising traditional knowledge, and its objective 
validation both for effective rewards and for overcoming potential 
constraints on voluntary research. 

Freshwater
The global goal on freshwater selected for Asia and the Pacific 
targets improvement of water allocation, conservation of both 
the quantity and quality of water resources, and the safeguarding 
of ecosystems (Box 10.3; Figure 10.3). These could be achieved 
by systematic promotion and application of integrated water 
resources management as a policy-planning framework. 

The concept of integrated water resources management has been 
in place for almost 30 years and many countries have tried to set 
up institutional frameworks for it. In practice, however, only a 
handful of countries in the region have established the necessary 
legal and institutional capacities for its implementation 
(UNESCO-WWAP 2006). In most countries, organizational

reform has involved setting up apex water bodies and river 
basin organizations to implement the integrated approach. 
However, water resources are still managed primarily through 
a sectoral approach in which policy is shaped by each agency 
in charge, often without cross-sectoral coordination and with 
occasional tensions (Molle and Hoanh 2009; Bandaragoda 
2006). The application of integrated management can contribute 
to sustainable water resource use by integrating and balancing 
human needs with conservation and the restoration of 
ecosystems, and will enable the region to cope with complex 
and unpredictable challenges such as future climate change 
impacts related to changing patterns of extreme events including 
droughts and tropical cyclones (typhoons) (Chapter 4).

The water allocation and cooperation policy cluster aims to 
achieve an acceptable balance between potentially competing 
water uses and involves enhanced conflict management and 
cooperation capacities. Typical policies may involve assigning 
existing local communities to implement water resources 
management, establishing water users’ associations or river 
basin organizations with explicit mandates to manage potential 
conflicts, using multi-stakeholder participation to draw up 
basin development plans, or setting up conflict resolution 
panels. Cooperation institutions established in river basins have 
helped to reduce potential water related conflicts in Central 
Asia (Abdullaev and Atabaeva 2011). For example, the inclusion 
of water users in the canal water management system in the 

Fergana Valley of Central Asia improved transparency and more 
equitable water distribution (Abdullaev et al. 2009a, 2009b; 
Dukhovny et al. 2008; Abdullaev et al. 2006). In Australia, 
the Murray-Darling agreement and its implementing agency is 
another example of basin-level institutional arrangements that 
have been emulated in other countries.
 
The pioneering of community-based participatory irrigation 
management in Andhra Pradesh, India shows the importance 
of water users’ associations in leading such initiatives (Gupta 
2010; Narain 2003; Ballabh 2002; Mollinga 2001; Parthasarathy 
2000; Shashidharan 2000). While the policy has not been an 
unqualified success, a state-level federated structure of users’ 
associations was created, followed by district- and farmer-level 
organization structures with well-defined mandates, transparent 
systems and people-centred decision making. At the local 
scale, these policies have contributed to increased financial 
capacity through revenue generation from the group members 
and the incorporation of a watershed management approach. 
The main limitations have been difficulties in scaling up from 
a pilot project level due to resistance from those who were 
benefiting from the status quo, prolonged water scarcity, and 
unsustainable institutional arrangements once external project 
funding came to an end. 

The basic human needs policy cluster relates to satisfying

Box 10.10 Uzbekistan: improving the capacity of 
existing reservoirs in Central Asia

Irrigation is the primary consumer of water in arid countries. 
In Central Asia it underpins economic development, 
employment and food security, with reservoirs playing an 
important role in making it possible. More than 250 large 
reservoirs with a total volume of more than 163 km3 were 
constructed in the region from 1950 to 1990, but most 
are now silted up. To improve capacity, a state agency in 
Uzbekistan formulated a policy option to study and de-
silt existing reservoirs. This has so far allowed savings of 
US$250 000 and helped to increase reservoir volume by up 
to 10 per cent. The policy has now been adopted as standard 
procedure by the Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources.

increasing the volume of stored water along with the resulting 
flexibility in use. Policies include planning guidelines to store 
urban storm water run-off for watering public gardens or for 
street cleaning, or requiring buildings above a certain size to 
store water collected on the roof. Rainwater harvesting is already 
included in national and local policies in some countries such 
as Sri Lanka (Government of Sri Lanka 2007), Australia (Meinzen 
2009) and in some states of India (Rainwater Harvesting 
Organization 2011). Support for construction of farm dams and 
renovating existing dams to extract greater volumes of water 
through application of new technologies are feasible policy 
options (Box 10.10). National policies on the construction of 
large water storage facilities for flood control, hydropower and 
irrigation have potential immediate benefits, but often induce 

concerns over environmental and social impacts (WCD 2000).
The water-use efficiency policy cluster promotes the application 
of economic instruments, especially in urban areas, including 
graduated pricing based on the type of water use and volume, 
pollution charges and combined payments for water and 
sanitation. The benefits of economic instruments include 
behavioural change inducing water saving by users, increased 
revenue for social measures and the operation and maintenance 
of the water supply. Experience from Cambodia and the 
Philippines shows that it is possible to improve access to safe 
drinking water significantly in cities and rural areas (IFAD 2011; 
ADB 2009c). The principal limitations are the difficulties of 
making water a priced service rather than a free good, higher 
management costs, potential cost burdens on some users, shifts 
to non-priced water resources such as groundwater, unpopularity 
with politicians who are reluctant to impose new charges and 
delays in effective institutionalization. Reducing the use of 
un-priced water is a way of improving water-use efficiency but it 
needs investment and staff capacity development (Frauendorfer 
and Liemberger 2010). Manila Water and the Phnom Penh Water 
Supply Authority have significantly reduced un-priced water use 
through management improvements (ADB 2009c).

The water environment policy cluster includes strengthening 
legislation and the implementation of water quality management 
by ensuring regular monitoring and reporting, applying the 
polluter-pays principle through pollution fees, incorporating 
total pollution load control systems, and mandating treatment 
levels for different categories of wastewater. The promotion of 
industrial and domestic wastewater treatment also contributes 
to improving water quality. Public communication strategies 
such as a water quality index should also be considered as a 
way of drawing attention to changes in water quality. The main 
benefit is that sufficient water of the desired quality becomes 
available, thus reversing current trends. Improved water quality 
reduces health risks and helps achieve one of the Millennium

Box 10.11 The Yellow River, China: balancing environmental and human needs through quotas and pricing reform 

Several provinces share water from northern China’s Yellow 
(Huang) River. The river began exhibiting a partial failure 
to reach the sea in 1972 and continuous interruption was 
observed after 1987. The annual frequency of cut-off days 
reached its peak of 226 days in 1997, and the severe 
reduction in flow impaired the ecosystem health of the river 
basin as well as its services to society. 

In 1998, the National Development and Reform 
Commission, formerly the State Development Planning 
Commission, and the Ministry of Water Resources issued 
annual water-use quotas and a distribution scheme for 
the river, as well as the Implementation Regulation for 
Water Resource Allocation among Provinces in the Huang 
River Basin. These management policies determined total 
water withdrawals on the basis of hydrology, the need 
for sediment transport and other ecological factors, and 
established annual provincial water withdrawals including 
a seasonal distribution plan for greater withdrawal in the 
rainy season than in the dry season.

In March 1999, the Yellow River Water Conservancy 
Commission issued the first water withdrawal quota 

directive and started the water withdrawal control plan 
for the whole basin. This policy was extended from the 
main Yellow River to its tributaries in 2006. In the same 
year, the State Council issued Water Withdrawal and 
Water Resource Fee Collection Rules, marking a new 
chapter in water management policy based on economic 
measures such as water pricing and resource fees. 
Trade in water user rights between various sectors was 
observed in some provinces.

Implementation of these policies has ensured 
uninterrupted flow of the river to the sea since 2000 and 
improved the water resource and ecological health of the 
whole basin. Ecosystem integrity and biological diversity 
have improved greatly. Rare species have reappeared, with 
the number of bird species in Shandong Yellow River Delta 
National Nature Reserve rising from 187 in 2000 to 283 
by 2006. Populations of rare and endangered plant and 
animal species in the Shell and Wetland System Nature 
Reserve doubled over the same five-year period.

Development Goals. The benefits to industry and the water 
supply sector are lower water treatment costs. Limitations 
include the high wastewater treatment costs and the difficulty 
in convincing polluters, especially marginal small to medium-
sized enterprises, to undertake the necessary control measures 

voluntarily, thus requiring resolute implementation of the 
polluter-pays principle and command-and-control regulations. 
Ensuring environmental flow, which requires a high level of 
political commitment, is also important for the health of water 
bodies (Box 10.11). 

Chemicals and waste
The global goal for chemicals and waste focuses on life-cycle 
analysis, transparency and risk assessment for a participatory 
approach to minimize risks to human health and the environment 
(Box 10.4; Figure 10.4).

The Asia and Pacific region is facing rapidly growing challenges 
in waste and chemicals management, fuelled by the region’s 
combination of strong economic growth and population increase, 
and its rapid industrialization and urbanization. In low- and 
middle-income countries in particular, volumes of waste are 
growing and waste streams are becoming increasingly complex, 
containing ever larger amounts of hazardous substances (Harhay 
et al. 2009). The capacity to collect and properly treat this 
waste is lagging, with consequent impacts on human health 
and the environment. Similarly, the use of agricultural and 
industrial chemicals and the unintended generation of hazardous 
substances are escalating, leading to impacts that are currently 
poorly monitored and therefore little understood.

Box 10.12 Phase-out of ozone-depleting substances in India

Over the past two decades, the government of India has 
undertaken a number of policy measures to encourage 
technologies that do no damage to the ozone layer. These 
include licensing the export and import of ozone-depleting 
substances (ODS); granting duty exemptions for goods needed 
to comply with the Montreal Protocol’s Multilateral Fund, 
under which India is entitled to assistance for phasing out ODS 
and switching to technologies that do not depend on such 
substances; and stopping investment in new projects that 
make use of them. 

As a producer and user of seven of the 20 substances controlled 
under the Montreal Protocol, India acceded to the treaty in 
1992. In 1993, India prepared a detailed country programme 
to phase out ODS and subsequently updated the programme in 
2006 in consultation with the Confederation of Indian Industry 
and other stakeholders. In 1997, India was producing almost 
40 000 tonnes of ODS, primarily the chlorofluorocarbon CFC-12 
and carbon tetrachloride (CTC), with domestic consumption 
estimated at 14 000 tonnes. By 1999, some 226 projects  
had been approved by the Multilateral Fund at a cost of  
US$58 million and estimated to remove 7 682 tonnes of ODS 
from the aerosol, foam, halon, air conditioning and solvent 

industries. As of 2010, India had successfully phased out 
the production and consumption of CFCs, CTC and halons as 
specified by the Montreal Protocol and excepting the use of 
pharmacy-grade CFCs for respiratory ailments. A complete, 
step-wise phase-out was proposed for all ODS by 2040.

The successful phase-out of ODS in India, as well as being 
attributed to the above policy provisions, is also associated 
with the creation of a national ozone cell and an empowered 
steering committee supported by a technology and finance 
standing committee and a standing committee on monitoring. 
Other factors included involving Indian industry from the 
beginning and awareness campaigns for the general public 
and affected industries. A detailed monitoring mechanism was 
set up and the ozone cell in the national environment agency 
conducted site inspections and ensured that funds were used 
appropriately, timely progress reports were submitted, and the 
intended impacts were being achieved. Similar success stories 
from other countries in the Asia and Pacific region suggest 
that India’s policy approaches for implementing the Montreal 
Protocol are readily transferable.

take a relatively long time to realize its full potential. Effective 
solutions to the challenges of waste and chemicals require 
preventive approaches. Substances with hazardous properties 
need to be phased out and replaced with safer options as 
far as possible. Production systems and products need to be 
redesigned with their full life cycle in mind, minimizing resource 
consumption, chemical hazards and waste generation. Overall, 
there is a need to encourage more sustainable patterns of 
consumption that can deliver quality of life with the minimum 
environmental burden.

Several actions towards this objective are already being 
taken. Green public procurement has proven an effective 
tool for creating a market for improved products, including 
those made of recycled materials (FOEN 2008). Extended 
producer responsibility for electronics has promoted 
design changes and fostered closer collaboration between 
manufacturers and recyclers. A good example of chemical 
substitution has been the phasing out of ozone-depleting 
substances under the Montreal Protocol on Substances that 
Deplete the Ozone Layer (Box 10.12). Waste avoidance has 
had some success for industrial waste but has proven more 
challenging for household waste.

The principal benefits of such policies include minimizing the 
need for waste treatment and chemical safety measures, and a 
reduction in both illegal waste dumping and pollution. The main 
limitation is that some companies may have to internalize costs 

that they were previously able to shift to the public domain, 
although evidence suggests that taking a life-cycle approach can 
often also reduce production costs (Barringer 2003).

The policy cluster on collection systems and treatment facilities 
aims to ensure that, once products are in circulation, priority 
is given to reuse and recycling, with energy recovery and safe 
disposal as less desirable options. Industrial and municipal 
solid wastes pose different challenges and require different 
approaches, although there may be synergies in combined 
treatment. Effective policy interventions need to cover all stages, 
including efficient collection systems, safe treatment facilities 
and functioning markets for recovered materials. The cost of 
establishing systems of a high environmental standard may 
seem challenging, but the cost of inaction is also significant. 
Effective technologies are widely available, including both high-
tech solutions and systems based on traditional practices. In 
Japan, for example, more than 50 million tonnes of solid waste 
are burned every year, often generating electricity and providing 
district heating. In 2000, Japan set a target to reduce dioxin 
emissions from incinerators by about 92 per cent from 1997 
levels – a target achieved by 2003, with over 2 000 industrial 
waste incinerators shut down. The revised target in 2003 was to  
achieve a further reduction of 30 per cent by 2010 (MOEJ 2007; 
 JFS 2005). The Republic of Korea has been particularly successful 
in introducing source separation of food waste for separate 
treatment, a policy that has significantly reduced the emissions 
of greenhouse gases from waste treatment (Lee 2006). 
Community-based composting has also been successfully 
introduced in many cities across Asia and the Pacific, reducing 
disposal needs and the associated costs for municipalities 
(ESCAP/IGES 2011).

The principal benefits of these policies include the obvious direct 
environmental and health benefits as well as the longer-term 
indirect and/or cumulative impacts of lower concentrations of 
toxic and hazardous materials. The main limitations of recycling 
have been associated with finding markets for recovered 
materials, leading to diminished private-sector enthusiasm after 
an initial period.

The international collaboration policy cluster addresses the 
need for a joint approach to meeting challenges as the region’s 
countries become more integrated (Aziz 2010; Nag 2010). This 
is particularly relevant to waste and chemicals, since end-of-life 
products and recyclable materials are increasingly traded across 
borders (Box 10.13), and many chemical pollutants, such as 
persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and mercury, can spread 
far from their sources. Developing countries and economies in 
transition are facing particular challenges in formulating and 
implementing effective policies to address these problems: 
international collaboration can provide the technical and financial 
resources needed. Regional monitoring systems for chemicals in 
the environment such as the POPs Global Monitoring Programme 
have been instrumental in identifying pollution sources for the 
formulation of effective action (UNEP 2008a). 

The benefits of these policies depend on the form of 
collaboration. Strengthening the technical and governance 
capacity for waste and chemicals has obvious and direct 
benefits for human health and the environment. Effective and

Box 10.13 Ship breaking in South Asia: implementing a new international environmental agreement

Normally, recycling of materials is regarded as an 
environmental benefit, but in some cases, such as ship 
breaking and recycling of e-waste and batteries, the long-term 
exposure and labour-intensive methods used in developing 
countries result in negative local impacts on the environment 
and human health. Since the 1980s, the global centre of 
ship dismantling and recycling has been South Asia, with 
Bangladesh, India and Pakistan accounting for 70–80 per cent 
of the international market. The industry not only provides 
large volumes of recycled iron and steel, plus other materials, 
but also creates jobs for thousands of workers from the 
poorest segments of the population. The direct and indirect 
beneficiaries in Bangladesh alone are estimated to be half a 
million people. The majority of workers are young, male and 
functionally illiterate, often living in cramped shacks near the 
recycling yards, thus adding to health concerns.

Obsolete ships contain a wide range of hazardous materials 
for which there are no adequate treatment facilities or 
occupational health and safety measures in the South Asian 
yards. Ship breaking is regarded as a “pollution haven” 
industry, often seeking out jurisdictions with lax environmental 
controls. However, in 2009, the Bangladesh High Court 
directed that all ship breaking yards without Department of 
Environment clearance should close within two weeks, and 

ordered new rules to be formulated requiring all ship breaking 
yards to obtain an environmental clearance certificate.

In recognition of these environmental dangers, the 
International Convention for the Safe and Environmentally 
Sound Recycling of Ships (the Hong Kong Convention) was 
adopted in May 2009 and is expected to come into force in 
2015. A key requirement is to remove hazardous materials 
before recycling commences. The Hong Kong Convention 
will require signatories to ensure that ships are recycled 
only in countries that are a party to the convention, and 
in facilities that meet its work safety and hazardous waste 
handling requirements. An inventory of hazardous materials 
will need to be completed by the ship owner and provided 
to the recycler, so that the ability to handle the wastes can 
be checked. The convention will also specify that certain 
hazardous materials should not be used in the construction 
of new ships, thus avoiding these problems when the newer 
generation of ships is scrapped.

The convention will require South Asian nations to revise 
their legislation and invest heavily in improved procedures, 
equipment and facilities if they want to continue this business.

safe treatment of hazardous materials can be ensured if these 
operations are carried out in countries with adequate capacity 
and if shipments to other countries are prevented. Enhanced 
international information sharing enables traceability and 
effective preventive action, including strengthened control of 
transboundary movements. 

Environmental governance
The global goal on governance relates to strengthening the 
multiple dimensions of sustainable development (Box 10.5). 
Four key policy clusters were identified that could accelerate 
its achievement (Figure 10.5). Capacity development, access to 
education and information remain as underlying enabling factors 
for the effectiveness of each policy cluster.

The policy integration and mainstreaming cluster aims to 
integrate sustainable development functions, which are 
commonly fragmented between different ministries and agencies 
with weak coordination. Increased policy integration and 
strengthening the capacity of environment and related ministries 
and agencies at different levels of government can promote 
win-win opportunities for environment and development. This 
integration would not only strengthen the organizational capacity 
and decision-making influence of environment ministries, 
but also enhance accountability regarding the potential 
environmental and social impacts of development projects. 

Integration can be supported through impact assessment and 
monitoring as well as mainstreaming mitigation measures.

Some degree of mainstreaming is practised by Australia, China, 
Japan, New Zealand and the Republic of Korea (Box 10.14). 
Benefits include a more inclusive policy making process, 
greater coherence of policies and improved implementation. 
Environmental agendas, however, can be watered down by 
other stakeholders, and sectoral ministries are not always 
keen to promote the development projects with the least 
environmental impacts.

In some cases, achievement of global sustainability goals can 
be accelerated by allocating authority at more appropriate levels 
(Berger and Steurer 2009), for example through decentralization 
and the introduction of participatory approaches in natural 
resource management (Box 10.15). Delegation of authority 
needs to be linked with appropriate budget authority, human 
resources, capacity building and reporting mechanisms to ensure 
effectiveness and public support (Jordan and Lenschow 2009).

The Republic of Korea has formulated a National Strategy for 
Green Growth with an overall vision of becoming a global green 
leader by 2020, focusing on the following broad objectives: 
mitigation of climate change and energy independence, 
creation of new engines for economic growth, improvement in 
quality of life and enhancement of international standing. The 
strategy is supported by a Green Growth Framework Act and a 
five-year action plan with targets for greenhouse gas emission 
reductions, carbon absorption by forests and afforestation. 

The National People’s Congress has set China on a more 
sustainable and low-carbon development path through the 12th 
Five-Year Plan for National Economic and Social Development 
(2011–2015). Among its binding targets are a 16 per cent 

reduction in energy intensity, a 17 per cent reduction in carbon 
intensity, a 6 per cent increase in forest stock volume and a 
1.3 per cent increase in forest coverage relative to 2010 levels 
(Lommen 2011). China’s National Development and Reform 
Commission plays a crucial role in fostering policy integration.

The green growth approach (ESCAP 2005) is an initiative from 
this region that works to integrate environmental sustainability 
concerns into overall policy making. It aims to improve the eco-
efficiency of economic growth, minimizing resource use and 
negative environmental impacts. The concept is seen as a key 
strategy for sustainable development.

In India, about 22 million hectares of forests are under the 
Joint Forest Management programme, where more than 
100 000 committees formed by forest-fringe communities 
protect state-owned forest patches, receiving in turn a 
share of forest resources (MOEF 2009a). In conjunction 
with stringent legislation against the use of forest land 
for non-forestry purposes, these measures have helped 
stabilize forest cover after decades of rapid deforestation 
(MOEF 2009b). Additional incentives for participation have 
been created by a constitutional amendment that mandates 
decentralization and devolution of power to local authorities 
at district, block and village levels (MLJ 2011). In Nepal, 
over 14 000 community forest user groups have access to 
fuelwood and fodder, and are additionally provided with 
income-generating opportunities (DoF 2011). 

policies, plans and programmes all provide essential information 
(World Bank 2006). Ultimately, fully integrated sustainability 
assessment is desirable (UNEP 2009b). Benefits include reduced 
risk of harm to human health or livelihoods due to environmental 
damage, protection of resources and improved cost-effectiveness 
of environmental protection measures. Moreover, reduced future 
remediation costs, political acceptance of the need for preventive 
and remedial measures, and better institutional collaboration are 
also beneficial. Assessments have some technical limitations as 
results are not always well used, and stakeholder participation 
is sometimes weak; impact assessments are only effective if 
governments commit to ensuring compliance and enforcement of 
the changes indicated.

The policy cluster for strengthening incentive structures focuses 
on appropriate pricing mechanisms. The current fiscal incentive 
structure in many countries does not account for environmental 
and social externalities and remains a significant barrier to 
sustainability. Improving the fiscal incentive structure can help 
accelerate greening of the economy to advance the dual goals of 
economic development and environmental sustainability (OECD 
2011; ESCAP 2010, 2005). Implementation of green taxes can 
secure a double dividend for the economy and the environment 
by emphasizing a shift from taxing the “goods” (labour) to 
taxing the “bads” (unsustainable resource use and pollution) 
(UNEP 2011; ESCAP 2005). Such a shift would help alter the 
economic incentive structure in favour of environment-friendly 
activities, thus reducing trade-offs between economic efficiency 
and maintenance of environmental quality. To be successful, it 
needs to be implemented as a package and to include awareness 
campaigns for political acceptability as well as adequate 
safeguards for vulnerable groups.

The accountability and stakeholder participation cluster 
addresses the task of integration, which is underpinned by 

the collection, storage and sharing of information as well as 
general access to it, such as requiring industries to self-monitor 
and self-report on environmental and social performance as 
well as enabling non-governmental organizations to monitor 
this information independently. Policy options mandating 
environmental monitoring provide useful information for decision 
making. Freedom of information laws can enable people to 
monitor public- and private- sector performance and demand 
compliance and enforcement action, such as promoted by the 
Asian Environmental Compliance and Enforcement Network 
(AECEN 2011b). Access to information promotes public 
participation in decision making, helping to avoid mistakes and 
future costs, and increasing political acceptance of remediation 
measures. Information disclosure policies provide a sound 
basis for decision making, identifying priorities and formulating 
cost-effective strategies. Limitations include the difficulties in 
collecting relevant and reliable data, potential sensitivities in 
data sharing and the long-term costs of data management.

Policies that require multi-stakeholder participation are also 
essential to accelerate achievement of the selected global goals. 
The benefits of multi-stakeholder participation include improved 
environmental performance, access by disadvantaged groups 
to redress environmental harm or eliminate potential risks, a 
better understanding by all parties of the costs and benefits of 
specific actions, improved decision making, increased political 
awareness and active participation, and improved cross-sectoral 
collaboration. Sometimes institutions accustomed to wielding 
excessive power resist increased stakeholder participation, 
necessitating the balancing role of civil society. In the region, 
the monitoring functions of governments can be usefully 
supplemented by civil society, especially in situations where 
government capacity is constrained.

environmental law and regulation. Imperfect markets, collective

Benefits and limitations
The main considerations of benefits and limitations included in 
the policy analysis are as follows:
•	 economic	and	financial;	
•	 social;	
•	 environmental;	
•	 political	and	institutional;	and
•	 distributional.

In general, the priority policies identified here involve up-front 
costs, which have been a significant barrier in the developing 
countries of Asia and the Pacific, where investment priorities 
have been preferentially directed towards economic growth and 
poverty reduction rather than environmental goals. The so-called 
low-hanging fruit, such as energy efficiency measures that can be 
undertaken relatively easily, are still ripe for harvesting in many 
countries, but may not achieve the scale of structural change 
needed to contribute to global goals. For example, the transition 
to a low-carbon society, which has multiple co-benefits, requires 
massive investment in new, renewable energy systems which 
are often not the cheapest option under current conditions (ADB 
2009b). In addition, the barriers to adopting energy-efficient 
technologies can be multi-faceted. The challenge is to change 
those circumstances, such as through the elimination of fossil fuel 
subsidies and the accelerated depreciation of existing fossil fuel 
installations, to create a situation in which renewable energy will 
be able to compete on equal terms with coal and oil. Continued 
technological development and cooperation on technology 
transfer to reduce the costs of this transition are also essential.

The social implications of the priority policies have tended to 
receive less attention than the economic issues, but a common 
theme is that improved access to information, stakeholder 
empowerment, gender equality, access to environmental justice, 
and equity and benefit sharing will all assist in the transition 
to sustainable development. Safety nets and compensation for 
poor households – for example when disadvantaged by removal 
of subsidies – are also part of the mix. The main barriers are 
unequal powers and the advantages of elites, conflicting social 
and private values and the attraction and psychological power 
of conspicuous consumption. Problems of compliance and 
enforcement are common from the household to the industry 
level, while higher household costs and employment impacts on 
declining industries during policy-initiated transitions can hinder 
progress. The need to relocate vulnerable communities from 
areas of risk can also present a challenge. 

The political and institutional consequences of the suggested 
priority policies are critical, as it is unlikely that business-as-
usual regimes will enable such a policy mix to be effectively 
implemented. Political benefits are observed from promoting 
elements of the green economy that promise economic growth, 
new employment opportunities and environmental benefits. 
These benefits are best illustrated in the economic stimulus 
responses to the global financial crisis, where countries such 
as the Republic of Korea and China have led the world in green 
stimulus packages. The political downside, however, is reflected

investment in renewable energy systems. © Chinaface/iStock

action issues and equity concerns characterize many of the 
environmental issues in the Asia and Pacific region. A final 
policy cluster, therefore, focuses on access to the environmental 
judiciary, with policies covering the integrated chain of 
command-and-control measures, standard setting, monitoring 
and reporting, investigations and inspection of environmental 
crimes, establishment of environmental police and “green” 
courts, and trained environmental judges and prosecutors. 
Examples include the Environmental Court Act of Bangladesh, 
the environmental police force in Viet Nam, the green bench 
of the Supreme and High Courts and the recently established 
Green Tribunal in India as well as regulatory initiatives to combat 
corruption in Indonesia and Singapore.

The benefits are to halt or delay potentially environmentally 
damaging or risky activities, to reach settlements where damage 
has been caused, to save on future remediation costs if risks are 
reduced and ultimately to increase social capital. Specialized 
courts are important as they reduce the burden on enforcement 
agencies, enable conflict resolution and hold government 
agencies responsible for implementation. Establishment of green 
courts could derive from popular environmental movements 
and international treaties. The limitations are that decisions 
reached through these procedures are not always enforced, and 
potential jurisdictional conflicts may emerge between newly 
formed enforcement agencies and existing sectoral agencies. 
Court procedures may also be lengthy and costly, thus effectively 
excluding disadvantaged groups and poor individuals.

Part 2: Policy Options

in fears that being a first mover, such as in implementing a 
carbon tax approach to combat climate change, will lead to unfair 
advantages for those who lag behind. International coordination, 
political vision and courage, supported by a willing electorate, 
are needed to overcome such fears and become a green pioneer. 

Institutional changes are commonly observed to be incremental 
tinkering at the margins rather than wholehearted reform. For 
example, many countries in Asia and the Pacific have added 
climate change responsibilities to an existing environmental 
agency rather than seeking widespread institutional reform that 
would mainstream climate change across all existing agencies 
(IGES 2008). Sub-regional agencies such as the ASEAN Centre for 
Biodiversity and the ASEAN Centre of Energy have been created, 
but without secured funding to support implementation of their 
mandates. Overall, it appears that institutional change in Asia 
and the Pacific has been ad hoc rather than systematic. 

The distributional impacts of priority policies that determine 
who wins and who loses have been barely investigated in 
Asia and the Pacific. In the energy sector, fossil fuel industries 
stand to lose market share, although leading companies may 
ultimately make the transition to alternative energy. In relation 
to biodiversity, new funding arrangements such as payment for 
ecosystem services including REDD+ suggest that traditional 
forest-dependent communities should benefit, but there is 
potential for powerful groups to manipulate such schemes and 
for traditional users to become losers (Bosetti and Lubowski 
2010). In the freshwater sector, agriculture tends to lose out to 
urban and industrial water users, as they are prepared to pay 
higher prices (Dinar 2000). In waste recycling, traditional waste 
collectors and the informal sector are beginning to lose out to 
more formalized waste management, as the value of material 
resources embedded in waste rises in response to shortages of 
raw materials (Medina 2007). 

Transfer and replication of successful policies
As most successful policies have had demonstrable success in 
a limited range of countries, some only in developed countries, 
others in large economies, the objective of this section is to 
analyse whether the suggested priority policies are readily 
transferable and replicable across national boundaries. If they 
cannot easily be transferred because they depend on local 
circumstances that are not widely prevalent, they are unlikely 
to accelerate the achievement of the selected global goals. The 
factors considered include:
•	 how	many	countries	have	already	implemented	such	policies;
•	 how	quickly	the	policies	have	been	adopted	by	multiple	

countries since their first introduction;

•	 how	easily	the	private	sector	has	been	convinced	that	the	

policies are not harmful to their businesses; and 

•	 how	the	policies	have	contributed	co-benefits	that	made	

them even more acceptable.

Internal replication – vertical and horizontal integration
Policy responses in the Asia and Pacific region increasingly 
need to adopt a cross-sectoral approach. Even though the

on the imperative to support and promote the rights of indigenous 
peoples and local communities. © Lee Thomas/iStock

identification of the recommended priority policies in one 
sector helps focus attention, policy interventions are needed 
for simultaneously addressing several of the environmental 
challenges listed, and packages of complementary policies 
should combine to achieve desirable environmental outcomes 
across sectors. For instance, environmental governance for 
climate change should not be seen as separate from that for 
water, and environmental policies for water cannot be separated 
from agriculture and food security because there are interactions 
between those concerns as well as with climate change. Policies 
that build a community’s capacity to adapt to or deal with 
water insecurity in general will facilitate their adaptation to the 
effects of climate change. For example, construction of small 
reservoirs in upper watershed areas can provide both increased 
water security for downstream villages and drought and flood 
control to combat climate change. Climate change never has 
effects in isolation from those of other drivers or pressures of 
environmental change, but tends to aggravate the effects of 
existing ones. What seems like a priority policy intervention 
today might, over the long run, turn out to be maladapted from 
a climate change point of view, thus necessitating constant 
learning from experience and flexible, adaptive management.

External replication – policy transfers across regions
Many of the policies being adopted in the Asia and Pacific region 
had their origin and initial trials in other regions, often Europe 
and the United States (Table 10.2). The failure to implement 
many policies in this region successfully may stem from over-
optimism that if a policy already works in a developed country 
then it should also work in a developing one. For example, the 
strong command-and-control policy regime to manage air and 
water pollution in the United States, involving standard setting, 
permits and prosecution of offenders, tends not to work as 
well in the developing countries of Asia and the Pacific (AECEN 
2004). A policy regime built around voluntary compliance, 
the social pressures of naming and shaming polluters, and 
compensation of victims may be more applicable for the 
socio-cultural context of the region, although measures of 
effectiveness require further analysis.

Creating an enabling environment for effective policies
Part of the above analysis relates to the enabling and/or impeding 
factors that have led to the success or otherwise of specific 
policies. This section starts from the premise that policies are only 
as good as their implementation. Theoretically brilliant policies 
that are complex or difficult to implement are unlikely to be easily 
transferable or replicable across national boundaries. 

Moving from successful policies to policies plus enabling 
conditions 
Identifying policies that work, and those that do not, is of little 
relevance unless the underpinning causal conditions and context 
are understood. A growing body of policy studies identifies 
the factors that allow policy change to happen (Huitema and 
Meijerink 2009). There are many critiques of why policy change 
in the irrigation sector in South Asia, for instance, has been slow 
and tardy (Mollinga et al. 2003). Accordingly, it is useful to look 
at what policies have failed to accomplish and what they have 
achieved (Urs and Whittell 2009).

Filling the policy vacuum: the changing role of markets and 
civil society 
Finally, it is important to look at the changing configuration of 
actors like the state, markets and civil society. Increasingly, there 
is a policy vacuum left by the state that the market and/or civil 
society may intervene to fill. For instance, a common response 
to the inadequate supply of water in many cities in Asia and the 
Pacific is the rising popularity of water markets – the sale of safe 
water by private entrepreneurs – seen in cities like Chennai and 
Kathmandu, amongst others. Privatization of water markets can 
increase efficiency, but laws should be put in place to anticipate 
and limit monopolies.

Given the challenges of balancing growth, poverty alleviation, 
environmental protection and resource conservation, governance 
improvements should prioritize addressing environmental 
concerns at the macro-economic level, specifically focusing on 

patterns of growth and restructuring the economy (ESCAP/ADB/
UNEP 2012; UNEP 2011). Environment remains the foundation 
of sustainable development and if it is weak or compromised, 
then the social and economic pillars of sustainable development 
will also be undermined. By allowing co-benefits, ancillary costs 
and environmental externalities to be integrated into social and 
economic decision making, environmental concerns and climate 
change can be mainstreamed into a sustainable development 
framework. Carefully monitoring the actual outcomes of policy 
decisions and making continuous adjustments, with the full input 
of all stakeholders, are key elements of an adaptive management 
approach. The recent efforts to promote the green economy and 
green growth in the region suggest that the time is ripe to begin 
this transformation.

CONCLUSIONS
The implications of failing to implement the recommended 
policies or clusters of policies make a strong case for their 
adoption, as improved environmental governance is necessary 
to reverse environmental degradation and the unsustainable 
use of natural resources. This chapter not only identifies some 
recommended policies but also the changes to governance 
arrangements necessary for them to be transferred across 
sectoral and/or national boundaries and replicated quickly. 
There is adequate experience with several of the priority policies 
analysed above to justify faster replication, but the differing 
governance contexts and enabling environments in a region 
as diverse as Asia and the Pacific may be barriers to adoption. 
Each of the suggested priority policies or policy clusters has 
experienced some limitations during implementation, so these 
challenges also need to be better understood, and additional 
basic research needs to be undertaken before specific 
recommendations can be made on the transfer of policies to 
new jurisdictions. Nevertheless, there is considerable scope for 
faster uptake of best-practice policies and it is hoped that this 
chapter will have drawn the attention of the region’s decision 
makers to that potential.

Main Messages 

Europe has strong environmental governance 
structures and mechanisms in place. In particular, 
the European Union (EU) has been implementing 
robust environmental policies over the last four 
decades. Regular monitoring, reporting and 
assessment required by legislation is an integral 
part of EU environmental governance, helping to 
inform policy makers whether policies are effective, 
and to identify emerging issues. This concept 
has already or is being emulated in neighbouring 
countries and, although to a lesser extent, through 
the pan-European Environment for Europe ministerial 
process that was initiated in 1991. Moreover, since 
the 2002 Earth Summit in Johannesburg, the EU’s 
agenda has been increasingly oriented to external 
multilateral policies. 

Both EU and non-EU European countries are also 
well on track to meet their own Kyoto targets. 
European countries are implementing climate-
related policies ranging from carbon taxes to 
emissions trading schemes, stimulating renewable 
energy systems and local voluntary efforts by 
municipalities. More recently, climate change 
adaptation strategies are being developed. Large-
scale reductions in anthropogenic greenhouse gas 
emissions can only be achieved through a tightly 
coordinated combination of different policies 
targeting different economic sectors and sources of 
emissions. The EU, with some of its neighbouring 
countries, is also a major donor to various global 
efforts to combat climate change.

Across most of Europe, many aspects of air quality 
have improved in recent decades, although problems 
still remain, particularly related to urban air quality, 
human health and ecosystem degradation. The 
pan-European scientific monitoring network of 
the Convention on Long Range Transboundary Air 
Pollution has been pivotal in building credibility, 
shaping policies and monitoring air quality trends. A 
variety of policies, often mutually enforcing, are being 
applied at regional, national and local scales. Tools 
cover both obligatory and voluntary implementation 
mechanisms, and many are being replicated 
elsewhere in the world, or have the potential to be. 

Freshwater policies have been implemented 
successfully through a mix of policy instruments, 
often directed through strong umbrella legislation, 
but challenges such as overuse of water and 
water pollution persist in parts of Europe. The 
transboundary nature of most European rivers calls 
for close international cooperation, and integrated 
water resources management is increasingly the 
guiding mechanism for implementation. River basin 
management plans have shown potential for transfer 
and use throughout the region, water pollution from 
non-point sources has been effectively reduced 
through broad clusters of policies that complement 
each other, and water metering and water pricing 
have stimulated more responsible use of water. 

Prevention, reuse and recycling of municipal 
wastes are among the most regulated activities in

the region. Comprehensive legislation supported 
by monitoring networks is helping to ensure 
compliance with regulations, but waste volumes 
continue to grow. In Eastern Europe, a legacy of 
industrial wastes from the socialist period still 
poses ecological problems. Policy focus is shifting 
towards producers’ responsibility by encouraging 
innovative approaches such as ecodesign, new 
business models and changing life styles. The EU 
legislation on Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation 
and Restriction of Chemical substances (REACH), 
which replaces a patchwork of previous directives 
and regulations, looks promising for the regulation of 
chemicals in coming years.

The European region is at the forefront of 
multinational biodiversity conservation efforts. 
Networks of protected areas have been successfully 
established through Natura 2000 and comparable 
efforts outside the EU, also stimulating an improved 
knowledge base for preserving and monitoring 
biodiversity. However, due to landscape, ecosystem 
and habitat degradation both within and outside 
protected areas, the overall conservation status 
of habitats and species is showing no sign of 
improvement. Through national initiatives for 
sustainable forest management and payments 
for ecosystem services, the challenges of 
biodiversity conservation, climate change and 
protection of freshwater resources are being 
addressed in an integrated way, and are already 
showing positive results.

INTRODUCTION
The pan-European region is very diverse, with its 37 different 
national languages spoken in the 50 European countries 
(Table 11.1) (Nations Online 2011) and its range of socio-
economic and political systems, as well as in its varied physical 
environment and means of environmental governance. Europe’s 
land area of 23 million km2 (GEO Data Portal 2011; FAO 2010) 
is characterized by a great variety of (agri)cultural landscapes, 
urban agglomerations, extensive coastal zones, forests and 
undisturbed pristine areas. Of the nearly 833 million Europeans, 
about half live in Western Europe, while some 72 per cent of 
the entire region’s population resides in urban areas (GEO Data 
Portal 2011; UNDESA 2010).

Conversion to and intensification of agriculture along with increasing 
demand for greater mobility and urban space have transformed a 
majority of European landscapes over the past 100 years, causing 
fragmentation and loss of natural and semi-natural habitats with 
an associated decline in biodiversity (Chapters 1, 3, 5 and 7) 
(EEA 2010h; COE 2000). However, exposure of Europe’s 
population to multiple air, water and chemical pollutants has 
generally declined, and both the European Union (EU) and most 

non-EU European countries are on track to meet their Kyoto 
targets (Chapters 1, 2, 4, 6 and 7) (EEA 2010h). 

Indeed, considerable progress has been made in meeting 
environmental targets, with the situation improving in many 
areas. Nonetheless, concerns about long-term threats to the 
environment and human health persist, the latter especially 
for Europe’s large urban population (EEA 2010h). Despite 
some successes in decoupling environmental pressures 
from economic growth, Europe’s environmental footprint 
remains disproportionately high. This is due to the continued 
unsustainable use of natural resources both within and outside 
the region to satisfy the high production and consumption level 
of its inhabitants (Chapters 1–7) (EEA 2010h). 

These trends are increasingly linked and complex, and require 
an integrated policy approach for which strong governance 
mechanisms need to be in place. Given that Central and 
Western Europe in particular have a dense network of political 
boundaries, a regional focus to tackle environmental issues 
is necessary. A major attribute of the pan-European region is 
its economic and political interconnectedness, combined with

Part 2: Policy Options

well-established and strong formal governance mechanisms and 
structures to address environmental issues at (sub-)regional 
level. This has made Europe a leader in transboundary as well 
as global environmental decision-making. In particular, the 
EU has more than four decades of experience in developing 
environmental policies: the first Environmental Action Programme 
(EAP) was adopted in 1972 while the sixth ends in mid-2012. EU 
legislation is implemented at a national level within EU Member 
States, with forceful implementation control by EU institutions. 
The legislation is also used in non-member European states on a 
case-by-case and voluntary basis. 

Policy approaches have evolved over time, using policies and 
single-issue instruments in the 1970s and 1980s, followed by 
policy integration and raising public awareness in the 1980s and 
1990s and thereafter (EEA 2010h; Hey 2004). An integral part of 
EU environmental governance is the regular monitoring, reporting 
and assessment required by EU legislation; these activities 
help to inform policy makers about effectiveness and also help 
to identify emerging issues. Since the early 2000s, European 
environmental policy has increasingly been guided by the fact 
that well-designed, coherent policies that integrate different 
sectoral policy domains can provide greater benefits at lower 
costs than several single policies. As a result, Europe’s natural 
resources are used with increasing efficiency (EEA 2010h).

This concept is already being emulated in EU neighbouring 
countries and in the pan-European Environment for Europe 
ministerial process that was initiated in 1991. In September 
2011, for example, the Seventh pan-European Environment 
for Europe Ministerial Conference focused on the sustainable 
management of water and water-related ecosystems and on 
greening the economy including mainstreaming the environment 
into economic development. 
 
The countries of Eastern Europe also have well-developed 
formal environmental policies and regulations, although the 
implementation and enforcement of these has often tended 
to lag. In the early 1990s, following the collapse of industry in 
Eastern Europe, environmental pressures dropped substantially 
in many countries, giving the public and authorities a false 
sense of security. The focus of attention shifted towards 
more urgent needs related to economic restructuring and 
development, with an inclination to make the economic 
transition easier by reducing environmental regulation. At first 
this strategy worked, but later, when countries regained their 
economic strength, it began to backfire. 

A new wave of improved environmental legislation and policies 
can now be expected in the non-EU part of Europe, the current 
global financial crisis notwithstanding. Promising policies 
include, for example, integrated river basin management and 
cross-boundary biodiversity conservation. Another example 
is the Inter-Parliamentary Assembly of the Commonwealth 
of Independent States (IPA CIS), with its consultative and 
informative role. It has a Permanent Commission on Agricultural 
Policy, Natural Resources and Ecology, which advises the

protection, agriculture, energy production and recreational activities are

parliaments of CIS countries and suggests sample legislation 
on environmental issues. Practically all aspects of modern 
environmental policy are covered, ranging from environmental 
security, environmental insurance and strategic environmental 
assessments to environmental monitoring, energy conservation 
and environmental education (IPA CIS 2011). 

POLICY APPRAISAL
For this chapter, five key challenges/priority issues were 
identified for Europe, in no particular order, during a GEO 
regional consultation held in September 2010: 
•	 climate	change;
•	 air	quality;
•	 freshwater;
•	 chemicals	and	waste;	and	
•	 biodiversity.	

At the GEO Regional Consultation, five international 
environmental goals related to the key challenges were 
identified, and regional-level goals were added later where 
applicable. The group then selected promising policies that 
have already shown some degree of success in helping to speed 
up meeting the globally and regionally agreed environmental 
goals (Table 11.2).

The Introduction to GEO-5 explains the methodology applied in 
this appraisal in more detail. It is acknowledged that: 
•	 recent,	innovative	policies	do	not	have	a	long	enough	

track record to be selected for this appraisal, though some 
promising emerging policies are included in the conclusions 
at the end of this chapter; 

•	 even	where	actual	evidence	of	policy	effectiveness	does	exist,	
such environmental improvements cannot usually be directly 
linked to one single policy or cluster of policies because of 
impacts from other sectoral policies, economic developments 
or political restructuring; and 

•	 there	are	certainly	other	priority	issues	in	parts	of	the	region	

– such as the marine and coastal areas surrounding large 
parts of Europe, a new energy mix, land-use change and 
land degradation, or developments in Europe’s mountainous 
areas – but these were not among the maximum of five key 
challenges/priority issues selected for this analysis by the 
GEO regional consultation.

Climate change
In terms of the total reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, 
European countries are leading the global climate change 
mitigation effort by a wide margin. Other large advanced 
economies have either not ratified the Kyoto Protocol (United 
States), are failing to meet their Kyoto targets (Canada) or are 
allowed to increase their emissions (Australia). Japan, with its 
6 per cent reduction target, is the main exception. Figure 11.1 
presents current emission data and trends for the main sectors 
in the EU-27, clearly illustrating the dominant role of energy 
(Chapters 1, 2 and 3).

Figure 11.1 Sectoral trends and projections for 
EU-27 greenhouse gas emissions, 1990–2020

The EU-15 is well on track to meet its Kyoto target; indeed, over-
compliance may even be achieved when the Clean Development 
Mechanism, Joint Implementation mechanism, and carbon 
removals such as forestry activities, are factored in (EEA 2010j). 
None of the Central and Eastern European countries have faced 
any problems in meeting their Kyoto Protocol obligations as their 
targets were set before the fall in emissions associated with the 
collapse of the Soviet bloc. In addition, regional emission targets 
for the post-2012 period have been set (Box 11.1). 

Box 11.1 Greenhouse gas reduction pledges for  
the post-2012 period 

In March 2007, the EU-27 unilaterally committed itself  
to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by at least  
20 per cent by 2020 compared to 1990, and to increase 
this commitment to 30 per cent if other industrialized 
countries commit to comparable emission reductions and 
developing countries contribute adequately according to 
their capabilities. These commitments were renewed by the 
EU-27 in the Copenhagen Accord in 2009. Similar pledges 
have been made by other advanced European economies, 
notably Iceland, Monaco, Norway and Switzerland. The EU 
has further declared that it will seek to achieve reductions 
of the order of 80–95 per cent by 2050 (EEA 2010j). In the 
Copenhagen Accord, the Russian Federation pledged to 
reduce its emissions by 15–25 per cent by 2020 and 50 per 
cent by 2050 compared to 1990, and Ukraine by 20 and  
50 per cent respectively. Belarus, Croatia, the Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Moldova and Montenegro 
have also formally pledged to reduce their emissions. The 
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 
(UNFCCC) Conference of the Parties in Cancún in December 
2010 formally put those pledges into UN documentation, 
and the UNFCCC Secretariat will monitor progress (CG 2011).

sectors and sources of emissions. Only then can efficient 
synergies be achieved. 

In 2009, the EU formally adopted its climate and energy package, 
an integrated approach with binding legislation to implement the 
EU’s three main climate and energy targets: 
•	 reduce	EU	greenhouse	gas	emissions	to	20	per	cent	below	

1990 levels by 2020; 

•	 reduce	EU	energy	consumption	by	20	per	cent	compared	with	
projected levels by 2020 through increased energy efficiency; 
and 

•	 meet	20	per	cent	of	EU	energy	needs	from	renewable	sources,	

including biofuels, by 2020 (EC 2009a). 

These commitments together have been labelled the 20-20-20 
targets, which are being implemented through an array of 
policies ranging from carbon taxes and emissions trading 
schemes to local voluntary efforts by municipalities (EC 2009b). 
Two of the most promising policies are discussed below. 

European Emissions Trading System 
The EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) was launched in 
2005 as a cornerstone of EU climate policy and the key tool for 
reducing industrial greenhouse gas emissions in a cost-effective 
manner. It is the first and largest international scheme for trading 
emission allowances, and is open to non-EU countries on the 
condition that they meet the strict standards of the EU ETS.

ambitious climate and energy package. © George Clerk/iStock

Large-scale reductions of greenhouse gas emissions can only be 
achieved, however, through a tightly coordinated and coherent 
combination of different policies targeting different economic 

The EU ETS covers about 40 per cent of EU greenhouse gas 
emissions. For 2009, the EU carbon trading market was estimated 
to be worth nearly US$118.5 billion per year, compared to a

global carbon credit market worth an estimated US$143.75 
billion. In 2009, the volume of emissions covered by the system 
reached 6.33 billion tonnes compared to 41 million tonnes 
covered by the Chicago Climate Exchange (CCX) (Kossoy and 
Ambrosi 2010).
 
Falling prices of carbon credits in the first (2005–2007) and 
second (2008–2013) phases of the EU ETS, although caused by 
different factors, demonstrate the crucial requirements of the 
supply of accurate, reliable and constantly updated figures on 
energy consumption and emissions, verified by strict monitoring 
(Morris and Worthington 2010; Ellerman 2008). The Third Trading 
Period (from 1 January 2013) will implement several important 
changes such as inclusion of airline emissions, increased 
auctioning of allowances, and an ambitious EU-wide cap instead 
of national caps. The EU ETS cap will decrease continuously from 
2013 onwards using a linear reduction factor (Figure 11.2). 

The EU ETS is an attractive option for European countries outside 
the EU. Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway are already covered 
by it through their membership of the European Economic Area 
Agreement, while Switzerland will be the first non-EU country 
whose national emissions trading system is linked to the EU 
ETS (Bart 2007; Ellerman and Buchner 2007) and Australia is 
exploring this possibility as well (Planet Arc 2011). 

Feed-in tariffs for renewable energy systems 
Feed-in tariff schemes were elaborated as the main support 
mechanism for renewable energy systems. Its goal goes far 
beyond reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions only; it also 
takes issues such as energy security, independence from 

conventional fuel price volatility or decentralization of energy 
into account (Blanco and Rodrigues 2008).

The policy offers long-term contracts to renewable energy 
producers, typically based on the cost of generation of each 
technology with two basic pricing models: a market-independent 
fixed price, applied by Germany’s Renewable Energy Source Act 
(EEG 2009), and a market-dependent premium price model, 
used, for example, by Spain (Mendonça et al. 2009; Klessmann 
et al. 2008). The German Renewable Energy Feed-in-Tariff (REFIT) 
scheme, launched as early as 1991, is a successful example 
(Box 11.3). Spain is another positive example, as the country 
has established a dynamic, export-oriented and job-creating 
renewable energy sector even if it has not succeeded in other 
areas of climate policy (Sills and Roca 2010; Bechberger 2009; 
del Rio Gonzalez 2008). About two-thirds of EU Member States 
have now built up renewable energy capacity using feed-in tariffs 
(Figure 11.3) (Weidner and Mez 2008; Busch 2003).

At least 17 developing countries and emerging economies, 
including Brazil, China, India, Kenya, Nicaragua, South Africa 
and the Republic of Tanzania, have feed-in tariff schemes in 
place, most of which have been implemented within the last 
five years through, among others, the Global Energy Transfer 
Feed-in Tariff for Developing Countries (GET FIT) programme 
(Box 11.2) (REN21 2010). About 60 per cent of projects 
that have been registered under the Clean Development 
Mechanism or are in the pipeline for 2012 are for renewable 
energy, showing that development of this has become the 
most attractive climate policy option for developing countries 
(UNFCCC 2011; UNEP Risoe Centre 2010).

Box 11.2 The German Renewable Energy Feed-in 
Tariff scheme

Between 2000 and 2010 under the REFIT scheme, the 
share of electricity in Germany produced from renewable 
sources increased from 6.3 to about 17 per cent. In 
2010, investments in Germany’s renewable energy sector 
amounted to about US$3.5 billion and employed around 
370 000 people (Jänicke 2011). The equivalent of 5.8 per 
cent of Germany’s CO2 emissions in 2009 was thus avoided 
(AGEE-Stat 2010). The Deutsche Bank Climate Change 
Advisors established the Global Energy Transfer Feed-in 
Tariff for Developing Countries (GET FIT) programme, which 
envisages a REFIT premium for individual producers to 
be paid by both the national government and the GET FIT 
fund. The concept of a global fund similar to the GET FIT 
has already found its way into the footnotes of the climate 
negotiations in the context of the Nationally Appropriate 
Mitigation Action (NAMA) programme (UNFCCC 2009).

Climate adaptation policies 
When floods caused serious human and material damage in 
Central Europe in the summer of 2002, the European Commission 
(EC) reacted immediately by proposing the use of existing funds 
in a flexible way to respond to the urgent needs of the people 
affected. By mid-November 2002, an EU Solidarity Fund (EUSF) 
had been launched to finance short-term responses such as 
reconstruction of damaged or destroyed infrastructure, and 

Box 11.3 Transferring innovative climate insurance 
schemes 

Many European insurance companies such as Swiss Re, 
AXA, Allianz, Munich Re, MicroInsure and Zurich have 
helped pioneer index-based weather risk transfer 
instruments in low-income countries. For example, Swiss Re 
started its index-based weather insurance scheme in India 
in collaboration with a micro-finance institution and 
a local insurer in 2004, since when a total of 350 000 
policies have been sold to smallholder farmers in India. 
Similar solutions have been successfully deployed 
elsewhere: in 2007, Swiss Re designed and implemented 
index-based weather risk transfer instruments for three 
village clusters in Sauri (Kenya), Tiby (Mali) and Koraro 
(Ethiopia), protecting 150 000 farmers against drought risk. 
The innovation is that insurance pay-outs are based on the 
performance of the weather index rather than on actual 
damage incurred or losses suffered. One of the advantages 
is that  pay-outs can be calculated and disbursed quickly 
and automatically without the need for households to file 
a claim formally (Warner and Spiegel 2009).

to secure protective infrastructure such as dams and dykes. 
As the EUSF is restricted to the uninsured sectors of public 
infrastructure, it should be supplemented with a unified, 
innovative insurance system, being developed across Europe, 
which has the power to transfer risks from the local level to 
national and even global insurance markets through primary 
insurance and re-insurance (Box 11.3) (EC 2004). 

Another tool to assist in preparing for the impacts of climate 
change is the 2007 EU Floods Directive, under which draft 
national flood risk maps had to be submitted in 2011, with 
final versions to be ready by 2013 and final adaptation plans 
by 2015 (ECouncil 2007). More recently, the EU White Paper on 
Adaptation to Climate Change (EC 2009b) has moved beyond 
short-term disaster responses, outlining key steps towards 
a European framework for long-term adaptation measures 
and policies to increase resilience, to be implemented at 
national and local levels. Top-down strategies are envisaged 
for mainstreaming adaptation into sectoral policies, focusing 
on sectors such as land-use planning, agriculture, water 
management and biodiversity/nature conservation. Bottom-up 
activities focus on building adaptive capacity and implementing 
action at municipal level (EEA 2010h). In addition, a new EU 
Clearinghouse on climate change impacts, vulnerability and 
adaptation was put in place with the first stage of the strategy to 
run until 2012 (EC 2010c).

Air quality 
Although many aspects of air quality across Europe have 
improved in recent decades due to emission reductions from 
industry and transport (Chapter 2), air pollution continues 
to pose a threat to human health, especially in urban areas 
(EEA 2010h). For example, exposure to fine particulate matter 
(PM2.5) was estimated to have caused 5 million lost life years in 
2005 in the EEA-32 (EEA 2010h). Similarly, other air pollutants 
continue to cause environmental damage to ecosystems, with 
10 per cent of the EEA-32 natural ecosystem area still subject 
to acidifying pollutant deposition caused by sulphur dioxide 
(SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) (EEA 2010h), and more than 
40 per cent of sensitive terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems 
still subject to eutrophying atmospheric nitrogen deposition in 
the form of nitrogen oxides and ammonia (NH3) (EEA 2010h). 
Despite declining peak ground-level ozone (O3) concentrations, 
background levels are steadily rising, also leading to ecosystem 
damage (UNECE 2010). 

The Convention on Long Range Transboundary Air Pollution 
(CLRTAP) of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe 
(UNECE) has been pivotal in providing the scientific evidence 
that has underpinned efforts to shape air quality policy. 
CLRTAP’s flagship 1999 Gothenburg Protocol (UNECE 1999) 
promotes an integrated multi-pollutant, multi-effect approach 
to optimize efforts to improve air quality across Europe. It is 
comparable to the 2001 EU National Emission Ceilings Directive, 
which establishes legally binding pollutant-specific emission 
ceilings for nitrogen oxides, non-methane volatile organic 
compounds, sulphur dioxide and ammonia for the EU-27. The 

298

Part 2: Policy Options

2008 Clean Air for Europe (CAFE) Directive merges much of the 
existing air quality legislation to develop long-term, strategic 
and integrated policy advice.

Such European approaches have been instrumental in 
providing the impetus for the development of a suite of air 
quality policies through the establishment of binding emission 
and air quality standards. Three outstanding environmental 
success stories are described here: vehicle emissions and fuel 
standards, the EU Industrial Emissions Directive and local air 
quality management policies.

European vehicle emission and fuel standards
Historically, road transport has contributed substantially to 
atmospheric pollution by producing emissions of lead (Pb), 
nitrogen oxides and particulate matter (Chapter 2). Reduction of 
these emissions has been achieved through the establishment 
of EU directives controlling both fuel and vehicle emissions, 
with fuel policy focused on banning lead and limiting sulphur 
content (ECouncil 1999, 1998). European Vehicle Emission 
Standards (Euro standards) control exhaust emissions of 
nitrogen oxides, non-methane volatile organic compounds and 
total hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and particulate matter 
from new vehicles sold within the EU. Since the establishment 
of the Euro 1 standards in 1992, more stringent ones have been 
introduced, tightening controls on different pollutants, vehicle 
categories, weights and classes, engine volumes and fuel types; 
Euro 5 standards have been in force since 2007. Figure 11.4 
shows the vehicle stock allocated to the Euro standards that 
have been established to date. Figure 11.5 shows the timeline 
for the introduction of increasingly stringent Euro standards 
in the EU and their transferability through the subsequent

Despite a 26 per cent increase in fuel consumption across the 
entire transport sector between 1990 and 2005, actual pollutant 
emissions in 2005 were significantly lower than a theoretical 
no-new-policy scenario assuming conventional technologies 
and no introduction of Euro standards: in the EEA-32, nitrogen 
oxide was 40 per cent lower than the scenario figures; carbon 
monoxide 80 per cent, non-methane volatile organic compounds 
68 per cent and particulate matter 60 per cent lower (EEA 
2010d). Lead emissions from road transport alone decreased 
by 99 per cent (EEA 2010c) and sulphur dioxide emissions by 
92 per cent between 1990 and 2008 (EEA 2010e). Additional 
benefits of the Euro standards include increased engine lifetime 
and lower maintenance costs due to the removal of sulphur 
(PCFV 2007), better fuel economy and reduced greenhouse gas 
emissions (ICCT 2007).

The implementation of cleaner fuel policies involves costs related 
to fuel switching, such as replacing lead with other fuel additives 
and shifting to producers of low-sulphur crude oil, improving 
engine technologies and upgrading refineries (PCFV 2007). 
However, the benefits of lead phase-out and desulphurization 
in terms of human and ecosystem health in general exceed the 
costs (Blumberg et al. 2004; Lovei 1998). The EU, Japan and the 
United States lead the world in desulphurization policies (PCFV 
2011a) and by 2011, vehicle fuel in the European region was 
lead free (PCFV 2011c).

The time lag in the effectiveness of vehicle emission policy 
depends on the average age of the vehicle fleet and the 
affordability of new vehicles. Awareness raising, product 
labelling, enforcement and regular control of fuel quality, now 
considered essential for vehicle policies to reach their full 
potential, have ensured successful implementation of these 
policies (PCFV 2007).

EU Industrial Emissions Directive
The 2010 EU Industrial Emissions Directive is designed to 
consolidate seven existing EU directives that have evolved 
since the early 1980s and have been instrumental in reducing 
industrial sulphur dioxide emission. The new directive will 
combine proven policy measures including technical emission 
controls, best available techniques, fuel switching and reduced 
sulphur content in liquid fuels.

Implementation of these measures has resulted in a clear 
reduction in sulphur dioxide emissions across Europe over 
recent decades (Figure 11.6), effectively decoupling them from 
industrial activities, especially in Western Europe (EEA 2010e). 
To some extent these reductions were aided by socio-political 
and economic changes between 1990 and 2000 in former 
socialist Eastern Europe. The reduction of total anthropogenic 
sulphur dioxide emissions in the EU-27 – by 80 per cent between 
1990 and 2009 (EEA 2010e) – has led to substantial declines

in acidification rates as exceedances of critical loads across 
Europe have been reduced. The implementation of the measures 
did, however, involve additional costs, requiring investment 
from the private and public sectors. The new EU Industrial 
Emissions Directive aims to reduce these costs by streamlining 
and enhancing cost efficiency and effectiveness (ECouncil 
2010). Many control technologies have proven transferability, 
having been adopted in many Asian countries where they are of 
particular relevance since 80 per cent of Asia’s energy demand 
is met by coal-fired power. Enhanced penetration of measures 
across Asia could yield further substantial improvements in 
sulphur dioxide emission reductions (Klimont et al. 2009).

Local air quality management policies
Under the 2008 Clean Air for Europe (CAFE) Directive, local 
authorities are obliged to prepare air quality management plans 
to ensure compliance with air quality standards. Many policy 
measures have focused on urban transport since this sector 
generates 70 per cent of air pollutants in urban areas (Chapter 1) 
(EC 2007a). Perhaps the most influential of these policy 
measures have been low-emission zones that limit or ban the 
most polluting vehicles from entering urban areas and encourage 
faster renewal of the vehicle fleet in line with vehicle emission 
standards. Around 100 low-emission zones in ten European 
countries have either been established or are in the process 
of being established (Box 11.4) (LEZ 2011). Other measures 
include congestion charging, expansion and improvement of 
public transport and cycling infrastructure, car pooling and 
cycle sharing systems, renewal or retrofitting of municipal 

vehicle fleets, and traffic and green areas management. Air 
quality management plans also require the public dissemination 
of current information detailing ambient air pollution and 
exceedances of air quality standards (ECouncil 2008a), with 
citizens and legal entities having the right to go to court in cases 
of non-compliance with standards. However, individual lawsuits 
for breaches of air quality standards are rarely pursued due to 
costs, time-consuming procedures and low awareness (ECouncil 
2008a). Besides, many urban areas in Europe are not compliant 
with current European air quality legislation (EEA 2010i). To be 
really successful, local air quality management plans require

Box 11.4 Stockholm’s air quality management policies in a low-emission zone

Stockholm’s low-emission zone was launched in 1996 and 
initially targeted heavy-duty vehicles entering the city centre. 
Vehicles complying with Euro 1 standards were allowed to 
enter freely while those more than eight years old had to 
be retrofitted or issued a permit. Enforcement was carried 
out by police inspections leading to an overall compliance 
rate of around 90 per cent within a few years (Burman and 
Johansson 2001). Actual air pollution concentrations in 
2000 were down by 0.5–2 per cent for nitrogen oxides 
and by 0.5–9 per cent for particulate matter compared to 
the theoretical values calculated for a no-policy situation 
(Burman and Johansson 2001).

Then in 2007, following a successful trial period in 2006, a 
variable congestion tax was launched for vehicles entering 
Stockholm’s city centre on weekdays during working hours. 
Clean vehicles running on electricity and biofuels were exempt 
from the tax. Burman and Johansson (2010) found that: 
•	 the	number	of	trips	and	the	distance	travelled	in	the	inner	

city decreased in 2006 by 100 000 per day and 8.5 per cent 
respectively;

•	 the	share	of	clean	vehicles	in	the	private	fleet	increased 

from 5 per cent in 2006 to 14 per cent in 2008;

•	 average	pollutant	concentrations	decreased	in	the	inner	city	

by 10 per cent for nitrogen oxides, 15 per cent for carbon 
monoxide and 15–20 per cent for particulate matter.

Both air quality management policies were found to be 
even more effective if supported by additional measures 
such as green area networks, clean fuels, clean vehicles, 
extension of public transport and promotion of cycling and 
walking. Nonetheless, the congestion tax has been shown 
to generate a net social benefit of around US$95 million 
(€70 million) per year in the form of shorter and more 
reliable travel times, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, 
health and environmental benefits, greater traffic safety, 
increased public transport and higher government revenue 
(Eliasson 2009). 

adequate monitoring and information systems and appropriate 
institutional mandates for local authorities. 

Freshwater 
In large parts of Europe demand for water often exceeds local 
availability, a trend that is likely to be exacerbated by climate 
change. In addition, both point and diffuse sources of pollution 
are still significant in parts of Europe, as a result of which some 
health risks remain (Chapter 4) (EEA 2010h). Europe’s water 
challenges are driven by competing demands for water by 
agriculture, industry, public water supply and tourism, and further 
complicated by the transboundary nature of many European 
freshwater resources. Addressing these challenges calls for strong 
environmental governance structures, with a focus on coherent and 
integrated efforts and regional cooperation (Chapters 1 and 16).

The EU Water Framework Directive (ECouncil 2000) and  
pan-European UNECE instruments such as the Convention on 
the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses (Water 
Convention) provide the basis for solving major water issues 
in the region. The Water Framework Directive brings the many 
isolated policies that have been developed in the EU since 
the mid-1970s together into one coherent legal framework for 
water policy decision-making within the river basin context. 
Its main goal is to protect and enhance the status of all EU 
waters, including groundwater, rivers, lakes and coastal waters, 
and water-dependent ecosystems, and to ensure long-term 
sustainable use of water resources. The Water Convention offers 
a common platform for both EU and non-EU European countries 
to exchange and transfer knowledge and create common 
understanding, and is a useful tool for assisting in implementing 
EU water legislation by non-EU countries.

Three specific policy instruments with some history of effective 
implementation have been selected for further appraisal: 
integrated management of transboundary river basins; policy 
mixes to address non-point sources of pollution; and water 
metering and volume-based pricing.

Integrated management of transboundary river basins 
Water does not stop at administrative or political boundaries, 
making regional cooperation crucial between countries that 
share the natural geographical and hydrological unit of a 
river basin. The overarching approach of integrated water 
resources management has proven to be an effective policy for 
valuing, managing and protecting water-related ecosystems 
(UNECE 2011a). The development of river basin management 
plans is one of the main tools for implementing the Water 
Framework Directive, which focuses on pollution prevention 
and control, greater public participation in water management, 
and economic analysis of water use. The plans require the 
integration of industrial, agricultural and rural development, 
nature conservation and forestry programmes at the river basin 
scale and, in many cases, transboundary collaboration and 
coordination through river basin commissions. Progress in 
cooperation in the region is varied, however. 

The first river basin commission in Europe – the International 
Commission for the Protection of the Rhine – celebrated its 60th 
anniversary in 2010, and has registered numerous successes 
over the years. Similar commissions have been established 
since for many European rivers, gradually moving eastwards 
despite the fact that in non-EU countries a comprehensive 
and strong legal basis for cooperation is often still lacking 
(UNECE 2011b). As many water bodies are shared by EU and 

302

Part 2: Policy Options

non-EU nations, countries are encouraged to jointly prepare river 
basin management plans: the Tisza River Basin Management 
Plan provides a recent example of such cooperation across EU 
borders (Box 11.5).

By sharing the benefits and responsibility of sustainably co-
managed water resources, economic development is fostered, 
establishing a connection between economic activities and the 
environment. River basin management plans also encourage 
public participation in working and expert groups. However, this 
approach still faces serious limitations due to the magnitude and 
complexity of the problems it seeks to address and the significant 

number of stakeholders who need to be involved (Figure 11. 7) 
(Sendzimir et al. 2008).

A mix of policies to address diffuse sources of water pollution
Eutrophication, predominantly caused by sewage discharges 
and agricultural run-off, is a major threat to European freshwater 
resources. Policies to reduce the flow of nutrients from point 
sources are well known and have proved to be successful, 
provided that sufficient funding is allocated to construct 
and manage water treatment systems. Tackling the problem 
of diffuse sources of freshwater pollution is much more 
challenging (DEFRA 2002).

Box 11.5 Integrated Tisza River Basin Management Plan

The Tisza River, which flows through parts of Hungary, Romania, 
the Republic of Serbia, the Slovak Republic and Ukraine, is the 
largest tributary of the Danube. The main pressures threatening 
the region are pollution from nutrient, organic and hazardous 
substances and both floods and droughts. The countries 
of the Tisza Basin have prepared an integrated river basin 
management plan, formally adopted in April 2011, in which 

the steps and long-term action needed to reach the required 
improved water status for the basin by 2015 are outlined. The 
plan attempts to deal with the complex links between different, 
potentially or actually conflicting, objectives and actors in 
integrated management (Figure 10.7). Experience gained in 
developing the plans can be transferred to other basins shared 
by EU and non-EU countries (UNDP and GEF 2011).

Europe 303

There is significant experience in Europe of applying mixes of 
policies to reduce diffuse nutrient run-off, including accounting 
systems for the use of nitrogen in agriculture (Box 11.6), regulations 
on livestock density and the use of animal manure, purchase 
of nitrogen quotas, taxes on fertilizers, and compensation for 
converting agricultural land into wetlands or forest (OECD 2007a). 
Denmark, for example, has applied a large cluster of such mixed 
policies since the late 1980s, taking their synergistic effects 
into account, while avoiding disproportionate burdens on any 
particular stakeholder (Petersen and Knudsen 2010; Jacobsen 
2004). As a result, the application of nutrients in Denmark has 
steadily decreased since the early 1990s (Figure 11.8).

Box 11.6 Nitrogen accounting in Denmark 

A cornerstone in Danish policies addressing nutrient run-
off is an obligatory, detailed nitrate accounting system 
introduced in 1993. Under this system, a preliminary, yearly 
nitrogen quota is calculated for each farm, depending on 
the area of arable land, the crops planted and the soil type. 
The accounting system is combined with other obligations, 
such as regulations on the use of animal manure and limits 
on livestock density in compliance with the EU Nitrates 
Directive (91/676/EEC). To reduce administrative costs both 
for public authorities and for farmers, the Danish authorities 
developed software in 2005 with pre-filled nitrogen accounts 
on the basis of information collected in previous years, 
and further information on, for example, feed and fertilizer 
wholesalers and slaughterhouses (OECD 2007a). 

Water metering and volume-based pricing
Europe has relatively high water consumption due to high 
agricultural and industrial demand (Chapter 4). In addition, 
considerable losses often occur in the supply chain, aggravating 
shortages in already water-scarce regions. In some countries up 
to 40 per cent of the total amount of water transported may be 
lost before it even reaches the consumer, while in others it can 
be below 10 per cent (EEA 2010h). Metering, cost recovery tariffs 
and proper pricing structures stimulate more responsible water 
use, at the same time generating funds for the maintenance of 
the supply system.

While water metering is a common policy tool in many counties 
of Western Europe, Central and Eastern European countries are 
still in the process of transition from a flat-rate price charged per 
person to a system of volume metering. Various studies reveal 
that on average, if individual metering systems are in place, 
reductions of 10–40 per cent can be achieved in household water 
use (Inman and Jeffrey 2006; Scheuer 2005).

In addition to metering, several Western European countries 
apply cost recovery tariffs and have introduced site-specific 
pricing structures. An increasing block rate creates the strongest 
incentive for conservation, applying a user-pays principle, under 
which the unit rate for water increases with water use, keeping 
the price for basic water needs relatively low (Figure 11.9). This 
system is becoming more common in both households and 
commercial sectors in Western European countries (OECD 2009). 
Applying this experience in Central and Eastern Europe would 
not only reduce inefficient water consumption, but also generate 
funds for modernizing the water sector, increasing the reliability 
of water services delivery (Box 11.7).

This policy, however, faces several limitations. The costs of meter 
installation could be too heavy a burden for poor households 
(Melikyan 2003), conflicting with the Millennium Development 
Goal (MDG) 7c of halving, by 2015, the proportion of the 

Box 11.7 Water metering in Armenia 

By the late 1990s, the water sector in Armenia was severely 
degraded due to poor maintenance and a failure to invest, 
with non-revenue water use amounting to around 70 per cent 
nationwide. Less than 15 per cent of the utility costs were 
recovered, compared to an average of 30–40 per cent among 
newly independent countries (OECD 2007a). In 1999, the 
Armenian government launched the following measures to 
reform the water supply and sanitation sector: 
•	reduce	sector	dependence	on	state	subsidies	and	donor	
assistance; 
•	raise	revenues	from	increased	collection	of	water	payments	
based on metering; and 
•	restructure	water	utility	debts	(OECD	2008).	

Soon after the reforms took place, average water use 
decreased three to four times compared to the use based 
on flat-rate calculations. The massive process of introducing 
individual metering became a trigger for a chain of water 
sector improvements, all backed by a legal, regulatory 
and institutional framework that enabled private sector 
involvement accompanied by investment and management 
efficiencies. As a result, the quality and reliability of water 
delivery improved.

population without sustainable access to safe drinking water 
and basic sanitation (UN 2000). Also, water pricing should not 
result in a situation in which personal hygiene and health are 
compromised in order to pay a water bill (EEA 2009b). To become 
successful, water pricing and meter installation require a good 
understanding of relationships between price and use in each 
sector, taking local conditions into account. Special subsidy 
schemes could be introduced for providing free meter installation 
for poor families, gradual repayment terms, and special provisions 
for writing off vulnerable families’ accumulated water debts.

Chemicals and waste
Both in the EU and in Eastern Europe, issues related to chemicals 
and waste have always been of primary importance. The EU’s 
waste policy consists of three levels of legislation. The first, 
so-called horizontal, level defines overall requirements for 
all waste types and consists of the 2008 Waste Framework 
Directive, which is the cornerstone of current EU waste policy 
(ECouncil 2008b), and the 2006 Waste Shipment Regulation. 
The second level of legislation deals with waste installations 
and includes the Waste Incineration Directive, the 1999 Landfill 
Directive and the 2000 Port Facilities Directive. In addition, the 
2010 Industrial Emissions Directive also defines requirements 
for some waste installations. Finally, the third level deals with 
specific waste streams such as waste containing polychlorinated 
biphenyls and terphenyls (PCBs/PCTs), waste oils, sewage 
sludge, electrical accumulators like batteries, and packaging 
waste. One example of such regulation is the Waste Electrical and 
Electronic Equipment Directive, which deals with the collection 
and recycling of such waste (ECouncil 2002b). It also includes the 
Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive, which bans the 
use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic 
products (ECouncil 2002a).

A basic principle of the EU Waste Framework Directive is the 
hierarchy of waste management originally established in the 
1996 Waste Strategy (Shinn 2005). It states that, in order to better 
protect the environment, Member States should take measures 
for their waste treatment in line with the hierarchy shown in 
Figure 11.10, which is listed in descending order of priority.

One of the EU’s major aims has always been waste reduction, 
but this goal has so far not been achieved (EEA 2010h). On 
the contrary, the amount of waste has been growing; notable 
examples including construction and demolition waste, packaging, 
hazardous and municipal waste, and sewage sludge (EEA 2010h). 
This trend has to be reversed, particularly as resource efficiency 
is one of seven flagship initiatives of the EC’s Europe 2020 
Strategy (EC 2011b, 2011c), which is reflected in the EU goals 
of decoupling resource use from economic growth, measured as 
lower resource use per unit of gross domestic product (GDP), and 
of minimizing waste. In addition to reducing waste generation, it is 
important to improve waste recycling. Current EU data indicate that 
only 38 per cent of total waste is reused or recycled (EEA 2010h). 

Even though radioactive waste is not a subject of the waste 
hierarchy, it has important implications for both safety and 
energy production. On 19 July 2011, the European Council 
adopted the Radioactive Waste and Spent Fuel Management 
Directive, which sets standards for the safe disposal of spent fuel 
and radioactive waste from nuclear power plants as well as from 
medicine or research. This was a major achievement achievement 
for nuclear and environmental safety in the EU.

Other non-EU European countries also face significant challenges 
in waste policy. For example, Belarus, the Russian Federation and 

306

Part 2: Policy Options

Ukraine all have large amounts of industrial waste in landfills 
as well as mining waste, with few or no financial incentives 
to recycle them. This is the result of many Soviet-era waste 
management and reuse practices being abandoned without 
alternative schemes being introduced (Devyatkin 2009). 

Waste prevention 
The EU Waste Prevention Directive of 2008 is based on definitions 
laid down in the Waste Framework Directive, in which prevention 
has been given the highest priority. Article 3.12 of the directive 
demands waste prevention through measures taken before a 
substance, material or product has become waste, by reducing: 
•	 the	quantity	of	waste,	including	through	the	reuse	of	products	

or the extension of the lifespan of products; 

•	 the	adverse	impacts	of	the	generated	waste	on	the	

environment and human health; or 

•	 the	content	of	harmful	substances	in	materials	and	products.	

Waste prevention should also incorporate such aspects 
as ecodesign, life-cycle approaches, changing business 
models and consumption patterns (Box 11.8; Figure 11.11). 

Box 11.8 Extended producer responsibility

The concept of extended producer responsibility in Europe 
widens a manufacturer’s responsibility across a product’s 
life cycle from its sale to its disposal, creating an incentive 
to avoid unnecessary waste and encouraging recycling and 
recovery. One example of this is the Green Dot system, which 
puts a levy on producers for the collection and recycling of 
waste components of their packaging (EC 2010b). If well 
designed, this practice provides significant incentives to 
introduce waste prevention mechanisms and to consider the 
entire life cycle of the product (EC 2010b).

The practical outcomes of this policy can be achieved through 
a number of instruments, including legal provisions, voluntary 
agreements, economic instruments and incentives, and 
communication strategies.

Reuse and recycling 
The Waste Framework Directive also encourages reuse, recycling 
and recovery, providing a range of options for the recycling of 
various materials including promoting the establishment of 
recycling targets, which can be material-specific. The figures 
show that the average amount of waste per citizen  in the EU is 
approximately 6 tonnes per year. Municipal solid waste alone 
increased from 468 kg per person in 1995 to 524 kg in 2008, 
an increase of 12 per cent, caused by the increasing adoption 
of Western consumption habits in the new Member States (EEA 
2011c). However, EU countries have made measurable progress 
in the efficient use of resources and management of waste, as 
illustrated by the fact that municipal waste recycling more than 
doubled between 1995 and 2008, rising from 17 per cent to  
40 per cent (Figure 11.12) (EEA 2011c, 2010g).
 
Despite such advances, the EU is still not a recycling society, 
given that as of 2008, the share of municipal waste disposed 
of in or on land still exceeded 40 per cent (Figure 11.12) (EEA 
2010g). Based on various macro-economic scenarios, it is 
estimated that by 2035 total waste generation in the EU-27 
will have increased by 60–84 per cent compared to 2003 

Recycling has multiple benefits for many areas of the economy.

levels, although these figures could be significantly revised due 
to the current economic crisis (EEA 2010h).

Eastern Europe shows quite a different picture. In the Russian 
Federation with a population of nearly 143 million, the total

amount of waste generated annually is larger than that of the entire 
EU with a population of 502 million (3.4 billion tonnes and 2.6 
billion tonnes respectively) with 90 per cent of waste originating 
from the mining industry (Eurostat 2011; Devyatkin 2009). On 
average, however, only about 26 per cent of waste is recycled. 
Of this recycled waste, 35 per cent is accounted for by industrial 
waste and only 4–5 per cent by domestic waste. All the other types 
of waste are effectively not recycled at all (Devyatkin 2009).

A life-cycle approach to waste management could significantly 
reduce Europe’s dependence on imports of raw materials 
and energy consumption for manufacturing new materials. 
More significant gains can be made, but only through 
full implementation of the EU’s waste directives and in 
particular the EU Landfill Directive. Reuse and recycling would 
also require significant changes in consumer behaviour, which 
could be helped by information and education campaigns.

Chemicals policy 
The most profound and ambitious piece of legislation regulating 
chemicals in Europe entered into force on 1 June 2007 (EC 2007b). 
This legislation deals with the Registration, Evaluation, 
Authorisation and Restriction of Chemical substances (REACH), 
and replaces a patchwork of previous directives and regulations. 
The seven objectives that are essential for achieving a 
sustainable REACH framework are:
•	 the	protection	of	human	health	and	the	environment;
•	 the	maintenance	and	enhancement	of	the	competitiveness	of	

the EU chemical industry;

•	 the	prevention	of	fragmentation	of	the	EU’s	internal	market;	
•	 increased	transparency;	

Under the EC regulation REACH, manufacturers are required to 
gather and register information on the properties of their chemical 
substances, into a centralized database. © Carsten Madsen/iStock 

308

Part 2: Policy Options

•	 the	integration	with	international	efforts	to	regulate	the 

use of chemicals; 

•	 the	promotion	of	non-animal	testing;	and	
•	 conformity	with	EU	international	obligations	under	the 

World Trade Organization (WTO) (EC 2007b).

One of the most important elements of REACH is the registration 
of chemicals. REACH requires companies that make and/or 
import chemicals to submit registration dossiers to the European 
Chemicals Agency (ECHA). The 2010 registration deadline was 
related to bulk chemicals supplied in quantities of more than 
1 000 tonnes per year and very hazardous chemicals; by the 
REACH deadline of 30 November 2010, the agency had received 
24 675 registration dossiers for 4 300 substances. Despite 
significant concerns raised by the chemicals industry about the 
unprecedented burden REACH placed on companies and some 
initial technical difficulties, the overall registration process 
was a success (ECHA 2010). The future deadlines in 2013 
and 2018 cover chemicals supplied in smaller quantities (EC 
2007b). Additionally, REACH includes some limited provisions 
for the integrated assessment of cumulative risks from multiple 
substances and other stressors.

It is expected that implementation and compliance with this 
legislation will lead to more predictable markets and a reduction 
in companies’ liabilities, especially by providing a level playing 
field for all market players. 

Among new developments is the new EU Toy Safety Directive 
(2009/48/EC), with Member States expected to have had the 
new measures under way as of July 2011, and further parts of the 
directive coming into force in July 2013. Toys come under REACH 
regulations, and the new safety directive focuses in particular 
on limiting the amounts of certain chemicals that may be 
contained in materials used for them. Additionally, in 2013, the 
EU will implement the new regulation on chemical substances in 
cosmetics (1223/2009/EF), aimed at simplifying procedures and 
streamlining terminology. It will also include new provisions for 
nanomaterials and endocrine-disrupting substances. 

The limitations of all these policy options are partly related to 
difficulties in obtaining information on the environmental and 
health risks of chemicals, especially new ones for which the risks 
are unknown. As there may be business issues related to the cost 
of filling knowledge gaps and clarifying uncertainties, there could 
be substantial additional advantages in sharing information 
between the European Chemicals Agency and its counterparts in 
transitional European and developing countries.

Biodiversity
Europeans are at the forefront of establishing multi-national 
conservation efforts (Pullin et al. 2009). A wealth of biodiversity 
conservation policies and tools, including various regional 
conventions, have been applied to European terrestrial and 
marine ecosystems. At supra-national level, biodiversity 
conservation is mainly driven by such EU legal instruments as 
the Nature Directives adopted in 1979 and 1992 (Figure 11.13)

and the pan-European Biological and Landscape Diversity 
Strategy adopted at the Third Ministerial Environment for Europe 
Conference in 1995. Although the EU directives are legally-
binding and Pan-European strategy is not, the two are mutually 
supportive and lead to an improved state of biodiversity in 
Europe. In 2001, the EU and its Member States committed to 
halt the loss of biodiversity by 2010 (CBD 2010a), but this 
target was not met, and the status of biodiversity is still a cause 
for serious concern (EC 2010d). As a result, a new EU 2020 
biodiversity strategy was endorsed in May 2011 (Chapter 5) 
(EC 2011c; CBD 2010b).

For the purpose of this analysis, three policy clusters were 
identified as being beneficial in achieving biodiversity 
conservation goals: 
•	 the	establishment	of	ecological	networks	as	a	key	means	of	

reducing biodiversity loss (Chapter 5);

•	 payment	for	ecosystem	services	as	an	instrument	for	

conserving European agro-biodiversity; and 

•	 the	sustainable	management	of	forest	resources.

(Figure 11.13) (EC 2010d). Similar network approaches also 
apply beyond EU borders (Box 11.9).

The Natura 2000 network
Natura 2000, a tool used by the EU 2020 Biodiversity Strategy, 
represents the largest supra-national network of protected areas 
in the world (EEA 2010f). It incorporates sites established under 
the EU Habitats and Birds Directives and aims to assure the long-
term survival of Europe’s threatened and most valuable species 
and habitats (Fock 2011; Watzold et al. 2010). It has developed 
steadily over the last 15 years, and is now made up of more than 
26 000 sites covering 18 per cent of the EU’s land and sea areas 

The Natura 2000 network helps protect vulnerable habitats 
and species as well as a wide range of ecosystem services, 
including the regulation of climate (such as mitigation of climate 
change), purification of water and maintenance of water flows, 
preservation of landscape and amenity values, and support 
of tourism and recreation (Gantioler et al. 2010; Cliquet et al. 
2009). Furthermore, it facilitates cooperation beyond national 
boundaries, contributes to the decentralization of national-
level conservation policies, and encourages local and regional 

Europe 309

economic development by offering job opportunities and helping 
to attract finance (Ioja et al. 2010; Kluvankova-Oravska et al. 
2009; EC 2008). Even though implementation of the network 
requires around US$8 billion (€6 billion) annually, there are 
several examples demonstrating that the benefits exceed the 
associated costs (Gantioler et al. 2010). 

While the development of the network has made little 
headway with marine environments, it is a real success for 
terrestrial ecosystems (EEA 2010f). The conservation status 
is, however, still only favourable for less than 20 per cent of 
terrestrial habitats and species, both within and outside the 
Natura 2000 network (Figure 11.14) (EEA 2010f). Initially, the 
designation of sites faced a number of problems, but these 
are being overcome through the democratization of multi-
level biodiversity governance (Beijen 2009; Rauschmayer et 
al. 2009). To avoid many sensitive problems in negotiations, 
for example, in 1997 the EC initiated an apolitical process for 
selecting sites in a bio-geographical context through scientific 
seminars where boundaries were agreed (CEEweb 2011; Papp 
and Toth 2004).

Part 2: Policy Options

Box 11.9 Ukraine’s national ecological network 

Natura 2000 has been shown to have a significant influence 
on the development of protected area networks beyond the 
EU. Similar policies have been adopted both by potential 
candidate countries and other Central and Eastern European 
countries (UNEP 2007a). Ukraine, for example, as one of its 
priority strategic directions for biodiversity conservation, 
is trying to follow EU policies and has been developing 
its national ecological network since 2000. Although the 
creation of this network faces a number of challenges, 
including a high degree of agricultural expansion and large-
scale fragmentation of natural landscapes, it has already 
resulted in the establishment of transboundary ecological 
corridors in the Carpathian region. The first corridors were 
established between 2008 and 2010 as part of a project 
to realize transboundary ecological connectivity in the 
Ukrainian Carpathians, linking national parks in Poland, 
Romania and Ukraine. The establishment of these corridors 
received full support not only from forest managers and 
local governments, but also from local communities 
(Deodatus et al. 2010; UNEP 2007a).

Agri-environment measures
The need to preserve high nature-value farmland (Doxa et 
al. 2010; EEA 2009a) in the EU was agreed in 2003 and 
included in the Kyiv Resolution on Biodiversity (UNECE 2003); 
it is also highlighted by the EU as a key action to prevent the 
abandonment or intensification of these lands (EEA 2009a). 

Agri-environment measures, an optional policy tool for farmers 
(Ziolkowska 2009), provide compensation payments covering 
implementation costs and associated income losses to farmers 
who commit to preserving the environment and maintaining 
their farmlands through environmentally friendly practices for 
at least five years (Box 11.10) (Ziolkowska 2009). Under the EU 
Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), Member States are obliged 
to co-finance these measures: between 2007 and 2013, nearly 
22 per cent of the expenditure on rural development, some 
US$27.3 billion (€20 billion), was devoted to them (EC 2010a). 
Securing financial support and avoiding delay in payments is 
necessary to ensure farmer commitment (Whittingham 2007; 
Pinto et al. 2005).

In terms of biodiversity conservation, agri-environment measures 
are at their most successful over large areas (Whittingham 2007), 
where they also contribute to the maintenance and enhancement 
of landscapes, protection of the historic environment and of 
natural resources, and the promotion of public access to the 
countryside (EEA 2009a). Their high costs, however, may limit 
their replicability in non-EU European and developing countries. 
Other limitations to their spread include potential loss of 
income for farmers and the difficulty predicting their effects on 
biodiversity (Ziolkowska 2009; Whittingham 2007). 

Box 11.10 Conserving high nature-value farmland 
in Portugal

On the steppe plains of Castro Verde in southern Portugal, 
the traditional farming system is based on non-irrigated 
extensive cereal production, with a two- or three-year crop 
rotation system. These semi-natural mosaic steppe habitats 
are of value for the conservation of nature, particularly 
the great bustard (Otis tarda). In 1993, a project under EU 
LIFE – a financial instrument supporting environmental 
and nature conservation – was implemented to support 
the preservation of these birds and their habitats by 
acquiring several farms, leaving the fields fallow, and 
raising awareness among farmers and landowners. Then, 
in 1995, an EU agri-environment plan was defined so that 
the farmers could continue their traditional management 
practices, rotating crops and maintaining low livestock 
densities. By 1999 the bird population had improved 
to such an extent that Castro Verde was included in the 
Natura 2000 network as a special protected area for birds. 
Assuring the maintenance and effectiveness of such 
projects is an essential element in meeting long-term 
conservation priorities. In this case, however, the agri-
environment scheme has not proved popular as delays in 
subsidy payments led to some farmers withdrawing from 
the plan (Pinto et al. 2005).

Forest Europe
Although forests currently (2010) cover 45 and 38 per cent of 
Europe’s and the EU-27’s territory respectively, only 26 and 4 per 
cent of these forests are considered to be undisturbed by humans 
(Figure 11.15) (Forest Europe et al. 2011). Most European forests 
are heavily exploited and the share of old-growth stands, crucial 
for forest species, is critically low. Nonetheless, Europe’s total 
forest area is increasing thanks to national policy initiatives 
coordinated in the Forest Europe framework – a voluntary 
pan-European policy process for establishing sustainable 
management of the region’s forests.

The Forest Europe process develops common strategies to 
meet challenges such as climate change and the protection of 
biodiversity and freshwater, both in Europe and globally (EEA 
2010h, 2010a). Since 1990, it has established a collaborative 
research network on forest ecosystems, a set of pan-European 
criteria and indicators for sustainable forest management, and a 
series of action programmes tackling cross-sectoral cooperation 
and national forest programmes (EEA 2008). Sustainable forest 
management, as defined by the Ministerial Conference on 
the Protection of Forests in Europe, has been recognized as a 
commendable example of the ecosystem approach advocated by 
the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) (EEA 2008).

The benefits of Forest Europe include harmonization of forest 
policies in European countries that aim to achieve goals for

protecting biodiversity, combating illegal logging and certifying 
carbon sequestration. Europe has gained 5.1 million hectares of 
forest since 2005 (Forest Europe et al. 2011), and between 2005 
and 2010 about 870 million tonnes of CO2 were removed annually 
from the atmosphere by photosynthesis and tree biomass growth, 
about half of it in the EU-27 (Forest Europe et al. 2011).

is increasingly being taken into account. Even if such policies 
still have one environmental theme as an entry point, they 
increasingly cover wide ranges of related aspects. The recent 
2009 EU Climate and Energy Package exemplifies such an 
integrated approach, including binding legislation to achieve 
three linked targets (the 20-20-20 targets).

Efforts to enhance the sustainability of forests through 
management face a lack of national capacity and awareness, and 
intensifying competition in international forest product markets. 
There is therefore an urgent need for transnational coordination 
to address common and cross-border issues (Hogl 2002). 
National differences also reflect the different roles of forests in 
various countries and the resulting political need to establish 
official forest programmes. 

The absence of a legally binding agreement on forests at a pan-
European level cannot be considered a limitation to successful 
policy implementation, but at some point it could slow the 
process down, as common benchmarks and well-defined targets 
for evaluating effectiveness and efficiency are lacking. In order to 
improve and accelerate the process, in June 2011 the Ministerial 
Conference on the Protection of Forests in Europe adopted 
the Oslo Ministerial Mandate for Negotiating a Legally Binding 
Agreement on Forests in Europe.

CONCLUSIONS 
One of the main conclusions of this chapter is that the 
coherent application of effective policies across themes and 
sectors can bring major benefits in terms of an improved 
physical environment and a healthier population. In European 
environmental governance, the integration of effective policies 
under multiple environmental themes and economic sectors 

It is through such integrated policies that multiple co-benefits 
can be obtained most cost effectively. Industrial CO2 emission 
reduction through emissions trading, for example, will at 
the same time improve ambient air quality; and promoting 
renewable energy systems will not only reduce CO2 emissions, 
but will also decentralize energy production, potentially 
improve energy security and provide employment opportunities 
and economic growth in small and medium-sized companies. 
Likewise, climate adaptation programmes will increase 
resilience to climate change effects such as flooding, drought, 
loss of biodiversity and increased vulnerability to disease, while 
at the same time improving ambient air quality and reducing 
greenhouse gas emissions, for example through adjusted 
agricultural practices, which will also contribute to more 
sustainable agriculture.

Experience shows that limitations can be overcome if the 
right enabling regimes are put in place. Common barriers to 
implementing the policy tools discussed in this chapter are: 
•	 a	lack	of	good	data	and	information	to	assess	impacts	and	

risks and thus support decision making; 

•	 insufficient	financial	resources	from	the	private	and	public	
sectors for dealing with environmental issues both in the 
EU countries affected by the financial crisis and in non-EU 
European countries;

•	 a	lack	of	systematic	law	enforcement;

312

Part 2: Policy Options

•	 traditional	consumption-oriented	economic	policies	that	

contradict the imperative of more sustainable consumption 
and hinder the decoupling of human well-being from 
economic growth;

•	 intensifying	competition	in	international	product	markets;	and
•	 increasing	egoism,	diminished	community	solidarity	and	an	
increasing, though often unjustifiable, sense of community 
disconnection and insecurity.

Enabling conditions that would increase policy success and 
replication are:
•	 more	policy	coherence,	streamlining	and	simplified	

procedures that enhance cost efficiency and effectiveness;

•	 more	efficient	monitoring	systems;
•	 stronger	long-term	commitment	on	the	part	of	politicians	and	

governments;

•	 stronger	enforcement;
•	 transnational	coordination	to	address	common	and	cross-

border issues; 

•	 stronger	private-sector	involvement	by	creating	and	making	

better use of markets; and

•	 a	more	active	civil	society	engaged	through	awareness	raising	

and strong multi-stakeholder agreements.

Promising emerging innovative policies relevant to the themes 
covered in this chapter that would help to improve European 
environmental governance further and would foster scale-up and 
replication include:
Climate change
•	 the	EU	Effort	Sharing	Decision,	which	establishes	binding	
emission targets for 2013 –2020 for transport, agriculture, 
buildings and waste, all sectors that are currently not covered 
by the EU Emissions Trading System;

•	 the	encouragement	of	transnational	voluntary	networks	
for local action on climate change and air quality, which 
are actively spreading in Europe and are focusing on more 
sustainable urban lifestyles, such as Local Governments 
for Sustainability (ICLEI), Cities for Climate Protection, the 
Climate Alliance, Energy Cities,  CIVITAS and the Aalborg 
Charter.
Air quality
•	 devolving	responsibility	in	local	air	quality	management	

to local administrations, facilitating identification and 
implementation of policies. 

Freshwater
•	 the	EC’s	expected	2012	Blueprint	to	safeguard	Europe’s	water	

resources, which will focus on prevention and preparedness 
in relation to river basin management, water scarcity and 
drought, and vulnerability to climate change. 

Chemicals and waste
•	 the	proposed	mandatory	target	under	the	Waste	Electrical	

and Electronic Equipment Directive to recycle 65 per cent of 
such waste – currently only some 34 per cent is recycled;

•	 the	forthcoming	EU	regulations	on	toys	to	increase	protection	

of the most vulnerable (children);

•	 the	forthcoming	EU	Cosmetics	Directive,	to	ensure	adequate	
protection from endocrine disruptors and nanomaterials; and

Renewable energies will play a crucial role in the transition to a low-carbon 
economy; wind alone already accounted for 41 per cent of new power 
installations in Europe in 2010. © Mlenny Photography/iStock

•	 new	measure	to	address	the	integrated	assessment	of	

cumulative risks from multiple substances and other stressors, 
filling a main gap in current regulations covering chemicals.

Biodiversity
•	 the	expected	adoption	of	a	new	Pan-European	Biological	and	
Landscape Diversity Strategy 2020, aligned with CBD targets, 
will reinforce the EU 2020 Biodiversity Strategy;

•	 the	common	integrated	framework	in	support	of	the	EU	2020	

Biodiversity Strategy, involving a wide range of services 
and ministries, will create ownership across all relevant 
policy areas and stakeholders beyond the traditional 
biodiversity community. 

In summary, European examples of regional cooperation on 
the environment have served as a model for other countries 
and regions and can potentially serve in the future. Features 
include current formal institutional structures and the tradition 
of legislating to improve state and trends in various realms in an 
integrated way, though as contexts vary adjustments may need to 
be made in other parts of the world.

Ongoing European attempts strive for continually improving 
environmental governance, underpinned by strong civil society 
participation and the recognized right of access to environmental 
information and justice in environmental matters as laid down 
in the Aarhus Convention, to date only applied in Europe. These 
efforts are essential for a proper and robust treatment of the 
shared environmental space and a healthy future for all.

Main Messages 

Despite their heterogeneity, countries in Latin 
America and the Caribbean share a number of 
common environmental challenges. These include 
climate change, biodiversity loss and concerns over 
water and land management. Coastal and marine 
issues, urbanization, poverty and inequity are also of 
high priority.

The policies and instruments showcased in this 
chapter require sound environmental governance 
to ensure their effectiveness. Strong institutional 
settings and policy frameworks are the foundation 
for this, while public participation, monitoring 
and evaluation, education, and a culture of 
environmental awareness are fundamental for its 
efficient functioning.

Policies in the region can only be effective if they 
succeed in bridging the gap between science and 
policy making. Robust policies rest on evidence-
based research designed to meet the needs of 
policy makers. Such research should include, where 
relevant, local and indigenous knowledge, which is 
an important feature of the region. Researchers and 
policy makers need to collaborate to acquire the 

relevant information, knowledge and innovation 
for environmental decision making.

To be sustainable, the region’s natural capital 
needs to be managed in an integrated fashion 
across sectors. To respond to the complex nature 
of the region’s environment and its opportunities 
and challenges, policies should be designed  
and implemented in ways that transcend the 
traditional compartmentalized, sectoral approach. 
This will help the region deal with some of its 
persistent environmental and associated socio-
economic problems, including poverty, inequity 
and social conflict.

The Latin America and Caribbean region has 
developed and implemented good examples of 
transformative policies and approaches. These are 
usually at national and sub-national levels and offer 
opportunities for replication both within and outside 
the region. Their characteristics usually include the 
effective incorporation of scientific information, 
knowledge and best practice, links across sectors, 
and strong governance mechanisms, stakeholder 
participation, and political will and support.

INTRODUCTION
The 33 countries of Latin America and the Caribbean vary 
significantly in size and economic development. The region 
includes both Brazil, the seventh largest economy in the world 
(The Economist 2011) and small island developing states, with 
their open and fragile economies (Rietbergen et al. 2007). Rich 
in natural resources, the region is home to approximately 23 per 
cent of the world’s forests, 31 per cent of its freshwater resources 
and six of the world’s 17 mega-diverse countries. Although these 
resources are not evenly distributed, the overall richness and 
economic importance of the region’s ecosystems and its natural 
capital are undeniable (UNEP 2010b). 

Latin American and Caribbean countries face many challenges 
in managing their rich natural resources. Population growth, 
as well as unsustainable global and regional production and 
consumption patterns, drive the increasing demand for, and 
extraction of raw materials and other natural capital (Chapter 1). 
This has led to the extensive conversion of natural environments 
to productive systems, with impacts on the region’s biodiversity. 

With 79 per cent of its population living in towns and cities (UNEP 
2010b), the region is one of the most urbanized in the world. It 
faces challenges in providing its burgeoning towns and cities with 
safe water and sanitation, and in addressing air pollution and the 
contamination of its freshwater, oceans and seas. The associated 
competition for scarce resources and the inequitable distribution 
of benefits have led to emerging socio-environmental conflicts 
and risks to the traditional lifestyles and livelihoods of local and 
indigenous communities. 

Global climate change exacerbates many of the region’s existing 
problems. Extreme weather patterns and climatic events are 
increasing in frequency and intensity, and sea levels are rising. 
The impacts are already affecting the region’s most vulnerable 
groups, including its small island developing states and many 

rural, indigenous and poor populations. Thus, it is ever more 
important to use water resources efficiently and to conserve 
and sustain terrestrial, coastal and marine ecosystems. The 
challenge, however, is great, and the region is far from achieving 
some of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) (UN 2010a). 
Given the current situation, including poverty throughout Latin 
America and the Caribbean, there is an urgent need to implement 
more effective measures to halt and reverse the region’s negative 
environmental trends (UN 2010a).

The region has many laws relating to the environment but, at the 
same time, the lack of institutional management and capacity to 
implement and enforce them has constrained their effectiveness 
(UNEP 2010b). In addition, policies are not keeping pace with 
production practices or adapting sufficiently to global trends 
and integration (UNEP 2011a). To address these challenges, 
governments need a stronger commitment to new policies and 
to making existing policies and mechanisms more effective. 
Certain countries are progressing in incorporating new policy 
mechanisms, such as valuation of ecosystem services, payment 
for ecosystem services, climate-compatible development, 
innovative green financing mechanisms, and sound corporate 
practices, to name a few. Some progress is also being made in 
developing national environmental/sustainable development 
strategies that take both cross-sectoral and multi-stakeholder 
views into account (Bovarnick et al. 2010; UNEP 2010b). These 
positive lessons are a starting point for considering the options 
available to the region’s policy makers. 

This chapter highlights policies considered to have the highest 
potential for increasing environmental sustainability and 
associated human well-being. A number of interrelated themes 
have been selected as priorities: environmental governance; water 
management; biodiversity; soil, land use, land degradation and 
desertification; and climate change. Sustainable management of 
oceans and seas is also important, especially to the region’s small 

Latin America and the Caribbean is the most urbanized region in the developing world. While urbanization exerts great pressure on natural 
resources and ecosystems, properly managed cities can also be part of the solution to global environmental challenges. © Aurelio Scetta

islands (Mahon et al. 2011), so coastal and marine issues are also 
addressed. The following section appraises a number of policy 
options for the region according to the selected themes, and also 
addresses key points related to marine and coastal policy. 

POLICY APPRAISAL
Environmental governance
Environmental governance (Box 12.1; Figure 12.1) has been 
identified as a priority theme for the region and is treated as cross-
cutting with respect to the other selected environmental themes. 
This reflects the fact that sound environmental governance will 
ultimately reverse environmental degradation and help achieve 
the MDG targets and many multilateral environmental agreements. 

Regional context
Governance of the environment and natural resources in Latin 
America and the Caribbean is a complex mosaic. This stems from 
the wide diversity of governance systems with different degrees

Environmental policy and institutional frameworks, and 
the relationships between them, provide the essential 
foundation of a governance framework. Sound policy 
frameworks include a set of environmental norms, 
policies and regulations at various levels – international, 
hemispheric, regional, sub-regional, national – as well as 
multilateral and bilateral environmental agreements. 

Institutional settings also include civil society and the 
private sector and the interactions between them. It 
is important to note that the existence of policies and 
institutional frameworks alone does not guarantee good 
environmental governance.

of institutional development and approaches to environmental 
issues, and different levels of governance mechanisms and 
performance (Box 12.2). Regional and sub-regional mechanisms 
play an important role in environmental management, although 
in many cases the environment is not their main focus.

In recent decades, most Latin American and Caribbean countries 
have developed national environmental legal and institutional 
frameworks to formulate strategies and action plans for 
sustainable natural resource use and environmental protection 
(UNEP 2010b; Larson 2003). In addition, countries have begun 
to adopt a more cross-sectoral approach, with other agencies 
considering environmental issues in addition to those directly 
responsible for the environment. Despite these achievements, 
a limited capacity to implement and enforce existing legislation 
and poor institutional arrangements constrain effectiveness 
(UNEP 2010b). The weak development of environmental policies 
in the face of economic, financial, commercial and technological 
globalization has aggravated the situation (UNEP 2011c). 
Managing national environmental policies and balancing 
internal priorities among other sectoral needs, while engaging 
in multilateral efforts through multilateral environmental 
agreements, constitutes a major challenge for the region. 

Another concern is policy and institutional continuity, which 
is especially important for environmental issues (Emilsson  
et al. 2004). The timescales over which policies, programmes and 
projects are realized do not always coincide with those of political 
terms of office. Options to strengthen the political authority of 
environmental agencies and maintain essential medium- to long-
term efforts include longer terms of office and greater autonomy 
for technical environmental officers, and creative financing 
mechanisms to facilitate political independence. 

A number of other requirements for good environmental 
governance must still be met in the region; these are briefly 
examined in the sections that follow. 

Box 12.2 Levels of governance in Latin America and 
the Caribbean

Governance mechanisms occur at a number of levels: 
the hemispheric level, through the Forum of Ministers of 
Environment of Latin America and the Caribbean, and at the 
Wider Caribbean level through the Cartagena Convention 
on the Protection of the Wider Caribbean Sea; the sub-
regional level, as reflected in regional integration movements 
including the Central America Integration System (SICA), 
the Caribbean Common Market (CARICOM), the Andean 
Community (CAN) and the Common Market of the South 
(MERCOSUR); and at the national level. In addition, there 
are specific frameworks to manage shared resources, such 
as the Amazon Cooperation Treaty and many river basin 
organizations.

Enabling factors for more effective environmental governance
For effective and efficient functioning, a number of enabling 
conditions should support policy and institutional frameworks, 
including adequate financial resources, scientific research 
and information, environmental education and a culture of 
environmental awareness. In addition, standard governance 
principles and values such as transparency, accountability, 
equity, sustainability and inclusive stakeholder participation 
should underpin any governance framework (Mahon et al. 2010; 
Gaventa and Valderrama 1999).

Policies for generating and disseminating information foster a 
better understanding of environmental conditions, problems and 
potential solutions and improve the science-policy interface. 
Reliable and timely information allows decision makers to 
respond appropriately and thus improves decision making (Table 
12.1a). Where relevant, this information should also incorporate 
indigenous/local knowledge (Table 12.1b). To influence policy 
and decision making effectively, environmental information 
should be transformed into easily understood, scientifically 
derived indicators to convey clear messages to policy makers

The Regional Biodiversity Monitoring and Evaluation Programme (PROMEBIO) has been formulated as a 
regional programmatic instrument to generate information that enables the management of biodiversity 
and natural resources, helps the various key stakeholders and decision makers at both regional and 
national levels to incorporate the issue into their strategic agendas and decisions, and makes a significant 
contribution to the process of environmental integration in Central America (CCAD-UNDP/GEF 2005).
Bird Caye National Park and Gladden Spit Marine Reserve are co-managed by Friends of Nature, a local 
non-governmental organization, through agreements with the government authority – the Forestry and 
Fisheries Department. Friends of Nature manages the areas, enforcing fishing rules and regulations, which 
enhances policy effectiveness through local legitimacy and reduces tension between local fishers and federal 
authorities. Links to fishing communities and international research organizations facilitate the combination 
of scientific and local knowledge for improved understanding of local environmental conditions (Gray 2008).

Environmental justice in practice: the

Argentina

In the Mexican state of Morelos, a new system of formal environmental education has been developed 
focused on the particularities and features of the natural environment surrounding the public schools. This 
programme has proved to be of interest to educators, environmental activists and international organizations 
worldwide (Hurtado Badiola 2008).
In 2005, the National Environmental Authority (ANAM) implemented an e-government web-based platform 
that allows public access to proposed regulations, environmental studies, scientific reports and other key 
documents including administrative fines and complaints. This is fostering active interaction with non-
governmental organizations, the media and the general public (ANAM 2009).

Co-management of resources is aptly demonstrated in the Mankòtè Mangrove in Saint Lucia, where 
participatory and collaborative approaches and methods have been used for reconciling economic and other 
human activities with conservation imperatives (Brown and Renard 2000).
These are private-public, long-term financial partnerships to protect critical watersheds, attracting 
voluntary contributions from large downstream water users who benefit from upstream water preservation 
activities including reforestation, ecotourism and water-flow monitoring. They also support green economic 
opportunities with a positive impact on local communities, such as sustainable farming (Calvache et al. 2011).

This system adjusts national accounts to reflect environmental damage and the depletion of natural 
resources, such as water and minerals, which cost Mexico nearly US$90 billion annually, or 8% of the 
country’s gross domestic product (GDP) from 2005 to 2009 (INEGI 2011). This is attributed to the globalization 
of markets, weak and poorly implemented policies and failure to enforce existing laws

The Caribbean Sea Commission, established by the Association of Caribbean States (ACS) in 2006, was set up 
to help advance work on the Caribbean Sea Initiative. This body has the potential to bring greater coherence 
to the policies and other governance structures associated with the Caribbean Sea (Mahon et al. 2011).

In Peru, the Manual for Investigating Environmental Crimes has been developed as a tool for obligatory use by 
environmental prosecutors. It is intended to guide investigation and punishment of environmental crimes in 
the Peruvian Amazon and other key ecosystems, as well as to bring greater coherence to approaches aimed at 
environmental crime prevention (Avina 2011).
Positive steps were made in resolving a decades-old pollution problem in the Riachuelo watershed of Buenos 
Aires with the ruling adopted by the Supreme Court of Argentina in the Mendoza case. Residents sued the 
federal government for damage to their health, resulting in a ruling that held the City of Buenos Aires and the 
federal government responsible for the damage to and reparation of the watershed, and the setting up of an 
authority to address the environmental health issues. This authority has embarked on a range of clean-up and 
restoration efforts (Staveland-Saeter 2011; di Filippo 2000).

Latin America and the Caribbean 321

Since the early 1990s, most countries have incorporated 
provisions for citizen participation in environmental legislation 
or in thematic or sectoral laws and have created a variety of 
citizen participation councils (Gaventa and Valderrama 1999). 
Although national and local regulations have standards for public 
participation, including those for a variety of instruments such as 
public hearings and consultations, implementing them effectively 
continues to be a challenge. 

Co-management is one of the most effective and efficient 
approaches to incorporating public interests in environmental 
decision making (Moreno-Sánchez and Maldonado 2008). The 
co-management of protected areas and watersheds by local 
communities, civil society organizations, indigenous peoples 
and even the private sector, has become a model of stakeholder 
participation. This approach has been widely adopted in such 
areas as biodiversity conservation and forest management (Table 
12.1b, e). For example, public-private partnerships used in 
tandem with economic incentives to protect critical watersheds 
are evident in a number of countries (Table 12.1f).

In many cases, however, citizens are only consulted at the very 
end of the decision-making process. This has exacerbated 
conflicts that integrated water resources management and 
multi-scale land-use planning are designed to prevent or resolve, 
including conflicts over water resources and land tenure. It is 
increasingly clear that there is a need for mechanisms to ensure 
accountability and transparency to reduce the risk of corruption 
in decision-making processes and to increase financial flows to 
environmental programmes (Transparency International 2010). 

Negative externalities resulting from market forces are often 
considered a driving force of adverse environmental change. 
Thus, in developing future environmental policies in the 
region, it is of utmost importance to recognize the economic 
value of ecosystem services. An appreciation of the market 
value of ecosystem services, which reflects the link between 
the environment and human well-being in monetary terms, 
helps promote an environmental culture and improves the 
political viability of environmental protection. The use of 
economic incentives encourages citizens and businesses to 
make decisions based on the true long-term economic value of 
nature and the services it provides. Examples include Reducing 
Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation and 
additionally for conserving and sustainably managing forests 
and enhancing forest carbon stocks (REDD+); payment for 
ecosystem services such as the Fund for the Protection of Water 
in Peru (Table 12.2b); and feed-in tariffs to support renewable 
energy. Valuing natural assets economically also allows decision 
makers in the public and private sectors to optimize their cost-
benefit analyses and may be used to adjust national accounts 
and other economic indicators (Table 12.1g). Other tools, such 
as green funds and environmental taxes, can be used to raise 
funds for cash-strapped environmental agencies and causes. 
For example, the Trinidad and Tobago Green Fund couples both 
sets of tools to fund biodiversity preservation and ecosystem 
management (Table 12.3j). 

Costa Rica has been a pioneer and leader among Latin American 
countries in the design and development of systems of payment for 
environmental services. © Francisco Romero/iStock

and the public (UNESCO-SCOPE 2006; Cimorelli and Stahl 2005). 
Importantly, information should not be policy prescriptive 
but policy relevant, and should provide decision makers with 
alternatives and associated scenarios (Watson 2005).

Relevant information and indicators also help in monitoring 
and evaluating the effectiveness of policies and determining 
if they have allowed management approaches to adapt to new 
conditions; these are important elements of good environmental 
governance. Good monitoring and evaluation programmes need 
to consider appropriate time frames and adequate baselines, and 
focus on results-based management using appropriate indicators. 
While well established in internationally sponsored projects 
(Pasteur and Blauert 2000), planned participatory monitoring 
and evaluation systems should also be used in government-run 
initiatives to quantify results and enable adaptive management. 
It is important that, in addition to quantitative scientific 
information, monitoring and evaluation regimes include social, 
political and cultural qualitative data to assess results and 
develop methods to improve policy effectiveness (Stem et al. 
2005). Indicators may be process-based to measure progress or 
outcome-based to measure effectiveness, and should include the 
evaluation criteria of coverage, effectiveness, sustainability and 
replication (GEF 2011).

Environmental education gives people a greater sense of 
responsibility and increases awareness of the consequences 
of their actions. It promotes an environmentally conscious 
culture that helps to overcome a general lack of environmental 
awareness, one of the main causes of adverse change. 
Furthermore, an environmentally aware culture potentially 
improves public participation and increases public support for 
initiatives (Table 12.1c, d). For example, increased environmental 
awareness is credited with greater public support for developing 
payment for ecosystem services in Costa Rica (UNDP 2011).

Effective environmental governance, especially in the context 
of complex systems, requires that stakeholders collaborate and 
cooperate; it also requires coordination and harmonization 
of institutions, policies and other instruments. A number of 
platforms and mechanisms have been established to facilitate 
greater collaboration and coordination and improve coherence 
among governance systems, although these vary in nature, scale 
and level of success. One such mechanism is the Caribbean Sea 
Commission (Table 12.1h), which is one of several initiatives 
under way to strengthen the cohesiveness of the approximately 
30 organizations involved from the sub-regional to the 
international level in coastal and marine management in the 
Caribbean Sea (Mahon et al. 2011). A multi-scale governance 
framework is proposed for this large marine ecosystem by 
Fanning et al. (2007), which accommodates the diversity of policy 
cycles at multiple levels and the links between them (Figure 
12.2). Such a framework could be adapted for other ecosystems 
or environmental issues.

Environmental justice is “the fair treatment and meaningful 
involvement of all people regardless of race, colour, 
national origin, or income with respect to the development, 
implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws, 
regulations, and policies” (USEPA 2011). In recent decades, 
several Latin American and Caribbean countries have made 
significant progress in environmental justice, particularly by 
enacting specialized procedures and mechanisms, as well as  
by enhancing the capacity of judiciaries; in some cases, this 
has included establishing specialized tribunals, for example the 
Tribunal Ambiental Administrativo in Costa Rica, and designating 
environmental prosecutors (Table 12.1i).

Although there are positive examples of judicial rulings in the 
region (Table 12.1j), there are still many challenges to improving 

environmental justice, including institutional and legislative 
weaknesses, low public participation and lack of awareness and 
information about people’s environmental rights. 

The emerging role of the judiciary is also important. In many 
countries, civil society organizations, prosecutors and individual 
citizens are using the judicial system to defend environmental 
rights. This occurs mostly through constitutional courts, but also in 
criminal and civil courts. In addition, the justice system has been 
proactive in resolving technically and legally complex disputes by 
overcoming procedural obstacles and adapting traditional legal 
institutions to the specifics of environmental law. The judiciary still 
needs to develop a considerable amount of capacity in addressing 
environmental issues, however, particularly by training legal 
professionals, especially lawyers and prosecutors.

Conclusion
Environmental governance should be viewed as a cross-cutting 
theme across all the other priority issues identified in Latin 
America and the Caribbean. Despite its complex environmental 
governance mechanisms, the region has made significant 
progress in developing national environmental legal and 
institutional frameworks. Poor institutional arrangements and 
a limited capacity for implementation and enforcement, among 
other deficiencies, however, have hampered their effectiveness. 
A number of enabling conditions need to accompany these 
frameworks including adequate financial resources, scientific 
research and information dissemination, environmental education 
and an improved environmental culture. They also involve the 
standard governance principles and values of transparency, 
accountability, equity, sustainability and inclusive stakeholder 
participation. Such good governance can help reverse the current 
trend in environmental degradation and help to achieve the targets 
of the MDGs and many multilateral environmental agreements.

Water
The availability of clean water in sufficient quantities and of 
sufficient quality was declared a human right by UN Decision 
64/292 and is recognized in the constitutions of some Latin 
American and Caribbean countries. This section describes a set 
of policy options, presented in clusters, that intend to provide 
guidance for decisions about water provision and consumption. 
They were identified as potential options to address the 
Johannesburg Plan of Implementation Paragraph 26c (WSSD 
2002), selected as the region’s internationally agreed goal 
related to water. 

Integrated water resources management 
Integrated water resources management has been widely 
acknowledged as a way of achieving long-term solutions to 
water problems because of its interdisciplinary approach. Its 
implementation in developing countries, however, has been 
rather slow (UN-Water 2008). Integrated policies include those 
associated with: 
•	 strengthened	water	governance;	
•	 application	of	economic	and	financial	instruments;	and
•	 improvement	of	information	on	water	quality	and	quantity.

Latin America and the Caribbean 323

Strengthened governance is both a cause and effect of an 
holistic view of water management because it implies a balance 
between public interest and the rights of the individual. 
Economic instruments and information are key tools in managing 
complex situations such as water scarcity, water-use conflicts 
and pollution. Economic instruments include mechanisms to 
change the culture of water use, such as economic valuation 
and the polluter-pays principle. Information gathering, including 
outputs from indicators and monitoring processes, supports the 
management of supply and demand and also helps to sustain 

traditional knowledge about the links between water, people and 
the environment. Finally, in the context of climate change, water-
related information systems to prevent disasters and manage risk 
are increasingly important for the region (Table 12.2a, b, c).

Integrated approaches to water management enable resources 
and capabilities to be used in an efficient, cost-effective and 
sustainable way, which is ever more important as demand for 
water increases with population growth, and as the impacts 
of climate change are felt. Other benefits include fewer

Several community organizations in the peri-urban areas of the city of Cochabamba have engaged in different ways 
of guaranteeing the water supply for domestic consumption. The result is a network of providers, distributors, 
committees and various types of arrangements that alleviate basic needs. At the same time, a metropolitan area 
master plan is under development (GIZ/PROAPAC 2011).
The Fund for the Protection of Water (FONAG) is a trust fund to which water users in Quito, Ecuador, contribute. This 
fund is used to co-finance activities, projects and programmes for the rehabilitation and conservation of 65 000 
hectares of watersheds that supply Quito and surrounding areas. Similar funds have been developed in Colombia 
and Peru (Cisneros and Lloret 2008). 
Water is one of the components of the National Environmental Indicators system. This uses indicators for 
situational assessments of water resources in terms of availability and quality. Indicators reflect pressures on the 
availability for different uses, its state, and action being taken to preserve water. Also reflected by the indicators 
are factors that affect water quality, the condition of water bodies in the country, and action being taken to stop 
their deterioration and allow recovery (SEMARNAT 2009).

Rainwater harvesting is one of the most successful water management practices in the region because of its 
relatively low cost and its technical feasibility for multiple uses. In the Caribbean, rainwater harvesting is a source 
of water for around 500 000 people. Brazil has a programme for the construction of a million rural cisterns; Mexico 
and Peru have capacity-building and demonstration centres (CEHI/GWP-C 2010; GWP-C 2010; UNEP 2010b; Colegio 
de Postgraduados 2004).
Traditional projects to enhance irrigation systems used to focus mainly on improving the collection, transmission 
and distribution of water, with water use at the plot level seldom addressed. Recent projects have contributed to 
the efficiency of irrigation systems, increasing water availability at the plot level by up to 50% by means of best 
practices in surface irrigation and with adequate technology (PROAGRO/GTZ/DED 2010). 

The condominium sewerage system was developed in Brasilia and Salvador de Bahia as a mechanism to expand 
sewer services for 1.5 million condominium residents. One of the benefits of this policy is that providers and users 
need to reach an agreement to facilitate service expansion and adaptation to local needs. Thus, the condominium 
becomes not only a physical unit of service provision, but a social unit for facilitated collective decisions and the 
organization of communal action. Additionally, this system provides a discount of 40% on the standard sewerage 
charge for households (Melo 2005). 

The Coastal Zone Management Unit in Barbados, established 25 years ago, has two strategic objectives: 
•	 sustainable	use	of	the	coastal	management	area	by	implementing	policies	that	maintain	and,	where	possible,	

enhance environmental quality while still enabling economic development; and

•	 an	effective	legal	and	administrative	structure	to	implement	integrated	coastal	management.

Pursuing its objectives, the unit works with the Town and Country Development Planning Office. The unit provides 
technical expertise to make an informed and just assessment when the site chosen for development falls within 
the coastal zone management area (CZMU Barbados 2011). 
The management plan of the Guapi-Iscuande Integrated Management Unit has enabled ecosystem conservation, 
support to communities, and rational and alternative use of environmental resources by all involved stakeholders. 
The plan started in 2000 and has helped to design environmental agendas with local communities including 
indigenous and ethnic groups, as well as fostering the creation of a local committee for integrated coastal zone 
management (INVEMAR 2011). 
This regional policy framework, which entered into force in 1986, is a comprehensive, umbrella agreement for 
the protection and development of the marine environment. The convention is supplemented by three protocols: 
the Protocol Concerning Co-operation in Combating Oil Spills; the Protocol Concerning Specially Protected Areas 
and Wildlife; and the Protocol Concerning Pollution from Land-Based Sources and Activities (UNEP-CEP 2011a; 
UNEP 2000).

water-related conflicts, such as in managing transboundary 
basins and other competing uses; increased participation 
of stakeholders in decision making – including women, 
indigenous groups and other minorities – that can help reduce 
marginality and inequity and promotes transparency and 
accountability; increased water conservation and sustainable 
distribution; decision making and policy formulation based 
on evidence and traditional knowledge; and appropriate basin 
management that contributes to land-use planning policies, 
helps address issues of food security, ecosystem protection 
and waste management, and reduces transaction costs in water 
chains (Dalhuisen and Nijkamp 2002).

Integrated water resources management has only been 
implemented in Latin America and the Caribbean in a limited 
way due to fragmented and conflicting institutional mandates, 
lack of skilled human resources, inadequate mechanisms for 
effective public participation, lack of sustainable financing 
and harmonization mechanisms, and a lack of structures and 
procedures to gather and present data.

Enabling conditions to promote integrated management include:
•	 water	policy	reform,	including	legislation	and	standards;	

•	 water	governance,	including	institutional	frameworks	to	

monitor and enforce legislation, development of institutional 
capacity to design and implement integrated management 
plans, projects and long-term programmes at different scales, 
and greater engagement and use of local knowledge through 
basin committees; 

•	 land	register	development,	stable	governance	arrangements,	

low transaction costs, credible enforcement arrangements 
and clearly defined rights and/or entitlements for land and 
water use; 

•	 developing	government	capacity	to	collect	tax	revenues,	so	
that funds can be efficiently and equitably allocated to water 
programmes and projects; and 

•	 education	and	information	programmes	(UNEP	2011c).

Sustainable water provision and consumption
The Latin America and Caribbean region has 31 per cent of the 
world’s freshwater resources (UNEP 2010b). However, given 
the region’s rate of population growth, rapid urbanization 
and current patterns of water use (UNEP 2010b), sustaining 
ecosystem services and an adequate water supply for future 
generations is an increasingly important issue. Investment in 
infrastructure is necessary, but it alone is not enough to solve

the problem of water supply and demand. There is need for a 
change in policy making and management approaches, from 
those based exclusively on managing supply to the inclusion  
of both supply and demand management (Jouravley 
2001). Among users, there is need for a cultural change 
through education and economic incentives. Two main policy 
options may be considered: 
•	 conservation	and	restoration	of	water-supplying	ecosystems;		
•	 promotion	of	water-use	efficiency	in	human	consumption	and	

production activities.

Ecosystems provide a wide range of services within a watershed. 
Thus, establishing and maintaining the minimum amount 
of water they require (environmental flows) is vital to ensure 
a balanced hydrological cycle and a constant water supply. 
In areas where resources are heavily exploited, improved 
water-use efficiency is urgently needed through technological 
developments and by applying traditional and scientific 
knowledge (Table 12.2d, e). This fosters measures to adapt 
to climate change as well as reducing costs for water users. 
Investments in water-use efficiency include the control of 
unaccounted water at the grid level, installation of water-saving 
appliances, reuse and recycling systems, rainwater harvesting 
and water-saving irrigation systems, among others. Although 
initial investments are high, reduced water use translates into 
reduced costs in the long term.

Despite notable progress, a significant portion of the region’s most vulnerable people – largely in the growing number of informal settlements, 
or favelas – still lack access to clean water and sanitation systems. © Luoman/iStock

Overall water policy needs reform to ensure that the policies 
proposed here do not remain isolated projects or campaigns, 
but have long-term effects. It is thus important to develop the 
political will to adopt legislation that will effect positive change 
through encouraging incentives and enforcing penalties. There 
must be economic incentives such as access to loans with 
low interest rates and equitable conditions, as well as water-
efficiency certification schemes. Management committees, civil 
society and multi-stakeholder participation are key to success. 
In summary, sustainable water supply and demand can be 
achieved when the economic, cultural and social value of water

To achieve MDG 7, 92.5 per cent of the population of Latin 
America and the Caribbean must have access to safe drinking 
water and 84.5 per cent to basic sanitation by the end of 2015 
(WHO and UNICEF 2010). According to the most recent MDG 
report, the region has high rates of achievement for the first 
target and moderate ones for the second. This suggests that  
the sanitation target will not be met if prevailing trends persist  
(UN 2010b). Furthermore, there are enormous differences 
within segments of the population, between urban and rural 
areas, and between the three sub-regions (Figures 12.3 
and 12.4). 

The drinking water and sanitation policy cluster includes: 
•	 freshwater	augmentation;	

These policies are specific to each sub-region on issues such 
as water use relative to water availability; existing water supply 
infrastructure including its condition and size, geographical 
watershed extent, number of people connected and number 
of people who receive measured water; user characteristics 
including socio-economic issues, consumption patterns,  
and essential and non-essential uses; and technical, financial 
and institutional resources (Sutherland and Fenn 2000). 
Examples of technological options to expand water availability 
are rainwater harvesting, water reuse, groundwater recharge  
and desalination.

These policies require a high level of commitment from 
governments as well as relatively high financial investments 
(Trémolet et al. 2010). In addition, maintenance costs, lack 
of technical competency – for example for desalination – and 
inefficient water-use habits could hinder the expansion of 
coverage. International cooperation is needed to finance cases 
requiring special technical or social development skills that 
governments cannot afford (Melo 2005). 

Investing in sanitation is cost effective in terms of the ratio 
of public cost to estimated health benefits. According to 
Trémolet et al. (2010), the economic benefits range from US$3 
to US$34 for each US$1 invested, depending on the region. 
Household treatment, such as disinfecting water for drinking 
and food preparation, cuts the primary transmission route for 
diarrhoeal disease and can pay back up to US$60 for every 
US$1 invested (WHO and UNICEF 2005). One such example is 
Brazil, with its innovative mechanisms to promote sewerage 
systems (Table 12.2f). 

Integrated coastal zone management
Population density in the region’s coastal zones is significantly 
greater than in inland areas (Figure 12.5). Coastal infrastructure, 
urbanization and tourism and land-based pollution are 
significant pressures on coastal and marine ecosystems. The rise 
in sea level due to climate change and the increasing frequency 
of El Niño/La Niña phenomena are also affecting coasts and 
changing coastline dynamics, ecosystem health, rainfall patterns 
and river flows, as well as damaging infrastructure. 

Integrated coastal zone management is a multidisciplinary and 
intersectoral approach to land-use planning that promotes 
effective, meaningful and sustainable management of coastal 
resources (Ramcharan 2001). Similar to integrated water 
management, it assimilates the interests and needs of different 
stakeholders, maintaining ecosystems and their services in a 
cooperative and rational manner. In the Caribbean, for example, 
mechanisms have been implemented through the international 
project for Integrating Watershed and Coastal Area Management 
in the Small Island Developing States of the Caribbean (IWCAM) 
and the action plans of Barbados, Belize and Saint Lucia.

The coastal management policy cluster includes the 
establishment and execution of legislation, regulations, 
standards and procedures to prevent or minimize environmental 
degradation, and to protect and restore the quality and function 
of ecological systems within the coastal zone. It requires an 
appropriate legal framework, effective institutional structure, 
and information, data and knowledge for management (Islam 
and Koudstaal 2003). It also needs a clear and collectively 

recognized definition of the coastal zone’s limits. The foundation 
for implementing this approach is a coastal zone management 
action plan, while strengthening monitoring and evaluation 
capabilities enables progress to be rigorously tracked.

Integrated coastal management promotes the preservation of 
ecologically sensitive areas such as mangroves, fosters the 
sustainability of important socio-economic activities such as

fisheries and tourism, preserves natural ecosystem functions 
and services such as coral reefs, and improves the quality of the 
marine environment, for example by reducing contamination 
from vessels and in ports. Experience in Barbados, Colombia, 
Saint Lucia and the wider Caribbean demonstrates these 
benefits (Table 12.2g, h, i). 

Biodiversity
Latin America and the Caribbean is home to approximately 70 
per cent of the world’s species and almost 20 per cent of its 
ecoregions (UNEP 2010b). Its economy is highly dependent 
on this rich biodiversity, yet it is increasingly under threat from 
human activities (Box 12.3). Although there are numerous 
biodiversity policies and measures in the region, collectively they 
do not effectively conserve its biological resources. 

Addressing the driving forces that affect biodiversity (Box 12.3) 
requires equitable, evidence-based, participatory, cross-
sectoral policies designed to protect and restore biological 
resources (Diaz 2010). In the context of the new Aichi Targets 
(CBD 2010) – 20 targets that form the framework for biodiversity 
conservation until 2020 (Box 5.1) under the Convention on 
Biological Diversity (CBD) – and given the region’s biodiversity 
priorities, CBD Article 10 was selected as the internationally 
agreed biodiversity goal related to this priority issue (CBD 
1992). The following four policy options are considered able to 
help accelerate the region’s progress towards meeting this goal.

Increasing and expanding protected areas, improving their 
management and creating greater connectivity 
Latin America and the Caribbean’s protected areas, including 
marine, cover more than 500 million hectares in 4 400 different 
zones. They are considered to be one of the region’s most 
important policy measures for conserving biological diversity 
(Bovarnick et al. 2010; UNEP 2010b). There is documented 
evidence that protected areas not only play a role in conserving 
species and habitats, but also deliver a range of ecosystem 
services and are considered important in climate change 
adaptation and mitigation (CBD 2008). If properly managed, they 
can both contribute to national gross domestic product (GDP) 
and help to cover their own costs (Table 12.3a, b). Although not 
often realized, protected areas have the potential to provide a 
range of social benefits: improving equity and alleviating poverty 
as well as empowering women, communities and indigenous 
peoples – all of which are important considerations in the region 
(Bovarnick et al. 2010). 

Although protected areas have demonstrated both progress and 
success in biodiversity conservation in Latin America and the 
Caribbean, they face a number of challenges. An important one is 
that isolated areas often offer insufficient protection, but creating 
biological corridors or improving landscape-scale connectivity 
can improve protected area performance (Brudvig et al. 2009; 
Dudley and Rao 2008; Bennett 2003). Greater connectivity can 
also improve species resilience to climate change and provide 
multiple benefits to humans (Table 12.3c, d) (Harvey et al. 2008; 
Bennett and Mulongoy 2006).

Box 12.3 Threats to biodiversity in Latin America 
and the Caribbean

Biodiversity in Latin America and the Caribbean is 
threatened by a number of linked factors including: 
•	 habitat	loss,	conversion	and	alteration;	
•	 overharvesting	or	unsustainable	use	of	terrestrial	and	

aquatic resources; 

•	 unsustainable	land	management	practices;
•	 contamination	of	terrestrial	and	aquatic	ecosystems	from	

intensive economic activities;

•	 the	spread	of	alien	invasive	species	that	impact	the	

structure and functioning of ecosystems;

•	 climate	change;	
•	 demographic	pressures;	
•	 globalization	of	markets;	and	
•	 weak	and	poorly	implemented	policies	and	failure	to 

enforce laws. 

Of all drivers, the conversion of natural environments to 
productive systems is currently considered the most pressing 
(Bovarnick et al. 2010; UNEP 2010b).

Mexico’s federal protected areas contribute at least US$3.5 billion every year to the economy. This represents a 
return of US$57 for each US$1 invested in protected areas by the federal budget (Bezaury Creel 2009; Bezaury Creel 
and Pabón Zamora 2009).
The establishment of marine protected areas is a common way for governments to regulate activities affecting coral 
and marine resources. In the Montego Bay Marine Park, a tax of 0.1% on tourist equipment helps to cover the park’s 
costs and sustain the park’s activities (Reid-Grant and Bhat 2009).
Established in 1997 by the governments of the eight Central American countries, the Mesoamerican Biological 
Corridor acts as a primary pathway between large and important areas of habitat, predominantly protected areas. 
By promoting greater opportunities for local residents to participate in planning and management, the corridor is 
helping to promote a greater sense of human well-being while ensuring that the biological heritage of the region is 
protected and enhanced (López and Jiménez 2007; Bennett 2004).
A voluntary agreement created the corridor to encourage regional management for the Eastern Tropical Pacific 
seascape. The initiative has included more than 80 non-governmental organizations, research organizations, 
local community groups and the private sector in promoting regional cooperation for training, education and the 
conservation of coastal-marine resources (UNESCO 2011).
Brazil’s Amazon Region Protected Areas (ARPA) programme is the largest worldwide initiative in tropical forest 
conservation, aiming to protect 600 000 km² of biologically important areas between 2003 and 2018. ARPA has been 
innovative in 

•	 developing	decision	support	tools	in	protected	area	management;	
•	 developing	financial	mechanisms	to	allow	protected	areas	to	be	sustainable	in	the	long	term;	and	
•	 engaging	a	wide	range	of	stakeholders	in	the	decision-making	process.	

ARPA has the potential to avoid 5 billion tonnes of carbon emissions by 2050 (Simpson 2010; Azevedo-Ramos et al. 2006).

The 240 000-km2 Dry Chiquitano Forest ecoregion has adopted an ecosystem-based framework and has highlighted 
the importance of certain key factors in ecosystem management, including participation of local communities, 
decentralization of decision making, setting priorities based on ecological integrity, and planning at multiple 
temporal and spatial scales (Vides-Almonacid et al. 2008).
The ecosystem approach has been applied to the management of water resources in the La Plata river basin. This 
region is considered important for protection because of poverty, the presence of indigenous communities, and likely 
effects of climate change in the area. Management approaches include integrated water resources management as a 
key component (Bello et al. 2009; Forero 2008). 
The ecosystem approach is being applied to improve the management of multiple-use marine and coastal protected 
areas in Chile. Key factors that have been given attention are research, incorporation of local communities in 
management of the ecosystem, and incorporation of the areas into national land-use plans (De Andrade 2008).

To protect the water resources that originate in micro-watersheds in the hills above Heredia, the water authority 
established a scheme to pay landowners in the upper watershed to reforest the land (US$1 000 per hectare per year 
under a five-year contract), and to prevent cattle ranching close to the streams (US$100 per hectare per year for ten 
years). A hydrological tariff, derived from fees charged to water authority customers, supports the scheme. Customers 
pay approximately US$0.05 per m3 for the ecosystem services delivered by landowners (Jindal and Kerr 2007).
The Green Fund of Trinidad and Tobago was established by the government under the Finance Act 2004, Part XIV – 
Green Fund Levy – and is capitalized by a turnover tax on corporations operating in the country. The purpose of the 
fund is to ensure that there is a sustainable source of financing available to support targeted efforts to conserve 
biodiversity and promote ecosystem management in Trinidad and Tobago (UNEP 2011b). 

Under the Peruvian Law for the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Biodiversity (Law 26839), the state and the 
native and peasant communities participate in the protection and promotion of plant genetic resources, and the 
knowledge, innovations and practices associated with those resources (UNEP 2003).
The Central American Commission on Environment and Development has adopted a Central American Protocol on 
Access to Genetic and Biochemical Resources and to the Associated Traditional Knowledge (UNEP 2003).

Other ways to enhance protected area effectiveness in the 
region include:
•	 advancing	conservation	in	marine	and	freshwater	protected	

areas that are still largely under-represented; 

•	 effectively	integrating	indigenous	and	local	communities	
in protected area management, including, where relevant, 

by promoting indigenous- and community-conserved areas 
(Chapter 5);

•	 promoting	the	links	between	conservation	and	development	

goals, using land-use planning as a fundamental tool; 

•	 improving	research	capability	and	strengthening	links	between	
research and decision-making frameworks (Table 12.3e); and

(Elbers 2011; Mora and Sale 2011; BirdLife International 
2009; Cuartas 2008; Guarderas et al. 2008; McElhinny 2007; 
Bennett and Mulongoy 2006; Oviedo 2006; Rivera et al. 2006; 
Burke and Maidens 2004; Geoghegan and Renard 2002).

In addition, key instruments for protected area management 
include ecotourism and sustainable tourism programmes; 
balancing the relationship between conservation and 
development through mechanisms such as payment for 
ecosystem services, including for carbon dioxide (CO2) capture 
and sequestration services and environmental stewardship 
and usage fees (see below); and the selective extraction of 
resources (UNEP 2010b; Eguren 2004). Measures such as tax 
incentives, preservation easements, education, decentralized 
administration, partnerships with international organizations 
and outright land purchases may also encourage and promote 
protected areas and associated corridors and linked landscapes.

Applying the ecosystem approach to biodiversity management 
The ecosystem, or ecosystem-based, approach is increasingly 
recognized as an important strategy in biodiversity management, 
especially in the context of climate change (World Bank 2010).  
According to the CBD, it is “a strategy for the integrated 
management of land, water and living resources that promotes 
conservation and sustainable use in an equitable way” (Box 12.4).

The ecosystem approach is not designed to replace other 
management and conservation approaches, but rather to 
complement and support them, for example sustainable forest 
management, integrated river basin management, integrated 
marine and coastal area management and sustainable fisheries 
(Table 12.3f, g, h). In addition, approaches such as creating 
protected areas, corridors or biosphere reserves and species 
conservation programmes, as well as action under existing 
national policy and legislative frameworks, can be integrated to 
deal with complex ecological situations (Bianchi and Skjoldal 
2008; Waltner-Toews et al. 2008; CBD 2004).

The ecosystem approach has been identified as a key policy 
in Latin America and the Caribbean for two main reasons: it is 
useful for managing water resources, wetlands and land, and in 
developing payment for ecosystem services; and many pristine 
ecosystems still exist with high conservation value (Andrade 
Perez 2008). Because of their size, the Caribbean’s small island 
states also present excellent opportunities for implementing 
the ecosystem approach, and could serve as case studies for 
ascertaining its strengths and weaknesses.

Although there are several on-the-ground initiatives applying 
an ecosystem approach in the region, this has often been done 
on an ad hoc, single-project basis, which remains a challenge. 
Such initiatives need to be better integrated into institutions, 
including those concerned with sectors outside biodiversity 
conservation, such as agriculture, fisheries, forestry and health. 
More research is also needed (De Freitas et al. 2007) to support 
the development of a monitoring and evaluation framework for

local crop varieties that are better adapted to the low-input conditions 
of organic farming. © Maria Pavlova/iStock

each of the principles of the ecosystem approach (CBD 2004). In 
addition, issues such as illiteracy, land boundaries and the cost 
of participatory processes all need to be considered in integrating 
and assessing the impact of the approach in Latin America and 
the Caribbean (Andrade Perez 2008). 

Box 12.4 Key features of the ecosystem approach 
to biodiversity management

The ecosystem approach goes beyond conservation and 
promotes the sustainable use of resources with a focus on 
equity, participation and decentralization. It can be applied 
in a flexible manner depending on the social, economic, 
environmental and cultural context. Its key features include: 
•	 emphasizing	adaptive	management;	
•	 fostering	integration	by	accounting	for	all	usable	goods	
and services and optimizing the mixing of their benefits; 
•	 involving	other	forms	of	knowledge,	including	indigenous	

and local;

•	 focusing	on	people,	their	society	and	their	culture;	
•	 orientation	to	environmental	and	societal	conservation;	
•	 applying	a	two-way	approach	–	top-down	and	bottom-up;	
•	 a	long-term	vision;	and	
•	considering	goods	and	services	as	the	product	of	a	healthy	

ecosystem and not as ends in themselves.

Monetary compensation provides a tangible incentive to 
protect habitats and their biodiversity by providing sustainable 
livelihoods (Table 12.3i); it also mitigates the initial needs that 
drive unsustainable biodiversity resource use (Ferraro 2001). 
As such, PES has the potential to increase employment and 
equity (Montagnini and Finney 2011; Bovarnick et al. 2010). 
This reduces poverty, since low-income groups and ecologically 
sensitive land in the region’s developing countries often 
co-exist (Milder et al. 2010). Given that there is a strong link 
between habitat protection, rehabilitation and a number of 
ecosystem services – such as water provision and purification, 
coastal protection, mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions and 
protection against soil erosion – PES schemes bring multiple co-
benefits to a range of sectors (WRI 2009).
 
Payment for ecosystem services is not without challenges. Its 
limited application (Redford and Adams 2009) and a lack of 
information on economic valuation highlight the need to invest 
more in research and furthering the scientific understanding 
of local environmental conditions. Certain services cannot 
be measured, however, and determining the seller of these 
services is also difficult (Farley and Costanza 2010). Moreover, 
finding buyers and mobilizing funding is the greatest challenge 
to implementing PES. Coupling PES with innovative financing 
mechanisms, however, could address this. Examples include 
ring-fencing budget allocations for environmental protection, as 
in the Programme for Forest incentives in Guatemala; earmarking 
government taxes for environmental protection, such as Brazil’s 
ecological value added tax; providing environmental funds like 
Trinidad and Tobago’s Green Fund (Table 12.3j); and setting up 
public-private partnerships (FAO 2011; Dijk and Savenije 2009). 

Access and benefit sharing
Latin America and the Caribbean’s rich genetic resources are 
important to local communities in sustaining their livelihoods, 
and especially in providing food security. However, many genetic 
resources are also the basis of commercial use and production. To 
promote equity and safeguard the genetic diversity and associated 
traditional/local knowledge within the region’s countries, there has 
been a growing interest in access and benefit sharing (Chapter 5).

Argentina, Brazil, Costa Rica, Mexico and Peru have developed 
access and benefit-sharing legislation at the national level (Table 
12.3k) and the Andean Community states and Central American 
Commission on Environment and Development have done so at 
the sub-regional level (Table 12.3l). At the national level, there 
are two main groups of associated legislation (Glowka 1998): 
framework laws on sustainable development, nature conservation 
and biodiversity (Costa Rica, Mexico, Peru); and dedicated or 
stand-alone national laws or decrees (Brazil). Access and benefit-
sharing considerations can also be incorporated into general 
environmental framework laws, or existing laws and regulations 
can be modified to address them, although this has not yet 
occurred in Latin America and the Caribbean (UNEP 2003).

Enhancing biodiversity conservation through payment for 
ecosystem services
A number of options grounded in economic theory present 
promising opportunities for both mainstreaming biodiversity 
issues and reducing driving forces, while simultaneously 
supporting development processes and promoting human 
well-being. Among these is the payment for ecosystem services 
– or PES – mechanism, which was largely pioneered in Latin 
America and the Caribbean (Wunder 2007), and which is gaining 
popularity worldwide as an effective approach to dealing with 
biodiversity loss (UNEP 2010b; Pfaff et al. 2008).

In general terms, PES schemes or systems offer incentives, 
usually monetary ones, to individuals to protect and ensure the 
delivery of key ecosystem services at local, national and regional 
levels. The mechanism can address many of the driving forces 
of biodiversity loss in the region, especially habitat loss and 
unsustainable land management, as it usually aims to protect 
and/or rehabilitate natural vegetation. In addition it can support 
many existing policies (Box 12.5).

Box 12.5 Payment for ecosystem services (PES) in 
support of existing policies

PES can be used in conjunction with other Latin American  
and Caribbean policies, for example:
•	 protected	areas;
•	 integrated	water	management;
•	 conservation	and	restoration	of	water-supplying	

ecosystems;

•	 sustainable	forest	management;
•	 small-scale	agro-ecological	systems;	and
•	 recovery	of	degraded	lands.

Part 2: Policy Options

Utilization, adopted in October 2010, now provides a global 
framework for improving legal certainty and transparency related 
to access and benefit sharing (CBD 2011), and could help Latin 
American and Caribbean countries overcome various problems 
in implementing relevant policy. As of April 2012, 14 countries 
in the region are signatories to the protocol (CBD 2011). To 
maximize the advantages of access and benefit-sharing policies, 
attention needs to be paid to several factors, including: 
•	 undertaking	research	to	better	understand	and	apply	access	
and benefit-sharing principles and the Nagoya Protocol in the 
regional context; 

•	 enhancing	human,	technical	and	financial	capacities;	
•	 clarifying	legal	definitions	and	interpretations;	
•	 understanding	and	dealing	with	the	transboundary	nature	of	

genetic resources; 

•	 protecting	traditional	knowledge;	and	
•	 negotiating	tangible	benefits	instead	of	focusing	only	on	

access procedures (UNEP 2010a; CBD 2008).

Land use, land degradation and desertification
Pressure on land resources has increased in recent years 
despite international goals to improve land management (Box 
12.6; Chapter 3). To halt and reverse land degradation and 
ensure renewable resources are used sustainably, policies 
allowing productive activities with minimal impact on natural 
ecosystems and their environmental services are required. 
These include land-use policies that prevent inefficient or 
inappropriate transformation for agriculture, livestock or illegal 
crops (Grau and Aide 2008). Examples include sustainable forest 
management, increasing efficiency and intensifying productivity 
to reduce environmental impacts, improving waste management, 
decreasing the amount of new land being cultivated, and 
helping prevent conflicts due to land, water and other resource 
shortages. At the same time, environmentally friendly productive 
activities with tangible economic benefits for land owners and 
environmental services for society need promotion. Finally, 
degraded ecosystems need to be rehabilitated and their 
sustainability ensured to restore the productivity chain that 
supports ecological balance and social and economic well-being. 

Based on a review of current and past experiences in Latin 
America and the Caribbean, the three land-management policies 
described in this section are considered the most favourable to 
attain the goals set out in Paragraph 40b of the Johannesburg 
Plan of Implementation (WSSD 2002). These are multi-scale land-
use planning, sustainable agriculture and livestock production, 
and the recovery of degraded lands. The climate change and 
biodiversity sections deal with payment for ecosystem services 
and sustainable forest management, while the water section 
discusses policies related to integrated land management and 
water-use plans. 

Multi-scale land-use planning 
Land-use plans take account of all the resources and dimensions 
involved in the development process and help implement 
integrated land-use management, water resource planning and 
conservation priorities, while also encouraging inclusive, multi-

stakeholder participation. Land-use planning considers a number 
of inseparable elements: land, renewable and non-renewable 
resources, and a coherent view of current and historic lands and 
their uses, existing services, accessibility and cultural influences. 
Land uses such as agriculture, agroforestry, livestock production, 
industrial development and mining, among others, must also be 
considered (Cardenas-Moller and Bianco 2011; ECLAC 2010a; 
Weber 2009).

land-related conflicts, including transboundary controversies 
over scarce resources between and within sectors and countries; 
land tenure and titling issues for rural families – where creating 
cadastral and registration agencies helps create stability; and 
the rights of minority groups such as indigenous communities 
and women to land ownership. Furthermore, land-use planning 
can be an effective mechanism to prevent resource depletion and 
environmental degradation (Table 12.4a, b, c).

In a wider sense, land-use planning should also include marine 
and coastal zones because of the interaction between land and 
aquatic environments (Table 12.4d). According to UNEP-CEP 
(2011b), land-based activities are the greatest threat to 
Caribbean coastal and marine habitats. Likewise, the integrity of 
marine and coastal ecosystems, which is linked to terrestrial well-

being, also affects social resilience, especially in terms of public 
health and livelihoods. 

Several countries have either implemented or are preparing land 
administration plans, including national coastal management 
acts (Loper et al. 2005; Cabeza 2002). Land administration 
projects in Latin America are focused primarily on facilitating 
a land market. Although projects have social equity and 
environmental sustainability goals (Deininger and Bingswanger 
1999), these are largely of secondary importance (IDB 2002). In 
some countries, for example Bolivia, Ecuador and Peru, advances 
in land administration require improvement in the property 
market infrastructure (World Bank 2001). Land tenure also needs 
to be stabilized, especially in post-conflict situations such as

Economic and ecological zoning in the San Martin region contributed to the development of the conceptual and 
methodological basis for the National Framework for Land Use Planning. Zoning promotes the inclusion of disaster 
risk management and climate change adaptation in the participatory process of its design and implementation 
(Castillo 2011).
In 2008, the State Council approved a mining policy that established principles designed to promote the 
sustainable development of mining in Cuba by creating quality control systems and environmental protection 
measures, regulating mine closures and determining the recovery of environmental liabilities, among others (ECLAC 
2010a).
Indigenous land management of traditional communal lands of the Bolivian Amazon has been developed to 
improve the well-being of people living in rural and indigenous communities, and to help protect forest services 
(Sabogal et al. 2008). Other initiatives involve community forest management plans in Oaxaca, Puebla and 
Quintana Roo, Mexico; in the Maya Biosphere Reserve in El Petén, Guatemala; and in Amazonian communities in 
Brazil and Peru (UNEP 2010b).
The definition of activities and land uses for this policy were based on three criteria: land suitability; the interests 
of different stakeholders including tourism, fisheries, agriculture, maritime security and conservation; and other 
significant issues identified on the basis of their recurrence, intensity or extent. An integrated assessment was 
prepared that included the most significant interactions between terrestrial and marine ecosystems (SEMARNAT 2011).

AgroSandals, Jamaica, the Nevis Model of Hotel/Farmer Partnership, and the Tri-Lakes Project in Guyana aim for 
sustainable agriculture while linking agriculture with tourism and culture, in association with the private sector, 
community members and government agencies. Programmes have reported good returns: in Jamaica, for example, 
farmers’ sales income increased more than 55 times in the first three years of the initiative, from US$60 000 to 
US$3.3 million (Harvey 2011).
While ensuring national food security under a trade embargo, Cuba’s transition to organic agriculture has also 
had a positive impact on people’s livelihoods by guaranteeing a steady income for a significant proportion of the 
population. Moreover, the lack of synthetic pesticides in agricultural production is likely to have a positive long-
term impact on people’s well-being, since such chemicals are often associated with negative health implications 
including some forms of cancer (UNEP 2011d).
The Regional Integrated Silvo-pastoral Ecosystem Management Project is piloting the use of payment for ecosystem 
services to induce the adoption of silvo-pastoral practices in degraded pastures in Colombia, Costa Rica and 
Nicaragua. In Nicaragua, the area of degraded pasture fell by two-thirds, while pastures with high tree density 
increased substantially, as did fodder banks and hedges. The project developed an environmental services index 
and pays participants for net increases in points (Pagiola et al. 2007).
The adoption of conservation tillage and less aggressive pesticides caused, respectively, a dramatic decrease in soil 
erosion and contamination risk in Argentina throughout 1956–2005. The risk of water and wind-related erosion fell 
considerably in response to the expansion of zero-tillage agriculture in the last two decades (Viglizzo et al. 2011).
Various Brazilian organizations united to develop a project on integrated crop-livestock zero-tillage systems in 
the Brazilian Cerrado. Rotating such annual crops as maize, soya and rice with no tillage allowed intensification 
of land use, increased productivity per hectare, and reduced the need for clearing additional land for pasture or 
arable land. Estimates indicate that this resulted in a reduction in clearance of 0.25–2.5 hectares for every hectare 
involved in the project. Reported effects of integrating crops and livestock with zero tillage showed less use of 
leaching herbicides, lower fertilizer use and lower greenhouse gas emissions (Landers 2007).

Part 2: Policy Options

There are several challenges associated with land-use planning, 
including the lengthy process of collecting land-use and 
cadastral data, which requires information about legal titling 
that is hampered by legal barriers. The often illegal nature of 
historic land tenure processes, including forced displacement of 
peasants resulting from civil conflict or corrupt but sophisticated 
schemes, is another constraint (IDMC 2010; Springer 2006). 
In addition, transaction costs may be a major obstacle to 
registration, particularly for the poor (Barnes 2003). Finally, 
land-use planning policies may discriminate against minority 
groups such as indigenous and peasant communities, since 
many land administration projects are based on a simple 
territorial demarcation and a title issued in the name of the group 
(Ankersen and Barnes 2003).

The ceding of subsoil rights in indigenous territories to such 
outside economic interests as oil and mining companies 
can result in major physical intrusions and habitat damage, 
generated, for example, by the construction of infrastructure 
and roads. The Xingú River basin in Brazil is an example of the 
successful protection of indigenous territory from deforestation 
through land policies that include community participation (UNEP 
2010b; UNEP et al. 2009; Sabogal et al. 2008). 

Regional experiences show that it is much more important to 
obtain general agreements on land policy direction than to 
require, a priori, a technically perfect legal framework. New legal 
frameworks have proven ineffective, as insufficient attention has 
been paid to stakeholder discussions or the dissemination of 
their rights (Barnes 2003). 

Sustainable agriculture and livestock production
In land-use policy making, it is necessary to distinguish between 
small-scale and large-scale commercial agriculture. Out migration 
and land sparing, a system under which some land is farmed 
intensively to maximize yields while other land is protected as 
a nature reserve, allow more land to be devoted to preserving 
biodiversity and providing ecosystem services (Green et al. 
2005), but small-scale agro-ecological systems appear to be a 
good option for combining hunger alleviation and biodiversity 
preservation. Perfecto and Vandermeer (2010) suggest using a 
policy-making matrix that integrates agricultural and conservation 
elements to boost small-scale agro-ecological options. Policy-
making matrices that use a framework built around payment for 
ecosystem services can significantly strengthen this approach.

Policies that promote organic agriculture, silvo-pastoral 
practices, ecotourism and sustainable rural tourism, fall within 
this category. Silvo-pastoral strategies such as planting trees 
and shrubs in pastures, fodder banks or trees and shrubs 
as hedges, induce farmers to increase practices that provide 
ecosystem services – improving biodiversity, sequestering 
carbon and conserving water resources (Pagiola et al. 2007). 
Policies fostering ecotourism including sustainable rural tourism 
promote the optimal use of natural resources and respect for 
socio-cultural diversity, which improves economic viability and 
distributes benefits more equitably. Well planned rural tourism

silvo-pastoral systems for their livelihoods. © Bob BalestriiStock

can promote social development and equity, providing more 
opportunities for vulnerable groups such as youth, women and 
indigenous communities (COPLA 2009).

Examples of successful land-use planning are agritourism 
initiatives in the Caribbean (Table 12.4e) (Harvey 2011); Cuba’s 
transition to organic agriculture (Table 12.4f) (UNEP 2011a); 
silvo-pastoral practices and PES in Colombia, Costa Rica and 
Nicaragua (Table 12.4g) (Pagiola et al. 2007); and rural-based 
community tourism in Guatemala and Nicaragua (COPLA 2009). 

Land-use policies for large-scale commercial agriculture, which 
occurs in Argentina and Brazil, should promote sustainability 
through integrating existing knowledge with input-based farming 
technology. Policy options include the adoption of agronomic 
practices such as zero-tillage (Viglizzo et al. 2011), minimum 
tillage, crop diversification, crop rotation and integrated pest 
management, combined with strategic applications of fertilizers 
and irrigation water, using low-impact pesticides and the 
expansion of precision farming procedures (Table 12.4h, i). 
These practices have had positive impacts in Argentina, where 
public-private partnerships have been successful (Viglizzo et al. 
2011); in Paraguay’s poultry industry where initiatives for cleaner 
production have been effective; and in Uruguay’s environmentally 
friendly rice cultivation (UNEP and MercoNet 2011). 

Empirical evidence in Latin America and the Caribbean suggests 
two ways of developing environmentally friendly livestock 
production systems, regardless of the farming scale: first, by 
increasing beef productivity through the dilution of maintenance 
costs; and second, by integrating crops, pastures, fodder and 
livestock production. The first case results in a significant reduction 
in land, water, fossil fuels, feed consumption and outputs of 
manure and greenhouse gases. In the second case, experience 
with integrated crop rotation, livestock production and zero-tillage 
operations in the Brazilian Cerrado allowed grain and meat to be 
produced sustainably on the same lands, thus eliminating the 
need to deforest more land (Landers 2007) (Table 12.4i).

Latin America and the Caribbean 335

Restoration of degraded lands 
In addition to impacts on biodiversity and the economy, land 
degradation has social consequences. These include increased 
vulnerability to floods and dust storms; health risks such as 
from vector-borne diseases associated with deforestation (Patz 
and Norris 2004), and illnesses from contaminated sites; loss 
of environmental services including water source recharge; and 
decreased carbon sequestration and evapotranspiration. Thus, 
the region should prioritize the restoration of degraded lands 
(Box 12.7), which complements conservation and ecosystem 
management policies oriented to climate change mitigation 
and adaptation, reduces disaster risk, and helps maintain the 
hydrologic cycle and water sources.

All available land, particularly degraded or marginal areas, 
needs to be used efficiently to satisfy the socio-economic and 
environmental needs of current and future populations as well 
as to conserve natural ecosystems. Given the environmental, 
social and economic benefits of land, it is important to institute 
restoration or rehabilitation policies. Land can simultaneously 
generate profits through agriculture, livestock husbandry (Aguiar 
and Roman 2007) or forestry, and maintain and purify water 
sources, reduce the risk of floods and mudslides and improve 
people’s living conditions (Rees et al. 2007). Given the high 
costs associated with restoration projects, better economic 
instruments are needed, including government commitments 
that promote and finance these projects.

Restoring land and environmental services provides new 
options for productive activities, reduces the vulnerability of 
populations and decreases the conversion of natural ecosystems 
to agriculture or pasture. Other commercial activities, such as 
ecotourism, can also be encouraged. In addition to reclaiming 
soil and accelerating forest regeneration, for example, the 
biological corridor project of Nogal-La Selva in Costa Rica 
(Montagnini 2001) represented an economic incentive for 
local farmers, while the reforestation project in the Panama 
Canal watershed reduced the costs of maintaining the canal’s 
infrastructure (ACP 2007; BCEOM-TERRAM 2006). Restoring 
degraded lands benefits both market-based and non-market-
based ecosystem services at multiple spatial scales. 

Land restoration policies and action account for the specific 
conditions of the site and the benefits expected. Effective 
restoration requires setting specific and clear goals as part of the 
planning process and ensuring that the parties compromised by 
the recovery of degraded lands accept them. Thus, implementing 
the policies requires effective participatory mechanisms that 
include indigenous and other disadvantaged groups. For this 
reason, certainty and legitimacy of land tenure are also required.

Climate change 
Climate change is exacerbating many of Latin America and 
the Caribbean’s environmental challenges; it also threatens 
development gains, poverty reduction and economic growth. 
Although the region accounts for a relatively modest 12 per 
cent of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions, it is already

burgeoning movement to develop sustainable agricultural value chains 
that improve farmers’ profits. © Joel Carillet/iStock

There are examples of successful organic agriculture in most 
Latin American and Caribbean countries (Table 12.4f), although 
there is a need to harmonize policies, particularly those 
related to market access and distribution. Many countries are 
establishing regulations and standards for organic production 
while a few are providing limited financial support to pay 
certification costs during the conversion period (Willer and 
Kilcher 2011). The current global market for organic production 
has encouraged the development of standards, certification 
processes and public-private partnerships to facilitate market 
access to organic produce. 

Access to micro and small-scale credit in poor rural communities 
is necessary to ensure that land use is managed sustainably. 
The enabling conditions that facilitate the expansion of 
sustainable models of large-scale commercial farming generally 
rely on access to modern technology, for example precision 
and low-impact farming and information and communication 
technologies; updated agronomic knowledge; the professional 
capacity of farmers; good international prices; the financial 
capacity of individual farmers and investment funds; and credits 
to farmers’ cooperatives.

Part 2: Policy Options

experiencing the adverse consequences of climate change and 
variability (De la Torre et al. 2009). As vulnerability to climate 
impacts increases, addressing the underlying drivers of risk 
becomes a top priority. Poverty, marginalization, exclusion 
from decision-making processes, lack of opportunities, limited 
access to credit, inadequate education, poor basic infrastructure, 
inequity, insecure land tenure, and other factors external and 
internal to the region, continue to exacerbate its vulnerability. 

To address climate change, the region needs to commit to 
the sustained implementation of international and regional 
agendas, such as the United Nations Framework Convention on 
Climate Change and its Kyoto Protocol (UNFCCC 1998, 1992), 
and the Hyogo Framework for Action (ISDR 2005). It should also 
commit to the sustainable environmental management of forests 
and key ecosystems; energy efficiency and the development 
of new, renewable energy sources; ecoagriculture; and the 
transformation of transport systems, implemented in a socially 
and environmentally responsible way by respecting people’s and 
communities’ rights, and supported by international financial 
and economic mechanisms (IISD 2010). 

With the world’s highest percentage of urban dwellers, the 
Latin America and Caribbean region faces many climate change 
challenges in its large and growing cities, many of which are 
located in higher-risk areas on low-lying coastal plains (World Bank 
2011b). To build resilience among the segments of the population 
most in need, municipal policies should be city-specific and work 
in tandem with national and international efforts for mitigation and 
adaptation (World Bank 2011b). Although the region’s cities have 
taken many initiatives on policies and activities both to mitigate 
and adapt to climate change, these have focused mostly on the 
former. It has been difficult to promote adaptation at the local level 
without the necessary support from higher levels of government 
and the international community. This has left a gap in the support 
and funding of locally determined, locally driven adaptation efforts 
that serve and work with those most at risk. The best opportunities 
to adapt to climate change are linked with action to address the 
underlying causes of vulnerability and respond to more than one 
problem at a time (Hardoy and Lankao 2011).

The policy clusters described in this section advance progress 
towards the internationally agreed UNFCCC goal (UNFCCC 1992 
Article 3 Paragraph 1–3), selected to address climate change. 
It emphasizes precautionary measures to anticipate, prevent 
or minimize the causes of climate change and mitigate its 
adverse effects.

Reducing the vulnerability of populations through efficient 
adaptation
Implementing adaptation measures that consider economic, 
social-ecological and political criteria is an immense challenge. 
Fostering research programmes on the impacts of climate change, 
deforestation and land-use change on the natural environment 
and the social fabric are priorities, as are strengthening 
evidence-based policy making and the appropriate institutional 
infrastructure (De la Torre et al. 2009). 

Box 12.8 Mainstreaming adaptation to climate 
change in the Caribbean

Mainstreaming adaptation into policy development has 
proved to be effective in approaching the common goal of 
increasing resilience. In the Caribbean, for more than 15 
years, the Global Environment Facility (GEF), World Bank, 
CARICOM and other partners have supported a series 
of policy-oriented adaptation programmes, namely the 
Caribbean Planning for Adaptation to Climate Change and 
Mainstreaming Adaptation into Climate Change, both of 
which have been completed. Currently ongoing are the 
Special Programme for Adaptation to Climate Change: 
Implementation of Adaptation Measures in Coastal Zones, 
and Enhancing Capacity for Adaptation to Climate Change. 
From this long-term effort, numerous reports from the wider 
Caribbean have been produced, including sector-specific 
policy recommendations for water resources, agriculture, 
forestry, food security, tourism, fisheries and coastal zone 
management, information and communication, and social 
services such as health and education (CCCCC 2011).

Policies for adapting to climate change are critical for 
strengthening natural capital management. This is especially 
the case for managing changing water flows and improving 
ecosystem resilience, strengthening direct protection against 
climate-related threats in cases for which collective action is 
needed, and strengthening technology transfer and knowledge 
flows (De la Torre et al. 2009). 

The following presents a more detailed analysis of the many 
issues related to adaptation policy development in Latin America 
and the Caribbean, structured as four policy groupings.
 
Strengthening ecosystem management for improving resilience: 
some countries have made significant efforts to provide a 
more solid methodological and analytical evidence base for 
understanding the relationship between ecosystem health, 
resilience and vulnerability. They have also developed economic 
cost-benefit analyses of ecosystem policy options and their 
potential in reducing the vulnerability of societies. Innovative 
policies and financial mechanisms for delivery are also required, 
as are sustainably resourced and multi-stakeholder capacity 
building and active participation of local stakeholders in 
implementing the process. Land-use planning and protected 
areas are local mechanisms for managing ecosystem services 
that include the concept of risk reduction (ISDR 2009).

The examples in Table 12.5 provide a combination of economic, 
environmental and social policy options for climate change 
adaptation based on improved ecosystem management. 
Earlier sections on policies for sustaining water provision and 
consumption, and on payment for ecosystem services are further 
examples of these policy instruments.

The promotion of community-based conservation of the Maya nut tree focuses on rural indigenous women 
and children, and on increasing agro-ecosystem resilience through the support of different sectors (Buffle and 
Vohman 2011).
This programme brings together efforts on integrated environmental management; cleaner production, recycling 
and reuse; reduction of pollution; enterprise management; natural resources protection and biodiversity access 
and management; and introduction of environmental education at all levels (AMA et al. 2009).
Efforts have raised local awareness of mangrove habitat as an adaptive climate change management tool and 
widened the scope of conservation effort through different community initiatives (WWF 2011).
The Japan International Cooperation System Company has helped to plan the introduction of clean solar 
energy systems in one of 13 islands that form the Galapagos archipelago (UNDP 2010a).
This project is a participatory process for the protection, development, management and use of the resources 
of the Aripo Savannas Environmentally Sensitive Area over a 10–15 year period (CANARI 2011).

The Sustainable Social Housing Initiative has brought sustainable building practices to social housing 
programmes, including design criteria and construction practices (UNEP and UNOPS 2011). 
The Barbados waterfront promenade (boardwalk) was built as an adaptation measure to protect 1.2 km of 
coastline. The island’s coastal resources support diverse ecosystems and the critical tourism industry (Toba 2009).
The Ministry of Finance in Peru introduced disaster risk reduction in the assessment of public investments 
with a strong programme for capacity building. The initiative was replicated by the government of Costa Rica 
(ISDR 2011).

Forecasts of hydro-meteorological events, volcanoes, tsunamis and droughts have been implemented by 
Cuba, Mexico’s National Centre for Disaster Prevention (CENAPRED) and the Caribbean Disaster Emergency 
Management Agency (CDEMA), to enable populations to protect themselves from injury and disease 
(CENAPRED 2011; Rubiera 2010).
The aim of the Central American Early Warning System (SATCA) is to strengthen early warning systems across 
disaster-prone Central America, to enhance humanitarian preparedness and build risk reduction capacities 
among local and regional actors. 

The Rainforest Alliance’s Climate Module assists farmers identify the risks and impacts of climate change 
on their farms and communities, and to promote the adoption of good agricultural practices that reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions, increase carbon sequestration and enhance the capacity of farms to adapt to 
climate change (Rainforest Alliance 2011).
The Bolsa Floresta programme focuses on reducing deforestation in protected areas using four mechanisms: 
direct payment of grants to smallholder farmers in exchange for forest protection; investments in social 
improvements in communities; payments to local associations to strengthen local organization and control 
of the Bolsa Floresta programme; and payments to communities employing sustainable production methods. 
The programme addresses broad social concerns, which is likely to make the strategy more sustainable in the 
long term. The programme has reached 32 000 people (Amazonas Sustainable Foundation 2011).
The Atención a Crisis pilot project focuses on two interventions: vocational training and a productive 
investment package to improve the resilience of poor rural households to natural risks and economic 
downturns (World Bank 2011a).
The Colombian National Coffee Federation has provided local communities with basic infrastructure, 
improving living conditions on productive agricultural farms. It has also set up a research centre to generate 
appropriate, competitive and sustainable coffee production technology (Armenteras et al. 2005).
Chalalán Ecolodge is a community business focused on enjoyment of and in-depth learning about the 
rainforest under the guidance of local indigenous people. It represents a new community business model that 
integrates environmental issues into design and operation (UNDP 2010b). 
Implemented by the Andean Community of Nations, pilot projects aim to demonstrate the costs and benefits 
of adapting to rapid glacier retreat in the tropical Andes, and to generate a knowledge base that can then be 
used to design projects in other vulnerable communities faced with similar challenges.

Encourage diversification of the energy matrix through renewable energy
(q)

A tender system for alternative energy  
Brazil

Brazil has been encouraging renewable energy through energy auctions, which offer a range of sources such 
as natural gas and hydro. In 2008, it obtained positive results for biomass, and in 2009 for wind energy, when 
more than 1 800 megawatts of wind generation was traded (La Rovere et al. 2011; Szklo et al. 2005).

(r)

Energy guidelines
Uruguay

In 2006, Uruguay released its Energy Strategy Guidelines to accelerate the transition to renewable energy 
sources and reduce dependence on oil. These guidelines promote the use of alternative energy sources, 
especially biofuels, wind energy and biomass as an energy source for industry (PNUMA et al. 2008).

TransMilenio is a sustainable urban mass-transport system in the metropolitan area of Bogotá, Colombia. 
The project aims to shift the transport paradigm in urban areas from individual and private to public and 
inclusive. It replaces the conventional transport system with a bus rapid-transit system, a dedicated track 
for special buses. First Curitiba and Bogotá, then Río de Janeiro and Porto Alegre have implemented these 
systems. Six other cities in Colombia, Guayaquil and Quito in Ecuador, Mexico City, and Santiago de Chile 
have their own bus rapid-transit systems (Grütter Consulting 2006/2010; LIMA 2010; WRI 2010, 2008; Det 
Norske Veritas 2006).
The National Electrical Energy Conservation Programme (PROCEL) is a labelling and reward programme, 
created in 1985, consisting of a number of sub-programmes in industry, sanitation, education, construction, 
public buildings, municipal action, promotion of information, technological development and dissemination 
of experiences and successes (Szklo et al. 2005).
Cuba introduced the Cuban Energy Saving Programme (PAEC) in 1997. During the course of just under a 
decade, less efficient incandescent light bulbs were replaced free of charge with compact fluorescent ones 
(UNEP 2011c). In 2004, the energy efficiency programme, Energy Revolution, was introduced, under which 
household appliances throughout the country have been replaced with more efficient ones at subsidized 
prices (Revolución Cubana 2011).

Towards resilient infrastructure: in light of the risks posed 
by extreme weather events, reducing the vulnerability of 
infrastructure systems should be a central objective of climate 
change adaptation policy. The region has a wide range of 
potential policy instruments addressing these concerns, the 
most cost effective and efficient of which rely on enforcing 
sustainable building standards (Table 12.5f) and relocating 
vulnerable populations. Large-scale projects to build or replace 
infrastructure in the coming years present a tremendous 
opportunity to ensure that physical infrastructure and land-
use systems are resilient in a changing climate. The Barbados 
boardwalk is an example (Table 12.5g). 

There is also significant opportunity to improve the cost 
effectiveness and sustainability of climate-resilient infrastructure 
investments by more systematically considering ecosystem-
based approaches as a component of comprehensive

infrastructure adaptation strategies (Henstra and McBean 2009). 
Another strategy is to integrate disaster risk reduction concepts 
and methodologies in public investments, as the governments of 
both Peru and Costa Rica have done (Table 12.5h). 

Strengthening weather monitoring and forecasting tools: early 
warning systems, one of the main branches of disaster risk 
reduction, include the monitoring and forecasting of impending 
events (UNISDR 2006). A number of key intergovernmental 
organizations work to further early warning policy at the sub-
regional level under the Hyogo Framework for Action and 
through the Regional Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction. 
Among them are the following: the Centre for Natural Disaster 
Prevention and Coordination (CEPREDENAC) in Central America; 
the Andean Committee for Disaster Awareness and Prevention 
(CAPRADE); and the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management 
Agency (CDEMA); as well as humanitarian networks such as the 
recent REDHU (Humanitarian Assistance of MERCOSUR). Cuba, 
Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean small islands have 
implemented weather monitoring and forecasting tools that 
protect populations from injury and disease (Table 12.5i, j).

Although the region’s early warning systems lessen the loss of 
life, decrease injuries and mitigate against property damage, 
the World Meteorological Organization stresses the need 
to re-evaluate national and local emergency preparedness 
and response plans, which should be based on hazard and 
vulnerability mapping. It also stresses that countries should 
strengthen their monitoring and forecasting infrastructure and 
the skills of technical agencies while improving access to data 
and technology; strengthen dissemination channels that link 
national early warning systems to communities focusing on 
cultural and community needs; and address sustainability issues 
on the basis of available resources (WMO 2009).
 
Adaptation policies for social resilience: decreasing vulnerability 
while increasing resilience is central to development, 
environmental sustainability, climate change adaptation and

services (ISDR 2009) as well as technological alternatives. 
Examples of good policy instruments are the region’s agroforestry 
systems and the Rainforest Alliance’s Climate Module, which 
fosters the adoption of good agricultural practices to reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions and to enhance the capacity of farms 
to adapt to climate change in Central America (Table 12.5k) 
(Rainforest Alliance 2011).

Households, communities and the larger society are increasingly 
adopting approaches that protect them against the negative 
impacts of climate change. These include good public policies, 
such as providing public health services, education, social 
protection schemes, and supporting active and efficient civil 
society organizations or government agencies, a solid and well 
maintained infrastructure, good governance and healthy public 
finances (Verner 2011). 

There are examples of ecologically oriented social policy in 
Brazil, including Bolsa Verde (Box 12.9), which provides funds 
to the very poor who work towards environmental conservation, 
and the State of Amazonas Bolsa Floresta programme (Table 
12.5l) (Gebara 2010; May and Millikan 2010). Other examples 
of policies that increase social resilience come from Bolivia, 
Colombia, Nicaragua and Peru (Table 12.5m, n, o, p).

Promoting emissions reduction through sustainable forest 
management, native forest protection and rehabilitation
Maintaining existing forests can be one of the most efficient and 
cost-effective options for mitigating CO2 emissions, as can be seen 
in Brazil, Central America and Mexico (UNEP et al. 2010a; Börner 
and Wunder 2008; Kanninen et al. 2007). Protecting and restoring 
native forests – vitally important in sustaining the livelihoods and 
cultural heritage of many Latin American and Caribbean peoples 
– is promoted through such sustainable forest management 
strategies and results-based payment schemes as REDD+ (Cerbu 
et al. 2011) or the recently created Amazon Fund in Brazil (MMA 
2008). Such strategies should focus on carefully integrating 
and providing benefits to rural and indigenous communities, as 
there are strong potential synergies with efforts to protect and 
rehabilitate forest resources (Chhatre and Agrawal 2010; Pereira 
2010; Stickler et al. 2009). Policy action can rely on a variety of 
instruments, including payment for ecosystem services, public- 
and private-sector engagement or command and control, as such 
approaches can make REDD+ more effective in curbing greenhouse 
gas emissions (Ezzine-de-Blas et al. 2011). Peru’s Forest 
Conservation Programme (MINAM 2011), Bolsa Verde of Brazil 
(Box 12.9), as well as environmental services certificates, payment 
for ecosystem services and forest credits in Costa Rica (FONAFIFO 
programme) are examples of the region’s forest conservation 
policy instruments (UNEP 2010b; Kanninen et al. 2007).

Successful efforts at knowledge generation, long-term policies 
on forest management, and native forest protection and 
restoration schemes typically strive to provide better information 
on the value of forest functions and products; strengthen 
multi-stakeholder involvement; create stronger links between 
legal, social, environmental, economic and technological tools;

disaster risk reduction (Figure 12.6). Policy efforts can be 
integrated around this central challenge (GEF 2011). 

Climate change adaptation policies based on social inclusion 
embrace challenges and opportunities associated with addressing 
the needs of all segments of the region’s population. They are 
particularly sensitive to the most vulnerable, such as the rural and 
urban poor and indigenous peoples with traditional lifestyles. 
 
The region’s rural households depend heavily on agriculture. 
Thus, adaptation strategies for coping with the impacts of climate 
change on agricultural productivity and food security among poor 
rural households need to include access to such key elements 
as land, labour, fertilizers, irrigation, infrastructure and financial 

Box 12.9 Brazil’s Bolsa Verde

This national-level strategy within the purview of the Brasil 
Sem Miseria programme envisions the distribution of 
funds to families living in extreme poverty who promote 
environmental conservation in the areas where they live 
and work. Coordinated by the Ministry of Environment, the 
programme includes environmental capacity building in 
forest management. Now in its initial stages, the Bolsa Verde 
has the goal of benefiting nearly 73 000 small-farm families 
and other traditional communities living in conservation units 
and land-reform settlements that contain important forest 
resources (Planalto 2011).

and critically evaluate the effectiveness of their objectives by 
continuously monitoring greenhouse gas emissions reduction 
and local sustainable development (Corbera and Schroeder 
2011; Thompson et al. 2011; Cherrington et al. 2010; Betts et al. 
2008; Cortner 2000).

Encouraging diversification of the energy matrix 
International prices play a decisive role in defining Latin America 
and the Caribbean’s policies related to fossil fuels. Renewable 
energy sources have been developed to address growing energy 
needs (Box 12.10), with hydroelectric projects the preferred 
energy investment. 

Renewable energy sources are a positive alternative to fossil 
fuels; nevertheless, renewable energy projects can affect the 
environment and the livelihoods of local communities and, as a 
result, need to be planned carefully. Given the region’s diverse 
potential for renewable energy – biomass, solar, wind, wave 
and geothermal – the policy cluster in this section proposes the 
introduction of renewable sources to the energy matrix.

The benefits of renewable energy sources include: 
•	 the	decentralization	of	investment	towards	less	developed	
regions, which helps create jobs (for qualified personnel), 
capacity building and technology transfer (Edenhofer et al. 
2011; De la Torre et al. 2009; Sims et al. 2007; Szklo et al. 
2005);

•	 a	cost-effective	alternative	to	expensive	grid	extensions	

(Jacobson and Delucchi 2011); La Rovere et al. 2011); and 

•	 great	potential	to	lower	emission	costs	effectively	(Sims	
et al. 2007; Szklo et al. 2005), thereby reducing energy 
dependence and positively affecting trade balances. 

The suggested policies combine long-term feed-in tariffs with 
subsidies and tax incentives as ways to provide investment and 
financial support for the supply chain of electricity generated 

from renewables, including the transformation of raw materials, 
manufacturing, and installation of components and systems. 

Depending on the policy and regulatory mechanism, renewable 
energy may increase consumers’ energy costs in the short term. 
However, income-specific tariffs financed by reallocating counter-
productive subsidies for non-renewable sources can often help to 
balance this distortion. If, however, oil prices fall, the opportunity 
cost may decrease to levels that might not cover costs. This can 
be addressed by introducing quota-based incentive programmes 
and long-term contracts with stable prices (De la Torre et al. 
2009; Guzowsky and Recalde 2008). Adopting policies that 
subsidize the use of renewable sources in terms of installed 
capacity (kilowatts), or pay per kilowatt hour generated and sold, 
can help to improve renewable energy. Likewise, mechanisms 
such as green certificates, research and development subsides, 
internalization of external costs and environmental taxes can 
foster an increase in the share of renewable energy sources in the 
energy matrix (Guzowsky and Recalde 2008).

Policies involving smart grids and decentralized power 
generation have the potential to promote greater generation, 
transport and distribution efficiency and to simultaneously scale 
up renewables, specifically solar and biomass. Complementarily, 
transboundary cooperation and integration in the energy 
sector have been shown to increase electricity supply, widen 
coverage and enhance system functionality across the region. 
The Renewable Energy Observatory of Latin America, the Energy 
and Climate Change Partnership for the Americas and the 
Mesoamerican Electric Interconnection are examples of policy 
strategies related to regional cooperation in the energy sector. 
The Tender System for Alternative Renewable Energies in Brazil 
and the Energy Strategy Guidelines from Uruguay (Table 12.5q, r) 
encourage diversification of the energy matrix.

Enhancing efficiency and low-carbon mobility
These policy options aim to reduce energy demand in the residential 
sector and transport systems while providing more effective 
and expanded energy distribution to the population. Financial 
instruments, such as cap-and-trade systems and carbon taxes, 
funds for research and development and compliance instruments 
might be adopted as part of the same strategy. A proposed 
reorganization of public transport systems would improve the 
efficiency of fossil-fuel use and road space, and change the 
paradigm from individual and private to public and inclusive. 

Related policy strategies foster the use of minimum standards 
of energy efficiency for electrical appliances (lighting, cooling 
and heating) and individual vehicles (fuel efficiency standards 
and the promotion of hybrid cars); and the adoption of energy 
efficiency stamp programmes and specific nationally appropriate 
mitigation action. To this end, it is essential to combine public 
financing instruments, market initiatives and specific policies 
for research and development, as well as technology transfer 
to enhance the international transfer of resources associated 
with new technologies. Table 12.5 (s, t, u) provides examples of 
associated policy options.

Latin America and the Caribbean 341

The main benefits of these strategies will be realized over the 
long term. Some studies reveal that energy efficiency policies 
have usually reduced implementation costs (Mckinsey and 
Company 2009; Mckinsey Global Institute 2008a, 2008b, 
2007). Furthermore, these policies can help reduce the negative 
impacts on human health by improving air quality; decrease 
external energy dependency; increase the reliability of power 
supply; control demand growth with the potential to reduce 
energy consumption by 20–25 per cent (ECLAC 2010b); increase 
productivity and employment; increase the efficiency and 
competitiveness of domestic energy-intensive industry (Romm 
1999); and diminish congestion in cities.

In conjunction with its residential energy efficiency policies, Latin 
America and the Caribbean has demonstrated the potential to 
further expand the green design and building market, especially 
for social housing. One exemplary effort is the government of 
Mexico’s This is Your House initiative and the National Housing 
Commission’s associated Green Mortgage Programme (Comisión 
Nacional de Vivienda or CONAVI). The government of Brazil is 
developing initiatives in this vein through the Ministry of Cities’ 
planning instruments within the framework of its Multiannual 
Plan for Decent Living.

Co-benefits and links between policy options and 
environmental priorities
To address the complexity of environmental issues, 
environmental policy making is evolving to transcend traditional, 

compartmentalized approaches by becoming more integrated 
and cross-sectoral in nature (UNEP 2009; Persson 2004). This 
chapter has presented clusters of policies that are believed to 
have strong co-benefits. An assessment of the policies in the 
clusters deemed them to be the most co-dependent and mutually 
supportive policies required to achieve the internationally agreed 
goals chosen for each thematic issue.

Moreover, in a number of instances the policies or policy clusters 
associated with certain themes were underscored as benefiting, 
or being strongly linked with, other policies and environmental 
themes. Apart from being advantageous to the environment, 
these policies have positive socio-economic and political 
impacts. In addition to biodiversity management, policies 
promoting payment for ecosystem services, for example, are used 
across a number of issues and in almost all sectors, including 
land, water and climate change. Policies that focus on integrated 
management of water resources or the ecosystem approach can 
also benefit other sectors such as agriculture, fisheries, forestry 
and land. Many of the climate change policies will ultimately 
co-benefit the management of land, water and biodiversity 
resources. Policy makers may find that understanding the links 
and co-benefits is useful in determining how to maximize the 
efficiency of existing policies or measures, and in prioritizing the 
development and implementation of new ones.

It is beyond this chapter’s scope to provide an in-depth analysis 
of all possible links and co-benefits, but policy makers may find

CONCLUSIONS
Latin America and the Caribbean’s ecosystems and associated 
natural capital are important to both the region’s countries 
and to the entire planet. However, persistent negative 
environmental and related socio-economic trends are a 
clear indication that the measures so far established and 
implemented to protect them – at national, sub-national or 
supra-national levels – are insufficient to address either the 
rate or scale of conversion and consumption prevalent within 
the region. As a result, Latin American and Caribbean countries 
continue to face such issues as poverty, inequity and social 
conflict related to environmental quality.

Throughout this chapter, consideration has been given to 
policies, approaches and instruments that have demonstrated 
the potential to improve sustainability in the region, especially 
for the issues deemed of highest regional priority. 

The most salient point arising from the assessment of 
policy options is that strong environmental governance is 
a cornerstone for ensuring the success of policies geared 
at improving sustainability. Without strong governance 
frameworks to support environmental decision making, efforts 
to ensure greater environmental sustainability are unlikely to be 
effective. The following factors were identified as fundamental 
for strengthening governance frameworks: 
•	 adequate	financial	resources;	
•	 access	to	scientific	research	and	information;
•	 environmental	education	and	the	development	of	an	

environmental culture; 

•	 the	standard	governance	principles	and	values	of	

transparency, accountability, equity, sustainability and 
inclusive participation of all stakeholders; and

•	 continuity	in	political	systems.	

The current limited impact of policies addressing environmental 
trends also highlights the need to emphasize the root causes 
that drive change throughout the region. Too often, policies 
tend to focus on the direct pressures affecting ecosystems 
and their services, because these are the best understood or 
they are easiest to deal with. However, until policies begin to 
address some of the deeper, underlying causes of environmental 
degradation – or drivers as defined in Chapter 1 – countries are 
unlikely to meet the goals and targets set out in international, 
regional and national agreements. There is, thus, a need to invest 
more in understanding these drivers and the ways they work 
together. Greater integration of environmental considerations 
into broader development processes is also needed.

The thematic issues covered have highlighted the 
interconnectedness of, and links between and among 
environmental issues. Most of the policy clusters are likely to 
benefit multiple sectors, once properly implemented. Thus, a 
close examination of cross-sectoral benefits is an important 

The full effects of decisions taken, or not taken, today will affect the 
opportunities available to young people and their future families. The 
Brundtland Commission summed this up in its definition of sustainable 
development: “satisfying the needs of the present generation without 
compromising the chance for future generations to satisfy theirs”.

strategy for policy-makers to apply when considering the 
priorities and trade-offs associated with implementing  
a policy or a cluster of policies. 

This chapter suggests that existing policies, mechanisms and 
institutional frameworks at the sub-national, national and 
regional levels in Latin America and the Caribbean offer a good 
starting point for strengthening environmental management. In 
many instances, it is not necessary to reinvent policies and their 
implementation, or to continue adding to the already saturated 
landscape of policies. Rather, what is required is a closer 
examination of existing policies and institutions to see how 
better to enable and strengthen them to serve more effectively. 
This approach could help to circumvent the long, sometimes 
onerous, processes required to build policies and/or new 
institutions from the ground up, and could accelerate the rate 
at which countries can work towards meeting internationally 
agreed goals.
 
Finally, cooperation is an important element in improving 
sustainability in the region. Cooperation between and among its 
countries would facilitate the sharing of information, expertise 
and technology transfer – the lack of which may currently limit 
countries in moving to more sustainable paths of development. 
It could also help to improve the management of ecosystems 
and species, which commonly cross national boundaries. 
Cooperation at a global level is also important to ensure that 
the region’s natural capital is maintained and shared in a 
sustainable and equitable manner.

Main Messages 

Policies and innovative market-based instruments 
are becoming more successful in improving 
environmental conditions in North America when 
they work in concert and in a political environment 
that allows for sound implementation. For example, 
the US Clean Air Act includes a cap-and-trade 
market mechanism to reduce sulphur dioxide (SO2) 
emissions that costs less for each unit reduced than 
traditional environmental regulation. In addition, it 
is estimated that the Clean Air Act’s direct benefit to 
human health and the environment will reach almost 
US$2 trillion by 2020, compared to the US$65 billion 
implementation cost. In Canada, Ontario’s Green 
Energy and Green Economy Act supports a feed-in 
tariff that has contributed to the growth in renewable 
energy; wind production in Ontario, for example, 
increased from 15 megawatts in 2003 to more than 
1 100 megawatts in 2009.

Pricing externalities and integrated land 
management have shown the potential to increase 
the sustainability of land-use practices in North 
America. Governments can efficiently diminish 
environmental impacts by paying land managers 
for implementing best management practices 
such as riparian buffers, reduced tillage and 
reduced fertilizer application. In the United States, 
taxes and other incentives have increased the 
total area conserved by local, state and national 
land trusts to almost 15 million hectares, while 
payment for ecosystem service programmes, such 
as farmland preservation programmes that bring 
together the various benefits to society of farmland 
and agricultural production, have permanently 
preserved another 92 million hectares. The US 

Conservation Reserve Program also pays farmers 
to withdraw land from production in order to  
restore soils, providing benefits estimated at 
US$1.3 billion per year, excluding carbon 
sequestration, ecosystem protection and other  
less easily quantified benefits. 

The integrated watershed approach, in combination 
with technological instruments and economic 
incentives, has proved to be effective in addressing 
some complex water resource challenges in North 
America. Currently, the United States and Canada 
administer this approach through initiatives at the 
bi-national, regional or state/provincial levels rather 
than nationally. The Great Lakes and St Lawrence 
Cities Initiative, a cross-jurisdictional programme, 
has successfully increased water efficiency and 
reduced demand across the Great Lakes region. 

Increasing renewable energy as a part of the total 
primary energy supply provides multiple benefits. 
Case studies from states and provinces in North 
America indicate that a comprehensive policy 
approach leads to rapid expansion of renewable 
energy production. However, development across 
jurisdictions has been uneven and current policy 
regimes are not adequate to realize the necessary 
paradigm shift to achieve a sustainable energy 
system. This shift will lead to significant reductions 
in greenhouse gas emissions, and increasing 
renewable energy production is an integral part of 
this transition. Research shows that by increasing 
renewable energy deployment globally, up to 85 per 
cent of all carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions could be 
avoided by 2050 (IPCC 2011).

Part 2: Policy Options

INTRODUCTION
As previously indicated, GEO-5 shifts the GEO focus from 
identifying environmental problems to identifying solutions that 
governments can then prioritize. This chapter provides examples 
of a number of policy options and market mechanisms that have 
shown some success in improving environmental conditions 
in North America. They are organized by priority environmental 
theme and their success is related to how they may have 
helped to speed up the attainment of selected international 
environmental goals.

The priority themes and related global goals for the North 
American region of Canada and the United States were chosen 
during two regional GEO consultations (Table 13.1). In addition 
to the four priority issues of environmental governance, land 
use, freshwater and energy, this chapter also addresses the 
overarching theme of climate change, which is discussed within 
each of the four thematic sections. 

Subsequently, the chapter reviews existing policy approaches, 
institutional arrangements and market mechanisms related to 
environmental and natural resources management. The aim is 
to identify relatively successful policy options that are currently 
being implemented to address each of the priority issues, and 
that would also address the related internationally agreed 
goals. To single out those with most potential to speed up the 
attainment of the associated goals, the resulting options were 
subjected to the following criteria, with policies selected if they 
met some, but not necessarily all, of these criteria:
•	 responds	to,	and/or	reinforces	or	fosters	interactions	and	

synergies among the priority issues, policy options, regions 
and/or actors; 

•	 has	the	potential	for	replication	elsewhere;

•	 has	the	potential	for	scale-up;
•	 addresses	drivers	and	pressures	rather	than	end-of-pipe	

solutions;

•	 focuses	on	transboundary	aspects	of	the	issues	and	regional	

solutions;

•	 can	operate	as	part	of	a	cluster	of	policies	that,	if	implemented	

together, are more beneficial than the sum of the separate 
policies.

Clusters of policy instruments were selected for each of the four 
areas, and to further refine the assessment, a select number 
of policies deemed to be the most successful were analysed 
according to their benefits and drawbacks, the perceived trade-
offs of implementing them, and whether their effectiveness could 
be measured by any specific indicators. In addition, a number 
of case studies were identified to illustrate how the policies and 
instruments work in different contexts.

Ultimately, the policies selected are the result of the appraisal 
process involving a review of the literature and government 
data, multi-stakeholder consultations and expert opinion. 
Although the survey was thorough, the policy options were those 
that could be gleaned by this process and do not represent an 
exhaustive and comprehensive search; neither do they reflect 
relative importance compared to those that were not selected. 
Whether the policy would be effective in a different context 
and on a different scale is uncertain: for many policies, direct 
causal evidence of effectiveness is limited. The success of policy 
instruments depends on their historical, political, cultural, 
economic and social context. Moreover, each instrument should 
be evaluated relative to its environmental effectiveness across 
sectors; its politico-administrative effectiveness in terms of ease 
of environmental monitoring and validity for decision making;

Land use

We acknowledge that the advancement of the concept of a green economy in the context of sustainable 
development and poverty eradication can significantly address current challenges, deliver development 
opportunities and multiple benefits for all nations.
Develop and implement integrated land management and water-use plans that are based on sustainable use of 
renewable resources and on integrated assessments of socio-economic and environmental potential.

Improve the efficient use of water resources and promote their allocation among competing uses in a way 
that gives priority to the satisfaction of basic human needs and balances the requirement of preserving 
or restoring ecosystems and their functions, in particular in fragile environments, with human domestic, 
industrial and agriculture needs, including safeguarding drinking water quality.

states and provinces or municipalities, as well as to regional 
transborder cooperation. The latter is extensive and continues 
to expand, and its dynamics are further supported by the 
Commission for Environmental Cooperation, which oversees 
the environmental accord of the North American Free Trade 
Agreement (NAFTA).

The examples of policy options on environmental governance 
given in the following pages are suggested as ways of helping 
to address these current challenges. In addition, they could 
help speed up the attainment of Paragraph 13 of the Nusa Dua 
Declaration, which proposes advancing the green economy, and 
of paragraph 40b of the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation, 
which charges decision makers to “develop and implement 
integrated land management and water-use plans”. 

Freshwater
The United States and Canada respectively contain 6 and 5 
per cent of global renewable water resources, ranking third 
and fourth overall among nations (FAO 2011). Because of its 
relative high quality and abundance, water in North America 
is often taken for granted, although more recently there is 
recognition of a looming water crisis. Freshwater issues that 
remain a challenge in some parts of the region include droughts 
and floods (Cayan et al. 2010; Easterling 2000), eutrophication 
(Smith et al. 2006), dams and river fragmentation (Chapter 4), 
saltwater intrusion (Barlow and Reichard 2010), contamination 
caused by hydraulic fracturing for natural gas extraction (Kargbo 
et al. 2010), non-point source pollution from agricultural (Ritter 
and Shirmohammadi 2001; Novotny 1999) and urban run-off 
(NRC 2008). Climate change may exacerbate these problems by 
altering both water supply and demand (Vörösmarty et al. 2010, 
2000; Bates et al. 2008). 

Since freshwater provides ecosystem services that are central to 
human health, it is critical to ensure a continued good-quality 
supply. This chapter provides a number of policy options to 
illustrate ways of speeding up the achievement of Paragraph 26c 
of the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation, which stipulates 
that the efficient use of water resources is to be improved and 
human needs and ecosystem requirements balanced.

Land use
Land use is a priority issue in North America because it presents 
both significant environmental concerns and great potential for 
sustainable development. The natural resource and agricultural 
sectors contribute significantly to employment and wealth 
generation; for example, more than 2 million people in the 
United States work in or support the forestry and agriculture 
industries (BLS 2011), and in Canada, gross domestic product 
(GDP) for agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting totalled 
US$24.7 billion in 2010 (Industry Canada 2011). In addition, 
citizen engagement and people’s high level of attachment to 
natural areas have moved land use up on the political agenda. 
These and other factors, such as fossil fuel extraction and 
urban development, apply significant pressure on land, often 
resulting in conflicts over its use. Policy options addressing

its contribution to international goals and commitments; and 
its political feasibility. Whether there are resources adequate to 
implement a policy, what policy options can be most successfully 
applied in each region to help accelerate achievement of 
internationally agreed goals, and the potential for replication, 
scale-up and transfer are all research questions about which few 
rigorous studies, if any, exist. 

North America is considered a global economic leader, although 
changes in regional demographics, rapidly emerging global 
economies and resource constraints all challenge the region’s 
provision of public goods and services. At the same time, 
fragmented governance, policy instability, lack of clear targets 
and science policy, and the dilemma of whether to address 
global issues rather than seeking local solutions hampers the 
achievement of environmental goals (Chapter 1).

Environmental governance
Environmental governance in North America is best characterized 
as multi-faceted, partly reflecting the nature of the federal 
political systems, ideological flux, evolving socio-economic 
constraints, and the dynamics of environmental issues as well 
as the knowledge associated with them. Federal governments 
are no longer the primary leaders in setting the policy agenda 
or devising innovative policy instruments, yet they remain 
essential to the ultimate success of those policies, help ensure 
harmonization across jurisdictions and prevent the development 
of environmental inequities. In addition, there is a strong 
tendency to favour market-based instruments because of early 
successes, and to overlook traditional regulatory instruments. 
Finally, relative federal disengagement has opened the door to 
policy initiatives and innovations at the sub-national levels of

land management and water-use plans so as to use renewable 
resources more sustainably.

Energy
The international goal of urgently increasing renewable energy 
resources as a part of the total energy supply (Johannesburg 
Plan of Implementation, Paragraph 20e) was selected to 
address multiple challenges associated with the current energy 
system. These challenges include the contribution of fossil fuel 
combustion to climate change, elevated water consumption 
and air pollution. However, renewable energy also presents 
opportunities for sustainable development through increased 
employment and economic activity and is a necessary element 
in the transition to a green, sustainable economy. In addition, 
the processes required for site generation and transmission 
facilities present opportunities for increasing transparency and 
cross-agency cooperation, and would also benefit environmental 
governance and land use. Although the pace of change is still 
slow, the policy options for increasing renewable energy are 
examples of current tools applied in North America to speed up 
the transition to a sustainable energy system. 

POLICY APPRAISAL 
Environmental governance
North America has used a variety of policy approaches 
to environmental governance, beginning with regulatory 
policies, then gradually developing market mechanisms, 
complemented by measures designed to improve accountability 
and transparency. The region was a pioneer in cross-border 
governance, which dates back at least to the 1909 Boundary 
Waters Treaty, and in developing international environmental 
law and national parks, including cross-border parks. In the 
last 20 years, this governance has deepened cross-border 
ties through the creation of the Conference of New England 
Governors/Eastern Canadian Premiers on climate change and 
the Commission for Environmental Cooperation (CEC 2011; 
Johnson and Beaulieu 1996), and by reinforcing cooperation 
between provinces and states in managing the Great Lakes and 
St Lawrence River (Box 13.5), as well as on a variety of other 
issues, notably protection of waterbirds and sea mammals. 
The Georgia Basin/Puget Sound International Airshed Strategy 
in British Columbia and Washington State, for example, is 
currently the most active bilateral arrangement regarding air 
quality (Environment Canada 2011). For their part, the proposed 
creation of watershed boards across the entire Canadian/US 
border would represent a major leap in the International Joint 
Commission’s regulatory potential (Schwartz 2006). Canada 
and the United States have also established several jointly 
protected areas that further harmonize policies. 

North America has pioneered the use of many market 
instruments, now being used with increasing frequency, and 
there is evidence that some have succeeded in changing 
behaviour. Command-and-control mechanisms, however, still 

form the backbone of environmental policy. Because of recent 
improvements in measures designed to foster accountability and 
transparency, these increasingly used instruments strengthen 
the effectiveness of both market instruments and command-and-
control mechanisms. Rarely are any of these used exclusively 
to address a particular environmental issue; it is more common 
to see a variety of instruments applied. For example, to address 
littering, many North American municipalities and states or 
provinces have laws that require a deposit on bottles and cans. 
This deposit provides a financial incentive – a market instrument 
– to return the items for recycling. In conjunction, bottles and 
cans in certain states must clearly display a recycling logo 
representing the type of material used and providing easy-to-
understand and transparent information about recycling. Finally, 
various regions have banned the inclusion of bottles and cans in 
solid waste – a command-and-control form of regulation. 

Market mechanisms 
Market instruments have been used to address a variety of 
environmental issues in North America. The most recent have 
targeted air quality and climate change and include an acid 
rain reduction programme, a greenhouse gas emissions trading 
programme in the northeastern states and eastern provinces, 
and a carbon tax in Quebec (2007) and British Columbia (2008) 
(Box 13.1). Payment for ecosystem services is also gaining wider 
attention, although such schemes remain limited.

In 1995, the United States instituted a cap-and-trade emissions 
programme, stemming from amendments to the 1990 Clean Air 
Act (under Title IV), to reduce sulphur dioxide (SO2) emissions, 
the major industrial pollutant responsible for acid rain. This 
programme is widely credited with reducing sulphur dioxide 
emissions more cheaply than traditional environmental regulation.

Box 13.1 The Quebec and British Columbia carbon taxes

In 2007, Quebec became the first North American state or 
province to introduce a carbon tax. Energy companies are 
required to pay 0.8 cents for each litre of petrol distributed 
in Quebec and 0.938 cents for each litre of diesel fuel. 
Compared to other jurisdictions, however, this tax rate is 
very low. The revenue-neutral carbon tax in place in British 
Columbia since 2008 is much more ambitious. Rate increases 
were phased in, starting at a modest US$10 per tonne of 
CO2-equivalent in 2008 and then increasing at a rate of US$5 
a year to US$30 a tonne in 2012. The tax’s revenue neutrality 
is achieved by allowing tax reductions for businesses as 
well as tax reductions for and payments to poorer sections 
of society. The comprehensive tax applies to all emissions 
from fossil fuels, accounting for approximately 70 per cent 

of the province’s total emissions. Emissions from fossil fuels 
exported from British Columbia to other jurisdictions are 
exempt. In 2010, the tax began to apply to biodiesel as well 
(BC Ministry of Finance 2008). The new tax did not seem to 
have significant political repercussions – the provincial party 
that introduced it was re-elected. 

Addressing drawbacks typically associated with carbon taxes 
may have enhanced its acceptability. This includes mitigating or 
eliminating the potentially regressive nature of carbon taxation 
(Metcalf and Weisbach 2008), with comprehensive coverage 
combined with targeted tax reductions, and reducing potentially 
large adaptation costs for carbon-intensive industries through a 
gradual phase-in of the tax (Nordhaus 2010).

Early projections of the average cost for the first phase of the 
programme ranged from a high of US$307 per tonne of sulphur 
dioxide removed to US$180 per tonne (1995 dollars). Ellerman et 
al. (2000) estimated that the actual costs were closer to the low 
end of the projections, in the range of US$186–210 per tonne. In 
addition, a 2011 US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) review 
of the direct benefits to human health and the environment of the 
Clean Air Act estimates that these will reach almost US$2 trillion 
by 2020 while implementation costs are US$65 billion – a benefit-
cost ratio of 30:1. This was probably due to the flexibility afforded 
to producers to find low-cost compliance measures, although 
other factors such as unanticipated technical improvements, 
lower transport costs and increases in coal production and use 
efficiencies also played important roles (Chestnut and Mills 
2005). Although the costs of many regulatory programmes tend to 
be overestimated while they are being developed, recent research 
found that this has been especially the case for market-based 
programmes (Harrington et al. 2008).

The success of the sulphur dioxide trading programme has in part 
prompted several jurisdictions in Canada to increase the use of 
market-based instruments. As of 2007, the Alberta greenhouse 
gas emissions trading system, for example, requires large 
industrial emitters that have been established more than eight 
years to reduce the intensity of greenhouse gas emissions by 12 
per cent per year relative to a 2003–2005 baseline (Can LII 2011), 
and purchase carbon offsets or else pay a tax of US$15 per tonne 
of CO2-equivalent. While the programme may result in reduced 
emissions compared to the business-as-usual alternative, it has 
been heavily criticised for permitting overall increases in carbon 
emissions by only targeting emissions intensity. In this sense it is 
not a typical cap-and-trade programme. 

A less developed scheme, but one that is emblematic of the 
readiness of some states and provinces to compensate for 
perceived federal inaction, is the Western Climate Initiative, 
which combines seven US states and four Canadian provinces. 

This has been working since 2007 to develop policies to address 
climate change, including a regional, economy-wide cap-and-
trade programme and forest offset mechanisms (Anderson et 
al. 2010). Only some of the initiative’s members – California, 
Quebec and British Columbia – are currently taking preparatory 
steps towards implementing this programme in 2012.

Water trading between Canada and the United States and efforts 
to allocate water efficiently and equitably among various users 
have triggered considerable political controversy, even before 
the United Nations acknowledged access to clean water and 
sanitation as a fundamental human right in 2010. Trading water 
rights, from farms to cities, for example, can be viewed as making 
farmland unproductive and favouring urban dwellers over rural 
residents. In addition, many civil society organizations see the 
privatization of some water rights as incompatible with the 
principle of universal and equal access to water. 

Water markets, or transferrable water rights, are generally 
most developed in regions where water allocation is based on 
first-in-time, first-in-right or the doctrine of prior appropriation 
(Kenney 2005). In the United States, water markets are prevalent 
in the arid western states, and in Canada, water trading occurs 
in Alberta and to a lesser extent in British Columbia and the 
Territories. The benefits of water trading include the reallocation 
of water from lower- to higher-value economic uses or from 
areas where the marginal value is low to where it is high. For 
instance, where urban users pay much higher rates for water 
than do rural and agricultural users, trading makes both water 
buyers and sellers better off economically. There are numerous 
drawbacks, however. For example, the market value of water 
may not correspond to its in situ environmental value. Moreover, 
the impact on local water may be externalized to third parties, 
including changes to the local economy and environmental 
effects from reduced local water availability (Hanak 2003). Other 
drawbacks pertain to the very principle promoted by some groups 
that water should remain a public good and therefore should 

354

Part 2: Policy Options

not be commoditized and traded for profit, the ability of private 
parties to monopolize the water resources market, and the 
distortion of the water trading market due to substantial water 
subsidies for the agricultural sector.

Subsidies and tariffs for clean energy, agricultural production and 
industrial goods can facilitate the adoption of new, less polluting 
technologies or projects that enhance energy conservation. 
Subsidies for installing water-efficient fixtures or the California 
subsidy programme on residential solar installation, which 
encourages distributed electrical generation as well as emission-
free power production, are two such examples. The Ontario 
Feed-in Tariff programme, enabled by the 2009 Green Energy 
and Green Economy Act (Box 13.2), offers stable prices for 
energy provided by renewable sources and supports Ontario’s 
objective to phase out coal-fired electricity generation by 2014. 
This programme has contributed to greater reliance on renewable 
energy sources in Ontario, such as wind power, which increased 
from 15 megawatts in 2003 to more than 1 100 megawatts in 
2009 (Government of Ontario 2009). 

While subsidies may help promote technological change, they 
have also been criticized for increasing the risk of pollution, 
encouraging overconsumption, and fostering the rapid depletion 
of natural resources (ten Brink 2011). Agricultural subsidies 
have come under the greatest scrutiny not only because of 
their pervasive environmental effects on land use, but also for 
their negative impact on the agricultural sector and exports of 
developing countries. Both Canada and the United States also 

continue to provide large subsidies for the production of non-
renewable energy, often in the form of low tax rates for capital 
investment (Kenny et al. 2011; Congressional Budget Office 
2005), despite the commitment to the contrary made by the 
G20 economies in 2009 in Pittsburgh (G20 2009). While some 
potentially environmentally harmful subsidies may have social 
or other worthwhile objectives, many may not be equitable, may 
no longer fulfil their original purpose, or may have unintended 
outcomes as a result of market distortions. There are many 
instances where subsidies have either directly or indirectly 
distorted the market or caused unintended consequences: for 
example, declining block rate structures for water use, where 
marginal costs decrease as a function of the total amount of 
water used, encourage overconsumption.

Payment for ecosystem services, which in one form or another 
has been used for years but has lately triggered considerable 
renewed interest, is designed to safeguard or increase the 
provision of an ecosystem service for which there is high demand 
but currently no market mechanism. The US Conservation 
Reserve Program, which provides continuous direct payments 
to farmers for withdrawing land from production and engaging 
in soil restoration, is a long-standing and successful example. 
The US Economic Research Service (ERS) conservatively 
estimates the programme’s benefits to be US$1.3 billion per 
year, excluding carbon sequestration, ecosystem protection and 
other less easily quantified benefits (Hellerstein 2010). Other 
significant ecological benefits include the reversal of landscape 
fragmentation, maintenance of regional biodiversity, creation 

Box 13.2 Ontario: a comprehensive approach to energy

The provincial energy system in Ontario has undergone a 
number of reforms in the last 30 years. The province had a 
vertically integrated monopoly until the mid-1990s, but in 1998 
moved towards a more market-based model. In 2004, policies 
were again revised and a hybrid model put in place, in which 
overall system planning was under one agency; nonetheless, 
the direction was still towards a market-based model. During 
this same period, major interruptions occurred with the 
infrastructure, including the overhaul of seven of 20 nuclear 
power plants, leading to increased use of coal-fired generation, 
resulting in major emissions increases with concerns over 
both the health effects and greenhouse gases. In turn, these 
concerns led to political pressure and in 2004 the province 
decided to phase out coal generation as part of a strategy to 
address climate change and reduce the human impacts and 
health-care costs of air pollution (Winfield et al. 2010). 

To achieve the goal, Ontario implemented a variety of 
conservation and renewable energy initiatives, including 
the Green Energy and Green Economy Act, a broad-based 
instrument that enabled the province to implement a 
comprehensive system of renewable energy feed-in tariffs 

in 2009. The Ontario feed-in tariff programme provides 
stable long-term contracts and generation prices specifically 
tailored for wind, solar, micro-hydro and biomass projects. 
It also provides a consolidated siting authority, smart grid 
provisions and additional benefits to attract community energy 
initiatives and First Nations involvement. The act provided the 
comprehensive package of policies that created incentives, 
stimulated new methods to move energy to markets and 
streamlined the project permission process. 

The results of the Green Energy and Green Economy Act have 
been impressive. The Ontario Power Authority has received supply 
applications for the production of 10.4 gigawatts of wind power 
and 6.7 gigawatts of solar photovolatic power; by 2011, there 
were approximately 3.0 gigawatts of renewable electric power 
under contract. The provincial power authority also estimated 
that the renewable energy sector had created 13 000 direct and 
indirect jobs through the most recent contracts awarded (Mabee 
et al. 2012). The Ontario model is currently being considered in 
other Canadian provinces including British Columbia and Nova 
Scotia (Yatchew and Baziliauskas 2011; Ontario Ministry of 
Energy 2010; Power Authority of Ontario 2010).

of wildlife habitat and favourable changes in regional carbon 
flux (Gleason et al. 2008; Haufler 2005; Dunn et al. 1993). The 
Environmental Quality Incentives Program and the Conservation 
Security Program of 2002 are two more recent and wide-
ranging programmes that seek to reward farmers for sound land 
management from a multi-functionality perspective. For the same 
budgetary outlay, the ERS found that environmental performance 
could improve 12-fold, including an estimated 17 per cent 
reduction in soil erosion – saving about 36 million tonnes of soil 
valued at about US$2 per tonne, although the value of reducing 
sheet and rill erosion alone could be as high as US$332 million 
when in-stream sediment decreases are included. In addition, 
nitrogen leaching declined by 14 per cent, nitrogen run-off by 
13 per cent, phosphorus run-off by 15 per cent, soil productivity 
losses by more than 300 per cent, wind erosion by 21 per cent, 
carbon emissions by 7 per cent, pesticide leaching by 9 per cent, 
and pesticide run-off by 7 per cent (Cattaneo et al. 2005). The US 
Department of Agriculture has formed an Office of Environmental 
Markets (previously the Office of Ecosystem Services and Markets 
formed in 2008) to create guidelines for developing these kinds 
of market-based policies (USDA 2011).

In Canada, continuous direct payment programmes based on a 
multi-functionality approach remain uncommon. Some provinces 
are already using payment for ecosystem services to make it 
more attractive for farmers to maintain stream habitats, while at 
the national level efforts are under way to find approaches for 
comparing the value of services provided by forests (Anderson et 
al. 2010). The implementation of such schemes faces numerous 
methodological, political and ethical challenges as well as 
capacity, cost and time constraints, and their long-term impact 
is still unclear. In general, payment for ecosystem services needs 
to be complemented with land-use planning frameworks to be 
effective (Calbick et al. 2003).

One innovative and promising economic approach aims to 
reduce the financial risk of switching to more environmentally 
sound practices and does not necessarily involve any payment. 
For instance, in the Canadian province of Prince Edward Island, 
farmers were offered insurance against the perceived risk that 
reducing fertilizer use might also reduce yields. In the majority of 
cases, no payment was needed since reducing fertilizer use did 
not reduce yields: this was because fertilizer use was already so 
high that using less had little effect (Cheverie 2009). 

Command-and-control mechanisms
The use of public authority to preserve a given resource has 
a long and successful history. Changing private ownership 
to public or government ownership and a state-controlled 
protective regime can eliminate incentives to appropriate the 
benefits of overexploitation. Indeed, North America pioneered 
the establishment of the first national parks. This strategy 
presupposes extensive political and administrative enforcement 
of the status of these resources, which is more readily available 
in highly developed economies. Although its effectiveness 
remains to be seen, the Quebec Water Law of 2009, which 
considers water a common heritage of the Québécois nation, 

356

Part 2: Policy Options

is a recent and noteworthy example of this type of instrument 
(Government of Quebec 2009).

Command-and-control mechanisms are often preferred when 
there are significant threats to human health, when a specific 
requirement needs to be monitored and enforced, when 
absolutely no additional environmental harm is permitted, 
and when simplicity and consistency are desired. In practice, 
market-based and command-and-control style regulations 
are often combined to meet an environmental objective. The 
ban on leaded petrol in the United States, for example, was 
accompanied by a trading mechanism during the phase-out 
period so that refineries could meet the declining production 
allowance in a cost-effective manner. 

Although such instruments have become politically challenging 
to put together, particularly in the United States, there are 
several noteworthy examples of their successful use, such as 
standards for drinking water, clean air, toxic chemical releases 
and fuel; various types of prohibitions including on littering and 
the introduction of invasive alien species; and requirements 
on recycling, for example. Canada has the authority to regulate 
toxic substances, several fuels including diesel and petrol, and 
a number of fuel quality parameters, including sulphur levels. 
Greenhouse gas and air pollution regulations have also been 
implemented in Canada and the United States for new vehicles 
and engines. With regard to air quality control more generally, 
Canada monitors and regulates air pollutants through the 
Canadian Environmental Protection Act and has established 
National Ambient Air Quality Objectives, although air quality 
remains the primary responsibility of provinces. In the United 
States, the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standard 
regulates the fuel economy of new light-duty vehicles. 

One of the drawbacks of these instruments is their weak 
resilience. When regulations induce changes in behaviour, such 
as when penalties for failure to obey them are high enough,

these changes usually depend on the continuous enforcement 
of regulations. Many governments at various levels have tried 
to green their operations, but the results have often been 
disappointing and have remained limited as long as they were 
perceived as top-down mandates and did not change the 
incentive structure. However, the positive experience of the 
US Forest Service since 2008, which sought to instil not only a 
conservation ethic but also a consumption ethic by changing 
organizational incentives and promoting bottom-up efforts, is 
instructive in this regard (Jones-Crabtree et al. 2008). 

Accountability and transparency
Policy instruments designed to increase accountability and 
transparency seek to make information on environmental 
performance and the environmental impacts of resource use 
more widely available to facilitate decision making as well as 
mobilize a variety of stakeholders. Certainly the best known 
and most widely disseminated of these policy tools is the 
requirement for environmental impact assessments, which, when 
first included in the 1969 US National Environmental Policy Act, 
mandated preliminary interdisciplinary assessments of the likely 
environmental impacts of major federal projects (Hironaka 2002). 
It required US federal officials to include environmental values 
in a federal decision-making process dominated by technical 
and economic, if not political, considerations. An environmental 
impact assessment also requires the identification and evaluation 
of reasonable alternatives to a proposed federal action, as well 
as input from concerned stakeholders. Canada adopted its own 
act in 1992, following previous provincial initiatives. This has 
since evolved considerably, notably in terms of its target, which 
goes beyond federal and even publicly funded projects, but 
also in terms of its scope, with the introduction of sectoral and 
strategic assessments, and methods that include social variables. 
Although often criticized for its cost, the delays it can cause, and 
for ignoring the value of not doing anything at all (null decision), 
it remains one of the most effective tools for making sounder 
environmental decisions as well as improving participation.

The requirement to report on polluting emissions is another 
example of information dissemination that can become an 
effective policy tool. Canada has a National Pollutant Release 
Inventory and has implemented a Greenhouse Gas Emissions 
Reporting Program, while in the United States the EPA requires 
the reporting of greenhouse gas data and other relevant 
information from large sources and suppliers. This reporting 
is now required in 19 US states, and companies will need 
to report federally on their 2010 emissions in 2011. The US 
Toxics Release Inventory programme provides stakeholders 
with information about chemical releases for better decision 
making. The drawbacks of such instruments include the limited 
effectiveness of relying on blame-and-shame alone when 
inventory requirements are not tied to specific obligations. 
Thus, this instrument is best seen as a complement to market-
based or command-and-control approaches. 

Providing basic information on the environmental impact of 
individual citizen behaviour is another useful policy instrument.

endangered — stands on guard in the High Arctic. © Paul Loewen/iStock

The US EPA and Department of Energy instituted the EnergyStar 
labelling programme to recognize appliances that perform at or 
above category benchmarks for energy efficiency. It confers a 
simple efficiency label to a product, but not detailed information 
about its energy consumption or the anticipated operating 
costs. The benefits include its simplicity, which led to the rapid 
improvement of product efficiency by manufacturers who wanted 
to qualify for the EnergyStar label (Howarth et al. 2000).
In addition, the creation of third-party advisory bodies has 
proved useful in balancing the needs of science and politics, 
and provides a means of enhancing policy resilience, that is, 
the capacity of given policy objectives and means to persist in 
the face of external challenges. Nationally, the Committee on 
the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC), where 
federal and provincial bodies work together with private ones 
to diagnose problems and recommend action, has protected 
wildlife conservation from the vagaries of political cycles.

North America has also pioneered the institutionalization of 
public participation, which helps increase the likelihood of a 
policy’s implementation. Examples include the Great Lakes 
agreements (Box 13.5), the Commission for Environmental 
Cooperation’s process of citizen submission on enforcement 
matters, and environmental public hearings, as through 
Quebec’s Environmental Public Hearing Office. Specifically, 
Articles 14 and 15 of the North American Agreement on 
Environmental Cooperation (NAAEC) provide a non-adversarial 
process that allows citizens to file assertions that a Party of 
the NAAEC (Canada, Mexico or the United States) is failing to 
enforce its environmental law effectively. In some cases, this 
process can lead to a record. Political checks and declining 
funding for the Commission for Environmental Cooperation, 
which had held constant over the years, have however 
threatened its effectiveness. 

North America 357

A noteworthy development, reflecting a trend seen in other 
countries, has been the use of the Office of the Auditor General to 
evaluate and publicize the degree of implementation of national 
or sub-national commitments. Canada created a Commissioner 
of the Environment and Sustainable Development in 1995, and 
Quebec followed suit in 2006, with both enjoying a fair degree of 
autonomy. This role will be enhanced by the recent adoption of 
various sustainable development strategies, both at the federal 
and provincial/state levels, aiming to make environmental 
decision making more transparent and accountable. It is too 
early to assess effectiveness, however, and the lack of uniform 
sustainable development indicators hampers comparisons 
between the approaches adopted.

The acceptability, nature and effectiveness of various policy 
instruments depend on a number of internal and external 
factors that vary from state to state, province to province and 
region to region. In the end, successful policies rely on a mix of 
instruments and incentives. Although market approaches have 
raised considerable interest and have proved to be efficient in 
some cases, the enduring value of traditional command-and-
control regulation, associated with disclosure requirements, has 
been most effective in changing the behaviour of major polluters 
(Harrison and Antweiler 2003). 

Land use
One of the most important obstacles to sustainable land 
use in North America remains the fragmentary nature of land 
management. Forests, rangelands, croplands and urban, 
suburban and peri-urban lands are all part of the same landscape 
mosaic from which people derive survival and quality of life. 
Often, activities within one land type affect the state of others, as 
well as other ecosystem services such as air and water quality. 
Such impacts are often referred to as externalities, as the true 
costs and benefits of the impact are borne by parties external 
to the those who control and benefit from the activity. Even 
within a given land-use type, management responsibilities can 
be dispersed across several distinct bodies according to the 
type of activity taking place or to the component that is under 
consideration – water, fish and wildlife, fossil fuels or recreation, 
amongst others. In forest planning, for example, forestry, oil and 
gas, recreation, and the provision of ecosystem services are often 
managed by entirely separate bodies, even though all activities 
take place within the forest. 

In North America, many land-use policies are gaining support 
and are now considered to be highly effective in motivating 
sustainable land use. These policy options work in tandem, 
providing informational and functional support to achieve the 
desired goals. This section discusses three policy clusters that 
have been demonstrated in reality or suggested in theory to 
be the most promising to coordinate land management and 
promote sustainable resource use and social, economic and 
environmental harmonization in North America. These policy 
clusters are:
•	 implementing	integrated	land	management	plans	to	

encourage and enable sustainable resource use; 

•	 incorporating	the	true	costs	and	benefits	of	ecosystem	

services when developing policy mechanisms; and 

•	 improving	planning	for	and	sustainability	of	public	lands.

Implementing integrated land management plans
To speed up achievement of the international goal of sustainably 
developing and using land in North America, integrated 
planning is crucial, requiring policies with clear agreed goals 
and specific targets. Land-use policies need to be set at the 
appropriate geographic scale – state, province, county and 
city level – although watersheds or other ecologically relevant 
geographic scales may be the most logical units for determining 
a resource-use sustainability plan. Specific targets should 
be set to obtain the highest benefits for the least social and 
economic costs. Institutional barriers such as centralized yet 
fragmented governmental structures should be overcome to 
allow a regional emphasis, and stakeholders should be allowed 
to participate in spatial planning. Both regulatory and incentive-
based policies can be enacted to encourage target attainment. 
These policies should motivate individuals and corporations 
to act in accordance with the established plans. In addition, 
policies should be developed to encourage the resource sectors 
to maintain and enhance ecosystem resilience for future 
generations as well as limit the erosion of ecosystem services. 

Jurisdictions throughout North America have adopted many of 
these policy instruments, to different degrees. For example, in 
British Columbia, resource companies, environmental groups 
and coastal First Nations have successfully carried out an 
ecosystem-based integrated land-use planning exercise, the 
2006 Great Bear Forest Agreements, through a collaborative 
process (McGee et al. 2010), although the recent economic 
downturn has made financing participatory and multi-agency 
programmes more difficult for state/provincial and local 
governments. As fiscal issues may become more challenging 
in the near future, creative financing and regulatory measures 
coupled with financial incentives could become more important. 
At the same time, agencies will have more time to develop plans 
as the pace of industrial, commercial and housing development 
slows. Planning today may have long-reaching impacts as the 
economy returns to normal. 

States, provinces, counties and cities have taken action 
to encourage smarter land use through innovative policy 
mechanisms. These initiatives address many of the challenges 
related to an optimal land-use pattern while respecting property 
rights, the need for equity and low-income housing, employment 
concerns, resource protection and environmental issues. For 
example, in the United States, the State of Maryland uses a 
series of incentives in its Smart Growth programme (Box 13.3). 
The programme rewards people for relocating close to their place 
of employment, capitalizes on state money for infrastructure by 
providing it only within planned growth areas (priority funding 
areas), targets conservation funding to contiguous land and 
high-conservation-value land within clearly identified Rural 
Legacy areas, and subsidizes urban redevelopment through its 
brownfield redevelopment programme. Smart Growth focuses

on long-term regional considerations of sustainability, valuing 
community, public transport, employment and housing choices, 
preserving natural resources and promoting equity.

Similarly in Canada, the Province of Ontario has developed a 
greenbelt around the City of Toronto (Box 13.4) and protected 
open space and working lands from further conversion through 
zoning regulations. Agricultural retention can have economic, 
cultural and amenity benefits as well as environmental ones. 
British Columbia has designated an Agricultural Reserve, while 
Vancouver promotes development near its Sky Train stations. 
Rather than continue investments in roads and highways that 
promote an automobile culture, metropolitan areas like Toronto 
and Vancouver are focusing scarce investment on public transport 
and transit-oriented development with multiple benefits. 

Incorporating the value of ecosystem services in private 
sector decision making
Market mechanisms, financial incentives and regulatory 
approaches have moved people to adopt better land-use 
practices. However, policies intended to benefit society can have 
unintended consequences. They often require the conversion of 
forests, grasslands and wetlands to other uses, which results in 
loss of habitat and biodiversity, impaired water quality, increased 
flooding, eroded soils and loss of resource-based industries 
and employment. Governments can help diminish such 
environmental effects through a number of policy initiatives. The 
most efficient and least controversial remains the establishment 
of mechanisms through which users of an ecosystem service, 
such as water quality, who are willing to pay for the service, 
compensate land managers for implementing best management 
practices such as riparian buffers, reduced tillage and reduced 
fertilizer applications. Taxes and other incentives in the United 
States have increased the total area conserved by local, state 

and national land trusts to almost 15 million hectares. Payment 
for ecosystem service programmes, such as working lands 
(agricultural and forest) preservation programmes that bring 
together the various economic and ecological benefits that these 
lands provide to society, have permanently preserved another  
92 million hectares in the United States. 

Cap-and-trade systems, such as the one in place for wetlands in 
the United States (Spieles 2005), can also be established when 
the users of the ecosystem services are dispersed or even do 
not yet exist, as in the case of acting in the interests of future 
generations. Caps need to be established, as in the case of 
the policy of no net loss of wetlands in the US Clean Water Act, 
and the magnitude and nature of compensation needs to be 
determined. While requiring considerable resources of time and 
effort to establish and implement, the pay-off from a societal 
point of view is that the market is then able to determine the 
most efficient means of respecting the cap through a system of 
trading (Yamasaki et al. 2010; Salzman 2005). In the more 
than 500 wetlands mitigation banking schemes that generate  
US$3 billion dollars, and the more than 110 habitat banks 
generating US$370 million in the United States (Madsen et al. 
2010), land developers include the cost of wetland mitigation 
when pricing potential land acquisitions. They understand that 
purchasing land with wetlands will cost more in the end than land 
without them; either they protect the wetland or are required 
to restore wetlands elsewhere. Governments can implement 
programmes to encourage wetland restoration projects that 
developers can pay for and use to mitigate any wetlands 
destroyed in their own development projects. 

Where potential projects are too fragmented, as is often the 
case with conservation on working lands, and markets for 
environmental payments run the risk of remaining excessively

ecological integrity of riparian areas; habitat provision for 
plant and animal diversity and species conservation; multiple 
uses including recreation and industrial applications; public 
involvement in the planning process including community 
consultation and all levels of government entities; the use of 
the best available scientific information to inform the planning 
process; and the development of a more efficient and adaptive 
land management planning process (USDA 2012).

While the planning rule is being revised, some groups argue that, 
instead of a governmental planning approach to help the forest, 
some type of certification processes for land and management 
practices should be implemented. Examples of such processes 
include those used by non-governmental groups including the 
Forest Stewardship Council and the Marine Stewardship Council’s 
fisheries certification programme (Glickman 2008). Indeed, the 
province of Quebec’s revised Forest Act, which sets the stage 
for integrated land management with significantly increased 
responsibilities at the regional level, legislates for wood products 
from all public forests to be eco-certified by 2013.

Public-private partnerships have become increasingly important 
as current government funds and staffing are inadequate to 
assess resources, coordinate sustainable management, and 
accommodate the increasing demands of multiple users. Public-
private partnerships are difficult to foster unless sufficient 
motivation exists on all sides, as within federal agencies and 
among their staff, long-term traditions can be difficult to alter 
without appropriate changes to incentives and reward structures. 

Case studies on innovative land-use policies
The policies, underlying conditions and case studies presented 
here demonstrate that multiple policy instruments can speed up 
efforts to achieve the internationally agreed goal of implementing 
integrated land management and water-use plans to ensure the 
sustainable use of renewable resources (Johannesburg Plan 
of Implementation Paragraph 40b). In the case of the State of 
Maryland (Box 13.3), policies leveraged the state’s funds to 
encourage built infrastructure in planned priority areas while 
providing incentives to create new jobs and develop brownfield 
sites within the same areas. The planning process involved 
local communities and used incentives to encourage voluntary 
participation to achieve the plan’s goals, ensuring that it was 
politically palatable and thus likely to be successful. While 
encouraging development in and near cities, Maryland also 
protected valuable resource-rich land from conversion through 
permanent conservation easements. 

In the case of Ontario and British Columbia (Box 13.4), 
their governments passed regulatory measures to protect 
environmentally sensitive and working lands while encouraging 
transit-oriented development within the cities. From a policy 
perspective, environmentally sensitive and working lands are 
lumped together, and farming and environmental communities 
have joined forces on these issues – one of the reasons for 
so much support for conservation programmes. Conservation 
practices can be adopted to retain topsoil and prevent erosion

thin, governments can opt for more direct financial intervention, 
such as the Conservation Reserve Program in the United States 
(as mentioned in the section on market mechanisms, above), 
under which landowners enter into contracts with the government 
to implement best management or conservation practices to 
achieve environmental goals. 

Improving sustainability on public lands
In both Canada and the United States, which are endowed with 
diverse and abundant land resources, the government owns a 
substantial amount of that land: 89 per cent of the land mass 
in Canada and 35–40 per cent of it in the United States. While 
human capital in both countries remains a tremendous asset, 
many economic sectors continue to generate wealth through 
natural resource use. Therefore, federal government policies 
on its own land can have a large impact. 

In the United States, principles of multiple use and sustained 
yield dominated for many years, then in 1993 President Clinton 
established a goal of achieving sustainable forest management 
of all US forests by the year 2000. And in 1995, through the 
Montreal Process and the Santiago Declaration, the United States 
committed to a process of developing and evaluating national 
indicators of sustainable forest management. As a result, during 
the passage of the Federal Ecosystem Management Initiative, 
its emphasis shifted to ecosystem management with plans 
focused on long-term sustainability rather than on management 
to maximize short-term yield (Cortner and Moote 1999; Yaffee 
et al. 1996). However, planning has proven problematic 
and litigious, and recently, a revised planning rule has been 
proposed for the nation’s public lands. The latest planning rule 
under consideration stresses the restoration and maintenance 
of forests and grasslands; the protection of water quality and

Box 13.3 Maryland’s Smart Growth programme: financial incentives and planning

Maryland’s Smart Growth programme targets state resources 
to support development in areas where infrastructure already 
exists and to avoid the high cost of building infrastructure far 
from traditional population centres. Priority funding areas are 
identified within existing communities and other areas where 
local county and town governments want state investment to 
support growth and development (Sartori et al. 2011; Lewis 
et al. 2009). This approach capitalizes on the influence of 
state expenditure on economic growth and development. 
Development is more likely to occur in these planned areas, 
slowing the conversion of resource-rich land. 

In addition, Smart Growth helps protect valuable natural 
resources, purchasing land and easements in designated Rural 
Legacy areas that have been selected based on the extent of 
the development threat and the value of their agricultural, 
forestry and natural resources. These areas attract both 

Rural Legacy dollars and money from other preservation and 
conservation programmes (Lynch and Liu 2007), leading to 
more contiguous and environmentally beneficial preservation, 
including retention of interior forests (blocks of trees away 
from non-forest land or roads), wildlife habitat, groundwater 
recharge and wetland preservation, as well as agricultural and 
other productive resource use.

Three additional incentive programmes reward the 
redevelopment of brownfield sites (Howland 2010), 
businesses that create jobs in priority funding areas, and 
citizens who move to live near their place of work. Johns 
Hopkins University, for example, worked with Baltimore City 
and the State of Maryland to offer cash grants ranging from 
US$2 500 to US$17 000 to help university employees buy 
homes in targeted areas around its campuses (Wiewel and 
Knaap 2005).

on environmentally sensitive land; wetland protection can be 
implemented; and streams can be fenced and animals kept out. 
In many cases, agriculture-related programmes are relatively 
successful in achieving environmental protection because the 
opportunity costs to landowners are much lower than for land 
put to other uses. Programme developers have also come to 
understand that environmental attributes are often devalued 

Box 13.4 Canadian land-use reserves in Ontario and 
British Columbia: command and control

Ontario and British Columbia have protected rural and 
working lands surrounding major cities through regulatory 
measures. British Columbia established the Agricultural 
Land Reserve system, under which agriculture and 
forestry are the priority uses, and non-agricultural uses 
are controlled (Cavendish-Palmer 2008; Hanna 1997). 
The system covers approximately 4.7 million hectares. 
While it is criticized for not compensating farmland owners 
sufficiently for the alteration in rights, it has been defended 
on the grounds that it effectively provides food security and 
controls urban and peri-urban expansion.

The Ontario Greenbelt protects green space, farmland, 
forests, wetlands and watersheds around one of Canada’s 
most populated and rapidly growing areas (Ali 2008; Feung 
and Conway 2007; Taylor et al. 2005). It encompasses 
730 000 hectares in which limited agricultural uses are 
permitted, includes environmentally sensitive land and a 
major aquifer, and contains a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve, the 
Niagara Escarpment (Cavendish-Palmer 2008; Hanna 1997).

in land markets and have developed new compensation 
schemes with environmentally sensitive features that benefit 
landowners. While the use of financial incentives and subsidies 
differs from regulatory measures, all of these, alone and in 
combination, can play important roles in addressing land-use 
issues. Concerns about property rights should be evaluated and 
addressed. For each policy, decision makers should consider 
the implied property rights in the existing market structure and 
how a particular policy will alter this. Regardless of the policy 
path chosen, cultivating and developing widespread public 
support and a willingness to plan is essential to the success of 
any of these policies.

Cross-cutting issues
Implementing the selected land-use policies can provide a 
number of benefits to support the energy, freshwater and 
governance goals. Integrated land management may lead 
to policies that provide co-benefits, such as improving 
water availability and quality by reducing run-off. This form 
of planning may also help to identify areas that are most 
acceptable and best suited for the development of renewable 
energy, thereby decreasing uncertainty for projects and 
accelerating implementation. Integrated land management, if it 
leads to the maintenance of vegetation on a landscape, will also 
help attain international goals related to climate change.

Freshwater 
It is critical to the appropriate use and allocation of freshwater 
resources that policy instruments designed to meet basic 
human water needs, as well as water requirements for the 
production of food and energy, are balanced with the need to 
maintain other ecosystem services. Three clusters of key policy 
options identified for North America are integrated watershed 
management, full-cost pricing and technological solutions.

Integrated watershed management
Integrated watershed planning and management can be applied 
in combination with other water management measures and has 
become an indispensible instrument for improving water resources. 
It is an holistic approach to managing water within drainage areas. 
This approach is consistent with the broader concept of integrated 
water resources management discussed in Chapter 4 and aims to 
achieve optimal and sustainable water availability that will improve 
human quality of life while maintaining environmental integrity for 
all species. Integrated watershed planning and management has 
proved effective in addressing some complex challenges over the 
last few decades (Heathcote 2009). The method recognizes that 
water issues cannot be addressed independently but require the 
balanced consideration of all environmental, social, economic and 
technical aspects. It may include goals such as flood prevention, 
enhancement of aquatic habitat and biodiversity, reduction in the 
loss and degradation of wetlands, pollution control and economic 
growth. The success of programmes can be assessed through water 
quality indicators including contaminant concentration, dissolved 
oxygen and biodiversity, water flow and flood prevention. 

Developing and implementing an integrated watershed planning 
and management policy requires active participation, interaction 
and collaboration between stakeholders. Currently, this is not 
administered nationally in the United States and Canada, but 
through initiatives at the regional or state/provincial level. For 
example, the Total Maximum Daily Loads programme for pollutant 
control in the United States is being implemented at the state 
level as required by the Clean Water Act. States are required to 
identify impaired waters and calculate the maximum amount of 
a pollutant a water body can receive and still meet water quality 
standards, and then develop plans, with public input, to address 
point and non-point sources of pollutants in an effort to restore 
and maintain the water quality. Although the programme has 
shown a varying degree of success across the country – due in 
part to the differences of each watershed – factors that have 
been recognized to enhance implementation include a focused 
watershed plan, active stakeholder involvement, coordination 
between local and state governments, a diversity of approaches 
to addressing sources of pollution, and adequate resources 
for watershed characterization and monitoring (Benham et al. 
2008). An attractive aspect of integrated watershed planning and 
management is that it need not require expensive infrastructure 
such as water treatment and control structures. Therefore, costs 
do not necessarily restrict implementation, so it can move 
forward in situations and regions where financial resources 
are limited. This makes integrated watershed planning and 
management highly transferable, provided effective coordination 
and implementation mechanisms can be established. It can 
also be applied at a diversity of scales ranging from small urban 
stream restoration projects to large watershed programmes, such 
as the Great Lakes (Box 13.5), Chesapeake Bay (Hassett et al. 
2005), the Everglades (Davis and Ogden 1994) and San Francisco 
Bay (IRWMP 2006). Of its many benefits, perhaps the most 
notable is that stakeholders are actively involved in selecting 
the management strategies to solve water resource problems. 
Active stakeholder involvement, with explicit discussion of 

362

Part 2: Policy Options

issues, improves decision making and acceptance, thus offering 
advantages over top-down planning, which often lacks public 
support and understanding. 

Integrated watershed planning and management is not without 
problems, however, and it is often difficult to determine how 
well it works. In the Chesapeake Bay watershed, it was initiated 
decades ago in an effort to clean up the estuary and restore 
coastal fisheries. Projects to improve water quality have largely 
focused on tributaries, and include re-vegetating riparian 
areas, improving stream channels and restoring wetlands. 
Millions of dollars have been spent on thousands of restoration 
projects within the watershed, yet the success is difficult to 
gauge, due in part to a lack of comprehensive monitoring of 
individual projects (Hassett et al. 2005). While clear indications 
of widespread water quality improvements in the Chesapeake 
Bay have not yet been observed, outcomes in some areas look 
promising (Ruhl and Rybicki 2010).

In general, integrated watershed planning and management 
faces serious challenges due largely to the magnitude and 
complexity of problems as well as socio-political rather than 
technological or hydrological barriers. The mismatch between 
watershed boundaries and political boundaries poses a 
challenge because of the often conflicting needs of the multiple 
landowners and political entities with jurisdictions in watersheds 
(Blomquist and Schlager 2005). To overcome this, a watershed 
authority is typically established to coordinate and implement 
the plan, and faces the formidable task of bringing together the 
stakeholders and facilitating agreements to balance the needs of 
competing interests. Thus, collaboration and public participation 
are essential. The challenges of creating watershed authorities 
are magnified when watersheds cross international boundaries. 
However, these challenges can be met through such efforts as 
the International Watersheds Initiative, which was conceived by

Box 13.5 Protection and management of the Great Lakes Basin

Canada and the United States share the benefits and responsibility 
of co-managing the Great Lakes watershed ecosystem, the 
Earth’s largest surface freshwater system (GLIN 2011a)  
(Figure 13.1). In addition to providing drinking water to nearly 
33 million people, this abundant supply of water is at the core of 
the region’s economy. The Great Lakes–St Lawrence River Basin 
Sustainable Water Resources Agreement of 2005, signed by eight 
American states and two Canadian provinces, provides a framework 
for each state and province to manage and protect the basin as a 
whole. The agreement’s principles stem from an ecosystem-based 
water management approach and include bans on new diversions 
of water from the basin, with a few exceptions; imposes a consistent 
standard to review proposed uses of basin water; requires that each 
state and province develop and implement a water conservation 
and efficiency programme; strengthens the collection and sharing of 
technical data among parties; and ensures a strong commitment to 
continued public involvement in implementing the agreement.

The Great Lakes and St Lawrence Cities Initiative is an 
example of a successful cross-jurisdictional initiative that 
has been effective in increasing water efficiency and reducing 
demand across the region. The initiative includes the 
objective that, by 2015, all participating cities of the basin 
reduce water use by 15 per cent relative to levels of use in 
2000. By 2010, almost half of the 33 participating cities had 
collectively achieved a 13 per cent reduction, conserving 
around 330 million m3 of water. Policy instruments that 
helped achieve this reduction include: 
•	 technological	instruments	such	as	infrastructure	upkeep	

and water metering;

•	 economic	incentives	such	as	subsidies	that	promote	water	

efficiency, and reduced water rates for industrial users 
based on their commitment to implement sustainable 
water-saving projects; and 

•	 educational	outreach	(GLSL	Cities	2011).

the governments of Canada and the United States to promote the 
establishment of watershed authorities and facilitate integrated 
transboundary management (Blaney 2009). 

Full-cost pricing
Full-cost pricing of water delivery has been defined by the US EPA 
as “a pricing structure which fully recovers the cost of providing 
that service in an economically efficient, environmentally 

sound, and socially acceptable manner, and which promotes 
efficient water use by customers” (USEPA 2006). Based on 
the user-pays and polluter-pays principles, high-volume users 
pay proportionately more than low-volume users. The aim is to 
make it possible for all consumers to afford the volume of water 
necessary for basic human needs while charging increasing 
prices for consumption beyond that level. Full costs include all 
public and private costs, both market and non-market values, 
and account for costs that will be incurred in the future, such as 
those arising from infrastructure rehabilitation and replacement. 
In public water provision, once the water delivery infrastructure is 
in place – such as dams, canals, pumps, pipelines or treatment 
plants – the marginal cost to the utility company of delivering 
water to its customers is equal to its variable costs. These costs 
amount primarily to administrative and maintenance costs, 
which are near zero compared to the cost of establishing the 
overall infrastructure. The resulting artificially low market price to 
customers generally leads to water consumption decisions being 
based on incomplete information, resulting in overconsumption. 
In a full-cost pricing model, all infrastructural, environmental 
and intergenerational costs are included in the delivery price. In 
practice it is difficult to account for all of these costs accurately; 
nonetheless, various pricing systems attempt to convey more 
complete cost information so as to require consumers to pay 
more of the costs associated with their respective levels of 
water consumption. One example of how full-cost pricing can be 
implemented is through increasing block rates, thought to be 
the most effective in encouraging conservation. In this pricing 
structure, the amount charged per unit of water consumed 
increases with the total volume consumed. 

Numerous examples of successful implementation of full-cost 
pricing exist, and are typically evaluated in terms of reductions 
in water consumption (USEPA 2005). An example is offered by 

North America 363

the Marin Municipal Water District (MMWD), a public agency 
that provides water for 195 000 residents in south and central 
Marin County, California (MMWD 2011). The MMWD’s water rate 
structure includes a base fee that covers such services as meter 
reading, billing, meter replacement and repair, customer service, 
water conservation and administration, and four levels of charge 
that cover the cost of water transmission, treatment, distribution, 
watershed maintenance, and importing and recycling water. The 
MMWD imports a quarter of its water from the Russian River in 
Sonoma County through an agreement with the Sonoma County 
Water Agency. The environmental costs of using water from the 
Russian River stem from the Federal Endangered Species Act, 
and include expenses related to improving conditions for several 
fish species that are classified as threatened or endangered, 
for example by constructing fish ladders, as well as channel 
maintenance and monitoring. The MMWD is unusual in that 
customers pay the full cost of water without state and federal 
subsidies or cost sharing with other water agencies. Rates are 
comparable to other northern California water agencies, and 
overall water use has remained relatively stable over the 
last several decades despite an increasing population (Fryer 
2009). These water-saving measures are a result of a better

understanding of the true value of water, and have minimized  
the financial and environmental costs of water supply expansion.

Despite successes, there are also some limitations to full-cost 
pricing, including its complexity compared to the simplicity of 
traditional marginal-cost pricing structures, making it difficult for 
consumers to respond to the price information by adjusting their 
water use. Public outreach campaigns and in-bill information 
leaflets that describe cost structures are addressing this barrier 
to some extent. Another limitation is the difficultly in setting 
prices properly, in particular in identifying and allocating 
non-market costs such as environmental losses associated 
with water delivery – for example the environmental effects of 
constructing new diversion and containment structures. Various 
formal methods have been developed, however, for assigning 
market values to non-market costs over time, identifying present 
and amortized values for those costs, and then adding them to 
the marginal cost to customers on the basis of water consumed 
(Renzetti and Kushner 2004; Rogers et al. 2002). Implementing 
full-cost pricing requires adequate institutional support and 
agreement, as well as the personnel and data necessary for 
estimating cost components. 

Technological solutions and conservation measures
Technological advances and conservation measures can 
effectively decrease water use in the residential, industrial and 
agricultural sectors. This has been accomplished in large part 
through regulation, financial incentives and voluntary measures. 
Many options are available for reducing water consumption and 
increasing efficiency depending on the sector, including low-tech 
solutions, water-saving appliances, water reuse systems and 
metering. For example, the decline in average residential water 
use in North America over the last 25 years is largely attributed 
to increased efficiency standards for household appliances 
(Rockaway et al. 2011). In the agricultural sector, flood irrigation 
systems are being replaced by more efficient technologies 
designed to increase crop yield per unit of water use. Simpler 
conservation measures such as responsible water-use habits 
go hand-in-hand with efficiency, and can be promoted through 
water education programmes. Examples of cities that have 
implemented such programmes include El Paso, Texas (EPWU 
2007), San Diego, California (City of San Diego 2011) and Prince 
George, British Columbia (City of Prince George 2011).

Conserving water through improved long-term sustainable 
efficiency can lead to a range of economic and environmental 
benefits. Some of the advantages of this approach include 
adaptability to site-specific needs, avoidance of more expensive 
potable water supplies, and the reduced costs of operating and 
maintaining water distribution and treatment infrastructure, with 
associated energy savings. For commercial and industrial facilities, 
savings in water and energy costs realized by implementing 
efficiency measures can quickly offset the investments made. 
For instance, in the State of California the average estimated 
payback period for investing in water-efficient technologies in the 
commercial, industrial and institutional sector is typically less than 
two and a half years (Vickers 2001). Obstacles to implementing 

water efficiency measures include situations in which the capital 
investment does not justify the water cost savings in the short 
term, or when a general consensus cannot be reached among 
stakeholders that the benefits accrued to the water rate payers 
are worth the investment in the long run. Decisions often depend 
on the costs associated with water use and water discharge, 
environmental compliance and production. Other economic 
incentives may be required in some areas with low water costs, 
including subsidies, tax credits and grants. In many cases, it will 
be a combination of sector-specific instruments and incentives 
appropriate to a region’s issues and needs that will allow a 
variety of innovative and effective water-use efficiency measures 
to be implemented.

Cross-cutting issues
Policies that promote the integrity of the water cycle and the 
essential life-supporting services it provides can indirectly 
help achieve the internationally agreed goals for land use and 
renewable energy. Successful implementation of integrated 
watershed planning and management is likely to promote 
sustainable land use by restoring ecosystem function and 
enhancing resilience. When the true cost of water supply is 
assessed, added revenue may be used to fund restoration 
programmes carried out over the landscape. Water conservation 
that stems from financial incentives and technological advances 
will further reduce land degradation and minimize energy 
requirements for the use and distribution of water. Greater 
reliance on renewable energy sources will reduce greenhouse 
gas emissions that cause climate change, which may mitigate 
projected impacts on the water cycle.

Energy 
Canada and the United States are endowed with diverse and 
abundant renewable energy resources. Transforming that vast 
potential into a sustainable energy system requires mobilizing 
political will, behavioural change and smart, comprehensive policies 
that support renewable energy. There are several environmental 
issues associated with the current energy system, including climate 
change, elevated water consumption and air pollution. 

Since fossil fuel consumption is the major contributor to 
increasing atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide 
(CO2), experts contend that policy interventions should be 
strengthened, not just to increase renewable energy production, 
but to substitute renewable energy for the current carbon-
emitting energy systems (Delucchi and Jacobson 2011; IPCC 
2011; Jacobson and Delucchi 2011; Schneider et al. 2000). 
Renewable electricity technologies offer an effective means 
of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, thus providing a tool 
for climate change mitigation (Awerbuch 2006). This section 
highlights practical lessons learned as well as comprehensive 
and emerging novel approaches from North America’s electricity 
sector. It has become clear that even partial mitigation of the rate 
of climate change requires more carbon-free sources of electricity 
(Schiermeier et al. 2008). In addition, policy innovation and 
technical improvements are rapidly advancing in this sector,  
thus providing the clearest examples for emulation.

North America’s current dependence on fossil fuel resources 
largely stems from a cycle of pricing effects, partially due to 
subsidies that favour conventional fossil fuel energy production 
and that externalize pollution costs. For example, an analysis 
of all energy subsidies provided in the United States in 2004 
shows that 86 per cent went to fossil fuels, 8 per cent to nuclear 
energy and just 6 per cent to renewables and energy efficiency 
(Sovacool and Watts 2009). Recently, Energy Secretary Steven 
Chu announced that the Obama administration intends to 
repeal US$46.2 billion in subsidies to oil, natural gas and coal 
companies in the next ten years in order to fund renewable 
energy spending (Bloomberg 2011). Economists argue that 
to address these uneven subsidies and other market failures 
associated with fossil fuels and to accelerate renewable energy 
deployment, the multiple social and environmental costs of 
emissions have to be included in the price of conventional energy 
production (Sovacool 2009a). Smart, novel and comprehensive 
policies are therefore necessary to provide the incentives, 
transmission networks, transparency and market space essential 
to support rapid and sustained renewable energy development 
and the substitution of fossil fuels.

During the selection process, three policy clusters were identified 
affecting renewable energy adoption: providing financial support 
to alter incentives or encourage behavioural change; improving 
networks and grid flexibility; and decreasing institutional 
barriers. This section highlights key policies that support current 
instruments affecting the adoption of renewable energy and 
discusses the benefits, drawbacks and potential for transfer 
and scale-up. However, as experts contend and the case studies 
in this section illustrate, a comprehensive policy approach is 
important when considering renewable energy support (Sovacool 
2009b). Such an approach could accelerate renewable energy 
development by simultaneously confronting the multiple 

North America 365

challenges and barriers that are delaying the transition to a 
sustainable energy system.

Support to alter incentives or encourage behavioural change 
The policy measures described in this section provide market 
incentives that partially address fossil fuel subsidies and the 
externalization of the costs of pollution (Sovacool and Watts 
2009). Examples already in use in North America include 
production tax credits, feed-in tariffs and renewable portfolio 
standards; in addition, governments supply funding for research 
and development. Production tax credits represent kilowatt-
hour tax credits for qualified renewable energy sources while 
feed-in tariffs typically guarantee grid access and provide 
long-term contracts for electricity generation at stable prices 
(DSIRE 2011; Mendonca 2007). Where they are well designed, 
feed-in tariffs also provide renewable energy premiums using 
the rate-payer base rather than government funds. Renewable 
portfolio standard policies also avoid the use of government 
funds, with the exception of monitoring compliance with the 
standard, and typically require utilities to procure renewable 
energy resources as a prescribed percentage of total electricity 
(Fischer 2010). Investments in research and development help 
to improve technologies that drive prices down, providing market 
advantages aimed at increasing the renewable energy market. 
The close coupling of research and development with investment 
subsidies has shown to improve policy effectiveness (Soderholm 
and Klaassen 2007; Klaassen et al. 2005).

Improving networks and grid flexibility
Renewable energy sources and current fossil fuel generation 
facilities are often located in different places, thus requiring 
networks to transport energy from new source areas to load 
centres. In addition, fossil fuel generation, which is characterized 
by long-term capital stock, currently dominates the market, 
limiting opportunities for new technologies to enter. Several 
policy measures have been devised that improve the management 
and characteristics of transmission networks and increase market 
access and space. These include designating transmission cost 
recovery and allocation; managing the grid through independent 
system operators; developing smart grids; and phasing out coal 
plants. These policies are intended to make it easier to develop 
infrastructure, open market space and transmit renewable energy 
from areas of generation to load centres. 

Cost recovery and allocation policies provide clear frameworks 
for developers to recover installation costs from transmission 
projects, which is necessary to provide an energy transportation 
network to increase renewable energy use. Currently, it is difficult 
to finance the development of transmission structures that cross 
multiple state and provincial jurisdictions, with, in many cases, 
associated problems in assigning costs and benefit levels. To 
overcome this, experts have proposed that federal authorities 
should determine cost allocation (Willrich 2009). 

Energy developers also encounter problems with the lack of 
transparency and access to the grid (Sovacool 2009b) as, 
traditionally, vertically integrated companies generate, transmit 

and distribute electricity. In many areas, utility companies still 
own and operate the transmission assets, leading to a lack of 
transparency in the availability of transmission. Independent 
system operators are third-party public institutions responsible 
for granting access to transmission grids, which could provide 
desirable conditions for accelerating renewable energy 
deployment by ensuring transparency and fair access to markets 
(Joskow 2005). In Texas, where cost allocations are assigned 
to all supply entities, representing a novel approach for North 
America (Schumacher et al. 2010), the construction of high-
voltage electricity transmission is proceeding rapidly (Box 13.6).

Phasing out coal plants is a relatively new policy instrument 
that decreases greenhouse gas emissions while simultaneously 
increasing grid flexibility and providing market space for 
renewable energy. Since coal-fired technology has a limited 
ability to respond to load fluctuations, these policies typically 
substitute coal-fired generation with natural gas, which has more 
responsive technologies that emit lower levels of pollutants 
and greenhouse gases than coal-fired generation (Dewees 
2008). Coal phase-out policies provide public health benefits 
and accelerate the transition to a sustainable energy system by 
decreasing emissions that lead to climate change (Winfield et al. 
2010). This particular policy rapidly internalizes the costs 
associated with the market failure of fossil fuel energy by 
targeting concentrated sources of emissions.

Policies for overcoming institutional barriers 
The final cluster consists of policies that increase the pace 
of renewable energy deployment by removing institutional 
barriers and facilitating long-term planning. One method of 
removing barriers is by consolidating siting authorities, either by 
aggregating multiple jurisdictions into one decision-making body 
or by placing the siting authority in an existing entity; examples 
are the Province of Ontario (Box 13.2) and the State of Texas 
(Box 13.6) (Gallant and Fox 2011; Bohn and Lant 2009; Wilson 
and Stephens 2009). 

Agencies may also conduct integrated resource planning, 
which typically requires involving the public, identifying 
energy efficiency and resource options, developing action 
plans, and describing efforts to minimize the environmental 
effects of resource acquisitions. Experts contend that plans for 
designing and optimizing systems should now include explicit 
consideration of grid-connected renewables. They also maintain 
that including the evaluation of renewable energy sources in 
integrated resource planning helps develop a cost-effective 
sustainable energy system (Yilmaz et al. 2008). 
 
Benefits of the selected policy measures
Empirical evidence shows that widespread renewable energy 
results in decreased environmental impacts and increased 
social benefits (IPCC 2011). Thus, increasing renewable energy 
production and displacing fossil fuels in the energy system by 
addressing perverse subsidies, providing paths to markets and 
market space, and removing institutional barriers could deliver 
multiple benefits. Environmental benefits include reduced 

366

Part 2: Policy Options

greenhouse gas emissions and air pollutants, lower water use 
in the case of wind and solar photovoltaics, and decreased 
water pollution (Sovacool and Watts 2009; Roth and Ambs 
2004). Social benefits include enhanced energy security and 
reliability by diversifying the supply and using indigenous 
resources, and reduced energy price volatility and disruptions 
(Awerbuch 2006; Roth and Ambs 2004). In addition, experts 
maintain that renewable energy developments are associated 
with enhanced economic development and more jobs (IPCC 
2011; Wei et al. 2010). Finally, the use of renewable resources 
also benefits public health through decreased emissions and 
fewer occupational injuries (Sumner and Layde 2009; Rabl and 
Spadaro 2000).

Research clearly demonstrates that renewable energy sources 
generate significantly lower greenhouse gas emissions than fossil 
fuel options (IPCC 2011; Awerbuch 2006). Scenario analyses 
indicate that increasing renewable energy deployment from 
27 to 77 per cent of the primary energy supply by 2050 may be 
expected and may achieve savings of up to 85 per cent of global 
CO2 emissions for the scenarios with the highest renewable 
energy shares (IPCC 2011). The majority of the technologies 
deployed in these scenarios are wind, direct solar and modern 
biomass, with an annual average cost of less than 1 per cent 
of global gross domestic product (GDP) per year (Edenhofer 
et al. 2011). Furthermore, experts forecast that by 2030 the 
production costs, including social costs, of renewable energy 
would be lower than energy production by fossil fuels (Delucchi 
and Jacobson 2011; Jacobson and and Delucchi 2011). However, 
to achieve this transition, existing policies must be significantly 
strengthened and implemented comprehensively and therefore 
require additional political will (Jacobson and Delucchi 2011; 
Sovacool and Watts 2009).

The benefits of improving networks and reducing institutional 
barriers include lower costs and faster deployment of renewable 
energy. In the case of transmission, improved networks generally 
enhance reliability, lower the delivered costs of electricity and 
restrict the ability of generators to exercise market power (Hirst 
2004). Experts commonly call for reducing institutional barriers to 
expedite the transition to a sustainable energy system (Mitchell 
et al. 2011). Quantitative analysis also shows that reducing 
siting barriers correlates with increased wind power development 
(Bohn and Lant 2009).

subsidies aimed at a particular industry (Berry and Jaccard 
2001). Inadequately designed renewable portfolio standards 
may encourage particular technologies and therefore lead to 
technological lock-ins (Unger and Ahlgren 2005). 

In addition, critics argue that implementing renewable energy 
policies may increase the cost of energy and/or increase tax 
burdens (Gallant and Fox 2011). These expenses are especially 
burdensome to lower-income households; however, widespread 
renewable energy adoption combined with progressive tax 
design and incentives offers some protection from energy price 
increases. For example, subsidy programmes already exist to 
assist low-income households with energy costs in the United 
States, so expanding existing programmes could provide 
assistance for vulnerable groups should energy prices rise. 

Policies to increase transmission networks and reduce siting 
barriers also have potential drawbacks. When reallocating 
the costs of transmission, these policies could result in 
disproportionate financial burdens on parties who do not benefit. 
Reducing siting barriers may also decrease public participation.

Potential drawbacks of selected policy measures
The successful implementation of production tax credits or 
feed-in tariffs requires an in-depth understanding of the various 
energy prices for all renewable energy sources as well as the 
costs of externalities. These policies therefore have potential 
drawbacks. Specifically, production tax credits or feed-in tariffs 
can be extremely inefficient. Since incentive levels are fixed over 
time, this may lead to limited innovation and downward price 
pressures. Likewise, implementing renewable portfolio standards 
also requires an in-depth knowledge of markets to establish 
appropriate targets, enforcement mechanisms and sector-
specific set-asides. While context dependent, these are usually 

Replication and transferability of selected policies
The potential for replication and transferability of these 
policies is not straightforward and is arguably dependent on 
context and specific instrument design. For example, the North 
American grid exists in an institutional framework that is highly 
fragmented, while other countries may have nationally owned 
networks, in which case fragmentation may not be an issue 
(Willrich 2009; Joskow 2005). Germany, France, Italy, Japan 
and Denmark have experience in replicating and transfering 
feed-in tariffs at the national level, while the United States 
and Australia have experience with production tax credits and 
renewable portfolio standards (IEA 2011). Policies on feed-in 

North America 367

tariffs and renewable portfolio standards are in force in diverse 
jurisdictions including Canada, China, Kenya, Portugal and 
Uganda (IEA 2011). Statistically, correlations demonstrate that 
the policies are effective, particularly in the case of feed-in 
tariffs (Haas et al. 2011). Direct causal evidence of effectiveness 
for other policies, however, is limited, as is evidence of the 

potential for replication and transferability to other jurisdictions 
(Carley 2009; Doris et al. 2009).

Proactive measures to accelerate the use of renewable energy
Achieving the international goal of urgently expanding the 
share of renewable energy supply in North America’s energy mix 

Box 13.6 Texas: a rapid expansion of wind energy

Texas has emerged as the leader in the growth of wind 
energy in the United States, with policies that direct market 
mechanisms towards achieving the state’s energy capacity 
goals. Policies include customer choice, wholesale electricity 
markets, and a transmission cost allocation method along 
with tradable renewable energy credits and federal tax credits 
(Zarnikau 2011). In addition to these policies, the authority for 
siting wind farms in Texas is centralized, making it relatively 
easy to obtain licenses compared to other areas of the country 
(Bohn and Lant 2009; Wilson and Stephens 2009). 

Expanding electricity transmission facilities has been a key 
component of Texas’s package of policy instruments. The 
state is an unusual jurisdiction in North America because 
it has a single grid authority, the Electric Reliability Council 

of Texas (ERCOT). As part of its transmission policies, Texas 
dispensed with the demonstration of a need and designated 
Competitive Renewable Energy Zones, thus allowing capacity 
to be built ahead of need. Texas also allocates costs for 
these facilities across all companies that provide electric 
power to consumers within the ERCOT area (Schumacher 
et al. 2010), allowing transmission developers to recover 
the costs from the installation of new power lines. In 
addition, the charging of all consumers and not just the 
beneficiaries provides a consistent framework across the 
entire grid, eliminating the political dispute over who pays 
and who benefits from new transmission. These policies, 
which actively plan for expanding transmission, have been 
vital in promoting the state’s rapid growth in renewable 
energy production (Figure 13.2).

Texas’s comprehensive policy package – which mandates renewable energy production, consolidates the siting authority and spreads 
transmission costs across all consumers – is a novel approach that has provided impressive results. Wind power deployment has grown 
from a capacity of 50 megawatts in 1999 to more than 9 272 megawatts in early 2010, accounting for 8.4 per cent of the state’s total 
electrical generation in the first quarter of 2010. While there have been challenges in grid integration and additional transmission 
expansion is currently under way, projections based on the current policies indicate that Texas’s wind energy will continue to expand 
and that solar energy deployment is expected to boom. The achievements and forecasts indicate that if the policy regime is properly 
designed, market-based initiatives can realize significant and rapid renewable energy development (Zarnikau 2011). 

368

Part 2: Policy Options

requires mobilizing political will and increasing public support 
to implement comprehensive renewable energy policies focused 
on addressing market failures, providing clear market signals, 
modernizing transmission systems, proving new technologies 
including energy storage, and streamlining institutional 
structures. A modernized, clean, reliable and efficient 21st 
century energy system will provide greater energy security, 
enhanced price stability and increased economic performance, 
and may save up to 85 per cent of global greenhouse gas 
emissions by 2050 (IPCC 2011; Awerbuch 2006). 

Current research argues that in accounting for fossil fuel 
externalities and subsidies, the question appears not to be 
one of cost, but rather of social and political barriers (Delucchi 
and Jacobson 2011). Cultivating and developing widespread 
public participation and support is essential for generating the 
political will to implement the policies necessary to achieve 
the internationally agreed goal. The case studies illustrate that 
comprehensive policy packages that include incentives to offset 
externality and subsidy advantages afforded to fossil fuels, 
provide for energy transmission and reduce institutional barriers, 
can also significantly accelerate the transition to a sustainable 
energy future.

Cross-cutting issues
Increasing the deployment of renewable energy can provide a 
number of benefits to support the other internationally agreed 
goals. Wind and solar photovoltaic renewable energy can 
decrease water stress since it uses less water than conventional 
thermo-electric forms of generation (Roth and Ambs 2004). 
Benefits for land use include relative reductions in greenhouse 
gas emissions, thereby decreasing potential climate change 
impacts (Turney and Fthenakis 2011). However, land use 
for expanding renewable energy systems may require the 
disturbance of additional areas, depending on the particular 
technology being deployed (Fthenakis and Kim 2009). At the 
same time, an integrated approach to siting renewable energy, 
increased transparency and collaboration between agencies may 
lead to improvements in environmental governance.

CONCLUSIONS
This chapter has suggested that there are many policies and 
market instruments that have contributed, however uncertain 
the causality, towards achieving the internationally agreed 
goals. It is unlikely the policies were instituted with the global 
goals in mind, however; rather, the impetus probably came 
from bi-national, national and sub-regional institutions and 
governing bodies. It is important for all levels of governance 
and decision making to set clear short-, medium- and long-term 
environmental goals and specific targets as a crucial means of 
inducing a change in behaviour among public and private actors. 
Performance indicators are necessary to evaluate policy progress 
and clearly identify successes and shortcomings, and it is also 
essential to work towards synergy between the goals adopted 
under climate change and other environmental themes, while 
keeping in mind the potential contradictions between different 
environmental goals – at least in the short term, for example in 

Yosemite, one of the largest and least fragmented habitat blocks in 
the Sierra Nevada, was central to the development of the national park 
concept in the United States. © Pgiam/iStock

the case of clean air and climate change – as well as between 
environmental protection and sustainable development, where 
conservation issues can arise. 

Some of the policy examples show how cultivating public will 
and political support while reducing negative public perceptions 
has moved the region closer to achieving environmental goals. 
Public-private partnerships have become increasingly important 
as government funds and staff have shown to be unable to 
assess resources, coordinate sustainable management and 
accommodate the increasing demands of multiple users. 

The selected policy options suggest a number of opportunities 
for future environmental governance in North America. The 
most efficient and least controversial financial mechanism for 
ecosystem services focuses on users of an ecosystem service 
– such as water quality – who are willing to pay for the service 
and compensate the owners or managers of that resource for 
implementing best management practices.

Finally, and importantly, the examples reveal that applying 
successful policy options is complex, often requiring hybrid 
techniques combining two or more regulatory mechanisms to 
adjust existing market rules, financial incentives to shift pricing 
in existing markets, and participatory techniques. Transferring 
and up-scaling the processes that appear to have contributed to 
the success of a policy or market instrument will further speed 
up the achievement of internationally agreed environmental 
goals. In general, transferring processes is more feasible than 
replicating policy contents, since more is known about factors 
that influence the likelihood of transfers. The success of policies 
and instruments is very context dependent, while processes 
foster legitimacy and learning. Failing to protect ecosystem 
services for the generations to come will undoubtedly be more 
costly – socially, economically and environmentally – than the 
burden of expanding processes and policies that seem already to 
have proven successful.

Main Messages 

Initiatives to introduce policy mixes to achieve a 
higher level of integration at different sectoral levels 
remain modest. West Asia has, however, made some 
progress on environmental governance and tends to 
rely on command-and-control measures rather than 
market-based instruments.

Financial investment has enabled some countries 
to make good progress towards Millennium 
Development Goal targets for water supply and 
sanitation (MDG 7c), but more efforts are still 
needed, especially in Yemen. In the past four 
decades, water policies have focused on supply 
infrastructure, especially in urban areas, aiming  
to overcome shortages through technical solutions 
including desalination. Coordination with other 
policies that prioritize balancing water supply 
with demand is crucial. The success of water 
policies in the region is contingent on political, 
financial and human commitment, reliable 
assessment of supply and demand, effective legal 
and institutional arrangements and active public-
private sector partnerships.

National action plans to combat land degradation 
and desertification should be integrated with the 
sustainable use of natural resources, biodiversity 
conservation and plans to reduce the impacts of 

climate change. Integrated action to reduce land 
degradation, a significant issue in the region, would 
also address the regional phenomena of dust storms.

The region needs to strengthen its legislative and 
institutional frameworks for developing sustainable 
energy systems if it is to achieve global goals. 
Policy development to promote energy efficiency 
and renewable energy is evolving but, despite a 
wealth of renewable energy sources, the energy 
sector is still characterized by heavy reliance on 
fossil fuels, leading to high carbon emissions 
and adverse environmental impacts. The building 
sector is a major energy consumer, especially for 
air-conditioning, though green building practices 
are now emerging through the adoption of industry 
energy-efficiency codes.

Countries should confirm their commitments to 
protect the coastal and marine ecosystem through 
harmonization of the ecosystem approach with 
integrated coastal zone management plans 
and strategies. Strong coastal development 
plans reflect the implementation of coastal and 
marine policies in West Asia. Achieving marine 
biodiversity conservation is progressing through the 
establishment of marine protected areas and the 
application of integrated fisheries management.

INTRODUCTION
West Asia is geographically grouped into two sub-regions: the 
Arabian Peninsula, including Yemen and the Gulf Cooperation 
Council (GCC) countries of Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi 
Arabia and United Arab Emirates; and the Mashriq, which 
includes Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, the Occupied Palestinian 
Territories (OPT) and Syria. The region covers about 4 million 
km2 approaching 2.5 per cent of world’s total land area. The 
environment is predominantly arid and semi-arid. Rainfall is 
scarce but with significant spatial and temporal variability. 
Water scarcity and frequent and persistent spells of drought are 
common, making water the region’s most precious resource.

The region faces major environmental challenges in the need to 
address water scarcity; land degradation and desertification; 
increasing fossil fuel-based energy production and use with 
high inefficiencies in generation, distribution and end use; 
and conservation and sustainable use of marine and coastal 
resources. Climate change is becoming one of the region’s main 
problems with potentially adverse impacts on the economy and 
human-well being. Water availability is projected to drop in most 
of the region by 2050, mainly due to rising temperatures and 
decreased precipitation (UNEP 2010; IPCC 2007). Much of the 
coast, especially in the GCC countries and Yemen, is vulnerable 
to sea level rise, which threatens large areas with inundation and 
saltwater intrusion (AFED 2009).

The drivers of environmental change in the region are linked to 
peace and security, demography and the state of the economy. 
The international desire to secure valuable energy resources 
and disputes including the current political conflict are playing 
a major role in the ongoing environmental degradation in the 
region. Environmental damage is escalating and the number of 
displaced people is increasing, straining the environment and 
contributing to the degradation of land and water resources 
(UNEP 2010). 

The total population of West Asia was estimated at 134 million 
in 2010, or 1.94 per cent of the world population. Given an 
annual growth rate of around 3 per cent, it is expected to reach 
205 million by 2030 (UNPD 2008). Although fertility rates in the 
region are declining, the momentum of population growth is still 
high, partially due to cultural and religious beliefs and difficulties 
hindering family planning (UNEP 2010). Urban communities 
represent more than 90 per cent of the population of the GCC 
countries, about 75 per cent of the Mashriq sub-region, and 
31 per cent in Yemen. These high population growth rates 
and urbanization together with current consumption patterns 
compound the pressures on the region’s limited land and water 
resources. Generally speaking, the young and ever-increasing 
population, as well as its mobility, represent new prospects 
for development but may also exacerbate pressure on already 
strained resources and ecosystems. More resources and services 
are required to support the demand for jobs, housing, health, 
water, energy and education; hence land use change is expected 
to be a major issue in the region (UNEP 2010). Furthermore, an 
influx of expatriates into the GCC countries only adds to pressure

on already strained and limited land and water resources 
(UN ESCWA 2005). 

Most of the West Asian countries’ economies depend on oil and 
gas export revenues, especially GCC countries. In general, the 
region holds 52.2 per cent of world oil reserves and 24.6 per 
cent of world gas resources (OAPEC 2009). Oil and gas exports 
along with petrochemicals are the main source of income in 
GCC countries. In the Mashriq sub-region and Yemen, however, 
agriculture is the main economic activity, contributing 30 per cent 
of gross domestic product (GDP) and employing more than 40 per 
cent of the workforce (UN ESCWA 2002), although there are also 
some extractive industries in countries such as Jordan and Syria. 
On a per-person basis, the GCC country with the highest GDP 
is Qatar, earning US$77 000 per person in 2010 (UNDP 2010). 
These high earnings are reflected in high per-person energy 
consumption, with many of the GCC countries having carbon 
dioxide (CO2) emissions of more than 25 tonnes per person per 
year in 2006 (UNDP 2010). Furthermore, the concentration of oil 
and extractive industries in the region strains the environment 
by polluting the atmosphere and degrading land and water 
resources. New initiatives are, however, being implemented 
to reduce the emissions and waste output associated with 
development, for example at Masdar City in Abu Dhabi (Sgouridis 
and Kennedy 2010).

The rapid development of the past 30 years has been the main 
driver of continued degradation of the environment in West 
Asia. In spite of the progress that has been achieved to meet 
the MDGs, more effort is needed (UN DESA 2011). Governments 
of the region are dealing with these challenges by creating 
suitable conditions and empowered communities, with national 
environmental policies having been developed in all West Asian 
countries. The UN Conference on Environment and Development 
in 1992 – the Rio Earth Summit – accelerated the setting-up and 
strengthening of environment ministries and authorities, the 
adoption of national strategies, financial resource mobilization 
and the creation of partnerships.

Oceans and seas

Environmental institutions have been accorded high priority and 
status in all countries of West Asia (UNEP 2010), and a range of 
institutions has been established to implement policies, enforce 
laws and set standards and norms. However, these policies remain 
sectoral in nature and participation of the major public groups 
in environmental governance remains weak. There is no clear 
policy for the integration of these groups in the environmental 
governance process at either national or regional levels.

The environmental policies of West Asian countries rely mainly 
on command-and-control mechanisms rather than on economic 
instruments, though there have recently been various 
initiatives to use market-based instruments to offer incentives 
and change behaviour; these include water cost recovery 
options and a road toll system. 

Through a consultative process, the four most pressing 
environmental challenges identified in West Asia are freshwater; 
soil, land use, land degradation and desertification; energy; and 
oceans and seas. Policies and policy considerations relating to 
the cross-cutting issues of environmental governance and climate 
change have been incorporated into the four priority areas as 
appropriate (Figure 14.1). 

POLICY APPRAISAL 
Freshwater 
The water sources of the West Asia region, estimated at 
106.5 km3 (UNEP 2011), consist of renewable surface and 
shallow groundwater resources supplemented by non-renewable 
groundwater, desalinated water and treated wastewater. Surface 
water resources are estimated at 86 km3 concentrated mainly 
in the Mashriq sub-region, with 63 km3 available from mainly 
shared rivers, the Euphrates, Tigris, Jordan, Yarmouk and Al 

376

Part 2: Policy Options

Kabeer al-Jounbi, and the remaining 13 km3 supplied by small 
rivers, springs and intermittent wadi flow (UN ESWCA 2007b; 
Abdulrazzak et al. 2002; Al-Rashed and Sherif 2000; Abdulrazzak 
1995, 1994). The total renewable groundwater resources in the 
region are estimated at 15.5 km3 (UNEP 2011). Iraq, Lebanon and 
Syria rely on river flows supplemented by limited groundwater 
resources, while Jordan, OPT, Yemen and the GCC countries rely 
on renewable groundwater sources supplemented by extensive 
non-renewable groundwater reserves and desalinated water 
(UNEP 2007; Dabour 2006). 

Desalinated water, which has become a dependable domestic 
water supply source, contributes 3.3 km3 and meets 56 per cent 
of the domestic water requirements of the GCC countries (Word 
Bank 2005). The GCC is home to about 44 per cent of world 
desalination capacity (AFED 2010; UN ESCWA 2007b). Around 
2.3 km3 of treated waste and drainage water is used in urban 
landscaping and feed-crop production together with 9 km3 of 
untreated wastewater. Total water demand in the domestic, 
industrial and agricultural sectors was estimated at 83.4 km3 
in 1990, rising to 112.8 km3 in 2000, and is expected to reach 
167.4 km3 in 2025 (UNEP 2011). High population growth and 
urbanization rates, increased frequency of drought and extreme 
events, accelerated economic activities and improved standards 
of living have contributed to the widening gap between supply 
and demand, and to higher levels of pollution and resource 
depletion. The region’s increasing water scarcity is evident in the 
reduction in annual per-person renewable water resources from 
1 050 m3 in 1990, to 553 m3 in 2010; this is expected to fall to 
205 m3 in 2025 compared to a world average of 7 243 m3 per 
person per year (CEDARE and AWC 2004). 

Water scarcity due to climate change may reduce the available 
renewable water resources by 15–20 per cent in the next 50 
years, leading to decreases in the flow of major rivers and 
groundwater recharge rates, a higher frequency of flash floods 
and droughts, and a loss of productivity in rain-fed areas (AFED 
2009). The increase in temperature due to climate change is 
expected to lead to increased water demand, especially for 
irrigated agriculture; saltwater intrusion from sea level rise; a 
decline in provisions for tourism, and changes in crop production 
systems (AFED 2009).

Previous water policies that emphasized the development of 
supply infrastructure made it possible for most of the countries to 
be on track to achieve the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) 
7c targets for water supply and sanitation. Regional coverage in 
2008 reached 92 per cent for water supply and 81 per cent for 
sanitation, with major achievements in urban areas (UN DESA 
2011). Coverage in rural areas is lower, especially in Iraq, Syria, 
Oman, OPT and Yemen. Higher coverage has been achieved in 
the GCC countries than in the Mashriq sub-region, corresponding 
to the availability of financial resources (Figure 14.2). Drinking 
water coverage in West Asia ranges from 100 per cent in most of 
the GCC countries to 52 per cent in Yemen. Between 1990 and 
2008, the coverage for domestic water supply increased by 4 per 
cent and for sanitation by 5 per cent. It is estimated that since

West Asia 377

1990, 47–49 million people have gained access to a drinking 
water supply and 42–43 million to sanitation (UN DESA 2011). 
Most countries are expected to meet the MDG targets in 2015, 
with the exception of Yemen and OPT. Despite the substantial 
progress towards MDG 7c, more than 41 000 people have died 
during the period from 1990 to 2008 because of poor access to 
safe water supplies and inadequate sanitation facilities.

Water policies implemented during 1960–2000 as part of annual 
or five-year development plans addressed water scarcity by 
making use of supplies from major rivers, shallow and deep 
groundwater and desalination. Services were expanded to 
improve water supply and sanitation coverage, especially in 
urban areas, and measures were taken to manage demand, 
including water-saving technology, leak detection and public 
education, and expansion of irrigation schemes to enhance self-
sufficiency in certain commodity food crops.

Since 2000, with the region’s water resources – especially 
renewable resources – exploited to the limit of capacity, 
governments have been paying more attention to developing 
policies that emphasize comprehensive planning, with longer 
horizons in line with the integrated water resources management 
approach called for in the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation 
(WSSD 2002). This takes into account the water deficit of more 
than 50 km3 estimated for 2025. Jordan, OPT and Yemen, and 
more recently United Arab Emirates – have already formulated 
their integrated management plans and begun implementation 
with varying degrees of success. Oman and Saudi Arabia are in 

the process of finalizing their plans while others have established 
timelines (AFED 2010). 

The region’s water policy priorities should focus on three key 
objectives: comprehensive planning within the framework 
of integrated water resources management; supply-demand 
management measures to reduce the water deficit and increase 
water-use efficiency; and management of agricultural water 
consumption. Indicators to measure progress on water supply 
and sanitation are: 
•	 annual	per-person	water	consumption	from	renewable	water	

sources – or water sustainability – as a measure of scarcity 
and depletion; 

•	 population	with	access	to	safe	water	supply	and	sanitation	
as a measure of service coverage and proximity to the MDG 
target; and

•	 water	losses	from	the	irrigation	and	domestic	water	

distribution systems as a measure of water use efficiency.

Planning within an integrated approach
Effective policy calls for planning in line with the principles of 
integrated water resources management. Current efforts have 
been confined to the formulation of water policies within national 
development plans and focused on supply development and 
limited demand management practices (UN ESCWA 2001). For 
some countries, the availability of financial resources has been 
considered a means of addressing the problem.

The planning process should be appropriate to the social, 
economic and cultural conditions of the region while considering 
the complexity of the problem: increasing and competing water 
demands; water governance issues; adaptive capacity in case of 
uncertain water availability and extreme events; changing socio-
economic development patterns – including demographic trends 
and changing consumption patterns; food security and the volatile 
international food market; tension over shared water sources both 
for rivers and aquifers shared between countries of the region as 
well as other neighbouring countries; and climate change impacts.

Coordinated and integrated planning within and across water 
and water-related sectors promotes the balance of supply with 
demand. The objective is to achieve resource sustainability, 
efficiency and protection; to manage risks including climate 
change impacts; and to manage disputed shared sources. 
Additional benefits include increased safe water supply and 
sanitation coverage, especially for the poor; health benefits 
related to water quality; compliance and enforcement of 
legislation; information; and improved cooperation and trust 
in working on shared resources. The region should build on 
experience of integrated water management in Jordan, OPT and 
Yemen – and more recently in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab 
Emirates – to update future plans and share experience with 
other countries (World Bank 2009).

resources in the Lower Jordan Valley, including groundwater, 
wastewater, saline water and floodwater. © Miguel Nicolaevsky/iStock

Among the key limitations are a lack of adequate and trained 
technical and managerial capacity to accommodate the highly 
complex integrated water resources planning process, set well

Part 2: Policy Options

defined objectives, formulate and implement multi-objective 
measures, and commit the necessary financial and human 
resources to strengthen governance issues. Difficulties lie in 
establishing the free dissemination of information and the 
coordination of different data sources; reliable assessment 
resources; and identifying water requirements during a period of 
dynamic socio-economic development and environmental change. 
For transboundary resources, there are conflicting national 
interests in forging equitable sharing agreements. All these 
issues can be addressed through integrated water resources 
management, supported by strong commitment on the part of 
decision makers to place water high on the political agenda.

The integrated water resources management framework is not 
an option but an essential requirement if water management 
is to be enhanced in the region. The experience gained from 
its formulation and implementation in Jordan and OPT can 
inform the planning process of the Mashriq sub-region, while 
Yemen’s plan (Box 14.1) can inform that of the GCC countries, 
which share similar environmental and social conditions. In 
addition, documentation of lessons learned through the practical 
implementation of management measures could help to build 
national capacity for updating any existing integrated water 
management plans.

In terms of environmental governance, certain enabling 
conditions are necessary for the success of the integrated 
approach. Decision makers and stakeholders must fully 
understand the relevant policy statements and must define
the objectives and mandate of the water and water-related 
sectors; enable the free dissemination of information; commit 
the necessary financial and adequately trained human  
resources; increase reliance on national expertise; adopt 
a community-based management approach; and enforce 
coordination mechanisms. This requires comprehensive and 
enforced legislation.

Supply-demand management to reduce water deficits
On the supply side, appropriate measures include the 
development of renewable groundwater within sustainable 
yields; augmentation from water desalination; reuse of 
adequately treated wastewater; rainwater management and 
harvesting; artificial groundwater recharge; flood control 
structures; and a limit on the mining of non-renewable 
groundwater. Demand measures include economic mechanisms 
such as partial cost recovery; socially acceptable tariffs; 
subsidies and incentives for improving water-use efficiency, 
especially in the irrigation sector; modification of building codes 
for water saving; leakage control; decentralization of water 
utilities; groundwater metering; and effective coordination of 
international funds supplemented by public awareness. This is 
in addition to supporting non-governmental organizations and 
stakeholder participation. 

Limited management measures have been implemented in 
Jordan, OPT, Yemen, and recently Saudi Arabia and the United 
Arab Emirates, mainly through water-saving technology, public 
education and leak detection in large cities, and incentives such 
as subsidies and loans.

Expected benefits include coordination in balancing water 
supply through rational utilization of all sources, with demand 
reductions achieved within 25 years. Such rationalization 
includes the use of renewable and non-renewable sources 
within their sustainable yields; increasing domestic supply 
from desalination; reusing adequately treated wastewater; 
establishing strategic groundwater reserves in the Arabian 
Peninsula sub-region and Jordan; and developing rainfall 
harvesting infrastructures in Jordan, Lebanon, Oman, Saudi 
Arabia, Syria, United Arab Emirates and Yemen. Demand 
management measures aim to reduce water losses from 
distribution systems from the present levels to 5–20 per cent 
of the non-renewable resources, especially in the irrigation 

Box 14.1 Yemen’s integrated water resources management plan

Yemen’s progress on water management was supported 
by an investment plan and the prior establishment 
of a comprehensive legislative framework. Supply 
and demand objectives have to a certain extent been 
achieved, aided by assessment of the water supply 
along with supply-and-demand management projects 
in the domestic and irrigation sectors. The supply side 
includes dams for flood control and recharge, control of 
groundwater withdrawal in certain areas, reuse of treated 
wastewater, and rainwater harvesting; while the demand 
side includes such management tools as the renovation 
of terraces, decentralization of water utilities, appropriate 
domestic tariffs, subsidies to improve water-use efficiency 
in the irrigation sector, incentives, and the creation of 
water user associations in coordination with the Ministry 

of Agriculture. Evaluation of climate change impacts was 
also carried out. 

The process involved academics, UN agencies and non-
governmental organizations, in addition to coordination 
of the international funding agencies and identifying the 
necessary financial and human resources. Benefits have 
included improved planning at basin level, increased 
investment in wastewater treatment, increased service 
coverage in the cities of Sana’a, Aden, Taiz, and Hudadiah, 
rationalizing the use of groundwater resources especially 
in the Sana’a basin, and enforcing tariff collection. The 
principal constraints have been under-commitment of 
financial and human resources and a lack of public-private 
sector partnerships (CEDAR and AWC 2004).

sector. Socially acceptable economic tools include gradual cost 
recovery, and loans and incentives to reduce consumption. 
Measures also include administrative steps to decentralize 
functions, change building codes and regulations, encourage 
stakeholder participation and establish modern agricultural 
practices, including hydroponics and irrigation systems. These 
can lead to changes in behaviour and consumption patterns, 
reduced pollution and depletion especially of non-renewable 
and shared sources, and improved water productivity, and can 
contribute to meeting the MDG goals.

The main challenge is to shift water from being heavily regulated 
and subsidized, which is largely dictated by a strong agricultural 
lobby, into the realm of partially priced goods and services. In 
most countries of the region, subsidy policies have contributed 
to wasteful water consumption, though this is now changing in 
Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Syria. Challenges also lie in overcoming 
the reluctance to reuse treated wastewater, providing adequate 
financial sources in the Mashriq sub-region, and low capacity 
for integrated and comprehensive planning, especially in the 
Arabian Peninsula sub-region (AFED 2010). Further, there is 
reluctance to take appropriate action to reduce the power of the 
agriculture lobby. 

Similar economic and social characteristics across the region 
provide opportunities to share many supply-and-demand 
management experiences. Experience of desalination in the 
GCC countries can be shared with the Mashriq sub-region 
while taking full consideration of the environmental impacts, 
especially Jordan, the OPT and Yemen, while measures such 
as water storage and rainwater harvesting infrastructure are 
replicable in most of the countries. Other successes include

Part 2: Policy Options

Box 14.2 Leak detection and repair of the distribution 
system in Bahrain

Water distribution leakage is in the range of 30–50 per 
cent in certain areas in Bahrain, resulting in the loss of 
costly desalinated water, contamination with wastewater 
and changes in the water table that can damage urban 
infrastructure. Bahrain’s management measures achieved a 
5–15 per cent reduction in leakage, saving 25 million m3 of 
desalinated water and reducing costs by US$18–25 million 
in 2000 (World Bank 2008). Improvements were seen in 
water supply reliability and coverage, enhanced technical 
and managerial staff capacity, and reduced impacts 
from a high water table such as nuisance odours, soil 
contamination and damage to urban buildings and roads. 
In addition, the measures helped in-house water auditing, 
and increased public awareness and social responsibility for 
conservation of an already limited resource. Such demand 
management measures could be replicated in many big 
cities in the region.

water-saving technologies, leak detection and repair, public 
awareness campaigns and groundwater metering – introduced, 
for example, in Bahrain (Box 14.2), Jordan, Saudi Arabia and 
Syria – and decentralization of water utilities. In addition, water 
user associations in Jordan (the Local Farmers Association, for 
example), Oman and Yemen can be replicated in all countries. 

Enabling conditions require comprehensive water sector 
reform and include good governance conducive to inter- and 
cross-sectoral coordination; adequate investment; financial 
transparency and accountability; public acceptance of cost 
recovery tools with socially acceptable tariffs; and application 
of the polluter-pays principle. Other enabling conditions include 
commitment to the right to water; ensuring that stakeholders 
have an active role in decision making; a free flow of information; 
separation of service providers and regulatory functions; and 
effective capacity-building programmes.

Management of agricultural water consumption
The agricultural sector, which uses more than 85 per cent of the 
region’s water, has been oriented towards food self-sufficiency 
in certain commodities and overall food security in light of 
increasing food prices, rural development and rising incomes. 
In Lebanon, Jordan, Syria and Yemen, the sector employs 
30–40 per cent of the domestic population, while in the GCC 
countries it depends on foreign labour (UNEP 2010). Agricultural 
intensification has accelerated groundwater depletion, especially 
in the Arabian Peninsula, as well as increased agro-pollution 
and soil salinity. The sector is characterized by low irrigation 
efficiency of 30–45 per cent and the cultivation of particularly 
water-thirsty crops, resulting in low water productivity (AOAD 
2009). Water scarcity and pollution can be alleviated by 
increasing the use of adequately treated wastewater; rainwater 

harvesting on mountain terraces; modern agricultural and 
irrigation systems; and subsidies, incentives and soft loans to 
promote the application of water-saving technologies. Water 
sustainability can also be enhanced by groundwater metering, 
partial cost-recovery tariffs, application of the virtual water 
concept, increasing the number of water user associations, 
market integration between countries, and making use of World 
Trade Organization (WTO) and other trade agreements. 

The benefits of integrated management to the agricultural sector 
include enhanced water-use efficiency of 15–30 per cent above 
the current level, resulting in substantial water savings and 
increasing the water available to meet domestic demand and 
achieve the MDG targets (UN DESA 2011). Improving water-use 
efficiency will increase water productivity and farmer income, 
and conserve non-renewable groundwater for future generations. 
The current system of subsidies and soft loans available for 
modern agricultural and irrigation systems provides an effective 
economic tool to reduce water consumption and prevent 
groundwater depletion and pollution from agrochemicals. 
The current secondary and tertiary level wastewater treatment 
facilities, especially in GCC countries, provide water suitable for 
a number of crops (UNEP 2010). However, more attention should 
be given to the monitoring and enforcement of water-saving 
technologies to reach a defined level of efficiency and achieve 
appropriate water treatment standards. 

Limited commitment to providing the necessary financial 
resources to implement water-saving irrigation technologies and 
assess climate change will impact water availability, agricultural 
productivity and biodiversity. Problems include difficulties in 
convincing farmers to shift to modern irrigation techniques and 
use treated wastewater, and in developing adequate human 
resources to monitor compliance with water treatment standards, 
along with weak marketing strategies and the impact of foreign 
labour. Other challenges include overcoming reluctance to 

move away from the concept of irrigation water as free or 
heavily subsidized, especially groundwater, to acceptance of 
cost recovery and pricing of water allocations. There is a need 
for significant investment in wastewater treatment, awareness 
campaigns, modernized irrigation and agricultural systems, and 
the establishment of user associations. 

Agricultural policies have to be compatible, coordinated and 
integrated with broader water policies. Investment is required for 
wastewater facilities to increase reuse volumes, and for subsidies 
and loans to increase take-up of water-saving technologies. 
Enabling conditions must be established for setting efficiency 
rate targets of 75 per cent for irrigation, and for the gradual 
phase-out of water-thirsty and low cash-value crops in favour of 
importing crops (the virtual water concept). Growing wheat, for 
example, requires large amounts of water. By importing wheat 
and concentrating on crops that require less water, a country can 
acquire virtual water and use existing resources more efficiently.

Additional measures include limiting the export of green animal 
feed, increasing the number of water user associations and 
taking advantage of WTO and bilateral agreements between Arab 
countries (UNEP 2010).

Similarities in the irrigation supply, consumption practices 
and arid environment of most countries provide opportunities 
to share success stories as well as market and trade 
complementarities, and take advantage of possibilities for 
integration at the regional or sub-regional level. The success of 
large agricultural companies in Saudi Arabia could, for example, 
help some countries of the Mashriq sub-region to expand their 
activities and increase water productivity. Use of the virtual 
water concept and intra-region agricultural policies provide an 
opportunity for cooperation in agricultural production based on 
comparative advantage, while conserving local water resources 
for future generations (Box 14.3).

Box 14.3 Irrigation management in Saudi Arabia

Saudi Arabia’s agricultural sector is responsible for more than 
85 per cent of the country’s water consumption, especially 
from non-renewable and sometimes shared groundwater 
resources. During 2005–2007, renewable water resources 
of 2.5 million m3 were supplemented with 16.2 million m3 
from non-renewable groundwater sources to satisfy irrigation 
demands. Even though the 2010 total demand of 18.7 million 
m3 is expected to decrease to 12 million m3 in 2025, the gap 
between the total irrigation demand and the supply from 
renewable water sources will still be considerable. 

The government recently implemented a number of measures 
to limit irrigated food production by decreasing the subsidy on 
diesel fuel and gradually reducing the purchase of local wheat. In 
2009, it set a target to eliminate wheat production over an eight-

year period, and at the same time increased incentives and loans 
for modern irrigation systems, provided subsidies for animal 
feed imports while banning the export of fodder, and established 
strategic food reserves (AFED 2010). Further measures have been 
implemented to freeze the amount of land used for agriculture; 
promote cultivation under glass; improve the coordination of the 
agricultural sector with other relevant policies; and encourage 
agricultural investment abroad by forming committees and 
setting aside funds to encourage the private sector. These 
measures have contributed to reducing the amount of irrigated 
land, the production of wheat and groundwater mining, and 
increased interest in the reuse of treated water (Hussain et al. 
2010). Future action includes evaluation of irrigation cost-
recovery options, groundwater metering and setting limits on 
water allocation to the various sectors.

Soil, land use, land degradation and desertification
Most of West Asia is characterized by patchy vegetation, sandy 
soils and arid to hyper-arid conditions. Drylands make up 64 
per cent of the total area of 4 million km2 (Abahussain et al. 
2002; Al Kassas 1999). Rangelands fall into the largest land-use 
category, with lands cultivated with annual and permanent crops 
representing 4.8 per cent, and forests 1.4 per cent (FAOSTAT 
2008; AOAD 2007). High and sustained population growth and 
urbanization rates coupled with rising rates of consumption 
increase the pressure on limited land resources. 

The biophysical characteristics of the region, combined with 
population growth and socio-economic policies, are the main 
drivers of land degradation and desertification, one of the 
main problems facing West Asia. Proximate causes include 
intensification of crop and livestock production and pastoral 
activities; development of human settlements and infrastructure; 
wars; policies that subsidize unsustainable practices such as 
irrigation with fossil or saline water; overuse of agrochemicals; 
overstocking of livestock; and lack of appropriate integrated water-
land-use planning and management. All these developments have 
resulted in reduced ecosystem products and services, widespread 
desertification and land degradation including biodiversity loss, 
which, in turn, affects human well-being (ACSAD et al. 2004). 

The impacts of land degradation have been most serious in 
the countries where the share of agriculture in gross domestic 
product (GDP) is high, such as Lebanon, Syria and Yemen 
(UNEP 2010), and are further exacerbated by frequent droughts 
and climate change. Policies to combat land degradation 
and desertification must take into consideration the region’s 
multiple challenges of sustained population growth, rapid 
urbanization rates, increasing demand for natural resources, 
a declining natural resource base, varying rates of economic 
growth and increasing incidence of poverty in communities that 

depend mainly on land resources. A lack of financial resources, 
appropriate technologies and institutional capacities, as well as 
limited stakeholder and civil society participation must also be 
taken into account (SRAP 2007).

Indicators for measuring the progress of selected land-use 
policies include: 
•	 the	proportion	of	land	affected	by	desertification	(erosion	and	

salinization);

•	 the	proportion	of	land	that	falls	into	nationally	protected	

areas and forest;

•	 livestock	numbers	relative	to	the	carrying	capacity	of	

rangelands;

•	 land-use	change,	including	the	proportion	of	productive	area	

lost to urbanization; 

•	 the	proportion	of	land	under	modern	irrigation;	and	
•	 levels	of	productivity	(tonnes	per	hectare)	and	production	

(tonnes per year).

Successful policy options that show potential to accelerate the 
achievement of internationally agreed goals can be addressed as 
three clusters:
•	 developing	rangelands	and	combating	land	degradation;
•	 achieving	food	security	and	cropland	rehabilitation;	and
•	 adopting	integrated	policies	for	improving	land	and	water	use	

with local community participation.

Developing rangelands and combating land degradation
Policies to develop national and regional rangelands help 
to improve their management by prohibiting cultivation in 
designated areas while protecting and rehabilitating degraded 
rangelands (Box 14.4) (Kattach 2008).

The benefits include the protection, conservation, sustainability 
and improvement of natural vegetation productivity and diversity. 

382

Part 2: Policy Options

Box 14.4 Protection and rehabilitation of 
rangelands in Syria

The main objective of Syria’s policy is to conserve vegetation 
density, productivity and biological diversity, improve the 
livelihoods of local communities, reduce dust and sand 
storms, and increase carbon sequestration. The aim is to 
protect and rehabilitate degraded areas in the Al-Bishri 
rangeland of the Syrian steppe. Implementation involves 
local community participation in selecting degraded areas, 
seeding and planting, and the control and reduction of 
grazing pressure through collaboration between local 
herders and animal-fattening cooperatives. After three 
years of rehabilitation and protection, forage production 
increased from 90 kg to 320 kg per hectare per year and bare 
soil decreased from 91 to 32 per cent. The diversity of plants 
increased from 27 species from 23 genera and 13 families 
to 83 species from 55 genera and 17 families, and the 
density of edible shrubs increased from 0.02 to 4 plants 
per m2 (Kattach 2008). In the long term, vegetation density, 
productivity and diversity, and carbon sequestration are 
expected to increase to optimum levels, alongside the 
prevention of dust and sand storms. This is in addition to 
providing more forage for livestock, reducing the need for 
feed and the cost of meat production.

In addition, improved rangelands help to prevent soil erosion, 
conserve water, increase carbon sequestration, reduce both the 
frequency and magnitude of dust and sand storms, and provide 
links to global support for combating desertification. Limitations 
include reduced open grazing areas for herders, competition with 
cropping, lower direct financial returns to herders and increasing 
risk of conflict with local communities.

These policies can be replicated and scaled up for implementation 
in similar degraded rangelands at regional and global levels. 

Achieving food security and cropland rehabilitation
Food security has continued to be the main concern of national 
governments in the region since the concept was introduced 
in the 1980s. The world food crisis in 2007, accompanied by 
soaring food prices, revitalized the need and desire of some 
countries to become self-sufficient in certain agricultural 
commodities, and especially to restrict the export of cereals and 
livestock feed (AOAD 2009). As a result, national agricultural 
policies were revised to increase agricultural production, and 
government control of farming systems was relaxed in favour of 
decentralization. Avenues for offering incentives in the form of 
price controls, tax breaks and reductions, cereal and animal feed 
export restrictions, easy loans, and the introduction of efficient 
techniques in reclamation and irrigation were explored. This is in 
addition to developing adaptation policies to climate change such 
as using saline water for agricultural production, developing new 
local crop varieties tolerant of aridity and drought conditions, and 
rehabilitating rainwater harvesting systems (Box 14.5).

After introducing a series of incentive measures, benefits have 
included relative food security with regard to certain commodities, 
which in turn reduced dependency on food imports and helped to 
alleviate poverty and hunger.

The limitations to agricultural practices such as flood irrigation 
have included depletion of water resources in a region that is 
already water-short. Overuse of aquifers has led groundwater to 
suffer from saltwater intrusion in coastal regions, and salination 
has rendered large areas of agricultural land useless and 
converted landscapes into desert (Hussain et al. 2010). However, 
the governments of the region are left with no choice but to reclaim 
new areas and salinated fields, and re-cultivate them in order to 
meet the ever-increasing demands for food. Drought and climate 
change are working against achieving food security, as persistent 
drought has continued to affect the region for the past few years.

Policies to improve agricultural productivity are being  
replicated with modifications to suit each country’s economic 
and social conditions.

Box 14.5 Sustainable agricultural development in Bahrain

The National Strategy for Sustainable Agricultural Development 
aims to upgrade the agricultural sector in Bahrain. It includes 
goals and programmes that contribute to agricultural growth 
and preserve agricultural heritage. The main objectives of the 
strategy include achieving relative food security, conserving 
natural resources, protecting agricultural land, using modern 
technologies to encourage agricultural investment, making 
the agricultural sector economically efficient, contributing to 
the needs of citizens and residents for food, and supporting 
small farmers (Ministry of Municipalities Affairs and Land 
Use Planning 2010). To attain the strategy’s objectives, 
communication and cooperation were enhanced between 

the various parties involved in the country’s agricultural 
sector. In addition, the strategy concentrates on involving 
diverse communities while paying special attention to 
farmers as central to agricultural development. 

Benefits of the strategy include the modernization of 
production systems, conservation of water and land, 
increased agricultural productivity, relative food security, 
reduced groundwater consumption, increased vegetation 
cover including palm trees, a boost to agricultural trade, 
promotion of the national economy and a reduction in

In order to create enabling conditions, governments of the region 
eased access to finance and technical services. Agricultural 
research and extension were strengthened to boost productivity 
and conserve water and land resources, thus promoting good 
agricultural practices. New crop varieties suited to drought 
conditions were introduced as well as new cultivation methods.

Enabling conditions for rangeland protection policies in West 
Asia have been jointly implemented by various institutions, with 
assistance from developed countries and research centres. The 
success of land degradation control depends on the presence of 
a favourable framework, including organizational, institutional, 
legal and political structures and processes that promote 
programme planning and implementation. This included analysis 
of the factors influencing institutional response capacity, and 
from there the development of recommendations for capacity 
building and participatory modalities (UN ESCWA 2007a).

Integrated policies for improving land and water use with local 
community participation 
The 2007 report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 
(IPCC 2007) indicates that the problem of land degradation and 
desertification prevalent in West Asia will be exacerbated by 
climate change. The expected increase in temperature, decline 
in precipitation, and greater intensity and frequency of droughts 
and dust storms will impact rangelands and rain-fed cropland and 
contribute to land deterioration, biodiversity loss and the spread 
and intensification of desertification. 

Mindful of this, Jordan’s policies deal with the strategic 
improvement of rain-fed agriculture and the prevention of land 
degradation and desertification. Achieving these objectives 
involves long-term mainstreaming of integrated strategies 
for improving productivity; rehabilitating, conserving and 
sustaining land and water resources; combating desertification; 
and mitigating the impacts of drought and climate change.

Part 2: Policy Options

Implementing these strategies is more effective with the 
participation of local traditional resource users, recognizing the 
interrelationship between these and other environmental issues 
at the local, national, regional and global levels (Box 14.6). 
The benefits of these policies are the protection, conservation, 
sustainability and optimization of natural resource productivity 
and the potential for diversifying income sources with links 
to global support for improving farmers’ livelihoods. Factors 
that determine success include soil and water conservation, 
irrigation, forestry, livestock, range management and community-
based resource management, enhanced technical capacity 
of local managers and local institution building. Indicators of 
success include the long-term rehabilitation of degraded lands, 
halting of desertification processes and increased resilience 
to climate change, while short-term benefits include increased 
agricultural productivity, improvements in individual and family 
incomes, greater drought resistance of rural production systems 
and protection of biodiversity (UN ESCWA 2007a).

In semi-arid areas the implementation of policies with an 
emphasis on agricultural production leads to a reduction in the 
rangeland available for livestock grazing. In many countries most 
of the farmers are also livestock owners and their herds graze 
on lands with low productivity and on crop residues. Farming 
practices in these areas return very few nutrients and organic 
matter to the soil and provide little protection from wind erosion. 
Livestock grazing of virtually all crop residues is particularly 
problematic (UN ESCWA 2007a). Policy limitations also include 
the continuous out-migration of the younger members of rural 
families, creating local labour shortages. 

In many countries of the region successful programmes tend 
to emphasize the significance of comprehensiveness and 
integration. An excellent policy in one country does not usually 
stand alone and, as such, cannot easily be transferred or 
successfully replicated in its original form in a new location 
(UN ESCWA 2007a). New circumstances, new management 
and various interdependent problems such as poor and low 
implementation capacities, lack of financial resources and 
marginalized local stakeholders, can make many successful 
programmes lose their effectiveness under replication.

The evaluation and assessment of successful policies have 
demonstrated that the alleviation of land degradation depends 
not only on the motivation of individual stakeholders, but also on 
the creation of enabling conditions for effective collective action 
by the whole community, and this makes implementation of 
such policies more challenging. The development of appropriate 
policy frameworks and incentive structures is key to inducing 
sustainable management of natural resources. Environmental 
governance should be incorporated in the activities of social, 
economic and administrative institutions, with environmental 
and land-use policies central to the coordination and 
management of the various sectors of the national economy. 
Governance encourages the use and application of scientific 
data and information for the sustainable development of natural 
resources. On a larger scale, it fosters an understanding of the 

Box 14.6 Integrated agricultural management in Al-Karak, Jordan

The main objectives of Jordan’s policy were to arrest land 
degradation, optimize the long-term productive capacity of land 
and water resources, improve the income of vulnerable farmers, 
especially women, with their active participation, safeguard 
and upgrade the productive potential of natural resources and 
enhance returns, prevent soil degradation, restore soil fertility, 
promote efficient use of soil and water, strengthen the capacity 
of local technical and managerial staff, and meet the needs 
of local farmers. To achieve these objectives, the programme 
provides technical and financial support aimed at:
•	 building	soil	and	water	conservation	structures	and	

improving agricultural production;

•	 enhancing	sustainable	land	and	water	management	

practices;

•	 promoting	rural	microfinance	to	support	on-	and	off-farm	

activities;

•	 tree	planting;
•	 building	cisterns	and	dams	for	water	harvesting;
•	 improving	animal	husbandry;
•	 maintaining	springs	and	irrigation	canals;	and
•	 constructing	small	reservoirs,	known	as	hafira, to retain 

run-off for later use. 

Local communities have benefited from the newly vibrant 
agricultural sector through processing local products and 
having better access to financial services. Some 5 350 
households have benefited from the various soil and water 
conservation measures, while spring protection and/or 
rehabilitation programmes alone having benefited about 
1 000 households (Ministry of Water and Irrigation 2008). 
The improved agricultural extension services are estimated 
to have reached about 22 300 households, and the  
provision of loans and support for developing alternative 
income-generating activities has benefited more than 
5 000 women and landless farmers (UN ESCWA 2007a). 

These investments in soil and water conservation have 
reduced and will continue to reduce the degradation of the 
fragile ecosystems in the project area. They will also improve 
vegetative cover, reduce run-off and soil loss, improve soil 
fertility, and enhance sustainable use of the natural resource 
base. The project has raised awareness about the impacts of 
land degradation and desertification while improving farmer’s 
livelihoods, diversifying income sources, and alleviating both 
poverty and out-migration.

main economic, social and environmental issues among many 
stakeholders, helping to achieve a balance between governance 
needs and governance capacity (UN ESCWA 2007a).

Energy 
Energy resources
West Asia is one of the major players in the global energy market, 
having 52.2 per cent of world oil reserves and 24.6 per cent of 
world gas resources (OAPEC 2009). The region produces nearly 
17.3 million barrels of oil a day, accounting for 27.6 per cent 
of world oil exports. Rapid economic development, population 
growth, urbanization, and changes in standards of living in West 
Asian countries have led to increases in energy demand (Figure 
14.3) (IEA World Energy Agency 2010). Despite rich renewable 
resources, the energy sector is characterized by heavy reliance 
on fossil fuels. In addition, the regional economy is still largely 
dependent on fossil fuels to fulfill increasing energy demands. 
The use of fossil fuels is always accompanied by considerable 
environmental impacts including deteriorating local air quality 
and rising greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere, 
contributing to climate change.

Energy consumption rose steadily in most of West Asia 
between 2004 and 2008, increasing by some 20 per cent 
over the period (Ruble and Nader 2011). But with accelerating 
rates of development and rapid urbanization in the majority 
of the region, energy demand is now increasing drastically 
in all sectors, including electric power production, domestic 
energy use and transport. In view of energy security and safety

issues, the sharp increase in oil and gas prices, climate change 
and environmental considerations, as well as technological 
advances, energy planning in several countries is now addressing 
more decentralized energy generation options. The region is 
characterized by rich renewable resources including solar, wind, 
geothermal and, to some extent, biomass, and over the past 
decade has been shifting its policies towards diversification 
of energy sources and placed energy efficiency and renewable 
technologies high on national policy agendas. Some examples 
of renewable energy initiatives include Jordan’s objective to 
generate as much as 7 per cent of its energy from renewable 
sources by 2015 and 10 per cent by 2020, while solar capacity 
is expected to reach 300–600 megawatts over the same period; 
Abu Dhabi’s aim of generating up to 7 per cent of its energy 
from renewable sources, with planned investments reaching 
US$22 billion; Syria’s intention to generate 7.5 per cent of 
its electrical energy from renewable resources by 2020; and 
Lebanon’s target for renewable energy of 10 per cent of total 
energy supply by 2013 and 12 per cent by 2020 while also 
aiming to reduce energy consumption by 6 per cent by the 2013 
(Ruble and Nader 2011; Verdeil 2008). 

Successful energy policies in the countries of West Asia cluster 
around two main areas:
•	 energy	efficiency	in	the	building	sector	including	systems	for	
space heating and cooling, and measures for promoting the 
use of renewable energy resources; and 

•	 energy	generation	mixes	and	targets	for	clean	energy

advanced legislation.

Part 2: Policy Options

Indicators for measuring the progress of the selected energy 
policies are:
•	 energy	savings	in	percentage	terms	or	cost	terms,	reduced	air	

conditioning system sizes and impacts on local markets;
•	 total	surface	area	of	solar	water	heaters	installed	(market	

penetration); and

•	 diversification	of	energy	sources	as	part	of	countries’	plans,	and	

renewable energy capacity as a proportion of total capacity.

Policies that have been shown to be effective in reducing energy 
consumption with the participation of the local community 
address the energy performance of buildings and their cooling 
and water systems (Hajiah 2010; Maheshwari and Al-Murad 
2001), promote renewable energy resources (Shahin 2010; 
Houri 2006; Kablan 2004) and encourage diversification of 
energy supply options (Ruble and Nader 2011; Hainoun et al. 
2010; Reiche 2010). These policies may have high potential for 
replication in countries with similar climate or socio-economic 
characteristics and similar regulations to those of West Asia. 

Regional policy interventions for improving buildings’ 
energy performance and implementing renewable energy 
enhancements such as water heating are directly linked to policy 
formulation regarding population growth, urbanization, and 
associated economic activities and technological affordability. 
Further policies that are of equal importance, but have only 
recently been formulated, address public transport, car fleet age 
and codes for fuel use.

Building and systems energy performance 
Energy efficiency in the building sector has been a primary 
national target for West Asian countries, and thermal guidelines 
and codes for buildings have been developed and implemented 
in most of the region (Ali et al. 2008; Alnaser et al. 2008; Aftab 
and Elhadidy 2002). Al-Ajlan et al. (2006) reported that improving 
the efficiency of Saudi Arabia’s air-conditioning alone provided 
a return on investment equivalent to 400–500 megawatts per 
year of generating capacity, a saving of up to US$250 million 
per year. The countries’ energy performance codes for buildings 
focused on solutions to improve heating and cooling loads and 
have, to some extent, addressed the use of efficient systems and 
processes for heating/cooling and lighting. 

More recent codes tackle green building design and performance. 
Hybrid air-conditioning, for example, has high potential 
for saving energy either through optimized operation or by 
integrating renewable energy sources into their function (Farraj 
et al. 2010; Fasiuddin et al. 2010; Ghaddar et al. 2010; Ghali et 
al. 2008). Building code development has reached an advanced 
stage, and is now considering smart systems and green designs 
that meet the American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and Air-
conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) goal of zero-energy building in 
the coming decade. The development of carbon-neutral Masdar 
City in Abu Dhabi is a process of “transforming oil wealth into 
renewable energy leadership”, with the long-term goal of a 
“transition from a 20th century, carbon-based economy into a 
21st century sustainable economy” (Reiche 2010).

The introduction of green building codes in some West 
Asian countries has been successful in reducing electricity 
consumption in buildings through guiding the selection of 
building materials and glazing choices, and setting upper limits 
on lighting intensity and cooling/heating (Al-Temeemi 1995; 
Kellow 1989). The success of this policy has been due to multiple 
factors including: 
•	 a	rigorous	technical	methodology	for	developing	a	building	

code responsive to a country’s climate and the availability of 
building materials; 

•	 a	short	payback	period	for	several	of	the	proposed	energy	

conservation measures; 

•	 the	ability	to	ensure	compliance	through	setting	upper	limits	

on the capacity of the electric supply/meter to the building 
unit; 

•	 the	ability	to	enforce	building	codes	in	the	public	and	

commercial sectors; 

•	 awareness	and	understanding	among	the	professional	

community of best practices to improve building 
performance; and 

•	 flexibility	and	room	for	innovation	in	the	selection	and	
introduction of new energy conservation measures and 
practices that provide the contractor, owner and operator of 
the building with choice (Maheshwari and Al-Murad 2001). 

The significance of such concepts and products is evident in 
their incorporation in international standards for green buildings 
such as the Building Research Establishment Environmental 
Assessment Method (BREEAM) and Leadership in Energy 
and Environmental Design (LEED), which use environmental 
assessment methods and rating systems.

The development of thermal codes and ratings enables 
countries to reduce operational energy consumption for heating, 
ventilation, air-conditioning (HVAC) and lighting over a building’s 
life cycle, thus reducing emissions of greenhouse gases. By 
adopting green building envelopes that provide high insulation 
and air tightness, energy savings of 30 per cent and higher have 
been achieved in Bahrain, Jordan and Kuwait, among others 

(Hajiah 2010; Ministry of Public Work and Housing 2009a, 
2009b; Alnaser et al. 2008; Maheshwari and Al-Murad 2001). 
The introduction of building thermal codes and ratings can be 
implemented through limiting the electric power supply capacity 
to a building, which forces designers and contractors to follow 
the code. Energy conservation in buildings extends beyond 
the envelope to include cooling systems, solar water-heating 
systems and energy-efficient appliances. It also calls for the 
greater availability of green market products and technologies 
associated with building services and materials.

The main challenges hampering the implementation of new 
building codes include higher capital costs, the need for short 
and long-term planning, low skill levels and both financial and 
strategic inadequacy. The economic feasibility of adopting 
building codes is well established and the costs of some envelope 
measures have been reduced by the use of local materials, while 
others such as double glazing remain expensive. Countries with 
moderate climates such as Lebanon and Syria can use other less 
expensive cooling methods such as fans and evaporative coolers. 
Not all GCC countries have implemented building codes, although 
they can afford them. Nonetheless, the market is open for transfer 
of green designs and services for buildings. 

GCC countries are coordinating their energy regulations and 
encouraging the exchange of case studies of successful 
sustainable buildings. Some countries with moderate climates 
in the Mediterranean, Jordan, for example, have implemented a 
code or, like Lebanon, are considering guidelines while providing 
incentives through reduced building fees for those following 
the code (Chedid and Ghajar 2004). The Kuwait Energy Code for 
buildings is a good example that could be replicated not only by 
GCC countries with similar climatic conditions and a need for air-
conditioning around the year, but also for West Asian countries 
facing the problem of drastic increases in energy demand 
(Box 14.7) (Hajiah 2010; Maheshwari and Al-Murad 2001). In 
addition, thermal insulation according to the Syrian Thermal 
Insulation Code is mandatory for new buildings in Syria (Ministry 
of Electricity 2007a). With climate change resulting in warmer 

Box 14.7 Energy conservation in buildings in Kuwait

Demand for electrical power In Kuwait has progressively 
increased, particularly in the past two decades. Generated 
capacity was about 11 000 megawatts in 2009, and this is 
expected to rise to about 22 000 megawatts in 2020 (Hajiah 
2010). As all electricity generation depends on fossil fuel 
resources, power plants consume about 55 per cent of Kuwait’s 
total primary energy. In addition, 85 per cent of electrical peak 
power and 60 per cent of the country’s total annual output is 
used for air-conditioning and lighting in buildings. 

The Ministry of Energy in Kuwait launched its energy code 
for buildings in 1983 with a set of mandatory standards and 

regulations to enhance energy conservation and decrease the 
progressive negative impacts on the climate (Hajiah 2010; 
Maheshwari and Al-Murad 2001). The main objectives of the 
building code, which is applied to new and retrofitted air-
conditioned buildings, are to decrease the capacity of air-
conditioning systems and to reduce the peak power demand by 
introducing smaller units.

Table 14.1 shows the energy savings and peak-power 
reductions in some of Kuwait’s buildings. The implementation 
of the energy code has saved Kuwait nearly US$10 billion over 
the past two decades (Hajiah 2010).

conditions in the Mediterranean region, the adoption of building 
codes becomes a necessity (UN ESCWA 2008).

Building codes that use local materials, green products and 
energy-efficient systems for cooling, heating and lighting require 
cooperative and well-organized planning by the government, 
by financial, educational and legislative institutions, and by 
the private sector. It is vital for the government to establish the 
necessary reforms and then to make them mandatory for all new 
and retrofitted air-conditioned buildings.

Promoting renewable energy resources
Some West Asian countries have adopted policies to promote 
the use of solar technologies including solar water heaters, 
taking advantage of the area’s abundance of natural solar energy. 
These policies particularly address the needs of remote and rural 
populations with only an unreliable supply of conventional energy 
or none at all. This has been done in parallel with the adoption 
of performance standards for solar water-heating systems and 
awareness campaigns that demonstrate their economic, social 
and environmental benefits. Policies include subsidies for water 
heaters and tax exemptions for their manufacture; for example, 
Syria has made the installation of solar water-heating systems 
mandatory for new buildings and an assessment has to be carried 
out and submitted with the application for a building license 
(Hainoun et al. 2010; Kraidy 2007). In Jordan and the OPT, raw 
materials for manufacturing solar water heaters are tax exempt 
(PEC 2006; Hrayshat and Al-Soud 2004).

Solar water heaters have multiple benefits. They rely on pollution-
free, inexhaustible and safe energy, and are simple, reliable, 
cheap and easy to install. They reduce consumption of fossil fuels 
and emissions of greenhouse gases. In summer months, when 
the entire region enjoys long sunny periods, solar water heaters 
can meet most of the demand for domestic hot water, drastically 
reducing consumers’ energy use. 

Solar water heating has become an increasingly common and cost-
effective way of meeting domestic energy demand. © Igor Bystrov

The main challenges to the widespread use of solar water-
heating systems include fossil fuel or electrical energy 
subsidies, lack of financing schemes and incentive 
programmes, low levels of public awareness, limited 
distribution and the need for a larger number of qualified 
personnel to design, size, install and maintain the systems. 
The role of government is indispensible in developing the 
market through establishing energy standards and labelling 
programmes, regulatory instruments to mandate installation in

new residential and commercial buildings, innovative financing 
schemes, and other economic incentives. In addition, testing, 
certification and accreditation schemes should be introduced 

Box 14.8 Solar water heaters in Jordan and the 
Occupied Palestinian Territories

With economic growth and an increasing population, energy 
consumption in Jordan is expected to increase by 50 per 
cent over the next 20 years. Indeed, the primary energy 
demand of 7.5 million tonnes of oil-equivalent in 2008 
is expected to double by 2020. In the OPT, around 96 per 
cent of the energy requirement is currently met by imports, 
accounting for up to 19.6 per cent of GDP (Shahin 2010). 
Around 38 per cent of its energy use is domestic.

The serious scarcity of fossil fuel resources leaves the OPT 
relying totally on imports, which reached about US$374 
million in 2009 (Shahin 2010). The cost of electricity 
typically represents 10 per cent of household incomes, 
exceeding levels in neighbouring countries (Abu Hamed et 
al. 2012; Abualkhair 2007). 

With Jordan and OPT, like the rest of the region, enjoying 
long periods of high solar intensity, solar water heating is an 
effective solution to meeting residential energy demands. By 
enhancing solar water heating, Jordan aims to increase its 
share of energy from renewable sources to about 7 per cent 
in 2015 and 10 per cent in 2020, equivalent to 200–600 
megawatts of solar energy (Shahin 2010). 

to make sure that the quality of the systems is acceptable and 
meets consumer expectations. 

With the same climate as Jordan and OPT (Box 14.8), Lebanon 
has the potential to promote a range of solar energy applications 
(Ghaddar et al. 2006; Al-Mohamad 2001), and has recently 
initiated a programme for installation of solar water heaters, 
providing zero-interest loans to consumers (Houri 2006). Syria 
has plans for further promotion of solar water heating and GCC 
countries are currently developing their own plans.

Strengthening the legislative and institutional framework is 
indispensable in the diffusion of green energy technologies 
including solar water heaters. To overcome the barrier of high 
up-front costs, governments can provide financial incentives, 
as in Jordan, Lebanon and Syria, and/or make concessional 
funding available to consumers. In addition, marketing 
campaigns that educate the public about the economic and 
environmental benefits of renewable energy are vital (Ghaddar 
et al. 2006; Houri 2006; Kablan 2004). All these need to be 
complemented by building local capacity through training and 
education programmes. 

Diversifying energy supply options 
Emerging technologies are expected to accelerate diversification 
of energy supply options for the region, which has a proven 
abundance of renewable energy resources, especially solar 
and wind. Oil-importing countries such as Jordan and Lebanon 
have already adopted polices to diversify their fuel mix by using 
renewable energy technologies. The same policies are at the 
early stages of development in the oil-rich countries of the GCC. 
As indicated in Table 14.2, many countries of the region have 
already announced national renewable energy targets.

The benefits of a diversified energy supply include its 
contribution to meeting the energy needs of people and 
stimulating economic growth, which is of particular interest in 
hydrocarbon-scarce economies. Indigenous renewable energy 
enables oil-importing countries to secure their supply, avoid 
the volatility of the global oil market, reduce dependence 
on imports, and minimize burdens on the state budget. In 
addition, diversification of sources might encourage West Asian 
countries to share complementary energy supplies. The region is 
highly reliant on fossil fuels and has one of the highest carbon 
footprints in the world (Reiche 2010). Switching to sustainable 
sources of energy would help improve both environmental 
quality and public health while reducing greenhouse gas 
emissions and conserving non-renewable fossil fuel resources 
for future generations. Promoting renewable energy technologies

would, additionally, improve energy access, particularly in 
remote and rural areas.

A number of barriers often put renewable energy solutions at 
an economic, regulatory or institutional disadvantage, and the 
situation in West Asia is no exception. These barriers include 
a lack of or weak legal and institutional frameworks; slow and 
incomplete market-liberalization processes; poor capacity for 
managing and disseminating information about the opportunities 
provided by renewable energy technologies; low levels of 
consumer awareness leading to low demand; lack of national 
standards, testing and certification schemes; weak capacity in 
local assembly and manufacturing, distribution, installation and 
maintenance; and a lack of proper financing schemes together 
with heavily subsidized prices for oil and gas. To overcome such 
barriers, different countries have developed a range of policy 
packages, appropriate to their national circumstances, that 
combine both regulatory and market-based instruments.

Diversification of the energy supply has high potential for 
replication in the region. Several countries have already started 
to develop national energy strategies that include this policy and 
the rest are planning to do the same.

Governments have a central role to play in setting and developing 
national energy strategies and master plans. Public-private 
partnerships are vital for achieving renewable energy objectives, 
as private-sector investment is often necessary to overcome 
shortages of the capital needed for expanding energy systems. 
Governments need to develop an enabling environment 
conducive to private-sector participation. Reforming the energy 
sector, allowing independent power producers to enter the 
market, and formulating regulatory mechanisms to secure fair 
market competition would be major steps to achieving this.

Oceans and seas
West Asian countries lie within three different major areas: 
the Regional Organization for the Protection of the Marine 
Environment (ROPME) area, the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, and 
the Eastern Mediterranean Sea. All countries have coastal areas, 
with the Sultanate of Oman, Saudi Arabia and Yemen having the 
largest, while Iraq and Kuwait have the smallest (UNEP 2010). 

The different coastal and marine environments of West Asia 
are facing common threats due to pressures resulting from 
national development plans, including the urbanization of 
coastal zones, tourism, land use and reclamation (Figure 14.4), 
maritime and oil traffic, rapid industrialization and overfishing 
(Sheppard et al. 2010). In addition, due to specific socio-
economic conditions, the impacts on the marine and coastal 
environment are more severe in some areas than others. Among 
the issues are the depletion of living resources, coastal zone 
degradation and marine pollution, while challenges include 
integrated coastal zone management, management of marine 
protected areas and gaps in information and knowledge. Since 
the main centres of economic activity and population are on the 
coast in the majority of West Asian countries, sea level rise and 

related impacts of coastal inundation and increased salinity 
of aquifers and soil are a real risk. Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar and 
the United Arab Emirates are the countries most vulnerable to 
sea level rise (AFED 2009). Significant warming of seawater 
due to the outflow of warm water from desalination plants may 
cause coral mortality, loss of biodiversity, depletion of fisheries, 
invasion of alien species and other environmental stresses. 
Given the rapid rates of change and the extent of pressure on 
the coastal environment, measures of biodiversity are not a 
clear indication of the background resilience of the system 
or the overall integrity of ecosystem function (Sheppard et al. 
2010; Price 2002).

Indicators to measure the progress of the selected policies 
include:
•	 marine	and	coastal	biodiversity	indices;
•	 level	of	compliance	with	national	legislation	related	to	

fisheries;

•	 trends	in	landings	of	marine	biological	stocks;
•	 funds	allocated	to	research	and	assessment	of	marine	

biodiversity; and

•	 levels	of	compliance	with	measures	to	protect	the	coastal 

and marine environment.

The recommended policies can be grouped into four clusters: 
•	 integrated	and	ecosystem-based	marine	planning	and	

management; 

•	 enhancing	protection	of	coastal	and	marine	ecosystems;	
•	 controlling	and	combating	marine	pollution;	and	
•	 fisheries	management.	

From within these clusters, three policies were selected that 
have a history of implementation in most West Asian countries, 
that show some degree of success in ensuring the sustainable 
development of the coastal and marine environment, and that 
can be replicated and transferred. The three selected policies are: 
•	 integrated	coastal	zone	management;	
•	 the	establishment	of	marine	protected	areas;	and	
•	 fish	stock	enhancement.	

Integrated coastal zone management
Integrated coastal zone management is a process of 
achieving sustainable development goals and objectives in 
coastal areas within the constraints of physical, social and 
economic conditions as well as within those of legal, financial 
and administrative systems and institutions, providing 
a cooperatively developed framework for the long-term 
conservation and management of coastal and marine resources 
(PAP-RAC 2011). One of its fundamental requirements is a strong 
set of policies for the management of the coastal environment 
and its resources, backed by appropriate legislation or a similar 
legal base. Many West Asian countries have developed strong 
policies and the legal base also exists in Lebanon, Qatar, Saudi 
Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Yemen (Tortell 2004). However, 
there appear to be some difficulties in moving on to the next 
step, which is implementation. Among the different policies 
and policy tools that form the framework of integrated coastal 

Kuwait’s heavily populated low-lying coast is particularly vulnerable to 
potential sea level rise. © Øystein Lund Andersen

zone management are an integrated coastal planning process 
backed by a planning/management authority, or its equivalent, 
and a coastal planning/management office; a coastal zone 
monitoring programme; an environmental impact assessment; 
and implementation of the Global Programme of Action for the 
Protection of the Marine Environment from Land-based Activities 
at a regional level.

It is important to mention that an integrated approach is 
essential if national and regional, rather than simply sectoral, 
objectives and targets are to be achieved. Integration is 
required between central and local governments; various 
sectors in government, administration and the community; 
and governments, civil society and private sectors. In addition, 
countries sharing the same water body need to adopt regional 
approaches for policy implementation.

Through the rational planning of activities, integrated coastal 
zone management facilitates the sustainable development of 
coastal areas by ensuring that the environment and landscapes 
are taken into account in harmony with economic, social and 
cultural development. Benefits include the preservation of 
coastal zones for current and future generations; ensuring the 
sustainable use of natural resources, particularly with regard 
to water; ensuring the preservation of the integrity of coastal 
ecosystems, landscapes and geomorphology; and preventing 
and/or reducing the effects of natural hazards and in particular of 
climate change. 

West Asia 391

The integrated approach improves coherence between public 
and private initiatives, and between all decisions made by public 
authorities at the national and regional levels that affect the use 
of the coastal zone. Related institutional strengthening can also 
help communities adapt to the impact of climate change. The 
region has recently witnessed a new trend in the integration of 
ecotourism policy in the framework of integrated coastal zone 
management in Jordan, with a project developed in 2010 by the 
Regional Organization for the Conservation of the Environment 
of the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden (PERSGA) and the Aqaba 
Special Economic Zone Authority, focusing on the enhancement 
of ecotourism based on coral reefs and other coastal habitats 
in the Gulf of Aqaba. Such a policy can enhance efforts to 
protect the coastal and marine environment.

Before an effective integrated resource management system 
can be established, some barriers need to be faced. The most 
salient of these can be overcome by the establishment of 
an appropriate management system and the development 
of environmentally sound policies for, amongst others, land 
reclamation, urbanization and fisheries. Many West Asian 
countries have significant reclamation activities with adverse 
impacts on coastal and marine ecosystems and their services. 
These activities sometimes aim to improve land availability, 
as in Bahrain (Figure 14.4), or to provide vast recreational 
opportunities. An effective integrated management policy that 
improves public awareness and enforces existing laws related

to the use and protection of natural resources can help to 
overcome these limitations.

Programmes for the integrated management of coastal zones 
can be replicated either under different sectoral programmes 
or within the framework of an ecosystem approach, or under a 
management authority or its equivalent, which would necessitate 
coastal planning offices. Many regional and international 
organizations are involved in the transfer of know-how and 
knowledge between different countries (Box 14.9).

Integrated management of the coastal and marine environment 
cannot occur under the current arrangements of many West 
Asian countries, where responsibilities and activities are 
divided between a number of ministers and organizations. 
Enabling factors include preparing integrated marine and coastal 
development plans that incorporate the principles of multiple 
uses and an ecosystem approach, establishing institutional 
arrangements for marine and coastal planning, enforcing the 
outcomes of environmental impact assessments, and building 
capacity for a better understanding of the marine environment.

Box 14.9 Coastal and Area Management Programme 
(CAMP) in Lebanon

The CAMP-Lebanon project, part of the Mediterranean Action 
Plan (MAP), was implemented within UNEP’s Coastal Area 
Management Programme. It aims to improve sustainable 
coastal management and integrates environmental concerns 
into development plans (Mehdi 2004). CAMP-Lebanon 
addresses the conservation of natural coastal resources in 
the area between Damour and Naqoura, an 8-km-wide strip 
of land, by applying concepts of sustainable development 
as well as methods for integrated coastal and marine 
management alongside economic and social development. 
The project area was defined at two levels:
•	 the	national	coastal	area	to	the	south	of	Beirut;	and
•	 the	three	municipalities	of	Damour,	Sarafand	and	

Naqoura as the operational area. 

Thematic activity on integrated coastal area management was 
split into several components:
•	 land-use	management;
•	 cultural	heritage	and	sustainable	development;
•	 the	status	of	environment,	agriculture	and	fishery;
•	 the	socio-economic	situation;
•	 a	legal	framework;	and
•	 a	national	strategy.	

The most important elements of CAMP-Lebanon have been 
developed and articulated in the national strategy for 
integrated coastal area management and the project has 
developed a crucial legal tool, the proposed law on integrated 
coastal area management.

Establishment of marine protected areas
Marine biodiversity in the region faces extensive threats including 
the unprecedented pace of recent construction along and off 
the coastline. Together with destructive and wasteful fishing, 
these developments seriously threaten coastal habitats in 
most West Asian countries (UNEP 2010). Introducing financial 
incentives through integrating the economic benefits of ecosystem 
services into development costs is one way to overcome marine 
biodiversity loss. Marine protected areas are another effective 
tool for biodiversity conservation, habitat protection and fisheries 
management, acknowledged at national, regional and international 
levels. Since 2009, most West Asian countries have had biodiversity 
strategies in place supported by UNEP’s implementation 
programme and projects funded by the Global Environment 
Facility (GEF), especially in Lebanon, Iraq, OPT, Syria and Yemen. 

Three policy options have been adopted at the national level to 
speed up the process of reaching agreed goals:
•	 rehabilitating	degraded	habitats	and	conserving	biodiversity;	
•	 documenting	marine	life	and	biodiversity;	and	
•	 establishing	multi-purpose	protected	areas	in	various	marine	

and coastal ecosystems.

Marine protected areas require a well-defined conservation 
plan backed by legislation, a monitoring programme to ensure 
sustainability, and effective partnership between different 
stakeholders, supported by research into best management 
practice by such regional marine and coastal programmes as the 
Regional Organization for Protection of the Marine Environment 
(ROPME) and the Regional Organization for the Conservation 
of the Environment of the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden (PERSGA). 
The benefits of establishing marine protected areas are the 
conservation and improvement of biological diversity; the 
maintenance of essential ecological process within the natural 
system; the sustainable management of marine renewable 
resources including fisheries; and the protection and restoration 
of degraded habitats while facilitating the implementation of an 
ecosystem approach (Box 14.10).

Fish stock enhancement
Another policy cluster addresses biodiversity conservation 
through integrated fisheries management, an initiative aimed 
at tackling the issue of how fish resources can best be shared 
between competing users within the broad context of ecologically 
sustainable development (Shing 2001). There are several marine 
fisheries management policies within the cluster, currently 
practised to overcome management obstacles and problems 
facing the fishery sector. 

Data clearly show very substantial declines in commercial fish 
over the past 10–20 years (Sheppard et al. 2010), while Bishop 
(2002) and Sheppard et al. (2010) have demonstrated a link 
between the permanent loss of inter-tidal and shallow sub-
tidal nursery grounds with declining fish and shellfish catches. 
Marine stock enhancement, an approach that addresses these 

Box 14.10 Marawah Biosphere Reserve, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates 

The Marawah Marine Protected Area, the largest in the region 
with a total area of 4 255 km², became the first UNESCO 
Marine Biosphere Reserve in the region in 2007. Marawah 
itself, just one of 20 islands that make up the protected area, 
is flanked by Jarnain Island to the north, Abu Al Abyad Island 
to the east, the mainland to the south and Sir Baniyas to the 
west. The protected area is a representative example of the 
Gulf region, containing coastal areas, salt flats (sabkhas), 
shallow waters and shallow islands as well as seagrass 
habitats. The island hosts a significant population of dugongs, 
four species of marine turtle, 70 species of fish, and coral 
reefs and expanses of mangrove (Avicennia marina) that are 
important habitats for many terrestrial and marine species. 

Resident and migratory bird species such as ospreys, sooty 
falcons and several tern species, are part of the ecosystem, 
with bottlenose and humpback dolphins also found in 
the surrounding waters, making the area important for its 
biodiversity. Preserving the natural diversity and quality of the 
coastal and marine environment is what the reserve aims to 
achieve. It has established a 12-member marine ranger force 
to carry out surveillance and control programmes, essential 
infrastructure has been procured and maintained, and the 
rehabilitation of a mangrove site on Marawah Island has 
begun. The island is also of great cultural and archaeological 
significance, with more than 20 sites dating back 7 000 years 
to the Stone Age (SCENR et al. 2008).

issues, involves a set of management measures for releasing 
farmed organisms to enhance or restore fisheries. Engineered 
artificial reefs, which help to restore lost or degraded marine and 
coastal environments, can also enhance re-stocking of depleted 
commercial fish and shellfish.

Such practices, including sea ranching, stock enhancement 
and restocking, are widespread, often controversial, and 
have varying levels of success (Lorenzen et al. 2010). Fish 
stock enhancement, one of the successful policies, involves 
the annual release of tens of thousands of fish fingerlings in 
different parts of the territorial waters. 

The benefits of this policy are mostly in rehabilitating depleted 
fisheries, and also include the potential to reduce the time 
needed to rebuild some severely overexploited ones or improve 
the productivity of other, healthy fisheries. Only if large-scale fish 
releases are completed and the effects on the fisheries measured 
and documented will it be possible to quantify and value the 
economic benefits of the programme.

Stock enhancement, which can be very costly and absorb major 
resources, is not a substitute for fisheries management (AFED 
2009). Understanding both the biology and the culture technology 
of a species is critical to the success of stock enhancement 
programmes, the impacts of which may be insignificant and 
can be extremely difficult to assess. If not carefully managed, 
stock enhancement programmes can affect the gene pool of wild 
stocks and there can be complications when exotic species are 
introduced as part of the enhancement programme.

The potential for restocking and stock enhancement stems 
mainly, but not entirely, from the development of technology to 
produce juveniles of a wide variety of coastal fish and shellfish in 
hatcheries (Bell et al. 2006). Restocking and stock enhancement

programmes, in which West Asian countries have developed 
considerable expertise, are applied in intricate human-
environment systems involving dynamic interactions between the 
resource, the technical intervention and the people who use it, 
making replication complex (Box 14.11).

Stock enhancement programmes should be considered within 
the broader issue of fisheries management (Shams and Uwate 

Bahrain is an island state and its people have a strong affinity 
with the sea. Landings of some preferred fish such as grouper 
have declined dramatically in the last 10–20 years. One 
successful management policy that is being followed on an 
annual basis is the enhancement of fish stocks, which have 
suffered over the years as too many fishers catch too many fish. 
In 1994, tens of thousands of orange spotted groupers were 
successfully released; in 1996 and 1997 stock enhancement 
activity focused on the release of yellow-finned black sea 
bream and sobaity sea bream.

Several fish species such as white-blotched grouper and 
striped grouper, parrotfish and sobaity sea bream were 
rarely seen in fish markets before the start of the release 
programme in 1994, but the annual release of different species 
has enabled the refinement of the technology and reduced 

mortality and costs. The General Directorate of Fisheries, for 
example, has recently made arrangements with Durat Al-
Bahrain, in the southwest of the Kingdom, to deploy different 
types of artificial reefs to be used for the release of sobaity sea 
bream and grouper fingerlings.

However, as a result of insufficient funding for the fish  
release programme, modern fish tagging technology could 
not be applied to assess its success. Some people, however, 
have reported large quantities of small groupers and sobaity 
and shaem sea bream in the market just after fish release. 
Additionally, in the post-release period, actual grouper 
landings were high. This suggests that the releases have 
had a positive impact on the fishery, especially on  
landings (Zainal and Abdulqader 2009; Shams and  
Uwate 1996).

1996). Enhancements affect complex fisheries systems and, to be 
successful, must contribute to a broad set of biological, economic, 
social and institutional management objectives (Lorenzen 2008), 
so it is important to compare the costs of the programmes with 
the benefits. Finally, public cooperation is very helpful.

CONCLUSIONS
Environmental policies in West Asian countries have been 
developed over the past two decades and continue to progress; 
however, they need to become proactive rather than reactive. 
Additionally, environmental governance, rather than merely 
focusing on environmental policies, needs to take account of 
societies’ common goals and engage with various stakeholders in 
the design and execution of policies. The integration of sectoral 
policies is also important. Regional environmental governance is 
crucial for the West Asia region as the countries share common 
environmental conditions. There is also a need for clear, integrated 
policies, not just targets, aimed at shifting the region from current 
long-established economic systems towards a green economy.

Failure to introduce sectoral policy integration, policy mixes 
and regional integration will intensify currently unsustainable 
consumption and production patterns, especially for energy, 
water, food security and marine resources, with the potentially 
grave consequences of natural resource depletion and increased 
pollution, which in turn impact human health and well-being. 

The region’s marginal biophysical characteristics, population 
growth, urbanization and socio-economic policies, coupled with 
high rates of natural resource consumption, are the main drivers 
of environmental problems. Insecurity and conflicts are also 
among the regional drivers of environmental degradation. These 
are further exacerbated by frequent droughts and climate change. 

There is a general lack of coherent environmental data and 
information tools in the West Asia region. The systematic 
collection, processing, analysis, production, dissemination 
and exchange of environmental information would lead to more 
robust decision making and proper policy formulation and 
implementation. Trends show the need to make use of additional 
measures to improve enforcement and compliance processes. 
Moreover, there is a significant need for regular environmental 
reporting in all West Asian countries as well as greater public and 
private participation (UNEP 2010).

The involvement of the public in the environmental regulatory 
systems remains low because people are neither well informed 
nor encouraged to participate. Although access to general 
environmental information has recently improved, much effort is 
still required to achieve real public participation in environmental 
management.

Several countries in West Asia undertake enabling initiatives to 
facilitate the implementation of green technologies to reduce 
pollution and waste, to conserve energy and to rationalize 
water use. Most of the countries have developed policies to 
integrate cleaner production concepts in the industrial sector 

and established centres to help build capacity. However, the 
effectiveness of policy implementation is unsatisfactory. 

Proper allocation of authority within environmental governance 
needs to be enhanced and environmental institutions 
empowered. Strengthening the role of various stakeholders, 
including non-governmental organizations, the private sector 
and local communities, would improve execution, monitoring, 
reporting and achieving the collective goals as well as increasing 
cooperation at national and regional levels, and would lead to 
better implementation of environmental policies.

Many policy options could be seen as inducing the necessary 
structural changes to achieve better environmental governance in 
the region. Such options include the integration of environmental 
impact assessment in decision-making processes and 
development plans, the decentralization and development of 
institutions, and improving access to environmental information 
to improve public engagement. 

The challenge for the water sector lies in achieving sustainable 
water development through balancing supply and demand, 
with priority given to meeting the MDG 7c targets. Water 
resources policy should be coordinated with agriculture, 
environment, housing, and social and economic policies to 
achieve internationally agreed goals. The updating of water 
legislation and strengthening of intra-institutional coordination 
mechanisms, the free dissemination of information and the 
enhancement of stakeholder participation are necessary to the 
comprehensive and integrated management of the water sector. 
Essential management measures include greater efficiencies in 
water use, especially in the irrigation sector; protecting water 
sources from pollution and depletion; and deploying adequate 
financial and qualified human resources. The integrated water 
resources management approach provides an innovative 
planning tool to overcome existing obstacles and address future

application of an integrated management approach can be

physical, social, economic and cultural settings.

Screening and analysis of policies implemented to prevent

Part 2: Policy Options

the enhancement of regional cooperation through projects to 
conserve natural resources, increase land productivity, and 
prevent and mitigate soil erosion and dust storms. Integrated 
land, agriculture and water policies include modern agricultural 
techniques, sustainable agricultural production systems and 
afforestation to achieve relative food and water security.

Policies focused on the energy efficiency of buildings have 
been successful in the development of green building codes 
and expanding the market for innovative green services and 
efficiency-oriented companies, which attract professional 
participation to improve practices. The public at large 
understands the policy concepts and has the awareness to 
implement efficient practices as long as the building fabric 
options and systems are economically justifiable and mandated 
by governments. Replication of building and systems energy 
policies has a high success rate due to the similarity of climates 
and needs, and the high level of motivation for increased 
development, innovation, and investment for the greening of the 
building sector by professional, private and government entities. 

Energy policies related to power generation have a more top-
down approach that relies on country goals to increase the 
share of energy production from clean sources. Decision-making 
tools to decide on the energy generation mix have to include 
environmental impact assessments. West Asian countries 
are looking at various options including nuclear energy, as 
renewable energy generation is still not seen as cost-effective 
compared with the conventional resources that are abundant 
in GCC. Energy policies cannot be developed independently of 
freshwater policies. The challenge lies in how to optimize the 
development of policies that address the demand of both energy 
and water at minimal cost to the environment. Cooperation 
between Arab countries to complement each others’ energy 
needs would have more success where alternative sources of 
energy generation are used.

Policies for oceans and seas are clustered around the 
integration of management tools in order to achieve sustainable 
development of the coastal and marine areas. West Asian 
countries should confirm their commitment to an ecosystem 
approach through continued support for the integrated 
management of the coastal and marine environment. To this 
end, policy implementation tools such as strategic social and 
environmental impact assessments should be considered during 
project planning. 

The development and improvement of management systems 
for marine protected areas and regional networks are important 
for conservation of the region’s biodiversity. Global climate 
change will exert additional impacts on the coastal and marine 
environment, and regional adaptation strategies should take 
into consideration the environmental, social and economic 
differences between countries. The region has a very high 
potential for the transfer of several policies to ensure the 
sustainable development of the coastal and marine environment 
of the West Asia region.

Main Messages 

The selection of freshwater, climate change and 
environmental governance as priorities by all 
regions suggests a recognition that these issues 
have reached a point of global importance requiring 
responses that could have relevance worldwide. 
Climate change exerts extreme pressure on ecological 
systems, including on freshwater by exacerbating 
problems of water supply and demand. Two regions 
considered climate change to be cross-cutting, and 
assessed how policies in each theme help to attain 
international goals related to climate change. 

While many of these policies are long-standing 
management concepts, their application can be 
innovative if certain principles are adhered to. This 
includes policies that are mutually reinforcing with 
positive impacts in more than one thematic domain, 
and policies that address drivers – as defined in 
Chapter 1. Concentrating on these deeper, underlying 
causes of environmental degradation will allow the 
goals and targets set out in international, regional 
and national agreements to be met in a more 
effective way.

There are common elements in successful policies 
across the regions. Tools such as integrated water 
resources and coastal zone management; the removal 
of environmentally harmful subsidies, especially 
on fossil fuels and/or carbon taxes; renewable 
energy, marine protected areas, and cross-boundary 
biodiversity conservation, are all examples of policies 
used in more than one region, but customized to 
each context. Formal, robust, and well-established 
governance mechanisms and structures at all 
governance levels are a necessary foundation for 
successful implementation of environmental policies.

The policies selected by the regions are successful 
because of some underlying principles. These 
include policies that are mutually reinforcing and 
have benefits across sectors, address drivers, invest 
in monitoring and evaluation to allow revision and 
enhance accountability, or involve multi-stakeholder 
participation at local, national and regional level.

There is sufficient experience to enable faster 
transfer and replication of several of the priority 
policies. This, however, would be greatly improved 
by the sharing of experiences between donor and 
recipient practitioners and stakeholders, learning 
the specific skills of how to assess potential policies 
for particular needs and how to adapt these to 
the selected situation, and establishing capacity 
and institutional development to support the 
enhancement and propagation of these skills.

Transboundary cooperation is important when 
natural areas are shared. It promotes understanding 
and the transfer of knowledge between neighbours, 
and leads to a collective response to shared 
problems, allowing new opportunities and  
ways of overcoming these common problems  
to be identified.

Improved environmental governance is needed if 
environmental degradation and the unsustainable 
use of natural resources are to be reversed. Critical 
components include multi-stakeholder support, 
raising public awareness among all stakeholders, 
stronger mechanisms for financial sustainability, 
enhanced institutional capacity, adequate legal 
frameworks and strong compliance mechanisms. 
Community leadership demonstrated, for example, 
in the formation of water maintenance trust funds 
or wetland management schemes provides local 
services, helps resolve inter-community conflicts, 
demonstrates the value of participation and learning, 
and provides income-generating opportunities. 

Policies that have proven successful can be analysed 
for their ability to leverage societal transformation. 
Understanding the potential of these policies, 
alone or in combination, could help facilitate 
transformative change and enhance the effect 
that policy makers have on reaching sustainable 
development objectives at local, national, regional 
and international levels.

INTRODUCTION
Humans have long been aware of the effects on their local 
environment of resource use, waste production and land use, 
but only in the last few decades has it been realized how such 
activities affect the global environment. In the past, when 
there were fewer humans and each used natural resources less 
intensively, the capacities of the atmosphere, land and water 
could carry the load of human consumption and production. But 
a significant proportion of the 7 billion humans alive today are 
actively exploiting the planet’s resources at accelerating rates 
and intensities that surpass the carrying capacity of the Earth’s 
systems (Krausmann et al. 2009; Liu et al. 2003; McNeill 2000). 
As mentioned in Chapter 1, the scale, spread and rate of change 
of global drivers are without precedent.

The concept of planetary boundaries was introduced by 
Rockström et al. (2009) to identify those key environmental 
processes that provide humanity with a safe operating space 
for well-being. Scientific analysis established nine planetary 
boundaries with approaching thresholds beyond which 
humans could not thrive in the Earth System. Of these nine 
thresholds, three may already have been passed: climate 
change, biodiversity loss, and the removal of nitrogen from the 
atmosphere (fixing) for use in fertilizers and weapons (Rockström 
et al. 2009). The concept of impending thresholds, tipping points 
and crossing boundaries are familiar to those who study complex 
systems (Limburg et al. 2002). Biologists and marine scientists 
term abrupt changes in the species that populate an ecosystem 
regime shifts (Kraberg et al. 2011; Rodionov and Overland 2005). 
Earth System scientists are currently debating the imminence 

of destabilization in various tipping elements affecting global 
climate (Lenton et al. 2008). A more in-depth discussion of the 
role of planetary boundaries can be found in Chapter 7.

This chapter provides a summary of Chapters 9–14 and 
aims to determine those approaches and policies that show 
promise for adoption and adaptation elsewhere. The outcome 
of this appraisal is to offer policy options that can help meet 
internationally agreed goals efficiently and effectively and also 
lead to international, regional and local co-benefits. It is useful 
to identify at which level the policies identified as promising are 
best suited to apply leverage (Chapter 16).

REGIONAL SUMMARY 
The selection of themes
The GEO-5 Introduction describes the process by which each 
region selected priority themes and internationally agreed goals, 
as well as the policy appraisal methodology by which promising 
policies were identified. During the consultations, some regions 
decided that certain themes cut across the priority environmental 
challenges that were selected for the region.

The selection of priority themes and goals, which was limited to a 
maximum of five or six for each region, provides a first indication 
of what is considered important (Table 15.1).

Different regions focused on different aspects of the same 
theme. For example, while only two regions selected energy as a 
priority theme (Table 15.1), three others – Asia and the Pacific, 
Europe, and Latin America and the Caribbean – included energy

in their selection of policies that hold promise for meeting the 
climate change goal. In Latin America and the Caribbean, policies 
on wastewater treatment and coastal zone management are 
included in the water theme, while policies on coastal and marine 
protected areas are included in the biodiversity theme.

The selection by all regions of freshwater, climate change and 
environmental governance as priorities suggests recognition that 
these issues have reached a point of global importance requiring 
responses that could have relevance worldwide. 

Africa
For the first time in 2009, Africa’s total population exceeded 
1 billion, of which 395 million (or almost 40 per cent) lived in 
urban areas. Africa should prepare for a total population increase 
of about 60 per cent between 2010 and 2050, with the urban 
population tripling to 1.23 billion during this period (UN-Habitat 
2010). Africa’s cities are characterized by extremes of prosperous 
centres and poor, informal settlements, and many governments 
struggle to provide social services including access to water, food 
and energy security, and management of environmental risks. 
Climate change and other adverse environmental change may 
accelerate urbanization (UN-Habitat 2010) and further strain 
governments’ ability to cope (Mohamed-Katerere 2009).

The importance of transboundary natural resource policies 
is increasingly recognized in Africa as an essential strategy 
to enable integrated environmental management, economic 
integration, conflict resolution, and equitable socio-economic 
development. The integrated water resources management 
of the Senegal River Basin provides a practical example of 
transboundary cooperation that strengthens political links 
while enhancing agricultural productivity and food security. 
This initiative also improves transport, allowing year-round 
navigation, and ensures a reliable source of hydroelectricity.

Much of the growth in many of Africa’s fastest-growing cities is a result 
of the expansion of informal settlements, which offer its residents 
limited access to basic infrastructure. © iStock/Steven Allan

Part 2: Policy Options

The achievement of policy goals in a given sector or region is now 
understood to be closely linked to potential improvements and 
co-benefits in additional areas (Chapter 9). For example, under the 
Sustainable Land Management Programme in Ethiopia, 177 local 
watersheds are being protected to enhance land productivity 
and rural development, simultaneously strengthening resilience 
in downstream communities and countries (TerrAfrica 2009). For 
nations faced with limited resources, maximizing policy synergies 
helps deliver social, ecological and economic benefits, reduces 
trade-offs, and provides multiple paths for addressing common 
drivers and pressures. 

The establishment of networks of marine protected areas creates 
additional benefits and provides more effective management 
opportunities than reliance on isolated ones. Regional 
cooperation is essential to sustain effective marine protected 
area networks. Addressing challenges – such as disparities in 
governance, institutional structures, wealth distribution, social 
capital and the collection of ecological data – and strengthening 
enabling conditions help to establish networks.

The effective use of tools and mechanisms to track and monitor 
environmental performance and change increases the capacity to 
respond effectively and efficiently to new challenges, including 
risks such as extreme events. For example, East Africa’s 
Intergovernmental Authority on Development established a 
Conflict and Early Warning and Response Mechanism that helps 
communities plan their pastoral activities and food production 
better, building resilience against threats from famine and inter-
community conflicts over grazing and crop production.

Regional cooperation, community-driven strategies and public-
private partnerships can support learning, improve sustainability 
and encourage ecosystem approaches. The recently adopted 
Mangrove Charter for West Africa, which is complemented 
by country-specific action plans, is an example of regional 
cooperation. The relative success of a community-based 
mangrove management project in Cameroon demonstrates the 
value of participation and learning for successful adaptation 
(Ajonina et al. 2009). The restoration of 5 hectares of locally 
significant mangroves in Mauritius, financed by a local bank 
with technical assistance from government and implemented 
by a non-governmental organization and the local community, 
illustrates how partnerships between government, the private 
sector and civil society can help preserve natural resources 
and provide a practical climate change adaptation strategy that 
helps local people cope better with extreme events such as 
storm surges (ADD 2011, 2009). An island-wide survey has been 
undertaken to identify potential areas for replication.

Human rights protection is increasingly recognized as critical in 
strengthening human well-being while delivering environmental 
benefits. South Africa’s Free Basic Water Policy, for example, 
benefits many impoverished households by guaranteeing access 
to 25 litres of water per person per day for domestic use within 
200 metres of their homes. This strategy reduces the burden 
on women as well as providing health benefits (Mehta 2005). 

The policy also strengthens municipal institutions and helps to 
reduce surface water pollution from domestic sources by placing 
authority at the local level.

Asia and the Pacific
The Asia and Pacific region has become a global engine of 
economic growth, but with large intra-regional differences. 
China is the world’s largest carbon dioxide (CO2) emitter, while 
most Pacific island nations are among the smallest. Water 
endowments range from the highly arid temperate zones and 
water-stressed small island states to Himalayan snowfields and 
abundant tropics. There is a wide diversity of environmental 
governance systems and mechanisms. The region’s challenges 
include lifting millions of people out of poverty, navigating the 
turbulence of globalization, and dealing with some of the most 
polluted landscapes on Earth. 
 
As the region is the fastest growing source of greenhouse 
gas emissions in the world, decisions to implement policies 
supporting carbon neutrality, renewable energy, conservation, 
and efficiency are crucial to the success of global efforts to 
address climate change. Countries in Asia and the Pacific, 
such as China, India and Indonesia, are reducing and 
removing fossil fuel subsidies with the objectives of reducing 
state budget burdens, preventing the use of public funds to 
support the wealthiest and those responsible for the greatest 
energy consumption, ensuring fairness for alternative energy 
development, and reducing environmental damage and 
contributions to climate change (IEA et al. 2010).

Of the ten countries in the world that are most at risk from 
climate change impacts, six are in the Asia and Pacific region. 
Key areas for action include integrating climate change 
adaptation and disaster risk reduction, mainstreaming 
adaptation concerns into development policies and plans, 
promoting ecosystem-based adaptation, and developing 
climate-proofed infrastructure. In the Maldives, policy research 
continues on possible relocation sites for populations displaced 
by sea level rise. At the same time, policy implementation 
increases resilience of individual islands by offering support 
with measures for afforestation, improving drainage, 
supplementing natural ridges, replenishing beaches, cultivating 
mangroves and fostering coral reef health (GEF 2009).

The Asia and Pacific region faces significant water-related 
challenges. Integrated water resource management planning, 
balancing water supply and demand through coordination 
among users, improved water quality management, appropriate 
pricing and multi-stakeholder participation, represent essential 
strategies to solve water problems in the region. In China, the 
Yellow River was cut off from the sea for 226 days in 1997, after 
episodic flows with shorter cut-offs in preceding years. In 1998, 
China initiated a programme restricting water withdrawals 
from the river and assigning quotas to users, with compliance 
enforcement measures including fines for exceeding withdrawal 
quotas (NDRC 1998). Since 2000, the river has flowed all the 
way to the sea. 

For the Maldives, adaptation is a multi-dimensional goal that aims 
to increase the resilience of its vulnerable island systems against 
climate hazards and risks, and to achieve sustainable development.

The emerging economies of Asia and the Pacific are exerting 
immense pressure on natural resources and ecosystem services. 
Although progress has been achieved through expanding 
protected areas, conserving species, addressing direct 
drivers of biodiversity loss, implementing community-based 
management and innovative financing, the scale of these efforts 
is insufficient to address current biodiversity and habitat losses. 
However, some successes can be replicated. In Viet Nam, forest 
ecosystem service payment schemes charge tourism operators 
and downstream water and power utilities for upstream water 
regulation, soil conservation and landscape preservation. 
Payments for the protection of 210 000 hectares of forest went 
to forestry businesses and forestry management boards, as well 
as to 9 870 households comprising mostly ethnic minorities 
(Winrock International 2011).

Many of the policy successes observed in the region are context 
specific. Therefore, policy transfer and emulation initiatives require 
careful analysis of the underlying political, cultural, economic 
and social contexts and their influence on policy implementation 
and success. Creating the necessary enabling environment is as 
important as selecting the right combination of policies. 

Europe
The pan-European region is very diverse, with 37 national 
languages spoken in its 50 European countries (Nations Online 
2011), a range of socio-economic and political systems, a variety 
of physical environments and differing means of environmental 
governance. Europe’s land area of 23 million km2 (GEO Data Portal 
2011; FAO 2010) is characterized by a diversity of (agri)cultural 

Regional Summary 403

landscapes, urban agglomerations, extensive coastal zones, 
forests and undisturbed pristine areas. Of the nearly 833 million 
Europeans, about half live in Western Europe, while some 72 per 
cent of the entire region’s population lives in urban areas (GEO 
Data Portal 2011; UNDESA 2010).

This region has formal, robust, and well-established governance 
mechanisms and structures to address environmental issues. For 
more than four decades, the European Union (EU) has developed 
and implemented environmental policies. That process has 
evolved from targeted policies and single-issue instruments in 
the 1970s and 1980s, through diffuse policy integration and 
public awareness in the 1980s and 1990s, to policy coherence 
and other systemic approaches since the late 1990s. 

At the pan-European scale, the Environment for Europe ministerial 
process, initiated in 1991, reflects this process of environmental 
governance. Both EU and non-EU European countries are on 
schedule to meet their Kyoto targets on cutting greenhouse gas 
emissions, and are among the major donors to international efforts 
to address climate change worldwide. The EU’s Emissions Trading 
System (ETS), which covers about 40 per cent of EU emissions, 
provides valuable implementation and design lessons for other 
regions. For 2009, the EU carbon trading market was estimated 
to be worth more than US$118 billion per year, part of a global 
carbon-credit market estimated at US$144 billion, with the volume 
of emissions covered reaching 6.3 billion tonnes (EC 2009a, 
2009b; Ellerman and Buchner 2007). 

Two other promising policy options in the European region 
concern the development of renewable energy and adaptation 
strategies. Feed-in tariffs (FIT) for renewable energy systems 
were established in Germany more than 20 years ago and 
are being emulated successfully both throughout the EU and 
globally (Jänicke 2011). In its adaptation strategies, the EU 
is moving away from short-term disaster responses, aiming 
for long-term adaptation measures and policies that will be 
implemented at national and local levels focusing on land-use 
planning, agriculture, water management and biodiversity/nature 
conservation, as well as building adaptive capacity and taking 
action to increase resilience to climate change.

Although air quality in Europe has improved in recent decades, 
there are still some outstanding issues, particularly in relation 
to urban air quality, human health, air pollutants and ecosystem 
degradation. The efforts of the Convention on Long Range 
Transboundary Air Pollution (CLRTAP) and its pan-European 
scientific network have been pivotal in documenting air quality 
issues and in building credibility, shaping policies and ultimately 
monitoring trends in air quality improvement. Many of these 
policies and initiatives have strong replication potential – 
particularly where rapid industrialization is degrading air quality.

European governmental institutions also play a vital role in 
solving freshwater issues, while integrated water resources 
management is becoming a key guiding mechanism for decision-
making. The transboundary nature of most European rivers 

calls for close cooperation between user countries through the 
creation of river basin management plans (UNECE 2011). Also, 
information provision and market-based instruments, such as 
water metering and incentive-based water pricing, show potential 
as policy approaches that can yield 20–40 per cent reductions in 
household water use.

Waste volumes continue to grow despite strong regulation. In 
Eastern Europe, a legacy of industrial wastes from the Soviet era 
still poses significant ecological problems (Devyatkin 2009). 
Policy focus is evolving to make producers responsible for 
waste reduction, reuse, and recycling and by encouraging the 
development of new technologies and greater reliance on life-
cycle approaches. Legislation has been developed for specific 
wastes such as electrical and electronic equipment, various 
chemical substances, and toxic and radioactive by-products.

Europe is at the forefront of multi-national conservation efforts. 
Through Natura 2000, a coherent network of protected areas, 
biodiversity monitoring, and conservation activities has been 
established. However, biodiversity loss remains a problem due 
to continuing landscape, ecosystem, and habitat degradation. 
Nevertheless, initiatives such as Forest Europe are addressing 
biodiversity conservation, climate change, and the protection 
of freshwater resources and have already contributed to the 
increase of the total forest area in European countries (Forest 
Europe et al. 2011).

Latin America and the Caribbean
The 33 countries of Latin America and the Caribbean vary 
significantly in size and economic development. The region 
includes both Brazil, the seventh largest economy in the world 
(The Economist 2011) and small island developing states with 
open and fragile economies (Rietbergen et al. 2007). Rich in 
natural resources, the region is home to approximately 23 per cent 
of the world’s forests and 31 per cent of its freshwater resources. 
Although these resources are not evenly distributed, the overall 
richness and economic importance of the region’s ecosystems and 
its natural capital are undeniable (UNEP 2010). With 79 per cent 
of its population living in towns and cities (UN-Habitat 2010), 
the region is one of the most urbanized in the world. It faces 
challenges in providing its burgeoning towns and cities with safe 
water and sanitation, and in addressing air pollution and the 
contamination of its freshwater, oceans and seas. 

The performance of the region’s environmental institutions is 
currently constrained not by the absence of laws but by a paucity 
of political will, limited procedural continuity and inadequate 
enforcement instruments. The region also requires greater 
financial resources to facilitate sustainable management efforts 
and to ensure conservation of biological resources. 

Achieving a more sustainable model of development requires 
improved national and regional strategies to facilitate 
cross-sectoral policies, at relevant scales, that can address 
environmental and economic issues simultaneously. To improve 
governance, active community participation and a high level of 

404

Part 2: Policy Options

inter-institutional cooperation are also needed. The combination 
of these approaches can help improve environmental problems 
while enhancing human well-being. These types of initiatives are 
also crucial to address the most serious challenges faced in the 
region: poverty and inequality.

Careful analysis and evaluation of social needs, at local 
and regional levels, facilitates the implementation of more 
effective environmental initiatives that can also address social 
development. For example, the innovative transport initiatives 
implemented first in Curitiba, Brazil, and subsequently in Bogotá, 
Colombia, illustrate that well-designed projects can yield multiple 
environmental and social benefits, such as climate mitigation 
and improved mobility options (WRI 2010). 

Integrated water resources management promotes the coordinated 
development and management of water, land and related 
resources. If carefully designed and implemented, it can also 
maximize economic and social welfare in an equitable manner 
without compromising the sustainability of vital ecosystems. 
 
Green financing options and mechanisms to ensure better 
inclusion of key stakeholders are also recognized as important 
approaches to help reduce environmental degradation and 
threats to the region’s biodiversity. For example, the Fund for 
the Protection of Water (FONAG), a trust fund to which water 
users contribute, is used to co-finance the rehabilitation and 
conservation of 65 000 hectares of watersheds that supply water 
in Quito, Ecuador, and surrounding areas. Similar funds have been 
developed in Colombia and Peru (Cisneros and Lloret 2008).

Since the 1960s, arable land has increased by 83 per cent in 
South America, 46 per cent in Africa and 36 per cent in Asia, 
coinciding with significant deforestation in all three regions 
(IPSRM 2010). In 2009, more than 280 000 Latin American 
and Caribbean producers managed 23 per cent of the world’s 
organically farmed land, with the highest regional shares in 
Dominican Republic and Uruguay (Willer and Kilcher 2011). 
The overall area of land used for agriculture in South America 
increased by 20 per cent between 1970 and 2008, while 
livestock production grew by 37 per cent (FAO 2010).

Based on a review of Latin America and the Caribbean’s current 
and past experiences, the three land management policies 
considered the most favourable to attain the goals set out 
in the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation (WSSD 2002) 
include multi-scale land-use planning, sustainable agriculture 
and livestock production, and the recovery of degraded lands. 
Payment for ecosystem services, sustainable forest management, 
and policies related to integrated land management and water-
use plans address multiple themes including climate change, 
biodiversity and water goals. 

Efforts to strengthen technology networks and knowledge flows 
are needed to improve the management of natural capital and 
the use of land-based and coastal and marine resources. Such 
capacity-building efforts are also important to help improve 

policies that promote the conservation of biodiversity and water, 
and climate change mitigation and adaptation, while helping to 
yield more effective development results (CCCCC 2011).

North America
North America is considered a global economic leader, although 
changes in regional demographics, rapidly emerging global 
economies and resource constraints all challenge the country’s 
provision of public goods and services. At the same time, 
fragmented governance, policy instability, lack of clear targets 
and science policy, and the dilemma of whether to address 
global issues rather than seeking local solutions, hamper the 
achievement of environmental goals (Chapter 1).

In North America, there has been a recent trend emphasizing the 
success of market-based instruments over the use of regulations 
and standards in environmental management. However, there is 
a need for additional empirical data to show the actual impacts 
of these market-based instruments. Such policy options are 
best approached in a complementary manner, as market-based 
instruments need a clear and strong regulatory framework to work 
well. Furthermore, accountability and transparency can increase 
their environmental effectiveness while helping to ensure fair and 
equitable social outcomes. 

Integrated water resources management in combination with 
technological instruments and economic incentives has proved 
effective in addressing complex water resource challenges. 
Integrated strategies have great potential for replication, 
provided that effective coordination and implementation 
mechanisms accompany them. They require a coordinated effort 
between stakeholders at multiple geographic and political 
scales, as well as adequate scientific evidence and monitoring 
to ensure that appropriate action is taken in response to altered 
water regimes resulting from climate change and increasing 
demand. The adoption of policies for maintaining the availability, 
sustainable use and fair allocation of freshwater to meet the 
needs of both humans and nature must be embedded into an 
holistic approach at the scale of a hydrological basin.

The Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River Basin Sustainable Water 
Resources Agreement of 2005, involving eight US states and two 
Canadian provinces, provides a framework for each state and 
province to manage and protect the basin as a whole. The Great 
Lakes and St. Lawrence Cities Initiative includes the objective 
that by 2015, all participating cities of the basin reduce water 
use by 15 per cent below 2000 levels. By 2010, almost half of 
the 33 participating cities had collectively achieved a 13 per cent 
reduction conserving a total of 330 million m3 of water.

The pricing of externalities and integrated land management 
show potential to increase the sustainability of land-use 
practices in North America. Jurisdictions throughout the region 
have adopted many of these policy instruments to different 
degrees. For example, in British Columbia, Canada, resource 
companies, environmental groups and coastal First Nations 
have successfully carried out an ecosystem-based integrated 

Regional Summary 405

land-use planning exercise, the 2006 Great Bear Forest 
Agreements, through a collaborative process (McGee et al. 2010). 
Taxes and other incentives in the United States have increased 
the total area conserved by local, state and national land trusts 
to around 15 million hectares. Programmes on payment for 
ecosystem services have permanently preserved another 92 
million hectares in the United States.

At the state or provincial level, North America’s growth of 
renewable energy technologies and the associated rise in the 
proportion of renewable energy in the region’s energy mix can 
be traced to policy goals supported by market mechanisms such 
as feed-in tariffs. Greatly increasing the use of renewable energy 
in North America is technically feasible and can provide multiple 
benefits including reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, lower 
energy prices and decreased market volatility, while creating new 
employment and economic opportunities. 

Carbon taxes can also contribute to energy efficiencies. The 
Canadian provinces of Quebec and British Columbia imposed 
carbon taxes in 2007 and 2008, respectively. Quebec’s tax is 
very low but British Columbia’s revenue-neutral scheme is more 
ambitious, starting at US$10 per tonne emitted in 2008 and 
increasing to US$30 per tonne in 2012. Addressing drawbacks 
typically associated with carbon taxes such as comprehensive 
coverage combined with targeted tax reductions, and reducing 
potentially large adaptation costs for carbon-intensive industries, 
appears to have helped it gain citizen acceptance. 

West Asia
The predominantly arid and semi-arid region of West Asia 
covers about 4 million km2. Rainfall is scant but with significant 
spatial and temporal variability. Water scarcity and frequent and 
persistent droughts are common, making water the region’s most 
precious resource. The region also faces major environmental 
challenges in the need to address land degradation and 
desertification; increasing fossil-fuel-based energy production 
and use with high inefficiencies in generation, distribution and 
end use; and the conservation and sustainable use of marine 
and coastal resources. Climate change is becoming one of the 
region’s main problems, with potentially adverse impacts on the 
economy and human well-being.

West Asia has made considerable progress in environmental 
governance. For instance, the League of Arab States established 
the Council of Arab Ministers Responsible for the Environment 
(CAMRE) as a high-level institution to ensure proper coordination 
of environmental policies across the region. CAMRE aims to 
identify major environmental problems, set priorities and 
address issues related to sustainable environment. However, 
deteriorating environmental trends indicate a need for using 
additional policy instruments such as incentives, monitoring 
mechanisms, economic and environmental assessment tools, 
environmental education, and public awareness strategies.

Countries in West Asia rely heavily on regulatory strategies 
rather than market-based instruments. Although new initiatives 

to introduce policy mixes aimed at achieving higher levels of 
integration between different sectors do exist, they remain 
modest. As an illustration, for the last four decades water policies 
have mostly focused on supply strategies aimed at overcoming 
shortages through technical solutions including desalination. 
This supply-focused approach, enabled by the availability of 
strong financial resources within key countries, specifically the 
Gulf Cooperation Council States, has resulted in good progress in 
meeting the Millennium Development Goal on water supply and 
sanitation, particularly in urban areas (UNDESA 2011). 

The ongoing prevalence of unsustainable patterns of demand 
and consumption is nevertheless resulting in depletion of water 
resources and widespread deterioration in water quality, a 
situation that also increases regional tension over shared sources. 
Integrated water resource management represents a promising 
approach to achieve resource sustainability (CEDARE and AWC 
2004). In addition, fair pricing of water services is becoming 
widely understood as crucial for achieving better demand 
management. In Saudi Arabia, the government has launched a 
number of measures to reduce consumption by the agricultural 
sector. It initially limited domestic food production by decreasing 
the subsidy on diesel fuel and is gradually reducing the 
government’s own purchase of local wheat. In 2009, it set a target 
to gradually eliminate domestic wheat production over an eight-
year period, while increasing incentives and loans for installing 
modern irrigation systems, providing subsidies for animal feed 
imports, banning the export of fodder and establishing strategic 
food reserves (AFED 2010; Hussain et al. 2010).

Land degradation and desertification are linked with a number 
of challenges including food production, biodiversity loss, 
deterioration of water resources and climate change. National 
action plans to combat land degradation and desertification 
therefore need to be better integrated with sustainable 
approaches to natural resources, biodiversity conservation 
efforts and climate change initiatives (Ministry of Municipalities 
Affairs and Land Use Planning 2010).

Many West Asian nations are currently implementing strong 
coastal development plans. However, regional authorities 
still need to confirm their commitment to protect coastal and 
marine ecosystems through the application of ecosystem-based 
management. The protection of marine and coastal areas from 
climate change, oil spills and land-based sources of pollution 
still represent important challenges for this region. The 
development and implementation of strategies such as crisis 
management and risk assessment represent very significant 
tools for climate change adaptation and for the protection of 
marine environments. The establishment of marine protected 
areas and the application of integrated fisheries management 
represent promising solutions to enhance marine biodiversity 
conservation (Sheppard et al. 2010; Price 2002).

West Asia has vast and valuable renewable energy resources 
but the energy sector is still characterized by heavy reliance on 
fossil fuels, which results in adverse environmental impacts and

and environmental justice; capacity development; and improved 
goal setting and monitoring systems.

Climate change 
A major concern for many countries is how to build resilience, 
especially in the most vulnerable communities, to climate change 
impacts already set in motion by past greenhouse gas emissions. 
Policies are oriented to climate change mitigation and adaptation 
and disaster risk reduction.

Promising climate change policies already under implementation 
include the removal of environmentally harmful subsidies, especially 
on fossil fuels; carbon taxes; forestry incentives for carbon 
sequestration; emissions trading schemes; climate insurance; 
capacity building and financing; and climate change preparedness 
and adaptation such as climate proofing infrastructure.

Energy
Legislative and institutional frameworks for developing 
sustainable energy systems are needed to achieve global goals.

Successful policies include increased international cooperation in 
the area of transfer and application of energy-saving technologies; 
promotion of energy efficiency; increased use of renewable 
energy; feed-in tariffs; restriction on fossil fuel subsidies; low 
emission zones within cities; and research and development, 
especially on batteries and other forms of energy storage.

Air pollution
Europe was the only region to select air pollution as a priority 
theme and perform an appraisal of policy options.

Successful policies include fuel and vehicle emission standards; 
control of industrial pollution through technical emission 
controls, best available techniques, fuel switching and reduced 
sulphur content in liquid fuels; and local air quality management 
plans including adequate monitoring and information systems 
and appropriate institutional mandates for local authorities.

Land
Land policy has a role in preventing environmental degradation 
and its social and economic costs. 

Clear and protected rights, and effective rules defining access 
and regulating land, water and other natural resource use, are 
all essential means of ensuring long-term sustainable land 
and resources management. Successful policy options include 
integrated watershed (catchment) management; resource-
efficient urban growth; protecting prime agricultural land; 
improved forest management; payment for ecosystem services 
and REDD+; and agroforestry and silvo-pastoral practices.

Freshwater
The equitable and sustainable management of freshwater is a 
major challenge for all water users, with most governments, from 
the local to the international level, facing the need to realign 
the availability of water with human and economics-based

high carbon intensity. Policy efforts to promote energy efficiency 
and renewable energy to mitigate climate change are evolving. 
However, to achieve global goals and to develop sustainable 
energy systems, the region still needs to strengthen its legislative 
and institutional frameworks. In particular, the building sector in 
West Asia is a major energy consumer, largely due to a significant 
demand for air-conditioning. A switch to green building practices 
is emerging through the adoption of building energy efficiency 
codes, which, along with renewable energy development, 
represents great opportunities for the entire region (Ministry  
of Public Work and Housing 2009).

COMMONALITIES 
GEO-5’s regional assessments, presented in Chapters 9–14, 
identify policy responses and instruments based on best 
practice. Common threads can be traced between and among the 
regions with particular policy approaches proving successful in 
a number of cases. Those policy responses adopted successfully 
in more than one region have a greater likelihood of accelerating 
achievement of internationally agreed goals. 

Successful policy tools and instruments 
Environmental governance
At the regional and global levels, environmental governance has 
evolved into a set of organizations, policy instruments, financing 
mechanisms, rules, procedures and norms that regulate the 
processes of environmental protection. 

Absent or inadequate governance is one of the major issues in 
sustainable development, and many proactive efforts are being 
made to overcome these barriers, including multi-level/multi-
stakeholder participation; increased introduction of the principle 
of subsidiarity; governance at local levels; policy synergy 
and removal of conflict; strategic environmental assessment; 
accounting systems that value natural capital and ecosystem 
services; improved access to information, public participation 

demand at levels that also maintain ecosystem integrity and 
environmental sustainability. In large part, this realignment 
requires the integration of environmental considerations, 
alongside domestic, agricultural and industrial requirements, into 
the drafting and implementation of national and international 
policies and legislation. Given that environmental considerations 
have historically been deemed secondary or even of no priority 
in decision-making related to the allocation and management 
of freshwater resources, the realignment will have to focus, at 
least initially, on expanding the attention paid to environmental 
concerns in the existing people-centred processes (UNEP 2010).

Policies identified as successful across the regions include 
integrated water resources management; the conservation and 
sustainable use of wetlands; promotion of water-use efficiency; 
water metering and volumetric-based tariffs implemented at a 
national or sub-national level; recognizing safe drinking water and 
sanitation as a basic human right/need; and effluent charges.

Oceans and seas
Polices such as integrated coastal zone management and marine 
protected areas, and economic instruments such as user fees 
have provided a level of success in terms of management.

Biodiversity
Biodiversity policies promote the protection, conservation and 
sustainable use of biologically diverse ecosystems and habitats. 
In doing so, they create significant public benefits and contribute 
to social well-being.

Successful policy instruments include market-based instruments 
for ecosystem services, including payment for ecosystem 
services and Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest 
Degradation (REDD+); increasing and improving the management 
of protected areas; establishing transboundary biodiversity 
and wildlife corridors; community-based participation and 
management; and sustainable agricultural practices.

Chemicals and waste
Important international legal instruments and frameworks 
have been adopted with regard to the sound management of 
hazardous chemicals and wastes, including such policies as 
the registration of chemicals; extended producer responsibility; 
product redesign and design for the environment; life cycle 
analysis; reduce, reuse and recycle – the 3Rs – alongside cleaner 
production; national and regional hazardous waste treatment 
systems; and control of inappropriate export and import of 
hazardous chemicals and waste.

Applying policies in a more effective way
Many of the policies selected as promising are based on well-
studied and accepted management concepts such as integrated 
water resources and coastal zone management, and protected 
areas. However, some common conclusions were identified 
across the regions, indicating that the application of these 
management concepts can be innovative if certain principles 
are adhered to.

as possible before the remaining water – or effluent – is discharged 
back to the environment. © Christian Uhrig/iStock

Cross-cutting policies across themes and sectors 
The selected policy options were often identified as being 
promising because they are mutually reinforcing, with positive 
impacts in more than one thematic domain. 
•	 “It	is	important	to	maximize	opportunities	by	focusing	on	
options that are mutually reinforcing and cross-cutting.” 
(Chapter 9 – Africa)

•	 “The	coherent	application	of	effective	policies	across	themes	
and sectors can bring major benefits in terms of an improved 
physical environment and a healthier population.” (Chapter 11 – 
Europe)

•	 “To	be	sustainable,	the	region’s	natural	capital	needs	to	be	

managed in an integrated fashion across sectors.” (Chapter 12 – 
Latin America and the Caribbean)

•	 “Failure	to	introduce	sectoral	policy	integration,	policy	mixes	
and regional integration will intensify currently unsustainable 
consumption and production patterns, especially for energy, 
water, food security and marine resources, with the potentially 
grave consequences of natural resource depletion and 
increased pollution, which in turn impact human health and 
well-being.” (Chapter 14 – West Asia)

Addressing drivers
There is increasing awareness among practitioners of a need 
to shift attention away from the effects of environmental 
degradation and instead focus on the underlying drivers. 
•	 “Policy	responses	are	beginning	to	shift	from	a	focus	on	

environmental impacts to addressing the key drivers through 
market- and information-based approaches.” (Chapter 10 – 
Asia and the Pacific)

•	 “Until	policies	begin	to	address	some	of	the	deeper,	

underlying causes of environmental degradation – or drivers 

– countries are unlikely to meet the goals and targets set 
out in international, regional and national agreements.” 
(Chapter 12 – Latin America and the Caribbean)

Monitoring, evaluation and accountability
Monitoring and evaluation can be used to improve policy design, 
increase the accountability or ownership of stakeholders and 
identify promising practices that can be applied subsequently 
or in other country settings.
•	 “Investing	in	monitoring	and	evaluation,	as	well	as	social	
learning, supports the revision and modification of policy 
responses. Strong accountability helps secure government 
and private-sector commitment to implementation and 
to achieve agreed outcomes (Najam and Halle 2010). 
Developing performance indicators rather than effort-based 
indicators, such as the number of meetings held, improves 
clarity about how and to what extent the purpose of the 
policy is being achieved (Najam and Halle 2010). Strong 
and effective national and sub-regional reporting systems 
help hold implementing agencies to account and provide an 
opportunity to document successes, which in turn set the 
basis for up-scaling and replication.” (Chapter 9 – Africa)
•	 “Improved	monitoring	and	data	collection,	and	access	to	
information and legal redress, have the potential to alter 
the drivers of environmental change and unsustainable 
development.” (Chapter 10 – Asia and the Pacific)

•	 “Enabling	conditions	that	would	increase	policy	success	

and replication include more efficient monitoring systems.” 
(Chapter 11 – Europe)

•	 “Performance	indicators	are	necessary	to	evaluate	policy	

progress and clearly identify successes and shortcomings.” 
(Chapter 13 – North America)

•	 “The	systematic	collection,	processing,	analysis,	production,	

dissemination and exchange of environmental information 
would lead to sound decision making and proper policy 
formulation and implementation.” (Chapter 14 – West Asia)

Transboundary cooperation
Natural areas shared by neighbouring countries are not only a 
common treasure, but also a common responsibility. They can 
be either a source of conflict or a source of cooperation and 
prosperity. 
•	 “Cooperation	has	been	shown	to	be	effective	for	achieving	

sustainable management, including policy options 
for transboundary coastal and land-based resource 
management, and where there are multiple stakeholders. 
This has improved equity, enhanced skills sharing and 
reduced conflict.” (Chapter 9 – Africa)

•	 “Efforts	to	enhance	the	sustainability	of	forests	through	

management face a lack of national capacity and awareness, 
and intensifying competition in international forest product 
markets. There is therefore an urgent need for transnational 
coordination to address common and cross-border issues 
(Hogl 2002).” (Chapter 11 – Europe)

•	 “Cooperation	is	an	important	element	in	improving	

sustainability in the region. Cooperation between its 
countries will facilitate the sharing of information, expertise 

and technology transfer, the lack of which may currently 
limit countries in moving to more sustainable paths of 
development. It could also help to improve the management 
of transboundary ecosystems and species.” (Chapter 12 – 
Latin America and the Caribbean)

Multi-stakeholder participation at local and national levels
The benefits of involving stakeholders in decision-making 
processes have been acknowledged. They include opportunities 
to share views, needs and knowledge; build consensus; enable 
participants to influence outcomes; and build commitment and a 
feeling of ownership to enhance and ensure implementation. 
•	 “Several	of	the	options	presented,	including	sustainable	

land management, show that a high degree of participation 
at local and government levels helps to ensure relevance, 
with good outcomes for strengthening sustainability. 
Decentralization and devolution policies, including in 
community-based resource management, have achieved 
positive outcomes for communities and for the environment.” 
(Chapter 9 – Africa)

•	 “Successful	implementation	of	policies	requires	the	

establishment of a planning framework for adaptive and 
integrated management of water resources, under which 
appropriate pricing and multi-stakeholder participation 
are essential. Governance improvements are critical to 
enhanced accountability as a means of achieving sustainable 
development.” (Chapter 10 – Asia and the Pacific)

•	 “Enabling	conditions	that	would	increase	policy	success	

and replication include a more active civil society engaged 
through awareness raising and strong multi-stakeholder 
agreements.” (Chapter 11 – Europe)

•	 “The	standard	governance	principles	and	values	of	

transparency, accountability, equity, sustainability and 
inclusive participation of all stakeholders are fundamental for 
strengthening governance frameworks.” (Chapter 12 – Latin 
America and the Caribbean)

•	 “Active	stakeholder	involvement,	with	explicit	discussion	of	
issues, improves decision making and acceptance, offering 
advantages over top-down planning, which often lacks public 
support and understanding.” (Chapter 13 – North America) 
•	 “Environmental	governance,	rather	than	merely	focusing	on	
environmental policies, needs to take account of societies’ 
common goals and engage with various stakeholders in the 
design and execution of policies.” (Chapter 14 – West Asia)

CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITES 
Traditionally, policy analyses have been conducted in the context 
of a specific plan, programme or project at the local or national 
level, focusing on economic and social costs and benefits and 
involving specific stakeholder groups. But policy analysis now 
faces new challenges as rules and norms adapt to changing 
expectations (Hajer 2003). The GEO-5 policy mandate aimed to 
extend the scope of analysis and appraisal to identify successful 
environmental policies in the regions and to highlight their 
potential to speed up the achievement of internationally agreed 
goals. The analysis is intended to provide policy makers with 
promising avenues for exploration.

Regional Summary 409

It is not certain whether the policies identified and appraised are 
the optimal choices with respect to the selected international 
goal, although there is evidence of their effectiveness. 
Furthermore, clusters of policies were identified, not just 
individual ones, acknowledging that most policies are 
implemented as part of a complementary package. Whether 
a policy could be effective in a different context or on a 
different scale is uncertain: for many policies, direct evidence 
of the specific reasons for their effectiveness is limited, as is 
evidence of the potential for their transferability and replication. 
Undoubtedly, political will remains an essential ingredient for 
success. However, direct causality is always difficult to isolate in 
dynamic systems such as societies. Inconvenient variables can 
be difficult to eliminate, and convenient ones usually cannot be 
introduced spontaneously. So experimentation and observation 
must continue despite inherent problems.

Information and indicators
Investing in and generating environmental knowledge and 
translating it into information that can be used in governance 
and policy development are essential for management success 
(Adger et al. 2005), and require a better interface between 
science, policy makers and communities. To influence policy 
and decision making effectively, environmental information 
should be transformed into scientifically derived, easily 
understood indicators that convey clear messages to policy 
makers and the public (UNESCO-SCOPE 2006; Cimorelli and 
Stahl 2005). 

Policy instruments designed to increase accountability and 
transparency seek to make information on environmental 
performance and the impacts of resource use more widely 
available, facilitating decision making and mobilizing a variety 
of stakeholders. Relevant information and indicators also help 
in monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of policies and 
determining whether they allowed management approaches to 
adapt to new conditions – these are important elements of good 
environmental governance. At regional and sub-regional levels 
mechanisms for sharing information and knowledge could be 
better utilized.

Environmental impact assessment for individual projects, 
cumulative impact assessment for series of projects, and 
strategic environmental assessment for policies, plans and 
programmes all provide essential information (World Bank 
2006). Documented cases of policies that appear to have made 
a contribution to achieving environmental goals can also be 
valuable. The promising policies described are illustrated by 
case studies, which provide insights into the context within 
which they were successful. 

Transboundary and regional cooperation
Environmental problems do not respect borders. The 
transboundary nature of environmental degradation is the result 
of scale, as pollution or damage affect larger and larger areas. 
Solving transboundary environmental problems can provide an 
opportunity to establish regional cooperation. 

Addressing shared environmental problems through regional 
cooperation can support the transfer of innovative solutions 
based on common characteristics of terrain, climate, economic 
activities and history, among others, which increases the 
likelihood of success. Transboundary approaches often enhance 
cooperation and reduce conflict by facilitating dialogue, 
establishing networks and encouraging learning and knowledge 
sharing. This helps create the political stability needed for 
economic and development cooperation. 

Other benefits of cooperation are an augmentation of national 
efforts, the transfer of capacities and conservation efforts 
involving several stakeholders across borders. The key challenges 
are sustainability, the differing capacities of the institutions 
involved and the political nature of cooperation whenever 
sensitive sovereign issues arise.

Chapters 9–14 offer many examples of successful transboundary 
initiatives: 
•	 In	Africa,	although	there	are	significant	variations	in	focus,	

structure, delivery and scope, the rapid increase in transboundary 
natural resource management demonstrates that this policy, 
despite some challenges, has high potential for replication 
and for managing Africa’s diverse shared ecosystems.

•	 In	Asia	and	the	Pacific,	transboundary	collaboration	fosters	

the cooperation of national institutions to the benefit of 
multiple countries, as demonstrated by several examples 
involving cross-boundary interest in protecting areas with 
high levels of biodiversity such as the Greater Mekong sub-
region, the Terai Arc landscape in India and Nepal, Sulu-
Sulawesi marine areas and the Coral Triangle.

•	 The	transboundary	nature	of	most	European	rivers	calls	

for close international cooperation, and integrated 
water resources management is increasingly the guiding 
mechanism for implementation.

•	 In	Latin	America	and	the	Caribbean,	transboundary	

cooperation and integration in the energy sector have been 
shown to increase electricity supply, widen coverage and 
enhance system functionality.

•	 The	International	Watersheds	Initiative,	which	was	conceived	

by the governments of Canada and the United States, 
promotes the establishment of watershed authorities and 
facilitates integrated transboundary watershed management.
•	 In	West	Asia,	there	are	conflicting	national	interests	in	forging	

equitable sharing agreements for transboundary resources. 
These issues, however, could be addressed through 
integrated water resources management supported by strong 
commitment by decision makers to place water high on the 
political agenda.

Challenges specific to each region influence policy 
approaches
Each region reflects varying characteristics – population, area, 
level of internal cohesiveness regarding shared history and 
culture, language, wealth distribution and education. Questions 
of political will, economic capacity, history and other intangibles 
persist, with the regions weighing these differently.

Part 2: Policy Options

In Africa, population growth, rapid urbanization, climate change, 
unsustainable development choices and weak governance persist 
as critical challenges to achieving both the environmental and 
the social aspects of important regional goals. Addressing human 
well-being was taken as a point of departure for strengthening 
environmental policy and implementation. The support of 
donors has been crucial to the implementation of some policies. 
The principles of the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness – 
ownership, harmonization, alignment, management for results 
and mutual accountability – define collaboration with donors 
and are designed to ensure that aid supports agreed government 
priorities and uses, and strengthens, government systems rather 
than developing parallel institutions.

The Asia and Pacific region has become a global engine of 
economic growth, but this success has come at the cost of some 
of the planet’s most threatened ecosystems. Many of the policies 
being adopted in the region had their origin and initial trials in 
other regions, often Europe and the United States. The failure to 
implement many of these policies successfully may stem from 
the assumption that if a policy works in a developed country 
then it should also work in a developing one. For example, the 
strong command-and-control policy regime to manage air and 
water pollution in the United States, involving standard setting, 
permits and prosecution of offenders, tends not to work as well 
in the developing countries of Asia and the Pacific (AECEN 2004). 
A policy regime built around voluntary compliance, the social 
pressures of naming and shaming polluters, and compensation 
where appropriate may be more applicable for the socio-cultural 
context of the region, although measures of effectiveness require 
further analysis.

In Europe, concerns about long-term threats to the environment 
and human health persist, the latter especially for its large 
urban population (EEA 2010). Despite some successes in 
decoupling environmental pressures from economic growth, 
Europe’s environmental footprint remains disproportionately 
high due to the continued unsustainable use of natural 
resources, both within and outside the region, to satisfy the 
high consumption and production level of its inhabitants 
(Chapters 1–7) (EEA 2010). To deal with these trends an 
integrated policy approach is required, for which strong 
governance mechanisms need to be in place. Given that Central 
and Western Europe in particular have a dense network of 
political boundaries, a regional focus to tackle environmental 
issues is necessary, with focus on transboundary as well as 
global environmental decision making. Regular monitoring, 
reporting and assessment required by legislation are an integral 
part of EU environmental governance.

Latin American and Caribbean countries face many challenges 
in managing their rich natural resources. Population growth, 
as well as unsustainable global and regional production and 
consumption patterns, drives the increasing demand for and 
extraction of raw materials and other natural capital (Chapter 1). 
This has led to the extensive conversion of natural environments 
to productive systems, with impacts on the region’s biodiversity. 

To be sustainable, the region’s natural capital needs to be 
managed in an integrated fashion across sectors. To respond to 
the complex nature of the region’s environment, its opportunities 
and challenges, policies should be designed and implemented 
in ways that transcend the traditional compartmentalized, 
sectoral approach. This will help the region deal with some of 
its persistent environmental and associated socio-economic 
problems, including poverty, inequity and social conflict.

In North America, changes in regional demographics, rapidly 
emerging global economies and resource constraints all 
challenge the countries’ provision of public goods and services. 
At the same time, fragmented governance, policy instability, lack 
of clear targets and science policy, and the dilemma of whether 
to address global issues rather than seeking local solutions, 
hampers the achievement of environmental goals (Chapter 1). 
Federal governments are no longer the primary leaders in setting 
the policy agenda or devising innovative policy instruments, yet 
they remain essential to the ultimate success of those policies, 
help ensure harmonization across jurisdictions and prevent the 
development of environmental inequities. In addition, there is 
a strong tendency to favour market-based instruments because 
of early successes, and to overlook traditional regulatory 
instruments. Finally, relative federal disengagement has opened 
the door to policy initiatives and innovations at sub-national 
levels, by states and provinces or municipalities, as well as to 
regional transboundary cooperation. The latter is extensive and 
continues to expand, and its dynamics are further supported by 
the Commission for Environmental Cooperation, which oversees 
the environmental accord of the North American Free Trade 
Agreement (NAFTA).

The drivers of environmental change in West Asia are linked to 
peace and security, demography and the state of the economy. 
The international desire to secure valuable energy resources 
and disputes, including current political conflict, play a major 
role in ongoing environmental degradation. Environmental 
damage is escalating and the number of displaced people 
is increasing, straining the environment and contributing to 
the degradation of land and water resources (UNEP 2010). 
Although environmental policies in the region have developed 
over the past two decades and continue to progress, they 
need to become proactive rather than reactive. Additionally, 
environmental governance, rather than merely focusing on 
environmental policies, needs to take account of societies’ 
common goals and engage with various stakeholders in the 
design and execution of policies. The integration of sectoral 
policies is also important. Regional environmental governance 
is crucial for the region’s countries share many common 
environmental conditions. 

Challenges in policy replication
There is a degree of scepticism as to whether a policy can be 
successfully reproduced and applied in different circumstances 
and for different stakeholders with different needs and 
expectations. The differing governance contexts and enabling 
environments in a region as diverse as Asia and the Pacific, for 

Regional Summary 411

example, may be barriers to adoption. However, as suggested 
in Chapter 10, there is sufficient experience with several of the 
priority policies analysed to justify faster replication.

The Asia and Pacific region (Chapter 10) considered the following 
factors when evaluating the potential for replication of policies:
•	 how	many	countries	have	already	implemented	such	policies;
•	 how	quickly	the	policies	have	been	adopted	by	multiple	

countries since their first introduction;

•	 how	easily	the	private	sector	has	been	convinced	that	the	

policies are not harmful to their businesses; and 

•	 how	the	policies	have	contributed	co-benefits	that	made	

them even more acceptable.

Part of the above analysis relates to the enabling and/or 
impeding factors that have led to the success or otherwise of 
specific policies. Europe (Chapter 11) identified the following 
enabling conditions for policy success and replication:
•	 more	policy	coherence,	streamlining	and	simplified	

procedures that enhance cost efficiency and effectiveness;

•	 more	efficient	monitoring	systems;
•	 stronger	long-term	commitment	on	the	part	of	politicians 

and governments;

•	 stronger	enforcement;
•	 transnational	coordination	to	address	common	and	cross-

border issues; 

•	 stronger	private-sector	involvement	by	creating	and	making	

better use of markets; and

•	 a	more	active	civil	society	engaged	through	awareness	raising	

and strong multi-stakeholder agreements.

The Latin America and Caribbean region (Chapter 12) has 
developed and implemented good examples of policies and 
approaches, usually at national and sub-national levels, that 
offer opportunities for replication both within and outside 

the region. Their characteristics usually include the effective 
incorporation of scientific information, knowledge and best 
practice, links across sectors, strong governance mechanisms, 
stakeholder participation, and political will and support.

The potential for transferability and replication of policies 
identified in North America (Chapter 13) is not straightforward 
and is dependent on context and specific instrument design. 
For example, the institutional framework of the North American 
electricity grid is highly fragmented, while many other countries 
have nationally owned networks (Willrich 2009). Denmark, 
France, Germany, Italy and Japan all have experience with 
feed-in tariffs at the national levels, while the United States 
and Australia have experience of production tax credits and 
renewable portfolio standards (IEA 2011). Policies on feed-in 
tariffs and renewable energy portfolio standards are in force in a 
variety of jurisdictions including Canada, China, Kenya, Portugal 
and Uganda (IEA 2011). Statistically, correlations demonstrate 
that the policies are effective, particularly in the case of feed-in 
tariffs (Haas et al. 2011). Direct causal evidence of effectiveness 
of other policies, however, is limited, as is evidence of their 
potential for transfer to and replication in other jurisdictions 
(Carley 2009; Doris et al. 2009).

In West Asia (Chapter 14), an excellent policy in one country does 
not usually stand alone and, as such, cannot easily be transferred 
or successfully replicated in its original form (UN ESCWA 2007). 
New circumstances, new management and various interdependent 
problems such as poor and low implementation capacities, lack 
of financial resources and marginalized local stakeholders, can 
make many successful programmes lose their effectiveness when 
replicated. The Council of Arab Ministers Responsible for the 
Environment (CAMRE) played, and continues to play, a major role 
in the coordination of environmental policies of the Arab countries 
at regional and global levels and has ensured a certain level of 
replication of environmental policies among West Asian countries.

Part 2: Policy Options

On the other hand, examples of successful replication from within and 
across regions provide possible tools for ensuring further success. 
Sharing experiences between practitioners and stakeholders may 
be a first step to a better understanding of the specific conditions 
in which a policy has been successful, and whether it could be 
replicated in another context, and to what extent.

Compliance and enforcement
However admirably designed, sensitively implemented and wisely 
administered, policies emerging from internationally agreed goals 
must be enforced to ensure continuity and accountability, but 
decision makers rarely give sufficient priority to this. Political will 
and leadership are required at all levels of implementation and 
enforcement. Compliance regimes can be more effective if the 
authority with responsibility is clearly identified and transparency 
is maintained to allow both higher levels of government and 
citizen-stakeholders to understand where the enforcement falls 
short. In this way, policy success is achievable.

Future work
Efforts to make the greatest possible use of quantitative evidence 
of policy effectiveness have highlighted opportunities for future 
work. In particular, there is a great need for governments and 
organizations to increase policy monitoring, for further research 
into policy effectiveness, and for the development of assessment 
methodologies that take greater account of synergistic policy 
effects and feedbacks.

PLANETARY POLICY PERSPECTIVES 
The policies presented in GEO-5 can be analysed for their utility 
to leverage societal transformation. Understanding the potential 
of these policies, alone or in combination, could help facilitate 
transformative change and enhance the effect that policy makers 
have on reaching sustainable development objectives at local, 
national, regional and international levels. 

Feedback and adjustments – managing markets
These include price adjustment and other market instruments 
that are intended to reduce burdens and provide signals that 
correct or reinforce patterns of behaviour. 

Example 1: Volumetric-based tariffs and water metering in 
Armenia (Chapter 11)
•	 Metering,	cost-recovery	tariffs	and	proper	pricing	structures	

stimulate more responsible water use while generating funds 
for the maintenance of the supply system.

•	 Various	studies	reveal	that,	on	average,	if	individual	metering	

systems are in place, reductions of 10–40 per cent can be 
achieved in household water use (Inman and Jeffrey 2006; 
Scheuer 2005).

involvement accompanied by investment and management 
efficiencies. As a result, the quality and reliability of water 
delivery improved.

Example 2: Carbon taxes in British Columbia (Chapter 13) 
•	 The	revenue-neutral	carbon	tax	in	British	Columbia	phased	

in rate increases starting at a modest US$10 per tonne of 
CO2-equivalent in 2008, increasing at a rate of US$5 a year 
thereafter to US$30 a tonne in 2012. 

•	 The	tax’s	revenue	neutrality	is	achieved	by	allowing	tax	

reductions for businesses as well as for poorer sections of 
society who also receive payments.

•	 The	tax	applies	to	emissions	from	fossil	fuels,	accounting	for	
approximately 70 per cent of the province’s total emissions 
(emissions from fossil fuels exported from British Columbia to 
other jurisdictions are exempt). 

•	 Addressing	the	drawbacks	typically	associated	with	carbon	

taxes may have enhanced the acceptability of British Columbia’s 
policy. This includes mitigating or eliminating the potentially 
regressive nature of carbon taxation by its comprehensive 
coverage combined with targeted tax reductions, and 
reducing potentially large adaptation costs for carbon-
intensive industries through a gradual phase-in of the tax.

Rules and incentives – state action
The creation and administration of rules is a key policy leverage 
point, as these have direct influence on and power over the 
actions of individuals and groups. 

Example 1: The Free Basic Water Policy of South Africa, allowing 
households to benefit from free, secure access to water (Chapter 9)
•	 The	South	African	constitution	provides	a	right	of	access	
to sufficient water, implemented through the Free Basic 
Water Policy. Many impoverished households benefit from 
secure access to at least 25 litres of water per person per day 
within 200 metres of the household for domestic use (Mehta 
2005). This is in line with the World Health Organization’s 
recommendation for minimum consumption, though it does 
not cover broader health and livelihood needs.

•	 Positive	outcomes	include	a	saving	of	the	time	and	effort	
women and girls spend collecting water, freeing them to 
engage in other activities, removing the need to resort to 
unprotected water sources and reducing vulnerability to 
water-borne disease (Mehta 2005). In addition, citizens 
directly attribute such policies to good governance, and this 
in turn supports long-term political stability.

•	 A	major	challenge	for	the	policy	is	to	strike	a	balance	between	

the human benefits and the cost (DWAF 2002). However, 
improvements in human well-being are seen as outweighing 
the associated costs (Stalk 2004). 

•	 Failure	to	provide	the	legally	guaranteed	quantity	has

on flat-rate calculations. The massive process of introducing 
individual metering became a trigger for a chain of water 
sector improvements, all backed by a legal, regulatory 
and institutional framework that enabled private-sector 

•	 Critical	enabling	factors	include	addressing	cost	recovery,	

identifying target groups, ensuring financing, managing 
demand and facilitating the expansion of infrastructure.

Example 2: Energy conservation in buildings in Kuwait (Chapter 14)

increased, particularly in the past two decades. As all 
electricity generation depends on fossil fuels, power plants 
consume about 55 per cent of Kuwait’s total primary energy. 
In addition, 85 per cent of electrical peak power and 60 per 
cent of the country’s total annual output is used for air-
conditioning and lighting in buildings.

•	 The	Ministry	of	Energy	in	Kuwait	launched	its	energy	code	

for buildings in 1983 with a set of mandatory standards and 
regulations to enhance energy conservation and decrease the 
progressive negative impacts on the climate.

•	 The	main	objectives	of	the	building	code,	which	is	applied	to	
new and retrofitted air-conditioned buildings, are to decrease 
the capacity of air-conditioning systems and to reduce peak 
power demand by introducing smaller units.

•	 Implementation	of	the	energy	code	has	saved	Kuwait	nearly	

US$10 billion over the past two decades.

Mindsets – civil society
Measures that shift the paradigms guiding individual behaviour 
create shared mindsets that translate into vision, goals and 
collective action. 

Example 1: Payment for ecosystems services – including 
the costs of environmental and resource use in the value of 
ecosystems (Chapter 12)
•	 In	general	terms,	payment	for	ecosystem	services	schemes	
offer incentives, usually monetary, to individuals to protect 
and ensure the delivery of key ecosystem services at the 
local, national and regional levels.

•	 The	mechanism	can	address	many	of	the	driving	forces	of	

biodiversity loss, especially habitat loss and unsustainable 
land management, as it usually aims to protect and/or 
rehabilitate natural vegetation. 

•	 Payment	for	ecosystem	services	can	be	used	in	conjunction	
with other policies such as protected areas, integrated water 
resources management, conservation and restoration of 
water-supplying ecosystems, sustainable forest management, 
small-scale agro-ecological systems and the recovery of 
degraded lands.

•	 Lack	of	information	on	economic	valuation	highlights	the	
need to invest more in research and further the scientific 
understanding of local environmental conditions.

Example 2: Participation in the management of natural resources 
in India and Nepal (Chapter 10) 
•	 In	India,	about	22	million	hectares	of	forests	are	included	
in the Joint Forest Management programme, under which 
more than 100 000 committees formed by forest-fringe 
communities protect patches of state-owned forest, receiving 
a share of forest resources in return (MOEF 2009a). 

•	 In	conjunction	with	stringent	legislation	prohibiting	the	use	

of forest land for non-forestry purposes, forest cover has 
stabilized after decades of rapid deforestation (MOEF 2009b). 

•	 Additional	incentives	for	participation	have	been	created	by	
a constitutional amendment that mandates decentralization 
and devolution of power to local authorities at village, 

•	 In	Nepal,	more	than	14	000	community	forest	user	groups	
have access to fuelwood and fodder, and are additionally 
provided with income-generating opportunities (DoF 2011).

CONCLUSION
This summary shows that in response to common concerns in 
the regions over freshwater, climate change and environmental 
governance, there are a variety of successful responses 
ranging from local actions to guarantee water quality, through 
transboundary agreements to tackle concerns affecting shared 
resources, to national programmes designed to shift the 
behaviour of whole economic sectors. 

Improvements in governance are crucial if global goals are to be 
achieved, requiring the integration of sustainability concerns 
across all policy areas. Key elements, highlighted by the 
regions, include better enforcement at all appropriate levels of 
government, improved monitoring and data collection, greater 
access to information, increased multi-stakeholder participation 
and capacity building. 

Whether a policy is replicable in a different context and on a 
different scale remains uncertain. Direct evidence of specific 
reasons for effectiveness is limited, as is evidence of the 
potential for transferability. The effectiveness of a specific policy 
or instrument and its potential to be scaled up or implemented 
elsewhere depends on significant context-specific variables, 
on the nature of the specific environmental issue, and on the 
existence of detailed and rigorous analyses of factors associated 
with its effectiveness in terms of behavioural change.

Nonetheless, common elements can be seen among the regions, 
with particular policy approaches proving successful in a number 
of places. Some of these, such as integrated approaches to 
water resources and coastal zone management or the creation 
of protected areas, draw on well-established concepts. But 
significantly, where policies have been successfully replicated, 
there is evidence that their application has taken significant 
account of local cultures, conditions and needs.

Responses at the local, national, regional and international 
levels interact and generate incremental, structural and 
transformational change. There is no universal solution to 
environmental degradation and a range of responses is required 
to address the diversity of regional needs. However, on issues 
of common global concern, coordination, participation, and 
cooperation are vital for meeting jointly internationally agreed 
goals and targets, while also addressing the capacity deficits of 
a range of countries. 

Better progress in achieving internationally agreed goals can 
be made if policies apply leverage at the most advantageous 
place. Examples of promising policies identified in the regional 
chapters can be found at all leverage levels, namely feedback 
and adjustments in managing markets; rules and incentives in 
state action; and mindsets at the level of civil society.

Regional Summary 419

Main Messages 

Meeting an ambitious set of sustainability targets 
by the middle of the century is possible but current 
supporting policies and strategies are not adequate 
to achieve this. Scenario studies show that without 
greater efforts to implement appropriate short-term 
policies, to shift investments to achieve necessary 
long-term structural changes, and to introduce 
behavioural transformations, it will not be possible to 
meet sustainability targets. These relate to international 
agreements on environmental protection and human 
development for issues like atmosphere and climate 
change, land and food security, water and biodiversity.

Transforming both consumption and production is 
important. Scenario studies suggest that targets can 
be met, but only if measures are taken to influence the 
levels and patterns of consumption and production. 
Most current policies focus on changes in production 
processes to achieve targets, but fail to address 
consumption. However, changes in consumption 
levels and patterns have great – but as yet unrealized 
– potential to reduce environmental pressures.

Effective implementation of wide-ranging technical 
and policy measures needs to be supported by a 
shift in underlying motivations and value patterns. 
Changes need to be both short and long term, and 

to combine technology, investment and governance 
measures along with lifestyle modifications 
grounded in a mindset shift towards values based on 
sustainability and equity. They also need to reflect 
regional differences and priorities. Technical measures 
alone are unlikely to be enough, and will not have the 
required level of societal support if not accompanied 
by transformations at all leverage points.

Accomplishing such complex transformations 
requires a gradual but steadily accelerating 
transition process. Some successful policy 
innovations are already happening, but need  
to be mainstreamed to be more effective. There  
is also a need to stop doing the things that pull the 
Earth System towards unsustainability. At the same 
time, it is important to provide resources, build 
capacity and create an enabling environment 
in a way that is consistent with visions of a 
sustainable world.

Broad-based social contracts grounded in jointly 
developed visions of a sustainable future would 
help to bring key stakeholders on board. The 
transition requires a high degree of consensus 
and coordination of action between social actors – 
governments, the private sector and civil society.  

420 Part 3: Global Responses

To ensure coherence, contextually sensitive 
transition pathways could be developed as joint 
visions of the future. These can be agreed on as 
informal or formal social contracts that respect the 
requirement to assure sustainable access to the 
resources necessary for human well-being. 

The transition process needs to be based on 
adaptive management. Uncertainties play a key role 
in the problems of the Earth System. As a result, 
management should be based on learning-by-doing 
processes, periodic reassessment based on new 
learning, and a great diversity of measures. This will 
provide better insurance against wholesale failure on 
critical issues – due either to inherent uncertainties 
or inadequate implementation – and be mutually 
strengthening as well.

There is a need for clear long-term environment  
and development targets and for stronger 
accountability in international agreements.  
Given that environmental and societal Earth  
System changes can be slow, long-term visions  
and goals – expressed as social contracts – 
could help focus investments and technology 
development, induce societal change, and engage 
other actors in society. 

Scenarios and Sustainability Transformation   421421
Scenarios and Sustainability Transformation  

INTRODUCTION
The nature and scale of changes described in Part 1 indicate that, 
without additional policies, the global environment will degrade 
further – from a situation that already raises considerable 
concern. A crucial question, therefore, is how to halt and reverse 
such trends. 

While previous Global Environment Outlook (GEO) reports have 
explored several scenarios looking at very different futures 
(UNEP 2002, 2007), the emphasis of GEO-5 is on the choices and 
strategies that could, from 2012, lead to a sustainable future. 
This is advanced by looking at two very different storylines based 
on a review of existing scenario studies: 
•	 a	view	of	the	world	in	2050	assuming	business-as-usual	

paths and behaviours – “conventional world” scenarios; and
•	 an	alternative	that	leads	to	results	consistent	with	our	current	

understanding of sustainability and agreed-upon goals and 
targets on the road to 2050 – “sustainable world” scenarios. 

A key difference between the two is how deeply transformation 
occurs, supporting the emergence of alternative development 
trajectories (Figure 16.1).

The ambitious goals of this systemic transformation require 
increasing the power of collective thinking, creativity and 
coordination. Cultivating profound long-term change is neither 
a linear nor a simple process, especially in complex dynamic 
systems that often exhibit non-linear behaviour or tipping 
points (Lenton et al. 2008; Folke et al. 2002; Levin 1998). For 
this reason, knowledge of the component parts of a system, 
their relationships, interactions and emergent behaviour can 
help policy makers understand, anticipate and strategize 
outcomes for the longer run, even when evidence of those 
changes may not be immediately apparent. Sustainable world 
scenarios represent and require many fundamental shifts in

society-environment interactions. These scenario outcomes 
are designed to be consistent with the best available science 
on the Earth System and the aspirations for environment 
and sustainable development manifested in multilateral 
agreements. They combine the effects of mainstreaming 
promising measures that already exist with change at 
progressively deeper structural levels. 

A system is a set of things – here, people and ecosystems in the 
Earth System – that interact with one another within a defined 
boundary, and that produce their own pattern of behaviour 
over time. Complexity theory shows that small, calculated, 
strategically applied actions can effect great change. In a 
complex system, leverage points are those where the outcome is 
disproportionate to the input. Identifying and acting on effective 
leverage points is especially difficult in cases in which casting 
off old paradigms is involved, but once a leverage point has 
been pushed in the right direction, the resultant change can be 
particularly lasting and profound (Meadows 1999).

“Magical leverage points are not easily accessible, even 
if we know where they are and which direction to push 
them on. There are no cheap tickets to mastery. You have 
to work at it, whether that means rigorously analyzing a 
system or rigorously casting off your own paradigms and 
throwing yourself into the humility of Not Knowing.”

(Meadows 1999)

Figure 16.2 depicts the transformative layers where leverage 
points may be found. The more embedded drivers are in the 
system, the more enduring and profound the change needs to 
be: shifting mindsets is at the core of transformation because 
it translates into visions, goals and collective action. Changing 
rules and incentives is literally a game changer in the pursuit 
of transformation, because the right incentives can create 
structural change and influence key drivers. The outer layer of 
transformation involves creating and listening to feedback and 
making adjustments to environmental pressures to maintain 
progress towards sustainability.

Shepherding a complex dynamic system through transition is 
not a linear or unidirectional process, and progress or setbacks 
occurring in each layer continuously influence the others. Thus a 
policy approach that diversifies strategy across all the layers of 
transformation presents a diverse and resilient portfolio for using 
leverage to its greatest advantage. The result is an integrated 
policy that produces both short-term and profound long-term 
system shifts by cultivating and targeting ever deeper system 
change over time, while monitoring it as well as feeding it with 
successes at more superficial levels. Clearly, producing these 
outcomes requires an ability to accept some uncertainty, while 
also holding a strong focus on integrating and documenting 
progress towards a clearly articulated vision of success. The 
section on visions, goals and targets on the road to 2050 
articulates a vision of a desired state of the environment, with 
goals and targets based on existing international agreements.
The section on sustainability pathways reviews existing

scenarios to provide an outlook for the drivers of environmental 
change and the pathways that society could follow on the 
road to 2050 to achieve goals and targets. Over the last few 
years, a large number of scenario-based assessments of global 
environmental problems and human development have been 
published, including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change (IPCC) climate assessments (Nakicenovic and Swart 
2000), the Global Environment Outlook reports (UNEP 2007, 
2002), the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA 2005a), the 
International Assessment of Agricultural Science and Technology 
Development (IAASTD 2009b) and the World Water Development 
Reports (UNESCO 2009, 2006). Most of these used an explorative 
approach with widely diverging scenarios that assess what might 
happen in the future. Van Vuuren et al. (2011a) discuss many 
of the assessments and highlight emerging commonalities. 
Generally, the scenarios explore a wide range of possible 
outcomes but, importantly and by design, almost none 
involves meeting sustainability targets – or sets them out as 
an objective. In contrast, some visioning exercises carried out 
by various organizations, such as the World Business Council 
on Sustainable Development (WBCSD 2010), the International 
Geosphere Biosphere Programme (Jäger and Cornell 2011) and 
UNEP’s Green Economy Report (UNEP 2011c), have tried to do so. 

The section on advancing sustainability explores strategic 
elements that have the potential to advance the transition 
onto pathways consistent with visions of a sustainable world. 
Changing the current unsustainable course demands a scale 
of effort without precedent in human history (Steffen et al. 
2005). Meeting this challenge will require a diverse portfolio of 
strategies and measures, partly as a form of insurance against 
failure, but also to reflect the different and dynamically changing 
condition of individual countries and ecosystems around the 

world (Innes et al. 2005; Speth 2005). Taking into account 
recent scientific advances in understanding the functioning and 
governance of closely coupled human systems and ecosystems, 
this section provides guidance for developing response measures 
and strategies at the sub-global level. A strategic element 
identifies visioning and the ability to build social and political 
consensus around visions of sustainable-future outcomes as 
essential but underrated aspects of sustainable development 
governance (Costanza 2000; Meadows 1996). Society-wide 
relearning and the phase-out of unsustainable policies and 
practices are discussed, coupled with the redirection of 
resources towards high-leverage intervention points, including 
those that better align peoples’ mindsets with sustainability and 
redefine the common meaning of progress as something broader 
and more meaningful than gross domestic product (GDP). Finally, 
the need for approaching the transition as an adaptive learning 
process to build resilience (Loorbach 2007; Holling 2001;  
Lee 1993) is identified. While providing guidance at the sub-
global level, these strategic elements also serve as a starting 
point for the discussion of responses within international 
institutions. 

VISIONS, GOALS AND TARGETS ON THE ROAD TO 2050
This section introduces a sustainable world vision for 2050 
with specific goals and targets derived mainly from existing 
international agreements. Visioning activates awareness, 
emotion and imagination with the intention of bringing new 
systems into being, while the 40-year perspective allows enough 
space for societies to identify policy options and initiate the 
structural transformations required.

The challenge of meeting both human needs and human 
aspirations within the planet’s carrying capacity makes the overall

ambition complex (UNEP 2011c, 2007; WBCSD 2010; 
MA 2005b; WCED 1987). A number of countries have attained 
high levels of human development, but this has often been 
at the expense of the global natural resource base and 
environmental quality, and has resulted in high levels of 
greenhouse gas emissions (Figure 16.3). Given the analysis in 
Part 1, it is clear that this development path is not sustainable 
in the long run. Many other countries, meanwhile, are faced with 
prioritizing the basic human needs of their citizens – such as 
energy, food and water – over protecting the global commons. 
In general, these countries currently exert a lower per-person 
pressure on the global environment, but the overall pressure can 
still be significant where the population is large, or where there are 
local environmental problems. Furthermore, when future dynamics 
are taken into account, the situation may get even worse.

A vision of a sustainable world could be based on the simultaneous 
achievement of broad overarching goals that take into account 
the fulfilment of basic human needs, mainly related to reliable 
and affordable energy, food, drinking water and sanitation, and 
the achievement of environmental sustainability at the global, 
national, regional and local levels. Such a vision was the basis of 
the 1992 Rio Declaration (UNCED 1992) and was advanced further 
in the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) (UN 2000).

A sustainable world cannot be realized until it is widely and actively 
envisioned. Of the available tools to address the challenges ahead,

visioning is critical to crafting profound and enduring change. 
Vision statements have a specific form: they describe the future, 
yet they are phrased in the present tense as if the desired change 
had already occurred. Box 16.1 presents a possible vision for

Part 3: Global Responses

Box 16.1 A possible vision of the world on a path towards sustainability in 2050

The year is 2050. What appeared to be so improbable at the 
start of the second decade of the century is turning out to be 
possible, after all. Changes have been great, and there have 
been deep losses. Although people expect and are prepared 
for far greater changes than any yet experienced, a sense of 
possibility abounds as there have been so many successes.

Climate change is still a problem, but emissions have nearly 
halved compared to four decades ago. Basic drinking water 
and sanitation needs of even the poorest have been met. 
Learning and mimicking nature’s resilience has helped restore 
ecological function in areas once considered irretrievably 
lost. The most devastating projections for ocean acidification, 
groundwater salinity, desertification and land degradation have 
not materialized – with real implications for the food system 
worldwide. An eco-efficient, highly diversified agricultural 
system ensures that food shortages are infrequent, local, 
and mostly due to extreme weather events. Civil instability 
and conflict over resources, food and water is now rare. More 
humans enjoy a higher quality of life for longer than ever before, 
without denying future generations the same possibility. 

Most of the world’s citizens are actively and personally 
engaged with humanity’s goal of living within planetary 
limits. Peak oil and peaks in the supply of some other natural 
resources have come and gone, but thanks to radical changes 
in lifestyle and resource productivity, have not led to the 
disruption of absolute scarcity. Leadership is everywhere; as a 
result, diverse, innovative, bottom-up initiatives abound and 
are spread through social networks, faster than ever before. 

Governance systems, more than ever, are creating synergistic 
impacts. There has been a tangible shift in the willingness 
to look for truly sustainable alternatives, a consensus to 
aim for prosperity rather than continued economic growth 
at all costs, a commitment to redirect investments to green 
entrepreneurship and innovation. Knowledge of nature, 
species and ecosystems is used as a measure and model for 
humanity’s greatest challenges. Indigenous and traditional 
knowledge, women’s access to education, governance and 
decision making, and a successful balance in North-South 
and developed-developing perspectives are the forums for 
pursuing these goals: each shows clearly that human systems 
esteem diversity as a form of wisdom. 

How did this happen? Perhaps things had to get worse before 
they got better. Perhaps each problem that the financial, social, 
and ecological debt crises presented had a positive outcome. 
Ironically, the lynchpin in this transition was an element 
that had previously been all but overlooked in international 
governance. A generation of young people emerged, by nature 
more comfortable with visioning, social networking and truth-
telling than its elders. The resulting intergenerational contract, 
building on momentum already present in society supported 
a generation of problem-solvers who had never learned 
values and behaviours that undermined planetary life-support 
systems, and who could envision solutions and success 
previously unforeseen. 

Achieving these outcomes was the result of a major global 
effort that began at the 2012 World Summit in Rio. 

2050, in line with the internationally agreed goals summarized in 
Table 16.1. Its transition pathways and key strategic elements are 
described in the subsequent sections of this chapter. 

Obviously, other important global sustainable development 
targets exist, and the vision and goals outlined here (Box 16.1; 
Table 16.1) cannot provide a complete picture of a sustainable 
world. A vision develops through evolution and must have 
contributions from many people before it is mature and 
compelling. Thus, the vision captured here is only a start: it 
represents an invitation to individuals to envision the world they 
really want in 2050. Catalysing human imagination is integral to 
realizing a sustainable, desirable future. 

The analysis that follows reflects the thematic structure of Part 
1: first the global drivers of environmental change, followed 
by the environmental themes of atmosphere, land, water and 
biodiversity. As there has been little scenario building on the 
theme of Chapter 6 – chemicals and waste – it is not included in 
this analysis, although for the sake of completeness it appears 
in Table 16.1. Since meeting basic human needs is crucial to a 

sustainable development strategy, related human well-being 
objectives are addressed, where appropriate, under each theme. 
In the selection process, care was taken to ensure that targets 
properly address the desired state of the global environment and  
basic human needs.

At this point, it is also important to note that internationally 
agreed goals and targets are, by definition, a result of political 
compromise. They take into account scientifically established 
thresholds to a varying degree, but they may not be fully in 
agreement with them, particularly as scientific understanding 
of where such thresholds may lie is also evolving. Therefore, 
in some cases, selected targets only include a qualitative 
description of the objective, without further specification, either 
because of lack of data or because there is still divergence 
over quantifiable targets. For the climate change problem, for 
instance, what level of global mean temperature increase is seen 
as dangerous – and therefore must be avoided according to the 
qualitative objective agreed in the United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) – is highly debated. Yet, 
the risks associated with temperature rise are clear, and some

Part 3: Global Responses

are becoming more acute, so preventative and precautionary 
action is necessary as a form of sustainability insurance (UNFCCC 
2010). Strengthening the long-term globally agreed target on 
the basis of the best available scientific knowledge, rather than 
of political consensus, is still an issue under consideration at 
UNFCCC meetings. Overall, the targets are based on the latest 
multilateral agreements associated with the goals that inspire 
and guide humanity towards a specific destination.

PATHWAYS TO ACHIEVE LONG-TERM SUSTAINABILITY 
GOALS 
This section examines the existing literature on quantitative 
scenarios to outline how sustainability targets might be met. 
The chapter looks at the scenarios used in earlier assessments 
and published in the scientific literature and summarizes the 
findings for the conventional world projections, scenarios that 
describe the consequences of continuing current policies, 
and compares them to sustainable world projections, those 
that aim to reach the long-term targets envisioned above. The 
purpose of this comparison is to assess the gap between these 
different pathways and to discuss how it might be closed. The 
two scenario categories have some general characteristics. 
Conventional world scenarios typically extrapolate historical 
trends, assuming no new policy direction, also described in 
the literature as business-as-usual. They also usually assume a 
continuing increase in the use of material goods and services, 
driven by the same market dynamics dominant in the world 
today. These scenarios thus tend to ignore the risks associated 
with environmental degradation and resource scarcity. 
Sustainable world scenarios, in contrast, explore the changes 
required if sustainable development goals are to be met. Clearly, 
this category includes a wide range of scenarios based on the use 
of advanced technologies, increased efficiency and/or lifestyle 

changes. In some cases new calculations have been performed to 
respond to gaps in the literature. 

Drivers
Population and income
The global population is projected to grow to 8–10.5 billion 
people by 2050 (Figure 16.4) (UNDESA 2011; Lutz et al. 2008). 
By far the largest share of population growth is expected 
in countries that are currently low-income, mainly in sub-
Saharan Africa, Northern Africa and West Asia, and South Asia. 
Generally, low population scenarios are more likely to lead to 
lower environmental pressure than high ones, although high 
population scenarios that result in low emissions can also 
be found in the literature (van Vuuren et al. 2012). Still, the 
importance of population growth in the context of sustainability 
targets has been recognized at the highest UN level (ICPD 1994). 
Investing in women’s education is one of the most effective 
methods of reducing population growth, as women with higher 
levels of education have fewer children. Scenario analysis by Lutz 
and Samir (2011) shows a global population ranging from 8.9 to 
10.0 billion people in 2050 as a result of a high or low education 
scenario alone.

Nearly all scenarios project a further increase in GDP as an 
indicator of economic development, although there is variation 
between scenarios, with global average per-person growth rates 
ranging between 1.2 and 2.2 per cent annually (Figure 16.4). 
The relationship between income and environmental change 
is ambiguous. On the one hand, high income tends to coincide 
with high consumption levels, leading to further environmental 
degradation. On the other, an increase in income can also 
coincide with lower population levels, an increasing appreciation 
of a clean environment and rapid technological change. These

Scenarios and Sustainability Transformation   427

growth paradigm for example (WCED 1987), while others 
highlight trade-offs and the correlation between consumption 
rates and the flow of material goods, as in the steady-state 
economy paradigm (Czech and Daly 2004; Daly 1974, 1971). 
The difference depends on factors such as technological 
development, macro-economic feedbacks and avoided 
environmental damage (UNEP 2011b).

Consumption
Global average consumption levels have risen significantly 
during recent decades, outpacing simultaneous improvements in 
efficiency. Increases in both the number and size of cars have been 
much greater than improvements in fuel efficiency, leading to a rapid 
increase in overall transport fuel consumption (Girod et al. 2012). In 
fact, efficiency improvement itself may induce higher consumption 
levels by decreasing the cost of consumption – the rebound effect. 
Changing consumption patterns could form an important part of 
a sustainable development strategy as it often leads to multiple 
benefits and brings environmental concerns closer to consumers. 
Historically, however, campaigns aimed at changing consumption 
patterns have not always been successful. The effectiveness of 
changes in consumption can be illustrated by scenario studies on 
dietary change, discussed below in the section on land.

There is increasing recognition of the importance of the 
environment for human development and quality of life (World 
Bank 2008; UNEP 2007; MA 2005b). Currently, an estimated 
24 per cent of the global disease burden and 23 per cent of all 
deaths can be attributed to environmental factors (Prüss-Üstün 
and Corvalán 2006). For child mortality, in particular, low levels 
of food intake, unsafe drinking water, a lack of basic sanitation 
and the use of solid fuels for cooking and heating are important 
drivers (Black et al. 2010). Analysis shows that, despite some 
progress, in conventional world scenarios, full access to sufficient 
food, water, and energy will not be reached for many countries in 
South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa by 2030, or even 2050 (World 
Bank/IMF 2011; Hilderink et al. 2009). 

Atmosphere
Conventional world scenarios
Almost all scenarios that assume no major policy changes expect 
energy consumption to continue to grow worldwide. On average, 
they project energy consumption to increase by a factor of three 
over the 21st century, with a range of 2.5–5.5 (van Vuuren et al. 
2012; Clarke et al. 2010; Fisher et al. 2007). Moreover, such 
conventional world scenarios project fossil fuels to retain a large 
market share as their price, especially for coal, is expected to 
be lower than that of alternative fuels. Despite the domination 
of fossil fuels, however, most scenarios project a significant 
increase in non-fossil energy production, including biomass, 
solar, wind and other renewables, as well as nuclear. 

The projections also indicate that by 2030 nearly 3 billion 
people, mostly in rural areas in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia,  
will still rely on traditional biomass for cooking and heating, 
while about 1 billion people will have no access to electricity 
(GEA 2011; IEA et al. 2010). Conventional world scenarios also

trends may lead to a decrease in environmental pressure as 
incomes rise, as observed, for instance, for local air pollution, 
the so-called environmental Kuznets curve (Chapter 1) (van 
Ruijven et al. 2008; Riahi et al. 2007; Smith 2005; Stern 2003). 
This effect has, however, not been observed for many global 
environmental problems, including carbon dioxide (CO2) 
emissions, and there have been reports of displacement effects 
– with production shifting to low-income countries – underlying 
some Kuznets observations (Luzzati and Orsini 2009). It is 
important to note that it is not the level or rate of economic 
growth that determines environmental impacts, but its structure. 
For example, a focus on services rather than material goods 
could reduce the pressure on natural resources. Consistent with 
this scientific debate, no straightforward relationship between 
income projections and achievement of sustainability targets 
can be found in global scenarios (van Vuuren et al. 2012). 
Some scholars emphasize the positive feedbacks between 
economic growth and achieving sustainability goals, the green

consistently project high numbers of people suffering from 
the health consequences of traditional fuel use, with around 
1.5 million annual premature deaths resulting from indoor air 
pollution in 2030 (IEA et al. 2010). The use of traditional fuels 
in inefficient stoves can also have serious implications for 
deforestation and local and regional air pollution (FAO 2006a; 
IEA 2006; Arnold et al. 2003). It should be noted that fuelwood 
use could actually increase in response to rising prices for 
modern fuels (Easterling et al. 2007). 

Increasing fossil fuel use implies increasing emissions of 
greenhouse gases. On average, conventional world scenarios 
project greenhouse gas emissions to more or less double in 
the next 50 years (van Vuuren et al. 2012; PBL 2009; Fisher 
et al. 2007). Scientific knowledge leaves little doubt that a 
consequence of the increase will be a steady rise in global mean 
temperature (Figure 16.5) (van Vuuren et al. 2008a, 2008b; IPCC 
2007), of 3–5oC relative to pre-industrial levels by the end of the 
century. There is considerable uncertainty regarding both climate 
change and its impacts. The IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report 
indicates that a warming of 4oC is likely to have negative effects 
on agricultural yields in most parts of the world (Easterling et 
al. 2007), with sensitive systems – coral reefs, some mountain 
ecosystems, polar sea ice and many of the world’s glaciers – 
likely to be lost and sea levels possibly rising by more than 1 
metre by the end of the century. Moreover, there is a risk of 
passing critical thresholds for the functioning of the Amazon 
rainforest (IPCC 2007), as well as an increase in the frequency of 
storms, droughts and other extreme weather events.

Historically, people have tended to invest more in the control of 
air pollution as they become more affluent. Typically, emissions 

increase in the early stages of development, but may diminish 
as incomes rise. In conventional world scenarios, emissions are 
usually shown to decrease slowly in the first decades of the 21st 
century in high-income countries, but to increase in low-income 
ones (van Ruijven et al. 2008). Globally, for many air pollutants

this results in a pattern of stable or slightly decreasing emissions 
(Figure 16.6); although with considerable uncertainty. During 
most of the century, therefore, these scenarios suggest that 
targets for health standards are unlikely to be met in many parts 
of the world.

modern energy to all is small: the increase in CO2 emissions from 
fossil fuels could be around 1 per cent of global emissions in 
2030 compared to a conventional world scenario, but this would 
be compensated for by reduced fuelwood demand and thereby 
reduced deforestation (GEA 2011; IEA et al. 2010).

Sustainable world scenarios
Several scenario studies assess the sustainability target 
of providing universal access to modern energy (Table 16.1) 
(GEA 2011; Pachuari et al. 2011; van Ruijven et al. 2012; 
IEA 2010). Improving access to electricity requires accelerating 
the pace of electrification in the least developed countries either 
by grid expansion or by the development of decentralized mini-
grids or off-grid systems (AGECC 2010). For cooking, to increase 
energy efficiency and decrease health impacts, the main strategy 
is to promote the use of advanced-combustion biomass stoves 
or to make a full transition to cleaner fuels (Venkataraman et al. 
2010). Scenario analysis shows that such strategies could avoid 
more than 1 million premature deaths per year up to 2030 (GEA 
2011). Estimates of the annual investments to implement such 
strategies range from US$10 billion to 140 billion per year (GEA 
2011; Bazilian et al. 2010; IEA et al. 2010). Scenario analysis 
also suggests that the climate impact of ensuring access to 

Based on current estimates of the uncertainty in climate 
sensitivity (IPCC 2007), targets for greenhouse gas concentrations 
of 450 parts per million (ppm) and 400 ppm CO2-equivalent 
would ensure a median chance of 50 per cent and 70 per cent, 
respectively, of staying below the UNFCCC’s agreed limit of a  
2oC temperature increase (Table 16.1) (Meinshausen et al. 2006). 
Sustainable world scenarios show that to reach such targets, 
global greenhouse gas emissions would need to peak in just one 
to two decades, then fall to around half the current levels, or even 
less, by 2050, and by the end of century would need to reach zero 
or even result in a net absorption – which could, for instance, be 
done by afforestation or by the combination of bio-energy and 
carbon capture and storage (van Vuuren and Riahi 2011; UNEP 
2010a). There are four basic ways to reduce emissions: 
•	 changing	the	structure	of	economic	growth;
•	 increasing	energy	efficiency	through	technology	or	lifestyle	

changes;

•	 changing	energy	supply	including	using	zero-carbon	energy	

options; and 

•	 implementing	end-of-pipe	measures	such	as	carbon	capture	

and storage. 

Reaching the sustainable world emission reduction targets 
(Table 16.1) requires a broad portfolio of measures. Figure 16.7 
provides an indication of the size of the transition involved. 
Very many scenarios show that a low-carbon economy can be 
achieved with currently identifiable technologies, and they share 
a number of common features (Clarke et al. 2010; ECF 2010; 
Fisher et al. 2007; van Vuuren et al. 2007):
•	 Energy	efficiency	improvement	is	a	robust	option	under	all	

scenarios.

•	 Energy	generation	provides	very	significant	emission	

reduction potential by introducing combinations of renewable 
energy, nuclear power and/or carbon capture and storage, 
although each of these has limitations and drawbacks. 
Indeed, the centralized energy sector could even achieve net 
negative emissions if it were based on bio-energy use with 
carbon capture and storage.

•	 Reducing	non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions such as 
methane, nitrous oxide, and black carbon and ozone 
precursors could contribute significantly to mitigating 
climate change at relatively low cost, for example by reducing 
methane emissions from energy production and some of the 
methane emissions from livestock and rice cultivation.

•	 Lifestyle	changes	are	not	often	explicitly	accounted	for	in	

scenarios, but may achieve considerable reductions such as 
in transport or food consumption.

•	 The	use	of	bio-energy	is	very	common	in	low-emission	

scenarios (van Vuuren et al. 2010). Bio-energy production 

may, however, have serious consequences for biodiversity, 
food production and greenhouse gas emissions (Dornburg 
et al. 2010; Searchinger et al. 2008; Bringezu et al. 2009; 
Fargione et al. 2008), so needs to be carefully monitored 
and the available potential used as efficiently as possible. 
Moreover, it would be important to focus the use of bio-

Although air quality could be significantly improved in low-
income countries through the rapid introduction of state-of-the-
art technologies, it should be noted that air pollutant emissions 
are also strongly influenced by structural changes in the energy 
sector. In addition to the importance of pollutants such as 
methane and black carbon for climate change, the fact that 
they also negatively affect health and crop growth (via ground-
level ozone) might be a much more important trigger for their 
reduction than climate change alone. The sustainable world 
scenarios show that stringent climate policies and existing air 
pollution control measures could significantly reduce emissions. 
The adoption of such strategies could be successful in achieving 
World Health Organization air quality targets, and their combined 
benefit would be delivered at much lower costs than the sum of 
separate strategies to meet climate and air pollution goals (UNEP 
2011a; GEA 2011; Bollen 2008).

There are several possible consequences to the movement 
towards a low-carbon society. Some of these are co-benefits, 
for instance for greenhouse gases and air pollution, or emission 
reductions and improved energy security. There are some trade-

offs as well. For instance, the reduction in aerosol emissions that 
results from measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will 
initially partly offset the climate benefits from current aerosol 
cooling effects. An important trade-off concerns bio-energy, 
but other technologies also have side effects. Hydropower 
infrastructure can have several impacts, such as loss of 
agricultural land, replacement of settlements, biodiversity loss 
and ongoing greenhouse gas emission episodes from water 
bodies (Fearnside 2011; St. Louis et al. 2000). Wind turbines 
regularly face opposition from local communities and carbon 
capture and storage (once it can be applied on a large scale) 
may entail risks of CO2 release. Climate policy will also interact 
with forestry management, which could lead to both positive and 
negative impacts on biodiversity. 

Land 
Conventional world scenarios
A wide range of models, from economic to biophysical, has been 
used to explore future trends in land use (Smith et al. 2010). 
All the studies project a strong increase in the demand for food 
up to 2050, driven by a rising population and dietary change 
spurred by economic growth. Between 2000 and 2050, global 
cereal demand is projected to increase by 70–75 per cent while 
meat consumption is expected to double (Thornton 2010; IAASTD 
2009a; FAO 2006b). Meeting these needs, while avoiding a large 
expansion of agricultural land and protecting biodiversity, will be 
a major challenge. Ensuring food security will also be an issue 
as world food markets are likely to be influenced by increasing 

resource scarcity. A key mitigating factor will be continued 
investments in yield growth and intensification on existing 
cultivated land (FAO 2011; UNEP 2011b; Rosegrant et al. 2009).

Food security exists when all people, at all times, have physical, 
social and economic access to enough safe and nutritious food to 
meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and 
healthy life (FAO 1996). Looking at per-person food availability 
in the conventional world scenarios, by 2050 average calorie 
availability per person per day will be around 3 000–3 500 
calories, but projected food availability in sub-Saharan Africa is 
much lower, in the range of 2 100–3 350 calories. Environmental 
degradation, lack of investment and competition for land are 
expected to push world food prices upwards, causing additional 
stress to the poor, especially in urban areas (OECD/FAO 2011; 
IAASTD 2009a). In other words, the conventional world scenarios 
suggest that it is very unlikely that malnutrition will be fully 
eradicated by 2050 without major policy shifts (IAASTD 2009a; 
UNEP 2007; FAO 2006b; MA 2005a). The prevalence of child 
malnutrition for 2050 in developing countries is projected to 
range between 13 per cent and 25 per cent (Figure 16.8; Box 
16.2). The highest levels of undernourishment are projected in 
countries that currently suffer from hunger, have high population 
growth rates and poor prospects for rapid economic growth, and 
possess limited agricultural resources (FAO 2006b).

Population growth and dietary change have contributed to a 
rising demand for agricultural products. In the past four decades,

around 78 per cent of the global increase in agricultural supply 
has been achieved through increases in yield and greater 
efficiency in the supply chain; a further 7 per cent has come from 
increased cropping intensity; while a mere 15 per cent has come 
from expansion of the arable area (Smith et al. 2010; Bruinsma 
2003). At the regional level, however, large differences can be 
seen. In sub-Saharan Africa, for instance, only 34 per cent of 
the rise in output was derived from yield increases, and the 
remaining 66 per cent came from area expansion (Mery et al. 
2010; Smith et al. 2010). These factors are expected to continue 
to be important in the future, although trends will differ over time 
and across regions. 

Yield growth has slowed over the last several decades 
(FAOSTAT 2012). Moreover, environmental pressures, including 
the effects of climate change and ground-level ozone, could 
also have a negative impact on yields in the future. IPCC 
estimates of the potential global impact of climate change on 
crops under high temperature increase scenarios  
(4°C compared to pre-industrial), although uncertain, suggest 
that if no adaptation occurs climate change could have a 
substantial negative impact on yields, of 10–35 per cent at all 
latitudes for crops like maize and wheat. Adaptation measures 
could, in aggregate, ward off negative impacts in temperate 
regions, but could not avoid an average yield reduction of 
around 10 per cent in tropical zones (Easterling et al. 2007).

When focusing on crop production, scenarios show some 
variation in terms of expected land use (Figure 16.9) (Smith  
et al. 2010). The 2050 projections for cropland increase range 
from as low as 6 per cent, through an average increase of  
around 10–20 per cent (van Vuuren et al. 2008b) to more than  
30 per cent as suggested by the IPCC’s A2 scenario, which is 

based on high population growth. Regional results can be very 
different: while a considerable expansion of arable land 
is expected in Africa, Asia and Latin America, this is  
compensated for by a decrease in harvested area in the 
temperate zone (van Vuuren et al. 2008b; UNEP 2007).  
As land degradation (CBD 2010b) is typically not accounted for 
in scenario analysis, the real impacts could be worse.

Scenarios and Sustainability Transformation   433

For animal products, existing scenarios indicate that most of the 
increases in global livestock production will occur in developing 
countries (Bouwman et al. 2005). In grazing systems, strong 
growth is expected for confined livestock production systems, 
while most studies show an increase of 10 per cent or less in 
pasture areas. 

Sustainable world scenarios
Given the strong connection between agricultural production and 
the ecosystem services that provide food, forage, fibre, energy 
and biodiversity, achieving sustainable development as it affects 
agriculture and land resources requires an integrated approach 
(Smith et al. 2010). Such an integrated approach would take into 

Box 16.2 Integrated simulation of the 2050 targets for climate, food and land

Can very high investments in agriculture and water productivity 
help to achieve the sustainability objectives discussed earlier 
in this chapter? Here, this question is explored using the 
International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) IMPACT 
model (International Model for Policy Analysis of Agricultural 
Commodities and Trade) (Nelson et al. 2010; Rosegrant et 
al. 2008). Previous analyses have shown the importance of 
economic development in reducing hunger and malnutrition 
(Nelson et al. 2010). 

Compared to a conventional world scenario, economic growth 
in developing countries is assumed to be higher and population 
growth to be lower overall (Nelson et al. 2010). Additional 
investments in agricultural research and development will 
lead to rapid increases in agricultural production: as a result, 
by 2030, grain yields are 15 per cent greater than in the 
corresponding conventional world scenario and by 2050, they 
are 35 per cent greater. Furthermore, livestock numbers are up by 
30 per cent. It is also assumed that the UNFCCC’s agreed limit of a 
2oC temperature rise relative to pre-industrial levels has been 
achieved, and that there is full access to safe drinking water by 
2050, and that all girls have access to secondary schooling by 
2030. Finally, the water efficiency improvements suggested by 
the sustainable water withdrawal scenarios are also included 
(with the exception of a constant irrigated area) (Box 16.3). 

The changes outlined above result in average cereal prices 
being respectively 21 per cent and 39 per cent lower by 2030 
and 2050 compared to the conventional world scenario. 
Under the conventional world scenario, the global harvested 
crop area is expected to grow at 0.23 per cent per year or 
169 million hectares for 2005–2050, with contractions in 
some OECD countries and Asia more than offset by increases 
in sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America. In the sustainable 
world scenario, on the other hand, crop area contracts by 116 
million hectares by 2030 and by 201 million hectares by 2050. 
The lower food prices suggested by the sustainable world 
scenario are expected to boost affordability and thus access 
to food, increasing daily calorie availability in the developing 
world by 496 kilocalories by 2030 and 1 336 kilocalories 
by 2050. As a result, about 50 million children would be 
malnourished, a fall of 66 million or 57 per cent. The model 
calculations, however, also show that eradicating hunger 
in 2050 is a complex, multifaceted challenge: importantly, 
significant steps can be made through changes in investment 
and policies. Key factors that can make a difference for 
childhood malnutrition include increasing the availability 
of food, access to safe drinking water and increased female 
secondary school enrolment. Moreover, mitigation of and 
adaptation to climate change will make a positive difference 
for agricultural production.

Part 3: Global Responses

account the relationship between competing demands for limited 
land resources and the environmental impact on agricultural 
production (UNEP 2010b). 

One key to ensuring future access to food is investment in 
agricultural research to improve productivity (Rosegrant et al. 
2009). Another is to reduce food wastage and loss – currently 
around 10–40 per cent of agricultural production is wasted 
(Parfitt et al. 2010). Through lifestyle changes, technological 
development and investment in infrastructure, it is possible to 
significantly remedy this wastage (Jäger and Cornell 2011; Parfitt 
et al. 2010). Alterations in people’s diets could also help reduce 
the need for additional production. Scenario studies have looked 
into the consequences of reducing consumption of livestock 
products through substitution of vegetable alternatives. Different 
results have been published on the land consequences of such 
dietary changes. Some studies suggest considerable reductions 
in land-use (Ten Brink et al. 2010; Stehfest et al. 2009), while 
others highlight the risk of a rebound effect, with reduced meat 
consumption in developed countries leading to increased meat 
and cereal consumption in the rest of the world (Rosegrant et al. 
1999). There is also some discussion of the health implication of 
low-meat diets: although studies claim benefits in high-income 
countries from reducing overconsumption of meat, low-meat 
diets need to be well designed. 

Very few projections can be found that actually result in food 
security for all by 2050. According to the Food and Agriculture 
Organization of the United Nations (FAO 2009), however, 
it could be accomplished if global food supplies expand 
by about 70 per cent above current levels. The conditions 
under which this could be achieved include political stability, 
good governance, food security strategies, integration of 
world markets and strong economic growth, all on the basis 
of an increase in agricultural production in Africa, Asia and 
Latin America. This implies ensuring that agricultural trade 
liberalization – integration of world markets – does not lead to 
negative impacts on vulnerable communities (Jäger and Cornell 
2011). The International Assessment of Agricultural Knowledge, 
Science and Technology for Development (IAASTD 2009a) 
includes a scenario with increased investments in agricultural 
technology combined with increased investment in water 
infrastructure and female secondary education. This scenario 
shows a significant increase in food availability but still leaves 
8 per cent of children malnourished, mostly in sub-Saharan 
Africa. Clearly, access to food needs to be viewed in the context 
of poverty reduction both to promote rural development and to 
provide direct and immediate access to food for the most needy 
(Broca 2002).

Figure 16.9 shows that some scenarios lead to little expansion 
and even contraction of the agricultural area. One contributing 
factor is reduced rates of population growth leading to 
smaller increases in the demand for food. If historical yield 
growth rates can be maintained, the global agricultural area 
could be stabilized or even reduced. Indeed, the analyses by 
IAASTD (2009a) and Thornton (2010) show that it is possible 

to increase yields significantly on the basis of better use of 
agricultural knowledge, science and technology – although this 
will be far from easy. Policies that lead to higher agricultural 
yields need to be combined with policies that reduce or avoid 
soil degradation and other negative environmental trends 
such as the loss of crop resilience to pests (Killham 2010; 
Petermann et al. 2008; Kaiser et al. 2007; Paulitz et al. 2002). 
Finally, it is also necessary to effectively and fairly define 
property rights and develop local institutions that foster 
longer-term investment in the use of water, soil and biological 
resources in agriculture and forestry (FAO 2011; Von Braun and 
Meinzen-Dick 2009; Hazell and Wood 2008). The crop yields 
in the sustainable world scenarios also benefit from reduced 
climate change impacts. The IPCC assessment indicates that 
the combination of agricultural adaptation and an increase 
in temperature of less than 2oC above pre-industrial levels 
may even result, in aggregate, in positive impacts on globally 
averaged yields (Easterling et al. 2007).

Policy options that could improve sustainable agricultural 
production include:
•	 supporting	investments	in	increasing	crop	yields	in	

developing countries to limit the expansion of agricultural 
land and to close the yield gap between developed and 
developing countries;

•	 promoting	adaptation	to	climate	change	by	encouraging	

crops and crop varieties that are more resilient under 
changing climatic conditions;

•	 investing	in	infrastructure,	food	processing	and	storage	

techniques to reduce food waste;

•	 better	utilizing	urban-rural	landscapes	for	food	systems	and	

natural resource use;

•	 reducing	consumption	of	livestock	products;	and
•	 strengthening	land-use	policies	and	planning	by	promoting	

integrated land and resource management.

While it is technically possible to achieve zero expansion of 
agricultural area and still produce sufficient or more food, 
implementing this presents a large number of challenges. Key 
among these are the continuing degradation of land and water, 
climate change and the rising demand for biofuels 
(FAO 2009). For example, the current trend of increasing 
emissions and water pollution from nitrogen fertilizers is 
expected to increase by 2050, despite potential for greater 
efficiency in fertilizer use (Power 2010; Bruinsma 2003). 
Furthermore, the predicted growth in animal production in 
developing countries will lead to more methane and nitrous 
oxide emissions from manure, although the projected 
improvement in husbandry will somewhat reduce emissions 
per animal (Smeets et al. 2009; Bouwman et al. 2006). While 
climate change mitigation is designed to reduce negative 
climate impacts, in specific regions such as the Russian 
Federation, such policy will result in forestalling potentially 
positive yield changes. Furthermore, improvements will 
also depend on potential trade-offs between allocations of 
agricultural land for crops or for biofuels, which could further 
threaten food production and security. 

Scenarios and Sustainability Transformation   435

Water
Conventional world scenarios
Chapter 4 shows that many regions are seriously affected by 
an imbalance between the availability and withdrawal of water, 
water stress and water pollution from different sources. River 
systems are considered the most endangered ecosystems 
on the planet and their loss of biodiversity has been faster 
over the past 30 years than in any other terrestrial or marine 
ecosystem (Jenkins and Lowe 2003). The Johannesburg Plan 
of Implementation (WSSD 2002) Paragraph 26c calls not 
only for an efficient and well-balanced use of freshwater 
resources but also for the safeguarding of drinking water 
quality. Important drivers of water scarcity include population 
growth, increasing water consumption, pollution and climate 
change. Increasing water use, river and reservoir regulation, 
or non-treated return flows lead to alterations in flow regimes 
that contribute to intensified and complex conflicts between 
ecosystem requirements and the management of rivers for 
human water supply and energy generation. Climate change 
can affect freshwater problems in many ways through changes 
in precipitation, discharge rates, extreme events, reduced 
dilution capacity of rivers and salinization due to sea level rise 
(Schneider et al. 2011; Bates et al. 2008).

Several scenario assessments exist, showing large variations 
in projected water withdrawals – the total volume of water 
extracted from surface or groundwater sources for various 
uses – based on different assumptions on such factors as 
population, consumption patterns and technology availability 
(Figure 16.10). Most of the estimates of water withdrawals 
indicate a large global net increase, but with significant regional 
differences. The most important factor for this increase is the 

growth of household water use, followed by industrial and 
agricultural use (Alcamo et al. 2007). As a result of increasing 
withdrawals, effluent returns are also likely to increase, many 
of which remain untreated in low-income regions. For the 
GEO-4 “markets first” scenario, for instance, the volume of 
untreated wastewater was reported to steadily increase despite 
improvement in treatment. In the GEO-4 “sustainability first” 
scenario, in contrast, the volume of untreated wastewater fell 
as a result of an overall decrease in wastewater due to greater 
efficiency (UNEP 2007). The GEO-5 calculations are discussed in 
more detail in Box 16.3.

Increases in water withdrawals are projected to lead to an 
increase in water stress (Arnell et al. 2011; Alcamo et al. 
2007, 2003; Cosgrove and Rijsberman 2000; Vörösmarty et 
al. 2000). More than 2 billion people currently live in severely 
water-stressed areas, primarily in Asia (Figure 16.12). Model 
simulations show that under the conventional world scenarios, 
the number of people living in water-stressed areas, as well as 
the extent of these areas, is expected to rise substantially due to 
population growth, increased use of water and climate change. 
The ratio of future to current numbers is given in Figure 16.12, 
which also demonstrates the uncertainty in the scenarios as a 
result of different assumptions about climate and other global 
change. Increases are highest in Africa, where the number of 
people living in severe water-stressed areas is expected to grow 
fourfold (median). In South America and Asia significant changes 
may also occur. In many river basins under severe water stress, 
there will be competition between domestic, industrial and 
agricultural users. It should be noted that changes in the use and 
natural condition of water somewhere in a river catchment area 
will affect the availability and quality of water downstream.

Currently nearly 1 billion people lack access to clean drinking 
water and 2.6 billion lack access to improved sanitation services 
(WHO/UNICEF 2010). In 2004, unsafe water and inadequate 
sanitation were responsible for around 1.6 million deaths and 
6.3 per cent of worldwide disability adjusted life-years (DALYs), 
mainly due to diarrhoea (WHO/UNICEF 2010). Scenario analysis 
suggests that by 2015, 627 million people will still live without 
access to clean drinking water and 2.7 billion people will live 
without access to improved sanitation. Different studies project 
long-term developments in drinking water and sanitation, either 
by assuming a continuation of the 1990–2000 improvement 
rates (Prüss-Üstün et al. 2004) or by using cross-sectional 
relationships with socio-economic indicators (OECD 2012; 

Hughes et al. 2011). These studies project that the proportion 
of the world’s population without access to safe drinking water 
will diminish from 23 per cent in 2000 to 3–5 per cent in 2050. 
For sanitation, the proportion will diminish from 51 per cent in 
2000 to 15–18 per cent in 2050. This would lead to a significant 
reduction in the numbers of children suffering from related ill 
health (OECD 2012; Hughes et al. 2011). 

Sustainable world scenarios
The goal for water is to reduce global water stress. Several 
scenarios have explored the scope for achieving this, such as 
the “technogarden” scenario from the Millennium Ecosystem 
Assessment (Alcamo et al. 2005b), and three alternative 

Box 16.3 The sustainable world scenario for water withdrawals

Simulations were carried out to calculate future water 
availability, water withdrawals (Figures 16.10 and 16.11) and 
water stress (Figure 16.12) under conventional and sustainable 
world scenario conditions, assuming the same socio-economic 
development. In these calculations, for the sustainable world 
scenario the following assumptions were made: 
•	 stringent	efficiency	measures	are	taken	in	industry	and	

residential water use;

•	 the	irrigation	area	remains	constant;
•	 climate	policies	lead	to	a	reduced	demand	for	thermal	

cooling in power generation as fossil-fuel-powered plants 
are partly replaced by renewable energy sources; and 
•	 the	climate	patterns	were	assumed	to	be	consistent	

with limiting global temperature rise to 2oC above pre-
industrial levels. 

As a result, global water withdrawals after 2015 are projected 
to decrease substantially compared to the conventional 
world scenario (Figure 16.11). Nevertheless, regions affected 
by severe water stress still exist and the number of people 
living in river basins suffering from water stress could reach 
3.9 billion in 2050 (Figure 16.12). An important lesson is 
that improvements in efficiency of water use are necessary 
to reduce water withdrawals, but are insufficient to avoid 
water scarcity. The core issue is the amount of water used for 
irrigation and the high concentration of water demand in urban 
areas. In other words, if water scarcity is to be reduced further, 
fundamental changes in agricultural practices are needed – 
improving irrigation efficiency, shifting irrigated areas from 
water-scarce to water-rich basins, moving from irrigated crops 
to rain-fed crops, or relying on imports from other regions.

transition scenarios developed by the WBCSD (WBCSD 2006). 
The main measure, increased efficiency, is discussed in  
Box 16.3. In general, the sustainable world scenarios lead to 
lower numbers of people living with severe water stress, mostly 
as a result of a reduction in water withdrawals due to behavioural 
and technological change. However, even under sustainable 
world scenario assumptions, some regions experience a doubling 
(median) in the number of people living with water stress 
compared with current conditions (Figure 16.12). Nevertheless, 
due to regional population growth and spatial variation of 
climate change impacts, an increase in water stress is apparent 
compared to current conditions. This implies that competition 
between water-related sectors would still be important.

The OECD’s Environmental Outlook to 2050 (OECD 2012) assesses 
the costs and benefits of halving the number of people without 
access to safe drinking water by 2030 compared to 2005 levels, 
and of full access by 2050. The study indicates that, to reach 
such goals, significant additional infrastructure investments 
and operations and maintenance resources would be needed. 
The average required was estimated at US$1.9 billion globally 
each year between 2010 and 2030, and US$7.6 billion each year 
between 2031 and 2050. The improved access to drinking water 
and sanitation would also lead to other major benefits: Hutton 
and Haller (2004) estimate that every dollar spent on drinking 
water and sanitation creates economic returns of US$12–34, 
depending on the region and the technology. Three-quarters of 
these benefits stem from decreased collection time, particularly 
for women and especially when water is piped to premises, while 
the other benefits are mostly linked to a reduction in water-borne 
disease and death, such as from diarrhoea. The OECD (2012) 
projects total avoided deaths of around 81 000 per year in 2050. 
Possible policy levers to improve access to safe drinking water 
and reduce water stress include: 
•	 investing	in	research,	development	and	training	to	increase	

irrigation efficiency;

•	 controlling	the	extent	of	irrigated	areas;
•	 using	waste	water	and	desalinated	water	to	conserve	

freshwater resources; 

•	 reusing	water	in	manufacturing	industries;
•	 investing	in	devices	and	processes	for	reusing	grey	water	

(wastewater from domestic activities);

•	 investing	in	education	to	raise	awareness	of	the	need	to	

save water and the link between unsafe drinking water and 
disease;

•	 investing	in	infrastructure	for	accessing	safe	water	and	for	

collecting and purifying waste water;

•	 reducing	the	use	of	cooling	water	in	the	generation	of	

electricity; and

•	 developing	adaptation	and	mitigation	policies	to	reduce	

climate change impacts.

As agriculture is the largest user of water worldwide, water stress 
and food security are strongly interrelated. Lack of sufficient 
water, possibly caused by alternative water use, can limit food 
production; at the same time, water consumption for agricultural 
production could limit residential and industrial water supply. 

These relationships further emphasize the need for integrated 
resource planning at the level of water basins. 

Terrestrial biodiversity 
Conventional world scenarios
Different scenario studies and assessments have considered 
biodiversity loss (CBD 2010b, 2006; UNEP 2007; van Vuuren et 
al. 2006; MA 2005a; Sala et al. 2000), including information on 
extinction rates, changes in forest cover and changes in species 
abundance and distribution (Leadley et al. 2010). An important 
element of future biodiversity loss is land-use change (Figure 
16.13), with particularly important trends including the loss of 
mangroves, wetlands and tropical forests (CBD 2010b). Scenarios 
indicate a further decline of tropical forests, while the area of 
temperate forests is likely to expand. Another factor affecting 
biodiversity is natural asset exploitation: an increasing population 
with rising affluence in the conventional world scenarios implies, 
for example, greater demand for forest and tree products. 
Currently, most timber products are extracted from natural forests, 
while plantations provide some 35 per cent of harvested wood 
(Sohngen et al. 2001). The increased timber demand is expected 
to lead to a further expansion of managed forest in tropical zones, 
at the expense of unmanaged forests (Gibson et al. 2011). 

Projections of extinction rates vary widely between studies. 
Those based on species/area relationships lead to relatively 
high extinction rates, whereas species distribution models that 

allow for migration generate much lower rates. However, all 
estimates of future extinction rates are considerably higher than 
is considered sustainable. Conservative estimates of future rates 
of extinction expect them to be similar to the currently high rates 
(Pereira et al. 2010). 

Sustainable world scenarios
It has been shown that the expansion of agricultural land could 
be avoided by increasing crop yields combined with policies to 
reduce food waste, control biofuel use, conserve resources and 
shift diets (Figure 16.14) (Ten Brink et al. 2010; Stehfest et al. 
2009; Wise et al. 2009). Analysis has also shown that the 2020 
target to prevent the extinction of known threatened species 
could be achieved by a well chosen network of protected areas 
in combination with reduced habitat loss (Butchart et al. 2012; 
Ricketts et al. 2005). In a recent study, a combination of policy 
options – including the expansion of protected areas into a 
well-chosen network covering 29 per cent of the world’s surface, 
an increase in agricultural productivity and reduced post-
harvest losses, dietary change, improved forest management, 
and climate mitigation – suggested a significant restoration 
of natural areas and reduced biodiversity loss (Ten Brink et al. 
2010). A great impact on land-use change could also be achieved 
through financial mechanisms: Wise et al. (2009) demonstrated 
that a policy that provided equal monetary incentives to reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions to all emission sources, including 
land use, could lead to the preservation of both managed and

unmanaged forest. Other measures that could also be considered 
include agroforestry and the certification of sustainable wood 
products (Angelsen 2010). 

A critical threat to biodiversity is rising demand for agricultural 
land leading to conversion of natural habitats, whereas a 
substantial increase in yields reduces the demand for land 
and is considered necessary to reduce habitat loss. This may, 
however, cause a decline in the biodiversity and ecosystem 
services of farmlands (Robinson and Sutherland 2002; 
Tilman et al. 2002) but an increase in biodiversity across the 
landscape (Phalan et al. 2011). An expansion of protected 
areas may increase competition for land, decreasing the 
potential for agricultural production, which could in turn lead  
to higher food prices.

Aquatic biodiversity
Conventional world scenarios
Conventional world projections of changes in the biodiversity 
of aquatic ecosystems are scarce; however, pressures are 
expected to remain high as a result of increasing water scarcity, 
climate change, pollution and exploitation (CBD 2010b; Rands 
et al. 2010). For freshwater systems, organic pollution and 
dam construction are important threats. For marine systems, 
destructive and intensive fisheries and ocean acidification are 
among the main factors that could reduce biodiversity 
(Halpern et al. 2008; Pinnegar et al. 2006; Pauly et al. 2003). 
Ocean acidification may transform coral reefs into systems 
dominated by other species, and will cause major disruptions 
in marine food webs, especially in the Southern Ocean (McNeil 
and Matear 2008). 

About 32 per cent of wild marine fish populations are classified 
as collapsed, depleted or recovering (FAO 2010), and while 
there has been some rebuilding in areas with strong fisheries

management (Worm et al. 2009), the majority of the world’s 
fisheries are operating with severe overcapacity (Anticamara et al. 
2011) resulting in significant economic losses (Arnason et al. 
2009; Srinivasan et al. 2012). Global assessments for exploited 
marine invertebrates indicate similar trends (Purcell et al. 2011).

the abundance of large fish and caused local extinctions. 
Analysis indicates that global wild fish catches will decrease 
in the future unless fishing effort and catch rates are reduced 
to sustainable levels (Figure 16.15). Projections also show that 
if current trends persist, the populations of medium and larger 
fish in the world’s oceans will continue to decrease while small 
fish may increase in abundance due to release from predation 
(Ten Brink et al. 2010; Pauly et al. 2003).

Sustainable world scenarios
Reducing fishing effort, even to the level of maximum sustainable 
yields for all fish populations, could make an important 
difference for a sustainable world. It would require a stringent 
reduction, but only temporarily while larger- and medium-sized 
fish populations recover (Ten Brink et al. 2010; Pauly et al. 2003). 
After this period, fishing could return to a level that can be 
sustained in the long run. 

Increasing the protected area of land and sea would reduce 
the availability of suitable land and fishing grounds for food 
production. Increasing protection will only therefore be effective 
if it is done in combination with more efficient production 
methods on the land under cultivation and the establishment of 
sustainable fisheries. It should also be noted that reduced fishing 
effort initially leads to reduced fish landings. This implies that 
while populations rebuild, demand for wild-caught fish needs to 
be replaced by demand for aquaculture – which itself has specific 
environmental impacts – or crop and animal products. As fish 
populations rebuild, the supply of fish would, however, grow to a 
long-term sustainable level that is comparable to the peak 1980s 
catch levels (Ten Brink et al. 2010; Pauly et al. 2003).

Synthesis: gaps and sustainability pathways
The review of conventional world and sustainable world 
scenarios in relation to the strategic goals discussed earlier in 
the chapter illustrates that continuing on the current trajectory 
would lead to major environmental damage and a serious loss 
of ecosystem services by 2050. It would also leave many people 
without sustainable access to food, water and energy. In contrast, 
the sustainable world scenarios show how societies could 
meet some of the 2050 targets or, at least, join a trajectory that 
would make meeting such targets more feasible. The changes 
suggested in the sustainable world scenarios include all kinds 
of measures related to greater technological implementation, 
changes in consumption patterns and improved management. 
In general, major shifts from current trends are required for 
each specific issue. It should be noted that, due to inertia in the 
human-environment system, several targets still imply significant 
environmental change, such as the target to limit temperature 
increase to 2oC above pre-industrial levels. Sustainable world 
scenarios, as well as requiring mitigating measures, call for 
measures to cope with or adapt to these adverse effects. 

Table 16.3 presents an overview of the key measures suggested 
in the thematic sections of GEO-5, including changes in 
consumption and production levels and patterns. On the 
production side, changes include improving efficiency and 
using fewer inputs; input switching and producing with low- or 
non-polluting inputs; end-of-pipe measures; and integrated 
production systems. On the consumption side, changes consist 
of alterations in lifestyle, such as dietary shifts and greater use 
of public transport. A focus on education, including awareness 
raising, investment in infrastructure and the creation or

Scenarios and Sustainability Transformation   441

strengthening of markets, and adaptation to unmitigated change 
are other measures included in the sustainable world scenarios. 
Measures can also be related to the layers of transformation 

in Figure 16.2: while many measures address the outer layer, 
others deal with the mid or even deep layers, such as changes in 
behaviour, mainly the result of education and awareness raising.

Box 16.4 Integrated global analysis of sustainability scenarios

The scenario assessments address gaps and sustainability 
pathways by theme, as well as the potential trade-offs and 
co-benefits with the other themes. It is, however, important 
to further analyse the links between themes in an integrated 
manner. Here, the global Threshold 21 (T21) model (Bassi et 
al. 2010) is used to address how to achieve the goals set out 
in Table 16.1 by focusing on the investments needed and the 
trade-offs and synergies of the interventions across various 
sectors. Two alternative sustainable world scenarios to 2050 are 
compared to a conventional world scenario. Scenario A focuses 
entirely on additional investments in transforming technology 
and production to achieve the goals. Scenario B focuses on how 
adding lifestyle change reduces those investments. 

Scenario A shows that investments of about 2 per cent of 
GDP between 2011 and 2050 will make the necessary shift to 
sustainable development. The interventions include efforts to 
reduce energy demand in buildings, industry and transport (38 per 
cent of investments); shifting to more renewable energy sources 
(31 per cent); increasing food production through ecological 
agricultural practices (10 per cent); rebuilding fishery stocks (8 
per cent); and sustainable management of forests (3 per cent) 
and water (10 per cent). Thus, achieving the climate goal emerges 
as requiring the highest investment. The measures in the energy 
and agriculture sector reduce greenhouse gas emissions to a level 
that limits atmospheric concentrations below 450 ppm. In T21, 
managing natural resources more sustainably also helps restore 
key natural resources or greatly mitigate their depletion (Table 

16.4). Scenario B shows that lifestyle changes that reduce demand 
for energy, including for transport, heating and cooling, water and 
biomass, will reduce the need for investments in production and 
technology to about 1.2 per cent of GDP. It should be noted that 
the costs of the lifestyle changes are not accounted for and will at 
least involve the costs of transmission of information. 

In both scenarios, the synergies from the additional investments 
focused on environmental sustainability and on reducing 
the stress that natural resource depletion puts on economic 
productivity. Overall, the macro-economic results of the T21 
model show that investing to reach the sustainability goals 
creates more jobs than a conventional world scenario and 
leads to higher GDP growth. The shift to greener investment will 
lead to slightly lower growth rates in initial years, as is usual 
for transition investments, but A and B scenarios’ GDP will 
pass business-as-usual projections well before 2030 (UNEP 
2011c). This is a significant, but uncertain, result as some 
other models show negative GDP impacts, depending on the 
assumed cost of fossil fuels and renewable alternatives, the 
impacts of environmental change and responses to increases in 
investments (Bassi and Eaton 2011; Clarke et al. 2010; Fisher 
et al. 2007). Taking account of the cross-sectoral impacts of an 
integrated approach, such as synergies between agriculture 
and forestry, enables further understanding of the complexity 
underlying mutual socio-economic and environmental 
dependence and the need for coordinated programmes and 
investments to achieve the GEO-5 goals.

Scenarios and Sustainability Transformation   443

There are important synergies between the different goals. 
For example, reduced climate change would improve water 
availability and crop yields as well as relieve pressure on 
biodiversity. Decreased consumption of food, water and fossil 
fuels would reduce the mitigation requirements to achieve 
the biodiversity, water stress and climate change objectives, 
while increased agricultural yields would lessen the pressure 
on biodiversity. In some cases, however, options for a specific 
theme may induce important trade-offs with other themes. 
Policies that combat environmental degradation may have 
impacts on human development, and vice versa: creating bio-
reserves, for example, may increase land and food prices, while 
desalinating water would significantly increase the demand 
for energy. Ignoring such cross-sectoral links might jeopardize 
the success of the sustainability transition effort and lead 
to significant delays in reaching the targets. Strategies must 
therefore go beyond theme-oriented conventional thinking and 
take a broader systemic view that reflects these links. Central 
to this is how the measures introduced for the different themes 
would work together. Box 16.4 describes an example of an 
analysis in which integrated scenarios are explored. This shows 
that it is indeed possible to identify pathways that would meet 
multiple sustainable development targets.

ADVANCING SUSTAINABILITY
Given the massive gap between conventional and sustainable 
worlds in 2050, it is clear that inertia is a principal obstacle – in 
the form of dominant unsustainable processes, structures and 
habits. Moving off the current path will require a transformation 

without precedent in human history (Steffen et al. 2005; 
Takács-Sánta 2004). Guiding changes of such magnitude 
and complexity will require time and patience to facilitate a 
sometimes steady, sometimes fitful, transition process. During 
this process, structures and underlying mental models need 
to be evaluated – some phased out and others energetically 
phased in. These underlying models should be consistent with 
the desired trajectory for targets relating to atmosphere and 
climate, land, water and biodiversity, resource efficiency and 
waste management. The changes must effectively transform 
society’s material metabolism, especially those elements and 
dynamics currently locking countries into trajectories that 
are not the ones they would prefer. The changes needed to 
realize sustainable world trajectories have to be diverse and 
should combine demographic, technological, governance and 
investment measures, along with lifestyle changes resulting 
from shifting mindsets towards dematerialized values. They 
also need to provide sufficient leverage to break the inertia of 
unsustainable trends.

Diversity is key to understanding the structure and function of 
complex adaptive systems and enhancing their resilience to 
stress (Innes et al. 2005). A diversity of potential responses is 
required because effective interventions must be sensitive to 
socio-cultural and environment-development contexts. Diversity 
also helps strengthen resilience and provides a form of insurance 
if some of the responses fail, as many have over the last few 
decades with regard to biodiversity, climate and other key 
environmental issues (Speth 2005).

Part 3: Global Responses

Grounding responses in local processes and experience not only 
builds diversity, it can also tap into knowledge that has evolved 
in direct connection with a particular environment. This section 
focuses on the sub-global level, where countries, communities 
or other entities, when addressing environmental problems from 
the perspective of a particular place, self-organize their response 
mechanisms. The self-organizing potential of communities, 
businesses, civil society and other actors can be strengthened 
by building networks, by matching the scale of governance to the 
scale of the ecosystem in question, and by promoting innovation 
and action (Berkes et al. 2003).

Paying attention to how response measures interact with, support 
or constrain each other is difficult but increasingly important. The 
significance of this in the case of ecosystem services has been 
recognized and may involve the reduction of one to enhance 
another, for example sacrificing the potential value of mining to 
optimize a forest’s carbon sequestration or biodiversity value – 
or vice versa (Rodríguez et al. 2006). At the same time, a diversity 
of measures offers increased opportunities for finding synergies 
and supporting measures that produce multiple benefits (UNEP 
2011b), such as the carbon sequestration and biodiversity co-
benefits of forest conservation. 

While responses at the sub-global level are likely to be diverse 
and grounded in local conditions, it is important to identify some 
common strategic elements for advancing sustainability. This 
section discusses four strategic elements: 
•	 compelling	visions	and	social	contracts;
•	 reversing	the	unsustainable;
•	 leverage	points;	and
•	 adaptive	management	and	governance.

Such strategic elements inform and guide the development and 
implementation of specific policy measures under the widest 
range of geographic and thematic conditions, across all scales 
from the local to the national and regional. In some cases 
they also apply at the global level, with implications for the 
international priority responses discussed in Chapter 17.

Social consensus around compelling visions of 
sustainability
Initiating and managing the transition towards internationally 
agreed goals and targets requires setting well-defined 
directions through a clearly articulated vision. Governments 
and other organizations at all levels should develop the 
capacity to engage society in expressing cohesive visions 
of an environmentally sustainable future around which new 
social consensus – in the form of deliberately agreed social 
contracts, sectoral and thematic strategies and policies – can 
be developed and implemented.

Based on the experience of public- and private-sector 
organizations, developing visions of an environmentally 
sustainable future is an effective mechanism for achieving 
progress in a desired direction (Costanza 2000). The generation 
of shared visions is not only an essential element, but also 

an underrated element of environmental strategic policy 
development and management (Meadows 1996). Current public 
institutions often have limited capacity to construct legitimate 
and credible visions relying on stakeholders’ inputs (Walker et 
al. 2006). This has also been recognized by the Global Survey 
on Sustainable Lifestyles, which concluded that the missing 
links between global environmental challenges and individual 
action are pragmatic, holistic and compelling visions of what 
sustainable societies could look like (UNEP 2011c). 

In the absence of a clear, coherent vision that reflects the links 
between social, economic and environmental issues, policies 
may lead to disadvantageous trade-offs, often sacrificing 
environmental or social goals in the face of more quantifiable 
economic objectives. The result is often addressing one 
sustainability problem while passing the true cost to another 
sector, community, region or even another generation, creating 
even more persistent and complex risks in the long term 
(Loorbach and Rotmans 2005). 

Visioning is important both for exploring the broader implications 
of the effort needed for simultaneously meeting internationally 
agreed global goals and targets, and for discussing 
environmental futures from strategic sub-global points of view 
under different economic, social and ecological conditions. 
The power of visions to provide direction, navigate pathways, 
recognize solutions and explore uncertainty has been recognized 
and illustrated by the growing number of sub-global efforts 
that involve articulating a vision or outlook for the future. Some 
prominent examples follow. 
•	 Regional	projection	of	options	for	resource	efficiency	

improvements. UNEP and regional partners prepared an 
outlook to explore how resource efficiency improvements 
can help maintain ecosystem health and contribute to the 
provision of essential ecosystem services in the rapidly 
industrializing economies of Asia and the Pacific (UNEP 
2011b).

•	 Scenario	visioning	at	the	state	and	city	level.	A combination 

of qualitative visioning and quantitative modelling 
methods, involving extensive participation, has been used 
in Minnesota, United States. The purpose of the process 
was to help regional leaders make strategic decisions about 
sustainability, to identify related knowledge and research 
gaps and to introduce systems thinking into policy making 
and planning (Schmitt-Olabisi et al. 2010). An innovative 
100-year vision has been developed for Panjim, the capital 
of the Indian state of Goa and surrounding areas, around the 
concept of “RUrbanism”, an integration of urban and rural 
development in terms of resource use and the convergence of 
human well-being (Revi et al. 2006).

•	 Visions	focused	on	solutions	to	specific	environmental	

problems. A vision has been developed to tackle the acute 
water shortages in Kuwait (Al-Damkhi et al. 2009). Pathways 
of possible emission reduction and low-carbon futures have 
been developed for specific regions in Europe (Matthes et al. 
2006) and cities in North America (Metro City of Vancouver 
2011; Danish Architecture Centre 2011).

Scenarios and Sustainability Transformation   445

The development of visions involves creative tensions between 
quantitative model-based projections and qualitative normative 
articulation of what is desired for the future (Schmitt-Olabisi  
et al. 2010; Patel et al. 2007; Strauss 1987). A vision refers to  
a moving target, guiding the self-organizing and innovative 
forces of a society – forces that otherwise would remain diffuse. 
A vision differs from a goal; it is a tangible image of a future that 
is not subjected to the exact definitions involved in setting and 
achieving goals (Jaeger et al. 2000).

When developing visions, it is essential to ensure integration 
across policy themes to capture the intricately linked ecological, 
social, economic, ethical and institutional dimensions of 
sustainability problems, while reflecting on uncertainty – 
including surprise, critical thresholds and abrupt change, which 
are inherent in non-linear natural and social systems such as 
the Earth System (Swart et al. 2004). The visioning process 
should also account for human decisions as a key conditioning 
factor – the constitution, reproduction and reformulation of 
human needs, wants, vulnerabilities and values is essential for 
illuminating consumption, social goals, institutional innovation, 
social learning and the prospects for alternative futures 
(Robinson 2004; Swart et al. 2004). 

Participatory, integrated visioning processes are most useful 
when they are iterative, support policy development and 
adaptation, and are embedded in institutional cultures with 
adequate capacity to manage the process. Embedding elements 
of a vision in institutions can take place through legal and 
administrative means. However, creating and maintaining the 
political will that makes such measures feasible requires more – 
as does recruiting society to adopt lifestyle changes included in 
the sustainability scenarios elaborated above. 

According to the German Advisory Council on Global Change, 
formalizing the transition agenda to a low-carbon economy can 
be achieved in the form of new social contracts (WBGU 2011). 
The council argues that the need for such contracts is grounded 
in the joint responsibility of states and their global communities 
– business, science, civil society and even individuals – for 
tackling threats to the stability of the Earth System, with changes 
going beyond technical and bureaucratic reforms. Formulated 
around positive visions of the future, a new form of interaction 
between politics, society, the economy and science would need 
to be defined to bring creativity, resources, capacity, legitimacy 
and political will together in the interest of navigating the 
transition and achieving tangible progress towards outcomes 
consistent with such visions. 

A social contract is a contract or agreement between people 
to form a society that determines their moral and/or political 
obligations. With Socrates being its earliest known proponent 
in antiquity, the concept is almost as old as philosophy. Social 
contracts can exist in different forms at different levels, and 
can outline different obligations for specific stakeholders. For 
example, a social contract for science would need to focus on 
the commitment of the scientific community to systematically 

apply its creativity to addressing the fundamental problems 
of the Earth System and the public’s interests therein 
(Lubchenco 1998). But social contracts could take other forms 
in other sectors. Standards with a focus on the sustainability 
of products and processes in sectors such as forestry or 
agriculture have been proposed as a form of social contract, 
with the state providing an overall operating framework but 
with non-govenmental organizations, businesses and consumer 
associations working out and codifying the details (Giovannucci 
and Ponte 2005).

Social contracts would need to address both short-term and 
long-term issues. The Stockholm Memorandum of Nobel 
Prize Winners called for a dual-track approach: short-term 
actions, emergency solutions to address the most pressing 
environmental trends and their drivers within today’s faulty 
institutional framework; and long-term changes focused on 
transforming the institutional framework itself, to create an 
environment for innovation, learning and action without the 
barriers of today. In the short term, they call for focus on 
achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), and 
in the long run for a new agreement between developed and 
developing countries to scale up the investment and capacity 
building necessary to reach those goals (Royal Swedish 
Academy of Sciences 2011).

Reversing the unsustainable 
The transition towards internationally agreed sustainability 
goals and targets requires not only introducing innovative new 
measures and policies, but also the rapid phasing out of policies 
and practices that reinforce vested interests that prevent the 
transition from happening.

Learning what not to do is a necessary, yet often neglected, 
precondition to framing the improvement of sustainability and, in 
particular, to the integrated sustainable governance of complex 
social-ecological systems. Understanding the constraints and 
opportunities for bringing such framing into science, education 
and policy debate while avoiding simple ideological discussions 
is essential in advancing to a sustainable world (Tàbara and 
Pahl-Wostl 2007). However, phasing out existing policies and 
practices is not always easy. Policies create dependencies, 
and discontinuing a policy may hurt economic and other 
vested interests and result in adjustments. Yet discontinuing 
unsustainable policies and practices may also free up resources 
and create new niches that innovative measures, consistent with 
the sustainable world trajectory, can fill. 

One important area for the phasing out of existing unsustainable 
measures is counterproductive government subsidies. These are a 
widespread phenomenon encouraging unsustainable activities in 
sectors such as agriculture, energy and transport (van Beers and 
van den Bergh 2009). A subsidy is a “payment by a government 
to an individual or firm, the intent of which, theoretically, is to 
decrease the divergence between social costs and benefits – to 
internalize externalities” (Myers and Kent 2001).
Subsidies can produce socially desirable outcomes, such as 

446

Part 3: Global Responses

provision of a public good that would be undersupplied by the 
market. When properly designed and applied, they can also 
provide investment to help green industry or technology start-
ups become economically competitive (Bagstad et al. 2007). 
However, not all subsidies help progress towards agreed goals 
and targets. There are so-called “perverse” subsidies that 
increase the divergence between private and social costs and 
benefits (Myers and Kent 2001), typically by increasing the 
size and pollution intensity of economic activities, and often 
without clear, compensating social benefits but with economic 
benefits channelled to a small minority of entrenched interests 
in business-as-usual (van Beers and van den Bergh 2009, 2001). 
Examples include:
•	 agricultural	subsidies	that	encourage	the	intensification	of	
production or the expansion of farmland at the expense of 
natural ecosystems; without precautions, such measures 
often lead to significant negative impacts on biodiversity and 
habitats (Robin et al. 2003); 

•	 fossil	fuel	subsidies	increase	greenhouse	gas	emissions	and	

thus contribute to climate change; while these subsidies 
are often designed to keep energy costs lower for the poor, 
they typically end up benefiting medium- to high-income 
households: in 2008, for example, the Indonesian Ministry 
of Economic Affairs concluded that the top 40 per cent of 
high-income families benefited from 70 per cent of the 
subsidies, while the bottom 40 per cent of low-income 
families from only 15 per cent of them (IISD GSI 2011; 
IEA 2008);

•	 subsidies	for	road	transport,	in	which	subsidized	road	

construction directly destroys habitat, and burning 
subsidized fossil fuels in motor vehicles is a major 
contributor to air pollution and climate change (Myers and 
Kent 2001). 

Discontinuing existing unsustainable practices may be a long 
and uneasy process, but does lead to a shift to sustainable 
behaviour. An example of reversing the unsustainable can be 
observed in marine fisheries through the implementation of the 
Wellington Convention signed in 1989, which prohibits fishing 
with long driftnets in the South Pacific. This type of fishing is 
destructive because of its non-selectiveness and the high level of 
by-catch. Driftnet fishing was widely used, especially during the 
1980s, and posed a threat to fish stocks, in particular to albacore 
tuna. Although the convention initially created tension among 
the distant-water fishing nations, it managed to balance the 
economic interests of fisheries with the pressure on the marine 
environment and led to the adoption of a global moratorium on 
full driftnet fishing on the high seas (Techera 2011; Hewison 
1993). The International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling 
(ICRW), which originally aimed to prevent the oversupply of whale 
products but turned into a key instrument of whale conservation 
(Maffei 1997), can stand as another example. The governance 
regime for whales has contributed to more sustainable 
practices and a change in mindsets, allowing a transition from 
predominantly consumptive exploitation of a natural resource 
(whaling) to non-consumptive use such as whale watching and 
related tourism. 

Sustainability not only requires being aware of complexities 
and uncertainties, but also developing normative patterns 
of knowledge creation and collective behaviour that render 
action possible (Mangalagiu et al. 2011). A transition to 
sustainability demands profound changes in understanding, 
interpretative frameworks and broader cultural values, just 
as it requires transformations in the practices, institutions 
and social structures that regulate and coordinate individual 
behaviour. In this context, it is essential to get to the position 
where people, industry and governments can easily distinguish 
between objective facts and opinions that are presented as 
facts to advance particular interests, and rely on the former to 
make informed decisions. This is where education becomes 
paramount, and involves raising awareness of the challenges 
and solutions as well as harnessing and communicating  
diverse knowledge.

Scenarios and Sustainability Transformation   447

Reversing or phasing out unsustainable policies and practices is 
essential. But it is only a first step that must be accompanied by 
investment in investigating solutions that incorporate traditional 
knowledge and novel forms of sustainability science as well as 
engaging with broader civil society (Bäckstrand 2003). Reversing 
unsustainable practices must be accompanied by providing 
society with knowledge and practices that are consistent with 
management within planetary means. 

Applying leverage
Achieving internationally agreed goals and targets will require 
that policy makers look for advantageous places to intervene 
and apply leverage through the design and implementation of a 
diverse array of policies and instruments that: 
•	 facilitate	a	mindset	shift	to	align	with	sustainability	

principles; 

•	 change	the	rules	and	incentives	to	advance	sustainable	

practices; and 

•	 create	feedback	and	make	adjustments	to	keep	

environmental pressures in check.

The comparison of conventional and sustainable world 
scenarios brings into focus the challenge at hand: an urgent 
need for a societal system-wide shift in the way energy is 
generated and used, in consumption patterns, and in natural 
resource management – to quickly adjust the pathway towards 
sustainability – in the context of an unstable global economy 
and present underachievement of most of the MDGs. In short, 
there is neither time nor money to waste. However, the crisis of 
sustainability may help increase awareness and understanding 
of the problem, its underlying causes and the relationship 
between them, and create momentum. Future policy efforts must 
be as efficient and effective as humanly possible: by specifically 
addressing the deeply embedded underlying drivers and 
targeting and coordinating progress towards long-term change. 

Progress toward deep transformation will not be rapid, but 
evidence of change and progress at levels less deeply embedded 
in the system will help create the conditions that support 
and assist deep level change. What is emphasized here is the 
importance of constructing a diversified portfolio of policy 
intervention at levels that are fairly easy to access and influence, 
in conjunction with other interventions which involve deeper 
analysis, coordination and structural change.

Three layers of transformation were introduced in Figure 16.2 
where leverage points might be found, providing practical 
guidance for policy makers in managing the sustainability 
transition. Reflecting on the presence or absence of intervention 
at each of these leverage points can help broaden and diversify 
policy emphasis, leading to a more resilient and responsive 
overall strategy. Several examples follow, beginning with those 
that are at the core of the sustainability transition. 

Shift mindsets
At the core of the sustainability transition lie critical reflection and 
changes in the mindsets and goals that determine how issues 

themselves are framed. Mindsets in this respect refers both to 
those held by individuals and to those shared mindsets that 
define how social groups, cultures, nations or the human species 
at large approach things. Recognizing the importance of mindsets 
in the sustainability transition allows an opportunity to reflect 
and examine underlying assumptions, identify shared values and 
cultivate common ground. Each of these contributes to defining 
the shared goals and the compelling visions necessary to bring 
these changes about. Consider the following examples:
•	 Youth	education	for	sustainable	development.	Introducing 

the principles of sustainability at an early and formative 
age in primary and secondary school supports the power of 
complex problem solving and can instil the belief that change 
is possible and preferable, and that a sustainable world is 
indeed achievable. The United Nations Decade of Education 
for Sustainable Development (UNESCO 2011) is an example 
of a global response meant to facilitate national and sub-
national efforts in this regard. Policy interventions that help 
schools integrate sustainability into curriculums have the 
potential to change mindsets. 

•	 Social	marketing. While the world is replete with 

advertisements for products and services, there is a dearth of 
public messaging to promote the principles of sustainability 
and non-material aspects of well-being such as health, 
leisure or time with friends and family. Changes in the rules 
and ethics of advertising and marketing that match the 
audience-reach of product and service advertising, but that 
communicate critical behavioural change for a sustainable 
future – such as water and energy conservation or the use of 
green products – have the potential to change mindsets. 

•	 Beyond	GDP. Nobel prize-winning economists Joseph 

Stiglitz and Amartya Sen were commissioned by President 
Nicholas Sarkozy of France to examine the measurement of 
economic performance and social progress. The Stiglitz-Sen 
Commission called for a shift in emphasis from measuring 
economic production to measuring people’s well-being and 
the sustainability of that well-being (Stiglitz et al. 2009). 
They stressed the importance of measuring such aspects 
as the state of health, education, personal activities, 
environmental conditions, social connections and political 
voice, as well as insecurity, inequalities and proximity to 
dangerous levels of environmental damage. An example of 
the type of transformation that such a change in mindset 
represents is Bhutan’s Gross National Happiness Index and 
the national priority to focus on increasing happiness rather 
than merely focusing on perpetual GDP growth (Government 
of Bhutan 2011).

Change the rules and incentives
Coordinating deep and enduring system change is neither a 
single pathway nor a linear process. For example, the rules of 
a system often arise from a change in mindset, but in turn help 
support mindset shifts. At this level of system intervention the 
emphasis is on getting the signals right. Because rules and 
incentives can institute structural change, they represent the 
game changers that can catalyse and retain a strong influence on 
system behaviour over time.

Policy instruments such as laws, taxes, subsidies and market 
mechanisms can be directed to shift specific drivers that affect 
the state of the environment, and the more influential the driver, 
the more systemic the change can be. Some instruments that are 
already in place in many jurisdictions, such as pollution charges, 
can create direct incentives for the reduction of emissions. 
Other measures, however, with potentially more far-reaching 
impacts, may require and represent a deeper mind-shift. For 
example, payment for ecosystem services schemes include a 
suite of approaches that attempt to attach value to ecological 
functions that are usually left out of cost-benefit calculations 
and mainstream economic models, including direct public and 
private payments (Milder et al. 2010). Payment for ecosystem 
services has been advanced for example in Latin America and the 
Caribbean (Wunder 2007), and China has implemented some of 
the largest schemes in the world (ADB 2010).

Create feedback and make adjustments
Interventions aimed at less structurally embedded parts of a 
system can contribute to the sustainability transition, especially 
when they catalyse mass action. Interventions that strengthen 
feedback are designed to “deliver information to a place where 
it wasn’t going before and therefore causing people to behave 
differently” (Meadows 1999). Such feedback provides the 
evidence base for the mitigation of environmental pressures. 
Examples include:
•	 Household	water	and	energy	metering.	A digital household 

meter for electricity and water consumption can have a 

significant impact on individual behaviour. In Armenia, for 
example, studies on water consumption soon after meter 
installation revealed that on average water use decreased 
three to four times (OECD 2008b).

•	 Product	labelling.	Providing information such as the carbon 

footprint of products, or forest or marine stewardship 
certification, can influence consumer behaviour and lead 
to transformation across sectors. For example, the Marine 
Stewardship Council (MSC) provides certification standards 
and requirements for sustainable seafood. As of 2011 there 
were 133 MSC-certified fisheries representing almost 6 per 
cent of the total wild fish catch (MSC 2011).

•	 Community	indicator	systems. Communities that undertake 

multi-stakeholder processes to identify priority aspects 
of quality of life and indicators to track progress over 
time, create important feedback loops that can influence 
collaborative action and transformation in communities. 
In a 2011 study (US-GAO 2011), the US Government 
Accountability Office highlighted that community indicator 
systems are a “vehicle for encouraging civic engagement 
both through the system’s development process and 
through action once the indicator system is in place”; “help 
address community or national challenges by facilitating 
collaboration of various parties inside and outside 
of government”; and “provide solutions to long-term 
challenges”. One example from Nevada’s Reno and Sparks 
communities is Truckee Meadows Tomorrow, Quality of Life 
Indicators (TMT 2011).

Scenarios and Sustainability Transformation   449

Adaptive governance
Recognizing that humanity is encroaching on critical planetary 
boundaries, new modes of adaptive governance are needed 
to initiate transition management and achieve internationally 
agreed goals and targets.

This analysis has demonstrated that the transition path 
towards a sustainable world scenario is feasible but requires 
navigating a wide range of highly complex and interrelated issues 
simultaneously. Contextually, society’s pursuit of well-being 
and the requisite use of natural resources is a complex adaptive 
system, where different systems interact and adapt to one another, 
giving rise to the emergent ability of both people and ecosystems 
to self-organize in response to sudden shocks and more slowly 
changing stresses (Liu et al. 2007). Such a system is never at 
a standstill, but rather is in a constant process of incremental 
adaptation, reconfiguration, modification, revision and re-ordering, 
where long periods of stability or equilibrium are visited by short 
periods of radical change (Grin et al. 2010; Loorbach 2007). 

In such unpredictable settings, it is nearly impossible to create 
a fail-proof blueprint or to formulate optimal policies. What is 
required instead is an inclusive, learn-by-doing process with 
careful monitoring of policy effects, and an ability to make critical 
choices and improvements consistent with the trajectories 
leading to established goals. Society has already experienced 
the inadequacies of inflexible blueprint-style approaches and is 
gaining both experience and insights into alternative strategies 
and policies that are more adaptive and that help build resilience. 
Resilience thinking puts three aspects of social-ecological systems 
at the centre: resilience, adaptability and transformability. 
Resilience refers to the capacity of a system – such as a country 
or an ecosystem – to adapt to change, deal with surprise, and 
retain its basic function and structure while remaining within 
critical boundaries. Adaptability – part of resilience – represents 
the capacity to adjust responses to changing external drivers 
and internal processes, and thereby channel development along 
the preferred trajectory in what is called a stability domain. 
Transformability is the capacity to cross thresholds, enter new 
development trajectories, abandon unsustainable actions and 
chart better pathways to established targets (Folke et al. 2010). 

There are different related approaches emerging that put 
these concepts into practice, including adaptive management, 
sustainability transition management, adaptive governance and 
adaptive policy making. They each have common features as well 
as different niches and scales in which they are relevant. The 
adaptive management approach, pioneered in the 1980s and 
1990s (Lee 1993; Holling 1978), offers practical and experience-
based guidance for the type of skilful navigation that would be 
necessary for local and regional place-based natural resource 
management efforts. 

Recommendations for managing the transition to sustainability, 
resilience thinking and intervening in complex adaptive systems all 
provide governance-level insights (Grin et al. 2010; Loorbach 2007; 
Berkes et al. 2003; Rihani 2002; Ruitenbeek and Cartier 2001; 

Axelrod and Cohen 2000). In relation to the design and 
implementation of adaptive policy instruments, there is also an 
array of research and experience with practical applications to 
draw from that embody many of the same principles as adaptive 
management and managing sustainability transitions (Swanson et 
al. 2010; Walker and Marchau 2003; Bankes 2002; Dewey 1927). 
An example of what adaptive governance and policy-making 
entail in relation to watershed management in India is shown 
in Box 16.5. The range of research and experience cited in this 
paragraph reveals a consistent set of critical functions for adaptive 
governance and managing the transition to sustainability, here 
largely adopting the terminology of Loorbach (2007):
•	 Multi-actor	deliberation	and	agenda	building. Many 

stakeholders influence societal change. Governance must, 
therefore, be participatory to recognize advantageous 
leverage points, the levers for change and the correct 
direction to move them; to achieve coherent coalitions for 
creating shared notions of goals and ambitions; and to 
strengthen policy design and implementation.

•	 Futures	analysis	and	long-term	collective	goal	setting. 

Integrated and forward-looking assessments are critical tools 
that inform ongoing processes of change by systematically 
reflecting upon the future and developing shared notions of 
future goals and targets.

Box 16.5 India’s National Watershed Development 
Project for Rainfed Areas (NDWPRA) – adaptive 
governance and policy-making at the sub-national 
level

The objectives of India’s NWDPRA project include: 
•	 sustainable	enhancement	of	agricultural	productivity	and	

production; 

•	 restoration	of	the	ecological	balance	in	degraded	and	

fragile rain-fed ecosystems by greening these areas 
through an appropriate mix of trees, shrubs and grasses; 

•	 reduction	in	regional	disparity	between	irrigated	and	

rain-fed areas; and 

•	 creation	of	sustained	employment	opportunities	for	the	

rural poor.

In Maharashtra, the NDWPRA project launched in 1990/91 
continued through India’s Ninth Five-Year Plan, when it was 
considerably restructured. Greater emphasis was placed 
on decentralization and community participation. In the 
Tenth Five-Year Plan (2002–2007), the state of Maharashtra 
continued to implement the scheme with a participatory 
approach, extending it to 433 micro-watersheds across 33 
districts, with a targeted treatment area of 203 000 hectares. 
The shift towards a decentralized approach contributed to 
improvements in water-management and represents an 
example of adaptive governance.

Part 3: Global Responses

•	 Enabling	self-organization	and	networking. Creating 

opportunities for cooperation and replicating successes, 
ensuring that social capital remains intact, and guaranteeing 
that members of the population are free and able to interact, 
are all fundamental elements of building the capacity of 
actors and policy itself to plan for and adapt to surprises.

•	 Variation,	experimentation	and	innovation. Diversity of 

responses forms a common risk-management approach, and 
continuous reflection and improvement helps to develop a 
context in which innovation for desired change can thrive.

•	 Reflexivity	and	adaptation. Systemic review of past, present  

and future sustainability conditions and policy performance 
through interaction and cooperation with a range of stakeholders 
is critical for continuous improvement and social learning.

These critical functions of sustainability transition management and 
adaptive governance, together with the other strategic elements 
described earlier – social consensus for achieving compelling 
visions, discarding the unsustainable, and applying leverage 
in policy making – provide practical guidance for advancing 
sustainability and achieving internationally agreed targets.

CONCLUSIONS
The envisioned sustainable world aims simultaneously to achieve 
universal human well-being and environmental sustainability at 
global, national, regional and local levels. The vision assumes 
that, by 2050, all people have access to food, safe drinking 
water, improved sanitation and modern sources of energy, all 
within the ecological limits of the planet. 

Without major course correction, however, continuing on the 
current trajectory would lead, by 2050, to major environmental 
damage, a serious loss of ecosystem services, depletion of 
natural resources and many people left without sustainable 
access to food, water or energy. As a consequence, most 
internationally agreed goals and targets would be missed, some 
by a wide margin, particularly those related to climate change, 
biodiversity, water and food security. 

The review of sustainable world scenarios suggests that 
measures can be put in place to help achieve these targets and 
reduce the risk of Earth System changes and negative impacts 
on future human development. Measures at the mid layer of 
transformation, such as rule changes, will not be enough to move 
to a sustainable world pathway. Structural measures and stronger 
policy action are needed to influence both production and 
consumption patterns. Such changes should be both short- and 
long-term, and combine technology, investment and governance 
measures along with lifestyle modifications grounded in a 
mindset shift towards sustainability and equity-based values. 

A transformation of such complexity requires a gradual, but 
steadily strengthening, transition process. During this, there 
is a need to stop activities that pull the Earth System towards 
unsustainability. At the same time, it is important to provide 
resources, build capacity and create an enabling environment for 
all in a way that is consistent with the vision of a sustainable world. 

In its simplest expression, a green economy can be thought of as one 
which is low carbon, resource efficient and socially inclusive.© Ilias Kordelakos

Such a transition requires a high degree of consensus and 
coordination between societal actors with diverse interests 
and working environments. As a first step, broad-based 
social contracts, grounded in jointly developed visions of a 
sustainable future, would be needed to focus people’s attention 
on the future. To ensure coherence among all societal actors, 
contextually sensitive transition pathways can be developed 
and agreed as joint visions of the future that respect social 
responsibility and ensure that the rest of society has sustainable 
access to the resources necessary for well-being. Given that 
systemic changes, both environmental and societal, are 
often slow, long-term goals would help focus investment and 
technological development, induce societal change and engage 
other actors in society. 

The transition process would necessarily be based on adaptive 
management, since uncertainties play a key role in the problems 
of the Earth System. A diversity of measures would provide better 
insurance against wholesale failure on critical issues – due either 
to inherent uncertainties or inadequate implementation – and 
be mutually strengthening. Of course, strategies to achieve the 
targets will necessarily differ between developed and developing 
countries, and between regions, countries, and communities 
within those categories. The momentum of green economy 
initiatives to integrate environmental imperatives into major 
sectors also needs to be sustained and turned into detailed 
work on policy, innovation and practice. Reversing ecosystem 
degradation while meeting the increasing demand for resources 
may seem challenging, but policy measures that help achieve 
environmental goals and targets also have the potential to 
deliver benefits to human well-being.

All this requires political determination and strong governance. 
Questions of how to do it and what kind of global responses and 
institutions would be needed are discussed in Chapter 17.

Scenarios and Sustainability Transformation   457

Main Messages 

Environmental degradation heightens risks 
and reduces opportunities for the advancement 
of human well-being, especially for poor and 
vulnerable populations. Harmful environmental 
changes are taking place in an increasingly 
globalized, industrialized and interconnected world, 
with a growing global population and unsustainable 
production and consumption patterns. The 
degradation of ecosystem services is narrowing 
development opportunities and could threaten 
future human well-being.
 
The prospect for improving human well-being 
is dependent on the capacity of individuals, 
institutions, countries and the global community  
to respond to environmental change. Innovative 
and transformative policies and technologies  
could assist society to overcome current  
barriers to achieving sustainable development. 
A more balanced approach to addressing 
environmental, economic and social concerns 
could also help.

Even though national and regional responses 
have begun to address environmental challenges, 
a polycentric governance approach is needed to 
attain effective, efficient and equitable outcomes. 
This approach recognizes a diversity of settings and 
assumes multiple centres of activity and authority, 
which, given the range of capacity needs, are 
critical to generate adequate responses to 
environmental challenges. 

Environmental responses are attracting greater 
financial flows but these still fall short of the 
resources needed. The Organisation for Economic 
Co-operation and Development countries’ aid 
commitments to the three UN conventions on 
biodiversity, climate and desertification grew from 
US$5.1 billion in 1999 to US$17.4 billion in 2009. 
The same countries allocated US$22.9 billion to 
official development assistance for climate change 
mitigation and adaptation in 2010. Yet, the cost for 
developing countries to adapt to climate change 
alone has been estimated at US$70–US$100 billion 
a year for 2010–2050.

Global responses have a key role to play in 
promoting coordination, integration and  
systemic considerations. They can help set 
goals and develop metrics, support capacity 
enhancement, generate financial resources and 
facilitate the sharing of best practices. At the  
global level, a results-based approach to 
advancing human well-being and environmental 
sustainability could be anchored in the strategies 
and associated response options that follow 
below. The United Nations Conference on 
Sustainable Development (Rio+20) provides an 
opportunity to take stock, assess achievements 
and shortcomings, and begin to stimulate 
transformative global responses. The suggested 
strategies are part of a systemic approach, which 
could highlight barriers and inform adjustments, 
learning and continuous improvement.

Global response options

Framing environmental goals in the context 
of sustainable development, and monitoring 
outcomes. A process could be initiated to 
revisit and extend the Millennium Development 
Goals in the form of sustainable development 
goals centred on human well-being, with 
measurable metrics, keeping in mind the need 
for the coherent and balanced integration of 
environmental, economic and social dimensions. 

Enhancing the effectiveness of global 
institutions. The sustainable development 
agenda could be elevated and mainstreamed 
into the core of decision making within the UN 
system, supported by enhanced cooperation 
with and between environmental, economic 
and social institutions. 

Investing in enhanced capacities for 
addressing environmental change. Delivering 
results will require strengthened national 
capacities to develop, deliver and implement 
strategies to combat environmental 
degradation. A UN system-wide framework for 
capacity building could strengthen the national 
capacities required to implement specific 
multilateral environmental agreements. 

Supporting technological innovation and 
development. Mechanisms from collaborative 

research and development (R&D), knowledge 
platforms and global prize funds for 
environmentally sound technologies could 
be scaled up to accelerate the innovation 
and diffusion of technologies critical to the 
transition to a global green economy. 

Strengthening rights-based approaches 
and access to environmental justice through 
recognition, enforcement and implementation 
in global and regional institutions. Principle 
10 of the Rio Declaration on Environment 
and Development recognizes the importance 
of procedural environmental rights. For 
the past 20 years regional experience has 
demonstrated that such rights provide a basis 
for citizens to participate in safeguarding 
both human and environmental well-being.

Deepening and broadening stakeholder 
engagement. The private sector and civil 
society could be invited to explore the use 
of new information and communications 
technology to build a stakeholder web 
to enhance access to information and 
stakeholder engagement, and to mobilize new 
partnerships. An intergenerational assembly 
could provide an opportunity for future leaders 
and sustainability champions to interact and 
foster a joint vision for a sustainable future.

INTRODUCTION
Global environmental change such as climate change and the 
degradation of ecosystem services is heightening risks and 
reducing opportunities, especially for poor and vulnerable 
populations. Such change is taking place in an increasingly 
globalized, urbanized, interconnected and fast-moving world 
amidst shifting geopolitical power balances. Burgeoning flows 
of goods and services, capital and technology, information and 
labour all fuel a growing global population with implications 
for patterns of consumption and production. The scale and 
persistence of global environmental problems require sustained 
collective efforts to meet internationally agreed goals. Responses 
at national and regional levels are already available, but 
addressing the underlying drivers of global environmental 
degradation, rather than the pressures or symptoms, would 
require the sustained evolution of rules, institutions, economic 
systems and values to transform the current approach to 
environmental management. In addition, adequate and stable 
financial resources, political commitment, knowledge and 
operational capacity are also imperative. But these enabling 
conditions and the requisite governance mechanisms and 
structures vary considerably between regions and countries. 

There is no single, overarching solution to environmental 
challenges. Yet many environmental problems, particularly those 
pertaining to the global commons, can only be addressed through 
collective action. Global responses are also critical for enhancing 
national capacity and facilitating the uptake of solutions among 
nations with regional commonalities. Responses at national 
and global levels interact and generate incremental, structural 
and transformational change (Putnam 1988). The engagement 
of non-state actors at different levels has, for example, fostered 
knowledge exchange and strengthened capacities. Policy changes 

adopted by individual governments can transmit normative 
signals, exert peer pressure or encourage learning and replication 
– providing incentives for the collective adoption of international 
norms, rules, laws or policies. In several areas – climate, 
biodiversity, chemicals – global environmental treaties have set 
new goals, standards and expectations for state performance. 
The embodiment of these goals and standards in national laws, 
regulations and action plans in turn induces member states to 
comply. Global responses integrating a mix of strategies, values, 
principles, investments and measures supported by a diverse 
range of capacities can enable national and regional choices. 

The capacity of the international community to deliver solutions 
to environmental problems is a function of its ability to establish 
and maintain flexible and holistic governance and management 
frameworks at global and national levels. Ideally, frameworks 
to accomplish these objectives should be based on clear and 
measurable goals, verifiable strategies, and strong monitoring 
and evaluation mechanisms. Adaptive governance is an emerging 
approach for addressing multi-dimensional, ever-evolving 
environmental and socio-economic challenges that exhibit a high 
degree of uncertainty (Gunderson et al. 2010; Dietz et al. 2003); 
and it facilitates decision making in complex systems under the 
circumstances of abrupt, disorganizing or turbulent change (Folke 
et al. 2005). In addition, trust building, involving stakeholder 
participation and mechanisms for feedback, could help ensure 
that change is both sustainable and equitable (Kydd 2005; Levi-
Faur 2005; Braithwaite and Drahos 2000).

Although results-based management is most commonly used to 
manage internal organizational processes, it is a perspective that 
also enhances transparency and accountability when focused 
on international processes. Modified to reflect the global scale,

Part 3: Global Responses

a systematic and comprehensive results-based global approach 
could be anchored in six response options:
•	 framing	environmental	goals	in	the	context	of	sustainable	

development;

•	 enhancing	the	effectiveness	of	global	institutions;
•	 investing	in	enhanced	capacities	for	addressing	

environmental change;

•	 supporting	technological	innovation	and	development;
•	 strengthening	rights-based	approaches	and	access	to	

environmental justice; and

•	 deepening	and	broadening	stakeholder	engagement.

These strategies build on the lessons learned and opportunities 
identified in GEO-5. Aligning goals and strategies within a common 
vision lies at the basis of an integrated approach, which could 
be instrumental in improving the effectiveness and efficiency 
of responses at global, national and local levels. The following 
section assesses the state of global responses to date and 
highlights gaps and barriers that have hindered the collective 
ability to manage environmental change. Proposals are then made 
for results-based responses anchored in the many different centres 
of governance for addressing global environmental challenges and 
advancing human well-being. 

STATE OF GLOBAL RESPONSES 
Over the past 40 years a wide range of responses to 
environmental problems has been implemented as a set of 
interacting systems with multiple actors at different scales. 
Conventional responses at national and global levels include 
the creation of rules, laws and institutions, with international 
organizations established to serve as conveners at the global 
scale; as arbiters for exchange, sharing experiences, articulating 
interests and aggregating preferences; as sources of expertise; 
and as enablers of a broader social dialogue (Bearce and 
Bondanella 2007; Esty and Ivanova 2002; Bartlett et al. 1995). 
The public sector accounts for about 30 per cent of gross 
domestic product (GDP) worldwide (World Bank 2011) and is an 
essential tool in creating enabling conditions for societal change, 
with public-private partnerships and social networks bringing 
new opportunities for engagement. Notwithstanding all the good 
intentions and efforts, however, the Earth and its sub-systems 
are showing signs of considerable degradation. 

The global response framework: from isolation to 
integration 
Currently, environmental problems are rarely tackled in an 
integrated fashion. The connectedness of climate change, 
water resources, desertification and biodiversity loss, for 
example, makes isolated governance responses inadequate and 
potentially counterproductive. A more integrated approach to 
substantive issues and spatial scale demands a new adaptive 
governance framework. 

Global environmental issues can be divided into those that are 
common to many or most countries, including pollution of water 
bodies or solid waste disposal, and those that affect the global 
commons such as pollution of the global atmosphere or the 

open seas. Not all environmental issues require a global scale 
of governance. Some can be addressed through cooperation 
between a few countries, for example the transboundary 
water concerns of the Mekong or Zambezi rivers or networks 
of protected areas for endangered marine species with limited 
ranges. However, problems of the global commons – ones 
that cumulatively lead to negative global trends and/or whose 
drivers are essentially global – often require international 
treaties to ensure collective global action. Relationships between 
international and national scales of governance tend to be 
structured as: 
•	 bottom-up:	countries	harmonize	national	policy,	with	the	

policy space created determining the ability to accommodate 
international commitments;

•	 top-down:	thresholds,	targets	and	principles	are	decided	

at global level and then translated into national-scale 
implementation; 

•	 multi-level:	policy	development	that	addresses	the	complex	
relationships between the different levels of governance and 
the actors involved.

Governments have used international institutions as key 
instruments when global action is required. Cooperative 
behaviour is enhanced by changing the environment within 
which collective agreements arise, increasing awareness 
about particular issues, and enhancing national capacity to 
deal with the problems in question (Haas et al. 1993). In the 
environmental field, international institutions have channelled 
information, created norms and principles, provided training 
and financial resources to affected countries, and catalysed 
actions at multiple levels of governance (Young 2010, 2002). 
The UN General Assembly formally initiated the international 
environmental agenda through Resolution 2398 (XXIII) on 
3 December 1968, calling for the convening of the United Nations 
Conference on the Human Environment, the 1972 Stockholm 
Conference. The assembly framed the environmental challenge as 
an integral part of economic and social development, with UNEP 
established as the institutional mechanism to ensure follow-up 
to the environmental dimension of the conference outcome. The 
promotion and coordination of environmental activities within 
the whole UN system was one of the core functions governments 
delegated to UNEP. With environmental awareness on the rise, 
the new programme also initiated a number of new international 
agreements aiming to address emerging environmental issues. 

Environmental activities have become an integral component 
of the UN system, represented by its programmes, agencies, 
secretariats and coordinating mechanisms. Table 17.1 identifies 
core instruments anchored within the UN system’s multi-sectoral 
environmental response regime as they relate to the environmental 
issues assessed in Part 1 of GEO-5. The many instruments at the 
regional level, such as international agreements on transboundary 
waters, are not included. Nonetheless, the table illustrates that the 
competence and capacities of the environmental institutions in the 
UN system are distributed among its different entities and policy 
sectors, reflecting the growing importance of various governing 
bodies across the system.

While the level of environmental integration both within and 
outside the UN system is significant – representing an important 
source of competence and capacity – the integrated governance 
of the diverse and multi-sectoral environmental field is complex 
and, at times, problematic (Oberthür and Stokke 2011), 
especially for sustainability goals. 

At times it seems that calls to simplify are at odds with a need 
to capture system complexity: on one hand, governments have 
requested that the United Nations foster synergies between 
compatible multilateral environmental agreements and identify 
guiding elements for realizing such synergies while respecting 
the autonomy of the conferences of the parties (UNEP 2011e). 
There have been several attempts to integrate these diverse 
efforts, including clustering the chemical conventions by 
convening simultaneous Extraordinary Conferences of the 
Parties to the Basel, Rotterdam and Stockholm Conventions 
in February 2010 in Bali, Indonesia. There is also coordination 
between the three Rio conventions – on climate, biodiversity, 
and desertification – under the Joint Liaison Group and the 44 
UN entities of the Environment Management Group, the UN-wide 
coordination body for the environment (UNEP 2011f). 

On the other hand, interrelationships and interdependencies 
exist between all levels of governance and intervention – from the 
individual and community scale to the global level. Multiple causal 
mechanisms are at work, including normative influences, prices 
and markets, political pressure and incentives, persuasion, social 
learning and the science-policy interface (Simmons et al. 2006). 
Each may operate in isolation or with others, build pressures over 
time and in combination. Multi-scale interventions can be both 
counterproductive and mutually enforcing. In such interventions, 
countries can adopt policies that they then encourage others 
to adopt as international norms and/or law, yet those policies 
may influence others adversely. Once in place, the norms and 
economic incentives may affect behaviour more broadly. They 
may also engender future changes to legal regimes, normative 
signals, social learning and resource transfers. In addition, diverse 
actors including members of civil society organizations, scientific 
networks and research institutions, international organizations, 
faith communities and the private sector are engaged not only 
in demanding but also in providing global responses (Slaughter

Czempiel 1991; Keohane and Nye 1971).

Legal and policy framework
As Part 1 of this report illustrates, it is difficult to measure 
success in achieving environmental goals, especially if those 
goals are not quantified. Environmental treaties form the core 
legal and policy framework for the global environment and aim 
to set appropriate goals for the international community. While 
environmental laws are legally binding, the lack of specific 
targets and timetables often implies that these are, in effect, 
soft law guidelines rather than hard law frameworks. Some 
treaties are also difficult to implement because of the lack of 
capacity in individual countries. In addition, verifying change in 
environmental quality and attributing changes to specific policy 
measures is challenging without robust and comparable data, 
especially at the global level.

Environmental treaties
Today, there are more than 500 international treaties and other 
agreements that relate to the environment, of which 323 are 
regional and 302 date from 1972 and the early 2000s. The 
core of the global environmental legal framework, however, 
is made up of a more limited number of treaties with a 
growing number of ratifications (Figure 17.1). Most of the new 
agreements have established new, independent bureaucracies 
and this proliferation has fragmented authority in international 
environmental governance. Thus, while the creation of the 
various environmental conventions and protocols can be  
viewed as an achievement, it also raises the need for continuing 
support in developing countries when national administrations 
become overloaded with reporting requirements and countless 
international meetings (Najam 2005; Biermann 2004). 

A distinguishing feature of the more effective treaties is their 
development through the interplay of organized scientific 
communities (Haas and Stevens 2011) and a moderate to strong 
international institution (Biermann and Siebenhüner 2009; 
Haas 2007). The scientific community informs treaties that 
reflect an understanding of the problems and their solutions, 
while the institutions integrate the science into draft treaties, 
help promote the ideas of the scientists, coordinate meetings, 
compile information repositories, provide incentives to states 
to participate in negotiations and assist member states in 
complying with their obligations. Innovation in technology, 
networking, coordination and knowledge management can help 
this process. Chapter 16 has also pointed to the critical role 

of planning in creating the conditions suitable to coordinate 
integrated, complex or multi-procedural outcomes.

The Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the 
Ozone Layer is one example of such a success. Under this, 
countries have almost totally eliminated the production of 
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) in just 20 years. The protocol’s 
success resulted from:
•	 scientific	consensus	on	the	problem;
•	 public	awareness	and	pressure;
•	 existence	of	a	cost-effective	substitute;
•	 private	sector	buy-in;
•	 leadership	from	both	an	international	institution,	UNEP,	and	a	

national agency, the US Environmental Protection Agency;

•	 a	concrete	plan	of	action;	and
•	 mobilization	of	financial	resources	in	developed	countries	to	

assist developing countries and economies in transition.

Unfortunately, one of the replacement chemicals, 
hydrofluorocarbons, has a high global warming potential and 
now needs to be phased out to address climate change – 
illustrating the interconnectivity of environmental problems. 
Similarly, cold temperatures in the upper atmosphere, possibly 
due to climate change, are resulting in increased loss of ozone, 
particularly over the Arctic.

Part 3: Global Responses

Box 17.1 Diffusion of policy tools worldwide – the case of strategic environmental assessment

One widely used policy tool across all regions is strategic 
environmental assessment, which helps to integrate national 
environmental policies. This goes beyond environmental 
impact assessments to ensure that environmental, social 
and economic information is incorporated into decision 
making in a unified manner. The process involves analysing 
the likely impacts of decisions; fostering public participation; 
developing and comparing alternatives fostering; recording 
the impact, options and comments from the public in a report; 
ensuring that the report is taken into account when making 
final decisions; and informing the public about the decisions. 

Strategic environmental assessments were initially 
implemented in Europe, but have since spread to many 

countries, increasingly becoming an obligatory part of 
national legislation (OECD 2012). Experiences in Africa, for 
example, show that this type of assessment has to go beyond 
the project level and be carried out on the level of policy 
plans to become effective. In Guinea, it has been used to 
develop the co-management of reserved forests; in Zambia 
and Zimbabwe, the International Union for the Conservation 
of Nature (IUCN) supported its use for planning developments 
around Victoria Falls – a World Heritage site; Morocco used it 
to provide an analysis of legal, regulatory, and institutional 
aspects of environmental impacts in the large-scale irrigation 
sector (Economic Commission of Africa 2005); while in 
Ghana it has improved the management of mangrove forests 
(Sampong 2004). 

outcomes, developing and implementing a system-wide  
capacity-building framework is crucial (OECD 2011b). Studies 
from international organizations (Baser and Morgan 2008), 
academics (Eyben 2006), non-governmental organizations 
(Lipson and Warren 2006) and other practitioners (James  
and Wrigley 2007) suggest that capacity building: 
•	 is	a	complex	human	process	based	on	values,	emotions	and	

beliefs; 

•	 involves	the	main	actors	taking	responsibility	for	the	process	

of change; 

•	 involves	shifts	in	power	and	identity;	
•	 involves	changes	in	relationships	between	elements	of	

human systems; 

•	 is	uncertain	and	unpredictable	in	its	outcomes;	and	
•	 is	strongly	shaped	by	culture	and	values	(Woodhill	2010).	

This implies greater consideration and recognition of the less 
visible aspects of capacity building, such as values, legitimacy, 
identity and self-confidence, as well as other non-monetary 
forms of motivation (Aragón and Macedo 2010). It also involves 
improving access to key resources such as finance, technology 
and knowledge that underpin capacity and capabilities. 
Capacity building can also be advanced by building on lessons 
learned from a diffusion of policy tools. Strategic environmental 
assessments are an example of diffusion of policy instruments 
where timing, public participation and credibility of policy 
analysis stand out as important determinants of success 
(Runhaar and Driesen 2007).

Financial flows 
Expanding the donor base, increasing the availability and 
accessibility of funds, and ensuring stable and predictable 
financial flows are among the top priorities in international 
environmental governance (UNEP 2010). The first financing 
mechanism designed explicitly and exclusively for global 
environmental purposes was the Environment Fund. Created 
in 1972 through UN General Assembly Resolution 2997 as one 

of the core elements of the new environment programme, the 
Environment Fund was intended to finance new environmental 
initiatives within the UN system and to assist developing 
countries. Today, environmental financing comes in the form 
of environmental aid from bilateral and multilateral donors, 
including through funds dedicated to specific environmental 
concerns such as the Montreal Fund for the Implementation of 
the Montreal Protocol to support ozone-related work, climate 
funds to support mitigation and adaptation, funds to combat 
deforestation, and others. The Global Environment Facility (GEF) 
is the largest funder of projects that specifically seek to improve 
the global environment through support for the additional costs 
of transforming projects with national benefits into projects with 
global environmental benefits.

Box 17.2 Identifying financial flows for environmental response

It is currently difficult to get a complete picture of the amount 
of resources invested in environmental activities at normative 
and operational levels. Financial resources are often counted 
several times as funding flows from one organization to 
another or between funding categories. This double counting 
is also due to lack of distinct definitions and the inherent 
overlaps between categories of spending. Reported financial 
figures are often not fully comparable because the financial 
year and budget procedures vary among institutions. 
Furthermore, since much of the investment in environmental 
activities happens through integrating environmental 
perspectives and issues into policies, programmes and 
projects, it is often difficult to distinguish environmental 
activities from sectoral ones. For example, as much as 85 per 
cent of the World Bank’s environmental and natural resource 
management (ENRM) projects are currently being managed by 
non-environmental sectors in the bank (UNEP 2011c). Several 
important developments illustrate annual financial flows for 
responses to environmental challenges.
•	 The	carbon	market	stalled	in	2010	at	US$142	billion	after	
rapid growth, partly because of lack of regulatory clarity. The 
figure includes the value of the primary and secondary Clean 
Development Mechanism (CDM) markets, which respectively 
stood at US$1.5 billion and US$18.3 billion (World Bank 2011).

•	 Countries	of	the	Organisation	for	Economic	Co-operation	
and Development (OECD) allocated the following official 
development assistance (ODA): 
–  up to US$22.9 billion, 15 per cent of total ODA, to 
climate change mitigation and adaptation in 2010 
(OECD 2011c);

–  US$4.3 billion to biodiversity in 2009 (OECD 2011a);
–  US$1.9 billion to desertification in 2009 (OECD 2011a).

•	 UNEP	(2011c)	reports	the	following	indicative	levels	of	

financial environmental flows:
–  annual pledges to the GEF for the fifth replenishment 

agreed in 2010 amount to US$1.1 billion;

–  the World Bank’s environmental and natural resource 
management (ENRM) portfolio, including the GEF, in 
2008 reached US$3 billion;

–  the United Nations Development Programme’s (UNDP) 
expenditures on environmental activities, including the 
GEF, in 2009 were US$1.1 billion;

–  UNEPs budget for 2010 was US$0.5 billion including 

the GEF, the Environment Fund and the Multilateral 
Fund for the implementation of the Montreal Protocol;

–  the combined annual budget for the three Rio 

conventions in the period 2008–2011 was of the order 
of US$0.1 billion.

Yet, long-standing commitments from developed countries 
to improve access to finance for developing countries remain 
largely unfulfilled, and insufficient and unpredictable financial 
resources continue to constrain effective environmental 
governance at all levels (OECD 2011b). It is currently difficult 
to identify the financial flows for environmental responses 
(Box 17.2) as there is no tracking system to monitor resources 
invested in environmental activities by the United Nations and 
other international institutions (UNEP 2011e). A review of the 
existing data shows that while there are significant financial 
investments in climate change and other environmental 
initiatives, they fall well short of the scale required to address 
the challenges (Behrens 2009; Müller 2009; UNDP 2007). For 
example, the World Bank estimates that the price tag between 
2010 and 2050 for adapting to an approximately 2oC warmer 
world by 2050 will be in the range of US$70 billion to US$100 
billion a year (World Bank 2010a).

The Environment Fund 
The Environment Fund is the principal source of financing for 
the implementation of UNEP’s programme, and was established 
by the UN General Assembly in 1972. Altogether, 181 countries 
have made at least one voluntary contribution in the period 
between 1973 and 2011, with 12 countries having maintained 
their regular annual contributions over the whole period (UNEP 
2012). The four-decade trend depicted in Figure 17.2, however, 
shows that the original intention to grow the fund proportionally

with intensifying environmental problems has not been truly 
realized. While it shows some growth in current terms, in real 
terms (adjusted for inflation), the fund fell by 44 per cent 
between 1977 and 1987 and is only now reaching the 
US$160 million per biennium that UNEP attracted in the 
1970s and again in the run-up to the 1992 Rio Earth Summit 
(Ivanova 2011).

Multilateral environmental agreements
As discussed, governments created multilateral environmental 
agreements when new environmental issues emerged. Table 
17.2 offers an overview of financial flows for the secretariats 
of MEAs by cluster – the GEF provides funding for project-level 
work in these clusters.

The Multilateral Fund for the Implementation of the Montreal 
Protocol
Funding for implementation of most multilateral environmental 
agreements comes through special funds, the largest of 
which is the Multilateral Fund for the Implementation of the 
Montreal Protocol. Created in 1990 and administered by 
UNEP, it helps developing countries comply with the protocol’s 

control measures. It has been replenished eight times since 
the beginning of its operation in 1991, with contributions from 
the industrialized countries, including countries in transition, 
assessed according to the UN scale of assessment. The 
significant financial resources devoted to the ozone treaty – 
during 1991–2011 governments pledged US$2.8 billion to 
the Montreal Protocol (UNEP 2011f) – can be seen both as 
a reason for and an indicator of the treaty’s effectiveness in 
eliminating the production and consumption of most CFCs. 
Significant initial investment was critical to the fund’s success, 
and this initial success stimulated sustained investment in  
the longer-term. 

The Global Environment Facility
Established as a US$1 billion pilot programme in the World 
Bank in 1992, the GEF has evolved to become the financial 
mechanism for several multilateral environmental agreements, 
including UNFCCC, the Convention on Biodiversity (CBD), the 
United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) 
and the Stockholm Convention. Over the past 20 years, the 
GEF has allocated US$10 billion for more than 2 800 projects 
in more than 168 developing countries and economies in

UNEP, today it is in partnership with ten UN agencies, 182 civil

society organizations and the private sector. This diversity 
of participation is directly related to the GEF’s co-financing 
requirement, through which it has leveraged more than  
US$47 billion of funds additional to those available through 
UN and World Bank channels since 1992. The GEF’s operational 
arrangements have also evolved, with a new system for the 
transparent allocation of resources (STAR) implemented in 
2010. That same year, donors pledged more than US$4.3 
billion in replenishment for the period 2010–2014 (GEF-5), 
representing a 55 per cent increase in resources over GEF-4  
(GEF 2010). During 1991–2010, the GEF invested more than 
US$50 billion, US$40.7 billion of which came from co-financing 
from development partners – almost half of these funds  
were used for climate change mitigation and adaptation 
(Figure 17.3). In 2010 alone, the GEF disbursed a little over 
US$5 billion for its work; 81 per cent of this amount was  
from co-financing (GEF 2010).

Environmental official development assistance 
Close to US$100 billion of aid, an average of 15 per cent of 
the global total, was committed to the environment in 1998–
2007 (Castro and Hammond 2009), with the most significant 
source of environmental financing being official development 
assistance (ODA) from the OECD countries. OECD countries’ 
aid commitments targeted at the objectives of the three Rio 
conventions combined grew from US$5.1 billion in 1999 to 
US$17.4 billion in 2009 (Figure 17.4), largely because of 
increases in funds targeted at climate change. The challenges 
of proliferation of institutional mechanisms, however, are  
acute in the environmental field. 

Box 17.3 International aid for the environment

Environmental aid is no different from aid to other sectors: 
there are too many actors, adding to the administrative 
burden on countries and donors, and impeding aid 
effectiveness. The average partner country has 17 donors 
out of the 23 members and 10 major multilateral agencies 
that report to the OECD’s Development Assistance Committee 
(DAC). Adding up the number of donors in each country for 
the 153 countries that receive ODA shows that there are 
2 617 donor/recipient partnerships, all of which need to be 
maintained through policy dialogue, planning, coordination, 
accounting and reporting. In 1 571 of these partnerships –  
60 per cent – donors are providing environment aid.

The individual size of the projects and programmes that 
constitute these partnerships varies enormously. At one 
extreme, four donors annually provide over US$10 million 
of core environmental aid on average per partner, while at 
the other extreme there are 11 donors whose average aid 
per partner is less than US$1 million. Moreover, the number 
of small partnerships has increased faster in the past 
decade than the larger ones. This plethora of partnerships 

is just a glimpse of the complexity of the architecture of 
environmental aid. Each donor operates through an average 
of three agencies using literally thousands of channels. There 
are also 30 or more bilateral donors that are not members of 
the DAC, and dozens of small multilateral agencies operating 
environmental aid programmes.

Official development finance for the environment is 
big business, with thousands of actors and annual  
commitments exceeding US$15 billion. But, in common 
with the health sector, the number of actors and channels 
needs to be rationalized through a better division of labour. 
Otherwise, as aid to the environment is scaled up in 
response to the challenges of climate change, there is a 
danger that developing countries will be further overburdened 
with a plethora of competing actors, funds and initiatives,  
which will undermine the effectiveness of the aid 
being provided and limit developmental and 
environmental results.

Stakeholder engagement: from consultation to 
participation
Traditionally reserved for governments, the global arena is 
now open to a broader range of civil society actors, including 
non-governmental organizations, businesses, faith groups and 
academic institutions (Willetts 2011; Gemmill and Bamidele-
Izu 2002). Over the years, the role of stakeholders in global 
governance has shifted from simply being consulted in the 
1960s, to serving as back-stage managers in the 1970s, to 
being protected and empowered in the 1980s, to being invited 
as partners in the 1990s, to the present state as practitioners 
carrying out initiatives on the ground. This transition has been 
described as one of increasing engagement and empowerment 
(Gupta 2003). Stakeholders have had significant impact, from 
their role in requesting advisory opinions from the International 
Court of Justice on the legality of nuclear weapons (Yamin 2001), 
to involvement in environmental litigation (Beyerlin 2001). In 
global water governance, non-state actors have even taken the 
lead, filling an institutional void and responding to an emerging 
need for a global response to water problems (Varady and Iles-
Shih 2009; Pahl-Wostl et al. 2008). 

National and global responses to environmental challenges 
require effective engagement of multiple stakeholders – at 
different levels of governance – in the collective definition, 
adoption and implementation of solutions (Parts 1 and 2). At 
the global level, collaboration between actors comes into play 

at different stages of policy intervention, including agenda 
setting and framing; rule-making; enforcement; and assessing 
resilience (Underdal 1998; Haas 2000). By participating in 
global governance, civil society groups have the opportunity to 
communicate concerns from local stakeholders to international 
organizations. Additionally, civil society groups facilitate 
informed public debate by collecting and disseminating 
information about, and critical evaluations of, international 
governance (Steffek and Nanz 2008).

Participatory approaches can be transformational (Hickey and 
Mohan 2005; Chambers 1997; Mohan 2002) or instrumental 
(Neef 2008; Hooper 2005; Mohan 2002; Mayo and Craig 1995). 
In the information age, decision makers possess a plethora 
of new means to engage stakeholders. Social networks, for 
example, can be valuable if unpredictable assets for engaging 
citizens in active, emergent and functional communities of 
practice. Crowdsourcing, the act of sourcing tasks normally 
performed by individuals by issuing an open call, is increasingly 
used to encourage community-based design and democratic 
participation. Iceland recently crowd-sourced a wiki/open-
source version of its constitution and the result was a proposal 
for several changes with broad public support (Constitutional 
Council of Iceland 2011). In fact, non-governmental organizations 
have been critical to the development and existence of an open, 
publicly accessible internet conducive to democratic global 
engagement (Willetts 2011).

OPTIONS FOR GLOBAL RESPONSES 
Effective responses to global environmental problems require a 
management framework that embodies a holistic and adaptive 
approach at all levels. Such a framework would include clear and 
measurable goals, verifiable strategies, and sound monitoring 
and evaluation mechanisms to address the root causes of 
emerging environmental problems, reducing environmental and 
social vulnerability, and accommodating multiple perspectives 
and solutions. At each stage, a multi-stakeholder interactive and 
iterative process would take place. This approach would facilitate 
the adoption of more realistic plans that can be continuously 
monitored, as well as promoting ownership and accountability 
(FAO 2010; UNDG 2010). Against this backdrop, this section 
assesses the rationale for the following six linked and mutually 
reinforcing response options:
•	 framing	environmental	goals	in	the	context	of	sustainable	

development;

•	 enhancing	the	effectiveness	of	global	institutions;
•	 investing	in	enhanced	capacities	for	addressing	

environmental change;

•	 supporting	technological	innovation	and	development;
•	 strengthening	rights-based	approaches	and	access	to	

environmental justice; and

•	 deepening	and	broadening	stakeholder	engagement.

Framing environmental goals in the context of sustainable 
development
Findings from GEO-5 reinforce the importance of setting 
measurable goals and targets to effectively monitor progress 
and advance the sustainability agenda. Goal-setting arenas 
at the international level include not only public institutions 
such as the UN system but also civil society groups and private-
sector associations, among others. Global goals need to be 
complemented by synergized regional, national and local goals, 
as well as concrete national action plans. 

The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) represent a results-
based approach to advancing human well-being by setting and 
monitoring global development outcomes. Lessons should be 
learnt from the MDGs to implement a results-based framework 
with global goals for sustainable development, including the 
environment, and provide clear metrics for measuring and tracking 
progress. The MDG addressing environmental sustainability, 
MDG 7, for example, has proven challenging to implement 
in most countries, not least because of a lack of measurable 
indicators (World Bank 2005). The MDG 7 target of integrating the 
principles of sustainable development into country policies and 
programmes, and reversing the loss of environmental resources, 
is the only non-quantitative target in the MDG framework. As a 
result, according to the OECD (2008), MDG 7 “often gets pushed 
aside in the programmes of bilateral donors and international 
financing institutions”. 

A more balanced set of goals for sustainable development could 
more effectively help address the risks that environmental 
change may pose to development. This can be illustrated by 
the scenario analysis from the Human Development Report 

2011 (UNDP 2011), which shows that countries with a very high 
Human Development Index (HDI) score are projected to be less 
affected by environmental risks than those in all other categories 
(Figure 17.5), and demonstrates the need for a set of goals for 
sustainable development that promotes a balanced integration 
of its environmental, social and economic dimensions.

Effective monitoring of environmental outcomes requires 
establishing quantifiable metrics or conditional states that can 
be measured, such as the nitrate concentration in a body of water 
or the number of species inhabiting a specific area (Jordan et 
al. 2010). Methodological techniques – such as gap analysis, 
distance-to-target comparative analysis and benchmarking – can 
provide valuable insights into how countries perform relative to 
each other. Common indicators can facilitate knowledge transfer as 
they help governments at all levels to identify and share successful 
implementation strategies (Strange and Bayley 2008). The MEAs 
have been developing global goals that focus on articulating the 
desired state of the environment, reducing pressures and creating 
joint measures, together with technical assistance and capacity 
building to scale up implementation. Increasingly, these goals 
have been specified so that results can be identified through 
quantifiable metrics or conditional states that can be measured.

human systems in the environmental disaster scenario are put under 
severe stress by, for example, the overuse of fossil fuels and falling 
water tables, glacial melting, progressive deforestation and land 
degradation, dramatic declines in biodiversity, greater frequency of 
extreme weather and increased civil conﬂict.

Part 3: Global Responses

Without clear metrics for measuring progress towards 
sustainable development, achieving internationally agreed 
goals will remain elusive. In bringing sustainability to the core 
of decision making, rethinking the way economic development 
and human well-being are currently measured and monitored 
becomes crucial (Pintér et al. 2011; Stiglitz et al. 2009). This 
requires a broader set of indicators for measuring economic, 
social and environmental dimensions of sustainable 
development that go beyond GDP, currently the most widely 
used indicator of economic development. This has long been 
called for, and measurement reform has recently received 
greater attention in political agendas, as illustrated by such 
efforts as the on-going review and revision of the framework 
for environmental accounts led by the UN Statistics Division 
(United Nations 2011), the adjusted net national savings 
methods of the World Bank (World Bank 2010b), the European 
Commission’s Beyond GDP programme (Stiglitz et al. 2009),  
the OECD’s Measuring the Progress of Societies initiative 
(Hall et al. 2010) and UNEP’s Green Economy Initiative 
(UNEP 2011d). These have resulted in the development of 
environmental and social indicators and aggregate indices 
to complement GDP and traditional national accounts that are 
now beginning to be applied. 

Governments, academia, civil society and the private sector 
could collaborate in the development of environmental goals for 
the global, regional and national levels within the sustainable 
development framework. Examples of such collaborations 
include internationally agreed goals to:
•	 stabilize	greenhouse	gas	concentrations	in	the	atmosphere	
at a level that would keep the increase in global temperature 
below 2oC relative to pre-industrial levels, and enhance long-
term cooperative action to combat climate change on the 
basis of equity (UNFCCC 2010);

•	 halt	the	loss	of	biodiversity	in	order	to	ensure	that	

ecosystems are resilient and continue to provide essential 
services, thereby securing the planet’s variety of life and 
contributing to human well-being and poverty eradication 
(CBD 2010);

•	 reverse	and	prevent	desertification	and	land	degradation	and	

mitigate the effects of drought in affected areas in order to 
support poverty reduction and environmental sustainability 
(UNCCD 2008).

Any internationally agreed sustainable development goals would 
need to be customized and translated into national targets in 
order to facilitate measurement of progress towards meeting 
those targets and facilitate support for their implementation. 
The development and implementation of internationally agreed 
indicators could then be coupled with piloting, capacity building 
in statistical offices, and collaboration with the private sector, 
research institutions and non-governmental organizations. The 
data collected and utilized through the monitoring of indicators 
could be maintained and shared through collaborative databases 
open to the public. Such goal-setting processes could draw on 
regional experiences and be informed by and draw inspiration 
from various schemes that address Earth System challenges, 
such as the Earth Charter Initiative (2011) and the Stockholm 
Memorandum: Tipping the Scales Towards Sustainability 
(Nobel Laureate Symposium 2011). Furthermore, incentive and 
accountability mechanisms would need to be put in place for 
monitoring the progress towards achieving goals, acknowledging 
and supporting successes and thereby facilitating progress. 

Enhancing the effectiveness of global institutions 
Successful global responses to environmental challenges 
require accurate data and rigorous analysis, agreement on any 
course of action, and effective execution and implementation of 
agreed strategies at all levels. The science-policy interface has 
been strengthened in recent years, particularly in the field of 
indicators, assessments and early warning systems, supported 
by developments in research, modelling, monitoring and 
observations, and especially by advances in information and 
communication technologies. Significant attention has been 
given to the design and governance structure of these processes 
to ensure their scientific independence and credibility as well 
as their legitimacy and relevance to the full and meaningful 
participation of developing countries (UNEP 2011e). The interface 

Box 17.4 Response option 1: Framing environmental goals in the context of sustainable development and 
monitoring outcomes

Establish a sustainable development goals framework that 
integrates the contribution of the environment to development 
and poverty reduction. A process could be initiated to revisit 
and extend the MDGs in the form of Sustainable Development 
Goals (SDGs) with clear, measurable indicators, keeping in 
mind the need for a coherent and balanced integration of the 
environmental, economic and social pillars of sustainability. 

These goals could serve as a common reference point for 
action and accountability for a wide range of actors, including 
intergovernmental institutions, the private sector, civil society 

and individuals. The framework could articulate a vision for 
enhancing human well-being – as it relates to health, material 
needs, social relations and security – in an inter- and intra-
generational, equitable manner. 

Such a framework could be complemented by targets and 
measurable indicators building on initiatives that go beyond 
GDP. Placed within such a framework, a sub-set of global 
environmental goals could draw on an assessment of existing 
international environmental agreements and instruments, 
including the three Rio conventions – UNFCCC, CBD and UNCCD.

could be further strengthened by addressing inequalities in 
scientific capacity through scaling up support for science-policy 
capacity in developing countries. Additional efforts could include 
strengthening data-gathering systems, cooperation on enhancing 
the connectivity and efficiency of existing international 
environmental assessments, scientific panels and information 
networks, and targeting the communication of scientific findings 
to various audiences. Technology can enable resource users to 
make better decisions and can give decision makers access to 
better and timelier information about environmental conditions, 
helping them organize effective responses. The diffusion of 
global positioning systems (GPS), mobile telephones and 
other decentralized technologies, including social media, can 
strengthen citizen engagement and involvement, which can help 
create a more robust foundation for coherent decision making. 
This sort of dynamic approach would strengthen institutions by 
adding wider society into the science-policy interface – further 
broadening the depth of stakeholder engagement and integrating 
the concept of human well-being into action and implementation.
 
Agreement on a global course of action requires effective 
coordination, which is especially difficult at the global level. 
Within the United Nations, the environment falls within the 
portfolio of organizations with thematic and functional focuses 
directly related to the environment, and of other institutions 
that have integrated the environment as a priority area (UNEP 
2011c). Consultations on how to strengthen international 
environmental governance have been active since 2006, when 
the UN General Assembly agreed to explore the possibility of a 
more coherent institutional framework to address environmental 

activities efficiently. The negotiations, including consultations 
under UNEP’s Governing Council, revealed that regularized 
processes for developing, implementing, assessing and revising 
a UN system-wide environmental strategy and the division of 
labour are necessary. A new strategy, developed through an 
inclusive process involving governments and seeking input 
from civil society, including the private sector, could facilitate 
inter-agency cooperation and clarify the division of labour within 
the UN system (UNEP 2011e). A recent review of the evolution of 
environmental activities in the United Nations has demonstrated 
that there are substantive environmental resources and 
capacities within the system (UNEP 2011f), which could be 
mobilized and better utilized through a regularized process of 
developing, implementing and revising an overarching strategy.

While the system for global environmental governance has 
grown rapidly, there has been no systematic assessment of the 
performance of international organizations in relation to their 
mandates or to their impact on environmental quality. The absence 
of a scientifically credible and politically legitimate assessment 
of the institutional aspects and options for strengthening 
international environmental governance could be a reason why it 
has proved difficult for countries to agree on a way forward. The 
United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development in 2012 
(Rio+20) is an opportunity to initiate an assessment of institutional 
performance and a strategic analysis of options for strengthening 
international environmental governance. The process could follow 
the procedures of the GEO process and take the form of a special 
GEO report that builds on and deepens the analysis of the global 
response. The intergovernmental aspects of the process could

Part 3: Global Responses

Box 17.5 Response option 2: Enhancing the effectiveness of global institutions

Elevate and mainstream the sustainable development 
agenda into the core of decision making within the UN 
system, supported by enhanced cooperation with and 
between environmental, economic and social institutions. 
Cooperation between key institutions could be strengthened, 
including by building on and further enhancing the work of 
the Chief Executives Board on Coordination (CEB) and the 
Environmental Management Group (EMG) as currently guided 
by the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) and the UNEP 
Governing Council respectively.

Within the institutional framework of sustainable 
development:
•	 convene	a	science-policy	interface	forum	with	

representatives from existing environmental assessments, 
scientific panels and information networks to advance 
their connectivity and efficiency, facilitate ways of meeting 
the science-policy capacity needs of developing countries, 
strengthen data gathering and target the communication of 
scientific findings to various audiences;

•  launch a consultative process for the development of 
a system-wide strategy for the environment in the UN 

system, built around those environmental goals that 
already have international agreement. The UNEP Governing 
Council, the principle subsidiary body of the General 
Assembly on environmental matters, could set up a 
process by tasking the EMG as the principle inter-agency 
environment body to draft the strategy and then devise a 
process for review by and consultation with the governing 
bodies of members of the EMG and other inter-agency 
bodies and stakeholders;

•	 initiate	a	strategic	review	of	entities	in	the	international	
environmental system that compares actual performance 
to expected results, identifies key constraints and 
opportunities and outlines ways to measure impact. An 
independent review would help clarify the environmental 
mandates of existing organizations, elaborate a 
substantive vision for global environmental governance 
and outline ways to address priority issues. It would also 
collate reports on the status of reform efforts, set short- 
and long-term goals, and establish timeframes to complete 
reforms. It could provide a replicable template for similar 
assessments of other global public goods and help build a 
foundation for continued United Nations reforms. 

be ensured through an initial and concluding intergovernmental 
consultation and government peer review. Scientific credibility 
could be ensured by appointing leading scientific experts both 
from within and beyond the UN system, and through extensive 
scientific and system-wide peer review.

Investing in enhanced capacities for addressing environmental 
change
Enhancing capacity requires multi-dimensional and systemic 
approaches. The capacity of individuals, institutions and 
organizations as well as societies and communities to implement 
effective policies is tied to a complex set of tangible and 
intangible attitudes, resources, strategies and skills (Aragón 
and Macedo 2010). Part 2 of GEO-5 highlights the inadequacy 
of purely technical assistance and emphasizes the importance 
of governance systems, knowledge systems, technology and 
shared value systems in reducing vulnerability and strengthening 
resilience to environmental change. Limited capacity for 
designing, implementing and reviewing the effectiveness 
of policies can be a significant barrier to successful policy 
replication, scaling and learning, especially in developing 
countries. More focused policies are needed on the less visible 
aspects of capacity enhancement, such as values, legitimacy, 
identity and self-confidence, as well as other non-monetary forms 
of motivation (Aragón and Macedo 2010). 

Effective environmental governance is made more challenging 
by the range of sectoral agencies whose decisions can have an 
environmental impact. Organizational design at the international 

and national level rests on the functional division of authority 
into isolated decision-making units. While governments and the 
international system have, since the 1972 Stockholm Conference, 
striven to remedy gaps in information flow and authority, 
environment ministries remain relatively weak within national 
governments and within the international system. Economic 
ministries have maintained their influence, and thus efforts to 
develop policies to internalize the ecological externalities of 
economic development have continued to be weak.

Numerous countries and international organizations have 
experimented with institutional designs to improve the flow of 
information between functional authorities. For instance, France, 
Spain and the United States created coordinative environmental 
councils to work with other government agencies to complement 
the regulatory authority of environment ministries. At the 
international level, the United Nations has tried to encourage 
inter-agency cooperation and to internalize environmental 
considerations into the policies of other functional agencies 
(Haas and Haas 1995; Ivanova and Roy 2007).

Policy experience and best practice at a range of scales can 
also provide lessons for policy development and strengthening 
capacities. Part 2 of GEO-5 offers several examples of relatively 
successful regional policy design and implementation, such as 
the Maldives adopting a goal of carbon neutrality by 2020, and 
the European Union Industrial Emissions Directive that resulted 
in significant reductions in sulphur dioxide emissions across 
Europe. In addition to these, the use of strategic environmental

assessment has generated examples of how environmental 
goals can be integrated into and addressed through national 
development policy (Box 17.1).

Another key capacity challenge lies in the dearth of financial 
resources. Insufficient predictability and availability of funds has 
been a key constraint on effective environmental governance 
at all levels. Yet, global foreign direct investment flows in 2010 
were US$1.2 trillion (UNCTAD 2010), far exceeding the value of 
development funding from international organizations or ODA-
related flows. Innovative financial instruments that leverage 
private investments and improve environmental performance 
could help bridge the finance gap (Girishankar 2009) – through, 
for example, linking financing to environmental outcomes 
(World Bank 2010c). Such instruments include debt-for-nature 
swaps, payment for ecosystem services, emissions trading 
and carbon finance, as well as tools from development finance 
such as green bonds, microcredit, insurance and other risk 
management instruments, and performance derivatives (Sander 
and Cranford 2010). More recent ideas include advanced 
market commitments that guarantee revenues to companies 
for a limited time to stimulate markets, and prize funds for 
environmentally sound technologies. 

At the national level, targeted policies and instruments are 
needed to facilitate large-scale green investments, generate 
necessary resources for public expenditure on environmental 

priorities and encourage green consumer choices. These could 
include eco-taxes, performance standards, public procurement 
strategies, green financing instruments such as green bonds, and 
green accounting mechanisms (UNEP 2010). Income from taxes 
related to environmental outcomes – on electricity, heating fuels, 
transport fuels, greenhouse gas emissions, air pollution, water 
and waste – raised 2–3 per cent of GDP in European countries 
in 2007, US$400 billion (€304 billion) in revenues or 6.2 per 
cent of total taxes and social contributions (Georgescu 2010). 
In addition, some countries, such as the United Kingdom, are 
establishing green infrastructure banks or greening existing 
investment institutions, while at the international level there are 
proposals to generate large-scale additional revenues through 
coordinated levies on aviation and shipping and financial 
transactions (Barbier 2012; Steckhan 2009). 

The term green economy was coined some 20 years ago in 
the publication Blueprint for a Green Economy (Pearce et al. 
1989). The authors argued that a green economy that values 
environmental assets, employs pricing policies and regulatory 
changes to translate these values into market incentives, and 
adjusts the economy’s measure of GDP for environmental loss 
was needed to ensure the well-being of current and future 
generations. A renewed focus on a green economy has resulted 
in reports on how to promote public and private investments in 
different sectors of the economy to help address unprecedented 
levels of environmental change and advance the sustainable 

474

Part 3: Global Responses

Box 17.6 Response option 3: Investing in enhanced capacities for addressing environmental change 

Establish a UN system-wide framework for capacity building. 
Such a framework would strengthen the national capacity 
required to implement environmental policies and could be 
an integral part of a system-wide strategy on the environment 
established within the wider institutional framework for 
sustainable development.

Adopt a green economy roadmap, possibly within the context 
of a sustainable development goals framework. A roadmap 
would set out how human well-being can be enhanced 
through public and private investments in the sectors of the 
economy that cover demand for, and supply of the goods, 
services and technologies needed to address unprecedented 
levels of environmental change, and that advance the 
sustainable use of natural resources. A combination of 
market-based mechanisms and regulatory structures might 
be needed to create employment and economic activities, 
but the appropriate policy mix would depend on national 
circumstances and contexts. The full spectrum of available 
measures includes public investments, green accounting, 
subsidies, taxes, charges, sustainable trade, creation of new 
markets, planning, standards, regulations, technological 
innovation, technology transfer and capacity building. 

Establish policy banks. This would enable the sharing 
of examples of sound environmental policy, design and 
implementation from different regions, including a green 
economy roadmap. This could provide opportunities for 
learning, adaptation or replication at an unprecedented 
scale, with the early involvement of multiple stakeholders 
facilitating the development and uptake of relevant reforms. 
Matching needs to the right policy tools is unlikely to occur 
organically without facilitation or brokerage. Governments 

and other actors could consider establishing decentralized, 
possibly open-access, web-based sustainability policy  
banks to: 
•	 act	as	a	repository	of	good	practices	for	learning	and	

replication;

•	 assist	governments	and	stakeholders	in	identifying	good	

practices for their priority areas for intervention;

•	 provide	a	forum	for	discussions	on	tailoring	policies	to	

national needs; and

•	 provide	rosters	of	experts	to	assist	in	realistic	applications	

in particular countries and at sub-national levels.

Principles for greener investments. A financial strategy 
could be built on a set of common principles, and a renewed 
commitment could be made to meeting existing obligations 
and creating sufficient and predictable funding to promote a 
green economy and sustainable living. These norms would 
serve to guide: 
•	 the	greening	of	existing	and	new	investments	to	

improve the environmental impacts and outcomes of all 
investments, including mainstreaming the environment in 
development expenditure; 

•	 raising	additional	resources	for	green	investments	through	

new mechanisms such as green taxation; and 

•	 public-private	partnerships	that	leverage	private	funding	
sources while also addressing environmental objectives. 

Establish a system for financial tracking. Regular reviews 
and renewal of funding commitments would further evolve 
private-public partnerships and scale up direct budget support 
to ensure mainstreaming of the environment in development, 
more effective participation in global processes and improved 
analytical capacity.

use of natural resources (UNEP 2011c, 2011d). There have been 
concerns that a green economy might create unsustainable jobs, 
lead to inequity, create trade distortions or promote new forms 
of green protectionism (UNEP 2011c). Such concerns would have 
to be addressed through existing mechanisms such as trade 
agreements and a balanced integration of the three pillars of 
sustainable development. A calibrated framework of sustainable 
development goals could guide an investment roadmap to the 
green economy and help ensure that such investments are 
socially and financially sustainable (Bina and Camera 2011).

In addition to increasing financing for the environment, a 
related, overarching priority would be to make all investment 
decisions – both public and private – greener. With US$24–30 
trillion to be invested in infrastructure globally over the 
next 20 years (CG/LA Infrastructure 2008), the challenge 
to integrate environmental considerations into investment 
decisions is daunting. A set of principles for green investment 

by institutional investors, governments and international 
bodies could accelerate the growing commitment to making 
investments greener. Many of the policy instruments mentioned 
above would deliver opportunities and benefits for both the 
environment and the economy (Part 2). 

Supporting technological innovation and development 
Technology has a substantial role to play in the effort to meet the 
most pressing global environmental challenges. Advanced and 
environmentally sustainable technologies can help developing 
economies leapfrog the resource-intensive, highly polluting 
growth phase. This is not just about technologically advanced 
solutions but also other adaptive ones. As technology systems 
include not only the deployment of hardware but also knowledge 
and know-how, lessons from traditional knowledge and practices 
can also be shared and adapted (IPCC 2001). Increased domestic 
capacity for innovation, including adapting existing technologies 
to local conditions, is an important goal for many countries.

Global Responses 475

Technologies can help improve environmental performance along 
the supply chain from resource extraction to manufacture and 
transportation and more efficient, greener end-use equipment 
for consumers. System-level technology links are often crucial 
for transformative change. For example, the smart grid concept 
aims to integrate electric vehicles, the power sector, information 
management and consumers into a single network. Technologies 
are also essential for successful adaptation to changing 
environments, from drought-resilient seeds through efficient 
methods of irrigation to flood defences.

But technologies and technological systems have a much 
broader role in green transformation than direct mitigation and 
adaptation. They play a key enabling role in such areas as remote 
and onsite monitoring of environmental change; early warning 
systems and new types of collaborative problem solving including 
crowdsourcing. Social networks are also having a significant 
but unpredictable impact on the environmental activity of 
governments, non-governmental organizations and communities.

In all of these areas, the ability of individuals, companies and 
institutions to absorb both new technologies and available finance 
varies in the different national contexts of developing countries 
(Ruggie 2008; Puustjarvi et al. 2003), making capacity building 
and demonstration projects key enabling factors (WBCSD 2010). 

Addressing the technology gap is at the fore of international 
negotiations on responses to environmental challenges. Since 
1990, developed countries have agreed to take all practicable 
steps to encourage the transfer of green technologies and 
know-how to developing countries. But this agenda has seen 
slow progress, with persistent disagreements even about what 
constitutes a technology transfer. The processes through which

large-scale transfers should occur are not straightforward, given 
that most technologies are owned by the private sector rather 
than governments. 

Some developing countries are critical of existing technology 
transfer regimes due to the high transaction costs of obtaining 
information or negotiating and acquiring technologies protected 
by intellectual property rights, and a lack of clarity in defining 

Box 17.7 Technology Mechanism at the UNFCCC

At the 2010 UN Climate Change Conference (COP 16) in 
Cancún, Mexico, governments agreed to establish a Technology 
Mechanism to facilitate technology cooperation and transfer. 
It comprises an executive committee and a climate technology 
centre and network. 

The priorities for this mechanism include the development and 
enhancement of the capacities and technologies of developing 
countries; deployment and diffusion of environmentally sound 
technologies and know-how; increased public and private 
investment in technology development, deployment, diffusion 
and transfer; strengthening of national systems of innovation 
and technology innovation centres; and development and 
implementation of national technology plans for mitigation and 
adaptation. Further, it is hoped that the technology mechanism 
will stimulate and encourage – through collaboration 
with the private sector, public institutions, academia and 
research institutions – the development and transfer of 

existing and emerging environmentally sound technologies 
and opportunities for North-South as well as South-South 
technology cooperation. 

In December 2011, governments adopted the modalities for 
the Technology Mechanism at the 17th Conference of the 
Parties in Durban. Since funding has always been a barrier to 
technology transfer to developing countries, the Green Climate 
Fund (GCF), newly established at Durban, could also help 
speed up implementation of the goals set by the international 
community to combat climate change, and promote a paradigm 
shift towards low-emission and climate-resilient development 
pathways. Though the UNFCCC process has been a useful 
forum to initiate global intergovernmental procedures to 
foster global technology transfer, collaborative work with the 
other multilateral environmental agreements, such as CBD, 
is also imperative to ensure the development and transfer of 
technologies for achieving other global environmental goals.

Box 17.8 Response option 4: Supporting technological innovation and development

Accelerating the innovation and diffusion of technologies 
is a critical element of any holistic support framework that 
seeks to encourage the uptake of environmentally sound 
technologies in the transition to a global green economy.  
This includes:

Collaborative R&D. Collaborative research for  
environmentally sustainable technologies could be 
coordinated between governments and the private sector 
for early pre-competitive stages of technology system 
development, before particular standards or industry value 
chains become embedded in national economies and the 
global industrial system, as happened in the semi-conductor 
market. Model technology cooperation agreements could 
take different levels of development and jurisdictional 
requirements into account to limit the potential of patent-
related conflicts and to encourage joint development. 
National laboratories could be twinned, or new ones set 
up that are multilaterally managed and funded in pursuit 
of agreed long-term technology objectives, ideally with the 
participation of industry.

Support for knowledge-sharing platforms. Collaborative 
initiatives on agriculture and the environment, such as the 
Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research 
(CGIAR), demonstrate the potential of stakeholder advice 
platforms and provide support for knowledge-sharing structures 
at the regional level. These initiatives could be emulated 
to scale up much needed environmentally sustainable 
technologies. Existing and potential barriers to the development 
and diffusion of such technologies could be assessed at the 
sectoral level to create the most appropriate incentives.

Global prize funds to stimulate innovation on green 
technologies. Prize funds and similar awards could be an 
effective means of bridging innovation gaps, including 
technologies to improve sustainability for the poor, as 
demonstrated by some successes in the public health and 
energy sectors. A range of global technology prizes could be 
established to promote innovation in all areas that support 
sustainability, especially for developing economies. Such 
prize funds could function as a patent pool and/or a 
repository for cross-licensing environmental technologies.

what is protected and what is not (Li and Correa 2009; Barton 
2007; Hutchison 2006; Commission for Intellectual Property 
Rights 2002). The impact of intellectual property (IP) rights on 
the technological advancement of developing countries varies 
according to the sector (Barton 2007), with countries like 
China and India making significant advances in technological 
development and acquisition despite the barriers (Puustjarvi 
et al. 2003). Maskus (2010) argues that although patents and 
IP rights may not in fact restrict access to environmentally 
sustainable technologies, there may be needs for beneficial 
differentiation in patent rights such as “ex ante extensions of 
patent terms tied to licensing commitments, expedited patent 
examinations in environmentally sustainable technologies, 
investments in patent transparency and landscaping efforts, and 
facilitation of voluntary patent pools”. 

Technological innovation has the potential to reduce the cost of 
achieving global environmental objectives (OECD 2010). The costs 
of implementing green policies have often turned out to be far 
lower than those projected, in part due to technological advances. 
Investment in research and development (R&D) is mostly 
undertaken by the private sector and is increasingly global in 
nature, but government actions and public policy can help leverage 
the power of markets to solve environmental challenges through 
innovation. Efforts to increase the flow of technology to developing 
countries and economies in transition include the UNFCCC decision 
to create a new Technology Mechanism (Box 17.7).

International cooperation is needed to build and strengthen 
innovation links between different sectors, especially between 

developed and developing economies. This is not least 
because many transformative approaches involve complex 
changes to technology systems and new forms of industrial 
models that are yet to be demonstrated at scale. International 
cooperative research could help pool development risks, share 
information (OECD 2011b) and overcome barriers to private-
sector investment. Yet innovation cooperation is primarily a 
national activity, not an international one. A study of six clean 
energy sectors points out that only 1.5 per cent of patents are 
co-assigned, listing more than one company or institution as 
co-owners, and only 2 per cent of these joint patents are shared 
between developed and developing economy companies and 
institutions (Lee et al. 2009). 

Strengthening rights-based approaches and access to 
environmental justice
Human and environmental rights can play a valuable role 
in ensuring that governments stay on track in meeting 
environmental goals and in providing safeguards against the 
adoption of environmental policies that reduce human and 
ecological well-being. Several important developments are 
evident in environmental rights. Adverse impacts on human 
health from environmental misuse are increasingly seen as 
violations of the human right to life (Kravchenko and Bonine 
2008). Further, globally agreed human rights frameworks 
increasingly emphasize the intersection between human well-
being and environmental health, as well as social-ecological 
resilience (Campese et al. 2009; ICHRP 2008; Jeffery 2005; 
Hunter et al. 2001), setting the basis for sustainability in 
environmental decision making.

undermining sustainable environmental management and the right to access to a clean environment. © Eric Miller/Still Picturesock

The environmental aspects of the current human rights framework 
are still too weak, however, to ensure that citizens are able to 
protect their well-being and hold governments accountable. In 
part, this is because environmental rights law at the global level 
is predominately soft law, making it easy for states to avoid 
their responsibility, with regional courts and judicial bodies not 
always able to ensure that their decisions are put into effect. 
For example, the decision of the African Commission on Human 
Rights that pollution from oil exploration in the Niger Delta that 
affects environmental quality and human health constitutes a 
violation of the right to a clean environment in the African Charter 
has never been put into effect. In contrast, implementation of the 
1998 United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) 
Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in 
Decision-making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters 
– the Aarhus Convention – demonstrates that effective procedural 
rights and state acceptance can be effective in protecting people 
and the environment. Replicating this approach regionally or 
globally is one option for giving effect to Rio Principle 10 by 
both state (UNECE 2011) and non-governmental organizations 
(Barreira 2012; UN-NGLS 2007). In 2011, the Meeting of the 
Parties to the Convention adopted a decision encouraging 
accession by states outside the UNECE region and a simplified 
procedure for doing so, creating a pathway for propagating the 
protection offered by this international environmental rights 
treaty on a global scale (UNECE 2010).

Although environmental rights are widely recognized, full access 
to justice at the national level can be difficult to implement. 
The effectiveness of legal systems has been hindered by 
local inability to access the courts, with a lack of financial 
resources, distance from courts, and language barriers being key 

challenges. Further, state entities do not always understand the 
nature of their obligations under environmental and human rights 
law (Serra and Tanner 2008). Global and regional investment in 
strengthening these national systems by enhancing citizen and 
state capacity could improve access to justice.

Despite its limitations, soft law can play a valuable role in 
shifting the culture of environmental practice by providing a 
basis for citizen advocacy, including claims for access to vital 
livelihood resources such as land and water; for governments 
to review their current practice; and for strengthening public 
participation in environmental decision making, particularly 
where citizens’ rights are affected. For example, with the 
adoption of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of 
Indigenous People (UNDRIP) (United Nations 2007), the United 
Nations agreed that all its activities must be based on the 
recognition of these rights. For example, the UN programme for 
Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation 
(UN-REDD) seeks to incorporate the UNDRIP rights into its 
practice and policy by, among other action, giving effect to the 
right to free prior informed consent. The recognition by the UN 
General Assembly of the human right to water and sanitation 
(Gupta et al. 2010) is another clear step forward to promote 
human rights. At the national level, the 1992 Rio Declaration on 
Environment and Development is widely accepted as a framework 
for allocating rights and responsibilities between states and 
citizens. Importantly, soft law can catalyse hard law agreements 
– the Aarhus Convention was negotiated in response to Principle 
10 of the Rio Declaration (UNCED 1992). 

Given current limitations within the human rights system, 
there is a renewed debate on the merits and drawbacks of a

Part 3: Global Responses

Box 17.9 Response option 5: Strengthening rights-based approaches and access to environmental justice

Recognize the links between human rights, environmental 
rights and the responsibilities of states, which can set the 
basis for better environmental performance where these rights 
are incorporated in decision making. Improving understanding 
of how this can be achieved through learning from best 
practice at inter-state and inter-regional levels should be 
facilitated. Existing human rights platforms could provide the 
basis for dialogue between diverse actors, including states, 
academics and communities, and strengthen and clarify 
understanding. 

Develop a global legal instrument, or a series of regional 
instruments, to strengthen access to information, public 
participation and access to justice in environmental matters, 
based on Principle 10 of the Rio Declaration and taking into 
consideration experience gained with the UNECE Aarhus 
Convention (1998).

Create a shared legal normative basis for action. Globally, 
a number of soft law norms have emerged to protect the 
environment in an equitable and responsible manner. There is, 

however, a need for a legal process to promote the hardening 
of these norms into legally binding rights and responsibilities 
that would provide a shared legal normative basis for action. 

Recognize and support the different kinds of dispute 
resolution systems, including indigenous systems to ensure 
that justice is delivered. Although a number of formal and 
alternative dispute resolution systems are being developed in 
different forums, and national courts are offering non-nationals 
the right to seek adjudication on their environmental claims, 
there is need for a process that recognizes and supports these 
kinds of dispute resolution processes. 
 
Establish a process for creating an international environmental 
court to address violations of environmental standards. 
Agreeing to a process for considering the establishment of an 
international environmental court is an important first step in 
improving dispute resolution. It is important to build on the 
experience of existing judicial systems at the regional level and 
within the human rights field, avoid duplication and ensure 
sufficient human capacity and finance. 

judicial system for the environment at the international level. 
Options discussed range from an international court for the 
environment to enhanced complaint mechanisms to turning 
environmental and related equity rights into law (Klabbers et al. 
2009). A number of models have been proposed as a template 
for an International Court for the Environment (ICE), which could 
function as a Court of First Instance for the International Court 
of Justice, rendering decisions and/or advisory opinions, or 
act as a specialized environmental tribunal in the spirit of the 
Permanent Court of Arbitration, or could provide a combination 
of negotiation, conciliation, arbitration and adjudication similar 
to the Dispute Settlement Body of the WTO. Furthering the ICE, 
the International Court for the Environment Coalition (2011) 
proposed three characteristics for it: 
•	 the	court	or	tribunal	should	have	specialized	environmental	
judges or a process that addresses the current gaps between 
international law and environmental science; 

•	 its	standing	should	be	offered	to	non-state	actors,	provided	

the cases satisfied a materiality threshold, i.e. what is 
considered relevant or material to a case; and 

•	 the	court	should	incorporate	the	common	law	principle	

of stare decisis, which would establish precedence in the 
international environmental legal order.

Traditional adjudication, however, faces some significant 
constraints, which could reduce the court’s effectiveness in 
resolving international resource disputes, such as those over 
the use and sharing of natural resources. Analysis of the use of 
adjudication by international courts and tribunals reveals four 
categories of limitation: 

•	 parties	may	refuse	to	submit	to	adjudication;
•	 the	judicial	decision	might	not	address	the	merits	of	the	

dispute; 

•	 non-compliance	is	not	punishable;	and	
•	 recurrence	of	the	dispute	or	conflict	(Spain	2011).	

These constraints can be overcome through the use of integrated 
methods for dispute settlement and resolution. Ultimately, 
however, successful resolution of international resource dispute 
hinges on the availability of mechanisms – judicial or otherwise 
– that allow for the active engagement of non-state actors 
and for addressing the concerns of all parties with legitimacy, 
fairness and speed.

Deepening and broadening stakeholder engagement 
The complexity and varied nature of global environmental 
challenges facing the international community today, as 
demonstrated in Part 1, require a range of interventions beyond 
action by public institutions. Many of the solutions described 
in Part 2 also demand collective action by civil society, private 
sector actors, the media and academic and research institutions. 

The role of civil society actors in supporting global environmental 
governance has evolved over the past 40 years to create groups 
that operate from the local to the global level, offering means by 
which to connect global policy to local action. Non-governmental 
organizations tend to be more flexible than governments and 
intergovernmental agencies, and can therefore offer swift support 
for seeking and implementing solutions. They frequently have the 
capacity to conduct in-depth research, collect and disseminate

Box 17.10 Social learning 

Social learning comprises formal or informal processes to 
share knowledge and lessons, at different levels and across 
different communities, to support innovative problem solving 
required for addressing unprecedented environmental change. 
Social learning is as much about changes in relationships 
and in individual and collective attitudes and mindsets as it 
is about practical tools and institutional change to deal with 
new challenges (Pahl-Wostl 2006). Platforms for social learning 
include, for example, biotechnology citizens’ juries (Pimbert 
2011), Oxfam’s climate dialogues and the United Nations 
Human Rights Council’s Social Forum.

Access to technology and information is vital, but not 
sufficient, for effective social learning. Governance and the 
dynamics of interaction between actors are important factors 
that determine what knowledge and experience is shared 
and how it is used. In order to be effective, collaborative 
learning requires open communication, engagement outside 

established decision-making circles, consideration of multiple 
kinds of knowledge, unrestrained thinking and self-reflection 
(Woodhill 2010; Keen et al. 2005; Schulster et al. 2003).

At the global scale, social learning can be fostered by 
facilitating institutional openness, multi-level governance both 
horizontal and vertical, and dialogue between sectors as well 
as between different communities. Specific options for a strong 
global response to foster social learning include: 
•	 promoting	actor	and	stakeholder	learning	networks	–	South-
South, global inter-generational dialogues and private-public; 

•	 cross-	and	multi-actor	participation	in	international	
decision making such as Conferences of the Parties; 

•	 improved	transparency	and	access	to	information;	
•	 support	of	experimentation	and	variation;	and	
•	 improvement	of	monitoring	and	regular	reviews	of	policies	

and experiments using rigorous analysis and providing 
rapid feedback on success or failure.

data, and support assessment and monitoring  (Gemmill and 
Bamidele-Izu 2002), together with awareness raising and public 
mobilization. Similarly, academic institutions can offer unique 
support for global responses by granting credibility through 
scientific and technical support. Non-governmental organizations 
and academic institutions together contribute to increasing 
public participation, creating and maintaining knowledge 
networks and facilitating the diffusion of knowledge and ideas 
(Ramos 2009; Eriksson and Sundelius 2005; Stone and Maxwell 
2005). The recently launched Global University Partnership 
on Environment and Sustainability (GUPES), a UNEP-planned 

consultative, sharing and learning platform for university leaders 
from developed and developing countries, offers a possible 
model for collaboration between international organizations and 
universities (UNEP 2011b). 

As attempts to transition to a green economy advance, business 
engagement in a variety of ways and at multiple scales can also 
bring added value to global responses. The Montreal Protocol 
offers an example of a successful international environmental 
treaty, in which a critical element in the negotiations was 
the inclusion of businesses and NGOs in drafting the treaty

and supporting its implementation. In treating businesses 
as collaborators rather than constituents, they can become 
engaged in the problem, the strategy and the implementation 
(Ivanova et al. 2007). Some also benefit from being first movers 
in commercial terms. While the Montreal Protocol was relatively 
limited in its scope and fairly straightforward in terms of policy 
decisions, this strategy could offer useful lessons for other 
agreements and initiatives. 

Businesses have also taken the lead in developing private 
certification schemes, which are an emerging approach to 
environmental governance. Supply-chain management guidelines 
have been effective in promoting sustainable practices in forestry 
through the Forest Stewardship Council, and fisheries by the 
Marine Stewardship Council (Auld et al. 2008; Cashore et al. 2004) 
and for establishing broader global standards of corporate social 
responsibility through the United Nations Global Compact (Ruggie 
2001). Such efforts depend on proper institutional design that 
includes legitimate third-party verification, supportive government 
institutions at the national level, clear relationships between 
the private sector and civil society and a public awareness of the 
meaning of the codes. Schemes initially focused on one sector can 
lead to similar approaches being applied in others, as public and 
corporate awareness and experience develop. Similarly, national 
schemes are sometimes scaled up to the regional or international 
level. The dangers of voluntary approaches for environmental 
policy, however, include their non-enforceability, poor monitoring 
and a lack of transparency (OECD 1999).

Collaboration and engagement of sub-national authorities is 
another important element of public participation. Cities, for 
example, have embarked on environmental and sustainability 

Box 17.11 Cities and climate action

action of their own (Box 17.11). While bottom-up initiatives 
such as these might not deliver the necessary degree of change, 
the proactive measures provide channels for implementation, 
engagement and feedback on the efficacy of policy (Otto-
Zimmerman 2011). 

Many cities worldwide have begun to take climate action, 
illustrating the important role that sub-national actors can play 
in addressing global environmental problems. Most city efforts 
thus far have focused on mitigation rather than adaptation 
(Hoornweg et al. 2011), with more than 2 000 cities now 
committed to reducing their greenhouse gas emissions (ICLEI 
2010). Their motivations for taking climate action is complex 
and varied, typically reflecting frustration with the limited 
progress in international negotiations and the desire of city 
leaders to respond to citizens’ concerns. 

Climate action by cities and sub-national regions has also 
taken on a global dimension. Cities are increasingly acting in 
concert and learning from one another, with little distinction 
between North and South. Globally, the landscape of networks 
and entities active in climate change adaptation and mitigation 
at the city level is emerging but fragmented: these include 
the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group, ICLEI – Local 
Governments for Sustainability, the World Mayors Council 

on Climate Change, the Covenant of Mayors and the Climate 
Alliance in Europe, and the Climate Protection Agreement of 
the United States Conference of Mayors. 

Climate action by cities has increasingly been recognized by 
national governments and at the international level. Although 
the UNFCCC and its Kyoto Protocol did not originally include 
any explicit role for cities, this has been changing. The 
16th Conference of the Parties in Cancun recognized local 
governments as key governmental stakeholders in global climate 
change efforts, with numerous references in Decision CP.16. 
More recently, ICLEI – Local Governments for Sustainability 
has called for a framework of global environmental governance 
that includes local and sub-national governments as part of 
a multi-stakeholder system of collaborative policy setting, 
implementation and accountability (Otto-Zimmerman 2011). The 
European Union has also called for new governance modes that 
foster social innovation and that adopt an holistic approach to 
environmental and energy issues in cities (EC 2011).

Box 17.12 Response option 6: Deepening and broadening stakeholder engagement

Build a stakeholder web for sustainability. Non-state actors and 
the private sector could be invited to explore how the modalities 
of a stakeholder web could evolve by building on existing 
structures and utilizing modern information and communication 
technologies including social media. The web could help identify 
issues on which the public sector may need to act in terms of 
implementation of the Rio Declaration’s Principle 10 as it relates 
to access to information and stakeholder engagement. Principle 
10 could also act as a platform to mobilize new partnerships for 
action towards implementing internationally agreed goals and 
targets, such as a possible framework of sustainable development 
goals and the transition towards an inclusive green economy. 

Establish an inter-generational assembly. An inter-
generational assembly could provide an opportunity for  
future leaders and sustainability champions to interact  
and foster a joint vision for a sustainable future. The idea  
of the assembly could be taken up as part of the current 
reform process, building on discussions at the UN Conference 
on Sustainable Development. In terms of concrete outputs, 
the assembly could also promote access to information  
and shared accountability through innovative tools that 
would support decision making, including a global database 
of conceptual innovations in environmental governance  
and management.

While the public sector is an essential agent in creating enabling 
conditions for societal change, the private sector and civil society 
are also core agents. The implementation of the Rio Declaration’s 
Principle 10 could help further empower individuals, the private 
sector and non-state actors in responding to environmental 
problems. The principle, amongst others, recognizes that each 
individual should have appropriate access to information about 
the environment that is held by public authorities, and that 
states should facilitate and encourage public awareness and 
participation by making information widely available. Although 
stakeholder participation in intergovernmental affairs and 
public-private partnerships has evolved through, for example, the 
Commission on Sustainable Development, a greater deepening 
and broadening of stakeholder engagement, through using 
modern information and communication technologies for example, 
could make society better prepared to respond to the scale of 
environmental change. Civil society and the private sector could 
be invited to develop a stakeholder web for sustainability, building 
on existing structures aimed at mobilizing action to implement 
internationally agreed goals and targets.

Current decision-making processes tend to focus on the 
short term – to the probable detriment of future generations. 
Explicit future orientation is an important element of adaptive 
governance strategies for sustainable development and, while 
foresight processes are a regular part of decision-making 
processes (de Lattre-Gasquet 2009; Green and Stewart 2004), 
broader mechanisms to help strengthen the voice of future 
generations could be considered. 

Governments possess various options to strengthen the voice 
of future generations at various levels (Brown Weiss 1992). They 
can install an office that has responsibility for ensuring that the 
interests of future generations are considered, for investigating 
complaints and for providing warnings of emerging problems. 
States could also give standing in their national courts and 
administrative bodies to a representative of future generations, 
who might function as a guardian. Another approach is to 
designate an ombudsman for future generations or to appoint 

commissioners for future generations who could operate 
internationally, nationally or locally. This was advocated by 
the World Commission on Environment and Development and 
in some countries, Hungary for example, experiments are now 
under way with ombudsmen – who in national law have the 
responsibility to safeguard social and environmental conditions 
to the benefit of future generations (JNO 2010). 

CONCLUSION: RESPONDING TO EARTH SYSTEM 
CHALLENGES
When the international community last took stock of the state of 
the environment in 2007 as part of the GEO-4 process, promises 
and recommendations were made to tackle the environmental 
challenges. But neither the scope of environmental policy 
nor the speed of its implementation has been sufficient. 
Efforts to reduce the pressures from the underlying drivers – 
including enhanced resource efficiency and climate mitigation 
measures – may have resulted in moderate successes but have 
fundamentally failed to reduce environmental problems on a 
global scale. 

Five years on, it is clearer than ever that there is no global panacea 
or single, overarching solution to environmental challenges. 
Rather, collective action built around strategies, values, 
principles, investments and measures, supported by a diverse 
range of competencies and capacities, needs to be woven into 
the fabric of nations, international society and its institutions. 
Ultimately, the prospect for improving human well-being is 
critically dependent on the capacity of individuals and countries 
as well as the global community to respond – through mitigation 
and adaptation – to environmental change. While the modalities 
of multilateral cooperation need to be kept under review to ensure 
their effectiveness, the key challenge of addressing capacity 
issues in the developed and developing world remains.

As GEO-5 demonstrates, however, notwithstanding the 
enormous challenges, there are great opportunities to scale 
up policies that could help take the world’s citizens along 
trajectories that begin to reverse negative environmental

trends, and that address the inequalities and inadequacies 
of the institutional frameworks within which human society 
operates. It is also imperative for the international community 
to invest in solutions that will help tackle the root causes, not 
merely the symptoms, of environmental degradation, from 
fundamental shifts in values through the design and structure 
of institutions to innovative policy frameworks. Modified to 
reflect the global scale, a systematic and comprehensive 
results-based global approach could be anchored in the six 
response options outlined in this chapter.

The 2012 United Nations Conference on Sustainable 
Development (Rio+20) provides an opportunity for the 
international community to take stock, assess achievements 
and shortcomings, and stimulate transformative global 
responses. It is also an opportunity for the international 
community, from individual member states to the United 
Nations, to demonstrate political leadership in tackling these 
complex challenges. This chapter has identified a number of 
response options that together could help society address the 
problems of global environmental change. While these do not 
guarantee success, they expose, clearly and systematically, 
whether or not progress is being made. In addition, evaluation 
and collective learning could enable the identification 

of barriers to implementation. This, in turn, could inform 
adjustments and adaptive management as part of a larger, 
systemic approach to global governance. 

Integrated governance of socio-ecological systems must be 
cross-sectoral, cross-scale, and across time. Authority and 
accountability must be dispersed to the appropriate level of 
decision-making – subsidiarity – while including a broad set of 
actors beyond the state and enhancing their capacity. 

At the global level, it remains a daunting challenge to design 
and implement effective measures that can motivate citizens, 
companies, institutions, networks and governments to cooperate 
and deliver ambitious policies and action. Highlighting the 
rewards of cooperation and shared purpose could embolden 
efforts to overcome barriers and past trajectories, reversing 
unsustainable trends that that were once considered 
insurmountable. The rewards of progress are often obscured 
against a landscape fraught with challenges and inequities. 
In the end, openness to possibility – reflecting the optimism, 
creativity and potential of young people around the world – and 
investing in an environment in which multiple sustainable and 
desirable solutions can emerge, would probably be the most 
effective, and meaningful, global response.

“There is a huge amount to be done if we are to reach a state of sustainability. 
Do not despair, do not be weighed down by it. All I ask of you is that you go home 
and do what you can.”

Wangari Maathai (1940-2011), Nobel Lauriate.

The GEO-5 Process

MANDATE
In February 2009, as part of UNEP’s overall mandate to keep 
the global environment under review, the 25th Session of the 
UNEP Governing Council/Global Ministerial Environment Forum 
reconfirmed the Global Environmental Outlook (GEO) mandate, 
requesting the Executive Director to:

“continue to conduct a comprehensive, integrated and 
scientifically credible global environmental assessment, 
avoiding duplication and building on ongoing assessment 
work, to support decision-making processes at all levels, in 
the light of the continuing need for up-to-date, scientifically 
credible, policy-relevant information on environmental 
change worldwide, including analyses of cross-cutting  
issues and indicator-based components” 

and to:

“strengthen the policy relevance of GEO-5 by including an 
analysis of case studies of policy options, that incorporates 
environmental, economic, social and scientific data and 
information and their indicative costs and benefits to 
identify promising policy options to speed up achievement 
of the internationally agreed goals such as those agreed 
at the Millennium Summit in 2000 and in Multilateral 
Environmental Agreements” (UNEP/GC.25/2/III) (http://
www.unep.org/gc/gc25/Docs/Proceedings-English.pdf).

Support for the fifth Global Environment Outlook (GEO-5) was 
further approved in November 2011 by the United Nations 
General Assembly 2nd Committee (Economic and Financial) 
(resolution A/C.2/66/L.57) (http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/
UNDOC/LTD/N11/601/65/PDF/N1160165.pdf).

OBJECTIVES, SCOPE AND PROCESS 
The objectives, scope and process for GEO-5 were defined and 
adopted in a Final Statement by the Global Intergovernmental 
and Multi-stakeholder Consultation that took place in March 
2010 and included 91 governmental representatives and 55 
other main stakeholders. 

Objectives
The consultation reaffirmed the above mandate by identifying  
the following objectives for the assessment:
•	 provide a comprehensive, integrated and scientifically 
credible global environmental assessment to support 
decision-making processes at appropriate levels;

•	 engage all governments, relevant UN bodies, and other 

stakeholders in GEO-5 in order to support and strengthen  
its scientific credibility, policy relevance and legitimacy;

•	 strengthen the on-going process of capacity building 

for developing countries and countries with economies 
in transition to conduct environmental monitoring and 

assessments at all levels, in collaboration with relevant 
on-going activities of UNEP and other initiatives, including 
through south-south and triangular cooperation;

•	 inform, as appropriate, the strategic directions of UNEP and 

other relevant UN bodies;

•	 strengthen the policy relevance of GEO-5 by including an analysis 
of case studies of policy options, that incorporates environmental, 
economic, social and scientific data and information and their 
indicative costs and benefits to identify promising policy options 
to speed up achievement of the internationally agreed goals 
such as those agreed at the Millennium Summit in 2000 and in 
multilateral environmental agreements; 

•	 inform and learn from relevant global and regional processes 
and meetings where progress towards these agreed goals  
is discussed; and

•	 identify data gaps in the thematic issues considered by GEO-5.

Scope
GEO-5 builds on previous GEO reports and continues to provide 
an analysis of the state, trends and outlook of the global 
environment. It differs from previous GEO reports in its emphasis 
on internationally agreed goals and in providing possible means 
of accelerating achievement of those goals. GEO-5 is made up of 
three distinct but closely linked parts.

Part 1 assesses the state and trends of the global environment 
in relation to key internationally agreed goals such as the 
Millennium Development Goals and those of various multilateral 
environmental agreements. The assessment is based on national, 
regional and global analyses and datasets. 

Part 2 prioritizes a number of environmental themes per region, 
selected through a consultative process in light of relevant 
internationally agreed goals. The regional assessments identify 
and appraise promising policy responses that could help speed 
up the achievement of these goals.

Part 3 identifies options with potential to assist the transition 
towards sustainable development and suggests possibilities for 
global response. 

The consultation proposed ten key questions for UNEP to 
address. To a great extent, these questions helped define the 
scope of the GEO-5 assessment and to guide the process. 

Key questions for Part 1
i.  What are the current drivers, state and trends and outlook 

for the global environment?

ii.  Do the current drivers, state and trends of the 
environment reflect progress towards meeting 
internationally agreed goals?

iii.  What are the main challenges for the life-supporting functions 

of the Earth System and the drivers that cause them?

The GEO-5 Process 489

iv.  To what extent do existing monitoring and observation 

•	 establishing three overarching advisory groups: a High-

activities and institutional arrangements meet the need to 
keep the state and trends of the environment under review?

v.  What are the main gaps and barriers to meeting the 

agreed goals?

Key questions for Part 2
vi.  Which internationally agreed goals are high priorities for 

each region?

vii.  What policy options can be most successfully applied 

in each region to help speed up meeting internationally 
agreed goals?

viii.  What policy options facilitate environmental monitoring 

and its use in decision making?

Key questions for Part 3
ix.  What policy approaches could be suitable for scaling up in 

order to accelerate meeting internationally agreed goals?

x.  What types of sustainable change and innovation are 

needed over the long term?

Process
The March 2010 consultation also provided direction for 
strengthening the process of the GEO-5 assessment through:
•	 engaging the best available scientific and policy expertise; 
•	 ensuring scientific credibility, policy relevance, and legitimacy 
of the assessment by engaging a wide range of stakeholders; 
•	 constituting multidisciplinary groups of experts nominated by 

governments and other stakeholders using a transparent process; 

Level Intergovernmental Advisory Panel to provide guidance 
to experts; a Science and Policy Advisory Board to ensure 
the scientific credibility of the process; and a Data and 
Indicators Working Group to provide core data support to  
the process; 

•	 subjecting the assessment to extensive scientific expert peer-

review and government review; 

•	 continuing to target institutional capacity building by engaging 

developing country experts; and 

•	 communicating key messages and findings to target 

audiences in an accessible manner. 

PARTNERSHIPS AND COLLABORATION
The development of GEO-5 involved extensive collaboration 
both within UNEP and between UNEP and a network of 
multidisciplinary experts, research institutions and GEO 
collaborating centres, all of whom made their valuable time and 
knowledge available to the process. 

The consultation requested that experts for content 
development, including reviewers and advisory groups, be 
nominated by governments and other main stakeholders 
including GEO collaborating centres and other partners, based on 
their expertise and using a transparent process drawing from the 
nomination process of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change (IPCC). The nominated experts were then engaged by 
the UNEP Secretariat on the basis of their expertise, with due 
consideration of gender and regional balances.

Chapter expert groups
The GEO-5 report has 17 chapters. An expert working group was 
established for each chapter to conceptualize, research, draft, 
revise and finalize the manuscripts. More than 310 authors 
were involved in content development. Each chapter expert 
group included 5–38 individuals under the leadership of two 
or three coordinating lead authors and supported by a UNEP 
chapter coordinator. Other members of the chapter expert groups 
comprised lead authors and contributing authors. 

GEO-5 fellows
GEO-5 continued to pursue the Fellowship initiative established 
during the GEO-4 process in 2005. This engages early career 
professionals in the GEO process so that they can gain experience 
from participating in a major global environmental assessment. A 
total of 21 fellows from 18 countries participated in GEO-5.

Outreach working group
An outreach working group was established that included one 
member of each chapter expert group as well as UNEP experts. 
The group prepared the overarching outreach strategy for GEO-5  
and identified target audiences and relevant meetings to 
disseminate findings.

REVIEW PROCESS
The GEO-5 assessment underwent three rounds of review involving 
more than 300 experts. The first was an internal one within UNEP; 
the second was an external review by governments and UNEP’s 
extensive network of science and policy experts, including those 

nominated by governments and other stakeholders. The final 
review was undertaken by governments and well-known scientific 
experts from both the natural and social science communities. 
The final round of expert review was an independent peer-review 
process facilitated by the Earth System Science Partnership (ESSP). 
The ESSP sent a call for reviewers to its global expert network and 
then selected interested experts based on their field as well as 
gender and geographical balance. In the final expert peer review, 
each chapter had three to four expert scientific reviewers with 
extensive experience in the subject area covered by the respective 
chapter. The content development process and all review stages 
were supported by the Science and Policy Advisory Board who 
provided guidance to chapter authors, reviewers and the UNEP 
Secretariat to ensure that the process was scientifically credible 
and robust. 

GEO-5 advisory groups
Three external specialized advisory bodies were established to 
support the assessment process.

High-Level Intergovernmental Advisory Panel 
The panel comprised 20 high-level government representatives 
from all six UNEP regions. The panel, using the Global 
Environmental Goals framework (for more detail see http:/geg.
informea.org/goals), identified the internationally agreed goals for 
GEO-5 to assess, and formulated strategic advice to GEO-5 authors 
and other groups to assist them in their assessment of the goals. 
They also provided initial guidance on the structure and content 
of the GEO-5 Summary for Policy Makers and further guidance

to the experts in finalizing the draft in preparation for the final 
intergovernmental negotiation. In addition, ad-hoc guidance was 
provided to UNEP throughout the assessment process, in particular 
in aligning the GEO-5 process with the relevant processes of the 
2012 United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development 
(Rio+20). The panel met three times in 2010 and 2011.

Science and Policy Advisory Board
The board comprised 18 distinguished scientists and senior 
representatives from the policy community and met twice in 
2011. The board was responsible for strengthening the scientific 
credibility and policy relevance of the assessment by providing 
guidance throughout the process. They provided high-level 
strategic advice; standards and guidelines for the assessment 
and review process; and undertook a mid-term and final 
evaluation of the assessment process.

Data and Indicators Working Group
The group met once in March 2011 and provided support to the 
assessment process on the use of core datasets and indicators. 
They consulted with experts to identify priority environmental 
indicators and identified available datasets, as well as data gaps 
and related issues. 

CONSULTATION PROCESS
UNEP organized global and regional consultations and meetings 
throughout the assessment process. The following are some of the 
key meetings convened since the inception in November 2009. 

GEO-5 planning meetings
Two planning meetings were convened with experts familiar  
with the GEO process, including UNEP’s GEO specialists, in 
November 2009 and January 2010. The meetings focused on 
reviewing lessons learned from the previous GEO processes and 
the implementation of Governing Council Decision 25/2/III.  
The experts formulated UNEP’s analytical framework and a 
vision of the future global assessment to propose to the Global 
Intergovernmental and Multi-stakeholder Consultation on GEO-5.

Global Intergovernmental and Multi-stakeholder Consultation
This consultation defined and adopted the scope, objectives and 
process for GEO-5 in March 2010. 

Regional consultations
A series of seven regional consultations were held between 
September and October 2010. The consultations, which 
engaged many different stakeholders, determined five or six 
priority environmental challenges in each region and selected 
internationally agreed goals of relevant concern, as well as 
identifying potential policy options in the region, implementation 
of which could speed up meeting the selected goals.

Policy expert meeting
In October 2010 a policy expert group, including one policy 
expert from each region nominated to participate in the GEO-5 
regional policy analysis, as well as several independent policy 
experts, was convened to discuss the challenge of policy analysis 
in the context of identifying policies that help speed up the

attainment of internationally agreed goals. The policy expert 
group provided guidelines for the regional policy analysis.

Global production and authors’ meetings
Two global production and authors’ meetings were convened 
in November 2010 and in September 2011 to discuss and 
develop GEO-5 chapter content and outlines, to address 
review comments, and to harmonize different approaches and 
presentation styles. 

Chapter working group meetings 
More than 30 meetings were convened to prepare, review and 
revise the drafts for individual chapters. 

Summary for Policy Makers intergovernmental meeting 
A final open-ended intergovernmental meeting was convened 
in January 2012 in the City of Gwangju, Republic of Korea, to 
negotiate and endorse the GEO-5 Summary for Policy Makers 
(SPM). The meeting, attended by 53 governments, endorsed the 
summary, which presents the policy-relevant findings of GEO-5 
and is published as a separate document. The GEO-5 Summary 
for Policy Makers was launched at the 12th Special Session of 
the Governing Council/Global Ministerial Environment Forum in 
February 2012.

The launch of GEO-5 will coincide with the final preparatory stages 
of the UN Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20), taking 
place two decades after the UN Conference on Environment and 
Development (Rio Earth Summit) set the agenda for the transition 
to sustainable development. GEO-5 highlights the current state, 
trends and outlook for the planet and its people, and showcases 
more than 100 initiatives, projects and policies that are pioneering 
positive environmental change across the globe.
 
GEO-5 highlights not just the perils of delaying action, but the options 
for transforming sustainable development from theory to reality.

Abundance
The number of individuals or related measure of quantity (such 
as biomass) in a population, community or spatial unit.

Abrupt change
The change that takes place so rapidly and unexpectedly that 
human or natural systems have difficulty adapting to it. 

Acidification
Change in natural chemical balance caused by an increase in the 
concentration of acidic elements.

Acidity
A measure of how acid a solution may be. A solution with a pH of 
less than 7.0 is considered acidic.

Adaptation
Adjustment in natural or human systems to a new or changing 
environment, including anticipatory and reactive adaptation, 
private and public adaptation, and autonomous and planned 
adaptation.

Adaptive capacity
The potential or ability of a system, region or community to 
adapt to the effects or impacts of a particular set of changes. 
Enhancement of adaptive capacity is a practical means of coping 
with changes and uncertainties, reducing vulnerabilities and 
promoting sustainable development.

Adaptive governance
A governance approach that incorporates methods of adaptive 
management, adaptive policy making and transition management 
for addressing complex, uncertain and dynamic issues. Adaptive 

governance relies on polycentric institutional arrangements for 
decision making at multiple scales. Spanning the local and global 
levels, this form of governance provides for collaborative, flexible, 
learning-based approaches to ecosystem management.

Adaptive environmental governance
The process of design and execution of policy based on 
contemporary understanding and ongoing analysis of evolving 
environmental problems. Spanning the local and global levels, 
it relies on polycentric institutional arrangements for decision-
making at multiple scales and provides for evidence-based, 
consultative and participatory ecosystem management able to 
evolve along with the problems it aims to address.

Adaptive management
A systematic management paradigm that assumes natural 
resource management policies and actions are not static, but are 
adjusted based on the combination of new scientific and socio-
economic information.

Aerosols
A collection of airborne solid or liquid particles, with a typical 
size between 0.01 and 10 micrometres (µm), that reside in the 
atmosphere for at least several hours. Aerosols may be of either 
natural or anthropogenic origin.

Afforestation
Establishment of forest plantations on land that is not classified 
as forest.

Alien species (also non-native, non-indigenous, foreign, exotic)
Species accidentally or deliberately introduced outside its normal 
distribution.

Glossary 505

Anthropocene 
A term used by scientists to name a new geologic epoch 
(following the most recent Holocene) characterized by significant 
changes in the Earth’s atmosphere, biosphere and hydrosphere 
due primarily to human activities. 

Anthroposphere
The total human presence throughout the Earth System including 
its culture, technology, built environment, and activities 
associated with these. The anthroposphere complements the 
term Anthropocene. 

Aquatic ecosystem
Basic ecological unit composed of living and non-living elements 
interacting in water.

Arable land
Land under temporary crops (double-cropped areas are counted 
only once), temporary meadows for mowing or pasture, land 
under market and kitchen gardens, and land temporarily fallow 
(less than five years). The abandoned land resulting from shifting 
cultivation is not included in this category.

Billion
109 (1 000 000 000)

Bioaccumulation
The increase in concentration of a chemical in organisms. Also 
used to describe the progressive increase in the amount of a 
chemical in an organism resulting from rates of absorption of 
a substance in excess of its metabolism and excretion.

Biocapacity
The capacity of ecosystems to produce useful biological materials 
and to absorb waste materials generated by humans, using 
current management schemes and extraction technologies. The 
biocapacity of an area is calculated by multiplying the actual 
physical area by the yield factor and the appropriate equivalence 
factor. Biocapacity is usually expressed in units of global hectares.

Biodiversity (a contraction of biological diversity)
The variety of life on Earth, including diversity at the genetic 
level, among species and among ecosystems and habitats. It 
includes diversity in abundance, distribution and behaviour. 
Biodiversity also incorporates human cultural diversity, which 
can both be affected by the same drivers as biodiversity, and 
itself has impacts on the diversity of genes, other species 
and ecosystems.

Biofuel
Fuel produced from dry organic matter or combustible oils from 
plants, such as alcohol from fermented sugar or maize, and oils 
derived from oil palm, rapeseed or soybeans.

Biogas
Gas, rich in methane, which is produced by the fermentation 
of animal dung, human sewage or crop residues in an airtight 
container.

Biogeochemical cycles
The flow of chemical elements and compounds between 
living organisms (biosphere) and the physical environment 
(atmosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere).

Biological corridor 
A section of habitat designated to restore or conserve the 
connection between habitats that have been fragmented by 
human or natural causes.

Biomass
Organic material, above and below ground and in water, both 
living and dead, such as trees, crops, grasses, tree litter and roots.

Biomagnification
The build up of certain substances in the bodies of organisms at 
higher trophic levels of food webs. Organisms at lower trophic 
levels accumulate small amounts. Organisms at the next higher 
level of the food chain eat many of these lower-level organisms 
and hence accumulate larger amounts. The tissue concentration 
increases at each trophic level in the food web when there is 
efficient uptake and slow elimination

Biome
The largest unit of ecosystem classification that is convenient to 
recognize below the global level. Terrestrial biomes are typically 
based on dominant vegetation structure (such as forest or grassland). 
Ecosystems within a biome function in a broadly similar way, although 
they may have very different species composition. For example, all 
forests share certain properties regarding nutrient cycling, disturbance 
and biomass that are different from the properties of grasslands.

Biosphere
The part of the Earth and its atmosphere in which living 
organisms exist or that is capable of supporting life.

Biotechnology (modern)
The application of in vitro nucleic acid techniques, including 
recombinant deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and direct injection 
of nucleic acid into cells or organelles, or fusion of cells beyond 
the taxonomic family, that overcome natural physiological, 
reproductive or recombination barriers and that are not 
techniques used in traditional breeding and selection.

Black carbon
Operationally defined aerosol based on measurement of light 
absorption and chemical reactivity and/or thermal stability. 
Black carbon is formed through the incomplete combustion 
of fossil fuels, biofuel and biomass, and is emitted as part of 
anthropogenic and naturally occurring soot. It consists of pure 
carbon in several linked forms. Black carbon warms the Earth 
by absorbing sunlight and re-emitting heat to the atmosphere 
and by reducing albedo (the ability to reflect sunlight) when 
deposited on snow and ice.

Blue water
Fresh surface and groundwater, in other words, the water in 
freshwater lakes, rivers and aquifers. The blue water footprint 

506

Glossary

is the volume of surface and groundwater consumed as a result 
of the production of a good or service. Blue water consumption 
refers to the volume of freshwater used and then evaporated or 
incorporated into a product. It also includes water abstracted 
from surface or groundwater in a catchment and returned 
to another catchment or the sea. It is the amount of water 
abstracted from groundwater or surface water that does not 
return to the catchment from which it was withdrawn. 

Bleaching (of coral reefs)
A phenomenon occurring when corals under stress expel their 
mutualistic microscopic algae, called zooxanthellae. This 
results in a severe decrease or even total loss of photosynthetic 
pigments. Since most reef-building corals have white calcium 
carbonate skeletons, these then show through the corals’ tissue 
and the coral reef appears bleached.

Capacity development
The process through which individuals, organizations and 
societies obtain, strengthen and maintain the capabilities to 
set and achieve their own development objectives over time.

Cap and trade (system)
A regulatory or management system that sets a target level for 
emissions or natural resource use, and, after distributing shares 
in that quota, lets trading in those permits determine their price.

Capital
Resource that can be mobilized in the pursuit of an individual’s 
goals. Thus, natural capital (natural resources such as land and 
water), physical capital (technology and artefacts), social capital 
(social relationships, networks and ties), financial capital (money 
in a bank, loans and credit), human capital (education and skills).

Carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2-equivalent or CO2e)
The universal unit of measurement used to indicate the global 
warming potential of the different greenhouse gases. Carbon 
dioxide – a naturally occurring gas that is a by-product of burning 
fossil fuels and biomass, land-use changes and other industrial 
processes – is the reference against which other greenhouse 
gases are measured.

Carbon sequestration
The process of increasing the carbon content of a reservoir other 
than the atmosphere.

Carbon stock
The quantity of carbon contained in a “pool”, meaning a reservoir 
or system which has the capacity to accumulate or release carbon.

Civil society
The aggregate of non-governmental organizations and 
institutions representing the interests and will of citizens.

Clean Development Mechanism (CDM)
The mechanism provided by Article 12 of the Kyoto Protocol, 
designed to assist developing countries achieve sustainable 
development by permitting industrialized countries to finance 
projects for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in developing 
countries and receive carbon credits for doing so.

Climate change
The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change defines climate 
change as “a change of climate which is attributed directly or 
indirectly to human activity that alters the composition of the 
global atmosphere and which is in addition to natural climate 
variability observed over comparable time periods.”

Climate proofing
A shorthand term for identifying risks to a development project, 
or any other specified natural or human asset, as a consequence 
of climate variability and change, and ensuring that those 
risks are reduced to acceptable levels through long-lasting 
and environmentally sound, economically viable, and socially 
acceptable changes implemented at one or more of the following 
stages in the project cycle: planning, design, construction, 
operation, and decommissioning. 

Climate variability
Variations in the mean state and other statistics (such as standard 
deviations and the occurrence of extremes) of the climate on all 
temporal and spatial scales beyond that of individual weather 
events. Variability may be due to natural internal processes in the 
climate system (internal variability), or to variations in natural or 
anthropogenic external forcing (external variability).

Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)
A group of chemicals, consisting of chlorine, fluorine and 
carbon, highly volatile and of low toxicity, widely used in the 
past as refrigerants, solvents, propellants and foaming agents. 
Chlorofluorocarbons have both ozone depletion and global 
warming potential.

Congener
A term in chemistry that refers to one of many variants or 
configurations of a common chemical structure. 

Conservation tillage
Breaking the soil surface without turning over the soil.

Catchment (area)
The area of land from which precipitation drains into a river, 
basin or reservoir. See also Drainage basin.

Consumptive water use
The use or removal of water from a water basin that renders it 
unavailable for further use.

Certified emission reductions (CERs)
Certification of greenhouse gas emission reductions issued 
pursuant to the Clean Development Mechanism of the Kyoto 
Protocol, and measured in tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent. 

Cross-cutting issue
An issue that cannot be adequately understood or explained 
without reference to the interactions of several of its dimensions 
that are usually defined separately.

Glossary 507

Crowd-sourcing
A problem-solving and production process that involves 
outsourcing tasks to a network of people, also known as the 
crowd. This process can occur both online and offline.

A synthetic organochlorine insecticide, one of the persistent 
organic pollutants listed for control under the Stockholm 
Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants.

Dead zone
A part of a water body so low in oxygen that normal life 
cannot survive. The low-oxygen conditions usually result from 
eutrophication caused by fertilizer run-off from land.

Deforestation
Conversion of forested land to non-forest areas.

Desertification
Land degradation in arid, semi-arid and dry sub-humid areas 
resulting from various factors, including climatic variations and 
human activities. It involves crossing thresholds beyond which 
the underpinning ecosystem cannot restore itself, but requires 
ever-greater external resources for recovery.

Disability-adjusted life years (DALYS)
The sum of years of potential life lost due to premature mortality 
and the years of productive life lost due to disability.

Disaster risk reduction
The conceptual framework of elements intended to minimize 
vulnerability to disasters throughout a society, to avoid (prevention) 
or limit (mitigation and preparedness) the adverse impacts of 
hazards, within the broad context of sustainable development.

Drainage basin (also called watershed, river basin or catchment)
Land area where precipitation runs off into streams, rivers, 
lakes and reservoirs. It is a land feature that can be identified 
by tracing a line along the highest elevations between different 
areas, often a ridge.

Driver 
The overarching socio-economic forces that exert pressures on 
the state of the environment.

Drylands

identified institutions, that allows individuals exposed to a 
hazard to take action to avoid or reduce their risk and prepare 
an effective response.

Earth System
The Earth System is a complex social-environmental system of 
interacting physical, chemical, biological and social components 
and processes that determine the state and evolution of the 
planet and life on it. 

Ecoagriculture
An approach to landscape management that simultaneously 
advances agricultural production, conservation of biodiversity 
and ecosystem services, and sustainable rural livelihoods.

Ecological footprint 
A measure of the area of biologically productive land and water 
an individual, population or activity uses to produce all the 
resources it consumes and to absorb the corresponding waste 
(such as carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel use), using 
prevailing technology and resource management practices. The 
ecological footprint is usually measured in global hectares.

Ecosystem
A dynamic complex of plant, animal and micro-organism 
communities and their non-living environment, interacting as 
a functional unit.

Ecosystem approach
A strategy for the integrated management of land, water and 
living resources that promotes conservation and sustainable 
use in an equitable way. An ecosystem approach is based on 
the application of appropriate scientific methods, focused on 
levels of biological organization that encompass the essential 
structure, processes, functions and interactions among and 
between organisms and their environment. It recognizes that 
humans, with their cultural diversity, are an integral component 
of many ecosystems.

Ecosystem function
An intrinsic ecosystem characteristic related to the set of 
conditions and processes whereby an ecosystem maintains 
its integrity (such as primary productivity, food chain and 
biogeochemical cycles). Ecosystem functions include such 
processes as decomposition, production, nutrient cycling, 
and movements of nutrients and energy.

Ecosystem health
The degree to which ecological factors and their interactions 
are reasonably complete and function for continued resilience, 
productivity and renewal of the ecosystem.

508

Glossary

Ecosystem management
An approach to maintaining or restoring the composition, 
structure, function and delivery of services of natural and 
modified ecosystems for the goal of achieving sustainability. 
It is based on an adaptive, collaboratively developed vision 
of desired future conditions that integrates ecological, socio-
economic, and institutional perspectives, applied within 
a geographic framework, and defined primarily by natural 
ecological boundaries.

Ecosystem resilience
The level of disturbance that an ecosystem can withstand without 
crossing a threshold to become a different structure or deliver 
different outputs. Resilience depends on ecological dynamics 
as well as human organizational and institutional capacity to 
understand, manage and respond to these dynamics.

Ecosystem services
The benefits of ecosystems. These include provisioning services, 
such as food and water regulating services, such as flood and 
disease control cultural services, such as spiritual, recreational 
and cultural benefits and supporting services, such as nutrient 
cycling, that maintain the conditions for life on Earth. Sometimes 
called ecosystem goods and services.

Ecotourism 
Travel undertaken to witness the natural or ecological quality of 
particular sites or regions, including the provision of eco-friendly 
services to facilitate such travel.

Effluent
In issues of water quality, refers to liquid waste (treated or 
untreated) discharged to the environment from sources such as 
industrial process and sewage treatment plants.

El Niño (also El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO))
In its original sense, it is a warm water current that periodically flows 
along the coast of Ecuador and Peru, disrupting the local fishery. 
This oceanic event is associated with a fluctuation of the inter-
tropical surface pressure pattern and circulation in the Indian and 
Pacific Oceans, called the Southern Oscillation. This atmosphere-
ocean phenomenon is collectively known as El Niño-Southern 
Oscillation, or ENSO. During an El Niño event, the prevailing trade 
winds weaken and the equatorial countercurrent strengthens, 
causing warm surface waters in the Indonesian area to flow eastward 
to overlie the cold waters of the Peru current off South America. This 
event has great impact on the wind, sea surface temperature and 
precipitation patterns in the tropical Pacific. It has climatic effects 
throughout the Pacific region and in many other parts of the world. 
The opposite of an El Niño event is called La Niña.

Emission inventory
Details the amounts and types of pollutants released into the 
environment.

Endangered species
A species is endangered when the best available evidence 
indicates that it meets any of the criteria A to E specified for 

the endangered category of the IUCN Red List, and is therefore 
considered to be facing a very high risk of extinction in the wild.

Endocrine disruptor
An external substance that interferes (through mimicking, 
blocking, inhibiting or stimulating) with function(s) of the 
hormonal system and consequently causes adverse health effects 
in an intact organism, or its progeny, or (sub) populations.

Energy intensity
Ratio of energy consumption to economic or physical output. At 
the national level, energy intensity is the ratio of total domestic 
primary energy consumption or final energy consumption to gross 
domestic product or physical output. Lower energy intensity 
shows greater efficiency in energy use.

Environmental education
The process of recognizing values and clarifying concepts in 
order to develop skills and attitudes necessary to understand 
and appreciate the interrelatedness of humans, their culture and 
biophysical surroundings. Environmental education also entails 
practice in decision-making and self-formulation of a code of 
behaviour about issues concerning environmental quality.

Environment statistics
Statistics that describe the state of and trends in the 
environment, covering the media of the natural environment (air/
climate, water, land/soil), the living organisms within the media, 
and human settlements.

Environmental assessment
The entire process of undertaking an objective evaluation and 
analysis of information designed to support environmental 
decision making. It applies the judgement of experts to 
existing knowledge to provide scientifically credible answers 
to policy -relevant questions, quantifying where possible the 
level of confidence. It reduces complexity but adds value by 
summarizing, synthesizing and building scenarios, and identifies 
consensus by sorting out what is known and widely accepted 
from what is not known or not agreed. It sensitizes the scientific 
community to policy needs and the policy community to the 
scientific basis for action.

Environmental flows
Quantity, timing and quality of water flows required to sustain 
freshwater and estuarine ecosystems and the human livelihoods 
and well-being that depend on these ecosystems. Through 
implementation of environmental flows, water managers strive 
to achieve a flow regime, or pattern, that provides for human 
uses and maintains the essential processes required to support 
healthy river ecosystems.

Environmental impact assessment (EIA) 
An analytical process or procedure that systematically 
examines the possible environmental consequences of a 
given activity or project. The aim is to ensure that the 
environmental implications are taken into account before 
the decisions are made. 

Glossary 509

Environmental health
Those aspects of human health and disease that are determined 
by factors in the environment. It also refers to the theory and 
practice of assessing and controlling factors in the environment 
that can potentially affect health. Environmental health includes 
both the direct pathological effects of chemicals, radiation 
and some biological agents, and the effects, often indirect, 
on health and well-being of the broad physical, psychological, 
social and aesthetic environment. This includes housing, urban 
development, land use and transport.

Environmental monitoring
Regular, comparable measurements or time series of data on 
the environment.

Environmental policy
A policy aimed at addressing environmental problems 
and challenges.

Equity
Fairness of rights, distribution and access. Depending on context, 
this can refer to access to resources, services or power.

Eutrophication
The degradation of water or land quality due to enrichment by 
nutrients, primarily nitrogen and phosphorous, which results in 
excessive plant (principally algae) growth and decay. Eutrophication 
of a lake normally contributes to its slow evolution into a bog or 
marsh and ultimately to dry land. Eutrophication may be accelerated 
by human activities that speed up the ageing process.

Evapotranspiration
Combined loss of water by evaporation from the soil or surface 
water, and transpiration from plants and animals.

E-waste (electronic waste)
A generic term encompassing various forms of electrical and 
electronic equipment that has ceased to be considered of value 
and is disposed of. 

External cost (also externality)
A cost that is not included in the market price of the goods and 
services produced. In other words, a cost not borne by those who 
create it, such as the cost of cleaning up contamination caused 
by discharge of pollution into the environment.

Feedback
Where non-linear change is driven by reactions that either 
dampen change (negative feedbacks) or reinforce change 
(positive feedbacks). 

Floods (river, flash and storm surge)
Usually classified into three types: river flood, flash flood and 
storm surge. River floods result from intense and/or persistent 
rain over large areas. Flash floods are mostly local events 
resulting from intense rainfall over a small area in a short period 
of time. Storm surge floods occur when floodwater from the 
ocean or large lakes is pushed on to land by winds or storms. 

Food security
Physical and economic access to food that meets people’s 
dietary needs as well as their food preferences.

Forest
Land spanning more than 0.5 hectares with trees higher than 5 
metres and a canopy cover of more than 10 per cent, or trees able 
to reach these thresholds in situ. It does not include land that is 
predominantly under agricultural or urban use.

Forest degradation
Changes within the forest that negatively affect the structure or 
function of the stand or site, and thereby lower the capacity to 
supply products and/or services.

Forest management
The processes of planning and implementing practices for the 
stewardship and use of forests and other wooded land aimed 
at achieving specific environmental, economic, social and/or 
cultural objectives.

Forest plantation
Forest stands established by planting and/or seeding in the 
process of afforestation or reforestation. They are either of 
introduced species (all planted stands), or intensively managed 
stands of indigenous species, which meet all the following criteria: 
contain one or two species, are of similar age and regularly spaced. 
“Planted forest” is another term used for plantation.

Fossil fuel
Coal, natural gas and petroleum products (such as oil) formed 
from the decayed bodies of animals and plants that died millions 
of years ago.

Fuel cell
A device that converts the energy of a chemical reaction directly 
into electrical energy. It produces electricity from external supplies 
of fuel (such as hydrogen) and oxidant (such as oxygen). A fuel 
cell can operate as long as the necessary flows are maintained. 
Fuel cells differ from batteries in that they consume reactant, 
which must be replenished, while batteries store electrical energy 
chemically in a closed system. One great advantage of fuel cells 
is that they generate electricity with very little pollution: much of 
the hydrogen and oxygen used in generating electricity ultimately 
combine to form water. Fuel cells are being developed as power 
sources for motor vehicles, as well as stationary power sources.

Genetic diversity
The variety of genes within a particular species, variety or breed.

Glossary

Global commons
Natural un-owned assets such as the atmosphere, oceans, outer 
space and the Antarctic.

Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS)
A network aiming to link existing and planned Earth observing 
systems (e.g., satellites and networks of weather stations and 
ocean buoys) around the world, support the development of 
new systems where gaps currently exist, and promote common 
technical standards so that data from the thousands of different 
instruments can be combined into coherent datasets. It aims to 
provide decision support tools to policy makers and other users 
in areas such as health, agriculture and disasters.

Global hectare
A hypothetical hectare with world-average ability to produce 
resources and absorb wastes. 

Global (international) environmental governance
The assemblage of laws and institutions that regulate society-
nature interactions and shape environmental outcomes.

Global observation system
A set of coordinated monitoring activities that would collect much 
needed data at a global scale on a variety of indicators such as 
biodiversity, water quality and quantity, atmospheric pollution, 
land degradation and chemical release.

Global public good
Public goods that have universal benefits, covering multiple 
groups of countries and all populations. 

Global warming
Increase in surface air temperature, referred to as the global 
temperature, induced by emissions of greenhouse gases into the air.

Globalization
The increasing integration of economies and societies around 
the world, particularly through trade and financial flows, and the 
transfer of culture and technology.

Governance
The act, process, or power of governing for the organization 
of society/ies. For example, there is governance through the 
state, the market, or through civil society groups and local 
organizations. Governance is exercised through institutions: 
laws, property-rights systems and forms of social organization.

Greenhouse effect
A process by which thermal radiation from a planetary surface is 
absorbed by atmospheric greenhouse gases, and is re-radiated 
in all directions. Since part of this re-radiation is back towards 
the surface and the lower atmosphere, it results in an elevation 
of the average surface temperature above what it would be in the 
absence of the gases.

Greenhouse gases (GHGs)
Gaseous constituents of the atmosphere, both natural and 

anthropogenic, that absorb and emit thermal radiation. This 
property causes the greenhouse effect. Water vapour (H2O), 
carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O), methane (CH4) and 
ozone (O3) are the primary greenhouse gases in the Earth’s 
atmosphere. There are human-made greenhouse gases in the 
atmosphere, such as halocarbons and other chlorine- and 
bromine-containing substances. Beside CO2, N2O and CH4, 
the Kyoto Protocol deals with sulphur hexafluoride (SF6), 
hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and nitrogen 
trifluoride (NF3).

Green water
The precipitation on land that does not run off or recharge the 
groundwater but is stored in the soil or temporarily stays on top 
of the soil or vegetation. Eventually, this part of precipitation 
evaporates or transpires through plants. The green water 
footprint is the volume of rainwater consumed during the 
production process. This is particularly relevant for agricultural 
and forestry products (products based on crops or wood), where 
it refers to the total rainwater evapotranspiration (from fields 
and plantations) plus the water incorporated into the harvested 
crop or wood.

Grey water 
Water the quality of which has been adversely affected by human 
use, in industrial, agriculture or domestically. The grey water 
footprint of a product is an indicator of freshwater pollution that 
can be associated with the production of a product over its full 
supply chain. It is defined as the volume of freshwater that is 
required to assimilate the load of pollutants based on natural 
background concentrations and existing ambient water quality 
standards. It is calculated as the volume of water that is required 
to dilute pollutants to such an extent that the quality of the water 
remains above agreed water quality standards.

Gross domestic product (GDP)
The value of all final goods and services produced in a country in 
one year. GDP can be measured by adding up all of an economy’s 
incomes – wages, interest, profits, and rents – or expenditures 
– consumption, investment, government purchases, and net 
exports (exports minus imports).

Ground-truthing
A process by which the content of satellite images, aerial 
photographs – or maps based on them – is compared with the 
reality on the ground through site visits and field surveys. It is 
used to verify the accuracy of the images or the way they have 
been interpreted to produce maps.

Groundwater 
Water that flows or seeps downward and saturates soil or rock, 
supplying springs and wells. The upper surface of the saturate 
zone is called the water table. 

Gyres 
A large system of rotating ocean currents, primarily driven by 
wind movement. Large gyres exist in the Indian Ocean, North 
Atlantic, North Pacific, South Atlantic and South Pacific. 

Glossary 511

lakes and rivers), groundwater (water in soil and beneath 
the Earth’s surface), snow, ice and water in the atmosphere, 
including water vapour.

Habitat fragmentation 
Alteration of habitat resulting in spatial separation of habitat 
units from a previous state of greater continuity.

Hard law
Legally binding obligations that are precise (or can be made 
precise through adjudication or the issuance of detailed 
regulations) and that delegate authority for interpreting and 
implementing the law. In the context of international law, hard law 
refers to treaties or international agreements, as well as customary 
laws. These documents create enforceable obligations and rights 
for states and other international entities. See also Soft law.

Hazard
A potentially damaging physical event, phenomenon or human 
activity that may cause the loss of life or injury, property damage, 
social and economic disruption or environmental degradation. 

Hypoxia
Lack of oxygen. In the context of eutrophication and algal 
blooms, hypoxia is the result of a process that uses up dissolved 
oxygen in the water. Algal blooms cause water to become more 
opaque, thereby reducing light availability to submerged aquatic 
vegetation, and interfering with beneficial human water uses. 
When the bloom dies off, algae sink to the bottom and are 
decomposed by bacteria using up the available oxygen. Hypoxia 
is particularly severe in the late summer, and can be so severe 
in some areas that they are referred to as “dead zones” because 
only bacteria can survive there. 

Improved drinking water

The oceans outside national jurisdictions, lying beyond each 
nation’s exclusive economic zone or other territorial waters. 

Human well-being 
The extent to which individuals have the ability to live the kinds 
of lives they have reason to value; the opportunities people 
have to pursue their aspirations. Basic components of human 
well-being include: security, meeting material needs, health and 
social relations. 

Hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) 
Organic and human-made substances composed of hydrogen, 
chlorine, fluorine and carbon atoms. As the ozone-depleting 
potential of HCFCs is much lower than that of CFCs, HCFCs were 
considered acceptable interim substitutes for CFCs. 

Hydrological cycle 
Succession of stages undergone by water in its passage from 
the atmosphere to the Earth’s surface and its return to the 
atmosphere. The stages include evaporation from land, sea 
or inland water, condensation to form clouds, precipitation,

management of water, land and related resources, in order 
to maximize the resultant economic and social welfare in an 
equitable manner without compromising the sustainability of 
vital ecosystems. 

Institutions

itself: the rules, practices and conventions that structure human 
interaction. The term is wide and encompassing, and could be 
taken to include law, social relationships, property rights and 
tenurial systems, norms, beliefs, customs and codes of conduct 
as much as multilateral environmental agreements, international 
conventions and financing mechanisms. Institutions could be formal 
(explicit, written, often having the sanction of the state) or informal 
(unwritten, implied, tacit, mutually agreed and accepted). Formal 
institutions include law, international environmental agreements, 
bylaws and memoranda of understanding. Informal institutions 
include unwritten rules, codes of conduct and value systems. The 
term “institutions” should be distinguished from organizations.

of force causes a small change in system behaviour, or a high 
leverage point if a small amount of force causes a large change.

Kuznets curve (environmental)
A relationship between economic development and environmental 
pollution. Based on empirical evidence, some forms of local pollution 
(airborne lead, sulphur) declined significantly in industrialized 
countries despite robust economic growth. This follows a general 
pattern of poor countries being relatively unpolluted, middle-income 
countries more polluted, and rich countries clean again. 

Kyoto Protocol
A protocol to the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention 
on Climate Change (UNFCCC) adopted at the Third Session of the 
Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC in 1997 in Kyoto, Japan. It 
contains legally binding commitments in addition to those included 
in the UNFCCC. Countries included in Annex B of the protocol (most 
OECD countries and countries with economies in transition) agreed 
to control their national anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse 
gases (CO2, CH4, N2O, HFCs, PFCs, SF6 and NF3) so that the total 
emissions from these countries would be at least 5 per cent below

programmes and evaluate the links with economic and social 
considerations. An SEA is undertaken for plans, programmes  
and policies. It helps decision makers reach a better 
understanding of how environmental, social and economic 
considerations fit together. 

Stratospheric ozone depletion
Chemical destruction of the stratospheric ozone layer, 
particularly by substances produced by human activities.

Structural adjustment
A process of market-oriented economic reform aimed at reducing 
inflation and creating conditions for economic growth. 

Supporting services
Ecosystem services that are necessary for the production of all other 
ecosystem services. Some examples include biomass production, 
production of atmospheric oxygen, soil formation and retention, 
nutrient cycling, water cycling and provisioning of habitat.

Surface water
All water naturally open to the atmosphere, including rivers, 
lakes, reservoirs, streams, impoundments, seas and estuaries. 
The term also covers springs, wells or other collectors of water 
that are directly influenced by surface waters.

Sustainability
A characteristic or state whereby the needs of the present 
population can be met without compromising the ability of future 
generations or populations in other locations to meet their needs.

Sustainable agriculture and livestock production
Management of agricultural and livestock resources to satisfy 
human needs while maintaining or enhancing environmental 
quality and conserving natural resources for future generations.

Sustainable development
Development that meets the needs of the present generation 
without compromising the ability of future generations to meet 
their own needs.

Sustainable forest management (SFM)
The stewardship and use of forests and forest lands in a way, 
and at a rate, that maintains their biodiversity, productivity, 
regeneration capacity, vitality and potential to fulfill, now and in 
the future, relevant ecological, economic and social functions, 
at local, national and global levels, and that does not cause 
damage to other ecosystems.

Synergies
These arise when two or more processes, organizations, 
substances or other agents interact in such a way that the 
outcome is greater than the sum of their separate effects. 

System
A system is a collection of component parts that interact with one 
another within some boundary. 

Taxonomy
A system of nested categories (taxa) reflecting evolutionary 
relationships or morphological similarities.

TechnoGarden
The TechnoGarden scenario depicts a globally connected world 
relying strongly on technology and highly managed, often 
engineered ecosystems, to deliver ecosystem services.

Technology
Physical artefacts or the bodies of knowledge of which they 
are an expression. Examples are water extraction structures, 
such as tube wells, renewable energy technologies and 
traditional knowledge. Technology and institutions are related. 
Any technology has a set of practices, rules and regulations 
surrounding its use, access, distribution and management.

Technology effect
Reducing the net or at least per-person impact of resource 
consumption due to technological innovations. 

Technology transfer
A broad set of processes covering the flows of know-how, 
experience and equipment among different stakeholders.

Temperate region
The region in which the climate undergoes seasonal change in 
temperature and moisture. Temperate regions of the Earth lie 
primarily between 30° and 60° latitude in both hemispheres.

Thermohaline circulation (THC)
Large-scale density-driven circulation in the ocean, caused by 
differences in temperature and salinity. In the North Atlantic, the 
thermohaline circulation consists of warm surface water flowing 
northward and cold deep water flowing southward, resulting 
in a net poleward transport of heat. The surface water sinks in 
highly restricted sinking regions located in high latitudes. Also 
referred to as the (global) ocean conveyer belt or the meridional 
overturning circulation (MOC).

Threshold
The level of magnitude of a system process at which sudden or rapid 
change occurs. A point or level at which new properties emerge in 
an ecological, economic or other system, invalidating predictions 
based on mathematical relationships that apply at lower levels.

Symbiotic relationship
A relationship between two different organisms living in close 
physical association, typically to the advantage of both

Tipping point
The critical point in an evolving situation that leads to a new and 
sometimes irreversible development.

Glossary

Tokenism
The policy or practice of making only a symbolic effort.

Topography
The study or detailed description of the surface features of a region.

Toxic pollutants
Pollutants that cause death, disease or birth defects in 
organisms that ingest or absorb them. 

Traditional or local ecological knowledge
A cumulative body of knowledge, know-how, practices or 
representations maintained or developed by peoples with 
extended histories of interaction with the natural environment.

Transformation
State of being transformed. In the context of GEO-5, 
transformation refers to a series of actions that explores 
opportunities to stop doing the things that pull the Earth System 
in the wrong direction and at the same time provide resources, 
capacity and an enabling environment for all that is consistent 
with the sustainable-world vision.

Transitions 
Non-linear, systematic and fundamental changes of the 
composition and functioning of a societal system with changes 
in structures, cultures and practices.

Transpiration
The loss of water vapour from parts of plants, especially in leaves 
but also in stems, flowers and roots.

Trillion
1012 (1 000 000 000 000)

Trophic level
Successive stages of nourishment as represented by the links of 
the food chain. Put simply, the primary producers (phytoplankton) 
constitute the first trophic level, herbivorous zooplankton the second 
and carnivorous organisms the third trophic level.

Tropospheric ozone
Ozone at the bottom of the atmosphere, and the level at which 
humans, crops and ecosystems are exposed. Also known as 
ground-level ozone.

Urban sprawl
The decentralization of the urban core through the unlimited 
outward extension of dispersed development beyond the 
urban fringe, where low density residential and commercial 
development exacerbates fragmentation of powers over land use.

Urbanization
An increase in the proportion of the population living in urban areas.

Virtual water trade
The idea that when goods and services are traded, the water 
needed to produce them (embedded) is traded as well.

Vulnerability
An intrinsic feature of people at risk. It is a function of exposure, 
sensitivity to impacts of the specific unit exposed (such as a 
watershed, island, household, village, city or country), and the ability 
or inability to cope or adapt. It is multi-dimensional, multi-disciplinary, 
multi-sectoral and dynamic. The exposure is to hazards such as 
drought, conflict or extreme price fluctuations, and also to underlying 
socio-economic, institutional and environmental conditions.

Wastewater treatment
Any of the mechanical, biological or chemical processes used to 
modify the quality of wastewater in order to reduce pollution levels.

Water conflict
A confrontation between countries, states, or groups over water 
resources.

Water footprint
An indicator of water use that looks at both direct and indirect 
water use of a consumer or producer. The water footprint of an 
individual, community, nation or business is defined as the total 
volume of freshwater that is used to produce the goods and 
services consumed by the individual, community or nation, or 
produced by the business.

Water quality
The chemical, physical and biological characteristics of water, 
usually in respect to its suitability for a particular purpose.

Water scarcity
Occurs when annual water supplies drop below 1 000 m3 per 
person, or when more than 40 per cent of available water is used.

Water security
A term that broadly refers to the sustainable use and protection 
of water systems, the protection against water related hazards 
(floods and droughts), the sustainable development of water 
resources and the safeguarding of (access to) water functions 
and services for humans and the environment.

Water stress
Occurs when low water supplies limit food production and economic 
development, and affect human health. An area is experiencing water 
stress when annual water supplies drop below 1 700 m3 per person.

Wetland
Area of marsh, fen, peatland, bog or water, whether natural or 
artificial, permanent or temporary, with water that is static or 
flowing, fresh, brackish or salt, including areas of marine water to 
a depth, at low tide, that does not exceed 6 metres.

Woodland
Wooded land, which is not classified as forest, spanning more 
than 0.5 hectares, with trees higher than 5 metres and a canopy 
cover of 5–10 per cent, or trees able to reach these thresholds in 
situ, or with a combined cover of shrubs, bushes and trees above 
10 per cent. It does not include areas used predominantly for 
agricultural or urban purposes.
