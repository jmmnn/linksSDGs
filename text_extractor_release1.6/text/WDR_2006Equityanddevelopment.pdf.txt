Foreword

Poverty reduction comes about through individuals, families and communities taking advan-
tage of the opportunities available to them by working, investing and innovating to better their
lives. But we live in a world of extraordinary inequalities in opportunity, both within and across
countries. Even the basic opportunity for life itself is disparately distributed: whereas less than
half of one percent of children born in Sweden die before their ﬁrst birthday, this is the case for
close to 15% of all children born in Mozambique. Within El Salvador, the infant mortality rate
is 2% for children of educated mothers, but 10% for those whose mothers have no schooling.
In Eritrea, immunization coverage is close to 100% for children in the richest ﬁfth of the popu-
lation, but only 50% for the bottom ﬁfth.

These children can not be blamed for the circumstances into which they are born, yet their
lives—and  their  ability  to  contribute  to  the  development  of their  nations—are  powerfully
shaped by them. That is why the World Development Report 2006, the twenty-eighth in this
annual series, looks at the role of equity in the process of development. Equity is deﬁned in
terms of two basic principles. The ﬁrst is equal opportunities: that a person’s life achievements
should be determined primarily by his or her talents and efforts, rather than by pre-determined
circumstances such as race, gender, social or family background. The second principle is the
avoidance of deprivation in outcomes, particularly in health, education and consumption levels.
For many if not most people, equity is of intrinsic importance as a development goal in its
own right. But this report goes further, by presenting persuasive evidence that a broad sharing
of economic and political opportunities is also instrumental for economic growth and devel-
opment. This is for economic reasons, because greater equity can lead to a fuller and more efﬁ-
cient  use  of a  nation’s  resources. It  is  also  for  political  and  institutional  reasons: excessive
inequalities in power and inﬂuence can lead to political, social and economic institutions that
are less conducive to long-term growth. Few today’s prosperous societies, if any, developed by
excluding the majority of their people from economic and political opportunities.

The implication of this message for the work of the World Bank and others in the develop-
ment community is that a focus on equity should be a central concern in the design and imple-
mentation of policy for development and growth. This insight needs to be integrated into both
analytical and operational work on core areas of development design, including the role and
functioning of markets. Public action should seek to expand the opportunity sets of those who,
in the absence of policy interventions, have the least resources, voice and capabilities. It should
do so in a manner that respects and enhances individual freedoms, as well as the role of markets
in allocating resources.

Equity in the international arena is also a central concern, and can play a powerful comple-
mentary role to domestic action. In a globally interconnected world, leveling the international
playing ﬁelds, both economically and politically, will help domestic efforts to combine equity
with efﬁciency and growth.

In my view, the evidence that equity and economic efﬁciency as well as growth are comple-
mentary  in  the  long  run  helps  to  integrate  the  main  two  components  of the World  Bank’s
poverty reduction strategy. The focus on broadening opportunities strongly supports the ﬁrst

xi

WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2005

pillar of the Bank’s development strategy, namely enhancing the investment climate for every-
one. Together  with  the  interdependence  between  the  economic  and  political  dimensions  of
development it also reinforces the importance of empowerment. This report shows that the
two pillars are not independent from each other in supporting development, but instead are
intricately linked with one another. It is my hope that this report will have a real inﬂuence in the
way that we and our development partners understand, design and implement development
policies.

Extensive and excellent advice was received from Anthony B. Atkinson, Angus Deaton, Naila
Kabeer, Martin Ravallion, and Amartya Sen, to whom the team is grateful without implication.
Many others inside and outside the World Bank also provided helpful comments; their names
are listed in the Bibliographical Note. The Development Data Group contributed to the data
appendix and was responsible for the Selected World Development Indicators. Much of the
background research was supported by a multidonor programmatic trust fund, the Knowledge
for Change Program, funded by Canada, the European Community, Finland, Norway, Sweden,
Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.

The team undertook a wide range of consultations for this Report, which included work-
shops  in  Amsterdam, Beirut, Berlin, Cairo, Dakar, Geneva, Helsinki, Hyderabad, London,
Milan, Nairobi, New Delhi, Oslo, Ottawa, Paris, Rio de Janeiro, Stockholm, Tokyo, Venice, and
Washington, D.C.; videoconferences  with  sites  in  Bogota, Buenos  Aires, Mexico  City, and
Tokyo; and an on-line discussion of the draft Report. The team wishes to thank participants in
these workshops, videoconferences, and discussions, which included researchers, government
ofﬁcials, and staff of nongovernmental and private-sector organizations.

Rebecca Sugui served as executive assistant to the team, Ofelia Valladolid as program assis-
tant, Madhur Arora and Jason Victor as team assistants. Evangeline Santo Domingo served as
resource management assistant.

Data notes
The countries included in regional and income groupings in
this Report are listed in the Classiﬁcation of Economies table
at the beginning of the Selected World Development Indica-
tors. Income  classiﬁcations  are  based  on  GNP  per  capita;
thresholds for income classiﬁcations in this edition may be
found  in  the  Introduction  to  Selected  World  Development
Indicators. Group averages reported in the ﬁgures and tables
are unweighted averages of the countries in the group, unless
noted to the contrary.

The use of the word countries to refer to economies implies
no judgment by the World Bank about the legal or other status
of a territory. The term developing countries includes low- and
middle-income economies and thus may include economies in
transition from central planning, as a matter of convenience.
The term advanced countries may be used as a matter of conve-
nience to denote high-income economies.

Dollar  ﬁgures  are  current  U.S. dollars, unless  otherwise
speciﬁed. Billion means 1,000 million; trillion means 1,000 bil-
lion.

Overview

Consider two South African children born on
the  same  day  in  2000. Nthabiseng  is  black,
born to a poor family in a rural area in the
Eastern Cape province, about 700 kilometers
from Cape Town. Her mother had no formal
schooling. Pieter is white, born to a wealthy
family in Cape Town. His mother completed
a college education at the nearby prestigious

On the day of their birth, Nthabiseng and
Pieter  could  hardly  be  held  responsible  for
their family circumstances: their race, their
parents’ income and education, their urban
or  rural  location, or  indeed  their  sex. Yet
statistics  suggest  that  those  predetermined
background variables will make a major dif-
ference  for  the  lives  they  lead. Nthabiseng
has a 7.2 percent chance of dying in the ﬁrst
year  of her  life, more  than  twice  Pieter’s  3
percent. Pieter can look forward to 68 years
of life, Nthabiseng to 50. Pieter can expect to
complete  12  years  of
formal  schooling,
Nthabiseng less than 1 year.1 Nthabiseng is
likely to be considerably poorer than Pieter
throughout her life.2 Growing up, she is less
likely to have access to clean water and sani-
tation, or to good schools. So the opportuni-
ties these two children face to reach their full
human  potential  are  vastly  different  from
the outset, through no fault of their own.

Such disparities in opportunity translate
into  different  abilities  to  contribute  to
South  Africa’s  development. Nthabiseng’s
health at birth may have been poorer, owing
to the poorer nutrition of her mother dur-
ing her pregnancy. By virtue of their gender
socialization, their geographic location, and
their access to schools, Pieter is much more
likely  to  acquire  an  education  that  will
enable him to put his innate talents to full
use. Even if at age 25, and despite the odds,
Nthabiseng  manages  to  come  up  with  a

great  business  idea  (such  as  an  innovation
to  increase  agricultural  production), she
would  ﬁnd  it  much  harder  to  persuade  a
bank  to  lend  her  money  at  a  reasonable
interest  rate. Pieter, having  a  similarly
bright  idea  (say, on  how  to  design  an
improved  version  of promising  software),
would  likely  ﬁnd  it  easier  to  obtain  credit,
with both a college diploma and quite pos-
sibly some collateral. With the transition to
democracy  in  South  Africa, Nthabiseng  is
able  to  vote  and  thus  indirectly  shape  the
policy  of her  government,
something
denied  to  blacks  under  apartheid. But  the
legacy of apartheid’s unequal opportunities
and  political  power  will  remain  for  some
time to come. It is a long road from such a
(fundamental)  political  change  to  changes
in economic and social conditions.

As  striking  as  the  differences  in  life
chances are between Pieter and Nthabiseng
in  South  Africa, they  are  dwarfed  by  the
disparities between average South Africans
and  citizens  of more  developed  countries.
Consider the cards dealt to Sven—born on
that  same  day  to  an  average  Swedish
household. His  chances  of dying  in  the
first year of life are very small (0.3 percent)
and he can expect to live to the age of 80, 12
years longer than Pieter, and 30 years more
than  Nthabiseng. He  is  likely  to  complete
11.4 years of schooling—5 years more than
the average South African. These differences
in  the  quantity  of schooling  are  com-
pounded  by  differences  in  quality: in  the
eighth  grade, Sven  can  expect  to  obtain  a
score of 500 on an internationally compara-
ble  math  test, while  the  average  South
African  student  will  get  a  score  of only
264—more  than  two  standard  deviations
below  the  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-
operation and Development (OECD) median.

Nthabiseng most likely will never reach that
grade and so will not take the test.3

These  differences  in  life  chances  across
nationality, race, gender, and  social  groups
will  strike  many  readers  as  fundamentally
unfair. They are also likely to lead to wasted
human potential and thus to missed devel-
opment  opportunities. That  is  why  World
Development Report 2006 analyzes the rela-
tionship between equity and development.

By  equity  we  mean  that  individuals
should have equal opportunities to pursue a
life  of their  choosing  and  be  spared  from
extreme deprivation in outcomes. The main
message is that equity is complementary, in
some  fundamental  respects, to  the  pursuit
of long-term  prosperity. Institutions  and
policies that promote a level playing ﬁeld—
where  all  members  of society  have  similar
chances to become socially active, politically
inﬂuential, and economically productive—
contribute to sustainable growth and devel-
opment. Greater equity is thus doubly good
for  poverty  reduction: through  potential
beneﬁcial  effects  on  aggregate  long-run
development and through greater opportu-
nities for poorer groups within any society.
The  complementarities  between  equity
and  prosperity  arise  for  two  broad  sets  of
reasons. First, there  are  many  market  fail-
ures in developing countries, notably in the
markets  for  credit,
land, and
human  capital. As  a  result, resources  may
not  ﬂow  where  returns  are  highest. For
example, some highly capable children, like
Nthabiseng, may  fail  to  complete  primary
schooling, while  others, who  are  less  able,
may  ﬁnish  university. Farmers  may  work
harder  on  plots  they  own  than  on  those
they  sharecrop. Some  efﬁcient  developing-
country  producers  of agricultural  com-
modities  and  textiles  are  shut  out  of some
OECD markets, and poor unskilled workers
have  highly  restricted  opportunities  to
migrate to work in richer countries.

insurance,

When markets are missing or imperfect,
the distributions of wealth and power affect
the allocation of investment opportunities.
Correcting  the  market  failures  is  the  ideal
response; where  this  is  not  feasible, or  far
too  costly, some  forms  of redistribution—
of access  to  services, assets, or  political
inﬂuence—can increase economic efﬁciency.

The second set of reasons why equity and
long-term prosperity can be complementary
arises  from  the  fact  that  high  levels  of
economic  and  political  inequality  tend  to
lead  to  economic  institutions  and  social
arrangements  that  systematically  favor  the
interests of those with more inﬂuence. Such
inequitable  institutions  can  generate  eco-
nomic  costs. When  personal  and  property
rights  are  enforced  only  selectively, when
budgetary  allocations  beneﬁt  mainly  the
politically  inﬂuential, and  when  the  distri-
bution of public services favors the wealthy,
both middle and poorer groups end up with
unexploited  talent. Society, as  a  whole, is
then likely to be more inefﬁcient and to miss
out  on  opportunities  for  innovation  and
investment. At the global level, when devel-
oping  countries  have  little  or  no  voice  in
global governance, the rules can be inappro-
priate and costly for poorer countries.

These adverse effects of unequal opportu-
nities and political power on development are
all  the  more  damaging  because  economic,
political, and social inequalities tend to repro-
duce themselves over time and across genera-
tions. We  call  such  phenomena  “inequality
traps.” Disadvantaged children from families
at  the  bottom  of the  wealth  distribution  do
not have the same opportunities as children
from  wealthier  families  to  receive  quality
education. So  these  disadvantaged  children
can expect to earn less as adults. Because the
poor have less voice in the political process,
they—like their parents—will be less able to
inﬂuence  spending  decisions  to  improve
public  schools  for  their  children. And  the
cycle of underachievement continues.

The distribution of wealth is closely corre-
lated with social distinctions that stratify peo-
ple, communities, and  nations  into  groups
that dominate and those that are dominated.
These patterns of domination persist because
economic  and  social  differences  are  rein-
forced by the overt and covert use of power.
Elites protect their interests in subtle ways, by
exclusionary  practices  in  marriage  and  kin-
ship  systems, for  instance, and  in  ways  that
are  less  subtle, such  as  aggressive  political
manipulation or the explicit use of violence.
Such overlapping political, social, cultural,
and  economic  inequalities  stiﬂe  mobility.
They  are  hard  to  break  because  they  are  so

closely  tied  to  the  ordinary  business  of life.
They are perpetuated by the elite, and often
internalized by the marginalized or oppressed
groups, making  it  difﬁcult  for  the  poor  to
ﬁnd their way out of poverty. Inequality traps
can  thus  be  rather  stable, tending  to  persist
over generations.

The report documents the persistence of
these  inequality  traps  by  highlighting  the
interaction  between  different  forms  of in-
equality. It presents evidence that the inequal-
ity of opportunity that arises is wasteful and
inimical  to  sustainable  development  and
poverty  reduction. It  also  derives  policy
implications that center on the broad concept
of leveling the playing ﬁeld—both politically
and  economically  and  in  the  domestic  and
the  global  arenas. If the  opportunities  faced
by  children  like  Nthabiseng  are  so  much
more limited than those faced by children like
Pieter or Sven, and if this hurts development
progress in the aggregate, then public action
has a legitimate role in seeking to broaden the
opportunities  of those  who  face  the  most
limited choices.

Three  considerations  are  important  at
the  outset. First, while  more  even  playing
ﬁelds  are  likely  to  lead  to  lower  observed
inequalities 
in  educational  attainment,
health status, and incomes, the policy aim is
not equality in outcomes. Indeed, even with
genuine equality of opportunities, one would
always expect to observe some differences in
outcomes owing to differences in preferences,
talents, effort, and  luck.4 This  is  consistent
with the important role of income differences
in providing incentives to invest in education
and  physical  capital, to  work, and  to  take
risks. Of course outcomes matter, but we are
concerned with them mainly for their inﬂu-
ence on absolute deprivation and their role in
shaping opportunities.

Second, a concern with equality of oppor-
tunity implies that public action should focus
on  the  distributions  of assets, economic
opportunities, and political voice, rather than
directly on inequality in incomes. Policies can
contribute  to  the  move  from  an “inequality
trap” to a virtuous circle of equity and growth
by leveling the playing ﬁeld—through greater
investment  in  the  human  resources  of the
poorest; greater  and  more  equal  access  to
public  services  and  information; guarantees

on  property  rights  for  all; and  greater  fair-
ness in markets. But policies to level the eco-
nomic  playing  ﬁeld  face  big  challenges.
There  is  unequal  capacity  to  inﬂuence  the
policy agenda: the interests of the disenfran-
chised may never be voiced or represented.
And  when  policies  challenge  privileges,
powerful groups may seek to block reforms.
Thus, equitable policies are more likely to be
successful when leveling the economic play-
ing ﬁeld is accompanied by similar efforts to
level the domestic political playing ﬁeld and
introduce  greater  fairness  in  global  gover-
nance.

Third, there  may  be  various  short-run,
policy-level tradeoffs between equity and efﬁ-
ciency. These are well recognized and exten-
sively  documented. The  point  is  that  the
(often  implicit)  cost-beneﬁt  calculus  that
policymakers use to assess the merits of vari-
ous policies too often ignores the long-term,
hard-to-measure but real beneﬁts of greater
equity. Greater equity implies more efﬁcient
economic  functioning,
reduced  conﬂict,
greater  trust, and  better  institutions, with
dynamic beneﬁts for investment and growth.
To the extent that such beneﬁts are ignored,
policymakers may end up choosing too little
equity.

By the same token, however, those inter-
ested in greater equity must not ignore the
short-term  tradeoffs. If individual  incen-
tives  are  blunted  by  income  redistribution
schemes  that  tax  investment  and  produc-
tion too steeply, the result will be less inno-
vation, less  investment, and  less  growth.
The history of the twentieth century is lit-
tered with examples of ill-designed policies
pursued in the name of equity that seriously
harmed—rather 
spurred—growth
processes by ignoring individual incentives.
A  balance  must  be  sought, taking  into
account  both  the  immediate  costs  to  indi-
vidual incentives and the long-term beneﬁts
of cohesive societies, with inclusive institu-
tions and broad opportunities.

than 

While careful assessment of policy design
in local contexts is always important, equity
considerations  need  to  be  brought  squarely
into the center of both diagnosis and policy.
This is not intended as a new framework. It
means  integrating  and  extending  existing
frameworks: equity  is  central  both  to  the

investment environment and to the agenda
of empowerment, working  through  the
impact  on  institutions  and  speciﬁc  policy
designs. Some may value equity for its own
sake, others  primarily  for  its  instrumental
role in reducing absolute poverty, the World
Bank’s mission.

This report recognizes the intrinsic value
of equity  but  aims  primarily  to  document
how a focus on equity matters for long-run
development. It has three parts.

• Part I considers the evidence on inequal-
ity  of opportunity, within  and  across
countries. Some  attempts  to  quantify
inequality  of opportunity  are  reviewed
but, more generally, we rely on evidence
of highly  unequal  outcomes  across
groups  deﬁned  by  predetermined  cir-
cumstances—such as gender, race, fam-
ily background, or country of birth—as
markers for unequal opportunities.

• Part  II  asks  why  equity  matters. It  dis-
cusses  the  two  channels  of impact  (the
effects  of unequal  opportunities  when
markets  are  imperfect, and  the  conse-
quences  of inequity  for  the  quality  of
institutions a society develops) as well as
intrinsic motives.

• Part III asks how public action can level
the political and economic playing ﬁelds.
In the domestic arena, it makes the case
for investing in people, expanding access
to  justice, land, and  infrastructure, and
promoting  fairness  in  markets. In  the
international arena, it considers leveling
the  playing  ﬁeld  in  the  functioning  of
global markets and the rules that govern
them—and  the  complementary  provi-
sion  of aid  to  help  poor  countries  and
poor people build greater endowments.

The remainder of this overview provides a
summary of the principal ﬁndings.

Inequity within 
and across nations
From  an  equity  perspective, the  distribu-
tion  of opportunities  matters  more  than
the distribution of outcomes. But opportu-
nities, which  are  potentials  rather  than
actuals, are harder to observe and measure
than outcomes.

Within-country inequities 
have many dimensions
Direct  quantiﬁcation  of
inequality  of
opportunity is difﬁcult, but one analysis of
Brazil  provides  an  illustration  (chapter  2).
Earnings  inequality  in  1996  was  divided
into one share attributable to four predeter-
mined  circumstances  that  lie  beyond  the
control  of
individuals—race, region  of
birth, parental  education, and  paternal
occupation  at  birth—and  a  residual  share.
These 
for
around one-quarter of overall differences in
earnings  between  workers. Arguably, other
determinants  of opportunity  are  equally
predetermined at birth but not included in
this  set—for  example, gender,
family
wealth, or  the  quality  of primary  schools.
Because such variables are not included in
the  inequality “decomposition,” the  results
here can be seen as lower-bound estimates
of inequality of opportunity in Brazil.

four  circumstances  account 

Unfortunately, predetermined (and thus
morally  irrelevant)  circumstances  deter-
mine much more than just future earnings.
Education and health are of intrinsic value
and  affect  the  capacity  of individuals  to
engage  in  economic, social, and  political
life. Yet children face substantially different
opportunities  to  learn  and  to  lead  healthy
lives  in  almost  all  populations, depending
on asset ownership, geographic location, or
parental education, among others. Consider
how access to a basic package of immuniza-
tion  services  differs  for  the  rich  and  the
poor across countries (ﬁgure 1).

There  is  substantial  inequality  in  access
between, for  example, Egypt, where  almost
everyone is covered (on the left), and Chad,
where more than 40 percent of children are
excluded  (on  the  right). Yet  the  disparities
can be as large within some countries as they
are  across  all  nations  in  the  sample. In
Eritrea, for  instance, the  richest  ﬁfth  enjoys
almost complete coverage, but almost half of
all children in the poorest ﬁfth are excluded.
Signiﬁcant  gender  differences  also  per-
sist in many parts of the world. In parts of
East and South Asia, notably in certain areas
in  rural  China  and  northwest  India, the
opportunity to life itself can depend on one
single  predetermined  characteristic: sex.
These  regions  have  signiﬁcantly  more  boy

infants  than  girls, in  part  because  of sex-
selective abortion and differential care after
birth. And in many (though not all) parts of
the  world, more  boys  than  girls  attend
school. The  hundreds  of millions  of dis-
abled children across the developing world
also  face  very  different  opportunities  than
their able-bodied peers.

These  inequities  are  usually  associated
with differences in an individual’s “agency”—
the socioeconomically, culturally, and polit-
ically determined ability to shape the world
around  oneself. Such  differences  create
biases in the institutions and rules in favor
of more  powerful  and  privileged  groups.
This is seen in realities as diverse as the low
chances for mobility of scheduled castes in
a  village  in  rural  India  and  the  frequent
episodes  of discrimination  against  the
Quichua people in Ecuador. Persistent dif-
ferences  in  power  and  status  between

groups can become internalized into behav-
iors, aspirations, and  preferences  that  also
perpetuate inequalities.

Inequalities  of opportunity  are  also
transmitted  across  generations. The  chil-
dren  of poorer  and  lower-status  parents
face  inferior  chances  in  education, health,
incomes, and  status. This  starts  early. In
Ecuador, three-year-old  children  from  all
socioeconomic  groups  have  similar  test
scores  for  vocabulary  recognition  and  are
close  to  a  standard  international  reference
population. But by the time they are ﬁve, all
have  faltered  relative  to  the  international
reference  group, except  for  those  in  the
richest groups and with the highest levels of
parental  education  (ﬁgure  2). Such  pro-
nounced differences in vocabulary recogni-
tion between children whose parents had 0
to  5  years  of schooling  and  those  whose
parents  had  12  or  more  years  are  likely  to

carry  over  to  their  performance  once  they
enter primary school, and will likely persist
thereafter. Intergenerational  immobility  is
also  observed  in  rich  countries: new  evi-
dence  from  the  United  States  (where  the
myth of equal opportunity is strong) ﬁnds
high levels of persistence of socioeconomic
status  across  generations: recent  estimates
suggest  that  it  would  take  ﬁve  generations
for  a  family  that  earned  half the  national
average  income  to  reach  the  average.5
Immobility  is  particularly  pronounced  for
low-income African Americans.

Global inequities are massive
If unequal  opportunities  are  large  within
many countries, they are truly staggering on
a global scale. Chapter 3 shows that cross-
country differences begin with the opportu-
nity  for  life  itself: while  7  of every  1,000
American babies die in the ﬁrst year of their
lives, 126 of every 1,000 Malian babies do.
Babies who survive, not only in Mali but in
much of Africa and in the poorer countries
of Asia  and  Latin  America, are  at  much
greater nutritional risk than their counter-
parts  in  rich  countries. And  if they  go  to
school—more  than  400  million  adults  in
developing  countries  never  did—their
schools  are  substantially  worse  than  those
attended  by  children  in  Europe, Japan, or
the United States. Given lower school qual-

ity, undernutrition, and the earnings a child
can  generate  by  working  instead  of study-
ing, many  children  leave  school  early. The
average  person  born  between  1975  and
1979  in  Sub-Saharan  Africa  has  only  5.4
years of schooling. In South Asia, the ﬁgure
rises  to  6.3  years; in  OECD  countries, it  is
13.4 years.

With  such  differences  in  education  and
health, compounded by large disparities in
access  to  infrastructure  and  other  public
services, it is not surprising that opportuni-
ties  for  the  consumption  of private  goods
differ  vastly  between  rich  and  poor  coun-
tries. Mean  annual  consumption  expendi-
tures  range  from  Purchasing  Power  Parity
(PPP)  $279  in  Nigeria  to  PPP  $17,232  in
Luxembourg. This  means  that  the  average
citizen  in  Luxembourg  enjoys  monetary
resources 62 times higher than the average
Nigerian. While  the  average  Nigerian  may
ﬁnd  it  difﬁcult  to  afford  adequately  nutri-
tious meals every day, the average citizen of
Luxembourg  need  not  worry  too  much
about  buying  the  latest  generation  cell
phone on the market. Because of the much
greater  restrictions  on  the  movement  of
people  between  countries  than  within
countries, these  inequalities  in  outcomes
among countries are likely to be much more
closely  associated  with 
in
opportunities than within countries.

inequalities 

Global  inequality  trends  have  varied.
Between  1960  and  1980  there  was  a  pro-
nounced  decline  in  the  inequality  in  life
expectancy  across  countries, driven  by
major increases in the poorest countries in
the world (ﬁgure 3). This welcome develop-
ment was due to the global spread of health
technology  and  to  major  public  health
efforts in some of the world’s highest mor-
tality areas. Since 1990, however, HIV/AIDS
(predominantly in many African countries)
and  a  rise  in  mortality  rates  in  transition
economies  (largely  in  Eastern  Europe  and
Central Asia) have set back some of the ear-
lier  gains. Because  of the  AIDS  crisis, life
expectancy  at  birth  has  fallen  dramatically
in  some  of the  world’s  poorest  countries,
sharply  increasing  the  differences  between
them and richer societies.

Inequality in access to schooling has also
been falling around the world, within most

countries as well as across them, as average
schooling levels rise in the vast majority of
countries. This  too  is  a  welcome  develop-
ment, although concerns over the quality of
schooling  provide  reasons  for  guarding
against complacency.

While  our  primary  concern  is  with
inequality  of opportunities, the  large  dif-
ferences in income or consumption across
countries surely affect the life chances faced
by  children  born  today  in  those  different
nations. Trends  in  life  expectancy  at  birth
and years of schooling were converging, at
least  until  1990, but  a  different  picture
emerges  for  income  and  consumption.
While the recent trends depend greatly on
the  speciﬁc  concept  chosen  (discussed  in
great  detail  in  chapter  3), global  income
inequality  has  steadily  increased  over  the
long run until the onset of rapid economic
growth  in  China  and  India  in  the  1980s
(ﬁgure 4).

It 

is  possible 

to  decompose 

total
inequality  across  individuals  in  the  world
into differences among countries and dif-
ferences  within  countries. Between-coun-
try differences were relatively small early in
the  nineteenth  century, but  they  came  to
account for a larger part of total inequality
toward the end of the twentieth century. If
China  and  India  are  excluded, global
inequalities have continued to rise, owing
to  the  continuing  divergence  between
most other low-income countries and rich
countries.

Overview

Why does equity matter 
for development?
Why  do  these  persistent  inequalities—
both within and across countries—matter?
The  first  reason  is  that  the  interconnec-
tions  and  resilience  of these  inequalities
imply that some groups have consistently
inferior  opportunities—economic, social,
and  political—than  their  fellow  citizens.
Most  people  feel  that  such  egregious  dis-
parities violate a sense of fairness, particu-
larly when the individuals affected can do
little about them (chapter 4). This is con-
sistent with the teachings of much politi-
cal philosophy and with the international
system  of human  rights. The  core  moral
and  ethical  teachings  of the  world’s  lead-
ing religions include a concern for equity,
although  many  have  also  been  sources  of
inequities and historically have been linked
to unequal power structures. There is also
experimental  evidence  suggesting  that
many—but  not  all—people  behave  in
ways  consistent  with  a  concern  for  fair-
ness, in addition to caring about how they
fare individually.

Important as these intrinsic reasons are
for caring about inequality of opportunities
and  unfair  processes, the  primary  focus  of
this report is on the instrumental relation-
ship between equity and development, with
particular  emphasis  on  two  channels: the
effects of unequal opportunities when mar-
kets are imperfect, and the consequences of
inequity  for  the  quality  of institutions  a
society develops.6

With  imperfect  markets,
inequalities  in
power  and  wealth  translate  into  unequal
opportunities, leading to wasted productive
potential and to an inefﬁcient allocation of
resources. Markets  often  work  imperfectly
in  many  countries, whether  because  of
intrinsic failures—such as those associated
with  asymmetric  information—or  because
of policy-imposed  distortions. Microeco-
nomic  case  studies  suggest  that  an  inefﬁ-
cient allocation of resources across produc-
tive  alternatives  is  often  associated  with
differences in wealth or status (chapter 5).

If capital markets worked perfectly, there
would  be  no  relation  between  investment

8

WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2006

and the distribution of wealth: anyone with
a proﬁtable investment opportunity would
be able to either borrow money to ﬁnance
it, or to sell equity in a ﬁrm set up to under-
take  it. But  capital  markets  in  just  about
every  country  (developed  and  developing)
are very far from perfect: credit is rationed
across prospective clients, and interest rates
differ  considerably  across  borrowers, and
between  lenders  and  borrowers, in  ways
that  cannot  be  linked  to  default  risk  or
other  economic  factors  affecting  expected
returns  to  lenders. For  example, interest
rates  decline  with  loan  size  in  Kerala  and
Tamil  Nadu  in  India, and  across  trading
groups in Kenya and Zimbabwe, in ways not
explained  by  risk  differences.7 In  Mexico,
returns  to  capital  are  much  higher  for  the
smallest  informal  sector  ﬁrms  than  for
larger ones.

Land  markets  also  have  imperfections
associated with a lack of clear titling, histo-
ries  of concentrated  land  ownership, and
imperfect  rental  markets. In  Ghana, lower
security  of tenure  among  women  leads  to
an  inefﬁciently  low  frequency  of land  fal-
lowing  and, hence, to  progressive  declines
in land productivity.

The  market  for  human  capital  is  also
imperfect, because parents make decisions on

behalf of their  children  and  because  the
expected returns to investment are inﬂuenced
by  location, contacts, and  discrimination—
on  grounds  of gender, caste, religion, or
race. Discrimination  and  stereotyping—
mechanisms for the reproduction of inequal-
ity  between  groups—have  been  found  to
lower  the  self-esteem, effort, and  perform-
ance  of individuals  in  the  groups  discrimi-
nated against. This reduces their potential for
individual  growth  and  their  ability  to  con-
tribute to the economy.

the 

Striking  evidence  of

impact  of
stereotyping on performance comes from a
recent  experiment  in  India. Children  from
different castes were asked to complete sim-
ple  exercises, such  as  solving  a  maze, with
real monetary incentives contingent on per-
formance. The key result of the experiment
is  that  low-caste  children  perform  on  par
with high-caste children when their caste is
not  publicly  announced  by  the  experi-
menter  but  signiﬁcantly  worse  when  it  is
made public (ﬁgure 5). If a similar inhibi-
tion of talent occurs in the real world, this
implies a loss of potential output owing to
social stereotyping.

impaired 

Economic  and  political  inequalities  are
associated  with 
institutional
development. The second channel through
which  inequity  affects  long-run  processes
of development is the shaping of economic
and political institutions (chapter 6). Insti-
tutions  determine  the  incentives  and  con-
straints people face and provide the context
in which markets function. Different sets of
institutions  are  the  outcome  of complex
historical processes that reﬂect the interests
and  structure  of political  inﬂuence  of
different individuals and groups in a soci-
ety. From  this  perspective, market  im-
perfections  may  arise  not  by  accident  but
because they distribute income or power in
particular  ways. In  this  view, there  will  be
social  conﬂict  over  the  institutions  of
society and incentives for people who con-
trol  power  to  shape  institutions  in  ways
that beneﬁt them.

The  central  argument  here  is  that
unequal  power  leads  to  the  formation  of
institutions that perpetuate inequalities in
power, status, and wealth—and that typi-

cally are also bad for the investment, inno-
vation, and  risk-taking  that  underpin
long-term growth. Good economic insti-
tutions  are  equitable  in  a  fundamental
way: to  prosper, a  society  must  create
incentives  for  the  vast  majority  of the
population  to  invest  and  innovate. But
such an equitable set of economic institu-
tions can emerge only when the distribu-
tion of power is not highly unequal and in
situations  in  which  there  are  constraints
on the exercise of power by officeholders.
Basic  patterns  in  cross-country  data  and
historical narratives support the view that
countries moving onto institutional paths
that promoted sustained prosperity did so
because  the  balance  of political  influence
and power became more equitable.

One example comes from a comparison
of the  early  institutions  and  of the  long-
term  development  paths  of European
colonies in North and South America. The
abundance  of unskilled  labor  prevalent  in
the South American colonies—where either
native  Americans  or 
imported  African
slaves  were  available  in  large  numbers—
combined  with  the  technology  of mining
and large plantation agriculture to provide
the  economic  base  for  hierarchical  and
extractive  societies, in  which  land  owner-
ship  and  political  power  were  highly  con-
centrated. In  North  America, by  contrast,
similar  attempts  to  introduce  hierarchical
structures  were  foiled  by  the  scarcity  of
labor—except  where  agro-climatic  condi-
tions  made  slavery  economically  feasible,
such as in the southern region of the United
States. Competition  for  free  labor  in  the
northern areas of North America led to the
development  of less  unequal  land  owner-
ship patterns, a faster expansion of the fran-
chise, and  rapid  increases  in  literacy  and
basic  education. The  resulting  economic
and  political  institutions  persisted  over
time, with  positive  consequences  for  long-
run economic development.

Leveling the economic 
and political playing ﬁelds
So a portion of the economic and political
inequalities we observe around the world is
attributable to unequal opportunities. This

inequality is objectionable on both intrinsic
and instrumental grounds. It contributes to
economic inefﬁciency, political conﬂict, and
institutional  frailty. What  are  the  implica-
tions for policy, and do they give rise to an
agenda  that  is  different  from  the  poverty
reduction agenda already embraced by the
World Bank, other multilateral institutions,
and many governments? 

We  argue  that  an  equity  lens  enhances
the  poverty  reduction  agenda. The  poor
generally  have  less  voice, less  income, and
less access to services than most other peo-
ple. When societies become more equitable
in ways that lead to greater opportunities for
all, the poor stand to beneﬁt from a “double
dividend.” First, expanded  opportunities
beneﬁt  the  poor  directly, through  greater
participation  in  the  development  process.
Second, the development process itself may
become  more  successful  and  resilient  as
greater  equity  leads  to  better  institutions,
more  effective  conﬂict  management, and  a
better use of all potential resources in soci-
ety, including  those  of the  poor. Resulting
increases in economic growth rates in poor
countries  will,
in  turn, contribute  to  a
reduction in global inequities.

One manifestation of the greater partic-
ipation of the poor in economic growth is
the  fact  that  the  growth  elasticity  of
poverty reduction falls with greater income
inequality. In  other  words, the  impact  of
(the  same  amount  of)  growth  on  poverty
reduction is signiﬁcantly greater when ini-
tial income inequality is lower. On average,
for  countries  with  low  levels  of income
inequality, a  1  percentage  point  growth  in
mean incomes leads to about a 4 percent-
age-point reduction in the incidence of $1
per day poverty. That power falls to close to
zero 
income
inequality.8 Policies  that  lead  to  greater
equity thus lead to lower poverty—directly
through  expanding  the  opportunities  of
the poor and indirectly through higher lev-
els of sustained development.

in  countries  with  high 

An  equity  lens  adds  three  new—or  at
least often neglected—perspectives to devel-
opment policymaking:

• First,

the  best  policies  for  poverty
reduction could involve redistributions

10

WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2006

of influence, advantage, or  subsidies
away  from  dominant  groups. Highly
unequally distributed wealth associated
with  unduly  concentrated  political
power  can  prevent  institutions  from
enforcing  broad-based  personal  and
property rights, and lead to skewed pro-
visioning of services and functioning of
markets. This  is  unlikely  to  change
unless  voice  and  influence, and  public
resources, shift  away  from  the  domi-
nant  group  toward  those  with  fewer
opportunities.9

• Second, while  such  equity-enhancing
redistributions  (of power, or  access  to
government spending and markets) can
often  be  efﬁciency-increasing, possible
tradeoffs  need  to  be  assessed  in  the
design  of policy. At  some  point, higher
tax  rates  to  ﬁnance  spending  on  more
schools  for  the  poorest  will  create  so
much  disincentive  to  effort  or  invest-
ment  (depending  on  how  the  taxes  are
raised), that  one  should  stop  raising
them. When  making  a  policy  choice
along such tradeoffs, the full value of the
beneﬁts 
from  equity  enhancement
should  be  considered. If greater  spend-
ing  on  schools  for  lower-caste  children
means  that, over  the  long  term, stereo-
typing will decline in society, with atten-
dant  increases  in  performance  that  are
additional  to  the  speciﬁc  gains  from
greater  schooling  today,
these  gains
should not be ignored.

• Third, the  dichotomy  between  policies
for  growth  and  policies  speciﬁcally
aimed at equity is false. The distribution
of opportunities and the growth process
are jointly determined. Policies that affect
one  will  affect  the  other. This  does  not
mean  that  each  policy  needs  to  take
equity  into  account  individually:
for
example,
the  best  way  to  deal  with
inequitable  effects  of a  particular  trade
reform is not always through ﬁne-tuning
trade policy itself (which might make it
more susceptible to capture) but through
complementary  policies  for  safety  nets,
labor mobility, and education. The over-
all package and the fairness of the under-
lying process are what matter.

The analysis of development experience
clearly shows the centrality of overall politi-
cal  conditions—supporting  the  emphasis
on governance and empowerment in recent
years. However, it  is  neither  the  mandate
nor  the  comparative  advantage  of
the
World Bank to engage in advice on issues of
political design. In turning to policy impli-
cations, we focus instead on the core areas
of development  policy, while  recognizing
that policy design needs to take account of
the broader social and political context, and
that  accountability  mechanisms  inﬂuence
development effectiveness.

Because  economic  policies  are  deter-
mined  within  a  sociopolitical  reality, how
policies  are  designed,
introduced, or
reformed matters as much as which speciﬁc
policies  are  proposed. Policy  reforms  that
result in losses for a particular group will be
resisted by that group. If the group is pow-
erful, it will usually subvert the reform. The
sustainability  of reforms, therefore, may
depend  on  making  information  about  its
distributional  consequences  publicly  avail-
able  and, perhaps, forming  coalitions  of
middle  and  poorer  groups  that  stand  to
gain  from  them  to  “empower,” directly  or
indirectly, relatively  disadvantaged  mem-
bers of society.

How  policies  are  implemented  has  a
technical aspect as well. Just as we empha-
size that the full long-term beneﬁts of redis-
tributions  need  to  be  taken  into  account
when  making  policy  choices, so  must  all
their  costs. A  focus  on  equity  does  not
change the facts that asset expropriations—
even in instances of historical grievances—
may  have  adverse  consequences  for  subse-
quent  investment, that  high  marginal  tax
rates  create  disincentives  to  work, or  that
inﬂationary  ﬁnancing  of budget  deﬁcits
tends to lead to regressive implicit taxation,
economic  disorganization, and  reduced
investment and growth. In short, a focus on
equity must not be an excuse for poor eco-
nomic policy.

The  report  discusses  the  role  of public
action in leveling the economic and politi-
cal playing ﬁeld under four main headings.
Three  of the  headings  concern  domestic
policies:
investing  in  human  capacities;
expanding access to justice, land, and infra-

structure; and  promoting  fairness  in  mar-
kets. The fourth turns to policies for greater
global equity, in terms of access to markets,
resource ﬂows, and governance.

Throughout  the  discussion, the  report
weighs a desire to be speciﬁc and practical
against the fact that the best speciﬁc policy
mix  is  a  function  of country  context. The
educational  challenges  facing  Sudan  are
different  from  those  facing  Egypt. The
optimal sequencing of reform in the public
sectors of Latvia and Bolivia are unlikely to
be  the  same. The  capacity  for  implement-
ing  health  ﬁnance  reform  in  China  and
Lesotho are also different. So the detailed,
speciﬁc  policy  advice  always  needs  to  be
developed at the country—or even subna-
tional—level. Everything that is said below
therefore  retains  some  level  of generality
and should be interpreted accordingly, and
cautiously.

Human capacities
Early  childhood  development. In  many
developing  countries, the  actions  of the
state in providing services magnify—rather
than  attenuate—inequalities  at  birth. A
guiding  principle  is  to  shape  public  action
so that the acquisition of human capacities
is  not  driven  by  circumstances  of their
birth, although it can reﬂect people’s prefer-
ences, tastes, and talents.

Because  differences  in  cognitive  devel-
opment  start  to  widen  from  a  very  early
age (see figure 2), early childhood develop-
ment  initiatives  can  be  central  to  more
equal opportunities. Evidence supports the
view that investing in early childhood has
large  impacts  on  children’s  health  and
readiness to learn and can bring important
economic  returns 
life—often
greater than investments in formal educa-
tion and training.

An  experiment  in  Jamaica  focused  on
undersized children (ages 9 to 24 months)
and  found  that  they  suffered  from  lower
levels of cognitive development than those
of normal height. Nutritional supplements
and a program of regular exposure to men-
tal stimulation, helped offset this disadvan-
tage. After  24  months, kids  who  received
both better nutrition and more stimulation
had  virtually  caught  up  developmentally

with children who started life at a normal
height (ﬁgure 6). This illustrates how deci-
sive  and  well-designed  public  action  can
substantially  reduce  the  opportunity  gaps
between those least privileged and the soci-
etal norm. Investing in the neediest people
early in their childhoods can help level the
playing ﬁeld.

Schooling. The process continues through-
out  the  school  system. Actions  to  equalize
opportunities  in  formal  education  need  to
ensure  that  all  children  acquire  at  least  a
basic level of skills necessary to participate
in  society  and  in  today’s  global  economy.
Even  in  such  middle-income  countries  as
Colombia, Morocco, and  the  Philippines,
most  children  completing  basic  education
lack  an  adequate  level  of achievement, as
measured  by  internationally  comparable
test scores (chapters 2 and 7).

Access  to  schooling  matters—especially
in very poor countries—but, in many coun-
tries, it is only a small part of the problem.
Greater access needs to be complemented by
supply-side  policies  (to  raise  quality)  and
demand-side policies (to correct for the pos-
sibility  that  parents  may  underinvest  in  the
education  of their  children  for  various  rea-
sons). There are no magic bullets for this, but
increasing  teachers’
incentives, enhancing
the  basic  quality  of the  school’s  physical
infrastructure, and  researching  and  imple-
menting  teaching  methods  to  increase  the
learning  performance  of students  who  do

12

WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2006

not do well when left to their own devices are
some of the suggestions on the supply side.

On the demand side, there is now a con-
siderable  body  of evidence  showing  that
scholarships conditional on attendance have
signiﬁcant  impacts. Such  transfers  work  in
countries from Bangladesh to Brazil, with the
impacts often greater for girls. There are also
promising  approaches  to  bring  in  excluded
groups—as  in  the  Vidin  model  of reaching
Roma in Bulgaria—and to bring up those left
behind  through  remedial  education—as  in
the Balsakhi program using young women as
para-teachers in 20 cities in India. As argued
in  World  Development  Report  2004, devel-
oping  the  accountability  of schools  and
teachers to students, parents, and the broader
community can help ensure effective service
provider behavior.

Health. Two  areas  stand  out  in  reducing
inequity and tackling economic distortions
in  the  provision  of health  services. First,
there are many cases when the beneﬁts spill
over  beyond  the  direct  beneﬁciary  in  a
range  of areas  of service  provision: for
immunization, for  water  and  sanitation,
and  for  information  on  hygiene  and  child
care. Public  assurance  of provisioning
makes  sense  in  these  areas. Demand-side
subsidies to provide incentives for maternal
and  child  health  increase  use, offsetting
possible  information  problems  as  in  Mex-
ico’s Oportunidades program.

Second,

insurance  markets 

for  cata-
strophic health problems are beset with fail-
ures. (Here “catastrophic” is in relation to the
capacity  of the  household  to  deal  with  the
direct costs and the loss in earnings.) The tra-
ditional supply-side model of relying on pub-
lic hospitals works badly, especially for poor
and excluded groups. What can work better is
public  provisioning  or  regulation  that  pro-
vides  some  insurance  for  all. Examples
include  risk  pooling  in  Colombia, health
cards  in  Indonesia  and Vietnam, and  Thai-
land’s “30-baht” universal  coverage  scheme.
As  with  education, these  interventions  need
to be combined with incentives for providers
to be responsive to all groups.

Risk  management. Social  protection  sys-
tems shape opportunities by providing peo-

ple with a safety net. In addition to ill health,
macroeconomic crises, industrial restructur-
ing, weather, and natural disasters can con-
strain investment and innovation. The poor,
with  the  lowest  capacity  to  manage  shocks,
generally  are  the  least  well  covered  by  risk-
management  structures, although  in  most
countries  many  among  the  non-poor  risk
falling  into  poverty. Broader  social  protec-
tion  systems  can  help  prevent  today’s
inequalities—sometimes  generated  by  bad
luck—from becoming entrenched and lead-
ing  to  tomorrow’s  inequities. Just  as  safety
nets can spur households to engage in riskier
activities that can yield higher returns, they
can also help complement reforms that pro-
duce losers.

Safety  nets  typically  target  three  groups:
the working poor, people viewed as unable to
work or for whom work is undesirable, and
special  vulnerable  groups. If safety  nets  are
designed in a manner appropriate to the local
realities on the ground in each country, indi-
vidual  targeted  interventions  in  these  three
categories  can  be  combined  to  provide  an
effectively universal public insurance system.
In such a system, each household that suffers
a negative shock, and falls below some prede-
termined  threshold  of
living  standards,
would qualify for some form of state support.

Taxes for equity. Successful interventions to
level  the  playing  ﬁeld  require  adequate
resources. The main aim of good tax policy is
to mobilize sufﬁcient funding, while distort-
ing  incentives  and  compromising  growth  as
little  as  possible. Because  taxes  impose  efﬁ-
ciency  costs  by  altering  individual  choices
between labor and leisure and consumption
and  savings, most  developing  countries  are
likely to be best served by avoiding high mar-
ginal taxes on income and relying on a broad
base, especially  for  taxes  on  consumption.
Public spending should play the primary role
in  actively  furthering  equity. Nevertheless,
there is some scope for making the overall tax
system moderately progressive without large
efﬁciency costs. Societies that desire such an
outcome can consider simple exemptions for
basic  foodstuffs, and  an  expanded  role  for
property taxation, for example.

While the capacity of the tax administra-
tion and the structure of the economy inﬂu-

Overview

13

ence the ability to raise revenues, the quality
of institutions  and  the  nature  of the  social
compact  are  also  critical. When  citizens  can
rely on services actually being provided, they
likely  are  more  willing  to  be  taxed. Con-
versely, a corrupt or kleptocratic state engen-
ders little citizen trust in authority and little
incentive  to  cooperate. As  a  general  rule, a
more legitimate and representative state may
be a prerequisite to an adequate tax system,
even  as  the  notion  of adequacy  varies  from
country to country.

Justice, land, and infrastructure
The  development  of human  capacities  will
not  broaden  opportunities  if some  people
face  unfair  returns  on  those  capacities  and
unequal protection of their rights, and have
unequal  access  to  complementary  factors  of
production.

Building  equitable  justice  systems. Justice
systems  can  do  much  to  level  the  playing
ﬁeld  in  the  political, economic, and  socio-
cultural  domains, but  they  can  also  rein-
force  existing  inequalities. The  report  pays
attention to both codiﬁed law and the ways
in which the law is applied and enforced in
practice. Legal  institutions  can  uphold  the
political rights of citizens and curb the cap-
ture of the state by the elite. They can equal-
ize  economic  opportunities  by  protecting
property rights for all and ensuring nondis-
crimination  in  the  market. They  underpin
and reﬂect the rules of the game in society
and thus are central to fair process—and to
the  broad-based  property  rights  and  un-
biased  dispute  resolution  mechanisms  so
important for investment.

The  law  can  also  accelerate  shifts  in
norms, and  justice  systems  can  serve  as  a
progressive  force  for  change  in  the  social
domain  by  challenging  inequitable  prac-
tices. For example, the U.S. Civil Rights Act
of 1964 and Medicare in 1965 enforced the
desegregation  of hospitals  and  led  to  large
reductions  in  infant  mortality  for  African
Americans. Afﬁrmative  action  programs
have  also  been  shown  to  reduce  group-
based  differences  in  earnings  and  educa-
tion. But  they  can  become  politically
entrenched and limited to helping the bet-
ter-off among disadvantaged groups.

Equity in laws and fairness in their imple-
mentation involve striking a balance between
strengthening  the  independence  of justice
systems  and 
increasing  accountability—
especially to counter the risk that the pow-
erful and wealthy might corrupt, inﬂuence,
or  ignore  the  law. Measures  to  make  the
legal 
system  more  accessible—mobile
courts, legal aid, and working with custom-
ary institutions—all help reduce the barri-
ers  that  excluded  groups  face. Customary
institutions  raise  complex  issues  and  may
incorporate  inequities  (for  example, with
respect to gender), but they are too impor-
tant to be ignored. South Africa is an exam-
ple  of a  country  that  is  pursuing  a  policy
that  balances  recognition  of customary
practices with the rights and responsibilities
in state law.

Toward  greater  equity  in  access  to  land.
Broader  access  to  land  does  not  necessarily
have to come through ownership (chapter 8).
Instead, improving  the  functioning  of land
markets  and  providing  greater  security  of
tenure  for  poorer  groups  may  be  a  more
fruitful area for policy—as in rural Thailand
and  in  urban  Peru. Redistributive 
land
reform  can  make  sense  in  some  circum-
stances in which land inequalities are extreme
and  the  institutional  context  allows  for
designs  that  effectively  redistribute  land  to
smaller farms and support this with comple-
mentary  services, without  large  transitional
costs. But this can be difﬁcult, and tradeoffs
may  be  large  when  property  rights  have  a
high degree of legitimacy.

illegal  settlements, possibly 

Expropriating  land  (with  compensation)
is probably the most disruptive redistribution
instrument. Divesting  state  lands  and  recu-
perating 
in
exchange  for  titling  a  portion  of the  settle-
ment, may be two cost-effective alternatives.
Market or community-based approaches that
allow community members to obtain subsi-
dized  credit  for  land  rentals  or  purchases
according  to  the  willing-buyer-willing-seller
principle, as  in  Brazil  and  South  Africa,
appear promising. A land tax can be a useful
complement, generating  revenues  to  pur-
chase  land  to  redistribute  or  encouraging
redistribution  by  disproportionately  taxing
large or underused plots.

WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2006

Providing infrastructure equitably. Access to
infrastructure—roads,
electricity, water,
sanitation, telecoms—is typically highly un-
equal  across  groups. For  many  people  in
developing  countries,
lack  of access  to
affordable infrastructure services means liv-
ing  in  isolation  from  markets  and  services
and  having  intermittent  or  no  supply  of
power or water for productive activities and
daily existence. This often results in a signiﬁ-
cant curtailment of economic opportunities.
While  the  public  sector  will  in  many
cases  remain  the  main  source  of funds  for
infrastructure investments aimed at broad-
ening opportunities for those who have the
fewest, the  efﬁciency  of the  private  sector
can also be harnessed. Although utility pri-
vatizations  have  often  been  attacked  for
having  unequal  effects, the  evidence  indi-
cates a more complex reality. Privatizations
in Latin America typically led to expansions
in access to services, particularly in electric-
ity and telecommunications. In some cases,
however, postprivatization 
in
prices  more  than  outweighed  gains  from
quality and coverage, leading to widespread
popular discontent.

increases 

Privatizations are therefore a classic case
of a policy that may or may not make sense,
depending on the local context. If the public
system is highly corrupt or inefﬁcient, and
one  expects  postprivatization  regulatory
capacity  to  be  adequate, it  can  be  a  useful
tool. In other cases, poorly designed privati-
zations may be captured, transferring pub-
lic assets, at excessively low prices, into pri-
vate hands.

Experience  suggests  that  whether  infra-
structure  services  are  provided  by  private
operators  or  public  utilities  seems  less
important  for  equity  than  the  structure  of
incentives 
facing  providers  and  how
accountable these providers are to the gen-
eral public. We argue that policymakers can
improve  the  equitable  provision  of infra-
structure  services  by  focusing  on  expand-
ing  affordable  access  for  poor  people  and
poor  areas—which  often  means  working
with 
informal  providers  and  targeting
subsidies—and  strengthening  the  gover-
nance  of the  sector  through  the  greater
accountability  of
the
stronger voice of beneﬁciaries.

Markets and the macroeconomy
Markets are central to shaping the potential
for  people  to  convert  their  assets  into  out-
comes. When market transactions are inﬂu-
enced by the wealth or status of participants,
they  are  both  inequitable  and  inefﬁcient—
and  can  also  inﬂuence  the  incentives  for
different  groups  to  expand  their  assets
(chapter 9).

Financial  markets. Captured  banking  sys-
tems exchange favors: market power is pro-
tected for a few large banks, which then lend
favorably to a few selected enterprises, which
may not be those with the highest expected
risk-adjusted returns. This may lie behind a
cross-country  association  between  greater
ﬁnancial  depth  and  lower  income  inequal-
ity. Achieving  more  equal  access  to  ﬁnance
by  broadening  ﬁnancial  systems  thus  can
help  productive  ﬁrms  that  were  previously
beyond the reach of formal ﬁnance.

These relations are only suggestive, how-
ever, so  the  report  draws  on  case  studies
from  middle-income  economies, such  as
the  Republic  of Korea, Malaysia, Mexico,
and  the  Russian  Federation, and  poorer
economies, including  Indonesia  and  Pak-
istan, to  provide  more  concrete  evidence.
These studies suggest an apparent paradox.
Societies  with  extensive 
in
power  and  wealth, weak  institutions, and
controlled ﬁnancial systems typically suffer
from  narrow  ﬁnancial  sectors  that  are  ori-
ented to the inﬂuential and hide weak asset
quality. Opening the ﬁnancial system would
seem to be an obvious solution. Liberaliza-
tion, however, has also often been captured
by  the  inﬂuential  or  wealthy, in  countries
ranging from Mexico (in the early 1990s) to
transition  economies  such  as  the  Czech
Republic and Russia.

inequalities 

Gradual  deepening  and  broadening  thus
needs to be combined with stronger horizon-
tal  accountability  (in  regulatory  structures),
greater  openness  to  societal  accountability,
and, where  feasible, external  commitment
devices  (such  as  the  entry  of Central  Euro-
pean  and  Baltic  states  to  the  European
Union). Programs  targeted  to  the  poor—
such  as  microcredit  schemes—can  help  but
are no substitute for the overall broadening of
access.

Labor markets. Leveling the playing ﬁeld in
labor  markets  consists  of seeking  the  right
(country-speciﬁc) balance between ﬂexibility
and protection to provide more equal access
to equal employment conditions to as many
workers  as  possible. Many  countries  have
fairly extensive regulations and provisions for
formal sector workers, and far fewer for “out-
siders” in the unregulated (and often less safe)
informal sector. There is usually a degree of
voluntary  movement  between  the  sectors,
and great diversity within the informal sector
itself, ranging from microentrepreneurs and
some  of the  self-employed  with  incomes
above  formal  sector  workers  to  many  with
much  worse  employment  conditions. This
mix leads to inadequate protection for poorer
workers, while regulations for formal workers
can reduce the ﬂexibility of employment and
often are a poor deal for the workers them-
selves, such as when job-related social secu-
rity systems are inefﬁcient.

Two broad labor market approaches are
relevant  for  equity. First, interventions  in
the  labor  market  should  ensure  effective
application  of
the  core  labor  standards
across the whole market, implying no slave
or indentured work, no dangerous forms of
child labor, and no discrimination. Workers
should be free to assemble and form associ-
ations, and  their  unions  should  be  free  to
have an active role in bargaining. Second, in
all areas the policy mix needs to be assessed
in  ways  that  balance  protection  (for  all
workers) with allowances for the restructur-
ing  so  central  to  dynamic  growth  and
employment creation.

Worker security is often provided by vari-
ous  excessively  stringent  forms  of employ-
ment protection legislation, which, in general
make  it  costly  to  hire  and, in  some  cases,
make it even costlier to hire unskilled, young,
and  female  workers—exactly  those  the  laws
seek to protect. For many countries, less dis-
tortionary and more inclusive policy alterna-
tives are available, which may make the play-
ing ﬁeld more even in labor markets. These
alternatives  include  unemployment  insur-
ance schemes (more likely in middle-income
countries) 
employment
schemes (ideally with an employment guar-
antee), which can be applied successfully even
in poor countries or states.

Product  markets. There  is  substantial  het-
erogeneity in the effects of opening a coun-
try’s product markets to trade, at least in the
short to medium term. This can be due to
geographic  location, as  illustrated  by  the
varying  impact  of trade  liberalization  in
Mexico  (ﬁgure  7). This 
illustrates  the
importance of interactions between domes-
tic  product  markets  and  patterns  of infra-
structure  provision. There  are  also  often
strong  interactions  with  skills  in  the  labor
market. In  many  countries, opening  to
trade (often coinciding with opening to for-
eign direct investment) has been associated
with rising inequality in earnings in the past
two  decades. This  is  especially  so  for  mid-
dle-income  countries, notably  in  Latin
America. Opening to trade often boosts the
premium on skills as ﬁrms modernize their
production processes (skill-biased technical
change, in the jargon of economists). This is
bad  for  equity  if the  institutional  context
restricts the capacity of workers to shift into
new work—or limits future cohorts’ access
to education.

Macroeconomic stability. This report argues
that there are two-way relationships between
inequitable institutions and macroeconomic
crises, with mostly bad effects for equity and

16

long-run growth. Weak and captured institu-
tions are associated with a greater propensity
for countries to experience macroeconomic
crises. When crises occur, they can be costly
for  the  poor, who  have  weaker  instruments
to manage shocks. In addition, crisis resolu-
tion is often regressive, through a variety of
mechanisms (most of them not captured in
traditional  household  survey  instruments):
declines in the labor share, at least for formal
workers; capital gains for those who get their
money out; and ﬁscal workouts that bail out
the  inﬂuential  at  substantial  cost. Such
bailouts  must  be  paid  for  through  some
combination  of higher  taxes  and  lower
spending. Because taxes are typically propor-
tional  and  spending  is  often  progressive  at
the  margin  (notably  in  Latin America), the
cost  of bailouts  is  borne  disproportionately
by  poorer  groups. High  inﬂation  has  also
been  found  to  be  both  bad  for  growth  and
regressive in its impact.

A concern for equity would lead, in gen-
eral, to a highly prudent stance on macroeco-
nomic management and ﬁnancial regulation.
Populist  macroeconomic  policy, sooner  or
later, is  bad  for  equity  and  bad  for  growth.
Policy design can increase equity through the
pursuit of countercyclical ﬁscal policy, build-
ing safety nets before a crisis, reducing risky
lending, and supporting only smaller deposi-
tors in bailouts. But, as in other policy areas,
these  responses  need  to  be  underpinned  by
institutional  designs  that  combine  greater
institutional freedom from political inﬂuence
(such as independent central banks and auto-
nomous  ﬁnancial  regulatory  agencies)  with
greater information and debate in society.

The global arena
One  predetermined  circumstance  that  most
powerfully determines a person’s opportuni-
ties for leading a healthy and productive life is
his or her country of birth. Global inequities
are massive. Reducing them will depend pri-
marily on domestic policies in poor countries
through their impact on growth and develop-
ment. But global action can change external
conditions and affect the impact of domestic
policies. In  this  sense, global  and  domestic
actions are complementary.

We  live  in  an  integrated  world  in  which
people, goods, ideas, and capital ﬂow across

countries. Indeed, most policy advice given to
poor countries over the last several decades—
including  that  by  the  World  Bank—has
emphasized  the  advantages  of participating
in the global economy. But global markets are
far  from  equitable, and  the  rules  governing
their  functioning  have  a  disproportionately
negative  effect  on  developing  countries
(chapter 10). These rules are the outcome of
complex  negotiating  processes  in  which
developing  countries  have  less  voice. More-
over, even  if markets  worked  equitably,
unequal endowments would limit the ability
of poor  countries  to  beneﬁt  from  global
opportunities. Leveling the global economic
and political playing ﬁelds thus requires more
equitable rules for the functioning of global
markets, more effective participation of poor
countries in global rule-setting processes, and
more actions to help build and maintain the
endowments  of poor  countries  and  poor
people.

The report documents some of the many
inequities in the functioning of global mar-
kets  for  labor, goods,
ideas, and  capital.
Unskilled workers from poor countries, who
could  earn  higher  returns  in  rich  countries,
face great hurdles in migrating. Developing-
country  producers  face  obstacles  in  selling
agricultural  products, manufactured  goods,
and  services  in  developed  countries. Patent
protection  restricts  access  to  innovations
(particularly drugs) for poor countries, while
new  research  is  strongly  oriented  to  the
diseases  of richer  societies. Rich-country
investors often get better deals in debt crises.
In  most  cases, more  equitable  rules  would
bring beneﬁts to developed- and developing-
country citizens. Beneﬁts vary across markets
and countries, with those from greater legal
migration likely to be greatest (and to accrue
directly  to  migrants)  and  those  from  trade
likely  to  accrue  mostly  to  middle-income
rather than the least developed countries.

The  report  discusses  options  to  reduce
inequities in the functioning of global mar-
kets, including the following: allowing greater
temporary  migration  into  OECD  countries,
achieving  ambitious 
liberalization
under the Doha Round, allowing poor coun-
tries  to  use  generic  drugs, and  developing
ﬁnancial  standards  more  appropriate  to
developing countries.

The international laws that govern global
markets are the product of complex negotia-
tions. In  some  cases, as  for  human  rights
covenants, the processes generating the laws
are  perceived  to  be  fair. In  other  cases,
processes  and  outcomes  are  perceived  as
unfair, even  though  the  formal  regulations
are equitable. Within the World Trade Orga-
nization  (WTO), for  example, each  country
has  a  vote  and  each  can  block  proceedings.
Even  so, WTO  processes  are  at  times  per-
ceived  as  unfair  because  of the  underlying
power imbalance between strong commercial
interests  and  the  public  interest, in  both
developed  and  developing  countries. These
imbalances manifest themselves, for instance,
in  the  number  of staff employed  in  Geneva
by  different  WTO  members. More  effective
representation  of poor  countries  in  global
institutions  would  help  improve  processes
and may lead to more equitable rules.

The impact of reducing imperfections in
global markets varies by country. The larger
and fast-growing developing countries stand
to  beneﬁt  signiﬁcantly  from  freer  global
trade, migration, and  capital  ﬂows, helping
them  sustain  fast  growth  (while  equitable
domestic  policies  both  help  underpin  long-
run growth and the broad internal sharing of
this  growth). Countries  left  behind  in  the
global  economy  stand  to  beneﬁt  much  less
from global markets in the short run and will
continue  to  rely  on  aid. For  them, global
action  that  helps  compensate  for  unequal
endowments is truly essential. Action to build
endowments is primarily domestic, through
public  investments  in  human  development,
infrastructure and governance structures. But
global  action  can  support  domestic  policies
through resource transfers in the form of aid,
which is not offset by debt repayments, and
investments in global public goods, particu-
larly global commons.

Aid levels need to be bolstered in line with
the commitments rich countries made at the
2002  Monterrey  Conference  and  concrete
plans should be made to reach the target of

devoting 0.7 percent of gross national income
to aid. Larger volumes of aid will only help,
however, if aid is effective in alleviating con-
straints  and  spurring  development  in  the
recipient countries. Greater effectiveness can
be  achieved  by  emphasizing  results, moving
away  from  ex  ante  conditionality, and  pro-
gressively  shifting  design  and  management
from donors to recipients. Aid should not be
undermined by debt, for debt reduction that
is  not  ﬁnanced  by  additional  resources  can
actually  undercut  effective  aid  programs.
Innovative  mechanisms  to  expand  develop-
ment  assistance  should  be  explored, includ-
ing global taxes and private contributions.

Equity and development
Bringing equity to the center of development
builds on and integrates the major emphases
in development thinking of the past 10 to 20
years—on markets, on human development,
on  governance, and  on  empowerment. It  is
noteworthy that this year equity is the focus of
both this World Development Report and the
Human  Development  Report  of the  United
Nations Development Programme. The plea
for a more level playing ﬁeld in both the pol-
itics and the economies of developing coun-
tries  serves  to  integrate  the  World  Bank’s
twin  pillars  of building  an  institutional  cli-
mate conducive to investment and empow-
ering the poor. By ensuring that institutions
enforce  personal, political, and  property
rights  for  all,
including  those  currently
excluded, countries  will  be  able  to  draw  on
much larger pools of investors and innova-
tors, and be much more effective in provid-
ing  services  to  all  their  citizens. Greater
equity  can, over  the  long  term, underpin
faster growth. This can be helped by greater
fairness in the global arena, not least through
the  international  community’s  meeting  its
commitments  made  at  Monterrey. Faster
growth  and  human  development  in  poorer
countries  are  essential  to  reducing  global
inequity  and  to  reaching  the  Millennium
Development Goals.

Introduction

Nthabiseng  and  Pieter—the  hypothetical
South  African  children  who  opened  the
report’s overview—are not unusual exam-
ples  of people  who  face  highly  disparate
initial opportunities. A girl born to a lower-
caste family of nine in the slums of Dhaka
has  vastly  different  opportunities  from  a
boy  born  to  well-educated  and  afﬂuent
parents in the well-heeled neighborhoods.
An  AIDS  orphan  in  rural  Zimbabwe  is
almost  certain  to  have  fewer  chances  and
choices  in  life  than  a  compatriot  born  to
healthy  and  well-educated  parents 
in
Harare. Those  differences  are  even  greater
across borders: an average Swiss, American,
or Japanese child born at the same instant
as  Nthabiseng  will  have 
incomparably
superior life chances.

Such staggering inequalities in opportu-
nity  are  intrinsically  objectionable, and
almost  every  culture, religion, and  philo-
sophical  tradition  has  developed  argu-
ments and beliefs that place great value on
equity for its own sake. In addition, Part II
of this report will argue that we now have
considerable  evidence  that  equity  is  also
instrumental  to  the  pursuit  of long-term
prosperity in aggregate terms for society as
a  whole. But  before  one  can  describe
inequity, or assess its impact on growth and
development, a clear deﬁnition of the term
is needed.

This  introductory  chapter  presents  our
working deﬁnition of equity and brieﬂy dis-
cusses  its  main  component—equality  of
opportunity. It then turns from our central
normative  concepts  to  one  of the  report’s
key  positive  concepts: inequality  traps. An
inequality  trap  encapsulates  the  mutually
reinforcing  nature  of various  inequalities,
which  leads  to  their  persistence  and  to  an
inferior development trajectory.

Equity and inequality of
opportunity: the basic concepts
What is equity? As with any normative con-
cept, the word “equity” means different things
to  different  people. It  is  a  difﬁcult  concept,
with  a  history  of different  interpretations,
varying by country and academic discipline.
Economists link equity to questions of distri-
bution. Lawyers  tend  to  think  of principles
meant to correct the strict application of the
law, which may lead to an outcome judged to
be unfair in speciﬁc circumstances. Philoso-
phers have produced the most headway in the
thinking about equity. Indeed, the attributes
that would characterize a just and fair society
lie at the foundation of Western political phi-
losophy, from Plato’s Republic and Aristotle’s
Politics onward. Equity is also central to most
of the world’s great religions, including Bud-
dhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, and
Judaism, as well as to most other faith tradi-
tions. More recently, social choice theory, and
the  closely  related  domain  of welfare  eco-
nomics, have been concerned with the aggre-
gation  of preferences  into  some  form  of
“social optimum.”

Summarizing  such  long-standing  and
nuanced  characterizations  is  perilous, but
the  common  denominator  of these  many
different views is that equity relates to fair-
ness, whether  locally  in  families  and  com-
munities, or globally across nations. We do
not  dwell  on  the  different  approaches  to
equity here, but we do elaborate on them in
chapter 4, which reviews various categories
of evidence  in  support  of
the  intrinsic
importance  of equity. For  this  report, we
think of equity as being deﬁned in terms of
two basic principles:

• Equal  opportunity. The  outcome  of a
person’s  life, in  its  many  dimensions,

Introduction

19

should  reﬂect  mostly  his  or  her  efforts
and  talents, not  his  or  her  background.
Predetermined  circumstances—gender,
race, place of birth, family origins—and
the  social  groups  a  person  is  born  into
should not help determine whether peo-
ple  succeed  economically, socially, and
politically.1

• Avoidance  of absolute  deprivation. An
aversion to extreme poverty, or indeed a
Rawlsian2 form of inequality aversion in
the  space  of outcomes, suggests  that
societies may decide to intervene to pro-
tect the livelihoods of its neediest mem-
bers  (below  some  absolute  threshold  of
need)  even  if
the  equal  opportunity
principle  has  been  upheld. The  road
from  opportunities  to  outcomes  can  be
tortuous. Outcomes may be low because
of bad luck, or even because of a person’s
own  failings. Societies  may  decide, for
insurance  or  for  compassion, that  its
members  will  not  be  allowed  to  starve,
even  if they  enjoyed  their  fair  share  of
the  opportunity  pie, but  things  some-
how turned out badly for them.

The equal opportunity principle is con-
ceptually  simple: circumstances  at  birth
should not matter for a person’s chances in
life. But to measure inequality of opportu-
nities is much harder. Chapter 2 brieﬂy dis-
cusses  one  approach, which  decomposes
observed  income  inequality  into  one  part
that can be attributed, in a statistical sense,
to  predetermined  circumstances—such  as
race, place  of birth, and  parental  back-
ground—and  one  part  that  cannot. The
ﬁrst  component  captures  a  lower  bound
value for the opportunity share of income
or  earnings  inequality. But  it  is  generally
very difﬁcult to measure things like family
background  precisely: years  of schooling
and  broad  occupational  categories  are
imperfect  proxies  for  a  family’s  endow-
ments of human, physical, and social capi-
tal.

A superior approach would be to capture
the inherently multidimensional and group-
based  nature  of inequality  of opportunity.
How  do  the  factors  that  determine  a  per-
son’s  chances  in  life—the  access  to  health
and educational opportunities, the ability to

connect to the rest of the world, the quality
of the services available, the way institutions
treat them—relate to one another? And how
do these factors vary across groups? Such an
approach would require a focus not only on
the  dispersion  of univariate  distributions
(such as income inequality or life expectancy)
but  also  on  the  correlations  among  them
(how do health outcomes vary across socio-
economic  groups?). This  is  the  approach
taken in most of chapter 2, which summa-
rizes information on inequalities (with em-
phasis on the plural) in the various building
blocks of opportunity and on their interre-
lationships.

In taking this route, the report recognizes
that predetermined circumstances, or mem-
bership in prespeciﬁed groups, affect oppor-
tunities in two ways:

• The circumstances of one’s birth affect the
endowments one starts with, including all
kinds  of private  assets, such  as  physical
wealth  (including 
land  and  ﬁnancial
assets), family  background  (the  human,
social, and  cultural  capital  of one’s  par-
ents), and  access  to  public  services  and
infrastructure  (sometimes  referred  to  as
geographic capital).

• Group  membership  and  initial  circum-
stances also affect how one is treated by
the  institutions  with  which  one  must
interact. Two individuals may both live in
areas  where  formal  labor  markets  exist,
where courts are agile, and where a police
force is present. But if these two (other-
wise  identical)  people, because  of their
gender, race, religion, sexual orientation,
political  beliefs, residential  address, or
any  other  morally  irrelevant  reason, are
differently rewarded for the same work in
the 
labor  market, are  discriminated
against by the court of law, or are treated
with  bias  by  the  police  force, then  the
rules are not being applied fairly. There-
fore, these  two  people  do  not  have  the
same  opportunity  sets. Equity  also
requires fairness in processes.

Endowments  that  are 

less  unequal,
processes that are fair, and protection from
deprivation  are  not  always  mutually  con-
sistent. At  the  policy  level, there  may  be

20

WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2006

tradeoffs among them. Indeed, some policies
or  institutions  developed  to  further  one  of
the principles may compromise the other.

For  example, a  policy  of afﬁrmative
action  that  seeks  to  correct  past  inequities
in  the  access  to  educational  opportunities
for one group—to equalize endowments—
may imply that individuals of greater merit
(but from another group) are excluded, cre-
ating  unfair  processes. For  another  exam-
ple, the  taxes  needed  to  raise  government
revenues to make transfers to poor individ-
uals (desirable to avoid deprivation) expro-
priate  some  fruits  of the  efforts  of hard-
working  men  and  women. This  might  be
seen  as  violating  property  rights  or  the
rights to appropriate the fruits of one’s own
labor, again creating unfair processes.

Whenever such tradeoffs exist—which is
most of the time—no textbook policy pre-
scription can be provided. Each society must
decide the relative weights it ascribes to each
of the  principles  of equity  and  to  the  efﬁ-
cient  expansion  of
total  production  (or
other  aggregate). This  report  will  not  pre-
scribe what is equitable for any society. That
is a prerogative of its members to be under-
taken  through  decision-making  processes
they regard as fair.

Inequality traps
If people care about equity, and if political
systems aggregate people’s views into social
preferences, why don’t the distributions we
observe represent optimal choices? Why do
inequalities  of opportunity  persist, if they
are  both  unfair  and  inimical  to  long-term
prosperity?  And  how  do  these  inequalities
reproduce themselves? The short answer is
that  political  systems  do  not  always  assign
equal  weights  to  everyone’s  preferences.
Policies and institutions do not arise from a
benign  social  planner  who  aims  to  maxi-
mize  the  present  value  of social  welfare.
They are the outcomes of political economy
processes in which different groups seek to
protect  their  own  interests. Some  groups
have  more  power  than  others, and  their
views prevail. When the interests of domi-
nant  groups  are  aligned  with  broader  col-
lective  goals, these  decisions  are  for  the
common good. When they are not, the out-
comes need be neither fair nor efﬁcient.

sociocultural inequalities

Institutions

The  interaction  of political, economic,
and  sociocultural  inequalities  shapes  the
institutions  and  rules  in  all  societies. The
way these institutions function affects peo-
ple’s opportunities and their ability to invest
and prosper. Unequal economic opportuni-
ties lead to unequal outcomes and reinforce
unequal  political  power. Unequal  power
shapes institutions and policies that tend to
foster  the  persistence  of the  initial  condi-
tions (ﬁgure 1.1).

Consider the status of women in patriar-
chal societies. Women are often denied prop-
erty  and  inheritance  rights. They  also  have
their  freedom  of movement  restricted  by
social norms that create separate “inside” and
“outside” spheres of activity for women and
men. These social inequalities have economic
consequences: girls are less likely to be sent to
school; women are less likely to work outside
the  home; women  generally  earn  less  than
men. This  reduces  the  options  for  women
outside  marriage  and  increases  their  eco-
nomic dependence on men. The inequalities
also have political consequences: women are
less  likely  to  participate  in  important  deci-
sions within and outside the home.

These  unequal  social  and  economic
structures tend to be readily reproduced. If
a  woman  has  not  been  educated  and  has
grown  up  to  believe  that  “good, decent”
women abide by existing social norms, she
is likely to transmit this belief to her daugh-
ters  and  to  enforce  such  behavior  among
her  daughters-in-law. An  inequality  trap
may  thus  prevent  generations  of women
from getting educated, restrict their partici-
pation in the labor market, and reduce their
ability  to  make  free, informed  choices  and
to realize their potential as individuals. This

Introduction

reinforces gender differences in power that
tend to persist over time.

Similarly,

the  unequal  distribution  of
power  between  the  rich  and  the  poor—
between dominant and subordinate groups—
helps  the  rich  maintain  control  over  re-
sources. Consider  an  agricultural  laborer
working  for  a  powerful  landlord. Illiteracy
and malnourishment may prevent him from
breaking out of the cycle of poverty. But he is
also  likely  to  be  heavily  indebted  to  his
employer, which  puts  him  under  the  land-
lord’s control. Even if laws were in place that
would  allow  him  to  challenge  his  landlord’s
dictates, being illiterate, he would ﬁnd it difﬁ-
cult to navigate the political and judicial insti-
tutions that might help him assert his rights.
In  many  parts  of the  world, this  distance
between  landlords  and  laborers  is  com-
pounded  by  entrenched  social  structures:
landlords  typically  belong  to  a  dominant
group  deﬁned  by  race  or  caste, tenants  and
laborers  to  a  subordinate  group. Because
members  of these  groups  often  face  severe
constraints from social norms against inter-
marrying, group-based  inequalities  are  per-
petuated across generations.

Poor individuals in geographically isolated
regions and racial and ethnic minorities also
have  less  political  power  and  less  voice  in
many  countries. This  affects  their  ability  to
propose  and  implement  policies  that  would
reduce  their  disadvantage, even  if such  poli-
cies might be growth-enhancing for the coun-
try.3 The  correlations  between  the  unequal
distribution  of assets, opportunities, and
political power give rise to a circular ﬂow of
mutually  reinforcing  patterns  of inequality.
Such a ﬂow, and its associated feedback loops,
help  inequalities  persist  over  long  periods—
even if they are inefﬁcient and deemed unfair
by a majority of the population.4

Economic  and  political  inequalities  are
themselves embedded in unequal social and
cultural  institutions.5 The  social  networks
that the poor have access to are substantially
different from those the rich can tap into. For
instance, a poor person’s social network may
be  geared  primarily  toward  survival, with
limited  access  to  networks  that  would  link
him or her to better jobs and opportunities.
The  rich, by  contrast, are  bequeathed  with
much  more  economically  productive  social

networks that maintain economic rank. Rich
parents  can  use  their  social  connections  to
ensure  that  their  child  gets  into  a  good
school, or they can call a few good friends to
make sure that their son gets a good job. Con-
versely, poor  parents  are  more  subject  to
chance. Connections open doors and reduce
constraints.

Social networks are closely allied with cul-
ture. (By  “culture” we  mean  aspects  of life
that deal with relationships among individu-
als  within  groups, among  groups, and
between ideas and perspectives). Subordinate
groups  may  face  adverse “terms  of recogni-
tion,” the framework within which they nego-
tiate  their  interactions  with  other  social
groups.6 One  obvious  expression  is  explicit
discrimination  that  can  lead  to  an  explicit
denial  of opportunities  and  to  a  rational
choice to invest less at the margin.

But the process may also be less overt. A
person  born  into  a  low  social  class  or  a
socially excluded group may adopt the domi-
nant group’s value system.7 Religious beliefs
may  propel  this: women  may  take  on  gen-
dered beliefs about their economic and social
role, and  low  castes  may  absorb  the  upper
castes’ view  of
their  “inferior” status. In
schools, a  stigmatized  group  may  face  a
“stereotype  threat,” adopting  the  dominant
group’s  view  of their  ability  to  perform  in
cognitive  tests  or  in  occupations  historically
controlled  by  dominant  groups.8 This  can
affect  a  discriminated  group’s  “capacity  to
aspire.”9 It also implies that “voice,” the capac-
ity  of individuals  to  inﬂuence  the  decisions
that  shape  their  lives, is  also  unequally  dis-
tributed and that “effort” and “ability” are not
necessarily exogenous (predetermined).10

The existence of these inequality traps—
with mutually reinforcing inequalities in the
economic, political,
social, and  cultural
domains—has two main implications for this
analysis. The ﬁrst implication is that, because
of market failures and of the ways in which
institutions evolve, inequality traps can affect
not only the distribution but also the aggre-
gate  dynamics  of growth  and  development.
This  in  turn  means  that, in  the  long  run,
equity  and  efﬁciency  may  be  complements,
not substitutes.11

Capital, land, and labor markets in devel-
oping countries are imperfect. Informational

asymmetries and contract enforcement prob-
lems  imply  that  some  people  with  good
project  ideas  (and  thus  a  potentially  high
marginal  product  of capital)  end  up  con-
strained in their access to capital. This, even
as other people earn a lower return on their
(more  abundant)  capital. In  agriculture,
land market failures mean that some farm-
ers  exert  too  little  effort  on  some  plots
(where  they  are  sharecropping), and  too
much  effort  on  other  plots  (which  they
own).12 Investment  in  human  capital  can
also  be  allocated  inefﬁciently, because  of
intrahousehold  disputes, because  credit-
constrained  households  lack  the  resources
to keep their children healthy and in school,
or because discrimination in the labor mar-
ket reduces the expected returns to school-
ing for some groups. What do such diverse
market  failures  have  in  common?  They
cause  differences  in  initial  endowments—
such  as  family  wealth, race, or  gender—to
make investment less efﬁcient.

There also are political and institutional
reasons why equity and efﬁciency are long-
term  complements. Markets  are  not  the
only  institutions  in  society. The  function-
ing of states, legal systems, and regulatory
agencies—indeed, of all  the  institutions
that assign and enforce property rights and
mediate conﬂicts among citizens—is inﬂu-
enced by the distribution of political power
(or inﬂuence, or voice) in society. Unequal
distributions of control over resources and
of political  inﬂuence  perpetuate  institu-
tions that protect the interests of the most
powerful, sometimes  to  the  detriment  of
the personal and property rights of others.13
Those  whose  rights  are  not  protected
have  little  incentive  to  invest, perpetuating
poverty  and  reproducing  inequality. Con-
versely, good  institutions  that  protect  and
enforce personal and property rights for all
citizens  have  led  to  higher  sustained  eco-
nomic  growth  and  long-term  prosperity.
Equity can, once again, help societies grow
and develop.

This  does  not mean, of course, that
efﬁciency-equity  tradeoffs  have  somehow
been  abolished.
In  some  cases, equity
enhancements bring immediate—as well as
long-run—beneﬁts  for  efﬁciency.
If we
reduce  discrimination  against  women  in

one  segment  of the  labor  market, such  as
management, and if this brings a new pool
of talent  into  that  segment, efﬁciency  is
likely to increase even in the short run.14 In
other cases, however, expanding the oppor-
tunity  sets  for  the  disadvantaged  may
require  more  costly  redistribution. To
ﬁnance  better-quality  schooling  for  those
who  have  the  least  educated  parents, and
who  attend  the  worst  schools, it  may  be
necessary  to  raise  taxes  on  other  people.
The basic economic insight that such taxa-
tion distorts incentives remains valid. Such
policies should be implemented only to the
extent that the (present) value of the long-
run  beneﬁts  of greater  equity  exceed  the
efﬁciency costs of funding them.15

The  point  is  that  some  of these  long-
term beneﬁts of pursuing greater equity are
ignored in the conceptual calculus of policy
design. The  fact  that  better-schooled  chil-
dren who are poor and from a racial minor-
ity will be more productive is usually taken
into  account. But  the  fact  that  they  may
acquire  greater  political  voice  and  help
make  social  institutions  more  inclusive—
which, in  turn, may  increase  the  stake  of
that  group  in  society, potentially  leading 
to  greater  trust,
less  conﬂict, and  more
investment—may not be. To the extent that
such  indirect  (but  important)  beneﬁts  of
equity-enhancing  policies  are  ignored, too
few of them are pursued—even assuming a
purely benevolent government.

By placing equity and fairness as central
elements of an efﬁcient development strat-
egy, developing countries will be better able
to  reach  sustainable  growth  and  develop-
ment  trajectories. Such  equitable  growth
paths are likely to lead to faster reductions
in the many dimensions of poverty, the cen-
tral objective of development everywhere.16
The second implication of the existence
of inequality traps is that no real-life policy
or  institution  is  entirely  exogenous: no
existing  organization  or  application  of a
policy  idea  has  been  implemented  on  a
purely  technocratic  basis. All  policies  and
institutions  exist  because  the  political  sys-
tem has brought them into being or allowed
them  to  survive. The  political  system
reﬂects the distribution of power and voice
attained at a particular time and place. This

distribution  is, in  turn, inﬂuenced  by  the
distribution  of wealth, income, and  other
assets  and  outcomes  in  that  society. Such
“circular  causality” for  wealth,
income,
social  and  cultural  capital, and  power,
mediated 
evolves
throughout time and history.

Acknowledging  history  and  social  and
political institutions is crucial to avoid pol-
icy  mistakes. But  a  fatalistic  view  of the
world is not only wrong, but also counter-
productive. To  propose  policies  without
understanding  history, or  the  speciﬁc  con-
text  for  developing  these  policies, often
leads to failure. But this acknowledgment is
not equivalent to the view that no policies
should be suggested at all. Such a view fails
to  recognize  how  purposeful  social  and
political action can achieve signiﬁcant pol-
icy  and  institutional  changes—and  would
result in fatalistic inaction.

History is not endlessly repetitive and, as
this report documents, many countries have
taken on the challenge of breaking inequality
traps  with  some  success. Groups  have  also
changed  their  circumstances  or  changed
social  and  political  institutions. Consider
the  civil  rights  movement  in  the  United
States,
the  democratic  overthrow  of
apartheid in South Africa, the more partici-
patory budgeting practices in some Brazil-
ian cities, and the reforms in access to land,
education, and  local  government  in  the
Indian  state  of Kerala. The  challenge  for
policy is to ask when and how such changes
can be supported.

Introduction

23

A brief preview of the Report
Part  I  summarizes  evidence  on  inequity
within and across countries. Part II asks why
equity matters for development, both intrin-
sically  and  instrumentally. Part  III  turns  to
the policy implications. If unequal opportu-
nities  and  absolute  deprivation  are  inimical
to long-term prosperity—as well as intrinsi-
cally objectionable—there is scope for policy
and institutional reform aimed at leveling the
economic and political playing ﬁelds.

An  equity  lens  and  the  focus  on  leveling
the playing ﬁeld add three basic points. First,
redistributions from richer and more power-
ful  groups  to  poorer  groups  that  face  more
limited  opportunities  are  sometimes  neces-
sary  and  should  be  pursued. Second, when
considering  policy  tradeoffs  between  equity
and efﬁciency, the full long-term beneﬁts of
equity—including  on  the  development  of
better and more inclusive institutions—need
to be taken into account. Third, all categories
of economic  policy—macro  and  micro—
have effects on both efﬁciency (and growth)
and  equity  (and  distribution). Because  our
ultimate  goal  is  the  reduction  of poverty
through  the  equitable  pursuit  of prosperity,
the  policy  suggestions  in  these  chapters  are
consistent with good poverty-reduction poli-
cies, which the World Bank has been advocat-
ing since at least the publication of the World
Development  Report  1990.17 These  sugges-
tions  are  also  in  line  with  the  2000  World
Development Report’s three pillars of oppor-
tunity, empowerment, and security.18

Palanpur 

Inequality traps stiﬂe economic development in a north Indian village
Villagers differ markedly from one another in the opportunities they have to improve their welfare and in their abilities to
use the assets and endowments available to them. Mirrored in village economic and social institutions—and in the politi-
cal processes for seeking change—these deep-seated inequalities have prevented the village from improving human devel-
opment and accelerating economic growth.

The village of Palanpur, in the north

Indian  state  of Uttar  Pradesh, has
been the subject of intensive study
by  a  group  of development  economists
between  the  late  1950s  and  early  1990s.1
Researchers  visited  the  village  repeatedly
and  collected  detailed  quantitative  and
qualitative information. While a single vil-
lage study covering a speciﬁc period of time
cannot  be  used  to  draw  inferences  about
development  in  rural  India  as  a  whole, it
does  provide  a  distinct  window  into  the
kind  of processes  that  can  shape  growth
and equity over time.

The  study  documents  modest  economic
progress  over  time  with  slow  growth  in  per
capita incomes and some declines in income
poverty. But alongside this sluggish growth is
evidence  of stagnation  and  even  deteriora-
tion along other dimensions of well-being.

Different  groups  of villagers, deﬁned  by
such  predetermined  characteristics  as  caste
or gender, face radically different opportuni-
ties for economic and social mobility. Their
economic  endowments  differ  markedly, as
do  their  education, health, occupational
mobility, and  capacity  to  inﬂuence  and
shape social and political institutions in the
village. Disadvantage  in  one  dimension  of
opportunity is generally reinforced by disad-
vantage  in  others, combined  in  a  way  that
perpetuate the stark inequities over genera-
tions.

investments  and 

These  deep-seated 

inequalities  of
opportunity shape, and are shaped by, mar-
ket imperfections in the village, resulting in
suboptimal 
impeding
growth. Inequalities  are  also  mirrored  in
village  institutions. State  and  central  gov-
ernment  policies  that  were  introduced  in
the village were inevitably ﬁltered through a
highly  unequal  distribution  of power  and
inﬂuence. Rather  than  stimulating  broad
economic and social progress, public policy
has  simply  reproduced  the  prevailing  pat-
terns of inequality.

largest  castes 

Caste
Caste  in  Palanpur  deﬁnes  opportunities
and determines the activities villagers pur-
sue, even independent of occupation, edu-
cation, and other standard household char-
acteristics. The  three 
in
Palanpur are Thakurs, Muraos, and Jatabs.
At  the  top  is  a  martial  caste  known  as
the  Thakurs, which  accounted  for  about  a
quarter of the population in 1993. Thakurs
are  disproportionately  represented  in  jobs
such as the army and police that accord well
with  their  martial  past. They  are  typically
averse  to  wage  employment  in  the  village,
because this would place them in a subordi-
nate  position. Alert  to  nonfarm  employ-
ment opportunities outside the village, they
are well placed to take advantage of them,
thanks  to  stronger  information  and  social
networks.

Just  below  the  Thakurs  is  a  cultivating
caste, the  Muraos, also  accounting  for  a
quarter of the population. Muraos are tra-
ditional cultivators who have continued to
specialize in agriculture. Very hardworking,
they  have  seen  a  rapid  rise  in  wealth  and
economic  status  in  the  village. While  they
may still not enjoy the same social status as
Thakurs, they have become more prosper-
ous  and  now  challenge  the  previously
unquestioned political and economic dom-
inance of the Thakurs.

At the bottom are the scheduled castes
known  as  Jatabs, accounting  for  12  per-
cent  of
the  population. Traditionally
“untouchable” leather  workers  who  now
engage  primarily  in  agricultural  wage
labor, Jatabs  have  not  seen  any  of the
social  mobility  of
the  Muraos. They
remain a caste apart, with little or no land,
poor  education, and  little  access  to  non-
farm  employment  outside  the  village.
Despite some slight improvement over the
years, Jatabs  continue  to  endure  many
forms  of discrimination, including  that
from government officials.

Gender
Gender  inequalities  in  Palanpur  are  pro-
nounced. In 1993 there were 84 females for
every  100  males, strikingly  lower  than  in
most parts of the world (where the ratio is
usually  greater  than  one). Child  mortality
rates  are  much  higher  among  girls  than
among  boys. As  the  researchers  reported,
“We  witnessed  several  cases  of infant  girls
who were allowed to wither away and die in
circumstances  that  would  undoubtedly
have prompted more energetic action in the
case of a male child.”2

Young  girls  leave  their  village  to  join
their husband’s family. Marriage is “the gift
of a  daughter.” In  the  new  household, the
girl  is  acutely  vulnerable  with  no  income-
earning opportunities, no property, no pos-
sibility  of returning  home  permanently.
Giving  birth  to  a  child  improves  her  sta-
tus—particularly  if it’s  a  boy. But  family
planning  practices  are  limited, leading  to
high fertility rates and short birth-spacing.
Repeated  pregnancies  take  an  enormous
toll  on  women’s  general  health  and  put
their lives at risk at the time of delivery. Old
age is strongly associated with widowhood,
in part because of the typically large age dif-
ference  between  husbands  and  wives. To
survive, widows  depend  overwhelmingly
on adult sons.

The participation of women in the labor
force in Palanpur is extremely low. Of 313
women age 15 or older in 1993, only 14 had
anything other than domestic work as their
primary or secondary occupation. This low
female participation in the labor force and
society, more generally, has extensive conse-
quences. For  example, the  survival  disad-
vantage of girls compared with boys tends
to  narrow  only  when  adult  women  have
wider  opportunities  for  gainful  employ-
ment. Similarly, the  virtual  exclusion  of
women  from  most  representative  institu-
tions in Palanpur has limited the focus and
quality of local politics and public action.

Schooling
Inequalities in education are wide, declining
only slowly. In the late 1950s, just under 20
percent of males age seven or older, and only
1 percent of females, were literate. By 1993,
male  literacy  had  risen  to  37  percent  and
female literacy to just below 10 percent. Yet
education is clearly of great value in Palan-
pur. Years of schooling strongly increase the
likelihood  that  an  individual  will  ﬁnd
employment in a regular job outside the vil-
lage. Among farmers, too, direct observation
strongly suggests that better-educated farm-
ers in Palanpur have been crucial in techno-
logical innovation and diffusion.

The perceived value of female education
is quite different from that for boys, because
girls  are  expected  to  spend  most  of their
adult life in domestic work. Although there
is  good  evidence  of the  beneﬁts  of educa-
tion  in  domestic  activities, it  is  not  clear
that the effects of maternal literacy on child
health, for example, are recognized. Even if
beneﬁts are correctly perceived, they might
not  be  of direct  interest  to  the  parents,
because  daughters  are  “transferred” from
the  village  when  they  marry. Those  who
bear  the  costs  of female  education  thus
share little in the beneﬁts.

The  upper-caste  Thakurs  have  a  view
(adopted by many others) that education is
not important or even suitable for the lower
castes. Blatant  forms  of discrimination
against children from disadvantaged castes
have  disappeared  from  the  schooling  sys-
tem, but  subtler  forms  of discrimination
have  remained—for  example, the  high-
caste  teacher  considered  any  form  of con-
tact  with  Jatab  children  as  “repulsive,”
which likely affected his or her rapport with
them and probably discouraged their atten-
dance.

Work
Occupational  divisions  in  Palanpur  have
widened as the village has shifted from an
overwhelmingly  agricultural  economy  to
one in which nonagricultural activities have
come to account for 30 to 40 percent of vil-
lage income. In 1957–58 some 13 villagers
(of 528) were employed in regular or semi-
regular nonfarm jobs. By 1993, this number
had  increased  more  than  four  times  to  57
jobs  (the  total  population  had  only  dou-
bled).

Outside jobs are associated with higher
and  more  stable  incomes, and  the  work  is

often less strenuous and demanding than in
agriculture. Access  to  nonfarm  jobs  is  far
from equal, however. Workers who wish to
obtain  a  regular  job  generally  have  to  pay
bribes  and, more  important, get  a  recom-
mendation or introduction from a friend or
relative. Such  rationing  by  personal  con-
tacts and inﬂuence implies that people with
low  social  status  tend  to  be  at  a  disadvan-
tage  in  the  competition  for  nonfarm  jobs,
even  for  given  education  levels, skills, and
endowments.

The  least  advantaged  segments  of the
labor  force  in  Palanpur  are  highly  repre-
sented  in  agricultural  wage  labor. Casual
wage labor in agriculture can be described
as a “last-resort” occupation, one taken up
by  those  who  have  no  signiﬁcant  alterna-
tive. Agricultural wage rates have risen over
time, but  slowly, and  there  are  prolonged
periods of seasonal unemployment.

Econometric  analysis  indicates  that—
controlling  for  a  large  number  of house-
hold  characteristics  (caste, demographic
characteristics, education,
land, and  so
on)—the  probability  of engagement  in
agricultural labor is 50 to 60 percent higher
for  households  that  had  engaged  in  this
occupation  a  decade  earlier. Occupational
inequalities thus result in income inequal-
ity, and they persist over long periods.

Incomes, assets, and liabilities
Per capita incomes in Palanpur have grown
at around 2 percent a year between 1957–8
and  1983–4  and  income  poverty  fell  from
around 47 to 34 percent during this period.
Incomes in the village are distributed about
as unequally as they are in India as a whole,
and  income  inequality  has  remained  rela-
tively stable over time.

An assessment of economic inequalities
based  on  wealth provides  a  different  pic-
ture. Ownership of durables has expanded,
and the value of land and other productive
assets has grown, implying a signiﬁcant rise
in  gross  wealth. But  there  has  also  been  a
dramatic  and  uneven  expansion  of liabili-
ties. Inequality  in  the  distribution  of net
wealth  has  widened  in  Palanpur  from  a
Gini of around 0.46 in 1962–3 to a conserv-
atively estimated 0.55 in 1990.

Many of the liabilities come from pub-
licly provided and subsidized credit sources
that  have  expanded  sharply  over  time, but
that  have  been  associated  with  pervasive
corruption. Disadvantaged groups, such as

Focus on Palanpur

27

the Jatabs, are the principal targets of fraud-
ulent  accounting  practices 
that  have
resulted  in  a  dizzying  accumulation  of
debts  and  dramatically  raised  the  cost  of
borrowing  for  such  households. Those
without access to cheap formal credit have
to  fall  back  on  private  moneylenders, at
high interest rates.

Collective inaction
The  different  bases  of social  division  in
Palanpur  have  led  to  multiple  solidarities
and  oppositions. The  village  society  is
highly  fragmented, with  few  solid  rallying
points for collective action, whether coop-
erative or adversarial. The limited reach of
collective action, in turn, is responsible for
some  of the  most  serious  failures  of its
development. For  example,
the  village
assembly  (panchayat)  is  constituted  every
few years, but it rarely meets. In 1984 it was
made  obligatory  that  at  least  one  woman
participant be selected, but in Palanpur she
is  never  consulted  and  has  never  attended
any  panchayat  meetings. All  decisions  and
responsibilities are effectively taken by a vil-
lage  headman, who  has  always  come  from
one of the privileged groups. There also is
ample scope for self-serving patronage and
fraud. Modern  arrangements  (elections,
reserved seats for low castes, and women on
the panchayat) have not profoundly altered
the elitist and nonparticipatory character of
local politics in the village.

The  dominance  of privileged  groups
over  collective  institutions  has  had  far-
reaching  consequences. Between  the  late
1950s  and  early  1990s, no  fewer  than  18
types  of government-provided  programs
were  introduced  to  the  village: a  public
works road-building program, free school-
ing, free basic health care, old-age pensions,
a  fair-price  shop, a  farmer’s  cooperative,
and  so  on. Most  of them  remained  non-
functional, particularly  when  there  was  a
redistributive  component. Only  programs
that enjoyed strong backing from the polit-
ically  advantaged 
in  the  village  were
allowed  to  succeed. The  authors  of the
study conclude, “There is little prospect of
major improvement in the orientation and
achievements  of government  intervention
without a signiﬁcant change in the balance
of political power, both at the state and at
the local level.”3

Inequity within countries:
individuals and groups

2c h a p t e r

and 

economically 

Across  the  world, individuals  and  groups
face  highly  unequal  opportunities  to  better
themselves 
socially.
Inequalities, as such, might not be of particu-
lar  concern  if outcomes  varied  for  reasons
that had to do mainly with individual efforts.
But, taking our cue from the ﬁrst chapter, we
are  concerned  here  with  systematic  differ-
ences  in  opportunities  for  individuals  and
groups  who  differ  only  in  skin  color, caste,
gender, or place of residence, predetermined
characteristics  that  can  be  argued  to  be
“morally irrelevant.” As illustrated in focus 1,
on the Indian village of Palanpur, when such
inequalities of opportunity are pronounced,
they are often reproduced over time and not
only affect welfare directly but also act to sti-
ﬂe  human  development  and  economic
growth.

On  the  basis  of what  predetermined
characteristics  should  groups  be  defined
such  that  we  would  not  want  to  see  sys-
tematic differences in their opportunities?
Clearly there is no single answer. Roemer
(1998) argues that society has to make this
choice  through  some  kind  of ethical  and
political process. The circumstances could
include  social  origin  variables  outside  an
individual’s control, such as sex, race, eth-
nicity, caste, parental education and occu-
pation, wealth, or place of birth. Cogneau
(2005)  notes  that  a  society’s  choice  of
circumstances  establishes  a  direct  link
between equality of opportunities and the
intergenerational  transmission  of out-
comes. In this chapter, we are largely com-
pelled  to  let  data  availability  dictate  the
group  definitions  we  consider. We  can
thus present only a partial, and often rudi-
mentary, picture  of
the  full  range  of
inequity  that  might  exist  in  a  country.
Because we wish not only to look within a

28

country but also to compare across coun-
tries, we  use  group  definitions  of broad
relevance.

Although  economic 

inequalities  are
clearly  part  of the  story, this  chapter  goes
beyond  incomes  to  emphasize  inequalities
in  key  dimensions  of opportunity, such  as
health, education, and  the  freedom  and
capacity  of people  to  participate  in  and
shape  society. There  is  a  special  concern
with  inequalities  that  tend  to  perpetuate
differences  across  individuals  and  groups
over  time, within  and  across  generations.
These  result  in  “inequality  traps” that  are
pervasive in many countries. Such inequal-
ity traps reinforce our concern with equity
on  intrinsic  grounds, but  they  can  also  be
particularly detrimental to the development
process, because  they  act  to  curtail  eco-
nomic dynamism.

A  key  objective  here  is  to  show  how
inequalities  combine,
interact, and  are
reproduced through interlinked economic,
political, and sociocultural processes. Indi-
viduals and groups differ markedly in their
power to influence these processes; indeed,
they differ even in their capacity to aspire
to  such  influence. The  report  emphasizes
that  such  “agency” is  a  dimension  of
opportunity, alongside  education, health,
and wealth. And inequalities of agency are
central  in  explaining  how  inequalities  of
opportunity  are  transmitted  over  time
(box 2.1).

This  chapter  presents  evidence  of a
high  degree  of inequality  of opportunity
in  many  developing  countries—inequali-
ties  manifest  in  a  variety  of dimensions,
such  as  health, education, and  income. It
then focuses on the specific dimension of
inequality  of power, or  agency. Through-
out 
that

the  chapter, we  emphasize 

inequalities  in  different  dimensions  can
interact  with, and  reinforce, one  another
over time. To highlight these connections,
we end by focusing on the specific case of
gender inequity.

Inequalities in health
Alongside  the  intrinsic  importance  of
health  as  a  dimension  of welfare, poor
health  can  directly  influence  an  individ-
ual’s  opportunities—his  or  her  earnings
capacity, performance at school, ability to
care for children, participation in commu-
nity  activities, and  so  on. This  important
instrumental  function  of health  implies
that  inequalities  in  health  often  translate
into  inequalities  in  other  dimensions  of
welfare. And  these  inequalities  are  repro-
duced  over  time. We  focus  here  on  chil-
dren, while recognizing that differences in
social status, wealth, and health also mat-
ter for adults.

Demographic and Health Survey (DHS)
data 
indicate  that  health  status  varies
sharply across population groups. To what
extent does it vary across population groups
deﬁned by characteristics that are predeter-
mined  and  arguably  have  no  moral  rele-
vance?  We  draw  on  DHS  data  from  60
countries  to  examine  how  the  health  of
children  varies  across  population  groups
deﬁned  by  mother’s  education, rural  or
urban residence, and parent’s economic sta-
tus, proxied by an index of household own-
ership of consumer durables. (We look fur-
ther  at  cross-country  differences  in  health
in chapter 3.)

Infant  mortality. For 
these  countries,
infant  mortality  rates  vary  markedly—
from  a  low  of around  25  per  1,000  live
births  in  Colombia  and  Jordan, to  more
than 125 in Mali, Niger, and Mozambique
(figure 2.1). But even where overall infant
mortality  rates  are  high, the  figures  for
children whose mothers have a secondary
education  or  higher  are  dramatically
lower. The  risk  of death  among  children
with  well-educated  mothers  in  Mali, for
example, is about the same as that for the
average child in Indonesia. And while the
overall  infant  mortality  rate  in  Brazil  lies

B O X   2 . 1 Unequal opportunities persist across generations

in Brazil

As a prelude to the themes in this chapter,
we describe one attempt to quantify the
level and persistence of inequalities of
opportunity in Brazil, based on nationally
representative household survey data. Brazil
was selected for a reason.With a Gini coefﬁ-
cient of per capita incomes just below 0.6
and persistent over time, it is generally per-
ceived to be one of the world’s most
unequal countries.*

Brazil’s main household survey, the

Pesquisa Nacional por Amostra de Domicilios
(PNAD), included in 1996 a set of
supplemental questions on the parents of
respondents.This permitted an analysis of
the intergenerational persistence in
inequalities. Using four circumstance vari-
ables (parental schooling, father’s occupa-
tion, race, and region of birth), Bourguignon,
Ferreira, and Menendez (2005) investigated
how inequalities of opportunity generate
inequality in current earnings across differ-
ent cohorts of adult individuals. Applying a
conceptual framework closely related to
that in chapter 1, they decomposed earn-
ings inequality into a lower bound compo-
nent attributable to the inequality of oppor-
tunity—to the effect of the four observed
circumstance variables—and a residual
component, which would account for per-
sonal effort, luck, measurement error, transi-
tory income, and other unobservable char-
acteristics.They found that the four
variables accounted for more than a ﬁfth of
the total earnings inequality within gender

cohorts. Of the four, family background was
most important.

This distribution of certain opportuni-

ties and outcomes has persisted across gen-
erations.When the authors estimated
econometrically the relationship between
schooling and race, region of origin,
parental education, and father’s occupation,
only the coefﬁcient on parental education
seems to have fallen across cohorts. In other
words, race, region of origin, and father’s
occupation continue to predict an individ-
ual’s education level. And even for educa-
tion, mechanisms are at work to reproduce
schooling levels across generations, espe-
cially at the lower end of the distribution.
Brazil underscores the need to look at a

range of outcomes (of which incomes are
only one, with education, health and services
also of great concern). It also underscores the
need to look at a range of processes—of
which income and economic wealth-based
mechanisms form only part, and for which
group-based interactions are as central as
household and individual conditions, behav-
iors, and characteristics.

(2005).
* The perception of particularly high inequality
in Brazil may to some extent be a result of the
way income is measured there. Alternative
approaches to measuring inequality, based on
other welfare indicators, indicate that Brazil
may be less of an outlier in Latin America than
previously believed. See box 2.5 and also De
Ferranti and others (2004).

below  50  (estimates  from  1996), the  rate
for children whose mothers have not been
educated is roughly twice as high. Further
analysis, not reported here, indicates that
infant mortality rates are also sharply differ-
entiated  across  population  groups  deﬁned
by rural-urban residence and economic sta-
tus, proxied by asset ownership.

Stunting. Another  dimension  of health,
extreme  stunting  (with  height-for-age
below  three  standard  deviations  from  the
reference population), also varies markedly
across  countries. Overall  rates  are  as  high 
as  30  percent  in  Pakistan  and  the  Rep-
ublic  of Yemen, but  negligible  in  Trinidad
and Tobago and very low in Jordan, Arme-
nia, Brazil, and  Kazakhstan  (ﬁgure  2.2).

The  difference  between  children  born  in
rural  and  urban  areas  can  be  dramatic,
particularly at higher overall stunting lev-
els. In  Guatemala, stunting  rates  for  chil-
dren in urban areas are around 10 percent,
but in rural areas they are as much as three
times higher. Children in Guatemala clearly
have  no  choice  in  deciding  whether  they
are born in the countryside or the city, but
their opportunities to achieve good health
are clearly much less assured in rural than
in  urban  areas. As  for  infant  mortality
rates, stunting  among  children  is  also
sharply  differentiated  by  mother’s  educa-
tion and household economic status.

access  to  health  services, proxied  here  as
having  received  at  least  one  of three  key
childhood vaccinations—bacille Calmette-
Guérin; diptheria, pertussis, and tetanus; or
measles  (ﬁgure  2.3). This  is  so  even  in
countries  where  the  overall  percentage  of
children without any coverage is as high as
40 percent. Conversely, children whose par-
ents  are  in  the  bottom  quintile  are  much
more  likely  to  lack  access  to  such  basic
health  care. In  Morocco, where  roughly  5
percent of children have not received even
one of these three vaccinations, the propor-
tion for children in the poorest quintile is
well above 15 percent.

Access to immunization. Children born in
families whose asset ownership places them
in  the  top  quintile  of the  distribution  of
economic status have a high probability of

High-impact  health  services. The  World
Bank  (2003j), drawing  on  DHS  data  from
30 low- and middle-income countries, ﬁnds
that  the  poor  are  considerably  less  likely

32

WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2006

than  the  non-poor  to  have  access  to  high-
impact health services, such as skilled deliv-
ery  care, antenatal  care, and  complemen-
tary feeding. Similarly, Wodon (2005) draws
on household survey data from 15 African
countries to indicate that, while virtually all
urban  households  are  within  one  hour’s
travel  time  to  a  health  center, the  propor-
tion in rural areas is generally only around
half, and  as  low  as  35–38  percent  in  Niger
and Ethiopia.

Disability. Data from a number of coun-
tries  suggest  that  disabled  people  are
much  more  likely  to  be  poor. Hoogeveen
(2003) reports that in Uganda the proba-
bility of poverty for urban dwellers living
in a household with a disabled head is 38
percent higher than for those who live in a
household with an able-bodied head. The
Serbian  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy
reports that 70 percent of disabled people
are  unemployed. In  a  study  drawing  on 
10  household  surveys  in  eight  countries,
self-reported  disability  was  found  to  be
more  correlated  with  nonattendance  at
school  than  other  characteristics, includ-
ing gender or rural residence.1 Sen (2004)
emphasizes that the disabled face not only
an “earnings  handicap,” associated  with  a
lower  probability  of employment  and
lower  compensation  for  their  work, but
also  a  “conversion  handicap.” By  this  he
means  that  a  physically  disabled  person
requires  more 
income  than  an  able-
bodied  person  to  achieve  the  same  living
standard.

Social  inequalities  damaging  health. Not
only  are  health  outcomes  correlated  with
inequalities in other dimensions, but such
social  inequalities  can  be  argued  to  be
detrimental  to 
individual  health  out-
comes.2 In  his  comprehensive  review  of
the  literature, Deaton  (2003)  argues  that,
while it is certainly plausible that various
inequalities (such as those in power) cause
bad health, it is not clear that inequality of
income  is  the  main  culprit. He  provides
evidence suggesting that, after controlling
for  an  individual’s  income,
income  in-
equality at the group level does not matter
independently for individual health. Thus,

the  main  inequalities  that  affect  health
may not be in the income space. He cites
examples  of other  key  dimensions  of
inequality:
land  ownership, women’s
agency (health and fertility in India), and
democratic  rights  (in  England  in  the
1870s and in the U.S. South in the 1960s).
In general, an individual’s rank in the rele-
vant  hierarchy  has  been  found  to  be  im-
portant  to  health  in  animal  and  human
experiments. Repeated  stress  associated
with  insults  and  the  lack  of control  that
comes from low rank has a well-developed
biochemical basis.3

The  consequences  of poor  health  are
reﬂected  in  education  achievements, eco-
nomic  prosperity, and  future  generations.
Consider  the  plight  of AIDS  orphans  in
southern  Africa, the  stark  inequalities  of
opportunity they face, and the possible role
for public action (box 2.2).

insights 

DHS  data  (figures  2.1–2.3)  provide
detailed 
into  the  relationship
between  inequalities  in  health  and  some
key  circumstance  variables. But  they  are
not  particularly  well  suited  to  capturing
the contribution of detailed spatial factors,
such as place of birth, in overall inequality,
because of the limited sample size. In one
attempt to get around this problem, child
height  in  Cambodia  was  estimated  at  the
commune level based on a statistical pro-
cedure to combine DHS data with popula-
tion  census  data.4 The  study  documents
considerable heterogeneity across Cambo-
dia’s  more  than  1,600  communes  in  the
prevalence  of stunting  and  being  under-
weight  among  children  under  the  age  of
five  (figure  2.4). The  analysis  provides
clear  evidence  that  in  Cambodia  a  child’s
opportunities  for  good  health  have  a
strong  spatial  dimension  to  them. Yet
clearly, no  child  is  able  to  determine  in
which locality he or she is born.

Trends
Average health in most countries improved
in  the  twentieth  century  (chapter  3).
Deaton  (2004)  documents  that  improve-
ments in health are likely to have accom-
panied  economic  growth, but  he  also
emphasizes  the  globalization  of knowl-
edge, facilitated  by  local  political, eco-

B O X   2 . 2 Unequal assets, unequal opportunities: AIDS orphans in Southern Africa

It is hard to imagine people with fewer assets,
through absolutely no fault of their own,than
AIDS orphans.Left to fend for themselves on the
death of one or both parents from a progressively
debilitating,heavily stigmatized,and costly-to-
treat disease,their plight would be of concern
even if they numbered but a few.In southern
Africa,however,the United Nations Children’s Fund
(UNICEF) estimates that there were 12.3 million
AIDS orphans in 2003,a veritable demographic
group in their own right.By 2010,UNICEF projects
that there will be 1.5 million AIDS orphans in
South Africa; by 2014,1 million in Zambia.

An entire generation of Africans is emerging

who will have been raised, if they are lucky, by
grandparents or extended family members
(themselves likely to be impoverished,
overwhelmed, and suffering from the disease).
At worst, they will grow up in child-headed
households or in situations in which their basic
rights to food, clothing, shelter, and adequate
care are routinely denied.

Wills and schooling
Beginning to overcome the huge disadvantages
that AIDS orphans start life with requires special
attention on numerous fronts (box 7.11 consid-
ers a variety of policy options). From a legal
standpoint, parents who know their death is
imminent and who have young children need to
be encouraged (even if they are illiterate) to pre-
pare enforceable wills that will protect the inher-
itance rights of their children to ensure that sur-
viving adults do not just forcibly take their land,

savings, or other valuables. From an education
standpoint, it is vital to keep children in school,
where the acquisition of even basic skills can
give them some viable prospect of being able to
move out of poverty.Where a child is the head of
a household and perhaps its sole income earner,
however, the pressures to drop out of school are
enormous. Numerous studies document signiﬁ-
cantly higher dropout rates of AIDS orphans. In
Kenya, one extreme example found that “52 per-
cent of the children orphaned by AIDS were not
in school, compared to 2 percent of non-
orphans”(UNAIDS 2002, 135).

Attending school is also important from a
civic perspective: it socializes children into the
norms and mores of society, and gives them the
conﬁdence and capacity to participate more
fully in it.Without such socialization, vulnerable
young children are easy targets for those offer-
ing them security and status through member-
ship in a street gang, criminal network, or militia
movement. If AIDS orphans continue to stay
from school at their current rate, comments one
senior U.N. ofﬁcial,“you will have a society where
kids haven’t been to school and therefore can’t
fulﬁll even basic jobs...a society where a large
proportion can have antisocial instincts because
their lives have been so hard.You [will] have a
generation of children who will be more vulnera-
ble to exploitation and to disease because they
won’t have the same sense of self-worth”(cited
in Fleshman 2001, 1). Such children face the dis-
mal prospect of failing to accumulate assets
because of the extreme burdens thrust on them

in their most formative years and the paucity of
opportunities available to them thereafter.

Avoiding infection
The most immediate priority,however,is ensuring
that AIDS orphans do not themselves become
infected with the disease,thereby increasing the
likelihood that they will perpetuate the cycle.AIDS
orphans face precisely such a risk,however,
because the stigma of HIV/AIDS means that people
often assume that the children of parents who died
from AIDS must be infected,shunning,shaming,or
exploiting them accordingly.Some AIDS orphans
have even been denied access to schools and
health clinics because of the fear their very
presence generates.Children grieving the loss of a
parent are also vulnerable to the sexual predations
of those putatively claiming to offer them comfort.
Indeed,the desperation and apparent hopeless-
ness of their circumstances—all the more so if it
coincides with a natural disaster such as drought—
can drive AIDS orphans into prostitution.

The plight of AIDS orphans provides a

graphic illustration of how cycles of disadvantage
can perpetuate themselves, and how social isola-
tion and exclusion (especially at a young age) can
preclude the acquisition of assets and undermine
the capacity to sustain participation in the insti-
tutions that provide the best path out of poverty.

nomic, and educational conditions. In the
1980s  and  1990s, however, progress
slowed—a  result  of the  worldwide  HIV/
AIDS epidemic and rises in cardiovascular
mortality  in  Eastern  Europe  and  former
Soviet Union countries.

How have inequalities in health evolved
within countries? Data from DHS provide
some clues. For a subset of countries, mul-
tiple  rounds  of DHS  data  are  available  to
document changes in infant mortality over
time. Of some 36 “spells” of health change
that could be identified, roughly 25 corre-
sponded  to  improved  health  outcomes  in
the  form  of lower  infant  mortality  rates.
Although overall health improved in these
25 cases, the gaps between urban and rural
areas, between groups defined by mother’s
education, and between groups defined by
durable  asset  ownership  did  not  univer-
sally decline alongside the overall declines

B O X   2 . 3 Health improvements and greater health equity

in Peru

Paxson and Schady (2004), drawing on mul-
tiple rounds of DHS data, document the
declining infant mortality rate in Peru
between the late 1970s and late 1990s. A
general downward trend exhibited a sharp
setback during the major economic crisis
between 1988 and 1992, but resumed after
the crisis.The downward trend remained
evident even after adjusting for age of
mother, recall period, education, and urban
status—indicating that the overall trend
decline in infant mortality was not attributa-
ble only to general improvements in educa-
tion, an aging population, or urbanization. In
addition, the fact that infant mortality rose
sharply around 1990, even after these
adjustments, supports the notion that the
decrease in household income and the col-
lapse of public expenditures on health as a
result of the crisis were important.

Infant mortality rates in Peru varied

markedly with the education level of the
mother in late 1970s and the 1980s (see ﬁg-
ure below). During the economic crisis,
increases in mortality were largest among
infants born to women with less education.
After the crisis, the gap between infant mor-
tality rates associated with different mater-
nal education levels declined steadily, sug-
gesting an overall decline in inequality in
mortality alongside the decline in overall
mortality rates.

There is some support for the view that
changes in the amount and composition of
public expenditures on social programs
drove these improvements. Real total
expenditures increased two and a half times
between 1991 and 2000, and such public
spending did not bypass the poor.

in  infant  mortality.5 The  improvements  in
health were not necessarily shared across all
groups in the population.

As  Cornia  and  Menchini  (2005)  note,
mortality  differentials  across  groups  tend
to  narrow  with  an  improvement  of the
average  only  if policies  focus  explicitly  on
equity. Without  such  a  focus,
improve-
ments  in  the  average  may  not  translate  to
declining  group  differences. For  example,
in the United States between the 1950s and

1990s, the  overall  decline  in  the  infant
mortality rate to 7.9 in 1994 was accompa-
nied by an increase in the ratio of black to
white  infant  mortality  rates  from  1.6  in
1950  to  2.2  in  1991. Inequality  in  health
does  not  inevitably  fall  as  overall  health
improves, but  such  a  virtuous  process  is
possible (box 2.3).

Inequalities in education
Education  is  of great  intrinsic  importance
when assessing inequalities of opportunity.
It is also an important determinant of indi-
viduals’ income, health  (and  that  of their
children), and capacity to interact and com-
municate with others. Inequalities in educa-
tion thus contribute to inequalities in other
important dimensions of well-being.

Measuring  inequality  in  education  is
not  easy. Census  and  survey  data  in  most
countries can generally yield statistics on,
for  example, years  of schooling. But  such
information  does  not  capture  well  the
quality  of education  and  how  that  might
vary  across  individuals. Nor  is  it  easy  to
compare  years  of schooling  across  coun-
tries, because  those  years  might  mean
something quite different from country to
country.

Test results. Despite the measurement difﬁ-
culties, there  is  considerable  evidence  of
inequalities of opportunity in education in
the  developing  world. Consider  the  differ-
ences  in  test  performance  among  Ecuado-
rian  children  ages  three  to  six  years  across
population  groups  deﬁned  by  parental
education, region  of residence, and  wealth
(box 2.4).

Test  results  among  very  young  children
capture  well  the  inequality  in  opportunity
in education, but such data are not readily
available  for  large  numbers  of developing
countries. So we look instead at the percent-
age of household heads with no education
by gender and by urban-rural residence.

Male  and  female  household  heads. The
overall  percentage  of household  heads
without any education varies dramatically
across  our  sample  of 60-odd  countries
(figure 2.5). In the high-income countries,
the  percentage  rates  are  negligible. But  at

the  other  extreme, in  Burkina  Faso  and
Mali, for example, the overall percentage is
more  than  80  percent. What  is  similarly
striking is that, in most countries, the likeli-
hood that the household head is uneducated
is  dramatically  higher  than  average  when
she is a woman. In the Laos People’s Demo-
cratic  Republic, for  example, although  the
overall percentage of household heads with
no education is about 20 percent, the rate is
closer  to  70  percent  for  female  household
heads.

Rural  and  urban  household  heads. Simi-
lar patterns can be observed for rural and
urban areas (figure 2.6). In general, house-
hold heads are far more likely to have no
education  when  they  are  based  in  rural
areas  than  in  urban  areas. Even  in  coun-
tries where the overall percentage without
education  is  very  high, the  rate  in  urban
areas can be dramatically lower. For exam-
ple, in Burundi, the percentage of house-
hold  heads  with  no  education  in  urban
areas  compares  with  the  national  average
in  Mexico, the  Dominican  Republic, and
Brazil.

Access to teachers. A recent study of primary
schools  and  health  clinics  in  Bangladesh,
Ecuador, India, Indonesia, Peru, and Uganda
has  identiﬁed  teacher  absenteeism  as  an
important, common, problem. The  study
found  that  higher  income  areas  generally
have 
lower  teacher  absentee  rates  than
poorer areas.6 It also found that higher paid
teachers, generally more educated and expe-
rienced, appear equally or more likely to be
absent  than  contract  or  less  remunerated
instructors, perhaps  because  these  instruc-
tors sense a lower risk of being ﬁred for their
absence. And although salaries in rural areas
were  often  higher  than  in  urban  areas,
teacher  attendance  in  these  areas  was  typi-
cally lower than in urban areas. In most sur-
veyed countries, the quality of infrastructure
and the frequency of monitoring appeared to
contribute to lower absenteeism.

B O X   2 . 4 Child test scores in Ecuador: the role of wealth,

parental education, and place of residence

That education achievements vary
markedly by population groups—and that
this can have profound implications—is
brought out forcefully in a recent study by
Paxson and Schady (2005).They show that
cognitive development of Ecuadorian chil-
dren ages three to six years, as measured by
a test of vocabulary recognition (TVIP),
varies signiﬁcantly depending on the
wealth of their household, their place of res-
idence, the education of their mother, and
that of their father.The extent to which
these circumstance variables are associated
with performance on cognitive tests is typi-
cally more pronounced for the older
children in their sample.

These socioeconomic characteristics

are significantly associated with cognitive
development even after controlling for
child health and home environment. The
researchers point to the striking evidence
that, in Ecuador, the youngest children,
irrespective of wealth quintile or educa-
tion of their parents, perform broadly as
well as their comparators. But as children
in Ecuador get older, their cognitive devel-
opment, relative to this benchmark, falters
significantly. Only children in the top half
of the wealth distribution and with highly
educated parents maintain their perform-
ance relative to their comparators. By the
time they are six years old, most children
in the sample are so far behind in their
cognitive development that it is uncertain
whether and how they could ever catch
up.

cation  and  to  assess  how  much  overall
inequality of education can be attributed to
mean  differences  between “morally  irrele-
vant” groups. Araujo, Ferreira, and Schady
(2004)  ﬁnd  that  the  inequality  of adult
education, measured by years of schooling
for 124 countries, can be pronounced. They
also ﬁnd that it is strongly (and inversely)
correlated  with  mean  years  of schooling
across countries.7

The data assembled by these authors also
indicate that the inequality of education for
speciﬁc  subgroups  of the  population  can
change. While  female  schooling  achieve-
ments  relative  to  male  achievements  were
dramatically lower among the oldest cohorts,

Asia, and to a lesser extent the Middle East

strikingly  in  the  Middle  East  and  North
Africa  and  in  Eastern  Europe  and  Central

been little, if any, change. The (urban-rural)
between-group  contribution  to  inequality
in this region has hovered at around 30 per-
cent across all the cohorts examined.

Economic inequalities
An  individual’s  consumption, his  or  her
income, or  his  or  her  wealth  have  all  been
used  as  indicators  of the  command  of an

individual over goods and services that can
be  purchased  in  the  market  and  that  con-
tribute directly to well-being. It is clear too,
that individuals’ economic status can deter-
mine and shape in many ways the opportu-
nities they face to improve their situations.
Economic well-being can also contribute to
improved  education  outcomes  and  better
health care. In turn, good health and good
education are typically important determi-
nants of economic status.

An  ideal  measure  of economic  well-
being  for  assessing  inequality  will  capture
an individual’s long-term economic status.
But it is difﬁcult to produce such a compre-
hensive indicator accurately. In practice, it is
common to work with measures of current
income  or  consumption  compiled  from
household survey data. While consumption

and income inequality are expected to cor-
relate reasonably well with long-term well-
being, it  is  unclear  exactly  how  well  they
actually do. And different measures of eco-
nomic  welfare—based  on  income, con-
sumption, or  wealth—can  yield  quite  dif-
ferent  assessments  of inequality  (see  also

For  example, Sudjana  and  Mishra

that  wealth  inequality  in  Indonesia  is  far
more concentrated than suggested by com-
parable ﬁgures based on consumption (ﬁg-

the stock market capitalization in Indonesia
was  controlled  by  10  families. This  is  in
stark  contrast  to  neighboring  countries,
such  as  Singapore  and  Malaysia, but  it  is

B O X   2 . 5 Beware of intercountry comparisons of inequality!

Because countries differ in their data collection
systems, cross-country data on economic
inequality are generally based on a variety of
indicators that are treated interchangeably.The
lack of a uniform basis for measuring economic
inequality in different countries has serious
implications for comparability.

One of the main sources of noncomparabil-

ity of inequality is that some countries use
household income as indicator of well-being
while others use consumption expenditures
(Atkinson and Brandolini 2001).These two indi-
cators capture different aspects of economic
welfare, with the former perhaps seen better as
a measure of welfare opportunity and the latter
as a measure of welfare achievement. In most
countries, measured inequality based on
income is higher than if it is based on consump-
tion. But this is not inevitable, and the degree to
which the two indicators disagree varies from
country to country (see table to the right).

The problem of comparability is not

conﬁned to the choice of welfare indicator. An
important but underappreciated additional
issue is that, even for a given indicator, its deﬁni-
tion varies considerably across countries and
even within countries over time. Consumption
inequality based on different deﬁnitions of con-
sumption can vary markedly, and will depend
on a variety of factors, including the following:

• The length of the recall period over which

consumption is recorded.

• The degree of disaggregation of consump-

tion items.

• The methods for imputation of housing and

durables consumption.

Similarly, income inequality can vary depending
on whether income—

Is intended to capture pre- or post-tax income,
Includes actual and implicit transfers, and

•
•
• Refers to full income or earnings only.

Additional factors confounding comparabil-

ity include differences in survey nonresponse
rates across countries (which are likely to affect
measured inequality—see Korinek, Mistiaen,
and Ravallion forthcoming). Differences across
countries in the availability of spatial price
indexes can also affect conclusions.Thomas
(1987) demonstrates that adjusting for spatial
price variation can affect conclusions about the
degree of income or consumption inequality.
Across countries there tends to be little unifor-
mity in whether, and how, spatial price variation
is accommodated.

Cross-country datasets on economic

inequality generally incorporate some attempts
to improve comparability, but they typically fall
far short of achieving strict comparability.With-
out a concerted effort to harmonize data collec-
tion across countries, it is unlikely that such
global databases can be relied on to provide
more than a tentative picture of differences in
inequality across countries.

only  marginally  higher  than  the  ﬁgure  for
the Philippines. More generally, Davies and
Shorrocks  (2005)  report  estimates  pub-
lished  by  Merrill  Lynch  and  Forbes  that
some 20 percent of the world’s millionaires
come from the developing world. Similarly,
Morck, Stangeland, and Yeung (2000) ﬁnd
a higher ratio of billionaire wealth to gross
domestic product (GDP) in Latin America
and the Caribbean, and East Asia, but not
India and South Africa (see chapters 6 and
9  for  further  discussion). These  ﬁgures
imply that the distribution of wealth may,
on average, be more concentrated in devel-
oping  countries  than  in  the  developed.
When  wealth  is  associated  with  political
inﬂuence, such  inequalities  also  translate
into  political  capture  and  can  provide  a
window  on  this  added  dimension  of
opportunity.

Bearing in mind the warnings offered in
box 2.5, ﬁgure 2.9 provides an approximate

picture of how economic inequality is dis-
tributed across countries. The highest levels
of recorded  inequality  occur  in Africa, the
second  highest  in  Latin  America. But  in-
equality  measures  for  Latin America  come
largely  from  income  data, while  those  in
other  regions, such  as  South  Asia, come
mainly from consumption data. As box 2.5
illustrated, income  data  tend  to  produce
higher measured inequality. Within regions,
the  data  suggest  that  inequality  can  vary
markedly  between  countries: consumption
inequality in South Africa is extremely high,
while in Mauritius it is lower even than in
OECD countries.

How  much  overall  economic  inequality
within  countries  is  attributable  to  differ-
ences  across  population  groups?  Unlike
health  and  education  inequalities, the  sys-
tematic decomposition of income inequal-
ity by population groups has long been sub-
ject to analysis in the economics literature.

These  decomposition  exercises  seek  to
understand what share of inequality can be
attributed  to  differences  between  groups
and what to inequality within groups. There
are  several  attractions  to  studying  certain
population groups in this way and to com-
paring ﬁndings across countries.

Our interest here is to deﬁne groups by
circumstances  we  might  consider “morally
irrelevant,” thereby  gaining  a  window  on
the  importance  of inequality  of opportu-
nity  in  the  economic  sphere. Additionally,
decomposition results generally are far less
sensitive  to  differences  in  deﬁnitions  of
underlying  welfare

measured levels of inequality. In that sense,
some of the difﬁculties with cross-country
comparisons described in box 2.5 are atten-
uated by subgroup decompositions.

Between-group shares 
of total inequality
While the “between-group” share of overall
inequality is an appealing indicator of the
salience of differences across groups in the
overall  assessment  of inequality, there  are
concerns  about  its  interpretation.8 In  par-
ticular, empirical  measures  of between-
group  shares  are  generally  found  to  be
quite low (see ﬁgures 2.10 and 2.11).9 The
conventional  presentation  of between-
group inequality is relative to total inequal-
ity. Elbers and others (2005), however, note
that  total  inequality  can  be  viewed  as  the
between-group  inequality  that  would  be
observed if every household in the popula-
tion  constituted  a  separate  group. Clearly,
against  such  a  benchmark, one  would
rarely  observe  a  high  share  of between-
group inequality.

Elbers  and  his  colleagues  propose  an
alternative, comparing  the  actual  between-
group  inequality  with  the  maximum  possi-
ble  inequality  that  would  be  obtained  by
keeping the number of groups and their sizes
at actual levels. For example, an assessment
of the contribution of gender differences to
inequality  compares  actual  between-gender
inequality  with  the  hypothetical  between-
gender inequality that would be obtained by
sorting  the  income  distribution  so  that  all
males  appeared  at  one  end  of the  distribu-
tion  and  all  females  at  the  other. This  ratio
provides  a  measure  of how  far  actual
between-group  inequality  lies  below  the
maximum between-group inequality that is
feasible  given  the  existing  conﬁguration  of
groups.

Economic  inequality  can  be  decom-
posed in a large sample of countries based
on  several  population  breakdowns, two  of
which  are  presented  in  ﬁgures  2.10  and
2.11: social group and education of house-
hold head. Such decompositions can follow
the  conventional  decomposition  method-
ology, complemented  by  the  Elbers  and
others  (2005)  measure  of feasible  group
decomposition.

Different  population  breakdowns  con-
tribute  to  differing  extents  to  overall
inequality. In general, the conventional cal-
culation  of the  between-group  contribu-
tion points to a fairly low share attributable
to between-group differences. But in some
countries  even  the  conventional  share  is

high. For  example,
in  Paraguay, when
inequality is decomposed between groups
by language spoken at home, the conven-
tional  between-group  share  is  approxi-
mately  30  percent  (figure  2.10). And
when  inequality  is  decomposed  for  five
broad  education  groups  in  Guatemala,

42

WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2006

the  between-group  contribution  is  above
40 percent (ﬁgure 2.11).

In  most  countries, the  between-group
share  is  noticeably  higher  for  decomposi-
tions based on the alternative, “feasible” cal-
culation. Based on this approach, observed
between-group differences are indeed sub-
stantial  in  many  countries—for  the  group
deﬁnitions here. To the extent that these cir-
cumstances are judged “morally irrelevant,”
the  ﬁndings  suggest  that  in  economic  life,
just as in health and education, a substantial
portion  of observed  inequality  in  many
developing  countries  can  be  linked  to
inequalities of opportunity.

Spatial differences
As with inequalities in health, conventional
survey data cannot say much about the con-
tribution  of ﬁnely  detailed  spatial  hetero-
geneity to overall inequality—because of the
limited sample size. In an exercise analogous
to that for health in Cambodia (ﬁgure 2.4), a
variety  of studies  have  applied  statistical
techniques  to  combine  survey  data  with
population census data to produce tentative
estimates  of inequality  at  the  community
and district levels. Elbers and others (2004)
document  the  contribution  to  overall  esti-
mated  inequality  of differences  in  mean
consumption  for  subdistricts  in  Ecuador,
Madagascar,
and  Mozambique. They
demonstrate  that  the  between-subdistrict
contribution  to  total  estimated  inequality
ranges from a low of 22 percent in Mozam-
bique  to  more  than  40  percent  in  Ecuador
(table  2.1). Based  on  a  similar  approach,
World Bank (2004e) reports between-com-
mune  differences  in  Morocco, accounting
for  40  percent  of overall  estimated  con-
sumption  inequality. The  general  impres-
sion is that spatial differences across locali-

inequality  as  the  number  of
increases. The  analysis  conﬁrms  that  for
some  countries  the  spatial  dimension  of
inequality  is  of considerable  importance.
This  conclusion  carries  over  even  more
powerfully  at  the  global  level, where  the
between-country  contribution  to  global
inequality is dramatic (chapter 3).

Other  studies  and  methodologies  cor-
roborate the ﬁnding that spatial differences
within countries are important. Using farm-
household  data  for  rural  China, Jalan  and
Ravallion  (1997)  identify  “spatial  poverty
traps,” where poorer areas have lower provi-
sions  of essential  public  goods  (such  as
roads)  and, as  a  result, households  in  the
area experience lower productivity on their
investments. Various  studies  ﬁnd  spatial
effects  on  living  standards, even  after  con-
trolling for nongeographic household char-
acteristics. Ravallion  and  Wodon  (1999)
demonstrate  that  place  of residence  is  an
important  determinant  of poverty 
in
Bangladesh. They also note that important
spatial  differences  can  be  discerned  even
within urban areas—households in the dis-
trict of Dhaka are markedly better off than
their counterparts in other urban districts.
Many  studies  suggest  that  spatial  differ-
ences  in  incomes  are  driven  by  policy. In
China, Kanbur  and  Zhang  (2001)  ﬁnd  a
measurable polarization between inland and
coastal  regions  where  factors  unrelated  to
physical geography—development of heavy
industry  in  certain  provinces, trade  open-
ness, and government investment in coastal
regions—are  associated  with  widening
interregional inequality. Escobal and Torero
(2003) compare coastal Peru with the high-
lands and ﬁnd that average per capita expen-
ditures vary markedly and that this variance
is  associated  with  fewer  and  weaker  infra-
structure services in the highlands.

The  role  of infrastructure  is  thus  central.
Although it is not disputed that physical geog-
raphy can also inﬂuence poverty directly, the
association between geographic variation in
poverty  and  geographic  variation  in  infra-
structure access is typically strong. Accord-
ingly,
it  is  argued  that  the  inﬂuence  of

The relationship between group
differences and inequality
As  is  clear  from  the  discussion  here, our
interest in the contribution of group differ-
ences  to  total  inequality  extends  beyond
normative  considerations  of fairness  and
justice. Differences between groups are also
thought  to  explain  overall  inequality  out-
comes, particularly  the  reproduction  of
inequalities over time. The basic idea is that
between-group  differences

inequality, for example, will tend also to be
mirrored  in  between-group  differences  in
health  and  education  inequalities—and  in
the  agency  of groups  in  inﬂuencing  their
circumstances (see below). These group dif-
ferences  will  then  reinforce  one  another.
Group  differences  in  education, for  exam-
ple, will

incomes and in political voice and partici-
pation. These  inequalities  will,
in  turn,
affect  health  inequalities  between  groups,
which are passed on to education inequali-
ties  and  so  on. “Inequality  traps” are  the
result. A corollary of this idea is that efforts
to moderate overall inequality levels might
require a focus on reducing between-group
differences.

It is difﬁcult to systematically document
this instrumental role of group differences.
Figure 2.12 illustrates one attempt. Overall
inequality  is  correlated  with  the  between-
group share for the sample of countries in
ﬁgures 2.10 and 2.11, controlling for region
and whether the underlying welfare indica-
tor  is  income  or  consumption. Nothing  in
the  mechanics  of
the  calculation  forces
overall inequality to be correlated with the
share attributable to between-group differ-
ences. Yet, for  this  sample  of countries,
higher overall inequality is associated with a
larger  between-group  share  of overall
inequality, which  is  attributable  to  the
rural-urban  breakdown,
to  differences
across social groups, to differences in edu-
cation, and (weakly) to differences in broad
occupation class of the household head.11

the between component of inequality across gender and age of the household head, and regions within the country
were not signiﬁcant.

One  interpretation  of these  ﬁndings  is
that between-group differences account for,
and possibly explain, a non-negligible por-
tion of overall inequality. This is consistent
with the broader theme of this report: that
group  differences  reinforce  one  another
and  in  this  way  contribute  to  the  replica-
tion of inequality over time. But these sim-
ple  correlations, while  suggestive, could
also be pointing to other processes and on
their own cannot exclude other competing
explanations.

Inequality and growth, economic
structure, and trade
Systematic  exploration  of the  impact  of
between-group shares on overall inequality
has  not, to  date, been  a  major  topic  of
empirical  investigation. A  longer-standing
question 
in  economics  has  been  how
inequality  evolves  with  economic  growth
more generally. Pioneering work by Kuznets

amount of empirical work on this question,

B O X   2 . 6 Revisiting the Kuznets hypothesis for economic growth and inequality

The starting point of the literature linking eco-
nomic development and income inequality
dates to the well-known works of two Nobel
Prize winners,W. Arthur Lewis (1954) and Simon
Kuznets (1955). Lewis, in his classic 1954 article
“Economic Development with Unlimited Sup-
plies of Labor,” developed a theoretical model in
which growth and accumulation in a dual econ-
omy would start in the modern industrial sector,
where capitalists would hire at a given wage
and reinvest a share of their proﬁts.The number
of traditional agricultural laborers willing to
move to this high-productivity, high-wage sec-
tor was assumed to be unlimited. In this process
of development, and as long as these assump-
tions would prevail, inequality in the
distribution of income would increase as aver-
age incomes rose.There would be a turning
point after which inequality would fall again as
the surplus labor phase ends and the dualistic
economy becomes a single-sector, fully industri-
alized economy.

Although Kuznets did not explicitly model
the intersectoral shifts of population as part of
the development process, he did build on them
to articulate his basic idea of an inverted-U rela-
tionship between economic growth and income
inequality (the “Kuznets curve”). In his presiden-
tial address at the Annual Meeting of the Ameri-
can Economic Association in 1954, he hypothe-
sized that in the process of growth and
industrialization, inequality would ﬁrst increase,
because of the shift from agriculture and the
countryside to industry and the city, and then
decrease as returns across sectors equalized.The
data Kuznets used to make this statement came

from a long-run series of inequality indicators
for England, Germany, and the United States,
and from a single observation in time for three
developing countries—India, Ceylon (Sri Lanka
today), and Puerto Rico.These were the data
available at that time, and Kuznets was well
aware of the limitations of the empirical backing
of his argument, in his own words, on “5 percent
of empirical information and 95 percent specu-
lation, some of it possibly tainted by wishful
thinking.”

Kuznets based his speculation primarily on
longitudinal data and called for in-depth case
studies of the economic growth of nations. But
many subsequent studies simply used
aggregate cross-country data (often of not par-
ticularly high quality) and reduced-form models
to explore and support the hypothesis of an
inevitable tradeoff between development and
equality.The Kuznets curve became one of the
most quoted stylized facts of the study of
income distribution for nearly four decades.

Cross-country data can be misleading 
for dynamic processes
With the development of much larger data sets,
such as the Deininger and Squire (1996) interna-
tional inequality database (following on from
Fields 1989), empirical “tests” of the Kuznets
curve were widely conducted. But it has become
understood that the use of cross-country data
to analyze what are essentially dynamic
processes can be strongly misleading. Moreover,
numerous studies have shown that the
evidence in favor of the Kuznets curve is not at
all robust to econometric speciﬁcations, sample

composition, and period of observation. See,
among others, Bourguignon and Morrisson
(1989), Fields and Jakubson (1994), Deininger
and Squire (1998), and Bruno, Ravallion, and
Squire (1998). Bruno, Ravallion, and Squire
(1998), while drawing in part on cross-country
data, also analyzed one country—India—for
which relatively long time-series data had
become available, and again found no sign that
growth increased inequality.

Why the Kuznets curve does not hold in prac-

tice probably has to do with the fact that devel-
oping countries do not generally satisfy the
assumptions on migration processes and sectoral
development underlying the Kuznets hypothesis.
To explain international differences in inequality
of incomes, it is important that the link between
economic inequalities and other factors, such as
economic dualism, land, education, and regional
differences, be more carefully analyzed.

No straightforward relationship between
income and inequality
To conclude, there is today something of a con-
sensus that no straightforward relation between
income and inequality can be established. As
argued by Kanbur (2000) in his exhaustive
review of the Kuznets curve literature in the
Handbook of Income Distribution: “it seems to us
far better to focus directly on policies, or combi-
nation of policies, which will generate growth
without adverse distributional effects, rather
than rely on the existence or nonexistence of an
aggregative, reduced form relationship between
per capita income and inequality.”

consensus  on  a  systematic  relationship
between the long-term growth processes of
industrialization  and  urbanization—and
overall inequality (box 2.6).

Cross-country studies have also analyzed
the relationship between inequality and eco-
nomic  structure. Bourguignon  and  Morri-
son (1990), for example, argue that “develop-
ing  countries  which  are  comparatively
endowed  with  mineral  resources  and  land
(climate) tend to be less egalitarian than oth-
ers, although  the  effect  of the  agricultural
comparative advantage may be offset by the
distribution of land.” They also ﬁnd that the
labor  productivity  difference  between  agri-
culture and the rest of the economy is a pow-
erful  explanatory  factor  for  differences  in
income inequality in a number of developing
countries in the 1970s and 1980s.12

A  large  body  of

literature  has  also
explored  the  relationship  between  trade
openness and inequality but has not reached
a consensus. For example, Dollar and Kraay
(2002) and Dollar and Kraay (2004) ﬁnd no
effect  of trade  openness  on  inequality, but
Lundberg  and  Squire  (2003)  do  ﬁnd  such
an  effect. Ravallion  (2001)  and  Milanovic
(2002) report that at low incomes openness
may  be  inequality-increasing, but  that  this
effect reverses at higher incomes.

Trends
The  discussion  above  highlights  the  many
mechanisms  for  hypothesizing  how  aggre-
gate economic growth, and the evolution of
different sectors of the economy, can inﬂu-
ence  economic  inequality. Popular  lines  of
argument  have  emphasized  Lewis-Kuznets

type processes, the race between relative sup-
ply and demand for skills along with house-
hold  adjustments  to  participation, educa-
tion, and  fertility;
the  transitions  from
controlled  to  market-oriented  economic
systems; and  various  forms  of power  and
bargaining-related  views  of the  world. In
the end, and perhaps not surprisingly, it is
difﬁcult  to  identify  a  single  overarching
explanation. Until  recently, this  did  not
seem  to  matter  much  because  there  was  a
general perception that inequality does not
vary markedly over short periods.13 In ear-
lier  studies, few  countries  having  data  on
inequality over multiple time periods indi-
cated sharp changes.

For countries and regions. Empirical investi-
gation of how inequality evolves in a country
is  subject  to  concerns  similar  to  those  for
comparisons of levels (see box 2.5). But there
is a growing sense that the impression of sta-
ble, unchanging income inequality may well
be  misleading. A  few  recent  examples  of
changing  inequality  bear  mentioning. First,
careful  work  by Atkinson  (2003)  has  docu-
mented the evolution of inequality in OECD
countries during the second half the twenti-
eth  century. He  ﬁnds  that  inequality  in  the
United  States  has  been  rising  steadily  since
the early 1970s (after seeing little change, and
possibly  some  decline,
in  the  preceding
decades)  and  has  risen  dramatically  in  the
United  Kingdom  since  1980. Between  1984
and 1990, the Gini coefﬁcient in the United
Kingdom rose by 10 percentage points (but
then did not increase further)—an unprece-
dented increase over such a short time. Else-
where in the OECD, inequality changes have
been less marked. But to the extent that the
early  and  middle  decades  of the  twentieth
century  were  associated  with  declining
inequality  in  these  countries,
this  trend
seems  to  have  halted  by  the  century’s  later
decades.

Second,

inequality 

in  China  was
markedly  higher  at  the  end  of the  1990s
than  it  had  been  in  the  early  part  of the
1980s. In  general, the  recent  evidence  in
East Asia suggests that inequality has risen
faster  in  the  second  round  of high  growth
Asian economies—such as China and Viet-
nam—than  had  been  observed  in  the  ﬁrst

Inequity within countries: individuals and groups

45

round—Hong  Kong  (China), Republic  of
Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, and  Taiwan
(China). A  complete  picture  of the  factors
behind  this  process  is  as  yet  unclear.
Although it is likely that at least part of the
story  is  linked  to  intersectoral  transfers, as
emphasized  by  Lewis  (box  2.6), Ravallion
and Chen (2004) indicate that inequality in
China  grew  fastest  during  periods  when
economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction
were slow. They argue that China provides
little  support  for  the  view  that  rising
inequality is inevitable with rapid economic
growth and poverty reduction.

Third, South  Asia  has  generally  been
perceived  as  a  region  with  relatively  low
inequality. This probably is due, in part, to
inequality  being  measured  by  consump-
tion. In this region, too, the prevailing view
has been that inequality changes little over
time. But the stylized fact of low and stable
inequality in South Asia has also been chal-
lenged. In India, the largest country in the
region, some uncertainty remains over how
inequality  has  evolved, because  of well-
publicized  issues  concerning  data  compa-
rability over time.14 The best available esti-
mates  suggest  that  inequality  in  India  has
been rising, but with no solid assessment of
by how much.15

In  Bangladesh, Nepal, and  Sri  Lanka,
however, recent and reliable data show very
large  increases  of
inequality  in  the  late
1980s  and  1990s. In  Bangladesh, income
inequality  (as  opposed  to  consumption
inequality)  has  been  documented  to  have
risen  from  a  Gini  of 0.30  to  0.41  between
1991 and 2000.16 In Sri Lanka, the increase
in  consumption  inequality  has  been  very
similar, from 0.32 to 0.40 between 1990 and
2002.17 And, in  Nepal, the  Planning  Com-
mission has produced estimates suggesting
that consumption inequality rose from 0.34
to 0.39 between 1995–6 and 2003–4.18 Only
in  Pakistan  is  the  evolution  of inequality
not  clear, because  of difﬁculties  with  data
comparability.

In other regions of the world, the recent
picture  on  inequality  trends  is  more  difﬁ-
cult  to  summarize. For  Latin  America, De
Ferranti  and  others  (2004)  indicate  that
inequality increased in most countries, by a
sizable margin, during the “lost decade” of

46

WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2006

the 1980s. But during the 1990s, inequality
continued to rise in only about half of the
countries in the region, and less rapidly. The
authors  note  that, in  Argentina, inequality
has risen sharply in the growth period and
during  the  crisis  years. In  Brazil  and  Mex-
ico,
the  1990s  witnessed  some  small
declines. In  Eastern  Europe  and  Central
Asia, changes in inequality during the early
1990s, associated with the transition to the
market economy, have been difﬁcult to doc-
ument systematically because of data prob-
lems, according  to  World  Bank  (2000c).
Between  1998  and  2003, consumption
inequality  declined  in  the  former  Soviet
Union  countries  (with  the  exception  of
Georgia and Tajikistan), while there was no
clear  trend  in  eastern  and  southern  Euro-
pean  countries  (World  Bank, 2005a). In
Africa and the Middle East, it is difﬁcult to
point  to  broad  trends, largely  because  of
concerns  with  data  comparability  over
time.

To what extent does our examination of
levels and trends in income inequality bear
on the themes of this report? This report is
most concerned about changes in inequali-
ties  in  incomes, and  other  speciﬁc  dimen-
sions, if these  dimensions  are  associated
with  changes  in  underlying  inequalities  of
opportunities. Rising  income  inequality  in
Russia during the 1990s, for example, is of
concern precisely because of its strong asso-
ciation  with  rising  political  inﬂuence  and
state capture.

interactions 

But  this  is  not  inevitably  the  case. A
recent study of income distribution dynam-
ics  in  six  East  Asian  and  Latin  American
countries  by  Bourguignon, Ferreira, and
Lustig  (2005)  decomposes  income  distri-
bution dynamics into the underlying driv-
ing  forces. They  show  that  complex  and
country-speciﬁc 
between
powerful  underlying  social  and  economic
phenomena imply that distributional expe-
riences must be assessed country by country.
For  example, improvements  in  education
(equalizing  opportunities)  may  be  associ-
ated in one case with falling income inequal-
ity—Brazil  or  Taiwan, China—but 
in
another  country  with  rising  inequality—
Indonesia  or  Mexico. Our  assessment  of
the  equity  implications  of changes  in

income  inequality  will  thus  differ  across
countries.

Across generations. Our assessment will also
depend  on  the  degree  to  which  inequalities
are  transmitted  across  generations. The
study  of intergenerational  transmission  of
welfare  is  not  straightforward, because  of
the scarcity of datasets containing informa-
tion on various generations of adults in the
same family. Data from long panels are rare,
and questions about family background of
individuals are not always asked in surveys
(the  Brazil  data  described  in  box  2.1  are  a
rare  exception). Information  about  educa-
tion or occupation for various generations
can  be  captured  relatively  easily  in  recall
questionnaires. But 
information  about
other  dimensions, such  as  the  incomes,
earnings, or  even  health  status  of earlier
generations, is  not  easily  remembered  by
individuals  (not  least  because  they  often
change  during  a  lifetime). The  scarcity  of
intergenerational  data  is  particularly  strik-
ing  in  developing  countries. Even  though
the persistence of inequalities across gener-
ations  is  often  thought  to  be  much  more
acute  in  developing  countries, studies  on
intergenerational  mobility  in  the  develop-
ing world remain few and far between.

Even when the data exist, differences in
methodologies  and  data  often  limit  the
scope  for  comparisons  across  countries.
The most widespread measure of intergen-
erational mobility in the economics litera-
ture is the intergenerational earnings elas-
ticity, or  the  elasticity  of sons’ earnings
with  the  earnings  of their  parents. This
measure generally comes from a log-linear
regression  of sons’ earnings  (although  it
could also be income or years of schooling)
on  fathers’ observed  earnings  (or  its  pre-
dicted value using such other information
as education or occupation). The closer the
elasticity  is  to  zero, the  more  mobile  the
society is supposed to be. This elasticity has
been  widely  used  in  the  U.S.
literature,
where 
longitudinal  data  are  relatively
abundant. And  for  comparability, it  has
also  been  calculated  in  most  other  coun-
tries’ recent studies.19

Until recently, estimates of the intergener-
ational elasticity of earnings were thought to

Inequity within countries: individuals and groups

47

be around 0.4 in the United States, suggest-
ing a reasonably mobile society in incomes.20
More  recently, however, Mazumder  (2005)
uses new data and recent econometric tech-
niques to correct for transitory ﬂuctuations
in earnings—he shows that the previous esti-
mates  of
intergenerational  elasticity  were
biased  downward  by  about  30  percent. He
argues  that  the  true  estimate  is  somewhere
around 0.6 for the United States.

An  intergenerational  elasticity  of 0.6  com-
pared  to  0.4  paints  a  dramatically  different
picture of mobility in American society. For
example, it implies that a family whose earn-
ings  are  half
the  national  average  would
require  ﬁve  generations  instead  of
three
before  it  substantially  closed  the  gap. Obvi-
ously  a  difference  of two  generations, or
about ﬁfty years, is quite substantial and sug-
gests the need to examine policies that foster
greater mobility.21

In  parallel  analyses, estimates  of inter-
generational  mobility  in  Canada, Finland,
or  Sweden, among  others, have  tended  to
report elasticities closer to 0.2 or lower, sug-
gesting that these societies are considerably
more mobile than the United States. A rela-
tively early study of mobility in the United
Kingdom (Atkinson, Maynard, and Trinder
1983)  reports  an  elasticity  of 0.43, while  a
more recent study by Dearden, Machin, and
Reed (1997) estimates an elasticity of 0.57.
These  studies  indicate  that  people  in  the
United  Kingdom  are  about  as  mobile  as
those  in  the  United  States. Because  of the
data  limitations, only  a  few  exceptional
studies  on  intergenerational  earnings  elas-
ticities  for  less-developed  countries  have
been carried out. These provide evidence of
relatively low mobility.22

In  another  literature  review  of cross-
country  differences  in  intergenerational
earnings  mobility, Solon  (2002)  asks
whether  there  is  any  link  between  cross-
sectional  inequality  within  a  generation
and the intergenerational transmission of
inequality. Although there is greater cross-
sectional  inequality  in  the  United  States
and the United Kingdom than in Sweden
or Finland, Canada also has relatively high
inequality. The  evidence  needed  to  pro-
vide  a  clear  answer  to  this  question  is
therefore still fragmentary, and only “con-

tinuing  research  (on  international  evi-
dence  of intergenerational  mobility)  will
improve  our  understanding  of why  the
intergenerational  transmission  of eco-
nomic  status  is  strong  in  some  countries
and weak in others.”23

The intergenerational transmission mech-
anisms of inequalities will differ across coun-
tries  and  within  countries  across  different
population  groups. As  described  above,
Mazumder (2005) points to rather low lev-
els  of
intergenerational  mobility  in  the
United States. He also highlights an impor-
tant racial dimension to this limited mobil-
ity and ﬁnds evidence of substantial immo-
bility  at  the  ends  of the  distribution. He
shows that of the individuals whose fathers
were  in  the  bottom  decile  of the  earnings
distribution, 50  percent  will  be  below  the
thirtieth  percentile  and  80  percent  below
the sixtieth percentile. He ﬁnds the evidence
to  be  consistent  with  the  hypothesis  that
such  immobility  “might  be  due  to  the
inability  of families  to  invest  in  their  chil-
dren’s  human  capital  due  to  the  lack  of
resources.” By  contrast, more  than  50  per-
cent of the individuals whose parents were
in  the  top  decile  will  remain  above  the
eightieth  percentile  and  two-thirds  will  be
above the median.

In another U.S. study, Hertz (2005) con-
ﬁrms the ﬁndings of Mazumder (and oth-
ers)  on  the  size  of the  intergenerational
elasticity. He then shows evidence that it is
largely  driven  by  the  especially  low  rate  of
mobility of black families from the bottom
of the  income  distribution. While  only  17
percent of whites born to the bottom decile
of family income remain there as adults, the
corresponding  ﬁgure  is  42  percent  for
blacks. He  also  ﬁnds  that  “rags-to-riches”
transitions from the bottom quartile to the
top were less than half as likely for black as
for white families. He further provides evi-
dence  that  the  black-white  mobility  gap  is
not “appreciably  altered  by  controlling  for
parents’ years  of schooling.” Last, he  pro-
vides  evidence  that  the  incomes  of black
children are unresponsive to small changes
in  parents’ incomes  at  the  bottom  of the
distribution.

To recap, summary measures suggest that
even  in  such  developed  countries  as  the

48

WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2006

United States and United Kingdom there is
rather  limited  intergenerational  mobility
across generations. Research in these coun-
tries  has  highlighted  important  hetero-
geneities in the patterns of reproduction of
different 
inequalities  across  populations
groups. For most developing countries, rela-
tively little is known about intergenerational
income mobility. But given the acute group-
based inequalities in many developing coun-
tries, there  appears  to  be  little  basis  for
expecting much intergenerational mobility.

Agency and equity:
inequalities of power
The foregoing discussion has raised explic-
itly  the  question  of how  inequalities  are
determined and reproduced. It has pointed
to the potentially important role of group
differences  in  this  process. This  focus  on
process and the factors that account for the
persistence of inequality over time puts the
spotlight on how much inequality is rooted
in  deeper  institutions  in  society—institu-
tions of governance, access to land, control
of labor, market regulation. Chapter 6 deals
with  the  emergence  and  effects  of such
institutions in more detail. Here we turn to
different  kinds  of evidence—and  tradi-
tions  of analysis—to  discuss  the  unequal
capacity  of people  to  influence  the  form
taken by these institutions and the conse-
quences of unequal institutions for contin-
uing  inequality  in  such  capacities. For

poverty the inequalities in capacity to forge
the institution or society can be as impor-
tant  as  inequalities  in  health, income, and
education.24

A  recent  study  of inequalities  in  gover-
nance  in  four  slums  of Delhi  found  that
access  to  formal  government  by  slum
dwellers  is  more  available  to  the  better  off
and  to  those  who  have  good  contact  net-
works.25 Community leaders in these slums
facilitate  access  primarily  to  their  caste
members, and slum dwellers are more likely
to  delegate  custodianship  of their  interests
to better-educated community leaders. The
study  concludes  that  because  access  to
bureaucracy and political representation for
slum  dwellers  in  Delhi  is  largely  the  pre-
serve of the better off and better connected,
decisions  of formal  policymakers  do  not
seek to represent slum interests as a whole,
producing interventions that do not target
those in most need. The lack of broadly dis-
tributed “voice” thus  results  in  patterns  of
resource allocation, and income generation,
that are far from egalitarian.

The nature of this unequal capacity can
be  captured  through  the  sociological  con-
cept  of agency. Agency  refers  to  people’s
capacity  to  transform  or  reproduce  such
societal institutions. Some of this capacity is
conscious—for  example, when 
interest
groups  lobby  for  a  change  in  land  tenure
legislation, or when women refuse to accept
laws  around  marriage  that  systematically
disadvantage  them. Some  of it  is  uncon-

Inequitable agencies and institutions in Pakistan

A recently completed Human Development
Report for Pakistan provides rich documenta-
tion of the skewed distributional impact of cor-
ruption (United Nations Development
Programme 2003).The report notes that corrup-
tion raises the costs of getting things done—for
setting up a new business, for crossing borders,
for obtaining a driver’s license. In Pakistan these
costs fall most heavily on those least able to
afford them: the poor. According to the Pakistan
Human Development Report, 16.7 percent of
the extremely poor reported paying a bribe to
run their business enterprise, handing over an
average of 6,800 rupees. Only 6.7 percent of the
non-poor paid a bribe, of 9,300 rupees. In rural
areas, the contrast is even starker: 20 percent of

the extremely poor paid a bribe, while only 4.3
percent of the non-poor had to do so. In urban
areas, the extremely poor paid on average 8,700
rupees in bribes, while the non-poor paid only
1,200 rupees.

Similar patterns emerge for mediating dis-

putes.The extremely poor not only pay a higher
price to seek a resolution than the non-poor, but
also they are less likely to receive a satisfactory
outcome (38.5 percent versus 80.8 percent).
Indeed, the fee the extremely poor must pay is
often higher than their annual household
income, leaving many to choose to suffer the
consequences of a dispute even when they are
clearly in the right. In addition, the extremely
poor receive less assistance from the police (the

most immediate representatives of the formal
justice system), who are involved in only 1 per-
cent of their disputes but nearly 5 percent of the
disputes of the non-poor.The poor perceive that
the police will be slow and inefﬁcient in
handling their cases, and they frequently experi-
ence outright harassment and intimidation.
Even to register a case of kidnapping with the
police requires paying a bribe. In these
situations, it is hardly surprising that the poor
ﬁnd it more expedient to take the law into their
own hands, creating in many urban areas a host
of new problems related to gang violence and
vigilantism.

B O X   2 . 8 Legacies of discrimination and the reproduction of inequalities and poverty among the

Batwa in Uganda

The Batwa, who are described in many parts as
pygmy peoples, live in Eastern Uganda, eastern
Democratic Republic of Congo, and Rwanda.
Batwa have been subject to negative stereotypes
since at least 1751, when Edward Tyson
concluded that pygmies were not human but
rather apes or monkeys.They suffer multiple
asset depletion and wide ranging forms of dis-
crimination, a situation that public actions have
at times made worse.Though longstanding forest
dwellers, the British sought to expel them to cre-
ate forest reserves in the 1930s. In 1991, the
Uganda National Park authorities increased
efforts to enforce this exclusion from forest areas.
Although the World Bank—which was funding
some of the park authorities’work—required that
the government assess the impact on indigenous
communities and follow deﬁned compensation
procedures, these did not take sufﬁcient account

of power differences among Batwa and other
affected groups, nor consider Batwa preferences.
All communities were viewed as uniform, a prac-
tice that the authorities later recognized “did not
take into account Batwa realities and left them
with nothing”(Zaninka (2003), 170).

Non-Batwa locals have resisted efforts to pro-

vide more appropriate compensation to the
Batwa.A Participatory Poverty Assessment (PPA)
highlighted persistent discrimination, describing
the Batwa as a “group of people who are
despised”and who “have no means of production
such as land, credit and training.They are
regarded by other ethnic groups in Kisoro as a
people with no rights.”This leads to everyday and
institutionalized forms of exclusion, with the
Batwa suffering discrimination in access to both
public spaces and services.While some Batwa
respond to this by organizing themselves, others

respond in ways that—however rational and self-
protecting—often reproduce the extent to which
they are excluded.The same PPA reports some
Batwa children saying that they did not attend
school because it was so unfriendly to them.
When asked what they wanted to do upon com-
pleting school, one child replied that she wished
to be “a cleaner.”Discrimination and prejudice
diminish the capacity to aspire to and imagine a
different future.

Repudiation and discrimination can also

lead the Batwa to self-exclude from the public
sphere.The PPA notes that no Batwa attended
PPA exercises. Non-Batwa locals explained:
“Batwa would never come to such meetings, so
there is no point in mobilizing them.”

scious—for  example, when  people  engage
in  land  transactions  without  questioning
them, they  reproduce  the  institutions  of
land tenure and the markets in land. When
a disadvantaged group accepts its disadvan-
tage  as “taken  for  granted,” the  effect  is  to
allow  the  continuing  existence  of the  rela-
tionships that create such disadvantage.

The 

internalization  of disadvantage
leads  to  pernicious  forms  of agency  that
perpetuate  inequalities. From  inequalities
in agency come inequalities in power, voice,
and  self-conﬁdence—a  major  part  of our
story (box 2.7). Inequalities of agency are as
much products of dominant institutions as
sources of those institutional arrangements.
Maintaining 
these  arrangements  both
reﬂects  and  produces  the  distribution  of
power among people. As for health, educa-
tion, and income, though, this distribution
can change—and it has. Indeed, it has often
changed  in  relation  to  changes  in  these
other distributions.

Internalization of disadvantage 
and inequalities of agency
Recent  work  on  urban  slum  dwellers  in
India26 (and elsewhere)27 suggests that a key
form of powerlessness for the poor involves
living with “negative terms of recognition.”
This concept highlights the conditions and
constraints under which the poor negotiate

the very norms that frame their social lives.
Being so routinely treated with contempt by
government ofﬁcials, employers, and fellow
citizens—and encountering such enormous
obstacles  to  advancement—means  that
excluded  groups  can, over  time, come  to
subscribe  to  norms  about  themselves  and
their situation “whose social effect is to fur-
ther diminish their dignity, exacerbate their
inequality, and  deepen  their  lack  of access
to material goods and services.”28

In these circumstances, the poor are not
only  persistently  and  overtly  discriminated
against. Their  problems  are  further  com-
pounded and consolidated by their apparent
complicity  in  it, their  revealed  “adaptive
preference”29 for  menial  occupations  and
ascription to norms and subservient behav-
iors that only legitimize and perpetuate their
powerlessness. Dire material circumstances,
rational  expectations  about  their  limited
prospects  for  upward  mobility, and  strong
beliefs about the legitimacy and immutabil-
ity  of their  situation  conspire  to  create  a
vicious circle from which it may be very dif-
ﬁcult for the poor to escape (see box 2.8).30
Inequality  traps  may  cause  crime  and
violence. First, people  who  perceive  their
poverty  as  permanent  may  be  driven  by
hostile  impulses  rather  than  rational  pur-
suit  of their  interests. Second, sensitivity
to inequality, especially  by  those  feeling

50

WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2006

trapped at the bottom, may lead to higher-
risk  tactics  like  crime, when  the  expected
payoffs  from  socially  legitimate  activities
are poor. Third, people may be particularly
sensitive to group-based inequalities. If, for
example, racial  heterogeneity  and  income
inequality  are  correlated  and  consolidate
status  distinctions  in  a  society, this  could
spell potential for violence. Finally, as Mer-
ton (1938) elegantly states,

. . . when a system of cultural values empha-
sizes, virtually above all else, certain common
symbols of success for the population at large
while  its  social  structure  rigorously  restricts
or  completely  eliminates  access  to  approved
modes of acquiring these symbols for a con-
siderable part of the same population, . . . anti-
social  behavior  ensues  on  a  considerable
scale. (italics reﬂect original emphasis)

A lack of upward mobility in a society, com-
bined  with  a  high  premium  on  economic
afﬂuence, results in anomie—a breakdown of
standards and values.31

Changing between-group inequalities
of agency and institutional power
Inequality of agency often leads to institu-
tions  that  reproduce  such  inequality. But
these  relationships  are  not  immutable.
There  are  ample  cases  in  which  interven-
tions—by  civil  society, reformist  public
ofﬁcials, external  actors, religious  institu-
tions, and  others—have  given  more  self-
conﬁdence and assertiveness to disadvantaged
groups, worked against the internalization of
disadvantage, and  created  new  channels  for
excluded groups to exercise voice with greater
effect. These  changes  improve  the  terms  of
recognition  for  the  powerless: they  become
recognized  by  more  powerful  groups  who
otherwise would not acknowledge them at all,
leading  to  empowerment  of disadvantaged
groups  in  economic, social, and  political
realms.

Empowerment can occur in many ways.32
Change typically occurs through the interac-
tion  between  the  opportunities  for  action
created by dominant political structures and
the  capacity  of poorer  or  middle  groups  to
engage. The  “political  opportunity  struc-
ture”—that  shapes 
for
action—is  itself a  function  of the  openness 
of political  institution, the  coherence  and

the  possibilities 

positions  of elites, and  the  effectiveness  of
governments to implement approved courses
of action. The capacity of subordinate groups
is  inﬂuenced  by  their  “economic” capital—
their  education  and  economic  resources—
their “capacity to aspire,” and the closely asso-
ciated capacity to organize.33

In  Indonesia, the  Kecamatan  Develop-
ment  Project  (KDP) 
illustrates  change
occurring  through  action  from  above  and
below: it aims to improve the terms of recog-
nition  and  the  political  agency  of marginal
groups, and  to  create  new  institutions  for
greater agency to lead to material changes in
patterns  of public  investment. Consistent
with the ongoing process of democratization
in  Indonesia, the  source  of change  comes
from  public  policy  rather  than  nongovern-
mental action, allowing the project to oper-
ate on a large scale (see also focus 4 for exam-
ples of change occurring at the local level).

A  recent  study34 of the  efﬁcacy  of the
KDP  on  challenging  and  changing  the
terms  of recognition  of participants  sug-
gests that it does provide villagers with a set
of deliberative routines for more equitably
managing  the  conﬂicts  it  inevitably  trig-
gers.35 These  routines  introduce  marginal
actors to more equitable spaces of engage-
ment  with  more  organized  and  inﬂuential
actors. But  building  this  conﬂict  manage-
ment  capacity  among  marginal  groups
depends on more than just forging collabo-
rative  routines. It  also  requires  a  set  of
rules—deﬁned by the KDP—that limit the
unfair  exercise  of power  by  dominant
groups. With  the  KDP  cultivating  collabo-
ration  and  tangible  points  of political
power  for  marginalized  groups, the  results
include  a  well-functioning  school  or  med-
ical  clinic  but  equally  important  a  style  of
group (re)deﬁnition and defense.

Changes  in  the  agency  of indigenous
peoples in Ecuador since the 1960s provide
another  example  in  which  mobilization
from  below  came  to  change  national  and
local structures. These changes are clear at
both local and national levels. In the 1960s
in  the  Andean  province  of Chimborazo,
the  indigenous  Quichua  people  suffered
multiple  deprivations. They  were  subject
to everyday forms of violence and to dom-
ination  and  racism  in  their  interactions

with other ethnic groups and with author-
ities.36 Power was concentrated in the tri-
umvirate  of landowner, priest, and  local
government  authority. Much  indigenous
labor  was  tied  to  large  rural  estates  on
which labor relations were sometimes vio-
lent and returns to labor manifestly unfair.
Life  expectancy  was  short, alcoholism
severe, and  children’s  access  to  education
and health acutely constrained.

At the start of this twenty-first century,
indigenous  people  now  occupy  several
county mayorships and have a majority of
councilors in several counties. The provin-
cial prefect is also Quichua. Similarly at a
national  level, former  leaders  of national
indigenous people’s organizations are now
ministers. And the national Confederation
of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador has
control of the directorate of bilingual edu-
cation, the indigenous development coun-
cil, and the office of indigenous health. It
also  played  a  big  part  in  negotiating  and
administering a World Bank and Interna-
tional  Fund  for  Agricultural  Develop-
ment–supported national Program for the
Development  of
Indigenous  and  Afro-
Ecuadorian  Peoples. By  any  calculation,
power  relationships  have  changed 
in
Ecuador, becoming  more  equitable, with
indigenous  people  participating  more
completely  (and  more  equitably)  in  their
society.

The inequality trap for women
Unequal opportunities in health, education,
economic welfare, and political agency can
be  readily  observed  in  most  developing
countries. The  preceding  sections  have
emphasized  that  these  different  manifesta-
tions  of inequity  are  not  generally  inde-
pendent  from  one  another  and  that  this
interdependence  can  replicate  inequalities
over  time. This  interrelationship  can  be
vividly illustrated by examining the nature
and implications of the inequality that traps
many women in developing countries.

Men and women around the world have
starkly different access to assets and opportu-
nities, reinforced  by  unequal  norms  and
social structures, perpetuating gender differ-
ences over centuries. Gender inequity directly
affects  the  well-being  of women  and  deci-

B O X   2 . 9 Sex ratios and “missing women”

Gender inequity causes many societies to
display some preference for male children.
But the “son preference” is strong enough
to result in substantial excess female child
mortality in parts of East and South Asia—
leading to the phenomenon of what
Amartya Sen calls “missing women.” (Sen,
1990). In China and India the practice of
female infanticide was noted at least a
century ago, and in the Republic of Korea
and India high juvenile sex ratios (the pro-
portion of male to female children below
the age of 4) have been documented since
the ﬁrst modern censuses were taken. By
contrast there seems to be little son pref-
erence in Southeast Asia or in most other
parts of the developing world.

The reasons for this seem to stem from
rigid patrilineal inheritance systems.While
most societies deny women inheritance
rights, in other parts of the world there is
some ﬂexibility in these rules. In peasant
Europe and Japan, for instance, women
could inherit land if their parents had no
sons. Despite egalitarian laws, customary
practices in China, the Republic of Korea,
and northwest India permit a man, if he
does not have sons, to adopt one from
other male kin. In the past, it would also
have been possible to take another wife.
The driving motivation is to use whatever
means possible to continue the male fam-
ily line.Thus, girl children are undervalued.

During pregnancy, sex-selection may

lead to aborting female fetuses, reﬂected in
sex ratios at birth that are more masculine
than the biological rate of 105 boys for
every 100 girls. Sex-selection can also hap-
pen through infanticide, although the data
make it difﬁcult to distinguish between
selective abortion and infanticide.The third,
and most common, mechanism is the neg-
lect and other practices that result in higher
mortality rates for girls than boys during
early childhood.37

In China, intense efforts by the govern-
ment resulted in a brief improvement in the
sex ratio during 1953–64 (see ﬁgure to the
right). But since the 1980s it has steadily

risen. In the Republic of Korea stark declines
have become only apparent in the last
decade—perhaps because of
improvements in labor market opportuni-
ties for women. India, as a whole, does not
have juvenile sex ratios that are far different
from many other parts of the world. But
northwest India has seen some particularly
worrying trends, with sex ratios sharply ris-
ing between 1981 and 2001, much attribut-
able to the higher incidence of sex-
selection in abortion. Other parts of India,
especially the south, have more equitable
labor markets and fewer restrictions on
women’s mobility and inheritance.

sions  in  the  home, affecting  investments  in
children and household welfare (box 2.9).

Gender 

is 

inequity 

the  archetypical
“inequality trap.” Most societies have norms
that preserve the prevalent social order, delin-
eating different roles and spheres of inﬂuence
for men and women. The male sphere is typi-
cally  outside  the  home  in  market  work  and
social interactions that enhance the family’s

52

WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2006

status and power. The female sphere is usually
inside  the  home—looking  after  household
work, rearing  children, and  contributing  to
the  stability  of the  household. So, women’s
activities  serve  primarily  as  inputs  into  the
household’s collective well-being, while men
are ostensibly at its center—its breadwinners
and  its  link  to  the  larger  world  where  eco-
nomic and social status are determined.

Marriage  and  kinship  systems  preserve
these structures of patriarchy. Most societies
are  “patrilocal,” with  women  moving  from
their  parents  to  their  husband’s  home  after
marriage. Marriage can therefore be thought
of as  a  framework  that  serves  to  exchange
women  between  households, and  marriage
decisions are made with a view toward ensur-
ing that this exchange of women promises the
maximum  gain  to  both  households. The
man’s household is the point of reference—
while the woman is simply an input into the
processes for households controlled by men
to generate economic and social returns.38

Inheritance  tends  to  be  consistent  with
this  pattern. Most  societies  are  not  just
patrilocal—they  are  also  patrilineal, with
inheritance  and  property  rights  primarily
passed on to men. The majority of countries,
outside of Europe and Central Asia and Latin
America and Caribbean, restrict inheritance
rights to women.39 Some countries have leg-
islation  that  guarantees  equality  in  inheri-
tance  laws. But  these  laws  often  are  not
enforced, and  real  authority  over  decisions
on  inheritance  rests  in  the  hands  of village
elders  and  chiefs, who  follow  customary
practices that discriminate against women.

Most countries that have unequal inheri-
tance laws also have unequal property rights
regimes.40 Indeed, the vast majority of land
owners are men.41 Many societies compound
this by denying women the right to divorce.
This  inequality  in  property  rights  regimes
persists even in countries where agricultural
production  depends  heavily  on  women’s
labor, such  as  many  in  Sub-Saharan Africa.
In  Cameroon, women  make  up  more  than
51  percent  of the  population  and  do  more
than 75 percent of the agricultural work, but
they are estimated to hold fewer than 10 per-
cent  of all  land  certiﬁcates.42 So, if women
work on farms, they are usually working on
farms owned by men.

In  addition  to  being  denied  inheritance
and  property  rights, women  in  many  soci-
eties face restrictions on their mobility. For
example, in  the  state  of Uttar  Pradesh  in
northern  India  close  to  80  percent  of
women  require  their  husband’s  permission
to visit a health center, and 60 percent have
to  seek  permission  before  stepping  outside
their  house.43 These  mobility  restrictions
may  be  socially  imposed, as  with  gunghat
among  Hindus—or  have  religious  sanc-
tions, as with purdah among Muslims. Such
practices are not just socially enforced, they
can  be  internalized  by  women  who  treat
them as marks of honorable behavior. These
norms  are  transmitted  by  parents  to  their
children, ensuring their continuity over gen-
erations; in many societies, they are enforced
by older women in the community.44

Restrictions on mobility and rules of kin-
ship  and  inheritance  help  shape  social  per-
ceptions about women’s roles. If women are
socially  and  economically  directed  to  focus
their attention and energy on activities in the
home, this  is  not  just  what  men  expect  of
them—it is also what other women expect of
them. In  much  of the  developing  world,
women’s participation in the labor market is
more  a  function  of adversity  than  active
choice—because  husbands  cannot  earn  an
adequate  income  or  because  of an  unantici-
pated  shock,
illness.
Bangladeshi  women  described  it  this  way,
“Men work to support their families, women
work because of need.”45 Women around the
world participate in a fair amount of market-
based activity for a wage, but they have to con-
tinue to perform most household chores (ﬁg-
ure  2.13). They  thus  face  a  time  squeeze,
spending more time at work, both in and out
of the home, than men do.

such  as  a  child’s 

Because  social  and  economic  factors
determine women’s life chances more in mar-
riage than in labor markets, parents invest less
in  their  human  capital. Throughout  the
developing  world, women  are  much  less
likely  to  be  enrolled  in  secondary  school  or
university than men.46 So, they typically work
in less lucrative occupations. Moreover, labor
markets  may  themselves  be  discriminatory,
paying  women  less  than  men  for  the  same
work. For  these  reasons, even  when  women
participate in the labor market, they earn less

than men. Low earnings are a further disin-
centive for women to enter the labor market,
perpetuating traditional social roles.

Inequality in the home
For  a  long  time, economists  did  not  ade-
quately recognize that gender inequity has an
impact  in  the  home, and  models  of the
household assumed that decisions were taken
by  one  person—with  no  room  for  different
choices  across  spouses. The  consequence  of
this world view is not just academic. It sug-
gests, for  instance, that  policy  interventions
that  attempt  to  alleviate  poverty  should  not
bother with targeting by gender—or suggests
that taxes on a household will not affect the
allocation of resources within it.

Economists  now  question  this  view,
developing  models  of household  decision
making  that  allow  for  inequality  between
spouses. The  new  models  start  with  the
assumption that households are efﬁcient, in
the sense that they make decisions that max-
imize  the  use  of the  household’s  resources.
With this assumption, the models show that
a  spouse’s  share  in  household  resources  is
determined  by  two  factors. The  ﬁrst  is  the
fallback option for the spouse in the event of
divorce—laws of inheritance, property, and
divorce would matter here. Second is the rel-
ative size of the spouse’s contribution to the
household’s income, which is determined by
their opportunities in the labor market.47 If
husbands  and  wives  have  different  prefer-
ences, an  increase  in  a  woman’s  outside
options  or  in  her  labor  market  opportuni-
ties  should  reﬂect  consumption  choices
more in line with her preferences.

Econometric  work  conﬁrms  that  an  in-
crease  in  a  woman’s  relative  worth  and  an
improvement  in  her  fallback  options  have
effects  on  consumption  patterns.48 The
health  of Brazilian  children  improves  when
additional nonlabor income is in the hands of
women.49 In the United Kingdom, when leg-
islation ensured that child support payments
were made directly to mothers, expenditures
on  children’s  clothing  tended  to  rise.50 In
Bangladesh and South Africa, women bring-
ing  more  assets  into  the  marriage  increase
household expenditures on children’s educa-
tion.51 The  patterns  seem  to  indicate  that,
when women are better off, children seem to

beneﬁt more than when men are better off.
The most obvious way to explain bargaining
and sharing is to assume that women intrin-
sically care more about children than men do,
but this risks being tautological.

Perhaps the explanation can beneﬁt from
understanding that social and economic dif-
ferences  outside  the  household  can  matter
not  only  for  determining  bargaining  power
but also for socially determined perceptions
of what  men  and  women  consider  impor-
tant. If men  and  women  occupy  different
“outside” and “inside” spheres of inﬂuence, it
seems  to  make  sense  that  improvements  in
women’s  incomes  would  have  a  greater
impact  on  investments  in  the  household.
Improvements  in  the  income  of men, by
contrast, are more likely to result in socializ-
ing  activities  outside  the  home  and  in  pur-
chases that reﬂect social status.

Another  consequence  of this  separation
between  inside  and  outside  roles  is  that

inequalities in the home are also manifested
in  differences  in  access  to  information,
which  can  be  used  to  manipulate  intra-
household  bargaining. In  an  ethnographic
study  of Bangladeshi  garment  workers,
Kabeer (1997) found that men and women

them. Women  may  also  hesitate  to  share
information with their husbands, or to col-
laborate efﬁciently in farming their plots of
land, to retain control over their property. In
studying the farms owned by men and those
owned  by  women  in  Ghana, Udry  (1996)
found, keeping  other  things  constant, that
women-owned  farms  were  less  productive
than those owned by men. When wives and
husbands  are  not  sharing  information, or
manipulating the ﬂow of information, they
clearly  are  not  using  their  resources  opti-
mally.
intrahousehold
behavior  is  not  efﬁcient—contradicting  an
important assumption in economic models.
The widespread domestic violence in the
family is another type of inefﬁciency. Recent
World  Health  Organization  (WHO)  data
show that both physical and sexual violence
are widespread in diverse parts of the world
(table 2.2). An important reason for domes-

In  other  words,

tic  violence  is  that  it  allows  husbands  to
institute a regime of terror to control their
wives’ behavior. In  India, Bloch  and  Rao
(2002) ﬁnd that husbands systematically use
violence  as  a  means  of extracting  a  larger
dowry from their wives. This “instrumental”
use  of violence  has  widespread  acceptance
among both men and women. Surveys have
found that large percentages of respondents
in  developing  countries  report  that  men
have the right to beat their wives when they
answer back or disobey them.52

Gender  inequity  is  thus  the  result  of an
overlapping set of economic, social, cultural,
and  political  inequalities  that  reinforce  each
other. They cause women to have less access to
property rights, wealth, and education—and
limit  their  access  to  labor  markets  and  to
spheres of activity outside the home. This, in
turn, constrains  their  ability  to  inﬂuence
household decisions. Also limiting this inﬂu-
ence  are  asymmetries  of information  in  the
household and the use of violence to control
women’s behavior. All of this maintains a clear
demarcation between the roles of women and
men, readily reproduced across generations.

There  are  some  signs  that  changes  in
labor markets and interventions by the state
can break this inequality trap. The develop-
ment of the garment industry in Bangladesh
has resulted in a sharp and visible increase in
women’s  access  to  a  lucrative  labor  market,
expanding  their  ability  to  inﬂuence  house-
hold  choices.53 Higher  wages  for  women
seem to compensate for restrictive practices,
such  as  purdah, by  reducing  limits  on
women’s  physical  mobility, and  increasing
their  say  in  household  decision  making.54
Globalization  has  expanded  opportunities
for  women  in  Mumbai  and  increased  their
access to schooling.55 A comparative study of
the Philippines, Sumatra, and Ghana found
that patterns of land inheritance and invest-
ments in schooling have became more egali-
tarian  because  of changes  in  labor  market
opportunities  for  women.56 And  although
China, Republic of Korea, and India started
out with similar discriminatory social struc-
tures, intervention by the state has improved
gender equity much more in China than in
Republic of Korea or India.57

Equity from a global
perspective

In  examining  the  inequality  of opportuni-
ties  within  countries, the  previous  chapter
emphasized  people’s  “predetermined  cir-
cumstances,” or  life  chances  beyond  their
control, as distinct from their “efforts” and
“talents” as  individuals. One  of these  cir-
cumstances  is  a  person’s  place  of birth. In
many  countries, access  to  basic  public
health services, for example, is signiﬁcantly
lower  in  rural  areas  than  in  urban  areas.
That can mean much for surviving the ﬁrst
year of life—the infant mortality rate in Rio
de Janeiro was 3.3 percent in 1996, less than
half the 7.4 percent in northeast Brazil.

But, just  as  being  born  in  a  village  or  a
city  is  one  circumstance  that  should  be
irrelevant to a person’s chances in life, being
born in a speciﬁc country is another. Why is
it objectionable for, say, Turkish women to
have  inferior  opportunities  and  outcomes
compared  with  Turkish  men, but  not  so
objectionable if the comparison is between
Turkish men and English women? After all,
in  many  dimensions  of well-being, major
differences  in  opportunities  and  outcomes
exist between citizens of different countries,
in some cases differences larger than those
between various groups within countries.

This chapter tries to answer two questions.
First, how much does one’s country of birth
determine one’s opportunities in life? Second,
does one’s country of birth mean less for life
chances  today  than  in  the  near  or  distant
past?  To  answer  these  questions, we  discuss
inequalities in health, education, income, and
power in the global arena. We show that the
inequalities between countries are staggering
despite some improvements over time.

Examples and concepts
There  is  no  doubt  that  we  live  in  a  world
with massive inequalities in the opportuni-

ties to live a free, healthy, and fulﬁlled life.
As Angus Deaton writes,

We  are  living  with  appalling  inequalities, in
which the poor of the world die of AIDS, and,
more broadly, where poor people around the
world die of diseases that are readily prevent-
able elsewhere, including  in  the  ﬁrst-world
hospitals  and  clinics  that  serve  the  rich  in
poor countries.1

In 2000 the life expectancy of a child born
in Sierra Leone (37 years) or Botswana (39
years)  was  less  than  half that  for  a  child
born in the United States (77 years).2 The
average educational attainment (uncondi-
tional on quality of schooling) of an indi-
vidual  born  in  a  Sub-Saharan  country
between 1975 and 1979 is less than 6 years,
but  more  than  12  years  in  OECD  coun-
tries. Inequalities  in  income  are  also  high
among individuals in different parts of the
world.3

How do we view large average improve-
ments in the world, set against this picture
of unacceptable inequalities between coun-
tries? Sen (2001) describes the current state
of the  world  while  making  the  case  for  a
fairer distribution of the fruits of globaliza-
tion: “Even though the world is incompara-
bly  richer  than  ever  before, ours  is  also  a
world  of extraordinary  deprivation  and
staggering 
inequality.” He  argues  that
whether there have been some gains for all
is not as important as whether the distribu-
tion  of gains  has  been  fair. Inequalities  in
afﬂuence—and in political, social, and eco-
nomic  power  among  countries—are  cen-
tral to the debate on globalization. As long
as the sharing of potential gains from glob-
alization  is  viewed  as  unfair  by  many, the
inequalities  described  in  this  chapter  will
be deemed unacceptable. This, despite the

55

fact  that  absolute  poverty  has  declined  in
the last two decades—though by no means
uniformly.

To put global inequalities in well-being in
perspective, it  helps  to  examine  two  coun-
tries  at  opposite  ends  of the  spectrum—
Mali, one of the world’s poorest countries,
and the United States, one of the richest. A
baby born in Mali in 2001 had an approxi-
mately  13  percent  chance  of dying  before
reaching age one, with this chance declining
only slightly (to 9 percent) even if the baby
were born to a family in the top quintile of
the  asset  distribution. By  contrast, a  baby
born in the United States the same year had
a less than 1 percent chance of dying in its
ﬁrst year. The picture for under-ﬁve mortal-
ity  is  even  more  egregious: 24  percent  of
children  will  not  reach  age  ﬁve  in  Mali,
compared with less than 1 percent of Amer-
ican  children. Even  a  child  born  into  the
richest  quintile  in  Mali  is  more  than  16
times  likely  to  die  before  age  ﬁve  than  an
average American child.

The picture does not improve for educa-
tion. The  average  American  born  between
1975 and 1979 has completed more than 14
years  of schooling  (roughly  the  same  for
men  and  women, and  in  urban  and  rural
areas), while the average school attainment
for the same cohort in Mali is less than two
years, with  women’s  attainment  less  than
half that for men, and virtually zero in rural
areas. If one  considers  the  quality  of the
education received, the inequalities in learn-
ing achievement are possibly much larger.

It is not surprising, then, that many citi-
zens  of Mali, having  survived  immense
hardships  as  children  and  without  much
education, can  barely  eke  out  a  living  as
adults, on  average  living  on  less  than  $2  a
day ($54 a month) in 1994. By comparison,
the  average  American  earned  $1,185  a
month, more  than  20  times  that  for  the
average Malian.

inequalities 

While there is probably some consensus
that 
education,
income, and voice are large globally, there is
much  less  agreement  on  whether  things
have  been  getting  better  or  worse. Is  one’s
country  of origin  more  or  less  pertinent
today  to  the  life  chances  that  she  faces  at
birth  than  it  was  20, 50, or  200  years  ago?

inequalities 

The  debate  on 
in  various
dimensions of well-being and their relation
to  globalization  rages  on  as  you  read  this
report.4 It is indeed harder to assert whether
inequalities  increased  or  decreased  over
time. Various questions have to be answered
ﬁrst: inequality  of what, over  which  time
period, using  which  concept  of inequality?
While there is some evidence of convergence
in  opportunities  in  health  and  education
and some divergence in incomes (or at least
lack of convergence), these results cannot be
stated  without  many  qualiﬁcations  and
caveats. Box 3.1 introduces some underlying
concepts that need to be clariﬁed.

Global inequalities in health
The unweighted and weighted international
distributions  of
life  expectancy  at  birth
(ignoring the distribution of life expectancy
at birth within countries) both show a clear
“twin-peakedness” in 1960.7 Data show that
50 countries had life expectancies between
35  and  45  years, 41  countries  had  life
expectancies between 65 and 75 years, and
there was relatively little mass in the middle
of the distribution.

By 1980 the left-hand mode of the distri-
bution had decreased considerably in size.
The  distributions  began  to  look  more
right-skewed, unimodal, especially  in  the
weighted 
international  distribution: 73
countries  had  a  life  expectancy  between  65
and 75, compared with 31 countries between
55 and 65, and 35 countries between 45 and
55. But by 2000 the two modes become evi-
dent once again, especially in the unweighted
distribution, although there is more mass in
the right mode of the distribution.

In  1980, the  average  life  expectancy  in
four regions—Middle East and North Africa,
East  Asia  (excluding  China  and  Japan),
South  Asia, and  Sub-Saharan  Africa—was
below the world average.8 Between 1980 and
2000, rapid increases in life expectancy in the
ﬁrst  three  of these  regions  were  globally
inequality-reducing, while the decline of life
expectancy  in  Sub-Saharan  Africa  in  the
1990s  boosted  inequality  by  stretching  the
bottom  tail  of the  distribution. By  2000,
only  South  Asia  and  Sub-Saharan  Africa
were below the world average, with the dif-
ference in life expectancy  at  birth  between

the division of the gains from globalization.
The measures most widely quoted by the crit-
ics of globalization treat each country as one
observation, while decompositions of world
inequality into between-country and within-
country components described above give
people equal weight, whether they live in
China or Chad.

Note that in the globalization debate, the
choice of the measure of inequality can also
depend on the question one is trying to
answer. If one is interested in the impact of
some “globalizing” policies on growth or distrib-
utional outcomes at the country level, it might
be preferable to use a measure of intercountry
inequality.

Why use international inequality—
as we do in this report?
Alternatively, if we are trying to determine
whether world poverty or inequality decreased
as a result of “globalizing” policies, then we
might be more inclined to examine measures of
international inequality.

No right or wrong choice
Arguments can be made in favor of each of
these two concepts when assessing trends in
inequality between countries.This choice is not
a matter of what is right or wrong. When it
comes to judging inequality, intelligent people
can disagree about whether countries or peo-
ple should be weighted equally—something
that Ravallion (2004a) argues in detail.The
point: the judgments (or the questions of inter-
est) that affect the choice of the inequality con-
cept employed in empirical work matter greatly
to the assessment one can make about the dis-
tributive justice of current globalization
processes.

On the welfare gains from globalization, the
two sides of the debate often make
statements that are diametrically opposed, all
the while examining the same data. While
there are some differences in and problems
with data, the wide discrepancy in views on
the topic seems to stem from the fact that the
two sides do not share the same values about
what constitutes a just distribution of the
gains from globalization.

Considered here are three different

concepts of inequality, drawing from Milanovic
(2005) and Ravallion (2004a). Both authors, and
the globalization debate in general, discuss
these “competing concepts” in the domain of
incomes. But these concepts can be extended to
other dimensions, such as health and education
(especially for inequality between countries).
The conclusions one would draw in each of
these dimensions of well-being then depend on
the concept of inequality adopted. It is impossi-
ble for the two sides to communicate without
ﬁrst making these concepts clear.

Has global income inequality increased or

not? Before we can answer this, we have to
deﬁne what we mean by global inequality and
how that differs from what we will call interna-
tional and intercountry inequality.

Global inequality: forget country
boundaries, each person has his 
or her real income
Global inequality is easy to deﬁne: simply forget
countries, line up all citizens of the world, and
calculate the inequality in the distribution of
their real incomes, adjusted for purchasing
power parity.5 The global inequality measures
that belong to the general entropy class, such as
a mean log deviation or Theil’s index, can be
neatly decomposed into inequality attributable
to inequalities between persons within each
country and the mean differences of income
between countries (Shorrocks 1980).

Within-country inequality is what the overall

inequality in the world would be if there were
no differences in mean consumption across
countries but each country had its actual
inequality level. Between-country inequality can
be interpreted as measuring what the level of
inequality in the world would be if everyone
within each country had the same (the country-
average) consumption level.Total inequality in
the world is the sum of these two parts, and the
ratios of the respective parts to total inequality
provide a measure of the percentage contribu-
tion of between-country and within-country
inequality to total inequality.

International inequality: each person has
his or her country’s mean income
Throughout the rest of the report, we will refer
to this between-country inequality as interna-

tional inequality, the inequality in the distribu-
tion of all of the world’s citizens, but with each
person assigned the mean income of his/her
country instead of his/her own income. Global
inequality is calculated by simply adding inter-
national inequality to within-country inequality.

Intercountry inequality: each country has
one representative at its mean income
These two concepts, however, are not enough to
settle the debate.Think of the following state-
ment in support of the argument that inequality
in the world has been increasing:“The GDP per
capita of the richest country in the world was
about 9 times that of the poorest around 1870
compared with 45 times by 1990.”6 Notice that
while this statement seems to be referring to
something akin to international inequality, there
is a subtle but very important difference: the
size of the richest or the poorest country plays
no role in this statement.The statement remains
the same whether the richest country is Palau
and the poorest country is Jamaica, or whether
they are China and India.

This is why a third concept is needed. In this
concept, all countries of the world (instead of all
citizens) line up together, and each of them is
assigned her mean income.We will call the
inequality in this distribution (of roughly 200 or
so countries of the world) intercountry inequal-
ity. Milanovic (2005) refers to our intercountry,
international, and global inequality concepts as
Concept 1, Concept 2, and Concept 3 inequality,
respectively (see ﬁgure below).

Why use intercountry inequality
The implicit value judgment in using inter-
country inequality instead of international
inequality is that countries, not people, should
get equal weight in assessing the fairness of

years  to  15.6. Between-country  inequality

consistent improvements in life expectancy
at  birth  came  to  a  screeching  halt  in  the
1990s (table 3.1). Between-country inequal-
ity among developing countries is as high as
it has ever been since 1960.

So, there  is  some  convergence  in  life
expectancy  at  birth  over  a  long  period,
although  there  are  signiﬁcant  losses  in  the
1990s in Sub-Saharan Africa, mainly caused
by AIDS, and in some European and Central
Asian countries.9 With the developed coun-
tries reaching a biological limit at the top of
the distribution and many regions catching
up to them, the inequality of life expectancy
in the world will become more a function of
changes in health and population growth in
Sub-Saharan Africa—barring a major health
catastrophe  elsewhere  in  the  world. (We
revisit  this  issue  at  the  end  of the  chapter.)
But  for  now  there  remain  two  worlds  with
signiﬁcantly  different  life  expectancies: the
gap in life expectancy between Sub-Saharan
Africa  and  Europe  and  North  America  in
2000 is higher than it was in 1950.10

Health  outcomes  of even  the  rich  citi-
zens  in  poor  countries  remain  well  below

the average in OECD countries. For exam-
ple, for all countries with average per capita
GDP below the $2 a day threshold, the child
mortality  rate  of the  richest  20  percent  of
the  population  is  more  than  10  times  the
OECD  average  of six  years.11 While  this  is
also  certainly  the  case  with  many  other
indicators, it is difﬁcult to make statements
about how large differences between coun-
tries  are  in  comparison  with  inequalities
within  countries. Unlike 
income
inequality  literature, there  are  no  accepted
practices  for  decomposing  inequalities  in
health  into  within-country  and  between-
country components.12

the 

Consider, however, a  simple  thought
experiment. In the 45 developing countries
for  which  a  Demographic  Health  Survey
was  available  in  2000, 4.9  million  infant
deaths could be prevented by bringing their
infant  mortality  levels  to  the  OECD  aver-
age. But if one eliminated the infant mortal-
ity  gap  between  the  rich  and  the  poor
within each of the same countries by lower-
ing the infant mortality rate for everyone to
the level of the top decile, 3.1 million infant
deaths  could  be  prevented.13 While  the
average infant mortality rate for the rich in
these  poor  countries  is  almost  five  times
larger  than  the  OECD  average, it  seems
that eliminating within-country differences
between the rich and the poor (by improv-
ing the health of the poor), at least in this
particular  case, would  get  us  about  two-
thirds of the way to the number of total pre-
ventable deaths (by moving everyone to the
OECD average).

So, while large differences in health out-
comes remain between countries and within
them, it  is  not  possible  to  make  deﬁnitive
statements  about  the  relative  weight  of
these components in global health inequali-
ties. One can say, however, that there is no
clear presumption that inequalities between
countries  dwarf those  within  them. This
ﬁnding, as we will see later in this chapter,
stands in sharp contrast to that in incomes
but is congruent with that in education.

While  technical  change  in  private  and
public  health  knowledge  may  be  more
important to account for the overall better
health,14 income  may  be  important  in  the
poorest  countries, through  its  impact  on

water, health  systems, demand  for  ade-
quately  operated  and  equipped  health  sys-
tems, and basic sanitary knowledge, the lat-
ter two having much to do with education,
particularly women’s education.16

While life expectancy at birth continued
to increase, and the infant and child mortal-
ity  rates  declined, the  last  decade  of the
twentieth  century  has  seen  a  divergence
between rich and poor countries.17 The dif-
ﬁculties  faced  by  Europe  and  Central  Asia
countries during transition, and the spread
of HIV/AIDS and civil conﬂicts, were major
factors  in  this, but  they  are  not  solely
responsible.18 Cornia and Menchini (2005)
cite  changes  in  health  spending, public
health programs, and the structure and sta-
bility of households as possible reasons for
the  slowdown  in  health  progress  in  devel-
oping countries.

Global inequalities in education
The  unweighted  distribution  of adult
school  attainment  was  clearly  left-skewed
in  1960  (ﬁgure  3.3). This  reﬂects  the  fact
that many countries, particularly in Africa
and Asia, had mean years of schooling close
to zero. The weighted distribution, like that
for  life  expectancy  at  birth, was  bimodal,
with  one  peak  around  two  years  of mean
schooling and a smaller peak around eight
years.

Note:Inequality in years of schooling is measured using GE (0.5), that is, the general entropy class inequality measure
with an inequality aversion parameter of 0.5.

Many  of these  countries  saw  large  in-
creases in enrollments in the 1960s, 1970s,
and  1980s. As  these  younger  cohorts  aged,
the mean years of schooling in their coun-
tries  increased, and  the  skewness  in  the
unweighted  international  distribution  of
schooling  disappeared. Note  that  the  bi-
modal distribution of schooling across per-
sons  (weighted  by  population)  persisted
until the 1990s and then gave way to a uni-
modal distribution only by 2000.

By any measure the international distri-
bution of years of schooling has undergone
dramatic  changes  between  1960  and  2000.
As  mean  levels  have  risen, inequality  has
fallen, decade after decade (ﬁgure 3.4). The
mean  years  of educational  attainment  for
the  world  almost  doubled  from  3.4  to  6.3
(table 3.2). Sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle
East  and  North  Africa, and  South  Asia
started  with  high  inequalities  (not  shown
here)  and  reduced  them  over  time—the
Middle  East  and  North  Africa  region  was
particularly  successful. Latin  America  and
the Caribbean and East Asia also had some
inequalities, which  they  essentially  elimi-
nated for their youngest cohorts. Despite the
progress, mean levels of educational attain-

ment in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia
remain low even for the youngest cohorts.

While  signiﬁcant  disparities  remain  in
educational  attainment  across  countries
despite evidence of signiﬁcant catch-up by
poorer  countries  in  the  past  half century,
there is also large variation within countries
(chapter 2). In fact, less than 20 percent of
the  inequality  in  educational  attainment
between  adults  born  between  1935  and
1979  is  attributable  to  that  between  coun-
tries, a share that has been steadily declining
over time. While both inequality within and
between  countries  is  declining, the  rate  of
convergence  in  country  means  has  been
faster.

The story remains the same when decom-
posing  inequality  in  educational  attainment
into  inequalities  between  men  and  women.
Roughly a quarter of global inequality in edu-
cational  attainment  is  attributable  to  differ-
ences between men and women, but this gap
is again declining over time, from 31 percent
in the oldest cohort in our sample, to 16 per-
cent in the youngest. But there are large dif-
ferences in this convergence by region (ﬁgure
3.5). While Latin America and the Caribbean,
East Asia, and Europe and Central Asia seem
to  have  reached  gender  parity  in  education,
along  with  other  developed  countries, the
progress  in  South Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa,
and  the  Middle  East  and  North  Africa  has
been slower. Women still lag far behind men
in educational attainment.

It  should  not  be  assumed  that  high
attainment necessarily implies high achieve-
ment, and vice versa. An analysis of the rela-
tionship  between  attainment  (measured  by
the  percentage  of 25  to  34  year  olds  with
upper-secondary  education)  and  achieve-
ment  (measured  by  reading  proﬁciency  of
15  year  olds)  in  27  OECD  countries  (plus
Brazil) shows a rank correlation coefﬁcient
between  these  two  variables  of 0.57. It  is
clear that the rankings of countries accord-
ing to these two indicators are not the same.
The Republic of Korea and Japan (at the top
of the OECD distribution) and Mexico, Por-
tugal, and Turkey (at the bottom) have simi-
lar  ranks  for  both  attainment  and  achieve-
ment. But the Czech Republic, Norway, and
the  United  States  do  worse  in  achievement
than attainment. And achievement rankings

higher than their rankings in attainment.

Achievement differences between devel-
oping  countries  and  OECD  countries  re-
main strikingly large. Using internationally
comparable assessments of reading, mathe-
matics, and  science, Pritchett  (2004b)
shows that developing countries do not just
constitute the lower tail of the learning dis-
tribution, but that most actually do far worse
than  the  poorest  performing  OECD  coun-
tries. For  example, children  in  Argentina,
Mexico, and  Chile  perform  about  two
(OECD)  standard  deviations  below  chil-
dren  in  Greece—one  of the  poorest  per-
forming countries in the OECD. In reading

the level of a French student at the seventh
percentile. Considering  children  who  have
never  attended  school, those  who  enrolled
but dropped out, and those who completed
grade  nine  but  whose  test  scores  remain
more  than  one  standard  deviation  below
the OECD mean in mathematics, Pritchett
ﬁnds that 96 percent of 15 to 19 year olds in
Morocco  lack  achievement  in  “adequate
learning.”19

Global inequalities 
in income and expenditure
The  answers  to  basic  questions—such  as
whether income inequality has been increas-
ing  or  decreasing—depends, among  other
things, on  which  concept  of inequality  is
under the microscope: intercountry inequal-
ity (in the distribution of unweighted coun-
try  means), international  inequality  (in  the
distribution  of country  means  weighted  by
their  population  size), or  global  inequality
(in the distribution of individual incomes).

We start the discussion by presenting the
median  and  mean  incomes  of selected
countries  by  region  for  a  range  of years

between 1997 and 2002, as well as the dis-
persion of those incomes within each coun-
try  (ﬁgure  3.6). Large  differences  across
countries and across people within coun-
tries  are  striking. For  example, an  indi-
vidual  in  the  tenth  percentile  in  the  U.S.
distribution enjoys a level of income higher
than  an 
individual  earning  the  mean
income  in  Brazil  or  Argentina.20 While  a
Chinese individual living in a rural area has
a mean income similar to an average Cam-
bodian, an  urban  Chinese  enjoys  a  similar
income  to  an  average  Brazilian.21 A  South
African at the bottom of the income distri-
bution in her country earns as much as the
average  individual  in  Mali  while  a  South
African  at  the  ninetieth  percentile  of that
income  distribution  enjoys  a  standard  of
living (in income) comparable to that of a
median Irish individual.

The difference in the evolution of inter-
country  (unweighted)  and  international
(weighted)  inequality  between  1950  and
2000—borrowing  from  Milanovic  (2005),
who calls this the “mother of all inequality
disputes”—could hardly be more dramatic
(ﬁgure 3.7). When countries are the unit of

observation, (intercountry)  inequality  has
been undeniably increasing, especially since
the  1980s. But  international  inequality  has
been  steadily  declining, thanks  mostly  to
the income growth in some populous coun-
tries, mainly  China  and  India. Note  that
intercountry  inequality  and  international
inequality  without  China  and  India  track
each other quite closely from 1980 onward,
coinciding with the period of rapid growth
in  these  two  countries, the  slower  average
growth  in  other  developing  countries, and
the declines in measured output in Eastern
Europe and former Soviet Union countries.
If Luxembourg and Nicaragua, at oppo-
site ends of the world income distribution,
grew  at  the  same  annual  rate  of 2  percent
per capita a year for the next 25 years, the
per  capita  yearly  incomes  in  Luxembourg
would increase from $17,228 (PPP-adjusted)
to  $28,264, an  increase  of more  than
$10,000 dollars. That of Nicaragua, by con-
trast, would increase by a mere $375, from
$573  to  $940, during  the  same  period.
Atkinson  and  Brandolini  (2004)  note  that
“with  annual  per  capita  growth  rates  of 5
percent  in  China  and  2  percent  in  the
United  States, the  absolute  income  gap
between the two countries would widen for
a further 41 years before starting to narrow,
to ﬁnally disappear in 72 years.”

The  evaluative  judgments  drawn  about
the  distributional  changes  associated  with
globalization  may  depend  crucially  on
whether  one  thinks  about  inequality  in

absolute terms or relative terms. There is no
economic theory that tells us that inequality
is relative, not absolute. Again, as with inter-
country  and  international  inequality, it  is
not that one concept is right and the other
one wrong. Nor are they two ways of meas-
uring the same thing. Instead, they are two
different concepts. The revealed preferences
for one concept over another reﬂect implicit
value  judgments  about  what  constitutes  a
fair  division  of
the  gains  from  growth.
Those  judgments  need  to  be  brought  into
the  open  and  critically  scrutinized  before
one  can  take  a  well-considered  position  in
this debate.

An examination of international inequal-
ity  using  absolute  rather  than  relative  meas-
ures  of inequality  reveals  a  steady  increase
over  the  long  run, as  well  as  in  recent
decades—this  latter  ﬁnding  contrasts  with
relative international inequality trends. Atkin-
son and Brandolini (2004) ﬁnd that absolute
indexes  of inequality, such  as  the  Absolute
Gini  and  the  Kolm  Index22 (with  various
parameters of inequality aversion), have been
increasing steadily since 1970 (ﬁgure 3.8).23

WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2006

What  happened  to  global  inequality  in
the past 20 years or so has been the subject
of ﬁerce debate in the context of globaliza-
tion and is perhaps the hardest question to
answer. Some  authors24 claim  that  global
inequality increased slightly, while others25
argue that they have declined.

Examining  global  inequality  requires
knowledge of the distribution of inequal-
ity  within  each  country. Household  sur-
veys that collect such data are a relatively
new  phenomenon, having  become  more
common since the 1980s even in develop-
ing  countries. So,
if we  want  to  know
about  the  distribution  of
income  for
everyone in the world, we are confined to
a  much  shorter  time  period. We  have
selected three waves, similar to those used
by Milanovic (2005): 1986–1990, 1991–96,
and 1997–current.

Global  inequality  (measured  by  the
mean log deviation) did not change signif-
icantly over this period, although there is a
slight  decrease  between  1993  and  2000
(figure  3.9). The  mean  log  deviation  for
the  world  would  have  increased  without
China and India, consistent with the con-
sensus  in  the  literature  that  international
inequality  declined  in  this  period  thanks
largely to these two countries. But if global
inequality  stayed  roughly  the  same  while
international inequality declined, inequal-
ity  within  countries  must  have  increased
by  approximately  the  same  amount—a
subject that we discuss below.

was neutralized by increases within countries

Most  of the  world’s  income  inequality
can be explained by the differences in coun-
try  means—that  is, by  international  (or
between-country) inequality. Our estimates
show  that  the  share  of global  inequality,
which  can  be  attributed  to 
inequality
between  countries, declined  steadily  from
78  percent  around  1988  to  74  percent
around  1993  and  to  67  percent  by  around
2000. With global inequality staying roughly
the  same  during  this  period, within-group
inequality  increased  at  a  somewhat  steady
pace  (ﬁgure  3.9). These  results  are  consis-
tent  with  the  evidence  (in  chapter  2)  of
increasing  inequality  within  countries  in
many  parts  of
including
Bangladesh, China, the  United  Kingdom,
and the United States.

The  between-country  share  of global
inequality is also consistent with Milanovic
(2005), who puts this ﬁgure at about 71 per-
cent 
is  possible  that  the
Milanovic  ﬁgures  overestimate  between-
country  inequality  because  he  assigns  all
households  in  a  decile  the  same  income
instead  of estimating  a  Lorenz  curve  (for
percentiles). Our 
slightly
improved  data  from  Milanovic  in  three
aspects. First, for many countries, we calcu-
late our welfare measures using raw data at
the  household  level, while  Milanovic  (and
many others) use grouped data. Second, we
incorporate  more  recent  data  for  the  cur-
rent period, possibly providing an improve-
ment in data quality, especially for Eastern
European  countries. Third, for  the  coun-
tries with grouped data, we estimate Lorenz
curves instead of assigning everyone in the
group  with  the  same  income.26 That  most
of
the  global  inequality  in  incomes  is
explained  by  between-country  inequality
seems  to  be  a  robust  ﬁnding  in  the  litera-
ture, in  stark  contrast  with  the  picture  in
health and education.

Over a much longer period (1820–1992)
Bourguignon  and  Morrisson  (2002)  esti-
mate  that  global 
inequality  has  been
steadily  increasing, because  of a  rapid
increase  in  international  inequality  until
World War II, and then to smaller increases
in  both  within-country  and  international
inequality  between  1970  and  1992  (ﬁgure
3.10).27 They  also  argue  that  international

inequality  was  essentially  negligible  at  the
turn of the nineteenth century (accounting
for roughly 12 percent of global inequality),
but  that  it  increased  very  rapidly  until
World  War  II, and  then  continued  to
increase, but at a much slower pace. Within
country  inequality, however, reached  its
peak  around  1910  and  declined  dramati-
cally  between  the  two  world  wars  (mainly
because  of equalizing  forces  in  the  now-
developed  countries), and  started  creeping
back up only since the 1970s. The combined
effect of these changes is an increase in the
share  of
inequality  from
roughly 10 percent in 1820 to more than 60
percent by 1992.

In  summary, while  the  world  got  richer,
income  inequality—relative  and  absolute,
international and global—increased tremen-
dously  over  a 
time
(1820–1992). But  the  story  is  less  clear-cut
for  a  more  recent  time  frame.
In  the
post–World War II era, intercountry inequal-
ity  (unweighted)  has  continued  to  increase
while international inequality (weighted for
population)  declined.
in-
equality declined in the ﬁnal decades of the
twentieth  century, because  the  inequality-
reducing  effects  of
income  growth  in
China and South Asia more than offset the
inequality-boosting  effects  of continued
steady income growth in the now-developed
countries and the declining incomes in Sub-
Saharan Africa.

International 

Pritchett  (1997), examining  the  period
between  1870  and  1990, argues  that  while
there  was  convergence  of
incomes  for
today’s  developed  countries  (what  Maddi-
son  1995  calls  the  “advanced  capitalist”
countries), the growth rates between devel-
oped and developing economies show con-
siderable divergence. He provides evidence
that “the  growth  rates  of developed  coun-
tries are bunched in a narrow group, while
those  of less  developed  countries  are  all
over  with  some  in  explosive  growth  and
others in implosive decline.”28

Further evidence of convergence among
rich countries and divergence between rich
and  poor  countries  comes  from  Schultz
(1998), who  estimates  that  international
inequality accounted for about two-thirds
of total  inequality  (measured  by  log  vari-

ance)  between  1960  and  1990; however,
there also were large differences by region.
Inequality between the countries of OECD
(and the rest of Europe including Turkey)
decreased  by  50  percent  during  this
period, at the end accounting for only one-
third  of total  inequality. During  the  same
period,
international  inequality  in  Sub-
Saharan Africa nearly doubled, causing its
share  in  total  inequality  to  increase  from
20  percent  to  36  percent. In  both  Sub-
Saharan Africa and Latin America and the
Caribbean, overall inequality levels remain
high, while  high-income  countries  show
signs of convergence.

One can also examine inequality trends
by  focusing  on  the  mobility  of countries
rather  than  by  taking  an  anonymous
approach  to  inequality  comparisons. Poor
countries’ mobility  from  the  bottom  has
been limited in the past 25 years. With the
exception  of China, the  six  countries  that
occupied  the  bottom  decile  (population-
weighted)  in  1980—all  in  Sub-Saharan
Africa—had no growth worth noting.29

While there is signiﬁcant upward mobil-
ity between 1980 and 2002—the 97.08 per-
cent  entry  in  the  ﬁrst  row  of table  3.3  is
China—there  is  also  troubling  stagnation
and downward mobility. Note that approxi-
mately 8 percent of each of the second and
third  income  ranges  fell  into  the  bottom
range  over  these  two  decades. “It  is  clear
that no Pareto improvement has taken place
in the world between 1980 and 2002, which
leaves  room  for  different  value  judgments

about  the  evolution  of world  welfare,
inequality, and relative poverty.”30 Milanovic
(2005) also point out the “downward mobil-
ity” of many countries in the past 40 years or
so. Those  who  do  not  share  the  view  that
inequality between countries fell in the past
20 to 25 years—that is, those who take the
“unweighted” view of the world—may have
such mobility concerns in mind.

Absolute poverty rates have declined in
the  past  20  years  or  so, and  a  variety  of
studies  have  conﬁrmed  this  trend  (ﬁgure
3.11).31 Overall, while  there  are  roughly
400  million  fewer  people  who  live  on  less
than a $1 a day in 2001 than there were in
1981, the  number  of poor  people  in  Sub-
Saharan  Africa  almost  doubled,
from
approximately  160  million  to  313  million.

While  some  populous  countries, almost
exclusively  in  Asia, such  as  Bangladesh,
China, India, and  Pakistan, made  signiﬁ-
cant  headway  against  extreme  poverty,
almost  all  increases  in  extreme  poverty—
especially  in  countries  with  high  initial
headcount rates—took place in Sub-Saha-
ran  Africa.32 Among  the  larger  countries
with  rising  headcount  rates  are  Nigeria,
South Africa, and Tanzania.

If the poverty trends discussed here con-
tinue, the Millennium Development Goal of
halving  the  proportion  of people  living  on
less than $1 a day will be met. But only East
and South Asia will reach this goal. We can-
not be satisﬁed if this were to happen. Other
things  equal, we  would  prefer  to  see  the
poverty  rate  falling  at  the  same  pace  in  all
countries. Currently, hundreds  of millions
of people in numerous developing countries
lack the opportunity to avoid hunger, poor
health, and low access to vital services, such
as education and clean water.33

Global inequalities in power
One of the main arguments in the conclud-
ing  chapter  of this  report  is  that  the  rules
and  processes  in  global  markets  can  be
unfair to developing countries. A country’s
power  in  decision  making  in  multilateral
banks  is  usually  correlated  with  its  eco-
nomic  strength. Even  when  each  country
has equal representation in an international
body, such as the United Nations system or
the World Trade Organization (WTO), pow-
erful  forces  can  chisel  away  at  developing-
country  interests  (through  separate  bilat-
eral  agreements,
for  example). And  the
capacity  of developing  countries  to  make
informed decisions can be limited.

Poor countries lack the ﬁnancial and human
capital resources that would allow them to be
equal participants in the international bodies
in which decisions are taken that affect them
and, beyond  that, in  setting  the  rules  under
which the international system operates.34

In  the  International  Bank  for  Recon-
struction  and  Development  (IBRD)—the
market-lending arm of the World Bank—a
country’s voting power depends on the per-
centage of IBRD shares it holds. The largest
shareholders are the United States with 16.4

percent of the vote, Japan with 7.9 percent,
Germany  with  4.5  percent, France  and  the
United Kingdom with 4.3 percent. Each has a
representative on the Board of Directors. By
contrast, all Sub-Saharan countries together
have two representatives and 5.2 percent of
the  vote. China  and  India  both  have  2.8
percent  of the  vote.35 Country  inﬂuence  in
setting  the  agenda  for  the  institutions  is  not
limited to board membership. A 1998 study by
Filmer and others (1998) shows that roughly
two-thirds  of the  senior  management–level
positions at the World Bank are occupied by
citizens of Part I (mainly OECD) countries,
although  these  countries  account  for  less
than one-ﬁfth of the global population and
a  smaller  share  of the  number  of member
countries.

At the WTO, each member country has
one  vote. Moreover, because  decisions  are
by  consensus, each  country  effectively  has
veto  power. So  the  WTO  is, at  least  on
paper, perhaps  the  most  democratic  of
international organizations. In practice, the
ability of countries to inﬂuence the agenda
and  decisions  depends  crucially  on  their
capacity  to  be  present, to  follow  negotia-
tions, to  be  informed, and  to  understand
fully  the  impact  of the  complex  issues  at
hand. A  rough  indicator  of a  country’s
capacity  is  the  size  of its  representation  in
Geneva. A  study  by  Blackhurst, Lyakurwa,
and Oyejide (2000) found that only 8 of the
38 Sub-Saharan countries had close to ﬁve
(the WTO average) resident delegates listed
in the WTO directory. Worse, 19 of the 38
countries—half of the  Sub-Saharan  WTO
membership—had  no  delegate  resident  in
Geneva. Only Nigeria had a delegation that
deals solely with the WTO.36

Even when country representation in the
international arena is considered adequate,
it  is  debatable  whether  the  representatives
of some  countries  are  fully  accountable  to
their citizens. There are considerable differ-
ences  among  countries  in  the  extent  to
which  their  political  and  legal  institutions
provide  citizens  with  fair, transparent, and
inclusive  environments  to  enhance  and
leverage their assets. While there are numer-
ous problems with trying to measure such
things, Kaufmann, Kraay, and  Mastruzzi

Note: “Voice and accountability” refers broadly to the extent to
which citizens have freedom of expression, a free press, and open
elections based on a statistical compilation of responses on the
quality of governance given by a large number of enterprise, citi-
zen, and expert survey respondents in industrial and developing
countries, as reported by a number of survey institutes, think tanks,
nongovernmental organizations, and international organizations.
Countries’ relative positions on these indicators are subject to
margins of error that are clearly indicated. Consequently, precise
country rankings should not be inferred from these data.

the

Figure 3.12 summarizes information on
“voice  and  accountability,” which  refers
broadly to the extent to which citizens have
freedom  of expression, a  free  press, and
open  elections, using  standardized  meas-
ures for selected countries (the same ones as
in ﬁgure 3.6). The upper bar for each coun-
try represents the country’s percentile rank
in  the “voice  and  accountability” distribu-
tion  with  the  intersecting  black  rule  line
representing  the  conﬁdence  interval. The
lower bar is the average percentile score for
the  income  category  to  which  the  country
belongs.37 The top of the “voice” rankings is

mark, the United States, Ireland, and Israel.
The  voice  ranking  of such  countries  as
South  Africa, Poland, and  especially  Mali
and  India  exceed  their  ranks  in  incomes.
The  opposite  is  true  for  China, Ethiopia,
Pakistan, and the Russian Federation. Cam-
bodia and the Republic of Yemen are both
quite  poor  and  rank  low  in  freedom  of
expression. It is clear that there is no one-
to-one  relationship  between  citizens’ voice
and average income at the country level.

A glimpse of the future
Despite improvements over time, inequali-
ties among countries in various dimensions
remain  unacceptably  high. Each  year  10.5
million child deaths are preventable in the
sense  that  these  children  would  not  have
died  if they  had  been  born  in  rich  coun-
tries.38 The  mean  educational  attainment
level  for  adults  born  in  1975–79  in  Sub-
Saharan  Africa  remains  at  5.4  years, com-
pared with 10.1 years in Latin America and
Caribbean  and  13.4  years  in  developed
countries. Developing  countries  also  face
massive challenges in inﬂuencing the global
rules  and  processes  that  determine  out-
comes, which  matter  greatly  to  the  well-
being of their citizens.

in 

improvements 

International inequalities in educational
attainment  have  been  steadily  declining.
This  is  also  true  in  health—one’s  country
of birth 50 years ago was much more perti-
nent  to  survival  than  it  is  today. In  this
sense, opportunities  across  countries  are
equalizing. But 
life
expectancy at birth have reversed since the
early  1990s, because  of
the  devastating
effects  of HIV/AIDS  and  the  difﬁcult  cir-
cumstances  facing  citizens  of some  transi-
tion  economies. The  world  distribution  of
incomes, by  contrast, was  becoming  secu-
larly  more  unequal  from  the  early  nine-
teenth century until about the end of World
War  II. Since  the  war,
international  in-
equality  between  countries  has  decreased
immensely, because  of the  fast  growth  in
China and India in more recent times, and
global  inequality  has  leveled  off. Because
China  and  India  are  only  two  countries,
intercountry inequality in incomes has con-
tinued to increase.

What explains the convergence in health
and education and the lack of it in incomes?
Deaton (2004) points out that, while gains
in income were undoubtedly important for
improving  nutrition  and  funding  better
water  and  sanitation  schemes, some  coun-
tries made progress in reducing child mor-
tality  even  in  the  absence  of economic
growth. These  improvements  came  from
the  globalization  of knowledge, facilitated
by local political, economic, and education
conditions. A  possible  explanation  for  the
disconnect  between  the  convergence  in
education and the divergence in incomes is
that  education 
into
human  capital  and  that  the  rise  in  per
worker schooling explains only a small part
of the growth in output per worker.39

is  not  translating 

We have seen that the story of income
inequality in the world has been a story of
falling  international  inequalities  and  ris-
ing within-country inequality. For global in-
equality, these two effects are offsetting, and
the  conclusion  drawn  depends  on  knowing
which effect dominated. The decline in inter-
national  inequality  is  largely  due  to  fast
income growth in China and South Asia.40
But as China and South Asia catch up to the
world  average, their  equalizing  effect  will
diminish. And if they continue to develop at
similar rates to that in the past two decades,
the effect of their growth will increase inter-
national inequality.41 Without the offsetting
effect of declining international inequality,
global inequality would also be on the rise
again  unless  inequality  within  countries
starts  to  decline  and  Sub-Saharan  African
economies  begin  to  experience  healthy
growth. This  suggests  that  the  future  of
world  income  inequality  will  increasingly
be a function of economic growth in Africa
(and  some  other  low-income  countries
under  stress), especially  if the  population
growth  rates  in  Africa  remain  above  the
world  average. That  both  population
growth and economic growth in Africa have
been stunted by the AIDS tragedy is doubly
disturbing.

On whether today’s poor countries with
stagnant  economies  will  take  off, some
researchers  are  optimistic. Lucas  (2003)
suggests that the countries that have not yet
joined  the  industrial  revolution  (which  he

Equity from a global perspective

69

attributes to socialist planning, lawlessness,
and  corruption)  will  become  the  miracle
economies  of the  future. He  reckons  that
the growth rates in these catch-up countries
may be quite high and that they will also go
through  a  similar  demographic  transition
experienced by today’s developed countries.
The  world  population  will  stop  rising  and
world production growth will stabilize until
all countries, economically, start resembling
countries  like  the  United  States, thanks  to
free trade and the diffusion of technology.

Pritchett—who calls this idea “advantage
to  backwardness”42—remains  more  cau-
tious. Conceding  that  such  rapid  gains  in
productivity are a possibility, he argues that
“the cases in which backward countries, and
especially the most backward of countries,
actually gain signiﬁcantly on the leader are
historically  rare.”43 He  observes  that  there
are  also  forces  for  “implosive” declines  in
these  countries, suggesting  that  backward-
ness may also carry “severe disadvantages.”
On  health  in  Sub-Saharan  Africa, the
UN  Population  Division  projects  that  life
expectancy  at  birth  in  Africa  will  decline
over  the  next  5  to  10  years  and  then  start
climbing again, reaching 65 years by about
2050.44 These  projections  assume  that
HIV/AIDS  prevalence  rates  in  Africa  will
peak  sometime  before  2010  and  then
decline over the next decades. But the Joint
United  Nations  Programme  on  HIV/AIDS
estimated  that  43  percent  of pregnant
females  in  2000  were  HIV  positive  in
Botswana and 19 percent in South Africa.45

Thus, millions of babies are being infected
at  birth, which  is  mostly  preventable  with
proper  interventions. Life  expectancy  in
Africa  would  not  improve  much, and  cer-
tainly not soon, if these assumed improve-
ments in HIV/AIDS prevalence rates do not
materialize.

Because South Asia has almost caught up
to the world average in life expectancy, Sub-
Saharan Africa will be the only region signif-
icantly affecting health inequalities between
countries, barring a major catastrophe else-
where.46 So, improvements in life expectancy
in Sub-Saharan Africa are the key to future
declines in international health inequalities.
Chapter  2  documented  within-country
inequalities in health opportunities for chil-
dren born to poor or rich parents, educated
or  uneducated  mothers, in  rural  or  urban
areas, and  so  on. Steep  gradients  in  health
opportunities  and  outcomes  exist  along
these dimensions in many countries. A conﬁ-
dent assessment of past and future trends in
health inequality awaits future research.

If the  trends  that  brought  about  the
catching up of many poor countries outside
of Africa continue in health, education, and
incomes, the biggest challenges will remain
in Africa and some poor countries in other
regions. Growth  with  equity  needs  to  be
revived in stagnating economies around the
world, and  the  AIDS  tragedy  (along  with
the  folly  of preventable  diseases)  needs  to
be  addressed  urgently, especially  in  Sub-
Saharan  Africa. These  remain  the  biggest
global challenges in development today.

empowerment

Popular participation and equitable transitions at the local level 
Promoting equity through public action requires changes in the existing conﬁgurations of power and inﬂuence. Because
established institutions privilege certain interests and marginalize others, making governance institutions more
democratic and more equity-enhancing calls for reforms that increase the possibilities for effective participation by tradi-
tionally marginalized groups.

Local government is a critical domain

for the exercise of democratic rights
and  for  making  effective  public
choices. But several factors have conspired
against  good  governance, democracy, and
equity  at  the  local  level  in  much  of the
developing world. The social and economic
power  of local  elites  has  often  translated
into  disproportionate  inﬂuence  over  the
political  process, and  top-down, insulated,
and 
decision-making
structures  have  made  it  difﬁcult  for  ordi-
nary  citizens  to  have  voice.1 Democratic
deepening  in  the  developing  world  often
begins  with  the  democratization  of local
government, and that is precisely what two
participatory governance initiatives—in the
Indian  state  of Kerala  and  in  a  variety  of
municipalities in Brazil—have tried to do.

nontransparent 

In 1996 the state government of Kerala
launched  what  is  widely  viewed  to  be  the
most  ambitious  initiative  for  democratic
decentralization in India: the People’s Cam-
paign of Decentralized Planning. The gov-
ernment  not  only  devolved  signiﬁcant
resources  and  authority  to  Kerala’s  1,214
panchayats  (village  councils)  and  munici-
palities, but it also promoted direct citizen
participation  by  mandating  village  assem-
blies  and  citizen  committees  to  plan  and
budget local development expenditures.

In  Brazil,

the  city  of Porto  Alegre
launched  a  participatory  budgeting  initia-
tive in 1990 that has since been copied in at
least  400  municipalities  throughout  the
country. The process begins with neighbor-
hood  assemblies  in  which  citizens  deliber-
ate  and  set  budgeting  priorities, and  ends
with a citywide budget formulated by dele-
gates  directly  elected  by  neighborhood
assemblies. The success in Porto Alegre has
seen  its  steady  diffusion, with  at  least  100
municipalities, including São Paulo, imple-
menting variations of participatory budget-
ing in 1996–2000, and some estimated 250
municipalities in 2000–04.

These two initiatives have much in com-
mon. They  were  both  conceived  as  direct
and  conscious  efforts  to  break  with  the
elite-dominated and clientelistic politics of
local government by promoting redistribu-
tive policies through broad popular partici-
pation. Thus, they both shifted the political
opportunity  structure  and  involved  action
to  strengthen  the  agency  of subordinate
groups.2 Both  have,
in  effect, comple-
mented representative forms of democracy
with  participatory  forms  of democracy  by
opening  institutions  to  the  direct  engage-
ment  of civil  society. And  both  have
strengthened  public  authority  and  public
action  by  increasing  both  the  depth  and
scope of democratic decision making.

Deepening democracy
The  evidence  shows  that  these  initiatives
have  deepened  democracy, expanding  the
range  of social  actors  participating  in  the
political  arena. In  Porto  Alegre, an  esti-
mated  100,000  adults  have  participated  at
some  point  in  the  budgeting  assemblies.
Other  cities  that  have  adopted  some  form
of the process have also experienced active
participation,
including  municipalities
without  established  civil  societies.
In
Kerala, nearly  one  in  four  households
attended village assemblies in the ﬁrst two
years  of the  campaign, and  despite  rou-
tinization  of
the  process  in  subsequent
years, these  assemblies  continue  to  draw
large  numbers. Hundreds  of thousands  of
citizens  have  undergone  training  in  plan-
ning  and  budgeting, and  the  committees
that  actually  design  and  budget  speciﬁc
projects  have  been  composed  primarily  of
civil society actors.

A redesign of institutional incentives and
new  mobilizational  efforts  saw  women
account for 40 percent of the participants in
village assemblies (a level otherwise unheard
of in India) and the participation rate of dal-
its  (scheduled  castes)  has  exceeded  their

representation in the population.3 Moreover,
both  these  initiatives  have  created  a  new
cadre of grassroots politicians who either did
not exist before (delegates in Brazil) or who
previously  had  no  powers  (the  14,000
elected panchayat councilors in Kerala). The
local public sphere—the sine qua non of any
vibrant  democracy—has  become  more
extensive, more  inclusive, and  more  mean-
ingful.

Extending democracy
These  initiatives  have  been  marked  by  the
extension of democracy, speciﬁcally public
decision making in arenas of authority pre-
viously  dominated  by  private  and  state
elites. Municipal budgets in Brazil have long
been the preserve of oligarchic parties and
narrow  sectoral  interests. Panchayats  in
Kerala have long been little more than pas-
sive 
top-down  projects
designed and delivered by state bureaucra-
cies. In both cases, citizens now have a voice
in  determining  how  public  resources  are
allocated. In the most successful participa-
tory  budgeting  cases, the  entire  budget  of
the municipality is discussed and approved
by delegates acting on priorities established
by  neighborhood  assemblies, with  citizens
deliberating on capital and operational seg-
ments of the budget.

recipients  of

In  some  municipalities, direct  partici-
pation  has  been  extended  to  thematic
areas, such  as  economic  development,
public  transportation, education, social
services, and  urban  planning. In  Kerala,
panchayats  have  been  given  authority  for
up  to  35  percent  of
the  development
budget,
their
resources  base. Panchayats  have  ranked,
designed, and  implemented  hundreds  of
projects a year across all development sec-
tors. These have included housing for the
poor, small-scale  irrigation,
local  roads
and  infrastructure, agricultural  projects,
support  services  in  health  and  education,

a

and  a  range  of projects  specifically  tar-
geted at women and dalits.

Enhancing equity
These initiatives have generally had equity-
enhancing effects. In Porto Alegre, the best
known and most documented case, there is
clear evidence that expenditures on poorer
areas of the city increased steadily with the
introduction of participatory budgeting. In
other large cities with participatory budget-
ing, such  as  Belém  and  Belo  Horizonte,
expenditures have also targeted the poor. A
statistical  analysis  of all  Brazilian  munici-
palities in 1997–2000 revealed that partici-
patory  budgeting  cities  had  signiﬁcantly
higher  expenditures  on  sectors  that  affect
the poor most directly.4

In Kerala, a large survey of key respon-
dents  found  that  “disadvantaged” groups
were  the  prime  beneﬁciaries  of targeted
schemes. Case studies show that panchayats
have  emphasized  the  need  to  bring  all
households  up  to  a  certain  basic  level  of
well-being, with a heavy emphasis on pro-
viding sanitation facilities, decent housing,
and safe water to needy families.

In both cases, there is also strong evidence
that the incidence of rent-seeking has fallen
sharply.5 The  greater  transparency  of the
budgeting process alone has raised the trans-
action costs of predation and patronage.

Empowering the most 
marginal groups
The Kerala and Porto Alegre cases illustrate
the  value  of improving  the  accessibility,
transparency, and  accountability  of local
government. However, even when such ini-
tiatives  have  been  undertaken, and  where

the  economy  is  otherwise  growing, the
most marginalized social groups—widows,
slum dwellers, sex workers, the very poor—
may continue to be excluded. What can be
done?  The  challenge  is  greater  when  the
extent  of commitment  from  above  and
mobilization  from  below  is  less  than  in
these two cases.

the 

regarding 

As discussed in chapter 2, the most mar-
ginal groups are often stuck in more severe
forms  of an “inequality  trap”—a  situation
characterized  by  dire  material  circum-
stances, rational expectations about limited
mobility  opportunities, and  internalized
beliefs 
legitimacy  and
immutability of their circumstances. Break-
ing  out  of
such  inequality  traps  and
improving the terms by which the poor are
“recognized” by others starts with building
both  a  “capacity  to  aspire” and, equally
important, a  “capacity  to  engage.”6 This
includes  being  able  to  envision  and  enact
alternative futures, believing that it is desir-
able  and  possible  to  move  out  of poverty,
and  being  able  to  more  meaningfully  par-
ticipate in forums where decisions affecting
their welfare are made.

Acquiring a “capacity to aspire” is largely
a  product  of developing  more  broadly
accessible  and  equitable  mechanisms  for
interaction  between  the  poor  and  elites,
mechanisms that are reciprocally linked to
attaining  greater  voice  in  associational
interactions. It  thrives  in  and  through
group organizing and public dialogue, and
the opportunities these afford for practice,
repetition, exploration, conjecture, and
refutation.

An association of sex workers in a Cal-
cutta slum, for example, gave its individual
members  a  voice, a  public  presence, and  a

capacity to realize their interests and aspira-
tions  that  would  have  been  denied  them
otherwise.7 Young,
female, often  illegal
immigrants, contractually  bound  to  work
long  hours  for  ruthless  bosses, and  facing
sure rejection by their families if they man-
aged  to  escape  and  return  home, the  sex
workers  had  virtually  no  capacity  to  exer-
cise  their  voices  and  realize  their  interests.
Persistent  efforts  to  organize  the  women
into a union, however, eventually gave them
the  conﬁdence  and  competence  to  bring
about a change in condom use by clients.

In  Indonesia, the  Kecamatan  Develop-
ment  Project  (KDP), which  operates  in
28,000 villages across the country, seeks to
improving  the “terms  of recognition” and
political  agency  of marginalized  groups. 8
The  project  allocates  grant  money  at  the
subdistrict level, for which several groups of
poor  villagers  (two  of whom  must  be
women)  are  invited  to  compete  for  funds
on the basis of the presentation of a formal
subproject  proposal. KDP’s  procedures,
institutions, and  norms  are  largely  decen-
tralized, they focus on joint public problem
solving, they invite broad public participa-
tion and scrutiny, and they occur in a more
or  less  continuous  and  institutionalized
way.9

Recent  work  assessing  the  impact  of
KDP  on  local  decision  making  ﬁnds  that
KDP  helps  marginalized  groups  cultivate
access to more constructive spaces and pro-
cedures  for  addressing  project  and  non-
project  conﬂicts.10 The  beginning  stage  of
such  a  transformation—in  which  unequal
groups  build  the  capacity  to  peacefully
engage one another—is a humble but non-
trivial outcome for a development project.

Why does equity matter?

IIP A R T

IN THE FIRST PART OF THIS REPORT, WE SUMMARIZED some of the evi-
dence  on  inequalities  in  several  dimensions. In  addition  to  affecting
well-being  directly, such  dimensions  as  health, education, income,
voice, and  access  to  services  shape  the  opportunities  people  face  for
future progress and achievement. We emphasized the interconnections
between these various dimensions. Not only is there inequality in the
distributions  of income, health  status, and  educational  attainment,
but—even  more  important—these  indicators  tend  to  be  correlated.
The  rich  tend  to  be  both  healthier  and  better  educated  than  others.
The poorest of the poor tend to have the lowest attainment in years of
schooling and some of the worst health indicators. These correlations
generally also extend to public services, with the poor gaining access to
infrastructure, electricity, water, sanitation, and garbage disposal much
later than others, if at all.

Because education and wealth help a person gain inﬂuence in soci-
ety, voice and political power are also generally thought to be correlated
with  economic  well-being. The  interaction  between  these  mutually
reinforcing  economic, social, and  political  inequalities  perpetuates
them across generations. Chapter 2 discussed evidence indicating that a
10 percent difference in economic status between two families in one
generation tends to imply, on average, a 4 percent to 7 percent differ-
ence in the next generation, depending on the country and measure-
ment  details. Opportunities  clearly  are  not  independent  from  social
and family background, or from group identity.

Do such disparities matter? Are people concerned with the large
observed  differences  in  access  to  education  and  health, and  in  eco-
nomic opportunities, or merely with the fact that some people have
low absolute levels of income, years of schooling, and access to serv-
ices?  Should  policymakers  worry  about  the  unequal  opportunities

74

that  arise  from  discrimination, unequal
access  to  justice  or  other  unfair  processes?
Should an institution like the World Bank,
whose primary objective is to assist its client
countries  in  eradicating  extreme  poverty,
care  about  inequalities—in  opportunities,
outcomes, and processes—at all?

Opinions  on  these  questions  are  wide-
ranging. Support  for  equal  opportunities
has long been a theme in domestic policy
in the United States, for instance. Franklin
D. Roosevelt once said that “We know that
equality  of
individual  ability  has  never
existed and never will, but we do insist that
equality  of opportunity  still  must  be
sought.” 1 Some participants in the consul-
tations for this report were even offended
that  the  question  “Does  inequality  mat-
ter?” was asked at all, because they consid-
ered its answer to be “Obviously, yes.” One
participant felt that the very question indi-
cated that “we are suffering [from] a terri-
ble tolerance to horror.”2

The  next  three  chapters  in  this  report
address  the  following  question:
should
good  development  policy  be  concerned
with equity? Equity, as discussed in chapter
1, is understood here as the pursuit of equal
opportunities  and  the  avoidance  of severe
deprivation. Equity is not the same as equal-
ity in incomes, or in health status, or in any
other speciﬁc outcome. It is the quest for a
situation  in  which  personal  effort, prefer-
ences, and  initiative—rather  than  family
background,
race, or  gender—
account for the differences among people’s
economic  achievements. A  situation  in
which  all  institutions  are  color-blind  and
nonmarket institutions are equally respon-
sive to the rich and the poor. In which per-
sonal  and  property  rights  are  enforced
equally for all. And in which all have access
to the public services and the infrastructure
to  leverage  their  productivity  and  their
chances of success in the markets.

caste,

The  evidence  we  review  here  has  been
assembled in disciplines ranging from eco-
nomics  and  history  to  sociology  and
anthropology. On  balance, this  evidence
suggests  that  the  pursuit  of sustainable,
long-term prosperity is inseparable from a
broadening of economic opportunities and

political voice to most or all of society. One
set of reasons for this arises from failures in
capital, land, and labor markets. Those fail-
ures  imply  that  productive  opportunities
are not necessarily seized by those with the
highest potential returns on their talents or
ideas, but  instead  by  those  with  greater
wealth, better  connections, or  larger  land
parcels. This  would  not  happen  if markets
worked perfectly, as resources would ﬂow to
those with the most productive investment
projects. But given that markets are not per-
fect, scope arises for efﬁcient redistribution
schemes.

Chapter  5  documents  cases  in  which
aggregate  efﬁciency  could  be  improved  by
redistributing  wealth  or  power  toward
poorer or marginal groups. Sometimes, the
evidence  of inefﬁciency  is  seen  in  differ-
ences in marginal products of capital across
ﬁrms. We know that smaller entrepreneurs
pay  interest  rates  much  higher  than  the
marginal  product  of capital  accruing  to
other  ﬁrms. We  know  that  some  farmers
allocate effort between plots in a way that is
not socially efﬁcient, because they own one
plot  and  sharecrop  in  another. We  have
experimental  evidence 
that
groups  discriminated  against  perform
below  their  own  capacity, either  because
they  internalize  the  stereotype  or  because
they  expect  to  be  treated  unfairly. Each  of
these pieces of carefully researched empiri-
cal evidence, and others discussed in chap-
ter  5, provide  reasons  why  more  equitable
economies  would, in  most  cases, also  be
more efﬁcient.3

suggesting 

Chapter  6  complements  this  picture  by
looking  at  historical  evidence, suggesting
that large inequalities in political rights and
power  give  rise  to  exclusionary  institutions
that generally impair development processes.
Greater political equality, by contrast, estab-
lishes limits on predation by the most pow-
erful  in  each  society. This  tends  to  lead  to
institutions  that  level  the  playing  ﬁeld  and
provide opportunities for advancement and
mobility  to  those  from  underprivileged
backgrounds.

Such  institutions  seem  to  be  associated
with more sustained growth. One example
comes  from  contrasting  the  exploitative

Why does equity matter?

labor  practices  of the  Spanish  conquista-
dores in the mining centers of their Ameri-
can colonies from the sixteenth to the eigh-
teenth  century, with  the  greater  freedom
and opportunity afforded to early settlers in
North  America. Another  example  of
inequitable  treatment  of citizens  by  the
state, which was also enormously costly for
efﬁciency, was  the  very  high  taxation  of
poor  African  farmers  by  state-owned  or
parastatal agricultural marketing boards in
Ghana, Nigeria, and  Zambia, which  pre-
vailed a few decades ago.

Equity  and  fairness  matter  not  only
because  they  are  complementary  to  long-
term  prosperity. It  is  evident  that  many
people—if not  most—care  about  equity
for its own sake. Some see equal opportu-
nities  and  fair  processes  as  matters  of
social justice and thus as an intrinsic part
of the objective of development. In chapter
4, we  briefly  review  arguments  and  evi-
dence  suggesting 
that  most  societies
exhibit a pervasive and long-standing con-
cern for equity.

Equity and well-being

4c h a p t e r

People from many cultures seem to share a
concern  for  equity  that  is  reﬂected  in  reli-
gious  and  philosophical  traditions, as  well
as  in  legal  institutions, both  national  and
international. Religions from Islam to Bud-
dhism and secular philosophical traditions
from Plato to Sen have shown both a con-
cern for equity and an aversion to absolute
deprivation. In  modern  legal  institutions,
equity remains a fundamental tenet of the-
ory and practice.

That a concern with equity is so pervasive
across  cultures, religions, and  philosophical
traditions suggests that a fundamental pref-
erence for fairness is deeply rooted in human
beings. We  review  experimental  evidence
showing that many people place a monetary
value on “fairness” and are prepared to give
up real money if they feel that a process they
are involved in is unfair. Complementing this
evidence are data from opinion surveys, and
surveys on subjective well-being, suggesting
that higher inequality in incomes is, on aver-
age, associated with lower aggregate levels of
subjective well-being.

link  between 

if

An  empirical 

income
inequality and poverty reduction reinforces
the conceptual link between the aversion to
inequality  and  the  quest  to  avoid  absolute
deprivation. We  highlight  the  obvious  fact
that,
inequality  falls  during  a  growth
spell, poverty generally falls by more than if
inequality had not changed. We also docu-
ment  the  less  obvious  fact  that  higher-
income inequality reduces the effectiveness
of
future  economic  growth  in  reducing
absolute income poverty.

Ethical and philosophical
approaches to equity
Perhaps the oldest manifestations of concern
with equity and the avoidance of deprivation

76

come from religion. Several major world reli-
gions  endorse  the  notions  of social  justice
and a duty toward the poor. Buddhists see a
duty  to  care  for  the  poor. Christians  are  to
“love  their  neighbor  as  themselves.” The
Hebrew word for “charity” is the same as the
one for “justice.” One of Islam’s ﬁve pillars of
faith  is  zakat, providing  for  the  poor  and
needy. The World  Faiths  Development  Dia-
logue  (1999)  states  that “all  religions  would
see the extreme material poverty in the world
today as a moral indictment to contemporary
humanity  and  a  breach  of trust  within  the
human family.” And religious views on equity
are not restricted to poverty. Despite varying
interpretations, and a wealth of differences in
perspective, a belief in the fundamental dig-
nity of human beings is a theological tenet in
most major religions. While there are impor-
tant  differences  in  how  this  belief manifests
itself across faiths, and even among different
groups within the main religions, some ana-
lysts see a growing emphasis on this principle
of equality within various faiths.1

Equity  is  also  a  key  theme  in  secular
philosophical  traditions. Western  political
and  ethical  philosophy, for  instance, has
long  been  concerned  with  distribution. In
ancient Greece, Plato argued that “if a state
is to avoid . . . civil disintegration . . . extreme
poverty and wealth must not be allowed to
rise  in  any  section  of
the  citizen-body,
because both lead to disasters.”2 Roman law,
while discriminating against slaves, as in all
ancient  empires, also  laid  the  foundations
for  some  of the  principles  of equality  that
underlie  modern  legal  principles  in  many
countries. Those  principles  applied  only  to
Roman citizens who were free, but in mod-
ern nations they have become all-inclusive.
In  the  modern  era, Western  thinking
about  social  justice  was  greatly  inﬂuenced
by utilitarianism—the idea, originally from

Equity and well-being

77

Bentham (1789), that the social goal should
be to achieve “the greatest happiness for the
greatest  number.” Although  utilitarians
were essentially unconcerned with the dis-
tribution  of happiness, enjoining  societies
simply  to  maximize  the  sum  of utilities
across  all  individuals, the  approach  has
earned  the  somewhat  misbegotten  reputa-
tion (at least among economists) of having
egalitarian implications.3

Modern  theories  of distributive  justice
have largely moved beyond utilitarianism, in
part because of its fundamental lack of con-
cern with the distribution of welfare. Since the
early 1970s, a number of inﬂuential thinkers,
including  John  Rawls, Amartya  Sen, Ronald
Dworkin, and John Roemer, have made sepa-
rate and important contributions to the way
we think about equity. Although the theories
of justice and social choice proposed by each
of them  are  different  in  important  respects,
they share much in common.

All four reject ﬁnal welfare (or utility) as
the appropriate space in which to judge the
fairness of a given allocation or system. All
acknowledge  the  importance  of individual
responsibility  in  moving  from  resources  to
ﬁnal outcomes, including welfare. All prefer
to see some combination of the set of liber-
ties and resources available to individuals as
the  right  space  to  form  a  social  judgment.
All seem to appeal, at some stage, to the “veil
of
from  Harsanyi
(1955), that  a  fair  allocation  of resources
should be one that all “prospective members
of society” would agree on, before they knew
which  position  they  would  occupy. They
used this thought experiment to argue that
justice  implies  equality  in  the  allocation  to
all  people  of some  fundamental  concept,
such as primary goods.

ignorance” argument,

What  Rawls, Sen, Dworkin, and  Roemer
disagree on is what exactly this concept should
be. Rawls  (1971)  argued  that  social  justice
required  that  two  basic  principles  should
hold. The  ﬁrst “demands  the  most  extensive
liberty for each, consistent with similar liberty
for others.”4 The second requires that oppor-
tunities—which he related to the concept of
“primary  goods”—should  be  open  to  all
members  of society. Under  the  Difference
Principle, he proposes that the chosen alloca-
tion should be one that maximizes the oppor-

tunities  of the  least  privileged  group. (The
Difference Principle is also known as Rawls’s
“maximin” principle).

Sen  (1985)  thought  that  different  peo-
ple  might  have  different  “conversion  fac-
tors” from  resources  to  actions  and  wel-
fare. He  argued  that  all  goods, including
Rawls’ “primary  goods,” are  inputs  to  a
person’s functionings—the set of actions a
person  performs  and  of states  the  person
values or enjoys. For Sen, the concept to be
equalized across people is the set of possi-
ble  functionings  from  which  a  person
might be able to choose (which he called a
“capability set”).

Dworkin (1981b) and Dworkin (1981a)
argued that justice required that individuals
should be compensated for aspects of their
circumstances over which they had no con-
trol, or  for  which  they  could  not  be  held
responsible. He argued for a distribution of
resources  that  compensated  people  for
innate differences that they could not have
helped, including differences in talent.

Roemer  (1998)  argued 

that  equity
demanded an “equal opportunity policy.” He
acknowledged  that  individuals  bear  some
responsibility for their own welfare, but also
that circumstances over which they have no
control  affect  both  how  much  effort  they
invest and the level of welfare they eventu-
ally  attain. He  argued  that  public  action
should  therefore  aim  to  equalize  “advan-
tages” among people from groups with dif-
ferent  circumstances  at  every  point  along
the distribution of efforts within the group.
Despite  important  (but  subtle)  differ-
ences, all four thinkers have contributed to
shifting the focus of social justice from out-
comes to opportunities. We also take a leaf
from Nozick (1974), who is usually regarded
as an anti-egalitarian. He argued that theo-
ries of justice generally placed an excessive
emphasis  on  outcomes, such  as  welfare,
utility, or even capabilities. Nozick reminded
us  of the  (obvious)  fact  that  outcomes  are
the result of processes and argued that the
correct focus for a theory of justice should
be on the fairness of processes. If a particu-
lar  allocation  departs  from  a  fair  initial
state, and  is  arrived  at  through  a  fair
process, it  should  be  judged  to  be  fair—
even if it is unequal.

B O X   4 . 1 A simple representation of different concepts 

of equity

The ﬁgure below (adapted from ﬁgure 11-1 in
Atkinson and Stiglitz 1980),* can help sum-
marize what this report hopes to achieve—
and what it does not.Suppose that a society
consists of only two groups of people (1 and
2) and let the axes of the diagram depict the
opportunity levels of each group.Opportu-
nity sets are obviously multidimensional, but
imagine for simplicity that the various dimen-
sions can be meaningfully conﬂated onto an
“opportunity index,”O1 for type 1s, and O2 for
type 2s.Now let the curved frontier AC repre-
sent the “opportunity possibility frontier”for
this society.** It reﬂects the maximum oppor-
tunity indexes that types 1 and 2 can obtain,
given the available resources and technology.
The fact that it does not monotonically
decline from A to C incorporates the fact that
when type 1 individuals have very limited
opportunities, type 2 people can also beneﬁt
from an expansion in type 1 opportunity sets,
and vice versa.Over some ranges, improve-
ments in the opportunity sets of the “poor-
est”types can be Pareto-improving—that is,
can beneﬁt everyone.Put another way, there
is scope for efﬁcient, growth-promoting redis-
tribution.

Eventually, however, tradeoffs set in.

Between points P and R, if society is on the
opportunity possibility frontier, any
improvement in type 1 sets must imply a
reduction in type 2 sets, and vice-versa.
Points B, R, and E are translations to this
“opportunity space” of the welfare concepts
associated with Bentham, Rawls, and full
egalitarianism, respectively.

•

If this society wished to maximize the
sum of total opportunity indexes, it
should aim for point B.

•

•

If, instead, it wanted to maximize the
opportunity set of the “poorest” group, it
should aim for point R.
If it insisted on absolute equality of
opportunities, it must lie along the 45-
degree ray through the origin, and would
aim for point E.

What this report will not attempt to do
is to advise countries on which of these cri-
teria of social justice, or indeed any other, an
individual society should aim for. Each of
these three points can be defended by logi-
cal arguments, under different degrees of
aversion to inequalities in opportunity.

What the report will try to do is as follows:

• Describe the inequalities in opportunity

•

actually observed in society (at a point
such as X).
Investigate whether some of those dis-
parities (which in this diagram greatly
favor type 2) might actually be prevent-
ing the society from enjoying higher
aggregate opportunities (and welfare, on
another space).

• Suggest possible policy and institutional
approaches that might help move from
points such as X to whichever point soci-
ety considers equitable, on the opportu-
nity possibility frontier.

*Atkinson and Stiglitz (1980) refer, in turn, to a
ﬁgure 1 in Buchanan (1976).
**In Atkinson and Stiglitz (1980), utilities are
used instead of opportunities.While that dis-
tinction is fundamental in almost every
respect, it is not for the point being made here,
namely that different social justice criteria
imply different optimal allocations.

The  concept  of equity  we  adopt  in  this
report  draws  on  the  contribution  of these
four thinkers by focusing on opportunities,
rather  than  on  welfare, utilities, or  some
other  corresponding  individual  outcome.
We  do  not  dwell  on  the  ﬁne  distinctions
between  Sen’s  capabilities  and  Roemer’s
opportunities. As  in  both  frameworks, we
acknowledge  the  central  role  of individual
responsibility and effort in determining out-
comes. We  focus  on  eliminating  disadvan-
tage  from  circumstances  that  lie  largely
beyond the control of the individual but that
powerfully shape both the outcomes and the
actions in pursuit of those outcomes.

These  different  perspectives  on  what  a
social optimum should be can shed light on
an  important  point  for  this  report—one
previously mentioned in chapter 1. It is not
for  us  to  advise  countries  on  what  exactly
constitutes  an  equitable  distribution  in
their societies. Instead, our role is to point
out  the  inequities  we  can  observe  and  to
note  that  reducing  them  may  be  perfectly
consistent  with—perhaps  even  necessary
for—greater efﬁciency and prosperity in the
long run. Box 4.1 draws on a classic public
economics  discussion  of these  philosophi-
cal perspectives to illustrate this point.

Equity and legal institutions
The  concerns  with  equity  that  feature  in
moral, religious, and ethical debates around
the world are reﬂected in real-world institu-
tions, through which people have sought to
promote  justice  throughout  history. Chief
among  them  are  legal  institutions, where
“equity” has a distinct—and speciﬁc—inter-
pretation  as  a  set  of principles  intended  to
guide and correct the application of the law.
According to Kritzer (2002), how these prin-
ciples  merge  with  the  written, codiﬁed  law
varies  across  legal  traditions, but  the  over-
arching  concept  of “fairness” is  a  cross-
cultural  reality. And  in  practice, deﬁnitions
often refer directly to shared values within a
particular community5 as well as to the belief
that people should not suffer before the law
as  a  result  of having  unequal  bargaining
power.6

In  Western  philosophy, Aristotle 

is
regarded  as  the  ﬁrst  author  to  distinguish
between  justice  and  equity.7 He  found  that

Equity and well-being

79

courts enact justice according to law—that is,
by  applying  general  rules  that  give  an  equi-
table solution in the majority of cases. In some
cases, however, the  results  are  inequitable.
Equity then rectiﬁes law in so far as the law is
defective  on  account  of its  generality.8 The
Romans  operationalized  this  concept  of
equity by distinguishing between ius strictum
(strict law) and ius aequum (equity), with the
latter used to interpret the law and to comple-
ment it. Equity prevailed in instances of con-
ﬂict between the two.

In  modern  legal  traditions, equity  re-
mains  a  fundamental  tenet  of legal  theory
and practice. In common law systems, equity
was  historically  a  separate  branch  of law
administered  by  Chancery  Courts.9 The
Judicature Act  of 1873  in  the  United  King-
dom  “fused” the  courts  of law  and  equity,
doing  away  with  a  bifurcated  system  of
courts, while  establishing  the  supremacy  of
equity in cases of conﬂict between equity and
common law. Equitable principles, based on
conscience  and  fairness, have  continued  to
develop and be applied in common law juris-
dictions around the world to mitigate harsh
and unfair results produced by the applica-
tion of formal legal rules in speciﬁc cases.10

In general, the use of equity as a source
of law in the civil law traditions of the Euro-
pean continent is more limited than in the
common  law  tradition. Civil  legal  codes,
which  have  their  origins  in  the  Enlighten-
ment  era, aim  at  integrating  equity  into
formal  law—that  is, by  designing  laws
aimed  at  producing  equitable  results.
Equity is seen as part of law and, therefore,
should be achieved by applying the formal
rules. Provisions  in  the  codes  that  refer
explicitly  to  equity, however, are  used  to
correct  inequitable  results  of the  applica-
tion  of other  formal  provisions, in  a  way
which is similar to common law systems.

Both  the  common  law  and  the  codiﬁed
systems from the continental European tra-
dition have spread to countries around the
globe, and equity is now a global legal con-
cept. The  legal  systems  of Latin  American
countries, such  as  Argentina, Brazil, and
Mexico, have  approaches  to  equity  similar
to  those 
in  continental  Europe, while
Bangladesh, India, and  Nigeria  follow  the
common law tradition. Importantly, equity is

justice,

not  a  purely  Western  concept—it  can  be
found  in  legal  systems  around  the  world,
including  those  that  do  not  share  European
origins.11 For  example,
the  distinction
between  justice  and  equity  is  also  found  in
Islamic law, in which the former is referred to
as adala, the latter as insaf, and in Jewish law,
with the distinction between din and tsedek.12
In  today’s  more  integrated  world, legal
understanding of equity has also inﬂuenced
international  law—serving  as  the  basis  for
individualized 
creating  speciﬁc
principles of fairness and reasonableness, or
being  identiﬁed  with  international  equi-
table  standards  for  sharing  resources  and
redistributing wealth. Perhaps the foremost
example  of the  development  of interna-
tional  principles  of equity  is  the  interna-
tional  human  rights  regime. International
human  rights  law  is  rooted  in  a  commit-
ment  to  protect  the “equal  and  inalienable
rights of all members of the human family,”
which itself is considered to be the “founda-
tion  of freedom, justice  and  peace  in  the
world.”13

The U.N. Charter laid the foundation for
contemporary  international  human  rights
law. The preamble to the Charter states that
the U.N. community “reafﬁrms faith in fun-
damental human rights, in the dignity and
worth  of the  human  person, in  the  equal
rights  of men  and  women  and  of nations
large  and  small.”14 The  Universal  Declara-
tion of Human Rights, adopted by the Gen-
eral  Assembly  of the  United  Nations  on
December 10, 1948, is viewed as the “source
of inspiration and . . . the basis for the U.N.
in  making  advances  in  standard  setting  as
contained  in  the  existing  human  rights
instruments.”15 It has become a highly visi-
ble  and  widely  recognized  statement  of
moral, ethical, and political standards at the
international level.16

The contemporary international human
rights  regime  comprises  a  broad  array  of
legal  instruments,17 many  operating  under
the aegis of the United Nations. There also
exist  regional  human  rights  regimes  in
Europe  (European  Convention  on  Human
Rights  and  Fundamental  Freedoms), the
Americas  (Inter-American  Convention  on
Human Rights), and Africa (African Char-
ter  on  Human  and  Peoples’ Rights). In

80

WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2006

addition, the  laws  of some  other  interna-
tional entities, such as the European Union,
incorporate human rights norms (Treaty of
Nice, Charter of Fundamental Rights of the
European Union). Together, these different
legal  instruments  are  aimed  at  protecting
people against a variety of harms, including
potential  harm  by  their  governments, and
at  committing  to  the  fundamental  princi-
ples of equality and nondiscrimination.

People prefer fairness
Different cultures and religions around the
world may differ in important respects, but
they all share a concern with equity and fair-
ness. This  suggests  something  quite  funda-
mental about the value human beings place
on them. A fairly recent body of literature in
economics sheds some light on these shared
human preferences. It has amassed convinc-
ing evidence on individuals’ preferences for
fairness, based  on  controlled  laboratory
experiments. In these experiments, individ-
uals interact through behavioral games and
play  with  real  money  under  tightly  con-
trolled conditions. Results from such experi-
ments over the last 10 or so years reject the
hypothesis  in  standard  economic  models
that all individuals are exclusively concerned
with  their  material  self-interest. This  new
body  of literature  is  large  and  rich, but  its
main  ﬁndings  can  be  summarized  under
three main points.

First, some  people  behave  in  ways  clearly
inconsistent  with  the  rational  self-interest
hypothesis. According  to  Fehr  and  Fisch-
bacher (2003), such people regularly display
a willingness to engage in two speciﬁc forms
of behavior: “altruistic rewarding, a propen-
sity to reward others for cooperative, norm-
abiding behavior, and altruistic punishment,
a propensity to impose sanctions on others
for norm violations” (785). These behaviors
are observed in contexts in which it is possi-
ble  to  rule  out  individual  motivation  by  a
desire for reciprocity or a concern with rep-
utation. While  reciprocity  and  reputation
are  important  additional  determinants  of
cooperation  in  many  settings, the  experi-
mental evidence suggests that they are not
the  only  factors  that  inﬂuence  cooperative
behavior.

A  classic  example  is  the  Ultimatum
Game, in  which  a  player  (the  Proposer)  is
asked  to  suggest  a  one-time  division  of a
certain sum of money (say, $100) between
himself or  herself and  another  player. The
second  player  (the  Responder)  has  the
power  to  simply  accept  or  reject  the  offer.
Acceptance leads to the implementation of
the  offer, whereas  rejection  leads  to  a  zero
payoff for both players. Monetary stakes are
for keeps, and neither player knows the real
identity of the other player. Both players are
told  that  they  will  never  play  with  each
other again.

In  such  circumstances, standard  game
theory  predicts  a  unique  equilibrium: the
Proposer should offer the smallest possible
amount, and  the  Responder  should  accept
(since a penny is higher than zero). But time
and again, across hundreds of experiments
in  highly  heterogeneous  cultural  circum-
stances and with amounts ranging from one
hour’s  to  one  week’s  local  wages, observed
offers are substantially higher and, even so,
rejections  are  often  observed.18 In  many
experiments, the  modal  (most  frequent)
offer  is  actually  at  50  percent. Figure  4.1
depicts  the  actual  distribution  of observed
offers in two sets of Ultimatum Games, one
with lower monetary stakes (bar on the left)
and one with higher (bar on the right).

Second, people are heterogeneous. A sizable
fraction of people in most experiments (20

to 50 percent) engage in altruistic giving or
altruistic  punishment—expending 
real
resources  in  a  way  that  is  unambiguously
costly to them, without any hope of eliciting
personal gain if the other person is ration-
ally self-interested. But the behavior of oth-
ers  (a  majority)  is  consistent  with  rational
self-interest. This  is  brought  out  quite
starkly  in  the  Dictator  Game, a  variant  of
the Ultimatum Game in which the respon-
der  is  purely  passive. The  second  player  is
simply a Receiver, with no right to reject the
offer. Positive  offers  in  the  Dictator  Game
are  observed, but  they  are  both  rarer  and
smaller on average than under the Ultima-
tum Game, in which the Responder may—
always  at  a  cost—punish  the  Proposer.
These  results  point  to  the  importance  of
investigating more precisely the conditions
under  which  people  exhibit  self-interested
and other-regarding behavior.

If

Third, fair-minded  people  can  behave  self-
ishly, and  self-interested  people  can  behave
fairly. Behaviors depend on the rules of the
game. In games where competitive pressures
are  introduced, mimicking  a  competitive
market, players  tend  to  quickly  converge
toward  actions  consistent  with  self-inter-
ested behavior. An example is an Ultimatum
Game  with  Multiple  Proposers.
the
Responder can choose among various offers
from  different  Proposers, with  all  noncho-
sen  Proposers  receiving  zero, observed
behavior quickly tends to the Nash equilib-
rium. In the Nash equilibrium, all Proposers
offer the full amount—or very close to it—
despite this giving rise to a very unequal dis-
tribution, in which the Responder captures
the entire surplus, and all Proposers get zero.
In  other  settings, however—such  as  the
Repeated  Public  Good  Game  with  Punish-
ment  in  Fehr  and  Gachter  (2000)—even  a
small  number  of altruistic  players  can  sus-
tain a cooperative equilibrium.

These  ﬁndings  have  been  interpreted  to
suggest  that  a  sizable  fraction  of human
beings in most societies care not only about
their own individual opportunities and out-
comes but also about “fairness.” There is also
broad  agreement  that  fairness  consists  of a
concern  for  others, although  some  authors
suggest  that  it  is  other  people’s  intentions

toward  us  that  attract  reward  or  punish-
ment, while others think it is their outcomes
or  opportunities.19 These  studies  do  not
usually  distinguish  explicitly  between  out-
comes or opportunities. But it is possible to
speculate that the aversion to very unequal
payoff distributions in the Ultimatum Game
arises from the arbitrary and unequal nature
of the  endowments  (or  power)  implicit  in
the initial allocation of the roles of Proposer
and Responder.

The experiments also show that people’s
views  of fairness  are  complex  and  do  not
depend entirely on outcomes. Some players
are prepared to punish noncooperators until
they receive less than other people, because
of what they perceive to be the unfairness of
their actions in the process of the game. This
is consistent with our emphasis that observed
distributions  of certain  outcomes—such  as
incomes—are  the  product  of complex  pro-
cesses, and  that  the  primary  interest  for
those concerned with equity is not the out-
come, but the fairness of the processes they
participate 
lifetimes. An
income  distribution  in  which  some  people
are much richer than others because, given
similar  chances, they  have  worked  much
harder, may be regarded as fair. But the same
income  distribution  may  be  regarded  as
unfair if it was generated by the richer group
having access to much better schools or jobs,
solely because of the wealth or connections
of their parents.

in  over  their 

A separate but related point is made by
the  social  identity  literature  in  social  psy-
chology (see Haslam 2001) and epidemiol-
ogy (see Marmot 2004), which suggests that
individual  behavior  and  performance  are
heavily  conditioned  by  group  identity  (for
example, caste, gender, occupation); by
whether  those  groups  are  seen  as  subordi-
nate  to  others  (for  example, doctors  and
patients, the status accorded minority eth-
nic  communities); and  by  whether  the
boundaries  among  groups  are  regarded  as
permeable  (for  example, the  rules  shaping
whether  and  how  employees  get  promo-
tions, immigrants  become  citizens, and  so
on). Civil servants with low status and few
upward  mobility  prospects  suffer  from
higher mortality.20 Employees of low-status

B O X   4 . 2 Capuchin monkeys don’t like inequity either . . .

Research is under way on the roots of
human altruism and the aversion to
inequity, whether cultural or genetic. But
there is some evidence that aversion to
unfairness is not just human. In a recent arti-
cle in Nature, “Monkeys Reject Unequal Pay,”
Brosnan and De Waal (2003) report the
results of exchange experiments with
brown capuchin monkeys (Cebus apella).
The animals were given a token that they
could immediately redeem for food by
returning it to the experimenter.They were
placed in adjoining compartments with
visual and vocal contact.

In the baseline treatment (the equality
test), both specimens received a quarter of
a cucumber slice for each token exchanged.

In one treatment of interest (the

“inequality test”), the ﬁrst monkey received
a grape, while the second was given the
usual slice of cucumber.That capuchin
monkeys prefer grapes to cucumber slices
had apparently been amply established by
previous research.The results were striking.
Monkeys failed to exchange their tokens for
food around 5 percent of the time under

the equality test, but this rate rose to more
than 50 percent under the inequality test.

The refusal rate rose even further (to

more than 80 percent) under an alternative
treatment, known as “effort control.” In this
treatment, the ﬁrst monkey received a
grape with no effort—with no need to pick
up a token and exchange it for food.
Although few monkeys were used, these
differences were all statistically signiﬁcant.

In both treatments, refusal rates

increased over time, as the experiment was
repeated (never more than once a day) many
times. Interestingly, only female monkeys
completed these tests, as earlier experiments
suggested that male capuchins are much
less sensitive to the distribution of rewards.

The authors concluded that “tolerant
species with well-developed food sharing
and cooperation, such as capuchins [. . .]
may hold emotionally charged expectations
about reward distribution and social
exchange that lead them to dislike
inequity” (Brosnan and De Waal 2003, 299).

accept  the  new  organizational  structure
because it beneﬁts them individually, while
members of the higher-status ﬁrm are more
likely to resist change and act collectively in
terms of their premerger identity.21

The  experimental  and  subjective  well-
being  literature  in  economics  and  social
psychology  remind  us  that  there  is  some-
thing deep and fundamental about our taste
for fairness and equity. Such “human altru-
ism,” argue Fehr and Fischbacher (2003) in
Nature, may be what accounts for the much
greater  complexity  of cooperative  patterns
in human societies compared with those of
other  animals  (box  4.2). Equity, it  seems,
matters intrinsically and fundamentally for
human beings.

Whatever  the  exact  form  of the  true
motives  of individuals, the  main  implica-
tion for this report from this large body of
experimental  evidence  is  that  a  good  pro-
portion of people in most societies appear
to dislike unfair outcomes and behaviors, so
much  so  that  they  are  prepared  to  pay  to
punish those responsible for them. If people
are  prepared  to  pay  real  money  to  reduce
inequalities that appear unfair to them in a

laboratory, it is plausible that large inequal-
ities in real life also reduce their well-being
(particularly if the inequalities are not seen
to  reﬂect  only  differences  in  effort  or
merit). This provides support for the statis-
tical  association  that  the  subjective  well-
being

subject we now turn to.

literature  ﬁnds  between 

Income inequality 
and subjective well-being
To what extent do the concerns with equity
shown in tightly controlled lab experiments
also  manifest  themselves  in  the  attitudes,
feelings, and opinions of “regular people?” A
recent  study  of labor  strife  in  the  United
States  suggests  that  worker  perceptions  of
whether  they  have  been  treated  fairly  or
unfairly  can  affect  their  efforts, and  thus
product quality, in important ways (box 4.3).
Other studies investigate the associations
between  the  narrower  concept  of income
inequality and measures of subjective well-
being. One  recent  study  of European
nations and the United States relies on indi-
vidual  answers  to  the  following  question:
“Taken  all  together, how  would  you  say
things  are  these  days—would  you  say  that
you are very happy, pretty happy, or not too
happy?”22 Based on the variation in answers
to this question, across European countries
and  U.S. states, and  on  objective  income-
inequality  measures, Alesina, Di  Tella, and
MacCulloch  (2004)  ﬁnd  that  “individuals
have a lower tendency to report themselves
happy  when  inequality  is  high, even  after
controlling  for  individual  income, a  large
set of personal characteristics, and year and
country [. . .] dummies” (2009).23

One  reason  that  inequality  might  make
people  less  happy, even  when  controlling
for absolute income levels, is that it violates
their  sense  of fairness. It  may  be  that  (at
least some) people feel that a very unequal
income distribution reﬂects unfair processes
and unequal distributions of opportunity. A
2001 study of Latin American countries by
Latinobarometro, a  reputable  Chile-based
opinion survey company, asked respondents
the following question: “Do you think that
the income distribution in your country is
very  fair, fair, unfair, or  very  unfair?” On

B O X   4 . 3 Worker perceptions of unfairness, product quality, and consumer safety

Do people change their behavior because they
feel they are being treated unfairly, when they
are outside laboratories? And if so, is this likely
to have any serious consequence? A study of
industrial relations in Illinois, United States, sug-
gests that the answer to both questions is yes.

Since the 1940s, Firestone tire plants had

adhered to the industrywide bargain with labor
unions. But when negotiations for a new contract
began in 1994, Bridgestone/Firestone proposed
deviating from the industrywide bargain in a way
that worsened the terms for labor at a time when
company proﬁts were increasing.The company
proposed moving from an 8- to a 12-hour shift
that would rotate between days and nights. It
also proposed cutting pay for new hires by 30
percent.The union at the plant in Decatur, Illinois,
called a strike and, shortly after the strike, the
company hired replacement workers.

Labor strife at the Decatur plant closely

coincided with lower product quality and defec-
tive tires. In August 2000, Firestone announced
the recall of 14 million ATX and AT tires, most of
them on the Ford Explorer.The U.S. government
reported that Firestone tires under investigation

were related to 271 deaths and more than 800
injuries.The most common source of failure of
the recalled tires was tread separation, a sudden
detachment of the rubber tread from the steel
belts that caused the tire to blow out.

Krueger and Mas (2004) compare the num-

ber of claims of defective tires in the Decatur
plant with those from the two other North
American plants where Firestone ATX tires were
produced: Joliette, Quebec, and Wilson, North
Carolina. Neither of these two plants
experienced labor strife in the relevant period.
Tires produced during the labor dispute
(1994–96) at Decatur had a much higher failure
rate than those produced at Joliette or Wilson,
although before and after the dispute period
the rate of claims was similar for tires manufac-
tured in Decatur and in the other plants.The
pattern suggests that changes in technology
cannot explain the rise in complaints against
Decatur tires, because no such rise occurred in
Joliette or Wilson.

Nor does it appear that the lack of experience

of replacement workers is to blame.There was a
spike in claims in the ﬁrst half of 1994, around the

time concessions were demanded and the old
contract expired, which occurred before replace-
ment workers were hired.Through early 1995,
when many replacement workers were making
tires, there were no excess claims in the Decatur
plant.It was not until the end of 1995, when many
returning strikers were working side by side with
replacement workers, that the excess number of
claims became high.On the basis of this and a
much broader analysis, it appears likely that the
chemistry between the recalled strikers and the
replacement workers, or the cumulative impact of
labor strife in general, created the conditions that
led to the production of many defective tires.

The authors of the study “recommend that

the reader exercise caution in extending our
results to other settings; our paper provides a
detailed case study of only one ﬁrm in one
unique period of its history” (Krueger and Mas
2004, 257). At least in that instance, it appears
that perceptions of unfair treatment inﬂuenced
worker attitudes—and product quality and the
safety of consumers.

average, 89  percent  of respondents  re-
garded  the  distribution  in  their  countries
to be either unfair or very unfair. In 17 of
the  18  countries  surveyed, fewer  than  20
percent  of respondents  answered  fair  or
very fair.24

Such results may be particularly strong in
Latin  America, which  is  one  of most
unequal  regions  in  the  world, but  they  are
not exclusive to that region. A recent analysis
of several  OECD  countries  (which  are  less
unequal  than  most  developing  countries)
was  based  on  data  from  the  International
Social Survey Program. To construct a proxy
measure  of cross-national  attitudes  toward
income  inequality, Osberg  and  Smeeding
(2004) ask what a number of different pro-
fessions25 “should  earn” and  what  they “do
earn.” They ﬁnd that citizens of most high-
income  countries26 appear  on  average  to
have  similar  attitudes  toward  inequality,
generally thinking that less well-paid profes-
sions should be paid more and that better-
paid professions should be paid less.

Osberg  and  Smeeding  (2004)  ﬁndings
reinforce the view that the normative prefer-
ences  people  have  over  distributions  are

based not exclusively on actual incomes, but
also on processes, and that some differences
in  outcomes  may  be  considered  fair  (for
example, because  of differences  in  effort),
while others are not (for example, because of
differences  in  opportunities). People  are
clearly  aware  that  income  differentials  can
provide incentives for work and investment,
including  in  education, if they  are  coupled
with  opportunities  for  reward  to  those
actions. This comes across very clearly from
the answers to one question in the latest wave
of
the  World  Value  Survey, which  split
respondents around the world more or less
evenly  into  those  who  felt  that  income
inequality was too high and those who felt it
was too low.

ﬁelded  since  the  early  1980s. In  the  latest
wave, Inglehart and others 2004) asked rep-
resentative  samples  of people  in  69  coun-
tries to place their views on a scale from 1 to
10, where  1  implied  agreement  with  the
statement  that  “Incomes  should  be  made
more  equal,” and  10  implied  agreement
with  the  statement  that  “We  need  larger
income  differences  as  incentives  for  indi-
vidual effort.”

Figure 4.2a suggests considerable polar-
ization  on  views  about  inequality. The
median  answer  is  6, suggesting  no  strong
agreement  with  the  two  polar  statements.
Yet  almost  20  percent  of all  respondents
were in strong agreement with each of the
two extreme views, represented by scores of
1 and 10. Figure 4.2b shows a positive corre-
lation  between  the  score  (which  is  nega-
tively  correlated  with  inequality  aversion)
and  a  respondent’s  own  income. This  is
consistent with the evidence on the impor-
tance of relative incomes for welfare: if you
are  richer, you  are  less  inclined  to  favor  a
reduction in income inequalities than if you
are poorer.

The World Values Survey results caution
against  any  preconceived  notion 
that
income inequality is viewed everywhere as
inherently  undesirable. When  asked  about
income differences explicitly “as incentives
for individual effort,” (many) people seem
quite  happy  to  have  them  and, indeed, to

want  more  of them  (although  this  ten-
dency  was  less  pronounced  in  countries
with either very low or very high levels of
inequality).

The balance of the survey evidence sug-
gests  that, although  inequality  in  incomes
seems to be associated with lower aggregate
levels of subjective well-being, there is con-
siderable  heterogeneity  in  opinions  about
whether  it  should  be  reduced  or  not.
Poorer  people, and  people  in  countries  at
very  high  or  very  low  inequality  levels,
seem  likelier  to  favor  a  reduction  in  in-
equality. People  recognize 
that  some
inequality  is  important  to  generate  incen-
tives  for  investment  and  effort; however,
when asked about relative pay scales across
professions, they  would  on  average  prefer
smaller  differentials. While  in  Latin Amer-
ica,
for  instance, a  majority  judges  the
income distribution to be unfair, there is no
worldwide agreement that income dispari-
ties  should  be  reduced  everywhere. This  is
generally  consistent  with  a  view  that  what
matters for ethical judgment is not income,
but fair processes and opportunities.

Income inequality and poverty
reduction
To  the  philosophical  and  legal  arguments
for  equity, and  to  the  survey-based  and
experimental evidence that fairness matters
intrinsically to people, we add a ﬁnal argu-
ment: high levels of inequality make it more
difﬁcult  to  reduce  poverty. First, we  high-
light the fact that if inequality falls during a
growth spell, poverty generally falls by more
than it would have if growth had been dis-
tribution-neutral. Second, we  document
the  ﬁnding  that  the  effectiveness  of future
economic  growth  in  reducing  absolute
income poverty declines with initial income
inequality.

If inequality falls, poverty falls more
during spells of growth
By raising the incomes and consumption of
people  across  the  distribution  of income,
economic  growth  is  the  main  driver  of
poverty reduction in the developing world.
The negative association between the aver-
age  annual  rate  of change  in  poverty  and

the average annual rate of growth in mean
incomes  is  immediately  clear  from  ﬁgure
4.3, suggesting  that  countries  experiencing
higher  rates  of economic  growth  can  be
expected  to  reduce  poverty  much  faster
than  those  that  grow  more  slowly.27 The
slope of the simple regression line, –2.4, is
the  average  total  elasticity  of poverty  with
respect to economic growth. It implies that,
without  controlling  for  any  characteristics
of the country, 1 percentage point growth in
a country’s mean income can be expected to
reduce  the  incidence  of poverty  in  that
country by about 2.4 percentage points.

This powerful association between eco-
nomic  growth  and  poverty  reduction  is
one of the central stylized facts of develop-
ment economics. Its qualitative nature has
long been understood, and it has recently
been  quantiﬁed  by  Ravallion  and  Chen
(1997), Dollar and Kraay (2002), and others.
Indeed, the  growth-poverty  relationship  is
probably more powerful than surprising: it
merely  reﬂects  the  fact  that, on  average,
the  growth  in  the  incomes  of the  poor  is
similar  to  the  growth  of mean  incomes
(figure 4.4). Put differently: aggregate eco-
nomic growth is, on average, distribution-
neutral.28

There is, however, considerable variation
around those averages. About half the total
variation in poverty reduction is accounted
for  by  economic  growth  (see  the  explana-
tory power of the underlying regression for
ﬁgure  4.3).29 The  other  half must  reﬂect
changes  in  the  underlying  distribution  of
relative incomes. This happens because the
incidence of economic growth (its distribu-
tional  pattern)  can  vary  dramatically
across countries. Two countries with simi-
lar  rates  of growth  in  mean  incomes  can
have  very  different  growth  profiles  across
the  population. As  one  would  expect,
reductions  in  inequality  at  a  given  growth
rate  add  a  “redistribution  component” to
the “growth  component,” leading  to  faster
overall poverty reduction.

The  contribution  of inequality  reduc-
tion  alongside  growth  is  illustrated  by  a
comparison of the growth incidence curves
(GIC) for Tunisia (1980–2000) and Senegal
(1994–2001)  (ﬁgure  4.5). In  both  coun-
tries, the average annual growth rate in the

tion, poverty fell by only 15 percent (from
68 percent to 57 percent), corresponding to
an annual rate of poverty reduction of 2.3
percent. Although some of this difference is
due  to  the  fact  that  the  actual  growth  rate
was  marginally  higher  in  Tunisia  (2.7  per-
cent versus 2.3 percent in Senegal), much of
it  is  clearly  due  to  the  different  patterns  in
the incidence of growth, which is evident in
ﬁgure 4.5.

contribution  of

in
inequality to poverty reduction holds more
generally. According to Datt and Ravallion
(1992), a  decomposition  of changes  in
poverty into growth and inequality compo-
nents has been widely applied. Redistribu-
tion  components  are  usually  smaller  than
growth components and, because inequal-
ity often rises, they often have the “wrong”
sign. But  when  inequality  falls, this  helps
reduce poverty.

A second and separate point is that the
power of growth to reduce poverty declines
with  higher  initial  income  inequality. A
reduction  in  inequality  today  therefore
also  tends  to  have  a  future impact  on  the
effectiveness of (even distribution-neutral)
growth  in  reducing  poverty. This  occurs
because the shape of most income distri-
butions  means  that  the  growth  elasticity
of poverty  reduction  tends  to  be  smaller
in  more  unequal  countries. Put  another
way, because  the  initial  distributions  of
income  are  different, the  rate  of poverty

reduction  in  two  countries  with  the  same
distribution-neutral growth rate may well
be different.

Perhaps the most ﬂexible way to capture
the  variation  in  growth  elasticity  with
inequality  across  the  sample  of countries
available  for  these  exercises  is  simply  to
compute  the  total  and  the  partial  growth
elasticity of poverty reduction for each sin-
gle  country  (in  a  single  spell  per  country)
and to plot it against the initial Gini coefﬁ-
cient (ﬁgure 4.6).30 A positive relationship is
apparent for both partial and total elasticity
concepts, for  all  four  poverty  line/poverty
measure combinations.31 The absolute value
of the growth elasticity of poverty reduction
falls  as  countries  become  more  unequal,
both  for  the  total  and  for  the  partial  con-
cepts. The  slope  of the  line  ﬁtted  through
panel  (a)  suggests  that  a  10  percentage
point increase in the Gini coefﬁcient is, on
average, associated with a decline of 1.4 in
the (absolute value) of the elasticity. Given
that the average elasticity is 2.53, this is not
a small effect.

The  fact  that  very  unequal  countries
(with  a  Gini  coefﬁcient  near  0.6)  have  a
total  elasticity  near  zero  in  this  sample
should not be overemphasized. It is caused,
in part, by increases in inequality in some
of
these  countries  during  the  recorded
growth spells. This is evident from the fact
that  the  partial  elasticity  (which  controls
for changes in distribution) does not reach
zero for the same sample. Growth still con-
tributes to poverty reduction, even in high-
inequality  countries. The  robust  ﬁnding
relates to the sign of the slope of the line,
not 
initial
inequality  means  that  growth  reduces
poverty by a lesser amount.

It has been argued that this is a mechan-
ical  result  in  that, given  a  ﬁxed  functional
form  for  the  income  distribution, greater
inequality  results  in  slower  poverty  reduc-
tion even if each individual’s income grows
at the same rate. Indeed, as indicated here,
distributional  change  is  on  average  uncor-
related with mean growth rates so that, on
average, the poor see their incomes grow at
the  same  rate  as  other  people’s. That  does
not, however, follow from any law of nature.

Income  distributions  in  individual  coun-
tries  can  and  do  change  during  spells  of
growth  (see  ﬁgure  4.5).33 There  is  no
mechanical rule that states that the incomes
of the poor must grow at the same rate as
the  rest  of the  population.34 If on  average
they do and if, given the shape of the empir-
ical income distributions, the poverty elas-
ticities  are  lower  in  countries  with  higher
initial inequality, this is an empirical fact.

The  balance  of the  evidence  does  not,
therefore, allow much room for doubt that
growth elasticities of poverty reduction are
stronger in more equal societies. Inequality

the  effectiveness  of

economic
growth  in  reducing  poverty. This  means
that, if all else remains the same, a reduction
in  income  inequality  today  has  a  double
dividend: it is likely to contribute to a con-
temporaneous reduction in poverty, and it
is  likely  to  make  future  growth  reduce
poverty faster.

Evidently, the  caveat “if all  else  remains
the same” is of crucial importance. The dis-
tribution  of incomes  is  a  reﬂection  of the
general  equilibrium  of an  economy, based
on  the  social, political, and  institutional
structures  that  condition 
its  behavior.

WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2006

Simple-minded attempts to change the way
incomes  are  distributed, without  taking
into  account  the  effects  of policies  on  the
incentives of all agents in the economy, are
bound  to  fail. We  return  to  the  issue  of
appropriate policy design in part III of this
report. All that can be said about the results
here is that, if policies exist that can lead to a
less unequal distribution of resources with-
out major costs to the (static and dynamic)
efﬁciency of resource allocation, such poli-

cies  are  likely  to  lead  to  faster  poverty
reduction in the future, for any amount of
growth that the economy generates.

It turns out, however, that some inequali-
ties—not necessarily those of incomes—are
also detrimental to economic growth itself.
Such inequalities in power, assets, and access
to markets and services are most likely to be
the  ones  on  which  policy  can  productively
focus. The next two chapters turn to a dis-
cussion of these “inefﬁcient inequalities.”

5c h a p t e r

Inequality and investment

In  a  world  in  which  markets  worked  per-
fectly, investment decisions would have lit-
tle to do with the income, wealth, or social
status of the decision maker. They would be
determined  by  the  returns  an  investment
promises and by the market price of capital,
adjusted for the extra risk it entails. If peo-
ple  had  good  investment  opportunities, it
really  would  not  matter  whether  they  had
the  money—they  could  always  borrow
what they needed, and if the risk bothered
them, they could always sell shares in their
business  and  buy  safer  assets  with  the
money from the sale.

However,

for  various  reasons—mainly
economic  but  also  political—markets  are
not perfect. If borrowers can willfully default
on their loans, lenders prefer to make loans
to  borrowers  who  can  provide  collateral
assets. Private  returns  for  politically  con-
nected  ﬁrms  can  be  higher  than  for  those
without such connections, and so these ﬁrms
may attract more capital, even though social
returns may not be any greater.1 Members of
groups subject to discrimination may ration-
ally  invest  less  in  their  human  capital  than
they would in the absence of such explicit or
subtle stereotypes.

After  we  give  up  the  idea  that  markets
work anywhere close to perfectly, the scope
for  a  direct  link  between  investment  and
the distribution of wealth or power widens
substantially, in many instances leading to
underinvestment  by  those  who  have  good
growth  opportunities.2 Correcting 
the
market  failures  directly  is  often  not  feasi-
ble, and  in  these  cases  certain  redistribu-
tions  of wealth, power, and  resources  can
serve as second-best alternatives.3 In other
words, interventions to enhance equity can
improve efﬁciency.

One of the great advances in development
economics in the past 15 years is the accre-
tion  of a  substantial  body  of evidence  on
documenting how well (or badly) asset and
ﬁnancial markets work in developing coun-
tries. The fact that these markets rarely meas-
ure  up  to  their  ideal  creates  the  possibility
that wealth and social status, deﬁned as one’s
position in society both in ascriptive identity
and in connections, will have an important
inﬂuence  on  investment  decisions. It  seems
natural to start with this evidence.

Markets, wealth, status,
and investment behavior
The market for credit
In  a  perfect  credit  market, there  is  a  single
interest  rate  and  everyone  can  borrow  or
lend as much as they want at that rate. That
individuals can borrow as much as they want
at the current rate explains the presumption
of a separation between the wealth or status
of the investors and the amount they invest.
Whether  they  are  rich  or  poor, well-con-
nected or just off the streets, an extra dollar
of investment  will  be  proﬁtable  for  them
only  if the  return  they  get  from  it  is  more
than  the  interest  rate. If the  interest  rate  is
higher, they would be better off lending that
money if it was their own, or borrowing less
if it were someone else’s. So, two people with
the same return on investment would end up
investing the same amount.4

How close are real markets to this ideal
market?  Chambhar  is  a  market  town  in
Sindh  (Pakistan), on  the  east  bank  of the
Indus. In  1980–81  farmers  from  the  area
around Chambhar got most of their credit
from  about  60  professional  moneylenders.
Based  on  detailed  data  from  14  of these

89

90

WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2006

lenders  and  60  of
their  clients, Aleem
(1990)  calculated  the  average  borrowing
interest rate charged as 78.5 percent. But if
these farmers wanted to lend their money,
the  banking  system  would  pay  them  only
about  10  percent. It  is  possible, however,
that they may not have been depositing in
the  banks. An  alternative  measure  of the
deposit rate that is relevant for these farm-
ers is the opportunity cost of capital to the
moneylenders, 32.5 percent. In either case,
it  suggests  a  gap  of at  least  45  percentage
points between the borrowing and lending
rates.

The  borrowing  rate  also  varied  enor-
mously across borrowers. The standard devi-
ation  of the  interest  rate  was  38.1  percent,
compared  with  an  average  lending  rate  of
78.5 percent. In other words, an interest rate
of 2 percent and an interest rate of 150 per-
cent are both within two standard deviations
of the mean. One possibility is that these dif-
ferences in interest rates reﬂect differences in
the default rate: perhaps the expected repay-
ment  was  the  same  for  everybody, because
those who paid higher rates were more likely
to  default. Also  the  expected  repayment
could have been equal to the actual interest
rate paid to the depositors, if the default rate
was  high  enough. But  default  was  rare: for
individual  lenders, the  median  default  rate
was between 1.5 percent and 2 percent, with
a maximum of 10 percent.

The same pattern—high and variable bor-
rowing rates, much lower deposit rates, and
low  default  rates—shows  up  in  the  “Sum-
mary Report on Informal Credit Markets in
India.”5 This report summarizes results from
case  studies  commissioned  by  the  Asian
Development  Bank  and  carried  out  under
the National Institute of Public Finance and
Policy.

For the urban sector, the data are based
on various case surveys of speciﬁc classes of
informal  lenders. For  the  broad  class  of
nonbank  ﬁnancial  intermediaries  called
ﬁnance corporations, the maximum deposit
rate for loans of less than one year is 12 per-
cent. These corporations offer advances for
one  year  or  less  at  rates  that  vary  from  48
percent per year to the utterly astronomical
5  percent  per  day. The  rates  on  loans  of
more than one year varied between 24 per-
cent and 48 percent. Default, once again, is
only a small part of the story: default costs
explain only 4 percent of total interest costs.
For  hire-purchase  companies  in  Delhi, the
deposit rate was 14 percent and the lending
rate was at least 28 percent and could be as
high as 41 percent. Default costs were 3 per-
cent of total interest costs.

For  the  rural  sector, interest  rates  are
high, but  they  are  also  variable  (figure
5.1). This  finding  is  based  on  surveys  of
six villages in Kerala and Tamil Nadu, car-
ried  out  by  the  Centre  for  Development
Studies, Trivandrum. The  rich  (with  Rs
100,000 or more in assets) get most of the
credit (nearly 60 percent) and pay a rela-
tively  low  rate  (33  percent), while  those
with  assets  between  Rs  20,000  and  Rs
30,000  pay  rates  of 104  percent  and  get
only  8  percent  of the  credit. The  average
interest rate charged by professional mon-
eylenders  (who  provide  45.6  percent  of
the credit) is about 52 percent.

While  the  average  deposit  rate  is  not
reported, the  maximum  from  all  the  case
studies is 24 percent, and in four of them it is
no more than 14 percent. In the category of
professional  moneylenders, about  half the
loans  were  at  60  percent  or  more, but
another 40 percent or so had rates below 36
percent. Default rates were higher than in the
urban  sector, but  they  still  cannot  explain
more than 23 percent of the interest costs.

Inequality and investment

91

The  fact  that  credit  access  depends  on
social  status  is  also  shown  by  Fafchamps’
(2000)  study  of informal  trade  credit  in
Kenya and Zimbabwe. It reports an average
monthly  interest  rate  of just  over  2.5  per-
cent  (corresponding  to  an  annualized  rate
of 34 percent), but it also notes that the rate
for the dominant trading group (Indians in
Kenya, whites in Zimbabwe) is 2.5 percent a
month, while  the  blacks  pay  5  percent  a
month  in  both  countries.6 Chapter  9  also
provides  evidence  that  in  many  countries
“insiders” effectively lobby to limit access to
ﬁnancial  institutions  and  that  lending  is
skewed toward the rich, consistent with the
evidence in ﬁgure 5.1.

None of these facts is surprising. Contract
enforcement in developing countries is often
difﬁcult, and  it  is  not  easy  to  get  courts  to
punish  recalcitrant  borrowers.7 As  a  result,
lenders often spend at lot to make sure that
their  loans  get  repaid: it  is  plausible  that
these  are  the  resources  that  drive  a  wedge
between the borrowing rate and the lending
rate. Indeed, Aleem  (1990)  shows  that  the
resources  spent  by  lenders  to  monitor  bor-
rowers  explain  the  nearly  50  percentage
point gap between the lending and borrow-
ing rates in his data. It is easy to imagine that
borrowers  who  are  easier  to  monitor  will
enjoy better rates, which would explain why
lending rates vary so much.

These  imperfections  in  credit  markets
have  immediate  implications  for  the  rela-
tionship  between  wealth  and  investment.
First, with  the  rate  of interest  on  deposits
much lower than that on loans, the oppor-
tunity  cost  of capital  for  those  who  just
want  to  invest  their  own  money  is  much
lower  than  the  opportunity  cost  for  those
who  have  to  borrow. This  means  that  the
wealthy  will  end  up  investing  much  more
than the indigent, even if they face exactly
the same returns on their investment. Sec-
ond, the lower interest rates charged to rich
people  reinforce  this  conclusion, because
the rich then face a lower opportunity cost
when  they  too  are  borrowing. Third, in
some cases, those who are unable to provide
collateral will have no access to credit at any
interest rate.

We would thus expect the poor to under-
invest, certainly relative to the rich, but also

relative  to  what  would  happen  if markets
functioned  properly. The  capital  released
because they underinvest is absorbed by the
non-poor, who may actually end up overin-
vesting relative to how they would invest in
perfect markets. This is the reason: because
the poor cannot borrow, the non-poor can-
not lend as much as they would like to (this
is why deposit rates in developing countries
are  often  very  low). And  because  the  non-
poor cannot lend, it makes sense for them to
keep investing in their own ﬁrms, even when
the returns are low.

Because  the  poor  underinvest, and  be-
cause the opportunity cost of capital to the
non-poor is thus lower than it would other-
wise  be, the  composition  of the  investors
also changes. In particular, ﬁrms that would
not  be  viable  if markets  functioned  per-
fectly (for example, because the interest rate
would  be  too  high)  can  survive  and  even
expand  because  markets  are  the  way  they
are. In other words, the “wrong” ﬁrms end
up investing.

The market for insurance
The ideal insurance market is one in which
people bear no avoidable risks. In a setting in
which  a  single  village  constitutes  a  separate
insurance  market  closed  to  the  rest  of the
world (so that only people in the village can
insure  other  people  in  the  village, in  some
kind  of mutual  insurance  arrangement),
individual  consumption  should  respond
only to aggregate (village-level) income ﬂuc-
tuations  and  not  to  ﬂuctuations  in  the
income of speciﬁc individuals. Put in blunter
terms, as  long  as  aggregate  consumption  is
unchanged, individual  income  ﬂuctuations
should  not  translate  into  ﬂuctuations  in
individual  consumption. When  insurance
markets  work  well,
risk  considerations
should not have a signiﬁcant impact on the
choices  people  make, irrespective  of their
wealth, given  that  what  an  individual  does
has little impact on aggregate uncertainty.

While a perfect insurance market is more
complex  than  a  perfect  credit  market, and
thus  harder  to  detect,
there  have  been
attempts  to  test  the  prediction  about  the
irrelevance  of ﬂuctuations  in  one’s  own
income. The Côte d’Ivoire Living Standards
Measurement  Surveys  from  1985  to  1987

92

WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2006

provide panel data on the income and con-
sumption  of nearly  800  households, with
each household tracked for two consecutive
years (1985 and 1986 or 1986 and 1987). In
table  5.1, the  relationship  between  changes
in consumption and changes in incomes is
reported  separately  for  the  three  main
regions  and  separately  for  1985–86  and
1986–87. The ﬁrst row of the ﬁrst block for
each  year  reports  the  basic  correlation
between income and consumption: a fall in
income always hurts consumption, although
the coefﬁcient varies between a low of 0.15
(a $1 reduction in income means that con-
sumption goes down by $0.15) to a high of
0.46. The next row does the same thing, but
now  there  is  a  village  dummy  intended  to
pick  up  any  village-level  changes  in  con-
sumption. Remarkably, the  coefﬁcients  on
own income, which under perfect insurance
should  have  fallen  to  zero  after  controlling
for village-level changes, barely budge.8

Not  all  the  evidence  is  quite  so  pes-
simistic. Townsend  (1994)  used  detailed
household-level  data  from  four  villages,
which were intensively studied by the Inter-
national  Crop  Research  Institute  in  the
Semi-Arid  Tropics  (ICRISAT)  in  India, to
see whether the full insurance hypothesis is
consistent  with  the  data. He  found  that
while  the  data  did  reject  the  exact  predic-
tion, it did not miss by very much. In other
words, his evidence suggested that villagers
do  insure  each  other  to  a  considerable
extent: movements in individual consump-
tion  in  his  data  seem  largely  uncorrelated
with movements in income.

Later  work  by  Townsend, based  on  data
he  collected  in  Thailand, turned  out  to  be
less  encouraging.9 Some  villages  seemed  to

be much more effective than others in pro-
viding 
residents.
Townsend describes in detail how insurance
arrangements differ across villages. While in
one  village  there  is  a  web  of well-function-
ing, risk-sharing  institutions, the  situations
in other villages are different. In one village,
the  institutions  exist  but  are  dysfunctional;
in  another, they  are  nonexistent; in  a  third,
close to the roads, there seems to be no risk-
sharing whatsoever, even within families.10

As  for  credit, the  failure  of insurance
could have something to do with informa-
tional asymmetries. It is not easy to insure
someone  against  a  shock  that  he  alone
observes, because he has every incentive to
always claim that things had gone badly. But
as  Duﬂo  and  Udry  (2004)  demonstrate,
spouses in Côte d’Ivoire do not seem to be
willing  to  insure  each  other  fully  against
rainfall  shocks  that  affect  them  differen-
tially. Because  rainfall  obviously  is  observ-
able, at least part of the problem has to be
elsewhere. One  possibility  is  limited  com-
mitment. People  may  be  happy  to  claim
what was promised to them when it is their
turn to be paid, and then default when the
time  comes  for  them  to  pay. This  may  be
particularly  easy  in  a  setting  in  which  the
social  relations  between  the  sets  of people
who are insuring each other are not partic-
ularly  close, perhaps  explaining  why
Townsend found no insurance in the village
closest to the road.

Lack of insurance should have an effect
on  the  pattern  of investment. That  many
insurable  risks  are  uninsured  means  that
one cannot invest without personally bear-
ing  a  signiﬁcant  part  of the  concomitant
risk. Indeed, big  corporations  able  to  sell

Inequality and investment

93

their  equity  in  organized  equity  markets
may be the only players who can really hope
to diversify away a large part of the risk of a
particular  project. Given  this  fact  and  the
reasonable  assumption  that  the  poor  are
more risk-averse than the rich, we are likely
to  be  in  a  perverse  situation  in  which  the
poor may also ﬁnd it hardest to reduce their
exposure to risk. Thus, they are likely to shy
away from riskier and higher-return invest-
ments, reinforcing  the  prediction  that  the
poor invest too little.

The market for land
In  a  perfect  land  market, individuals  can
buy or lease as much land as they want for
as long as they want at a price that depends
only  on  the  quality  of the  land  (and  the
length of the lease). The lease should be at a
ﬁxed rent, so that the lessor is the residual
claimant on the produce of the land. That
land can be freely bought and sold ensures
that there is no particular advantage or dis-
advantage  to  owning  land  compared  with
any  other  asset  of similar  value. That  the
lessor is a residual claimant means that the
land is put to optimal use. Not so, however,
in practice.

Many developing (and some developed)
countries  have  regulations  about  who  can
buy land and how much or how little they
can buy. Binswanger, Deininger, and Feder
(1995)  argue  that  almost  every  developing
country  today  has  gone  through  a  phase
when  it  had  regulations  intended  to  con-
centrate landownership. By contrast, Besley
and Burgess (2000) provide a list of regula-
tions from different states in India, each of
which is an attempt to limit the concentra-
tion of ownership in land.

Governments  also  directly  limit  trans-
actions in land, with the ostensible aim of
preventing the accumulation of land in the
hands  of a  few  people. In  Ethiopia  in  the
late  1990s, Deininger  and  others  (2003)
note that selling and mortgaging land were
against  the  law. While  rentals  were  offi-
cially  allowed  (after  being  disallowed  for
two  decades),
local  leaders  and  govern-
ments  were  free  to  restrict  even  these
rental  transactions  in  land. For  example,
the Oromia region allowed farmers to rent
only 50 percent of their holding and stipu-

lates  maximum  contract  terms  of 3  years
for traditional technologies and 15 years for
modern technologies.

It  is  often  unclear  who  has  the  right  to
sell a particular plot of land, when no single
person  or  family  has  a  clear, undisputed,
legal title to the land. This ambiguity reﬂects
encroachments and land grabs in the evolu-
tion of land rights, as well as the importance
of custom in governing land relations, espe-
cially  in  Africa. The  recent  popularity  of
land  titling  as  a  social  intervention  is  a
direct consequence.

Where lease contracts exist, they are not
always of the ﬁxed-rent type, at least when
the land is used for cultivation. Many coun-
tries, including  the  United  States, have  a
long tradition of an alternative contractual
form: sharecropping. Under sharecropping,
the farmer gets only a fraction of the pro-
duce, but  he  does  not  need  to  pay  a  ﬁxed
rent. As Alfred  Marshall  pointed  out  more
than  one  hundred  years  ago, this  weakens
incentives  and  reduces  the  productivity  of
the land, but the near universality of share-
cropping suggests that it is a response to a
real  need. There  is  some  disagreement
among  economists  about  the  exact  nature
of that need.11 It is plausible, however, that
the  need  is  related  to  the  fact  that  farmers
are  often  poor, and  making  them  pay  the
full rent when their crop does poorly is dif-
ﬁcult and probably not desirable.

Leaseholds in developing countries tend
to be short-lived. The norm is either a year
or a season. Longer leases are not unknown,
but they are rare. This might reﬂect the fact
that custom, rather than law, secures most of
these leases: perhaps it is too much to rely on
custom to enforce leases of arbitrary length.
The  imperfect  salability  of land  can, of
course, hurt  anyone  who  owns  it. But  the
rural  poor  probably  have  more  of their
wealth in land than most people, so making
land nonsalable might be particularly harsh
on them.

What tends to discourage investment in
the land is the lack of an explicit title, or the
insecurity of tenure more generally (caused,
for example, by the short duration of leases
and the possibility that the landlord might
threaten to take the land away at the end of
the  lease). It  clearly  helps  if land  is  owned

by  the  person  contemplating  the  invest-
ment. That  most  who  work  in  agriculture
tend to be too poor to buy out the land they
are cultivating is thus a potential source of
underinvestment.

The market for human capital
One  thing  makes  the  market  for  human
capital  different  from  all  the  other  asset
markets: many decisions about investing in
human  capital  are  made  by  parents  (or
other family members) for their children. In
other words, those making the decisions are
different from those who receive the human
capital. It  is  not  hard  to  imagine  why  this
separation might introduce important dis-
tortions  to  the  functioning  of this  market.
Gary  Becker’s  classic  formulation  avoids
this  issue  by  assuming  that  the  family  can
borrow  against  the  child’s  future  income,
turning  the  problem  into  a  conventional
investment  decision. Under  that  assump-
tion, the  amount  invested  will  not  depend
on the family’s means.

In  practice, however, although  human
capital  is  an  asset,
it  cannot  be  legally
pledged  or  mortgaged, for  the  simple  rea-
son  that  pledging  your  human  capital
would  be  tantamount  to  selling  yourself
into  slavery.12 This  obviously  constrains
people’s ability to borrow money to ﬁnance
investments in their education.

When  parents  cannot  borrow  against
their children’s future income—true most of
the  time  in  most  developing  countries—
they may still hope that those children will
take care of them in their old age. The hope
might  be  that  the  children  do  grow  up  to
reap the beneﬁts of their parent’s investment
and that they will pay their parents back. But
children know that they have no legal obli-
gation to do so. If they do repay their par-
ents, it is because they love their parents or
because society expects them to do so.

Investments  in  human  capital  may  thus
be driven as much by parents’ sense of what
is the right thing to do, as by any calculation
of costs and beneﬁts. Once we accept this, it
becomes clear that children’s human capital
may  not  be  very  different  from  any  other
consumption  good—so  richer  families  will
tend to invest more in their children’s health
and education. And human capital decisions

may be more a product of culture and tradi-
tion than of the cold calculation of beneﬁts.
Beneﬁts are relevant, but the responsiveness
to  them  may  not  be  as  large  as  one  might
have expected.

In  the  market  for  human  capital, the
reward  should  be  based  entirely  on  the
human capital supplied, not on other attrib-
utes of the person supplying the skills. Dis-
crimination based on gender, caste, religion,
or race obviously violates this, but so does a
system of job allocation based on contacts.
Until very recently, job discrimination based
on gender was the norm all over the world,
and  the  number  of countries  where  such
discrimination 
legally  or
socially  accepted  is  dwindling  but  signiﬁ-
cant. Even  where  such  discrimination  is
explicitly  frowned  on, there  is  some  evi-
dence  of continuing  discrimination. The
same is true of race, caste, and religion. Most
discrimination—unless 
legally  mandated
through afﬁrmative action in favor of a his-
torically  disadvantaged  group, such  as  low
castes in India and African Americans in the
United  States—ﬂies  in  the  face  of explicit
laws against it.

is  still  either 

One reason discrimination is so hard to
eliminate  comes  from  its  sheer  insidious-
ness. Beliefs about differences are embedded
in everyday attitudes and practices in a way
that  neither  the  discriminator  nor  the  dis-
criminated  against  may  be  conscious  of,
even  though  these  beliefs  transform  how
they both behave. This is what underlies the
power  of the  stereotype. In  a  telling  exam-
ple, Stone, Perry, and Darley (1997) asked all
participants in a recent experiment (Ameri-
can  Caucasians, hereafter  referred  to  as
whites)  to  listen  to  the  same  running
account  of an  athlete’s  basketball  perform-
ance on the radio. Half the participants were
led  to  believe  that  the  target  player  was
white, half that  he  was  African  American.
The  results  indicated  that  information  was
less likely to be absorbed if it was discordant
with  the  prevailing  U.S. stereotypes  that
whites are more academically talented than
African Americans, and that African Ameri-
cans are more athletically gifted. The white
target player was perceived as exhibiting less
natural  athletic  ability  but  more  “court
smarts.” The African-American target player

was  perceived  as  exhibiting  fewer  court
smarts but more natural athletic ability.

Such biases have also been documented
in real-world settings. A recent study of the
effect  of stereotyping  on  judgment  ﬁnds
that prison inmates with more Afrocentric
features  receive  harsher  sentences  than
those  with  less  Afrocentric  features, con-
trolling for race and criminal history.13

Bertrand and Mullanaithan (2003) show
evidence  from  a  ﬁeld  experiment  proving
beyond  reasonable  doubt  that  there  is  a
high degree of African-American discrimi-
nation  in  the  United  States. They  sent  the
same resumes to a large number of compa-
nies  under  either  a  stereotypically  white
name  or  a  stereotypical  African-American
name, and found a 50 percent higher call-
back  rate  when  the  name  was  white. The
data say that having a white name is worth
as  much  as  eight  additional  years  of job
experience. Moreover, the  discrimination
tended to be greater when the resume cor-
responded to someone who was better edu-
cated, suggesting that investment in human
capital among African Americans probably
is signiﬁcantly underrewarded.

A very different form of discrimination
comes from the allocation of jobs based on
contacts. Munshi  (2003)  presents  persua-
sive evidence that contacts are very impor-
tant  in  the  allocation  of jobs  for  migrant
labor in the United States. The employment
prospects  for  Mexican  migrants  there, it
turns  out, are  much  better  when  they  are
from areas where there was an earlier out-
ﬂow of migrants. Quite remarkably, it helps
if migrants  are  from  an  area  where  there
was  a  drought  several  years  ago, which
pushed  out  a  cohort  of migrants  to  the
United States. These migrants then help the
later generations of migrants from that area
to ﬁnd jobs. This is the clincher: it does not
help to be from an area where there was a
recent drought.

The  perception  of discrimination, con-
scious  or  not, can  affect  investments  in
human capital. Those who expect to be dis-
criminated  against  in  a  particular  labor
market—rightly or wrongly, consciously or
otherwise—will  tend  to 
in
acquiring the type of human capital that the
market rewards. This could, perversely, gen-

erate self-reinforcing behavior. If members
of the  discriminated  group  invest  less  in
their  own  education, or  in  searching  for
employment, others might use this under-
investment  to  conﬁrm  their  prejudice
against that group.

Stereotypes can be self-fulﬁlling not only
because  they  inﬂuence  perceptions  of the
target  of the  stereotype, but  also  because
they inﬂuence the behavior of the individu-
als  who  are  stereotyped. Stone  and  others
(1999) asked college undergraduate volun-
teers to play a miniature golf course. Perfor-
mance was measured by how many strokes
were  needed  to  put  the  ball  in  the  hole:
fewer  strokes  meant  better  performance.
The variable that the experimenters manip-
ulated  was  the  description  of the  task. In
one  treatment, the  task  was  described  as  a
“standardized  test  of natural  athletic  abil-
ity,” in  the  other  as  a “standardized  test  of
sports  intelligence.” When  the  task  was
described as a test of natural athletic ability,
the  African-American  participants  per-
formed  better  than  the  whites: they  aver-
aged  23.1  strokes  to  complete  the  10-hole
golf course, compared  with  27.8  for  the
whites. But when the task was described as a
test of sports intelligence, the race gap was
reversed: African  Americans  averaged  27.2
strokes, whites 23.3.

One way to interpret this behavior is that
social  ideas—stereotypes  about  the  talents
of different social groups—impose bounds
from within. Under the rational, self-inter-
est  hypothesis,
individuals  change  their
behavior  only  when  their  preferences  or
external constraints change. But the behav-
ior  of real  individuals  depends  as  well  on
belief systems  that  society  impresses  on
them. Negative  stereotypes  create  anxiety
that may interfere with performance: that is
why the psychologist Claude Steele termed
this  kind  of behavior “stereotype  threat.”14
The  beliefs  underlying  the  stereotypes, if
deeply  internalized, can  affect  early  deci-
sions  about  prospective  careers, and  atti-
tudes  toward  society, by  changing  what
Appadurai (2004) calls a person’s “capacity
to aspire.” The reader may recall the exam-
ple (from chapter 2) of the Batwa girl who
wanted  to  be  a  cleaner  upon  completing
school. Positive stereotypes, by contrast, can

96

boost  self-conﬁdence  and  lead  individuals
to expend greater effort.

Stereotypes  inﬂuence  behavior  twice—
through  their  impact  on  individuals’ self-
conﬁdence, and through their impact on the
way  individuals  expect  to  be  treated. To
examine the effect of stereotypes on the abil-
ity  of individuals  to  respond  to  economic
incentives, Hoff and  Pandey  (2004)  under-
took experiments with low- and high-caste
children in rural north India. The caste sys-
tem  in  India  can  be  described  as  a  highly
stratiﬁed social hierarchy in which groups of
individuals are invested with different social
status and social meaning.

In the ﬁrst experiment, groups composed
of
three  low-caste  (“untouchable”)  and
three high-caste junior high school students
were  asked  to  solve  mazes  and  were  paid
based on the number of mazes they solved.
In  one  condition, no  personal  information
about the participants was announced. In a
second condition, caste was announced with
each  participant’s  name  and  village. In  a
third  condition, participants  were  segre-
gated  by  caste  and  then  each  participant’s
name, village, and caste were announced in
the six-person group.

When  caste  was  not  announced, there
was  no  caste  gap  in  performance  (ﬁgure
5.2). But increasing the salience of caste led
to  a  signiﬁcant  decline  in  the  average  per-

formance  of the  low  caste, regardless  of
whether the payment scheme was piece rate
(that is, participants were paid 1 rupee per
maze  solved)  or  tournament  (that  is, the
participant who solved the most mazes was
paid  6  rupees  per  maze  solved, while  the
other participants received nothing). When
caste was announced, the low-caste children
solved 25 percent fewer mazes on average in
the  piece-rate  treatments, compared  with
the performance of subjects when caste was
not announced. When caste was announced
and groups were composed of six children
drawn from only the low caste (a pattern of
segregation that for the low caste implicitly
evokes their traditional outcast status), the
decline in low-caste performance was even
greater. While we cannot be sure from these
data what the children were thinking, some
combination of loss of self-conﬁdence and
expectation  of prejudicial  treatment  likely
explains the result.

The  expectation  by  the  low-caste  sub-
jects  of prejudicial  treatment  may  be
rational  given  the  discrimination  in  their
villages. But  the  discrimination  itself may
not  be  fully  rational. Cognitive  limitations
may  prevent  others  from  judging  stigma-
tized  individuals  fairly. That  people  are
bounded in their ability to process informa-
tion  creates  broad  scope  for  belief sys-
tems—in  which  some  social  groups  are
viewed  as  innately  inferior  to  others—to
inﬂuence economic behavior. If such beliefs
persist, it will generally be rational for those
discriminated  against  to  underinvest  (with
respect  to  others)  in  the  accumulation  of
skills  for  which  the  return  is  likely  to  be
lower for them. This rational calculation is
additional to any reduction in their “capac-
ity  to  aspire,” arising  from  the  internaliza-
tion of those beliefs.

The evidence on
underinvestment
Highly imperfect markets suggest consider-
able scope for underinvestment.

Industry and trade
Direct estimates of marginal products show
that there are many unexploited investment
opportunities. For  small  Mexican  ﬁrms

with  less  than  $200  invested, the  rate  of
return  reaches  15  percent  per  month, well
above the informal interest rates available in
pawn  shops  or  through  microcredit  pro-
grams (on the order of 3 percent a month)
(ﬁgure  5.3).15 Estimated  rates  of return
decline  with  investment, but  the  rates
remain  high—7  percent  to  10  percent  a
month for ﬁrms with investments between
$200 and $500, and 5 percent for ﬁrms with
investments  between  $500  and  $1,000. All
these  ﬁrms  are  thus  too  small  and  could
reap large gains from increased investment.
Trade  credit  is  an  important  form  of
credit everywhere, perhaps especially where
the formal institutions of the credit market
are underdeveloped. Fisman (2001a) looked
at the relation between access to trade credit
and  capacity  utilization  for  545  ﬁrms  in
Côte d’Ivoire, Kenya, Tanzania, Zambia, and
Zimbabwe. He ﬁnds that ﬁrms that receive
trade  credit  from  three  main  suppliers  (on
average, about  one  of the  three  suppliers
provides trade credit) have 10 percent better
capacity  utilization  than  ﬁrms  that  receive
no  trade  credit. The  relation  is  much
stronger in industries in which it is impor-
tant to carry large inventories.

Such  studies  present  serious  method-
ological issues, however. The basic problem
comes  from  the  fact  that  investment  levels
are likely to be correlated with omitted vari-
ables. For example, in a world without credit
constraints,
investment  will  be  positively
correlated  with  the  expected  returns  to
investment, generating  a  positive  “ability
bias.”16 McKenzie  and  Woodruff (2003)
attempt to control for managerial ability by
including the ﬁrm owner’s wage in previous
employment. This goes only part of the way,
however, if individuals choose to enter self-
employment precisely because their expected
productivity  in  self-employment  is  much
higher 
in  an
employed job. Conversely, if capital is allo-
cated  to  ﬁrms  to  avoid  their  failure, there
could be a negative ability bias.

Banerjee and Duﬂo (2004a) take advan-
tage  of a  change  in  the  deﬁnition  of the
“priority  sector” in  India  to  circumvent
these  difﬁculties. All  banks  in  India  are
required to lend at least 40 percent of their
net  credit  to  the  “priority  sector,” which

includes  small  industry. In  January  1998,
the limit on total investment in plants and
machinery for a ﬁrm to be eligible for inclu-
sion  in  the  small  industry  category  was
raised from Rs 6.5 million to Rs 30 million.
The  researchers  ﬁrst  show  that, after  the
reforms, newly  eligible  ﬁrms  (those  with
investment  between  Rs  6.5  million  and  Rs
30  million)  received, on  average,
larger
increments  in  their  working  capital  limit
than smaller ﬁrms. They then show that the
sales  and  proﬁts  increased  faster  for  these
ﬁrms during the same period. Putting these
two facts together, researchers can estimate
the impact of the increased access to work-
ing capital on the growth in proﬁts. Allow-
ing for the possibility that the ﬁrms in the
priority  sector  were  paying  less  than  the
true  cost  of capital  for  the  extra  money
from  the  bank,
they  estimate  that  the
returns to capital in these ﬁrms must be at
least 94 percent.

A different kind of evidence for underin-
vestment  comes  from  the  fact  that  many
people pay the high interest rates reported
earlier. Given that this money typically goes
into ﬁnancing trade and industry, the pre-
sumption  is  that  the  people  borrowing  at
these rates of often 50 percent or more must
have  a  marginal  product  of capital  that  is
even higher. But the average marginal prod-
uct  in  developing  countries  seems  to  be
nowhere near 50 percent. One way to get at
the  average  of the  marginal  products  is  to
look at the incremental capital-output ratio
(ICOR)  for  the  country  as  a  whole.17 For

the  late  1990s  the  International  Monetary
Fund (IMF) estimates the ICOR to be more
than 4.5 for India and 3.7 for Uganda. The
implied upper bound on the average mar-
ginal product is 22 percent for India and 27
percent in Uganda.

That  many  ﬁrms  in  India  have  a  mar-
ginal product of 50 percent or more, while
the average marginal product is only 22 per-
cent or so, is strong prima facie evidence for
the misallocation of capital. The ﬁrms with
the  marginal  product  of 50  percent  and
more are clearly too small, while other ﬁrms
(the ones who bring the average down to 22
percent) must, in some sense, be too large.

A speciﬁc example of this kind of misal-
location  of capital  comes  from  a  study  of
the knitted garment industry in the south-
ern  Indian  town  of Tirupur.18 Two  groups
of people  operate  in  Tirupur: Gounders
and  outsiders. The  Gounders, who  issue
from a small, wealthy, agricultural commu-
nity from the area around Tirupur, moved
into  the  readymade  garment 
industry
because  there  were  not  many  investment
opportunities 
in  agriculture. Outsiders
from  various  regions  and  communities
started joining the city in the 1990s.

The  Gounders, unsurprisingly, have
much stronger ties in the local community,
and thus better access to local ﬁnance. But
they  may  be  expected  to  have  less  natural
ability for garment manufacturing than the
outsiders, who  came  to  Tirupur  precisely
because of its reputation as a center for gar-
ment  export. The  Gounders  own  about

twice  as  much  capital  as  the  outsiders  on
average. Gounder  ﬁrms  of all  ages  own
more capital, although there is a strong ten-
dency toward convergence as the ﬁrms age
(ﬁgure  5.4a). The  Gounders, despite  own-
ing  more  capital, lose  their  early  lead  in
sales by about the ﬁfth year, and end up sell-
ing  less  (ﬁgure  5.4b). In  other  words, out-
siders  invest  less  and  produce  more. They
are clearly more able than the Gounders,19
but  because  they  are  less  cash-rich  and  do
not have the right connections, they end up
working with less capital.

Agriculture
There is also direct evidence of high rates of
returns on productive investment in agricul-
ture. In  the  forest-savannah  in  Southern
Ghana, cocoa cultivation, receding for many
years  because  of the  swollen  shoot  disease,
has been replaced by a cassava-maize inter-
crop. Recently, pineapple  cultivation  for
export to Europe offered a new opportunity
for  farmers  in  this  area. In  1997  and  1998
more than 200 households cultivating 1,070
plots  in  four  clusters  in  this  area  were  sur-
veyed  every  six  weeks  for  about  two  years.
Pineapple  production  dominates  the  tradi-
tional intercrop (ﬁgure 5.5),20 and the aver-
age  returns  associated  with  switching  from
the traditional maize and cassava intercrops
to pineapple is estimated to be in excess of
1,200  percent!  Yet  only  190  out  of 1,070
plots  were  used  for  pineapple. When  the
authors  asked  farmers  why  they  were  not
farming pineapple, the virtually unanimous
response  was, “I  don’t  have  the  money,”21
although  some  heterogeneity 
in  ability
between  those  who  have  switched  to  pine-
apple  and  those  who  have  not, cannot  be
entirely ruled out.

Evidence  from  experimental  farms  sug-
gests  that, in  Africa, the  rate  of returns  to
using chemical fertilizer (for maize) would
also  be  high. But  the  evidence  may  not  be
realistic if the ideal conditions of an experi-
mental  farm  cannot  be  reproduced  on
actual farms. Foster and Rosenzweig (1995)
show,
for  example, that  the  returns  to
switching  to  high-yielding  varieties  were
actually low in the early years of the green
revolution  in  India, and  the  returns  were
even negative for farmers without an educa-

tion. This, despite  the  fact  that  these  vari-
eties had been selected precisely for having
high yields, in proper conditions. But they
required complementary inputs in the cor-
rect quantities and timing. If farmers were
not  able  or  did  not  know  how  to  supply
them, the rates of returns were actually low.
Chemical fertilizer, however, is not a new
technology, and the proper way to use it is
well  understood. To  estimate  the  rates  of
returns  to  using  fertilizer  on  farms  in
Kenya, Duﬂo, Kremer,
and  Robinson
(2004), in  collaboration  with  a  small  non-
governmental  organization  (NGO), set  up
small randomized trials on people’s farms.
Each farmer in the trial delimited two small
plots. On one randomly selected plot, a ﬁeld
ofﬁcer  from  the  NGO  helped  the  farmer
apply fertilizer. Other than that, the farmers
continued  to  farm  as  usual. The  rates  of
return from using a small amount of fertil-
izer varied from 169 percent to 500 percent,
depending  on  the  year, although  marginal
returns  declined  quickly  with  the  quantity
of fertilizer used on a plot of a given size.

Evidence for a different type of underin-
vestment in agriculture is the negative size-
productivity  relationship, the  idea  that  the
smallest farms tend to be the most produc-
tive (table 5.2). The gap in the productivity
of small  and  large  farms  within  a  country
can  be  enormous: a  factor  of 5.6  in  Brazil
and  a  factor  of 2.75  in  Pakistan.22 It  is
smaller in Malaysia (1.5), but a large farm in
Malaysia  is  not  very  large. This  is  strong
prima facie evidence that markets are some-
how not allocating the right amount of land
to  those  who  currently  farm  the  smaller
plots.

The problem with this kind of evidence is
that it ignores the many reasons why the big-
ger farm may be inherently less productive,
for example, lower soil quality. Even so, sim-
ilar  (but  somewhat  less  dramatic)  results
show  up  even  after  controlling  for  differ-
ences in land quality. The proﬁt-wealth ratio
in Indian ICRISAT villages is the highest for
the smallest farms, and when risk is compar-
atively low, the gap is more than 3:1 (ﬁgure
5.6). Because  wealth  includes  the  value  of
the  land, the  measure  implicitly  takes  into
account  differences  in  the  quality  of the
land. It does so as long as land prices are a

Monsoon onset, standard deviation (weeks)

measure of underlying risk. The onset date of the monsoon was the

reasonable  measure  of land  quality, which,
however, is not entirely clear. There are also
residual  doubts  about  whether  the  returns
are  well  measured—it  is  possible  that  the
land of the smaller farms is degrading faster,
but  the  degradation  is  not  being  counted
while calculating the returns.

For these same ﬁrms, when risk goes up,
the  average  return  goes  down. In  part  this
may be inevitable, but it may also reﬂect the
fact  that  the  lack  of insurance  encourages
people  to  avoid  risky  (but  remunerative)
choices.23 This is consistent with the fact that
proﬁtability falls faster for the poorer farm-
ers (less able to self-insure) as the risk goes
up. Speciﬁcally, a one-standard-deviation in-
crease in the coefﬁcient of variation of rain-
fall  leads  to  a  35  percent  reduction  in  the
proﬁt  of poor  farmers, a  15  percent  reduc-
tion in the proﬁt of median farmers, and no
reduction in the proﬁt of rich farmers. The
study  also  ﬁnds  that  input  choices  are
affected by variability in rainfall, and in par-

100

WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2006

ticular, poor farmers make less efﬁcient input
choices in a risky environment.

In related work, Morduch (1993) speciﬁ-
cally investigated how the anticipation of a
credit  constraint  affects  the  decision  to
invest in high-yielding variety seeds. Using
a  methodology  inspired  by  Zeldes  (1989),
he splits the sample into two groups—one
group  of landholders  expected  to  have  the
ability  to  smooth  their  consumption, and
one group that owns little land, expected to
be constrained. He ﬁnds that the more con-
strained  group  devotes  a  considerably
smaller  fraction  of land  to  high-yielding
variety seeds for rice and castor.

Another  consequence  of

the  lack  of
insurance is that it may lead households to
use  productive  assets  as  buffer  stocks  and
consumption  smoothing  devices, which
would be a cause for inefﬁcient investment.
Rosenzweig  and  Wolpin  (1993)  argue  that
bullocks  (an  essential  productive  asset  in
agriculture)  serve  this  purpose  in  rural
India. They show, using ICRISAT data cov-
ering  three  villages  in  semiarid  areas  in
India, that bullocks, which constitute a large
part  of households’ liquid  wealth  (50  per-
cent  for  the  poorest  farmers), are  bought
and  sold  quite  frequently  (86  percent  of
households had either bought or sold a bul-
lock  in  the  previous  year). Moreover, they
buy  when  they  are  ﬂush  with  money  and
sell when they are broke.

Since people are not simultaneously sell-
ing  and  buying  land, they  are  not  selling
these animals because they no longer need
them for production. Indeed, from the view
point of production, most of these farmers
should  own  two  bullocks  and  never  sell
them. If they are selling, the reason is that
they need the money for consumption. The
data suggest that, for poor or midsize farm-
ers, there  is  considerable  underinvestment
in bullocks, presumably because of the bor-
rowing constraints and the inability to bor-
row  and  accumulate  ﬁnancial  assets  to
smooth  consumption: almost  half
the
households in any given year hold no bul-
locks  (most  of
the  others  own  exactly
two).24

There  is  also  compelling  evidence  that
sharecroppers  lack  incentives. Binswanger

and Rosenzweig (1986) and Shaban (1987)
both  show  that  productivity  is  30  percent
lower in sharecropped plots, controlling for
farmers’ ﬁxed effects (that is, comparing the
productivity of owner-cultivated and farmed
land  for  farmers  who  cultivate  both  their
own land and that of others) and for land
characteristics. Shaban  (1987)  shows  that
all  the  inputs  are  lower  on  sharecropped
land,
investments
(fertilizer and seeds). He also ﬁnds system-
atic  differences  in  land  quality  (owner-
cultivated  land  has  a  higher  price  per
hectare), which  could  in  part  reﬂect  long-
term investment.

including  short-term 

On  the  impact  of security  of property,
Do and Iyer (2003) ﬁnd that a land reform
that gave farmers the right to sell, transfer, or
inherit  their  land-use  rights  also  increased
agricultural 
investment, particularly  the
planting of multiyear crops (such as coffee).
Laffont and Matoussi (1995) use data from
Tunisia to show that a shift from sharecrop-
ping  to  owner  cultivation  raised  output  by
33  percent, and  moving  from  a  short-term
tenancy  contract  to  a  longer-term  contract
increased output by 27.5 percent.25

Security  of property  rights  is  often
linked  to  the  local  power  structure. The
connection  between  inequalities  in  power
and  underinvestment  is  nicely  exempliﬁed
by the Goldstein and Udry (2002) study of
investment in land in a setting where land is
allocated  by  custom  (rural  Ghana). They
show that individuals are less likely to leave
their  land  fallow  (an  investment  in  long-
run productivity of the land) if they do not
hold a position of power within either the
hierarchy of the village or the hierarchy of
the  lineage. The  problem  is  that  the  land
gets taken away from them when it is lying
fallow. Because  women  rarely  hold  these
positions, women’s  land  is  not  left  fallow
enough  and  is  much  less  productive  than
men’s.

Human capital
According to the report of the Commission
on  Macroeconomics  and  Health  (2001),
returns  to  investing  in  health  are  on  the
order  of 500  percent. But  these  numbers,
arrived  at  through  cross-country  growth

regressions, are  not  as  easy  to  interpret  as
what  would  actually  happen  if someone
were to invest an extra dollar in health. That
said, there  clearly  are  examples  of speciﬁc
health  interventions  that  have  enormous
private and social returns. There is substan-
tial experimental evidence that supplemen-
tation in iron and vitamin A increases pro-
ductivity at relatively low cost.

• Basta, Soekirman, and Scrimshaw (1979)
study iron supplementation among rub-
ber  tree  tappers  in  Indonesia. Baseline
health  measures  indicated  that  45  per-
cent of the study population was anemic.
The intervention combined an iron sup-
plement and an incentive (given to both
treatment  and  control  groups)  to  take
the  pill  on  time. Work  productivity
among  those  who  got  the  treatment
increased by 20 percent (or $132 a year),
at a cost per worker-year of $0.50. Even
taking into account the cost of the incen-
tive  ($11  a  year), the  intervention  sug-
gests extremely high rates of returns.

• Thomas and others (2005) obtain lower
but still high estimates in a larger experi-
ment, also in Indonesia. They found that
iron  supplementation  experiments  in
Indonesia reduced anemia, increased the
probability of participating in the labor
market, and  increased  earnings  of self-
employed  workers. They  estimate  that,
for  self-employed  males, the  beneﬁts  of
iron supplementation amount to $40 per
year, at a cost of $6 per year.26

• The cost-beneﬁt analysis of a deworming
program27 in Kenya reports estimates of
a  similar  order  of magnitude. Taking
into account externalities (because of the
contagious  nature  of worms), the  pro-
gram  led  to  an  average  increase  in
schooling of 0.14 years. Using a reason-
able  ﬁgure  for  the  returns  to  a  year  of
education, this additional schooling will
lead to a beneﬁt of $30 over the life of the
child, at a cost of $0.49 per child per year.
Not all interventions have the same rates
of return, however. A  study  of Chinese
cotton mill workers28 led to a signiﬁcant
increase in ﬁtness, but no corresponding
increase in productivity.

Inequality and investment

101

Measured returns to private investment in
education  tend  not  to  be  quite  so  high.
Banerjee  and  Duﬂo  (2004b)  survey  cross-
country evidence, and conclude that— 

Using the preferred data, the Mincerian rates
of returns seem to vary little across countries:
the mean rate of returns is 8.96, with a stan-
dard  deviation  of 2.2. The  maximum  rate  of
returns  to  education  (Pakistan)  is  15.4  per-
cent, and the minimum is 2.7 percent (Italy).29

But  most  of the  educational  beneﬁts  of
deworming  mentioned  above  would  be
captured  by  a  child  whose  parents  are
willing to spend $0.50 on the deworming
medicine. This  clearly  offers  a  return
much higher than the measured Mincer-
ian  returns  at  affordable  absolute  cost,
although  they  are  not  strictly  compara-
ble. Deworming  does  not  require  the
child to spend more years in school, but
it does help the child get more out of the
years  he  or  she  is  already  spending  in
school. However, when  the  deworming
medicine  was  offered  free  to  the  chil-
dren, the take-up was only 57 percent. In
this  sense, it  is  clear  that  at  least  some
causes  of underinvestment  have  to  be
found in the way the family makes deci-
sions,

The fact that a lack of connections alters
the  nature  of human  capital  investment  is
nicely  demonstrated  in  a  recent  paper  by
Munshi  and  Rosenzweig  (forthcoming).
They  show  that, in  India, trade  liberaliza-
tion increased returns to knowing the Eng-
lish  language  in  families  with  connections
in  the  blue-collar  sector  compared  with
families  with  no  connections. However,
there is a much bigger gap between girls and
boys in the increase in enrollment in Eng-
lish-medium  schools. This  is  attributed  to
the  fact  that  girls  never  really  expected  to
get  these  blue-collar  jobs, while  for  their
brothers, it depended on whether they had
the right contacts.

Inequalities and investment
Four  important  points  follow  from  this
body of evidence: ﬁrst, markets in develop-
ing  countries  are  highly  imperfect, and

102

WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2006

those  who  do  not  have  enough  wealth  or
social  status  tend  to  underinvest. The
resources underused because of this under-
investment end up being used for some less
productive  purpose, reducing  overall  pro-
ductivity. In the example from the knitted
garment industry in Tirupur, the Gounders
were  overinvesting  in  their  own  relatively
unproductive  ﬁrms, while  the  much  more
productive  ﬁrms  of
the  outsiders  were
starved  of capital. The  land  owned  by
Ghanaian  women  was  getting  degraded,
because they did not have the social status
needed  to  hold  on  to  the  land  during  the
fallowing period. This, once again, is a pure
loss for society. The fact that other people
who  do  have  status  and  can  fallow  their
land as needed is not, in any way, compen-
sating  for  the  loss  of productivity  on  the
lands of the powerless. This creates a strong
presumption  that  certain  speciﬁc  types  of
redistribution, by empowering certain peo-
ple  or  increasing  their  access  to  resources
or  contacts, can  promote  efﬁciency  and
equity.

Second, this hypothesis would imply a bias
in favor of those kinds of redistribution that
target the speciﬁc lack of access to resources or
inﬂuence causing the inefﬁciency. In some sit-
uations  this  will  mean  redistributing  assets,
but it also might mean redistributing access to
capital, perhaps  by  promoting  microcredit,
strengthening  women’s  land  rights  or  access
to  jobs  and  welfare  programs, designing
afﬁrmative  action  programs  to  break  down
stereotyping, and improving access to justice
systems.

Third, because investments build wealth
and  wealth  makes  it  easier  to  invest  in  a
world where markets do not function very
well, a little help can go a long way. Starting
the right business might be the biggest chal-
lenge: once started, the business might pro-
pel itself forward without any further help.
Fourth, it is not clear that the beneﬁciar-
ies  from  this  kind  of efﬁciency-promoting
redistribution have to be the poorest of the
poor. Because the ideal is to promote pro-
ductive  investments, the  target  should  be
those  most  likely  to  make  these  invest-
ments. Whether  the  poorest  are  the  right
people from this point of view is an empiri-
cal question, and one for which the answer

might  depend  on  the  set  of economic
opportunities available.

The microcredit community, in particu-
lar, has long debated this last issue in trying
to decide whether microcredit is best instru-
ment  for  helping  the  poorest  of the  poor.
This  clearly  turns  partly  on  whether  the
poorest are the ones who have the projects
with the highest returns, which could be the
case if the poor and the less poor have the
same kinds of production functions, and if
there  are  diminishing  returns  to  scale. If,
instead, the  most  productive  technology  in
this area had a ﬁxed cost of production but
(say) diminishing returns otherwise, giving
the poorest access to more capital may not
be very productive: even with all the capital
they can get, they may not be able to cover
the  ﬁxed  cost. It  may  be  more  effective  to
help people who are slightly richer, because
with some help they may actually be able to
start a business.

How  good  or  bad  is  the  assumption  of
decreasing  returns  in  the  production  func-
tion  of an  individual  ﬁrm?  As  mentioned
above, McKenzie and Woodruff (2003) esti-
mate a production function for small Mexi-
can  ﬁrms, suggesting  strong  diminishing
returns. Mesnard and Ravallion (2004) ﬁnd
weak  diminishing  returns  using  Tunisian
data. But estimating a production function
that  exhibits  local  increasing  returns  is
inherently difﬁcult. A ﬁrm is likely to grow
(or shrink) quickly when it is in the region
of increasing returns. So we will observe few
ﬁrms  in  this  region, and  be  likely  to  reject
too often the assumption of local increasing
returns. Certainly the natural interpretation
of the results in Banerjee and Duﬂo (2004a),
showing  close  to  100  percent  returns  in
medium  ﬁrms  in  India, is  that  there  are
increasing returns over some range.

A corollary of this discussion is that the
redistribution  that  maximizes  productivity
growth  is  not  necessarily  the  one  that  has
the  strongest  immediate  effect  on  poverty.
Nor is it the one that does most to reduce
inequality. Indeed, except  under  very  spe-
cial  circumstances, this  discussion  tells  us
nothing  about  the  relation  between  some
global  measure  of inequality  and  the  efﬁ-
ciency of resource use or investment. Con-
sider the case, discussed above, in which the

Inequality and investment

103

production  function  has  a  ﬁxed  cost  but
also  diminishing  returns. If all  ﬁrms  are
equal  and  the  maximum  they  can  each
invest is less than the ﬁxed cost, no one will
be able to start a ﬁrm. Increasing inequality
will  raise  the  productivity  of capital  by
making it possible for some ﬁrms to pay the
ﬁxed cost. Because there are also diminish-
ing returns, however, there will be a point at
which  any  further 
in  overall
inequality would be counterproductive.

increase 

More  generally, the  effect  of inequality
will depend on the shape of the production
function, and  the  size  of the  investment
potential  of the  average  person  relative  to
the ﬁxed cost. Obviously, the issue gets even
more complicated if different ﬁrms have dif-
ferent production functions and if produc-
tivity  is  correlated  with  the  owner’s  wealth
(as it might be if the owner’s education is an
important input into production and richer
people tend to be more educated).

Several  authors  have  tried  to  look  for  a
systematic  relation  in  cross-country  data
between inequality and growth (presumably
what  investment  is  meant  to  achieve). A
lengthy body of literature30 estimated a long-
run equation, with growth between 1990 and
1960, for  example, regressed  on  income  in
1960, a set of control variables, and inequal-
ity  in  1960. Estimating  these  equations
tended  to  generate  negative  coefﬁcients  for
inequality. But  there  are  obvious  concerns
about  whether  such  a  relation  could  be
driven  entirely  by  omitted  variables. To
address  this  problem, Li  and  Zou  (1998),
Forbes  (2000), and  others  used  the  time
series dimension of the Deininger and Squire
data  set  to  look  (effectively)  at  the  effect  of
short-run changes in inequality on changes
in  growth.31 The  results  change  rather  dra-
matically: the coefﬁcient of inequality in this
speciﬁcation is positive and signiﬁcant.

A  recent  review  paper  by  Voitchovsky
(2004)  concludes  that  both  these  effects  are
quite  robust. Most  studies  that  look  at  the
cross-sectional relationship between inequal-
ity  and  subsequent  growth  over  a  relatively
long period in cross-country data, and espe-
cially  those  that  use  measures  of asset
inequality, ﬁnd a negative relationship, often
signiﬁcant.32 By  contrast, most  studies  that
look  at  the  relationship  between  changes  in

inequality and changes in growth, including
several studies that do the analysis at the sub-
national level within the same country, ﬁnd a
positive effect.

Both  Banerjee  and  Duﬂo  (2003)  and
Voitchovsky (2004) conclude that there is no
reason to give one of these sets of results pri-
ority  over  the  other. Indeed, both  could  be
right. For example, in the short run, policies
that  allow  large  cuts  in  real  wages  might
encourage  investment, but  in  the  long  run,
the  consequent  increase  in  poverty  might
make it harder for the population to maintain
its human capital. Or both could be wrong.
Most important among the many reasons for
both  the  cross-sectional  and  the  time  series
evidence to be misleading are the following:
the  possibility  of a  nonlinear  relationship
between  inequality  and  growth, problems
with  comparability  of cross-country  data,
and  the  difﬁcult  question  of identifying  the
direction of causality when both variables are
likely to inﬂuence one another.

This lack of clear-cut results is perhaps dis-
appointing, but it is worth emphasizing that
our  focus  here  has  been  on  redressing  spe-
ciﬁc  inequalities in productive opportunities
rather than some overall measure of inequal-
ity. Despite the great attention devoted to the
question of a systematic relationship between
overall inequality and growth at the country
level, the  body  of evidence  remains  uncon-
vincing. But  there  clearly  are  situations  in
which  there  is  a  strong  presumption  that
reducing a speciﬁc inequality would promote
better investment.

One  such  example  comes  from  Opera-
tion Barga, a tenancy reform in the Indian
state  of West  Bengal  in  the  late  1970s  and
1980s. It has been known, at least since the
work  of
the  great  Victorian  economist
Alfred  Marshall, that  sharecropping  pro-
vides  poor 
incentives  and  discourages
effort. In  such  an  environment, a  govern-
ment intervention that forces the landlords
to give their sharecroppers a higher share of
the  output  than  the  market  would  give
them should increase effort and productiv-
ity. This  is  exactly  what  happened  in West
Bengal, India, when  a  Left  Front  govern-
ment came to power in 1977. The tenant’s
share of output was set at a minimum of 75
percent  as  long  as  the  tenant  provided  all

104

WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2006

inputs. In addition, the tenant was guaran-
teed  a  large  measure  of security  of tenure,
which may have encouraged him or her to
undertake  more  long-term  investments  on
the land. Survey evidence shows a substan-
tial  increase  in  both  the  security  of tenure
and the share of output going to the share-
cropper. The  fact  that  the  implementation
of this reform was bureaucratically driven,
and proceeded at different speeds in differ-
ent  areas, suggests  the  possibility  of using
variation  in  the  implementation  of
the
reform to evaluate its impact. The evidence
suggests that there was a 62 percent increase
in the productivity of the land.33

A  different  program, also  promoting
equity and efﬁciency, had to do with redress-
ing  the  effects  of intrafamily  inequality. A
long line of research claims that income and
expenditures  are  often  controlled  by  the
male  members  of the  family  and  that  this
leads  to  underinvestment, especially  in  the
health and education of girls. One fallout of
dismantling  the  apartheid  regime  in  South
Africa  was  the  expansion  of
the  South
African social pension program to the black
population. Pension  entitlements  would
accrue  to  elderly  males  and  females, and
many older women living alone were entitled
to receive the beneﬁt. In many cases, children
of very  poor  parents  were  sent  to  live  with
grandparents  who  began  to  receive  these
pensions. Duﬂo (2003) compared the impact
of these  new  transfers  on  the  nutrition  of
children living with their grandparents, sepa-
rately  for  households  in  which  the  pension
was given to the grandmother and those in
which it was assigned to a grandfather.

For children born before the expansion,
in 1990 and 1991, height-for-age was slightly
lower in families in which the grandmother
would eventually get the pension. For chil-
dren born after the expansion, in 1992 and
1993, the  children  are  signiﬁcantly  taller
(except for the newborns) in those families.
There  is  no  difference  between  noneligible
families  and  families  in  which  pension

money  goes  to  the  grandfather. (Boys  are
essentially  unaffected.)  The  estimates  sug-
gest that receipt of the pension (which was
about  twice  the  per  capita  income  among
blacks) was enough to help girls bridge half
the  gap  in  height-for-age  between  South
African and American children.

These examples show that it is possible to
enhance both equity and efﬁciency simulta-
neously. Judicious redistribution—of income
to  grandmothers, of power  to  poor  women
farmers, of credit  to  entrepreneurs  in  small
ﬁrms—can 
increase  the  productivity  of
resources, such  as  land, human  capital, and
physical capital. If markets fail, resources do
not always ﬂow to where their return is great-
est, particularly if that happens to be in proj-
ects  run  by  people  with  limited  wealth  or
inﬂuence. Careful microeconomic case study
evidence, some of which was summarized in
this  chapter, suggests  that  certain  forms  of
redistribution  can  reduce  waste  and  con-
tribute to a better use of resources, while also
reducing inequality of opportunity. In fact, it
enhances  efﬁciency  precisely  because 
it
reduces inequality of opportunity.

This is not to say that one cannot easily
imagine certain types of redistribution that
hurt efﬁciency. But given the near universal-
ity of market failures and underinvestment
in poor countries, it should be possible, with
a combination of good research and careful
thinking, to identify opportunities for redi-
recting resources to poorer people who are
in a position to make good use of them.

In  making  the  case  for  improvements
in  equity  that  are  also  efficiency-enhanc-
ing,
this  chapter  used  mainly  micro-
economic  evidence  on  markets, wealth,
and agency of individuals. The next chap-
ter uses a different set of historical, macro-
economic, and  institutional  evidence  to
argue  that  complex  historical  processes,
combined with inequalities in inﬂuence and
power, may  lead  to  bad  political  and  eco-
nomic  institutions, which  severely  impair
the development of poor countries.

Spain

Equity and development in the Spanish transition to democracy
In the last half century, Spain has gone from authoritarianism and underdevelopment to democracy and wealth. Spain’s
history illustrates how the distribution of political agency and economic assets greatly inﬂuences the policy choices avail-
able to a society. The fundamentals of economic and political structure inﬂuence and constrain the choices. But the
process is not deterministic: political agency and policies can shift the underlying fundamentals (as happened in Spain in
the 1960s and 1970s) and open the space for new choices.

Before the civil war:
social and economic polarization
Until the second half of the twentieth cen-
tury, Spanish  contemporary  history  was  a
tale of political and economic failure. After
a period of territorial expansion and Euro-
pean  hegemony  in  the  early  modern  ages,
Spain  lapsed  into  economic  decline  and
cultural  stagnation  in  the  following  cen-
turies. During most of the nineteenth cen-
tury, its  industrial  takeoff was  blocked  by
political instability, inefﬁcient legal institu-
tions, substantial inequalities, and a poorly
educated  population. In  1929, per  capita
income  was  $3,000  (in  1990  dollars)—
two-ﬁfths that of Britain and less than two-
thirds that of France.

Spain was polarized by entrenched social
and economic inequalities. In a country still
eminently agrarian, the distribution of land
was  very  unequal. About  1  percent  of the
holdings  occupied  50  percent  of the  land.
Educational  attainment  remained 
low,
strictly  linked  to  circumstances  of birth.
Social  mobility  was  almost  nonexistent.
Except for Catalonia and the Basque coun-
try, which  industrialized  in  the  nineteenth
century, Spain lacked a large middle class.

Against this backdrop of relative stagna-
tion and high inequality, democratic insti-
tutions were introduced in 1931—only the
second  time  in  Spanish  history. They  did
not last long. The brief democratic period
(1931–36) was characterized by huge politi-
cal instability and social agitation. The ﬁrst
Republican government pushed ahead with
a  strong  reformist  program: separation  of
church  and  state; a  single  system  of state
schools  and  a  goal  to  universalize  educa-
tion; a  process  of land  reform; a  law  to
decentralize  political  power  to  Catalonia;
and stepped up efforts to reform the army.
These reforms elicited a strong reaction
from  the  right, which  came  to  power  in
1933 and quickly moved to halt them. Two
and a half years later, in the spring of 1936,

new elections were held, with a victory for
the left. The threat of more radical policies
prompted a military uprising, supported by
the landed classes, much of the bourgeoisie,
and the church. Spain became engulfed in a
three-year civil war. The social polarization
locked Spain into a zero-sum gain over the
distribution  of wealth. There  was  little
political space for compromise or reformist
solutions. The “haves” opposed all attempts
at even minimalist reform. The “have-nots”
wanted radical change, not gradual reform.

The Franco regime:
from autarky to growth
With  the  defeat  of the  Republican  govern-
ment by the Nationalist army in 1939, Gen-
eralissimo  Francisco  Franco  established  an
authoritarian  regime  that  lasted  until  his
death in 1975. The destruction caused by the
civil war depressed the Spanish economy. Per
capita  income  fell  to  its  1900  level  and  did
not reach its 1918 level until 1950. The pro-
portion of the active population in industry
declined to 22 percent in 1940 (the level in
1920) and the share of employed in agricul-
ture rose above 50 percent. Growth averaged
only 1.2 percent a year in the 1940s.

foreign 

Spain’s  economic  recovery  was  ham-
pered, above all, by the autarkic and statist
policies  of the  Franco  regime. Inspired  by
the corporatist ideologies of Italian Fascism
and German Nazism, Franco’s regime gen-
eralized  a  system  of price  controls  and
rationing  and  regulated 
trade
through  quantitative  controls. This  inter-
ventionist  strategy  extended  to  the  labor
and  housing  market. To  quell  one  of the
main forces that opposed the military insur-
rection, Franco  outlawed  any  independent
labor unions. Instead, workers and employ-
ers had to afﬁliate in a national trade union
organization. This  repressive  stance  was
“compensated” by  strict  labor  legislation
that made it hard for employers to dismiss
workers or to hire them through temporary

contracts. Emphasis on permanent jobs and
cheap  housing  was  seen  as  a  substitute  for
the lack of direct social policies, an attempt
by the regime to win legitimacy.

In  the 

late  1950s, Spain  eventually
moved  to  break  with  this  interventionist
system. An acute political crisis—associated
with  a  wave  of strikes, an  economic  re-
cession, and  severe  balance-of-payment
crisis—led the government to adopt a stabi-
lization plan in March 1959. In addition to
ﬁscal  and  monetary  restraint,
the  plan
included wide-ranging measures to liberal-
ize the economy. It was an outright success.
From  1960  to  the  outbreak  of the  ﬁrst  oil
crisis, output expanded at an average annual
rate of more than 7 percent with very little
interyear  volatility. Per  capita 
income
almost  tripled  from  about  $3,000  (in  1990
dollars)  to  $8,500  in  15  years. Productivity
growth averaged 6 percent.

The transformation of the Spanish econ-
omy led to signiﬁcant structural changes in
Spanish  society. The  combination  of eco-
nomic  growth,
industrial  expansion  and
internal  migration  produced  a  substantial
decline 
interregional
inequality (from a standard deviation in per
capita  income  of 0.37  in  1955  to  0.27  in
1973).
inequality  also
declined  considerably: the  Gini  coefﬁcient
for wages and salaries of employees (agrar-
ian  and  industrial)  declined  from  0.29  in
1964 to 0.23 in 1973; the Gini coefﬁcient for
household income fell from 0.39 in 1964 to
0.36 in 1974. The income share of the three
central deciles went up from about 51 per-
cent to 59 percent in that decade.

Interhousehold 

Still, signiﬁcant  social  and  economic
inequities remained. Although the illiteracy
rate had fallen to 10 percent by 1970, only 6
percent  of the  population  had  completed
secondary studies. Wages remained damp-
ened by repressive labor institutions. Taxa-
tion  and  public  spending  were  low, and
redistributive social programs nonexistent.

Transitioning to democracy 
and building the welfare state
Following  Franco’s  death  in  1975, King
Juan  Carlos  became  the  Spanish  head  of
state. He immediately launched a process of
political change. Employing the legal mech-
anisms put in place by the very technocratic
generation that had reformed the economy
in  the  early  1960s, as  well  as  pointing  to
wide  popular  support  for  democracy, he
secured  the  consent  of the  old  Francoist
Cortes to  establish  a  truly  democratic  par-
liament elected through direct, competitive
elections.

The  political  reform  was  ratiﬁed  with
overwhelming  popular  support  in  a  ref-
erendum  in  December  1976. Although
conducted in a climate of uncertainty, par-
ticularly over the reaction of the army and
the  extent  to  which  terrorist  violence  or
labor mobilization could disrupt the negoti-
ations, democratic  elections  were  held  in
June  1977. After  protracted  negotiations, a
new constitution was approved in 1978 with
the support of all parliamentary groups. To
reinforce  the  political  pact  in  parliament,
the  government  also  struck  a  wide  eco-
nomic  and  social  deal  with  employers  and
trade unions that same year.

Spain’s  democratization  was  rooted  in
the new economic and social conditions of

the  1960s  and  1970s. Rapid  industrializa-
tion  and  urbanization  deﬂated  past  con-
ﬂicts  around  the  distribution  of land. The
expansion  of literacy  and  the  increase  in
productivity and incomes generated a large
middle  class. Sustained  growth  defused
social conﬂict with the credible promise of
higher  incomes  and  more  social  mobility.
In short, Spain had overcome the zero-sum
game it had been locked in for the past cen-
tury and a half.

Economic growth resulted in a different
economic  structure  and  better  distribu-
tional  outcomes, supporting  a  swift  and
successful transition to democracy. In turn,
the  transition  to  democracy  changed  the
role and size of the public sector.

Democratization  reinforced  social  de-
mands  for  progressive  and  redistributive
policies—especially for public infrastruc-
ture, and  education, health, and  social
programs. In  1979  more  than  70  percent
of Spaniards  agreed  with  the  statement
that  “the  distribution  of wealth  in  this
country  is  totally  unjust.” In  10  years,
social  expenditure  almost  doubled  to
reach 80 percent of the European average.
Public  expenditure  in  education  steadily
increased from 2 percent of GDP in 1975
to 4.5 percent in 1995. By 2001 almost 50
percent of the population had completed

secondary  education—10 
times  more
than in the mid-1970s. An ambitious pub-
lic  investment  program  tripled  the  public
highway network, revamped and expanded
metropolitan transportation, and modern-
ized the railroad system.

Spain’s transition to democracy and the
resulting  expansion  of
its  welfare  state
shows how a mutually reinforcing package
of policy  and  institutional  choices  leading
to  greater  equity  helped  underpin  the
development  and  modernization  of
the
Spanish  economy  and  its  integration  into
the  European  Union. It  illustrates  how
political and economic structures shape the
possibilities  for  policy  choice, a  theme  of
chapter 6. But it also illustrates that speciﬁc
policy  choices  matter—across  social  sec-
tors, infrastructure, the  workings  of mar-
kets, and  international  integration—and
that there can be important complementar-
ities  for  both  equity  and  dynamic  growth,
notably between greater social provisioning
and greater reliance on markets. This takes
us to the issue of practical policy design, the
central theme of part III of this report.

Equity, institutions,
and the development process

Product, land, labor, and capital markets are
crucial  for  the  allocation  of resources  and
development. Market  institutions, however,
exist and function in the context of a whole
set  of nonmarket  and  political  institutions.
The nature of these other institutions—and
the  way  they  function—are  inﬂuenced  by
inequalities in the political and social realm.
The most obvious of these other institu-
tions are those that deﬁne and enforce prop-
erty  rights  and  contracts. People  will  not
invest if property rights are not well deﬁned
and enforced, or if they believe that the con-
tracts they write will not be honored or that
courts of law will not be fair. The state must
also provide a whole set of other inputs apart
from  social  order  and  fair  contract  enforce-
ment. These include various types of public
services  and  regulations. Lying  behind  well-
functioning markets are legal systems, judges,
policemen, and, ultimately, social groups and
politicians.

This chapter considers the circumstances
and  processes  for  creating  institutions  that
promote prosperity. These circumstances are
closely related to the concerns of this report.
In essence, societies that create institutions to
generate sustained prosperity are equitable in
important ways. Because talent and ideas are
widely distributed in the population, it is cru-
cial that the property of all people is secure
and  that  there  is  equality  before  the  law  for
all, not just for some. Predetermined circum-
stances should not constrain anyone’s inno-
vation  or  investment  opportunities. This
implies that a good institutional environment
will not block entry into new lines of business
and  that  the  political  system  will  provide
access  to  services  and  public  goods  for  all.
Institutions must be equitable.

To  take  an  extreme  example, institutions
were  severely  inequitable  in  slave  societies,

such as Haiti or Barbados in the eighteenth
century. Even though property rights in land
and people were well deﬁned and even well
enforced (although subject to potential slave
rebellions), most  people  had  no  property
rights and were thus subject to expropriation
by  others, particularly  their  masters. For  95
percent of society, there were no incentives to
engage in socially desirable activities. A simi-
lar, although somewhat less extreme, example
of inequitable  institutions  is  South  Africa
under apartheid. Institutions there were good
for the whites but left 80 percent of the popu-
lation without incentives or opportunities to
engage in economically productive activities.

The distribution of power 
and institutional quality:
circles vicious and virtuous 
How  do  societies  develop  equitable  non-
market  institutions?  First, there  must  be
sufﬁcient  political  equality—equality  in
access to the political system and in the dis-
tribution of political power, political rights,
and inﬂuence.

Poor  institutions  will  emerge  and  persist
in  societies  when  power  is  concentrated  in
the hands of a narrow group or an elite. Such
an elite may grant property rights to itself, but
the  property  rights  of most  citizens  will  be
unstable. There  may  be  equality  before  the
law for a particular elite group, but not for the
majority of people. Government policies may
favor such an elite, granting them rents and
monopolies, but  most  people  will  be
excluded  from  entering  proﬁtable  lines  of
business. The  education  system  may  invest
heavily in the children of such elites, but most
will be excluded.

Many things determine the distribution of
political power in society—the constitution,

107

108

WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2006

the  nature  of checks  and  balances, and  the
ability of different groups to solve collective
action  problems. But  economic  inequality
often underpins political inequality. In a soci-
ety  with  large  inequalities  of assets  and
incomes, the  rich  will  tend  to  have  more
inﬂuence and an advantage in adapting and
distorting institutions to their beneﬁt.

Because  the  distribution  of power,
through its impact on institutions, helps to
determine  the  distribution  of income, the
possibility of vicious and virtuous circles is
clear. A society with greater equality of con-
trol  over  assets  and  incomes  will  tend  to
have  a  more  equal  distribution  of political
power. It will therefore tend to have institu-
tions  that  generate  equality  of opportunity
for the broad mass of citizens. This will tend
to  spread  rewards  and  incomes  widely,
thereby reinforcing the initial distribution of
incomes. In contrast, a society with greater
inequality of assets and incomes will tend to
have a less egalitarian distribution of power
and worse institutions, which tend to repro-
duce the initial conditions.

The evidence in this chapter suggests that
the ﬁrst type of society will tend to be more
prosperous. We argue that societies prosper-

Average protection against risk of

expropriation, 1985–95

Sources:Political Risk Services, International Country Risk Guide (ICRG) and World Bank database.
Note: The ﬁgure shows the relationship between GDP per capita in 1995 and a measure of the security of property
rights, “protection against expropriation risk,” averaged over the period 1985 to 1995. The data on institutions come
from Political Risk Services, a private company that assesses the risk that investments will be expropriated in different
countries. These data, ﬁrst used by Knack and Keefer (1995) and subsequently by Hall and Jones (1999) and Acemoglu,
Johnson, and Robinson (2001, 2002a, 2004), are imperfect as a measure of the relevant institutions because they pertain
to investments by foreigners only. Even so, they seem in practice to capture how stable property rights are in general.
The ﬁndings are robust to using other available measures of related institutions.

ous today are so because they have developed
more  egalitarian  distributions  of political
power, while poor societies often suffer from
unbalanced  distributions. We  also  consider
how some societies made the transition from
one equilibrium to the other.

Because  institutions  have  distributional
effects, conﬂict  arises  naturally. One  set  of
institutions  will  beneﬁt  some  people, while
another  will  beneﬁt  different  people. Thus,
there will be incentives for people to control
power to create or keep the institutions that
beneﬁt  them  and  to  avoid  or  weaken  the
institutions  that  disadvantage  them. If the
groups in conﬂict are deﬁned along ascriptive
lines, such as ethnicity, then this may induce a
more  severe  form  of conﬂict  than  when
groups are deﬁned along other lines, or when
there are cross-cutting cleavages. More polar-
ized  conﬂict  seems  to  be  an  independent
force leading to bad institutions that can help
to explain the relatively weak performance in
some societies (discussed below in a compar-
ison between Guyana and Mauritius).

Political equality also matters for the qual-
ity of public policy. The basic role of the state
is  to  provide  public  services. But  politicians
have the correct incentives to provide public
services only when they have to appeal to the
broad  mass  of citizens  to  attain  power. If
they can win power with a small number of
key  supporters, or  with  few  votes, they  will
tend to be clientelistic and more inclined to
buy  votes  or  make  individual  exchanges  of
patronage for support without providing the
goods and services critical to raising the mass
of people out of poverty.

Some simple patterns in the cross-country
data show that more egalitarian distributions
of political power and income are associated
with sustained and enduring prosperity. Fig-
ure 6.1 indicated that more secure property
rights  are  associated  with  higher  incomes.
Crucially, however, better  institutions  and
secure  property  rights  are  associated  with
greater political equality.

Although  there  is  no  perfect  way  of
measuring  political  equality, protection
against  expropriation  risk  is  highly  corre-
lated  with  measures  of democracy  and
measures  of “constraints  on  the  executive”
from  the  Polity  IV  database. This  second
variable is designed to capture the extent to

which those who control political power are
constrained or checked by others. The types
of checks  and  balances  and  separation  of
powers  written  into  the  U.S. Constitution
are  classic  examples  of such  constraints.
There is a negative correlation between con-
straints on the executive and the Gini coefﬁ-
cient of income distribution.

The simple correlations suggest comple-
mentarities  between  a  relatively  egalitarian
distribution of political power, good institu-
tions, and prosperity, and a relatively egali-
tarian  distribution  of economic  resources.
The  correlations  are  consistent  with  many
different  causal  stories, but  recent  research
suggests  that  one  can  tell  a  causal  story
about this data along exactly the lines we are
suggesting, which  the  rest  of this  chapter
discusses. The different evolutions of bank-
ing systems in Mexico and the United States
in  the  nineteenth  century  provide  a  good
example of the sort of historic argument we
rely on (box 6.1).

Institutions and political
inequality matter for
development: historical evidence
Figure 6.1 showed the relationship between
security  of property  and  prosperity  for  the
whole world, but to interpret this causally we
need to ﬁnd a source of variation in institu-
tions. Doing this is not easy, but Acemoglu,
Johnson, and  Robinson  (2001)  provide  a
partial  answer. They  show  that  the  same
basic  pattern  holds  for  a  smaller  sample  of
countries—those  colonized  by  Europeans
after 1492. Indeed, colonization of much of
the world by Europeans provides something
of a large natural experiment.

Beginning  in  the  early  ﬁfteenth  century
and  massively  intensifying  after  1492, Euro-
peans conquered many other nations. Colo-
nization  transformed  the  institutions  in
many diverse lands conquered or controlled
by  Europeans. Most  important, Europeans
created  very  different  sets  of institutions  in
different  parts  of their  global  empire, as
exempliﬁed  most  sharply  by  the  contrast
between  the  institutions  in  the  northeast  of
America and those in the plantation societies
of the  Caribbean. This  experience  persua-
sively  establishes  the  central  role  of institu-

B O X   6 . 1 Banking in the nineteenth century,

Mexico and the United States

Much recent work on growth and develop-
ment has focused on ﬁnancial and capital
markets. A central issue is to understand
why ﬁnancial systems differ. For example,
studies of the development of banking in
the United States in the nineteenth century
demonstrate a rapid expansion of ﬁnancial
intermediation, which most scholars see as
a crucial facilitator of the economy’s rapid
growth and industrialization. Haber (2001)
investigated the development of banks in
the nineteenth century in Mexico and the
United States. He shows that “Mexico had a
series of segmented monopolies that were
awarded to a group of insiders” (24). In 1910
“the United States had roughly 25,000
banks and a highly competitive market
structure; Mexico had 42 banks, two of
which controlled 60 percent of total bank-
ing assets, and virtually none of which actu-
ally competed with another bank.”

Why this huge difference? The relevant
technology was certainly widely available,
and it is difﬁcult to see why the various
types of moral hazard or adverse selection
connected with ﬁnancial intermediation
should have limited the expansion of banks
in Mexico but not the United States. Indeed,
Haber shows when the U.S. Constitution
was put into effect in 1789, the structure of
U.S. banking looked remarkably like that
arising later in Mexico. State governments,
stripped of revenues by the Constitution,
started banks as a way to generate tax rev-
enues and restricted entry to generate
rents.Yet this system did not last because
states began competing among themselves
for investment and migrants. As Haber
(2001) puts it,

The pressure to hold population and business in
the state was reinforced by a second, related, fac-
tor: the broadening of the suffrage. By the 1840s,

had done so.The broadening of the suffrage, how-
ever, served to undermine the political coalitions
that supported restrictions on the number of bank
charters.That is, it created a second source of polit-
ical competition—competition within states over
who would hold ofﬁce and the policies they would
enact (10).

The situation was very different in Mex-
ico. After 50 years of endemic political insta-
bility, the country became uniﬁed under the
highly centralized 40-year dictatorship of
Porﬁrio Díaz until the revolution in 1910.

In Haber’s argument, political

institutions in the United States allocated
political power to people who wanted
access to credit and loans. As a result, they
forced state governments to allow free
competitive entry into banking. In Mexico,
political institutions were very different.
There were no competing federal states,
and suffrage was highly restrictive. As a
result, the central government granted
monopoly rights to banks, which restricted
credit to maximize proﬁts.The granting of
monopolies turned out to be a rational way
for the government to raise revenue and
redistribute rents to political supporters
(North 1981).

Haber (2001) documents that market

regulation was not aimed at solving market
failures, and it is precisely during this period
that the huge economic gap between the
United States and Mexico opened (on
which see Coatsworth 1993, Engerman and
Sokoloff 1997). Haber and Maurer 2004
examined in detail how the structure of
banking inﬂuenced the Mexican textile
industry between 1880 and 1913.They
show that only ﬁrms with personal contacts
with banks were able to get loans and that
such ﬁrms were less efﬁcient. Even though
economic efﬁciency was hurt by
regulations, those with political power were
able to sustain them.

tions  in  development. It  also  provides  fairly
clear-cut evidence to support our conjectures
about  the  joint  evolution  of prosperity  and
political and economic equality.

Colonial origins of contemporary
institutions
Acemoglu, Johnson, and  Robinson, building
on  the  research  of Engerman  and  Sokoloff
(1997), explain  that  Europeans  created  good
institutions in some colonies, particularly the
United States, Canada, and Australasia (what

110

WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2006

Crosby (1986) calls the neo-Europes), and bad
ones in others (particularly in Latin America
and  Sub-Saharan  Africa). These  institutions
had  a  strong  tendency  to  persist  and  thus,
today, generate the results seen in ﬁgure 6.1.

Why  did  different  institutions  develop  in
different  European  colonies?  The  simplest
answer  is  that  Europeans  shaped  the  institu-
tions in various colonies to beneﬁt themselves.
And because conditions and endowments dif-
fered  among  colonies, Europeans  con-
sciously created different institutions. There
are several important empirical regularities
connecting initial conditions to current out-
comes. Of particular importance are initial
the  disease  environ-

ment, and the factor endowments that inﬂu-
enced  economic  organization.1 There  is  a
strong inverse relationship between popula-
tion density in 1500 and current protection
against expropriation risk for former Euro-
pean colonies (ﬁgure 6.2). And colonies with
disease  environments  that  were  worse  for
European  settlers  also  have  worse  institu-
tions today (ﬁgure 6.3).

Other  aspects  of factor  endowments  are
more difﬁcult to measure directly, but Enger-
man  and  Sokoloff (1997)  point  out  that
where the climate and soils were suitable for
crops  such  as  sugarcane—which  could  be
grown on large plantations with slave labor,
such  as  northeastern  Brazil—much  worse
institutions and more skewed distributions of
political  power  evolved  than  in  climates
where  wheat  or  other  nonplantation  crops
could be grown.

Why  did  Europeans  introduce  better
institutions  in  previously  relatively  unset-
tled  and  healthy  areas  than  in  previously
densely  settled  and  unhealthy  areas?  How
did  factor  endowments  inﬂuence  institu-
tions? Europeans were more likely to intro-
duce  or  maintain  bad  institutions  where
there  were  a  lot  of resources  and  rents  to
extract—gold, silver, and, most  important,
people to provide the labor. In places with a
large  indigenous  population, Europeans
could exploit the population through taxes,
tributes, or employment as forced labor in
mines or plantations. And where plantation
crops  could  be  proﬁtably  grown, slave-
based  societies  emerged. These  types  of
colonization  were  incompatible  with  insti-
tutions providing economic or civil rights or
equality  of opportunity  to  the  majority  of
the  population. So, a  more  developed  civi-
lization with a denser population structure,
and particular climatic and agricultural con-
ditions, made  it  more  proﬁtable  for  the
Europeans to introduce bad institutions.

In contrast, in places with little to extract,
where  plantation  agriculture  was  not  prof-
itable, and  in  sparsely  settled  places  where
the  Europeans  became  the  majority  of the
population, it was in their interests to intro-
duce  much  better  institutions. In  addition,
the disease environments differed markedly
among  the  colonies, with  obvious  conse-
quences  for  the  attractiveness  of European

settlement. When  Europeans  settled, they
established  institutions  under  which  they
themselves had to live.

This  research  suggests  that  most  of the
gap in per capita income between rich and
poor countries today is due to differences in
institutions. More precisely, if one takes two
typical  countries—in  the  sense  that  they
both  lie  on  the  regression  line—with  high
and low expropriation risk, such as Nigeria
and  Chile, almost  the  entire  difference  in
income  per  capita  between  them  can  be
explained by the differences in the histori-
cally  shaped  measure  of the  security  of
property  rights.2 The  research  also  pre-
sented  regression  evidence  showing  that
once the effect of institutions on GDP per
capita is properly controlled for, geographic
variables—such as latitude, whether or not
a country is landlocked, the current disease
environment—have  no  explanatory  power
for current prosperity.

Different  types  of societies  thus  devel-
oped  in  different  colonies  with  radically
different implications for subsequent devel-
opment. Crucially, the societies that emerged
in the neo-Europes had distributions of eco-
nomic  resources  and  political  power  that
were  much  broader. And  they  placed  con-
straints  on  the  exercise  of political  power
and  the  ability  of elites  to  adopt  policies
favorable to themselves but deleterious for
society (ﬁgure 6.4).

Development and inequality 
in the Americas: A case study 
in colonial origins
The  colonization  of Latin  America  began
with the discovery of the “Indies” by Colum-
bus in 1492, the assault on Mexico by Cortés
after 1519, and the conquest of Peru by Piz-
zaro  after  1532. From  the  beginning, the
Spanish were interested in the extraction of
gold  and  silver, and  later  in  taking  tribute
and raising taxes. The colonial societies that
emerged  were  authoritarian, based  on  the
political power of a small Spanish elite who
created a set of institutions to extract wealth
from the indigenous population.

After Pizzaro conquered Peru, he imposed
institutions  to  extract  rents  from  the  newly
conquered  Indians. The  main  such  institu-
tions were the encomienda (which gave Span-

Source:Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson (2002a). The analysis indicates that that the same factors that gave rise to
good institutions gave rise to a more egalitarian distribution of power. Without some measure of voice, it is impossible
for a person’s property rights to be guaranteed or for them to have real access to the legal system to make sure that
contracts are honored. A more egalitarian distribution of political power is also associated with a more egalitarian dis-
tribution of economic resources. To get a better understanding of the mechanisms, we need to look further into histori-
cal analysis.

ish  conquistadors  the  right  to  Amerindian
labor),3 the  mita (a  system  of forced  labor
used in the mines), and the repartimiento (the
forced  sale  of goods  to  Indians, typically  at
highly  inﬂated  prices). Pizzaro  created  480
encomenderos, under  whose  care  the  entire
Indian  population  was  placed. In  other
colonies  the  situation  was  similar. For
instance, in the territory of modern Colom-
bia, there were about 900 encomenderos.4

labor 

The encomienda did not last for long in
all parts of the empire because the Spanish
Crown attempted to curtail it by the end of
the  sixteenth  century. But  the  mita (from
the  Quechua  word  mit’a, meaning “turn”)
became  a  central  institution  until  inde-
pendence, and  forced 
lasted  far
beyond this in most of Latin America (until
1945  in  Guatemala). The  effects  of
the
encomienda also persisted because the con-
centration  of political  power  that  it  was
associated  with  led  to  the  emergence  of
large  landed  estates.5 The  feasibility  and
attraction of this type of economic system
was  determined  by  the  higher  population
densities  of
indigenous  people  in  many
parts of the Spanish empire and the extent
to  which  such  societies  had  already  devel-
oped into “complex societies.”6

Other institutions were designed to rein-
force  this  system. For  instance, indigenous

112

WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2006

people  were  not  allowed  to  give  testimony
in some cases, and in others the testimony
of 10 indigenous people was equal to that of
1  Spaniard.7 Although  indigenous  people
did use the legal system to challenge aspects
of colonial  rule, they  could  not  alter  the
main parameters of the system. In addition,
the Spanish Crown created a complex web
of mercantilistic  policies  and  monopolies
from  salt  to  gunpowder, from  tobacco  to
alcohol and playing cards, to raise revenues
for the state.

Spanish colonies that had small popula-
tions  of Amerindians, such  as  Costa  Rica,
Argentina, or  Uruguay, seem  to  have  fol-
lowed different paths of institutional devel-
opment. The  sharp  contrasts  along  many
institutional  dimensions  between  Costa
Rica  and  Guatemala  (where  population
density was greater) have been much stud-
ied. Although  the  formal  political  institu-
tions of the Spanish empire were the same

functioned
depended on the local conditions.8

the  way 

they 

The  institutions  that  emerged  in  the
main Spanish colonies greatly beneﬁted the
Spanish crown and the Spanish settler elite,
but  they  did  not  promote  prosperity  in
Latin America. Most of the population had
no  property  rights, nor  incentives  to  enter
socially  desirable  occupations  or  to  invest.
Europeans  developed  coercive  regimes
monopolizing military and political power
and  respecting  few  constraints  on  their
power  (unless  imposed  by  the  mother
country in Europe).9

In North America, the initial attempts at
colonization  were  also  based  on  economic
motives. British  colonies  were  founded  by
such  entities  as  the  Virginia  Company  and
the Providence Island Company with the aim
of proﬁts. The  model  was  not  so  different
from that of the Spanish or Portuguese (a sys-
tem  that  other  British  colonizing  entities,
such as the East India Company, used to great
effect). Yet these companies made no money.
Indeed, both the Virginia Company and the
Providence Island Company went bankrupt.
Because of the absence of a large indigenous
population and complex societies, a colonial
model  involving  the  exploitation  of indige-
nous  labor  and  tribute  systems  was  simply
not feasible in these places.

Historical accounts show that initial con-
ditions had a large impact on the institutions
that the settlers built. Because there was low
population  density  and  no  way  to  extract
resources  from  indigenous  peoples, early
commercial  developments  had  to  import
British  labor. And, relative  to  much  of the
colonial world, the disease environment was
benign, stimulating  settlement. Indeed, the
Pilgrim  fathers  decided  to  migrate  to  the
United States rather than Guyana because of
the  high  mortality  rates  in  Guyana.10 But
these same conditions made it impossible to
proﬁtably  exploit  labor, whose  bargaining
power forced elites to extend political rights
and create equal access to land and the law.
These forces were reinforced by the fact that
plantation  agriculture  and  slavery  were  not
proﬁtable, at  least  in  the  northern  United
States and Canada.

These  colonies  ultimately  provided  ac-
cess to land to a broad cross-section of soci-
ety  and  the  legal  system  became  fairly
impartial, ensuring  secure  property  rights
for  smallholders  and  potential  investors.
The new institutions made investment pos-
sible  through  ﬁnancial  development  and
secure  contracting  and  business  relation-
ships. Underpinning these institutions were
fairly  representative  political  institutions
and  a  fairly  egalitarian  distribution  of
resources. As in Latin America, there was a
synergy  between  economic  and  political
institutions, but  this  time  it  was  virtuous,
not vicious. Institutions giving and protect-
ing  property  rights  for  the  mass  of people
and  institutions  of democratic  politics
complemented  each  other, ensuring  an
environment  conducive  to  investment  and
economic progress.

Representative  political  institutions  in
Virginia were a direct result of the authori-
ties  realizing  that, because  of the  different
conditions, the  colonization  strategy  that
worked  in  Peru  would  not  work  in  the
United States. Virginia had many competing
and  fragmented  tribes, not  a  large  central
tribal  empire. It  had  no  gold  or  silver, and
the  Indians, not  used  to  paying  tribute  or
engaging  in  forced  labor, would  not  work.
So, the  settlers  of Jamestown  starved.11 In
response to these early failures, the Virginia
Company  tried  various  incentive  schemes,

B O X   6 . 2 Growth with poor institutions does not last

The elite had good investment opportunities in
Argentina in the golden age from the 1870s to
the 1920s, in Czarist Russia in the decades lead-
ing up to World War I, in Colombia in the half
century after 1900, and in the Côte d’Ivoire for
the ﬁrst two decades after independence (Wid-
ner 1993). Such situations are rarely sustainable,
for three reasons. First, the possibilities for sus-
tained growth are, by deﬁnition, limited because
institutions exclude the majority of the popula-
tion from effectively investing. Second, in the
rare situations in which elites manage to create
arrangements so that they can beneﬁt directly
from growth without the need to create good
institutions more generally, such arrangements
tend to be fragile, vulnerable to shocks or crises.
Third, bad institutions create power struggles
that undermine growth, because they generate
large rents for those who control power.

Consider the growth of Argentina in the half

century before 1930. After its independence
from Spain in 1816, Argentina plunged into 50
years of civil wars and conﬂicts over control of
the country, mainly clashes between those in
control of Buenos Aires and the littoral and
those in the interior.These conﬂicts abated after
the 1853 constitution and the presidency of Bar-
tolomé Mitre with a compromise between the
Pampas and the interior. Pampean mercantile
and agrarian interests would be allowed to cre-

ate institutions to take advantage of the huge
economic opportunities emerging on world
markets, but the structure of the political rules,
such as their overrepresentation in national
political institutions, guaranteed the interior
provinces a large slice of the beneﬁts (Samuels
and Snyder 2001).

Although the majority was excluded from

the political system, the economy boomed with
the property rights of the Pampean elite guar-
anteed. But the huge rents created by this sys-
tem began to cause conﬂict. In the 1890s, the
Radical Party emerged under Hipólito Yrigoyen,
and after a series of revolts it was incorporated
into the political system by the democratizing
impact of the Sáenz Peña Law in 1912.

Although Yrigoyen was elected president in

1916, the traditional interests were conﬁdent
that they could keep control of the polity and
the economy.They were mistaken. Signiﬁcant
changes in the social structure had occurred,
with rapid immigration from Europe, induced by
economic success, and the associated urbaniza-
tion.The vote share of the Conservatives
declined rapidly and the prospect of a Radical
Party majority was a key factor behind the coup
of 1930. Smith (1978) notes “this situation con-
trasts sharply with that in Sweden and Great
Britain . . . where traditional elites continued to
dominate systems after the extension of

suffrage” (21). From this point onward political
conﬂicts intensiﬁed, with a stream of coups and
redemocratizations that lasted until 1983.
Though among the richest countries in the
world in the 1920s, Argentina gradually slid back
to being a developing country.

Argentina shows that, even with poor insti-
tutions for political inclusion and conﬂict man-
agement, growth is possible if elites have good
investment opportunities and can manage to
forge compromises. But the booms eventually
unravel. Even when elites, such as the agricul-
turalists of the Argentine Pampas, face very
good investment opportunities, growth cannot
be sustained forever by agricultural export
booms. Moreover, the rents created by bad
institutions create conﬂict without fundamen-
tal balances of power in society.This meant that
democracy in Argentina after 1912 was unsta-
ble.The unchecked power of President
Yrigoyen in the 1920s induced a coup in 1930,
as did that of Perón in the 1940s and in 1955
and again in 1976 after his return from exile.
Although temporary political solutions can
sometimes ease conﬂict for a while, as they did
in Argentina after 1853, in the absence of
broader institutional inclusion, conﬂict
ultimately reemerges, undermining the incen-
tives to investment.

including  a  highly  punitive, almost  penal,
effort  to  make  money. Such  efforts  quickly
collapsed, however, and  by  1619  the  Com-
pany  had  created  an  unusually  representa-
tive set of institutions for that era: a general
assembly with adult male suffrage.

The  early  history  of the  United  States
shows a possible path to good institutions.
Early attempts to create an oligarchic soci-
ety  with  close  control  of
labor  quickly
collapsed. What  emerged  instead  was  a
relatively egalitarian society, with represen-
tative  institutions  giving  even  the  poorest
colonists access to the law and some politi-
cal  representation. This  laid  the  basis  for
economic  and  social 
that
underpinned  the  takeoff of
the  United
States  in  the  nineteenth  century  and  its
divergence  from  the  fortunes  of much  of
Latin  America. Some  countries  with  weak
and  unequal  institutions  have  experienced
periods  of rapid  growth, but  these  have
proved  to  be  unsustainable  over  the  long
term (box 6.2).

institutions 

Institutions and political
inequality matter 
for development:
contemporary evidence
Our review of comparative history supports
two  conclusions. First, institutions, espe-
cially  those  that  underpin  property  rights
for all and broad-based investment, have a
causative  influence  on  long-run  develop-
ment processes. And second, greater polit-
ical  equality  can  lay  the  basis  for  better
economic  institutions. By  greater  political
equality, we mean, in particular, checks on
the predatory behavior of political and eco-
nomic  elites, and  the  political  need  for  the
state to be responsive to middle and poorer
population  groups. The  basis  for  greater
political  equalities  is  often  associated  with
underlying  economic  structures, although
causation can run both ways.

How  does  this  perspective  relate  to  the
variety of contemporary development expe-
riences? It is consistent with the perspective

114

WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2006

that institutions and governance are central
to  a  wide  variety  of development  perform-
from  growth  to  service  delivery.12
ance,
While debate continues, an important thrust
of this research has been to support the view
that causation runs, at least in part, from bet-
ter  institutions  to  higher  incomes, rather
than  the  other  way.13 What  is  additional  to
this  (ongoing)  debate  is  the  second  part  of
the argument—that the nature and manage-
ment of inequalities in power shapes the for-
mation  of institutions. Some  cross-country
analysis is suggestive: Rodrik (1999a) argues
that  the  capacity  of societies  to  manage
adverse shocks—itself a crucial determinant
of growth—depends on the depth of latent
social  conﬂict  and  the  strength  of conﬂict
management mechanisms.

To  illustrate  the  argument, we  continue
to draw on comparative development expe-
riences. We ﬁrst look at East Asia, and then
look  at  agricultural  pricing  polices  in
Africa. We  then  examine  in  greater  depth
the  comparative  experience  of Mauritius
and  Guyana, countries  that  started  with
similar initial conditions, but then followed
radically different development paths. This
is  also  related  to  different  experiences  in
managing  polarization, which  can  be  con-
tributory factors for violent social conﬂict.

Shared growth in East Asia: 
the Republic of Korea, Taiwan
(China), and Indonesia
Elites may be forced by threats of social disor-
der to promote the prosperity of most citi-
zens. Indeed, societies  that  have  a  political
necessity to appeal to or appease middle and
lower  groups  (initially  the  peasantry)  can
grow  substantially  in  the  short  run. Long-
run prosperity, however, requires institution-
alized, rather  than  contingent  checks  and
balances  on  elite  power  and  capacities  to
adjust 
to  changing  circumstances. The
response  of elites  to  social  disturbances
sometimes  leads  to  solutions  that  perma-
nently change the political equilibrium in a
beneﬁcial  way, as  may  have  happened  with
the  agrarian  reforms  in  the  Republic  of
Korea  and  Taiwan, China, in  the  late  1940s
and  early  1950s. More  often, however, the
transitory ability of citizens to act collectively
dissipates  without  elites  having  to  propose

anything more than a transitory solution, as
may have been the case in Indonesia under
the New Order.

The rapid economic development of the
Republic  of Korea  after  the  mid-1960s  was
not due to a set of institutions put in place
through  a  domestic  balance  of political
power. Instead, as  in  Indonesia  under  the
New Order regime, a precarious geopolitical
situation, particularly  after  the  rundown  of
U.S. aid in the early 1960s, induced the Park
regime  to  create  a  pro-growth  environ-
ment.14 This at least led to a contingent com-
mitment to good institutions, as it did under
an  authoritarian  regime  in  Taiwan, China,
where  a  fairly  egalitarian  distribution  of
assets and incomes, perhaps eased the transi-
tion  in  the  1990s  toward  democracy, a
greater  equality  of political  inﬂuence, and
good  institutions. As  in  much  of East Asia,
there  was  a  political  necessity  to  deliver
income growth and services to the peasantry.
In  Indonesia, Suharto’s  New  Order  gov-
ernment  also  recognized  that  economic
growth was necessary to keep the regime in
power  and  that, to  achieve  this, good  eco-
nomic  policies  had  to  be  in  place. This
induced Suharto to delegate macroeconomic
policy  to  technocrats  and  to  respond  to  the
oil booms wisely. It also led him to intervene
to attempt to control corruption and excesses
that  would  put  in  jeopardy  the  underpin-
nings of the regime.15

institutions,

Yet this constraint, real though it was, at
least in the 1960s and 1970s, is only part of
the story about Indonesian growth. Suharto
managed to create a system that, while not
introducing  good 
induced
investments  and  growth  from  which  the
regime  could  beneﬁt. One  of the  secrets
behind this appears to have been the role of
Sino-Indonesian  businessmen, the  cukong
entrepreneurs. Many  ﬁrms  and  businesses
were controlled by Indonesians of Chinese
origin  who  were  very  marginal  politically.
Suharto granted such businessmen mono-
poly rights and placed members of the mil-
itary and his supporters on their boards of
directors.16 Rock  (2003)  argues, “There  is

nomic  projects” (10). Yet  they  also  gener-
ated  wealth, economic  growth, and  rents
for the regime. It was precisely the political
marginality  of the  cukong entrepreneurs
that made them an attractive business part-
ner for the regime.

The  economic  success  of Indonesia  after
1966  elevated  it  into  the  class  of an  Asian
“miracle economy.”17 The East Asia ﬁnancial
crisis in 1997, however, exposed and exacer-
bated  Indonesia’s  institutional  weaknesses,
plummeting  the  country  into  an  economic
and political crisis from which it is only now
beginning to recover, doing so on the basis of
a  new  foundation  of decentralization  and
democracy, which have progressively institu-
tionalized  greater  relationships  of accounta-
bility between citizens and state. (See focus 4
on Indonesia for a further discussion of the
relationship between social and political con-
text and policy choices.)

Agricultural pricing policies 
in Africa
Another important example illustrating the
connections  between  institutions, the  dis-
tribution  of political  power  and  growth
comes  from  the  seminal  studies  of price
regulation prices in agricultural markets in
Africa  by  Robert  Bates.18 Bates  (1981)
demonstrated  that  poor  agricultural  per-
formance  in  Ghana, Nigeria, and  Zambia
was due to government-controlled market-
ing  boards  systematically  paying  farmers
prices  much  below  world  levels. The  mar-
keting  board  surpluses  were  given  to  the
government  as  a  form  of taxation. As  a
result  of this  pernicious  taxation, reaching
up to 70 percent of the value of the crop in
Ghana in the 1970s, investment in agricul-
ture  collapsed, as  did  the  output  of cocoa
and  other  crops. In  poor  countries  with  a
comparative  advantage  in  agriculture, this
meant negative rates of economic growth.

Why were resources extracted in this way?
Although part of the motivation was to pro-
mote industrialization, the main one was to
generate resources that could be either expro-
priated  or  redistributed  to  maintain  power.
As Bates (1981) put it,

governments  face  a  dilemma: urban  unrest,
which  they  cannot  successfully  eradicate

through  co-optation  or  repression, poses  a
serious challenge to their interests . . . Their
response  has  been  to  try  to  appease  urban
interests not by offering higher money wages
but by advocating policies aimed at reducing
the cost of living, and in particular the cost of
food. Agricultural policy thus becomes a by-
product  of political  relations  between  gov-
ernments and urban constituents (33).

In  contrast  to  the  situation  in  Ghana,
Nigeria, and  Zambia, Bates  (1981), Bates
(1989)  showed  that  agricultural  policy  in
Kenya over this period was much more pro-
farmer. The difference was due to who con-
trolled the marketing board. In Kenya, farm-
ers  were  not  smallholders, as  they  were  in
Ghana, Nigeria, and  Zambia, and  concen-
trated  landownership  made  it  much  easier
to  act  collectively. Moreover, farming  was
important  in  the  Kikuyu  areas, an  ethnic
group  closely  related  to  the  ruling  political
party, the  Kenya  African  National  Union
(KANU), under  Jomo  Kenyatta.19 Farmers
in Kenya therefore formed a powerful lobby
and were able to guarantee themselves high
prices. Even  though  the  government  of
Kenya  engaged  in  land  reform  after  inde-
pendence, Bates (1981) argued that—

80 percent of the former white highlands were
left intact and . . . the government took elabo-
rate measures to preserve the integrity of the
large-scale farms . . . [which] readily combine
in defense of their interests. One of the most
important  collective  efforts  is  the  Kenya
National  Farmer’s  Union  (KNFU)  . . . The
organization  . . . is  dominated  by  the  large-
scale farmers . . . [but] it can be argued that
the  KNFU  helps  to  create  a  framework  of
public  policies  that  provides  an  economic
environment favorable to all farmers (93–4).

Bates concluded that in Kenya “large farm-
ers . . . have secured public policies that are
highly favorable by comparison to those in
other nations” (95).

Bates  demonstrated  why  economic  poli-
cies were better in Kenya than Ghana in the
1960s and 1970s, but this advantage did not
survive the coming to power of Daniel arap
Moi  in  Kenya.20 The  change  in  the  ethnic
basis of the regime, from Kikuyu to Kalenjin,
undermined  the  coalition  that  had  sup-
ported  good  agricultural  policies, because
the export farmers were not only large, but

also predominantly Kikuyu. As a result, eco-
nomic  performance  declined  precipitously
in  the  1980s  and  1990s. The  balance  of
power  that  sustained  good  policies  in  the
1970s did not endure.

The contrasting experience 
of Mauritius and Guyana
Mauritius  and  Guyana, in  the  1960s, were
both  poor  societies  dominated  by  the  pro-
duction and export of sugarcane. They had
similar histories, factor endowments, social
and  political  cleavages, and  institutions. If
anything, Guyana, although slightly poorer,
had better prospects, because of its proxim-
ity  to  the  large  U.S. market. Yet  Mauritius
has  become  one  of the  most  dynamic  and
successful (and equal) developing countries,
industrializing and maintaining competitive
democratic  politics. Guyana  slumped  into
dictatorship and poverty.

The  divergence  between  Mauritius  and
Guyana since independence is a fascinating
example  of economic  and  political  diver-
gence  in  apparently  similar  societies  (ﬁg-
ures 6.5 and 6.6).

What  can  explain  this?  Both  countries
have  similar  histories. Mauritius  was  taken
from the French and Guyana from the Dutch
during  the  Napoleonic  wars.21 In  the  nine-
teenth  century  both  developed  sugarcane
economies and, after the abolition of slavery
in the British Empire in 1834, imported large
numbers of indentured laborers from India.
Both  have  a  similar  population  structure,
with  Indo-Guyanese  and  Indo-Mauritians
forming the majority of the population with
signiﬁcant  minorities  of people  of African,
European, and Chinese descent.

After  World  War  II, both  colonies  were
moved  by  the  British  toward  independence
with early elections for democratic legislative
assemblies  dominated  by  pro-independence
political  parties  led  by  Seewoosagur  Ram-
goolam  in  Mauritius  and  Cheddi  Jagan  in
Guyana. Both groups used extensive socialist
rhetoric  and  proposed  land  reforms  and
fairly  radical  policies. Many  of the  political
struggles  with  British  administrators  over
postindependence  institutions, such  as  the
form of the electoral system, were fought over
similar issues. As independence arrived how-
ever, political  forces  re-formed  into  a  situa-

tion in which parties led by Indo-Mauritians
and Indo-Guyanese faced a coalition of par-
ties supported by the non-Indian population,
led by Gaetan Duval in Mauritius and Forbes
Burnham  in  Guyana. Yet, at  independence,
politics and economics diverged.

The  Mauritian  Labour  Party  won  power
initially  and  quickly  abandoned  its  radical
policies—by  the  early  1970s, investment  in
the  export  processing  zone  had  begun. The
political hegemony of the Labour Party was
quickly contested by a strong socialist party,
the MMM (Mouvement Militant Mauricien)
led by Paul Berenger and Dev Virahsawmy. In
response, the  Labour  Party  entered  a  coali-
tion  with  Duval  and  his  PMSD  (Parti
Mauricien Social Democrate) and the previ-
ous  opposition  groups. The  Labour  Party
drew back from repressing the new political
forces, allowed the MMM to contest the 1976
election, and instead adopted social policies,
such as the provision of universal secondary
education, to  improve  its  popularity. It  also
quickly  dropped  populist  macroeconomic
policies and, in the late 1970s, implemented a
serious stabilization program under the IMF.
The  ﬁnal  test  of Mauritian  institutions  was
the election of an MMM government for the
ﬁrst time in 1982. Once in power, the MMM
abandoned  its  more  radical  policies, and
when the broad political consensus for good
institutions became clear, the export process-
ing zone boomed.

The  contrast  with  Guyana  is  stark. The
ﬁrst election on the eve of independence was
won  by  Burnham  and  his  People’s  National
Party  in  a  coalition  against  Jagan’s  People’s
Progressive  Party. Burnham  maintained
power  by  increasingly  fraudulent  means,
ﬁnally  changing  the  constitution  in  1980  to
make himself executive president. He assassi-
nated opponents, most famously the radical
economist and political activist Walter Rod-
ney in 1980. The economic policies of Burn-
ham’s regime were a disaster. He expropriated
the  sugar  plantations, creating  highly  inefﬁ-
cient  state  industries, and  he  aggressively
promoted  his  party  members 
through
patronage, particularly in the civil service. The
implied or actual threat to property and per-
son led to a huge diaspora of Indo-Guyanese
from the country, including most of the pro-
fessional and middle-class people. Only in the

1990s  did  a  democratized  Guyana  begin  to
slowly recover from this legacy. But the ethnic
divide endures, and the country continues to
suffer from weak governance, a lack of politi-
cal  transparency, and  ethnic  tensions  that
hamper economic and social development.

What can explain such divergent outcomes
in such apparently similar circumstances? In
Guyana, there were fewer constraints on the
use  of power, and  political  conﬂict  was
more polarized, deﬁned solely along ethnic
lines. And  although  both  countries  started
independence  as  democracies, what  the
majority could do (or wanted to do) to the
minority was limited in Mauritius, but not
in Guyana.

In  Mauritius, the  British  colonial  state
faced a powerful and homogeneous French
planter  class  that  did  not  leave  the  island
after  Mauritius  was  annexed  to  Britain  in
1812. In  the  1870s, when  Britain  was
reducing the autonomy of colonial admin-
istrations, it was forced to create a legisla-
tive  assembly. Although  this  was  initially
dominated by the planters, by the turn of
the twentieth century the first Indo-Mau-
ritians  were  elected. This  was  a  clear  sign
that the greater political autonomy of the
island was allowing for a more open soci-
ety  with  greater  upward  mobility  of for-
mer indentured laborers. The power of the
colonial  state  was  checked, evident  in  the
fact  that  Mauritian  independence  leaders
were able in the 1960s to negotiate postin-
dependence institutions closer to the ones
they wanted.

This 

juxtaposition  of different 

local
interests and the weakening of the legacy of
the  colonial  state  gave  rise  to  a  more  bal-
anced  distribution  of political  power  in
Mauritius. And  from  this  situation  more
ﬂuid  interests  emerged. Though  ethnic
identities were certainly important in poli-
tics, so  were  different  cleavages, as  is  clear
from the development of the MMM into a
powerful political force and the coalition of
Ramgoolam  and  Duval  in  the  1970s. Poli-
tics  became  much  less  polarized  than  they
might have been.

In  Guyana, there  was  no  indigenous
planter class to check the power of the colo-
nial state. After the departure of the Dutch,
the plantations came to be owned by absen-

Equity, institutions, and the development process

117

tee  British  companies. The  authoritarian
tendencies  of the  colonial  state  were  rein-
forced by British military intervention, pro-
moted  in  1953  by  the  United  States, to
remove  Jagan  from  power  because  of his
socialist  tendencies. Guyanese  politicians,
unlike those in Mauritius, had far less abil-
ity to get what they wanted from the colo-
nial state. This meant that there were fewer
indigenous checks on the exercise of power,
and  unfettered  use  of political  power  was
the norm. The best example here is the elec-
toral  system. Britain  imposed  a  propor-
tional  representation  system  on  Guyana
because it was afraid that the overrepresen-
tation of large parties inherent in majoritar-
ian  systems  would  allow  Jagan  to  win  an
absolute majority in the 1964 election (the
People’s Progressive Party won 42.6 percent
of the vote in the 1961 election). This sys-
tem facilitated Burnham’s rise to power.

Although the British tried to do the same
thing in Mauritius, political elites there held
out and forced a compromise: a system with
relatively  large  electoral  districts  with  the
three  politicians  who  got  the  most  votes
being elected and with the eight best “losers”
from the entire country being elected to par-
liament. This  system  maintained  elements
of the majoritarian institutions that Maurit-
ian leaders believed were essential to main-
taining  the  country’s  governability. Politics
in Guyana became completely deﬁned along
ethnic lines. This occurred because the pre-
vious  evolution  of the  economy, and  the
dominant  power  of colonial  interests, left
little  room  for  the  varied  interests  that
emerged  in  Mauritius. While  Guyana  has
not  suffered  outright  social  conﬂict, high
levels  of polarization  and  weak  conﬂict
management  institutions  can  be  contribu-
tory factors to civil wars (box 6.3).

Implications
In Mauritius, property rights are secure and
the  country  has  experienced  open  demo-
cratic  politics. There  has  been  intensive
investment in education and free access into
proﬁtable  investment  opportunities,
illus-
trated most clearly by the export processing
zone. In Guyana, the opposite was true in the
1970s and 1980s. The puzzle is why institu-
tions have been so good in one case and so

B O X   6 . 3 Polarization, conﬂict, and growth

Researchers have long recognized that
deep social divisions make it harder to
implement policies that benefit all. Getting
a more precise measure of the nature and
extent of such divisions, however, has
proved problematic. For much of the
1990s, scholars used a measure known as
“ethno-linguistic fractionalization”—first
compiled by Russian social scientists in the
1960s—to show that economic growth
was slower, controlling for other factors, in
societies where there was a low probability
that two citizens drawn randomly from a
population group were of the same ethnic
group. Africa’s “growth tragedy” was, in
part, blamed on its high level of “fractional-
ization” (Easterly and Levine 1997).

More recent work has sought to reﬁne

measures of social diversity by focusing
instead on polarization, or the extent to
which a small number of inﬂuential groups
dominate a society, thereby providing a
more theoretically informed basis for
explaining the relationship between diver-

sity and conﬂict, and through this channel,
economic growth (Esteban and Ray 1994).
By this measure, a country with three
groups that comprise, respectively, 49 per-
cent, 49 percent and 2 percent of the popu-
lation will be more polarized than a coun-
terpart country where those same groups
comprise 33 percent, 33 percent, and 34
percent of the population.The polarization
measure is a far more robust predictor of
civil conﬂict than either measures of the
inequality of individual incomes or
fragmentation.This statistical association is
illustrated by the fact that, by this measure,
9 of the 10 most polarized societies in the
world have experienced major civil conﬂict
in the past few decades, including Eritrea,
Guatemala, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, and Bosnia
and Herzegovina (García-Montalvo and 
Reynal-Querol forthcoming).This is only one
inﬂuence on conﬂict, of course, and other
work has emphasized the role of resource
dependence and state capacities (see World
Bank 2003h).

bad in the other, given such apparently sim-
ilar histories and circumstances.

But  the  two  cases  make  sense  in  more
detail. The  colonial  history  of Mauritius
diverged from Guyana’s in signiﬁcant ways
that allowed the development of a stronger
domestic  political  society. Mauritius  resis-
ted  the  colonial  state  more  effectively  and,
ultimately, generated  a  more  egalitarian
distribution  of political  power  and  a  less
polarized  structure  of political  conﬂict. In
Guyana, however, there  was  no  powerful
domestic  interest  group  that  had  a  vested
interest in opposing the colonial state or that
was able to block the state from expropriat-
ing  land  and  other  assets  after  independ-
ence. The use of power was unconstrained,
and  politics  were  highly  polarized  along
ethnic lines.

Indonesia shows that growth is possible
even with underlying bad institutions when
elites can credibly make a contingent com-
mitment to improve institutions and when
they manage to forge mechanisms that indi-
rectly beneﬁt from encouraging the invest-
ment opportunities of others. The accelera-
tion of growth after 1966, and particularly
the pro-poor aspect of growth, was clearly
driven  by  the  threat  of communism  and

rural social disorder. The spillover from the
conﬂicts of 1965 and 1966 was a redistribu-
tion of power toward the rural sector, with
sustained, inclusive  growth  necessary  for
the political survival of the regime.

Yet  the  redistribution  of power 

in
Indonesia  was  not  institutionalized, unlike
what occurred in the Republic of Korea, for
example. Moreover, it did not force the New
Order Regime to improve institutions out-
side  the  rural  and  education  sectors,
although  the  connection  between  promot-
ing economic development and social order
may  well  have  helped  the  government  to
sustain  its  relationship  with  the  cukong
entrepreneurs. As  the  constraints  on  eco-
nomic  policies  of the  New  Order  Regime
relaxed in the 1990s, it appears to have been
more difﬁcult to avoid a massive and debili-
tating upsurge in corruption and rent-seek-
ing. Moreover, the collusive agreement that
the  state  forged  with  the  Sino-Indonesian
entrepreneurs  appears  to  have  been  very
fragile. It  rested  on  shared  expectations
about  the  longevity  of
the  relationship,
expectations  that  clearly  deteriorated  with
Suharto’s failing health and could not sur-
vive the ﬁnancial crisis in 1997.22

Transitions to more equitable
institutions
So  far  we  have  examined  cases  illustrating
the  mechanisms  that  create  good  institu-
tions  and  sustain  prosperity. They  involve
institutions that allow for greater equality of
opportunity, and behind such a set of insti-
tutions  lies  a  relative  balance  of economic
resources and political power. Such institu-
tions have emerged in some societies but not
others. Although  systems  of
institutions
often tend to reinforce one another and per-
sist  for  long  periods, they  also  change.
Countries  with  unequal  distributions  of
resources and political power become more
egalitarian  and  democratic, and  previously
powerless people gain power and inﬂuence.
Although institutions are sometimes created
by  colonialism  or  military  conquest, they
can  often  evolve  through  good  decisions,
virtuous  paths, and  the  intrinsic  dynamics
of the development process, as in Mauritius.
It is also possible that even transitory condi-

Equity, institutions, and the development process

119

tional  solutions  lead  to  permanent  change,
because  growth  unleashes  transformations
that  induce  beneﬁcial  changes  in  institu-
tions. This  message  from  modernization
theory23 is  precisely  what  may  have  hap-
pened in the Republic of Korea.

The  biggest  challenge  is  to  understand
processes of change and to distill from them
lessons  about  how  poorer  societies  can
undergo  beneﬁcial  institutional  transitions.
This  does  not  appear  to  have  happened  in
Argentina  (box  6.2)  or  Guyana, but  it  did
happen  in  Britain  in  the  seventeenth, eigh-
teenth, and nineteenth centuries and in Fin-
land, Sweden, Spain, and  the  Republic  of
Korea  in  the  twentieth  century. It  also  hap-
pened  in  Mauritius. Here  we  brieﬂy  review
three such transitions: early modern Britain,
Finland  and  Sweden  in  the  early  twentieth
century, and China in the last 20 years. The
transitions  and  policy  choices  in  Spain  are
discussed in focus 3 on Spain.

Early modern Britain 
Around  1500  most  European  countries
were  highly  hierarchical  feudal  societies
ruled  by  absolute  monarchs  whose  powers
were  endowed  by  God. The  most  prosper-
ous places, such as the Italian city states of
Venice, Genoa  and  Florence, had  escaped
feudalism  and  were  ruled  by  republican
governments strongly representing mercan-
tile interests. The Netherlands also escaped
intense  feudalism  and  was  relatively  pros-
perous, but  it  was  part  of the  autocratic
Habsburg Empire. Nevertheless, the differ-
ences in income between the most and the
least  prosperous  places  were  relatively
small. After  1500, this  picture  began  to
change  rapidly. First  the  Netherlands  and
then  Britain  became  much  more  prosper-
ous  than  the  rest  of Europe, and  the
Mediterranean world went into decline.

As North and Thomas (1973) argued, the
most plausible explanation for these changes
is  the  emergence  of constitutional  govern-
ment in the Netherlands and Britain: diverg-
ing prosperity within the early modern period
was tied to the evolution of political institu-
tions.24 Institutions  improved  because  of a
change  in  the  distribution  of resources  and
political power. Indeed, there was a virtuous
circle  of changes  in  institutions, the  broader

distribution  of resources  and  power, and
subsequent  changes  in  institutions. These
changes  included  the  collapse  of feudalism
and  serfdom  and  the  move  to  a  free  labor
market, the changes in land distribution, the
commercialization  of agriculture  and  the
development of interoceanic commerce.25

Yet, even after 1688, the political system
was  at  root  oligarchic. Further  changes
were  needed  in  the  distribution  of power
toward greater political equality to sustain
Britain’s  development  path  and  eventually
deliver  a  more  egalitarian  society. Even
though Britain was a constitutional regime,
it  was  a  very  limited  democracy  in  1800.
Before  the  ﬁrst  reform  act  of 1832  set  in
motion political liberalizations that culmi-
nated in full democracy in 1918, fewer than
10  percent  of adult  males  could  vote. The
reason for these changes seems to have been
the  effect  of early  industrialization  and
urbanization on the ability of the disenfran-
chised  to  contest  the  power  of political
elites.26 British democratization in the nine-
teenth century was the outcome of a series
of strategic concessions by political elites to
avoid social disorder.27

While  the  political  system  of the  eigh-
teenth century was consistent with individ-
ual initiative, invention, and the start of the
industrial  revolution  in  Britain, sustained
long-run  growth  called  for  broad  invest-
ment, particularly  in  human  capital. Such
institutions  had  to  wait  for  mass  democ-
racy  to  begin  to  arrive  after  1867.28 How-
ever, the  longer  history  of the  Poor  Laws
provide  an  example  of how  provisioning
for  adverse  risks  was  also  supportive  of
greater  dynamism  (box  6.4)—a  theme  we
return to in chapter 7.

The types of political reforms in nineteenth-
century Britain led to economic institutions
that  clearly  inﬂuenced  the  distribution  of
income, most  obviously  the  promotion  of
education  after  1867. But  the  same  period
also saw extensive labor market reforms that
strengthened the bargaining power of labor
and led to the rise of the Labor Party. After
1906, the  Liberal  government  of Herbert
Asquith also began to introduce the basics of
a welfare state, further extended by the Labor
government  after  1945. As  Britain  began  to
adopt institutions that promoted prosperity,

B O X   6 . 4 Aiding equitable growth in early modern

Britain: the role of the Poor Laws

Far from being a consequence of successful
economic growth, recent historical research
on seventeenth- and eighteenth-century
Britain has found that widespread but
unique institutions of social security were in
existence for several centuries before the
industrial revolution. Indeed, scholars
increasingly argue that a previously under-
estimated inﬂuence on Britain’s industrial
revolution, in fact, lies in its prior agricultural
revolution.The principal comparator here is
with the immensely advanced Dutch rural
and trading economy of the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries. Many of the most
important technical innovations in British
agriculture during this period, such as land
drainage engineering, new crop types, and
rotations, were directly borrowed from the
Dutch.Yet it was the British agricultural and
service economy that was increasingly out-
pacing the Dutch as the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries progressed.Why?
Attention has recently been given to

one major institutional difference between
the two countries—the nationwide system
of social security created in England by the
Poor Laws, which gradually evolved during
the course of the sixteenth century, culmi-
nating in the famous Elizabethan statutes of
1598 and 1601.This was a Christian human-
ist response, imbued with a new optimism
about what government could and should
be able to achieve in the face of perceptions
of increased poverty amid plenty in a time
of population growth.The Poor Law was
mandated by the central state but—most
important for its practical effectiveness—its
implementation was entirely locally
devolved: it was funded by a local tax on
property in every parish, administered by
local ofﬁcials but also rigorously enforced by
local magistrates. It went side by side with a
relatively efﬁcient nationwide population
registration system, the Church of England’s

parish registers, which was instituted in
1538.This placed the English population on
an entirely different basis, in terms of social
security, from that of the rest of Europe.

The comprehensive social security system

provided by the Poor Laws had a number of
highly signiﬁcant economic consequences.In
combination with laws (dating from the thir-
teenth century) granting complete alienability
of land,it encouraged labor mobility and
reduced the attachment to land holding as
the only form of security for peasants.Individ-
uals had a relative certainty of being provided
for,wherever they moved to work in the econ-
omy,no matter what their property-owner-
ship status.Landlords and farmers could reap
the economic gains to be had from increased
farm sizes,from enclosure,and from laying off
workers or changing their labor contracts to
more efﬁcient weekly or day labor,without
provoking the same degree of peasant
protest as occurred on the continent.But
equally,employers in England had a strong
incentive only to do this if it made economic
sense because,through the Poor Law,they
would also have to reckon with their liability
to pay for the families of the laid-off workers.
What the Poor Law created in England
was a public system of acknowledgment of
collective responsibility for the basic subsis-
tence of all, including for a strikingly non-
moralistic approach to the support of single
mothers and their illegitimate children.The
comparative evidence suggests a relative
lack of correspondence in England—alone
in all of Europe—between ﬂuctuations in
the price of food and the death rate, and
England—but not Ireland—was the ﬁrst
nation in the world to cease to experience

it  was  still  a  highly  unequal  society, and
inequality almost certainly increased until the
early or mid-nineteenth century (ﬁgure 6.7).
Although precise measures of inequality dif-
fer  depending  on  the  sources,
inequality
appears to have risen until the early and per-
haps  mid-nineteenth  century.29 After  about
1870, there is wide consensus that inequality
fell substantially for the next century.

The fall in inequality after 1870 is closely
correlated  with  the  Second  Reform  Act  of

1867, which  was  the  ﬁrst  reform  that  really
expanded  voting  rights  to  working  people.

Twentieth-century Finland 
and Sweden31
Finland  and  Sweden  are  popularly  identi-
ﬁed as prosperous countries with generous
welfare  states  that, in  some  measure, are
products of a small and ethnically homoge-
nous  population. But, a  closer  reading  of
their  economic  histories  shows  that  their
contemporary  “virtuous 
circles”—with
growth  and  equity  mutually  reinforcing—
are  the  outcome  of a  long  and  difﬁcult
political  struggle  to  establish  institutions
and  enact  policies  that  provide  broad  eco-
nomic  opportunities  and  respond  to  the
inherently  wrenching  social  transitions  of
positive 
structural
change)  and  negative  shocks  (macroeco-
nomic crises, civil war).

(economic  growth,

Finland was part of Sweden in the Middle
Ages, but following a war between Russia and
Sweden  in  1808–09, it  became  part  of the
Russian empire. It experienced one of the last
European famines in 1867–68, an event that
ushered  in  major  demographic  and  eco-
nomic changes as entire regions were devas-
tated. The Russian revolution of 1917 led to a
collapse of imperial authority in Finland, and
the country soon declared its independence.
But this immediately gave birth to a bloody
civil war between “white guards” (bourgeois
nationalists) and “red guards” (socialists loyal
to  Russia). More  than  30,000  troops  alone
lost their lives.

In the aftermath, however, many progres-
sive reforms laid the foundation for the mod-
ern  Finnish  economy  and  society. Land
reform—a major cause of the civil war—was
enacted almost immediately. A law passed in
1918 allowed sharecroppers to buy their land,
and amendments in 1922 facilitated the sub-
sidized expansion of small farms. Progressive
income and wealth taxation were in place by
1920,
followed  by  expansions  of
women’s  rights  (although  universal  suffrage
in parliamentary elections had been in place
since 1906) and commitments by the central

soon 

government (not just local municipalities) to
primary education.

From the late 1940s until the early 1990s
the  economy  expanded  steadily, with  per
capita  incomes  catching  up  with  Great
Britain  in  the  1980s  and  Sweden  in  the
1990s (from roughly half a century earlier).
This  success  was  a  product  of Asian-style
“governed markets”: collaboration between
the state and private sector was harnessed to
rapidly  industrialize  an  economy  that, as
late as the 1950s, generated 40 percent of its
output  from  agriculture.32 A  crucial  coun-
terpart to Finland’s activist industrial policy
(based  on  high  rates  of capital  accumula-
tion and public saving, low interest rates on
credit, and major investments in manufac-
turing  infrastructure), however, was  the
construction  of a  welfare  state  to  cushion
citizens  of all  ages  against  the  unsettling
social changes wrought by such a rapid eco-
nomic transformation.

Strong  and  credible  political  leadership
was  central  to  making  this  possible. In  the
aftermath  of World  War  II, President  Urho
Kekkoken famously asked his nation, “Do we
have the patience to prosper?” Thereafter, he
set  about  negotiating  the  arrangements
(“social  corporatism”)  among  industrialists,
trade unions, and citizen groups that would
enable all to act as complements. The Finnish
model  has  its  problems  (high  unemploy-
ment), but  it  shows  how  state, market, and
society  can  jointly  generate  the  institutions,
policies, and spaces needed to generate equi-
table development outcomes.

Sweden  is  perhaps  most  closely  associ-
ated with the welfare state today. Less well
known  is  the  timing  and  sequencing  of
events putting it in place. Importantly, the
Swedish  welfare  state  was  the  product  of,
not a precursor to, the country’s transition
to modern economic growth. Indeed, it was
designed in response to the very problems
(old-age  security, unemployment)  gener-
ated  by  such  growth. But  to  make  such
growth  possible, and  to  have  in  place
sociopolitical conditions that would enable
the  articulation  of and  sustained  support
for something like the welfare state (when
such a system existed only in rather embry-
onic  forms  elsewhere  in  the  capitalist
world), it was vital that a prior set of equi-

place.

In  Sweden,

these  prior  arrangements
were unusually favorable to upward mobil-
ity by subordinate groups: a long history of
peasant autonomy, a correspondingly weak
aristocracy, and  an  emerging  nation-state
able  to  secure  support  from  farmers  while
also  repudiating  aristocratic  claims  on  its
powers. Sweden was also the ﬁrst country to
have a central bank (in 1668) and among the
ﬁrst to grant basic property rights. As such,
“inclusion  of the  peasantry  in  the  trans-
formation  of the  agrarian  economy  and
institutional  arrangements  that  sustained
egalitarianism were to become fundamental
elements in the rise of the Swedish industrial
market  economy.”33 This  was  an  economy
increasingly  grounded  in  broad  political
rights and social opportunities.

But  history  is  not  destiny. Equitable
development  is  as  much  a  function  of key
choices  and  decisions  at  pivotal  historic
junctures. The  Middle  Ages, the  industrial
revolution, and  the  tumultuous  twentieth
century  unleashed  sweeping  forces  on
Swedish society. Some were leveling (rising
agricultural  productivity), others  wrench-
ing (mass unemployment). Each attempt to
respond  to  these  forces  established  the
political contours for subsequent attempts.
Drawing  on  and  extending  the  equitable
institutional foundations during these piv-
otal historic junctures have been the unify-
ing  elements  of Sweden’s  development
strategy. Its achievements to date have been
remarkable, even  as  twenty-ﬁrst-century
realities present distinctive challenges to its
welfare state.

WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2006

The main implications of the Finnish and
Swedish  cases  for  today’s  developing  coun-
tries are that economic growth and sociopo-
litical  equity  can  be  powerfully  reinforcing,
and  can  be  underpinned  by  institutional
transitions. These cases should not be seen as
blueprints for others to follow. Instead, they
should be read as examples of how commit-
ments to equity in a given context help lay the
foundations  for  short-  and  long-term  pros-
perity by consolidating virtuous circles link-
ing institutions and incentives.

China in the late twentieth century
Economic development in China since 1978
has been nothing short of spectacular. With
the quadrupling of GDP per capita over the
last  25  years, China  has  transformed  itself
from  a  poor  centrally  planned  economy  to 
a  lower-middle-income  emerging  market
economy. As a result, the number of people
living in poverty (under $1 per day) fell from
634 million in 1981 to 212 million in 2001.34
From the perspective of this chapter, what
is interesting is that the world’s largest coun-
try  has  undergone  profound  economic
transformation without substantially chang-
ing  the  political  institutional  structure, that
remains dominated by the Chinese Commu-
nist Party. Yet institutional improvement did
take  place  in  China  along  with  economic
reform. And  the  large  increase  in  nonstate
investment  and  free  entry  into  proﬁtable
economic  opportunities  suggest  that  prop-
erty rights are secure, despite the absence of a
Western-style judicial system.

While the particular institutional form is
different from other cases reviewed here, the
experience  in  China  is  broadly  consistent
with  the  thesis  of this  chapter. The  earlier
discussion of equitable transitions in Britain
and  Scandinavian  countries  illustrated  the
argument that a successful economic system
depends  on  the  political  system  to  assign
and  enforce  property  rights  and  contracts,
and  to  protect  the  market  from  political
encroachment. China’s  recent  history  sug-
gests  that  the  starting  point  for  reforms
does  not  necessarily  have  to  be  in  political
institutions. Changes  in  economic  institu-
tions and in economic relations among lev-
els of government can also establish credible
commitment to a reform path and act as a

check on the discretionary use of power by
the central government. China’s experience
also demonstrates that what is important for
equitable  development  are  credible  checks
on the arbitrary use of power, assurance of
property  rights  and  fair  treatment  for  a
broad  segment  of society. The  particular
form  that  institutions  take  to  deliver  these
functions can vary, especially during periods
of transition.

The key to China’s equitable development
was  the  combination  of initial  conditions
and the economic reforms launched in 1978
that unleashed entrepreneurial initiative and
legitimized  the  proﬁt  motive. China’s  eco-
nomic policies following the 1949 revolution
proved  seriously  ﬂawed: they  stiﬂed  incen-
tives for investment and innovation. But the
social  policies  of the  Mao  Tse-Tung  period
leveled the distribution of assets in important
and durable ways. As a result, both land and
human capital were equitably distributed on
the eve of reforms. With the adoption of the
rural  household  responsibility  system, peas-
ants  became  the  immediate  beneﬁciaries  of
reform. This helped to reinforce equity, while
unleashing  entrepreneurial 
initiative  and
boosting productivity.

The  economic  reforms  launched  in
1978  aimed  at  decentralizing  economic
decisions—to individual farm households,
enterprise managers, local governments—
so as to generate incentives for investment
and  innovation. Importantly, the  form
these  policies  took  and  the  transitional
institutions 
that  were  created  were
designed to preserve the political support
for  reforms, by  compensating  potential
losers.

The aftermath of the cultural revolution,
and  the  recognition  that  China’s  economy
had fallen behind—not least in relation to the
East Asian Tigers—led to a growing consen-
sus on the need for and urgency of change,
and paved the way for the economic reforms
initiated  under  Deng  Xiaoping’s  leadership.
These  reforms  were  inspired  by  the  wide-
spread  recognition  of the  failure  of central
planning  as  an  instrument  for  economic
organization, and reﬂected the need to deliver
on economic growth for the legitimacy of the
new leadership. The political need for growth
implied  a  new  focus  on  liberating  markets

and  incentives. The  sequencing  of reforms
and  the  transitional  institutional  arrange-
ments  that  accompanied  the  economic
decentralization, on the other hand, reﬂected
the premium the leadership placed on social
and political stability.

that  held 

The  impetus  for  economic  decentraliza-
tion  on  the  one  hand, and  the  need  for  an
integrated  national  market  on  the  other,
helped  to  shape  a  dynamic  relationship
between  the  central  government  and  local
governments 
them  mutually
accountable  and  limited  discretion  on  both
sides. Over  time, the  result  of these  policies
was to create a stake in new economic institu-
tions  for  all  the  main  actors, including  the
local governments which served as a credible
check  on  the  powers  of the  central  govern-
ment in the economic domain. The reforms
also fueled the emergence of strong economic
centers, such as Guangdong province and the
Shanghai  municipality. These  centers  now
wield considerable inﬂuence and bargaining
power relative to the central government and
can serve as important countervailing forces.
How did economic decentralization rein-
force private incentives? According to Walder
and Oi (1999), “For almost 20 years, reform
in China has proceeded through the gradual
reassignment of speciﬁc property rights from
higher government agencies to lower govern-
ment agencies, or from government agencies
to enterprises, managers, families, or individ-
uals” (7). All of these reforms enhanced the
power of economic agents to make decisions
over  economic  activities  in  their  respective
domains, and  boosted  productivity  through
better incentives. Farmers retained their earn-
ings  and  therefore  worked  harder  and
invested more. Township and village govern-
ments  had  rights  to  the  proﬁts  made  by
township and village enterprises (TVEs) and
therefore  adopted  policies  that  promoted
business. But  because  they  had  no  revenue
authority, they did not have the ability to bail
out poorly performing TVEs, which made for
hard budget constraints and higher efﬁciency.
Higher levels of local governments (coun-
try and province) acquired control over local
enterprises  and  therefore  also  had  a  stake  in
their  performance. They  were  allowed  to
retain more local revenues through ﬁscal con-
tracting  and  to  have  extrabudgetary  funds,

which  generated  incentives  that  focused  on
collection to provide local public goods that
attracted  local  investments. These  changes
provided  for  signiﬁcant  autonomy  from  the
central  government  and  considerable  inde-
pendent authority over their economies.

The  modern  Chinese  system  includes  a  divi-
sion of authority between the central and local
governments. The latter have primary control
over  economic  matters  within  their  jurisdic-
tions. Critically, there is an important degree
of political durability built into the system.35

income  for 

China’s reforms are also replete with inno-
vative  mechanisms  for  protecting  potential
losers during transitional periods. This often
involved  designing  reforms  that  sustained
sources  of
incumbents, by
keeping  important  elements  of pre-existing
pricing  and  payment  mechanisms, while
providing  incentives  at  the  margin. “The
transitional  institutions  [were]  not  created
solely for increasing the size of [the] pie, [but
also] to reﬂect the distributional concerns of
how the enlarged pie is divided and the polit-
ical concerns of how the interests of those in
power are served.”36

Dual  pricing  at  the  start  of reforms  is  a
prime  example. The  system  obliged  farmers
and enterprises to sell speciﬁed quantities to
the state at “plan” prices, while allowing them
to obtain market prices for any above-quota
production. This  maintained  the  planning
system for those who beneﬁted from it, while
creating  incentives  for  efﬁcient  production.
Equally important, it allowed time for market
institutions  to  emerge, avoiding  the  institu-
tional vacuum that plagued many transition
economies  when  state  institutions  were  dis-
mantled. Fiscal  contracting  guaranteed  the
central  government  a  certain  level  of rev-
enues,37 but it generated incentives for local
governments  to  collect  more  because  the
marginal  retention  rate  was  much  higher.
Similarly,
labor  contracting  allowed  state
workers  to  retain  the  guarantee  of lifetime
employment while introducing greater ﬂexi-
bility  in  labor  policies  for  new  contractual
workers. These arrangements made reforms a
win-win  game, ensuring  social  stability  and
the support of those in power.

But there is a danger in such a strategy of
incrementalism: getting stuck in incomplete

124

reforms  if local  governments  and  incum-
bents acquire too much power and are able
to block further progress. The prevalence of
interprovincial  barriers  to  trade  in  the
1990s, with  each  province  vying  to  boost
proﬁts  for  the  enterprises  it  owned, is  an
example. But there are some checks and bal-
ances  in  the  system  that  help  maintain  the
direction and momentum of reforms. These
include  competition  among  local  govern-
ments, hard  budget  constraints  for  local
governments,
the  central  government’s
insistence  on  enforcing  a  unitary  market,
and  a  growing  economy  that  reduces  the
economic inﬂuence of incumbents.

for 

The  struggle 

the  right  balance
between economic centralization and decen-
tralization  is  constantly  evident  in  many  of
China’s domains of intergovernmental rela-
tions. The 1994 tax reforms recentralized ﬁs-
cal  revenues,
in  part  to  ensure  greater
regional equity in spending, and the central
government  continues  to  apply  strict  con-
trols  on  deﬁcit  ﬁnancing  by  local  govern-
ments. Constraints  on  labor  mobility  have
eased considerably over time, helping to cre-
ate a more uniﬁed labor market, despite con-
cerns  by  some  provincial  governments  that
this might aggravate problems of unemploy-
ment for established urban residents.

There  are  also  some  more  recent  and
more  permanent  institutional  changes  that
reconﬁrm the government’s commitment to
market-oriented  reform. These 
include
mechanisms  that  strengthen  accountability
at the local level and empower local popula-
tions. Local elections are the most important
of these mechanisms but others include, for
example, recent regulations to eliminate nui-
sance  taxes  on  the  rural  population. China
has also successfully used the external com-
mitment device of WTO accession to signal
its  resolve  to  move  ahead  with  market
reforms  and  impose  discipline  on  incum-
bents. For  example, it  is  no  longer  possible
for every province to have its own inefﬁcient
automobile factory erected behind trade bar-
riers designed to provide local employment
and local taxes. More broadly, China’s desire
to carve for itself an important place in the
global  order  and  to  be  recognized  as  a
responsible  global  power  places  constraints
on the shape of its future policies.

There  is  apparently  a  larger  room  than  we
thought 
to
simultaneously  address  both  the  economic
and  political  concerns, that  is, to  make  a
reform  efﬁciency  improving  and  interest
compatible for those in power (305).

But there are many challenges ahead, some
of which  will  not  be  amenable  to  win-win
solutions and therefore are likely to be polit-
ically  and  socially  more  costly. Continued
reforms in the state enterprise and ﬁnancial
sectors, managing  rural-urban  migration,
and addressing increasing regional disparities
(see focus 6 on regional inequality) are some
of these  challenges. Macroeconomic  policy
and structural reforms will need to be under-
pinned by further institutional improvement
to ensure broader participation and account-
ability so that the interests and desire of the
people  are  better  reﬂected  in  decision  mak-
ing, and  to  further  strengthen  the  govern-
ment’s  capacity  to  lead  market-oriented
reform  while  maintaining  economic  and
social equity.

Conclusion
A  few  simple  principles  go  a  long  way
toward  unifying  different  development
experiences in the historic and the contem-
porary  worlds. There  is  little  disagreement
among scholars that basic institutions, such
as  security  of property  rights  and  equality
before the law, are keys to prosperity. These
institutions lie behind the capital, ﬁnancial,
land, and  labor  markets  that  we  saw  in
action in chapter 5. Because talent and ideas
are  widely  distributed  in  the  population, a
prosperous  modern  society  requires  the
mass of people to have incentives—and a
state  that  can  and  will  provide  key  com-
plementary  inputs  and  public  goods. It
therefore  requires  an  underlying  set  of
institutions  that  generate  the  equality  of
opportunity for individuals and assure the
accountability of politicians to all.

Why do some societies have such insti-
tutions  and  not  others?  A  relatively  egali-
tarian  distribution  of political  power
underpins  the  institutions  that  promote
prosperity. Institutions clearly have distrib-
utional  effects, and  bad  institutions  often

Equity, institutions, and the development process

125

arise  because  they  beneﬁt  some  group  or
elite. Good  institutions  arise  when  checks
are placed on the power of elites and when
the balance of political power becomes more
equal in society. Often, equality of political
power  is  supported  by  economic  equality,
and this connection gives rise to the possi-
bility of both virtuous and vicious circles.

Growth  certainly  can  occur  in  societies
in which these conditions do not apply. But
the preponderance of evidence suggests that
such growth is unsustainable. This perspec-
tive is consistent with historical narratives,
basic  patterns  in  cross-country  data, and
more careful causal empirical work on the
sources of prosperity.

The crucial question for the promotion
of development is this: how can poor soci-
eties  improve  their  institutions  and  move

onto a dynamic path toward a virtuous cir-
cle of equity and prosperity? The organiza-
tion  of society  is  highly  persistent, but  we
have seen many cases of transitions to bet-
ter  institutions. Sometimes, as  in  early
modern  Britain, economic  changes  lead  to
changes in the distribution of power, which
promotes a more equitable society and bet-
ter  institutions. Contemporary  China  fol-
lows a similar pattern albeit with a different
conﬁguration  of
In  other
times, as  in  the  Republic  of Korea  and

Growth, equity, and poverty reduction in an East Asian giant

Indonesia  presents  an 

illuminating
example  of the  long-term  interactions
of the three basic themes of this report

on equity and development:

• The 

importance  of market-driven
processes  in  determining  the  distribu-
tion of opportunities and incomes.

• The  role  of political  processes, and  the
engagement  of
these
processes,
in  determining  the  policy

mulation.

the  poor 

in 

• The  overriding  dominance  of institu-
tions in determining the long-run con-
ditions  of governance  for  markets  and
politics to operate.

These  complex  interactions  require  long
periods  of developmental  evolution  to
observe and identify.
Indonesia  has 

substantial  variance
across  all  three  of these  themes. There  is
enough  independence  in  the  variance  for
each factor to sort out, if only roughly, what
is  driving  what. In  chapter  6, the  political
dimension of the economic performance of
the Suharto regime was discussed. Here, we
discuss 
the  connections  with  policy
choices.

Because  Indonesia  has  been  so  impor-
tant  to  the  development  profession, it  has
been  studied  for  a  long  time. The  Dutch
exploited the Netherlands East Indies from
the  seventeenth  century  to  early  in  the
twentieth  century. Then, under  political
pressure at home, the Dutch experimented
with an “Ethical Policy” for the colony, and
the poor beneﬁted signiﬁcantly. During the
Great  Depression, World  War  II, and  the
ﬁght  for  Independence,
the  Indonesian
economy deteriorated rapidly, and the poor
suffered  disproportionately. Java  was  the
original home of the “dual economy” ana-
lyzed  by  Boeke  (1946)  and  formalized  by
Lewis (1954). After declaring independence
in  1945, President  Sukarno  eventually  put

“politics  in  command” in  1959  and  pro-
duced  a  ruinous  inﬂation  that  brought
much of the population to near starvation in
the  mid-1960s. It  was  with  just  cause  that
Gunnar  Myrdal  pronounced 
in  Asian
Drama, 1967, that “no economist holds out
any hope for Indonesia.”

Indonesia’s  rapid, pro-poor  growth  for
the 30 years after the fall of Sukarno aston-
ished  the  development  profession  and,
along  with  other  countries  in  East  and
Southeast Asia, Indonesia became the object
of intense analysis.1 In Indonesia, the weak
starting  conditions  signiﬁcantly  inﬂuenced
how the economic planners approached the
task  of linking  growth  to  the  poor. They
designed  a  three-tiered  strategy  for  pro-
poor  growth, which  connected  sound
macroeconomic  policy  to  market  activities
that  were  facilitated  by  progressively  lower
transaction costs. Those policies were linked
to household decisions about labor supply,
agricultural  production, and  investment  in
the nontradable economy.

The extent to which the poor beneﬁted
from  growth  depended  on  the  array  of
assets  they  controlled: their  labor, human
capital, social  capital, and  other  forms  of
capital, including  access  to  credit.2 Appro-
priate  government  policies  also  inﬂuence
those  dimensions, especially  in  health  and
education. The “road to pro-poor growth”
started  from  desperately  poor  economic
conditions, weak institutions, and a decade
of political instability. It seemed that every-
thing  needed  to  be  done  at  once. The  key
was to focus on restarting and then sustain-
ing  rapid  economic  growth, empowering
poor households to enter the market econ-
omy, and  reducing  the  costs  and  risks  of
doing  so  by  investments  to  lower  transac-
tion costs.

The  strategy  worked  for  three  decades:
between 1967 and 1996, income per capita
increased by 5 percent a year. The incomes
of the bottom quintile of the income distri-
bution, all  individuals  below  the  national

poverty line until the 1990s and all still sub-
sisting  on  less  than  $2  a  day, grew  at  the
same  rate  (or  possibly  slightly  faster). The
distribution of household expenditures had
been  remarkably  stable, with  the  overall
Gini  coefﬁcient  staying  within  a  narrow
range  between  0.31  and  0.36.3 Rural
inequality  had  actually  declined  signiﬁ-
cantly since the 1970s, when access to land
allowed  substantial  beneﬁts  to  be  reaped
from  the  green  revolution. By  the  mid-
1980s, the  labor  market  had  become  the
primary  determinant  of income  in  rural
areas.

But when the Asian ﬁnancial crisis hit in
1997  and  President  Suharto  was  forced  to
resign  in  the  face  of widespread  rioting  in
1998, the country was entirely unprepared in
political or institutional terms to cope with
the  rapid  changes  needed  in  corporate  and
public  governance. The  crisis  sharply  low-
ered  inequality, as  urban  real  estate  and
ﬁnancial  markets  collapsed. But  the  dra-
matic reduction in GDP—over 13 percent in
1998  alone—caused  poverty  rates  to  triple.
Only after 2002 did poverty rates return to
the previous lows observed in 1996. By 2004
they still had not returned to the trend rate
of decline disrupted in 1998.

Explaining  these  trends  in  per  capita
incomes and their distribution requires an
understanding  of how  markets, politics,
and  institutions  jointly  shaped  the  rapid,
pro-poor  growth  strategy, its  subsequent
collapse, and  current  efforts  to  revive  it.
Any such explanation is bound to be con-
troversial, and  there  is  no  formal  model
behind the story about to be told.4 But the
story is plausible and anchored in the his-
torical record.

The  story  begins  with  two  concerns  of
the  emerging  Suharto  government  in  the
late 1960s. The ﬁrst was the misery and dis-
content of the rural masses, who had sup-
ported  Sukarno’s  communist  leanings  and
populist  rhetoric. After  a  decade  of active
discrimination  against  their  livelihoods,

rural households were near starvation and
thus an obvious source of opposition unless
the  new  government  could  incorporate
them in its development plans. Second, the
hyperinﬂation  of the  mid-1960s, the  total
disintegration of the market economy, and
the political chaos meant the entire popu-
lation  was  ready  for  a  more  stable  life. A
strategy  that  promised  stability  and  rural
recovery  would  win  wide  support  (as  it
would throughout densely settled East and
Southeast Asia).

This  is  the  message  that  Suharto  deliv-
ered  to  his  technocrats. This  economic
team had engaged Suharto and other senior
military ofﬁcials in economic training exer-
cises  at  the  Military  College. The  tech-
nocrats  were  handed  the  macroeconomic
portfolio  and  told  to  deliver  on  what
became known in Indonesia as the develop-
ment trilogy—growth, equity, and stability.
To many in the political and military arena,
stability meant repressive measures to stiﬂe
dissent, but  to  the  technocrats  it  meant
restraining  inﬂation  (which  they  did  in
spectacular fashion in just three years) and
stabilizing the rice economy, which was still
a  quarter  of GDP  and  providing  half the
average  Indonesian’s  daily  calories. The
institutions built to provide this stability, in
both  macro  terms  and  in  the  food  econ-
omy, became  essential  to  the  Suharto
regime’s success.5

Thirty years of rapid economic growth,
with  equally  rapid  rates  of poverty  reduc-
tion, was  politically  popular  (the  elasticity
of reduction  of
the  headcount  poverty
index with respect to growth in per capita
incomes was about 1.3 during the Suharto
era). Every ﬁve years, the polling results for
parliament were gleaned for signs of disap-
pointment with the development program.
Despite the heavy hand of Golkar, the pres-
ident’s party, real information was ﬂowing
from villages up to the center through these
elections.

Almost  despite  the  intentions  of the
Suharto  regime, political  institutions  were
taking  root  (people  expected  to  vote)  and
these institutions provided feedback to the
policy  approach  of the  government. There
were  other  feedback  mechanisms  as  well,
and the ones that threatened stability were
taken very seriously. After the 1974 riots in
Jakarta  in  reaction  to  the  visibly  widening
income  distribution, especially  in  urban
areas, the  government  responded  brutally

by putting down the riots and imprisoning
the student leaders. Then it mounted a seri-
ous effort to make the economy more equi-
table. The  result, also  stimulated  by  the
world food crisis in 1973–4, was a major shift
in priorities toward rural development and a
speciﬁc  push  toward  increasing  domestic
rice production. Behind this push were the
objectives  of stabilization  and  equity. To
lose control of the rice economy was to lose
control  of what  mattered  to  Indonesian
society.

The restructuring of Indonesia’s develop-
ment approach after 1974, especially the pre-
emptive  devaluation  of the  rupiah  in  1978,
signaled  the  government’s  determination  to
include the poor in the development process.
The stability of the Gini coefﬁcient seen from
the late 1960s to 2004 should not be taken as
the result of market-driven forces in the face
of given technology, but as a conscious gov-
ernment effort, led from the macroeconomic
arena  by  the  technocrats, to  stimulate  pro-
poor growth.6 This effort succeeded in spec-
tacular  fashion  until  the  mid-1990s, when
cronyism  and  the  growing  inﬂuence  of
Suharto’s  children  on  economic  decision
making caused the approach to unravel.

Part  of the  problem  of post-Suharto
governments  has  been  their  need  to  dis-
tance themselves from this record of repres-
sion and cronyism, despite three decades of
pro-poor growth. This tension brought the
failure  of political  and  institutional  devel-
opment during the Suharto era to the fore.
Questions about causality remain, particu-
larly  whether  rapid, pro-poor  growth  can
be  implemented  by  authoritarian  regimes.
Indonesia’s record, along with that of most
of East  and  Southeast  Asia, indicates  that
they  can. But  is  such  growth  sustainable?
And which is more important for managing
long-run, pro-poor growth: good econom-
ics or good institutions?

In  Indonesia, there  was  no “chicken  or
egg” problem. Something had to be done at
once in view of widespread destitution and
political  chaos, and  the  sequencing  was
clear. Rapid, pro-poor  economic  growth
was  imposed  by  an  authoritarian  regime
concerned about its survival. But this same
regime also imposed on itself commitment
mechanisms  to  make  the  growth  process
market friendly to rural households and to
Chinese  capitalists—that  is, both  ends  of
the economic system. Inﬂation was brought
under  control  by  a  law  requiring  the

national  budget  be  balanced  quarter  by
quarter—a  law  Suharto  basically  imposed
on  himself, but  then  touted  to  all  con-
stituents  as  a  rule  the  government  had  to
live under. To build conﬁdence among the
Chinese  business  community, the  govern-
ment  opened  the  capital  account  in  1970
when it uniﬁed the exchange rate. The ﬂow
of foreign exchange to and from Singapore
and Hong Kong was a sensitive barometer
of the investment climate.

Thus  the  two  constraints  on  the  presi-
dency, which  Suharto  felt  personally  and
used  as  motivation  for  his  bureaucracy  and
government (not the same thing in Indone-
sia), were the need for rural areas to partici-
pate  in  growth, and  the  need  to  keep  the
investment  climate  highly  favorable  for
Suharto’s business partners. The response to
both constraints was an economic package—
low  inﬂation, food  price  stability, an  open
economy, and massive investments in rural
infrastructure—that  generated  rapid  pro-
poor  growth. But  another  part  of
the
investment  climate, a  part  only  for  those
favored  business  partners, involved  special
licenses,
trade  protection, and  lucrative
access  to  domestic  markets. This  part
unraveled the “open economy” part of the
growth package.

The  Suharto  legacy, despite  the  deep
commitment  to  pro-poor  growth, did  not
build  the  groundwork  for  a  political  and
institutional  framework  that  would  ulti-
mately support it. A deep tension developed
between  the  institutional  framework  to
keep  the  open  economy  functioning  efﬁ-
ciently and the political controls to keep the
cronies’ businesses proﬁtable. Without polit-
ical feedback about these very same political
controls, the regime was blindsided by the
ferocity  of the  opposition  to  its  manage-
ment  of
the  Asian  ﬁnancial  crisis. The
depth  of the  crisis, both  economic  and
political, reﬂected  the  vacuum  of institu-
tions  in  place  to  cope  with  an  alternative
political system.

The climb out of the chaos of 1998 mir-
rors  that  from  the  1965  era, but  this  time
without  order  imposed  from  above. The
eagerness and skill with which the Indone-
sian  population  has  participated  in  the
democratic process suggests that social and
political order will now be far more sustain-
able. The  challenge  now  is  to  translate  the
same  democratic  process  into  rapid  and
sustainable pro-poor economic growth.

Leveling the economic 
and political playing ﬁelds

IIIP A R T

WHAT CAN BE DONE TO INCREASE EQUITY IN THE WORLD? Can this be
done in ways that also spur long-term prosperity? We read in part I that
there are large inequalities of opportunity between people within coun-
tries  and—even  more—between  people  in  different  countries. These
inequalities  are  perpetuated  through  interlocking  economic, political,
and  sociocultural  mechanisms, creating  inequality  traps. Individuals
from different groups and countries face a highly uneven playing ﬁeld,
both in their capacities to acquire endowments and aspire to a better life,
and  in  their  opportunities  to  reap  returns  from  those  endowments
through market and nonmarket processes. Because differences between
countries  often  exceed  within-country  differences, it  is  of particular
importance that national policies support, or are at least consistent with,
the narrowing of international differences, notably through the growth
process.

We argued in part II that many inequalities not only violate peo-
ple’s concern for fairness, but actually have costs for the development
process. The  effects  on  development  depend  on  speciﬁc  forms  of
inequality and their interactions with market imperfections and insti-
tutions. Unequal opportunities are associated with inefﬁciencies and
wasted economic potential. Pronounced inequalities in the distribu-
tion of power are often associated with weak economic institutions,
undermining the investment and innovation that is central to long-
run growth. Greater equity is thus not only intrinsically desirable but
also is complementary to long-run growth and prosperity. For poorer
and excluded groups, a focus on equity can bring a double beneﬁt—a
bigger pie and a greater share.

But  the  scope  for  such  a  complementary  relationship  between
equity and aggregate development is often not exploited. When exam-
ining  this, we  suggest  there  are  two  kinds  of pathology  in  policy

130

WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2006

design. First, there is  the  pathology  associ-
ated  with  oligarchic  dominance—institu-
tions and policies that further the interest of
elites  but  not  those  of the  whole  society.
This  may  take  the  form  of extreme  preda-
tion  and  high-level  corruption, as 
in
Mobutu’s  Zaire  or  Haiti  under  the  Duva-
liers. Or it may take the form of enmeshed
alliances  between  economic  and  political
elites  that  favor  rent-seeking, as  in  the
Philippines under Marcos, in much of Latin
America in past decades, and in more subtle
forms in many countries of the world.

Second, there is a more complex pathol-
ogy of policies pursued with the intent, or in
the name, of equity that have high efﬁciency
costs  or  perverse  effects. Communist  eco-
nomic  policy  was  disastrous  for  efﬁciency,
even  while  many  communist  societies  did
much 
in  social  provisioning. Directed
credit—in India, for example—was intended
for the poor (and reached some of the poor),
but  proved  a  high-cost  strategy. Populist
macropolicy  is  always  bad  for  growth, and
almost  always  bad  for  equity  sooner  or
later—witness Argentina during much of the
second  half of the  twentieth  century. Per-
verse  or  growth-sapping  effects  of policies
under  this  pathology  can  be  caused  by
adverse  consequences  for  incentives, unaf-
fordable ﬁscal burdens, or the capture of the
beneﬁts, often  by  middle  groups, which
“hoard  opportunities” at  a  cost  for  other
groups and the overall growth process.

What  can  be  done?  At  a  fundamental
level, the analysis underscores the centrality
of shifting to a state that is more account-
able, has  checks  on  predatory  behavior  of
political  and  economic  elites, is  responsive
to all citizens—especially from middle and
poorer  groups—and  has  effective  conﬂict
management  mechanisms. In  part  II, we
sketched  cases  of transitions  in  this  direc-
tion from history and contemporary expe-
riences, and at the local level. The emphasis
in the development community on issues of
governance  and  empowerment  is  entirely
consistent with this perspective.

While  such  overall  shifts  are  central  to
development, the  World  Bank  has  neither
the mandate nor the comparative advantage
to discuss speciﬁcs of the design of political

institutions (even though action to support
empowerment  of the  poor  is  now  empha-
sized in the design of speciﬁc policies—see
Narayan 2002). In part III, we focus on a set
of areas that do lie squarely in the arena of
development analysis and practice—in poli-
cies affecting the sectors, markets, and in the
global  arena. This  recognizes  the  inﬂuence
of the  political  and  sociocultural  context,
but focuses rather on what an equity prism,
based on the analysis of parts I and II, has to
say about the policy design to break inequal-
ity traps and support aggregate growth The
lesson from part II is that this implies paying
attention  to  speciﬁc inequalities  and  their
interactions  with  markets, social  structure,
and power. This involves both issues of tech-
nical  design  and  mechanisms  that  provide
the  political  underpinnings  for  change,
notably  through  broader  accountability,
coalitions  for  change, or  compensation  of
losers. And while an overarching message is
of the  potential  complementarity  between
greater  equity  and  long-run  prosperity,
there will often be tradeoffs in speciﬁc areas
and  context. One  cross-cutting  area  con-
cerns the need to raise taxes to ﬁnance desir-
able  public  spending. The  design  of tax
instruments is of great importance to mini-
mize  adverse  efﬁciency  effects, while  also
promoting equity where feasible.

We organize the discussion of domestic
action into three areas. First is building and
protecting  people’s  human  capacities—
from the start of people’s lives and through
adulthood  and  old  age. Here  we  focus  on
equalizing from the bottom up—equalizing
up the opportunities of the least advantaged
in terms of skills, health, and risk manage-
ment. There  are  certainly  issues  of equity
among  more  advantaged  groups, but  we
give  priority  to  the  disadvantaged  (in  part
for  reasons  of space). As  seen  in  part  II,
there  are  major  market  imperfections  in
human  capital  formation  and  insurance
that  affect  poor  or  lower-status  groups
most, yet political action has also often been
biased against these groups.

Second is ensuring equitable access to jus-
tice  and  complementary  assets. A  fair  and
accessible  justice  system  is  crucial  for  con-
straining the power of the political and eco-

Leveling the economic and political playing ﬁelds

131

nomic  elite, avoiding  discrimination, and
protecting property rights and personal safety
for  all—with  important  implications  for  the
willingness to invest and innovate. Inequitable
access to land and infrastructure—by wealth,
location, or social group—is typical of devel-
oping  societies  and  often  enmeshed  with
political  structures. Policy  design  can  help
shifts to more equitable and often more efﬁ-
cient patterns (chapter 8).

Third is the domain of markets—ﬁnan-
cial, labor, and product—that have a power-
ful  inﬂuence  on  the  returns  to  people’s
endowments. As  chapters  5  and  6  argued,
markets are typically far from ideal, work-
ing  in  noncompetitive  and  discriminatory
ways, whether  because  of intrinsic  market
imperfections, or because power structures
have shaped them to serve the purposes of
those in power. In these areas, and notably
in the case of ﬁnance, a primary concern is
equalizing  down, by  reducing  protecting
privileges of incumbents. Closely related is
the  conduct  of macroeconomic  policy
(chapter 9).

In the global arena, concern remains with
individuals—and the enormous, unjustiﬁed
differences  in  opportunity  that  people  face
through the morally irrelevant fact of coun-
try of birth. The global playing ﬁeld between

nation-states  is  uneven—and  has  uneven
effects on different groups within countries.
There  is  substantial  scope  for  making  the
playing ﬁeld more even. But as in the domes-
tic arena, policy design involves both techni-
cal  questions  (such  as  the  details  of migra-
tion  arrangements  and  the  application  and
design of patent legislation) and the political
underpinnings  of rules  and  institutions  for
global governance. We examine the potential
for change both in the key global markets—
for  labor, products, ideas, and  capital—and
in  the  potential  scope  for  designing  aid  in
ways  that  support  (rather  than  undercut)
domestic  development, and  through  more
effective  and  equitable  management  of the
global commons (chapter 10).

The epilogue links the report’s perspective
on equity to the thinking and agreements that
have evolved in the development community
in the past decade—captured, for example, in
the  Millennium  Declaration  (2000)  and  the
Monterrey Consensus (2002)—as well as the
World  Bank’s  own  strategic  pillars  of an
enabling  investment  climate  and  promoting
empowerment. We argue that an approach to
development  that  is  deeply  informed  by
equity is fundamental to the full integration of
these  frameworks  into  an  effective  develop-
ment strategy.

Expanding  people’s  capabilities  to 
lead
fuller  lives, the  aim  of all  development,
means  investing  in  their  education  and
health and in their ability to manage risks.
But as chapters 5 and 6 discussed, failures in
markets and governments conspire to gen-
erate large inequalities in people’s opportu-
nities  to  build  their  capabilities. Children
from  poorer  families  start  out  life  with
greater  disadvantages  than  their  wealthier
peers, attend  lower-quality  schools, have
less access to health services, and are not as
protected  from  economic  downturns  and
family  crises. By  the  time  they  are  adults,
they are far less equipped to be productive
members  of society. Economic, political,
and sociocultural inequalities fuel such dif-
ferences in life chances, perpetuating them
across generations.

Public  action  can  level  the  playing  ﬁeld
and  broaden  opportunities  by  addressing
inequalities  in  access  to  quality  education,
health  care, and  risk  management. Well-
designed  policies  will  result  in  more  equi-
tably  distributed  opportunities  to  acquire
endowments  and  boost  overall  productiv-
ity. As  potentially  talented  and  productive
individuals gain access to the services from
which they may have been excluded for rea-
sons  that  have  nothing  to  do  with  their
potential, societies  make  gains  through
greater  efﬁciency  and  greater  social  cohe-
sion in the long run.

Still, there are challenges. Programs require
resources, administrative capacity, and politi-
cal  support. This  means  paying  attention  to
the  design  of tax  systems, tailoring  program
intervention to context, and above all building
constituencies for change. We focus on level-
ing  the  playing  ﬁeld  mainly  through  aug-
menting  the  capacities  of those  with  the
fewest opportunities, but we recognize that it
may  be  necessary  to  attack  the  undue  inﬂu-

ence  of the  powerful  and  the  wealthy  to  be
able to shape public policies to beneﬁt the rest
of society. As we have seen, successful transi-
tions are far more likely where the power of
the  excluded  to  inﬂuence  public  action  has
been enhanced.

There are strong complementarities among
the  different  investments  in  people. Better
nourished  children  have  higher  cognitive
abilities. Well-educated  parents, especially
mothers,
invest  more  in  their  children’s
education and health. More educated indi-
viduals  are  likely  to  be  more  resilient  to
shocks. Instruments  to  smooth  consump-
tion  will  spur  people  to  take  on  not  only
higher  risk  but  also  potentially  higher
return activities and prevent them from dis-
investing  in  themselves  (lowering  food
intake, forgoing treatment) or in their chil-
dren (pulling them out of school) in times
of shocks. And  people  with  more  human
capital and better risk management capabil-
ities can reduce the variability and increase
the level of their incomes.

The policies we consider in this chapter
are  particularly  important  in  arresting  the
intergenerational transmission of inequali-
ties. We begin with a review of the rationale
and potential for early childhood develop-
ment  programs. We  next  consider  broader
education and health policies for expanding
access  to  quality  education  and  care, and
ﬁnally  discuss  transfer  policies  that  help
manage risks and provide for efﬁcient and
equity-enhancing redistribution.

Early childhood development:
a better start in life
By the time poorer children in many countries
reach school age, they are at a signiﬁcant dis-
advantage in cognitive and social ability. The

mented substantial differences at six years of
age, related  to  socioeconomic  status  and
parental education. Differences in childhood
cognitive abilities are indeed apparent as early
as 22 months of age. One study in the United
States  shows  that  by  age  three  the  gaps  in
learning, measured by vocabulary, are already
large  among  children  from  different  social
groups  (ﬁgure  7.1).1 Cognitive  learning  is
affected  by  a  child’s  socioeconomic  status
through  health  (malnutrition,
iron  and
micronutrient deﬁciency, parasite infections)
and  the  quality  of the  home  environment,
including care-giving and cognitive stimula-
tion.2 Scientiﬁc  evidence  on  brain  develop-
ment supports this. Recent research ﬁndings
revamp earlier thinking that assumed that the
structure  of the  brain  was  genetically  deter-
mined at birth and point to the determining
inﬂuence of early experiences—from concep-
tion to age six, and particularly the ﬁrst three
years—on  the  architecture  of the  brain  and
capacities in adulthood.3

As  a  child  ages, environmental  effects
appear  to  accumulate. Poor  cognitive  and
social  abilities  are  associated  with  weaker
future  academic  performance  and  lower
adult  economic  and  social  outcomes,
including  poor  health, antisocial  behavior,
and violence.4 These underachieving adults
inﬂuence the cognitive abilities of the next
generation  of children, creating  an  inter-
generational  cycle  of poverty  and  unequal
opportunities.5 Studies  using  internation-
ally  comparable  student  achievement  tests
conﬁrm that socioeconomic background is
the overwhelming determinant of learning
outcomes, with  schools  accounting  for  no
more than 20 percent of the variation in test
performance.6

Beneﬁts of early interventions
Early  interventions  can  substantially  en-
hance  a  child’s  life  chances  and  loosen  the
intergenerational  grip  of poverty  and  in-
equality. In  recent  years, interest  has  ex-
panded  in  early  childhood  development
(ECD)  in  low-  and  middle-income  devel-
oping  countries, paralleling  greater  atten-
tion in developed countries.

Early  childhood  development  programs
comprise  a  range  of
interventions  that
include providing nutritional supplements to

children, regularly monitoring their growth,
stimulating the development of their cogni-
tive  and  social  skills  through  more  frequent
and  structured  interactions  with  a  caring
adult, and  improving  the  parenting  skills  of
caretakers. The  evidence  suggests  that  these
programs can be highly effective in address-
ing  problems  experienced  later  in  schooling
and adulthood.

for  children 

improvements 

A recent study in the United States shows
that  investments  in  the  early  years  of life,
before children reach the formal school sys-
tem, give  greater  returns  than  later  invest-
ments  (ﬁgure  7.2).7 Well-designed  longi-
tudinal  studies—mainly  from  developed
countries—indicate that programs typically
register 
in
health, cognitive ability, academic perform-
ance, and  tenure  within  the  school  system
and, later  in  life, higher  incomes, higher
incidence of home ownership, lower propen-
sity  to  be  on  welfare, and  lower  rates  of
incarceration  and  arrest.8 This  suggests  a
strong  productivity  case  for  investing  in
early  childhood  development;
the  argu-
ments for public subsidies to disadvantaged
families are compelling on both productiv-
ity and equity grounds. As Heckman argues,

early interventions in children from disadvan-
taged environments raise no efﬁciency-equity
trade-offs; they raise the productivity of indi-
viduals, the workforce and society at large, and
reduce lifetime inequality by helping to elimi-
nate the factor of accident of birth.9

Studies of ECD programs in developing
countries  also  document  strong  benefits

There is sufﬁcient evidence from studies
throughout the world to make a case for
placing early childhood education among
the key interventions to achieve the educa-
tion Millennium Development Goals
(MDGs).

Higher school enrollment. Colombia’s

ECD program PROMESA reports
signiﬁcantly higher enrollment rates in pri-
mary school for children participating in the
program, compared with children not par-
ticipating. ECD programs in India (Haryana)
and Guatemala resulted in a signiﬁcant
decline in enrollment age for girls.

Less grade repetition. In Colombia’s

PROMESA program, the Alagoas and Fort-
aleza PROAPE study of Northeast Brazil and
the Argentina ECD study, children who par-
ticipated in the programs repeated fewer
grades and progressed better through
school than did nonparticipants in similar
circumstances.

Fewer dropouts. In India’s Integrated
Child Development Services program in
Dalmau, attendance of children ages six to
eight in primary school increased by 16 per-
cent for children who had participated in
the program; dropout rates did not change

signiﬁcantly for children from the higher
caste, but fell a dramatic 46 percent for the
lower caste and an astonishing 80 percent
for the middle-caste students. In Colombia
the third-grade enrollment rates for
children who participated in the PROMESA
program increased by 100 percent, reﬂect-

In addition, 60 percent of the children who
participated in the ECD program attained

percent of the comparison group.

for all children, with cost-benefit analyses
showing  returns  of $2–5  for  every  $1  in-
vested. For  example, preliminary  results
for experimental nutritional interventions
at 6 to 24 months of age in rural Guatemala
show that consuming a nutritional supple-
ment  increased  the  probability  of attend-

ing school by 5.6 percentage points and led
to  higher  completed  schooling  attainment
and higher adult cognitive achievement test
scores.

Evidence is also mounting that interven-
tions in early childhood particularly beneﬁt
poor and disadvantaged children and fami-
lies.10 In  Jamaica, nutritional  supplementa-
tion and stimulation administered to under-
nourished children between the ages of 9 to
24  months—who  are  most  likely  to  come
from  disadvantaged 
families—improved
their  mental  development.11 Malnourished
children  who  received  a  milk  supplement
developed more than those who did not (ﬁg-
ure 7.3). Children who beneﬁted from stim-
ulation did even better, while the beneﬁts of
supplements  and  stimulation  were  additive
and allowed disadvantaged children exposed
to them to almost catch up with the develop-
ment trajectory of “normal” children over a
period of 18 months. The results suggest that
ECD programs may be one of the most cost-
effective  avenues  for  reaching  the  Millen-
nium Development Goals for universal edu-
cation and an important contributor to the
attainment of gender parity in primary com-
pletion  (box  7.1). They  also  help  mothers
participate in the labor force—poor women
who had access to free child care in the fave-
las of Rio de Janeiro increased their income
by as much as 20 percent—and improve the
academic performance of older children, as
documented for a community nursery pro-
gram in rural Colombia.12

Designing ECD programs
Interventions  to  improve  young  children’s
capacity to develop and learn can focus on
improving parents’ teaching and child care
skills, delivering  services  directly  to  chil-
dren, or improving child care services in a
community. Programs  may  be  established
in  homes, day-care  centers, or  communi-
ties. The evidence suggests that three design
features  are  important  for  the  full  realiza-
tion of beneﬁts from ECD programs: start-
ing  early, having  strong  parental  involve-
ment,
focusing  on  child  health
(especially  nutrition)  and  cognitive  and
social  stimulation. The  focus  on  health
leads to a virtuous cycle, because improved
health  also  helps  increase  cognitive  and

social  abilities.13 Overly  formal  programs
can be too expensive for poor families, cul-
turally  irrelevant, and  insensitive  to  fami-
lies’ needs.14 They thus run the risk of being
abandoned  even  when  they  demonstrate
high returns.

What  then  are  the  impediments  to  the
widespread  implementation  of ECD  pro-
grams given that they are such good invest-
ments?  Political  economy  constraints  arise
from  the  difﬁculty  of making  a  case  for
spending  resources  on  a  program  with  the
promise of (uncertain) beneﬁts to come only
years in the future. Such a case is often made
by  the  immediate  beneﬁciaries  (parents  of
school-age children) or intermediate beneﬁ-
ciaries  (teachers), who  organize  themselves
into powerful political forces. But the institu-
tional  setup  for  ECD  program  delivery—
with  funds  in  many  instances  channeled 
to  myriad  small  NGOs, community  cen-
ters, or  home-based  caregivers—and  the
absence  of strong  central  responsibility
inhibit  organized  political  pressure. The
same  institutional  setup  generates  prob-
lems of integration with other government
programs  and  of coordination  across  sev-
eral government departments.15

Thinking  about  the  politics  and  the
design of ECD from the start is thus impor-
tant. Getting  information  to  parents, com-
munity leaders, and policymakers about the
objectives  and  efﬁcacy  of ECD  services  can
build  public  awareness  and  strengthen
demand. Monitoring systems build support
by providing timely feedback on a range of
intermediate  outputs  to  policymakers  and
program managers, while proper evaluations
provide more convincing evidence of impact
and  broader  lessons  from  interventions.
Integrating ECD programs into the broader
development frameworks and involving par-
ents,
families, and  community  members
enhance the sustainability of programs.16

There  are  two  possible  approaches  to
scaling up ECD interventions. The ﬁrst is to
expand  publicly  funded  preschool  pro-
grams to all children by making it a statu-
tory right, as in several European countries.
This would have signiﬁcant funding impli-
cations, but the beneﬁt is potentially wide-
spread support from middle-class and poor
families with children.

The second approach would target disad-
vantaged  families. This  may  be  more  cost-
effective  in  view  of the  evidence  presented
earlier on larger gains from interventions for
disadvantaged  children. To  bolster  partici-
pation, the program could be supplemented
by  a  cash-transfer  scheme, with  transfers
conditioned on various desirable behaviors,
including changes in the homecare environ-
ment, as well as regular health center visits
for growth monitoring, immunizations, and
nutrition  interventions.17 This  would  con-
centrate  even  more  resources  on  the  poor,
but  the  political  economy  implications  are
less  clear. While  targeted  programs  have  a
smaller  constituency  and  thus  would  not
beneﬁt from a broad coalition of support, a
national program, with transparent criteria
for eligibility and good monitoring of “con-
ditionality,” could mobilize support not only
from  the  direct  beneﬁciaries  but  also  from
other stakeholders in society.

It is possible to combine a universal pre-
school  approach  with  a  conditional  cash
transfer  (CCT)  program. This  would  yield
the  highest  beneﬁts  in  the  participation  of
the poor and the productivity gains for all,
but  it  would  also  be  more  costly. The
approach  adopted  in  any  country  setting
will have to emerge from considerations of
costs, beneﬁts, and  ﬁscal  capacity—and
reﬂect the political economy.

Basic education: expanding
opportunities to learn
Prominent in the Millennium Development
Goals, education  is  a  great  equalizer  of
opportunities  between  rich  and  poor  and
between men and women. But the equaliz-
ing  promise  of education  can  be  realized
only if children from different backgrounds
have  equal  opportunities  to  beneﬁt  from
quality  education. In  the  previous  section,
we  argued  that  children’s  ability  to  beneﬁt
from  school  is  strongly  inﬂuenced  by  the
cognitive  and  social  skills  they  acquire  in
their early years. Evidence suggests that the
gains from early interventions can dissipate
if disadvantaged  children  go  on  to  low-
quality primary schools.18

Chapter 2 documented the large inequali-
ties  in  educational  attainment  within  coun-
tries by income, region, gender, and ethnicity.

136

WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2006

Chapter  5  presented  the  economic  reasons
why credit-constrained households underin-
vest in education, making the efﬁciency case
for subsidizing education for the poor. There
are other reasons for parents to choose a level
of education  for  their  children  that  may  be
lower than what is optimal for the child and
for society. Educational attainment has vari-
ous  societal  beneﬁts  that  are  not  fully  cap-
tured  by  the  individual. For  example, it  is
generally  associated  with  enhanced  democ-
racy and lower crime, while girls’ schooling in
particular has been shown to reduce fertility,
empower women, and thereby contribute to
the welfare of children in the family. In addi-
tion, education  has  intrinsic  value, enabling
people  to  lead  fuller  lives  as  informed  and
active participants in society.

The case for moving to equalizing access
to  education  is  therefore  strong  on  both
equity  and  efﬁciency  grounds, especially  for
basic  education. Beyond  basic  education,
there is an important efﬁciency rationale for
ensuring that the most talented and produc-
tive  people  in  society  have  access  to  higher
education. In  today’s  globalized  world, with
competition largely on the basis of skills and
ideas, countries need to cultivate latent talent,
wherever  it  may  reside. Motivated  and  tal-
ented  children  from  poorer  households
deserve the opportunity to excel as much as
their wealthier peers. While we acknowledge
the  important  equity  dimension  of policies
for tertiary education, the discussion here is
devoted  primarily  to  policies  that  expand
access to and quality of basic education.

We  argue  that  there  is  a  case  for  public
action to enhance equity in learning so that
outcomes  reﬂect  not  merely  circumstances 
of luck—parental endowments, sociocultural
environment, birth  place, one  dedicated
teacher—but  genuine  differences  in  prefer-
ences, effort, and  talent  consistent  with  the
notion of equal opportunities. This requires
expanding  affordable  access  and  upgrading
quality, with  a  particular  focus  on  excluded
groups, through  various  interventions  that
increase both the demand for schooling and
the capacity and incentives of the school sys-
tem to respond.

There are clear complementarities in this
approach: quality improvements help only if
children are in school, but they also inﬂuence

the  probability  of their  attendance. Even
uneducated  parents  will  pull  their  children
out  of school  if they  perceive  low  quality.19
There may be tradeoffs, however, if resources
devoted to upgrading quality beneﬁt prima-
rily the privileged who are already in school
at  the  expense  of reaching  excluded  groups
or areas—or if the rapid expansion of access
reduces the quality of instruction. While the
long-run  objective 
for  school  systems
around the world is clear, priorities will vary
by country, region, or group.

Expanding access, particularly 
for excluded groups
Expanding  access  for  all. More  than  100
million children of primary school age are
out  of school, either  because  they  never
entered the system or because they dropped
out before ﬁnishing.20 As a result, some 52
countries risk not reaching the goal of uni-
versal primary completion.21 In most coun-
tries, improving opportunities in education
means ensuring affordable access, especially
for  poor  rural  children  and  disadvantaged
groups.

Higher public spending on the supply of
schools is one way to expand access. Analy-
sis  of the  determinants  of school  enroll-
ment  in  various  countries  suggests  that
proximity  to  schools  is  a  major  factor.22 A
careful  evaluation  of
Indonesia’s  school
construction  program  in  the  1970s, the
largest  such  program  on  record, ﬁnds  evi-
dence of signiﬁcant increases in both edu-
cation  and  earnings.23 The  program  yields
large positive returns, but it takes more than
30 years to do so because upfront construc-
tion costs are high (more than 2 percent of
Indonesia’s GDP in 1973), while the bene-
ﬁts are spread over a generation’s lifetime.

But for every success story there are many
others  in  which  higher  spending  has  not
translated into better access to infrastructure,
inputs, and instruction for children. In many
cases, the resources are not used effectively—
too  much  is  spent  on  teacher  salaries  or
reducing  class  size  and  not  enough  is  spent
on instructional materials.

Incidence  studies  suggest  that  the  poor
stand to beneﬁt more from expansion when
mean levels of access to services are already
reasonably  high, now  the  case  for  primary

schooling, even in many low-income coun-
tries. But  spending  alone  is  clearly  not
enough  to  get  the  children  in  school  (and
even  less  effective  in  ensuring  that  they
learn). In  many  countries, the  main  prob-
lem  is  not  facilities  but  children  dropping
out  or  not  attending  available  schools.24
Recent efforts to boost access thus focus on
demand-side  interventions: reducing  the
cost  of schooling  or  providing  incentives,
even paying for attendance.

In many countries, parents have to pay a
lot, either for school fees or for other inputs,
such as uniforms and textbooks. Eliminat-
ing these costs can boost participation. Free
uniforms  and  textbooks  provided  by  an
NGO program in Kenya (along with better
classrooms) reduced dropout rates consid-
erably: after ﬁve years, students in the pro-
gram  completed  about  15  percent  more
schooling. In addition many students from
nearby  schools  transferred  to  program
schools  to  take  advantage  of the  beneﬁts.
The result was a 50 percent increase in class
size—an  increase  that  does  not  appear  to
have  deterred  parents  nor  has  it  led  to  a
measurable negative impact on test scores.
This is at least suggestive that a reallocation
of the  education  budget—larger  class  size
with the savings used to pay for the inputs
under  the  program—could  raise  school
participation at no cost to quality.25

Eliminating  user  fees  for  basic  schools
has  also  been  shown  to  boost  student
enrollment, but  quality  may  be  compro-
mised  if
reliable  alternative  sources  of
ﬁnancing are not available to schools (box
7.2). In  both  Tanzania  and  Uganda, elimi-
nating  school  fees  became  an  important
political  issue  when  the  population  could
voice  its  discontent, helped  by  the  demo-
cratic process, an active civil society, and (in
Tanzania)  the  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy
Paper process.

In some cases, there may be a need to go
beyond  removing  the  direct  ﬁnancial  costs
of schooling to induce poor parents to enroll
their  children. This  could  be  accomplished
by providing CCTs and free meals. CCT pro-
grams make payments to poor families, typ-
ically  mothers, on  the  condition  that  chil-
dren attend school regularly. The programs
can be seen as compensating for the oppor-

B O X   7 . 2 School fees—an instrument of exclusion 

or accountability?

There are two schools of thought about
school fees. Some claim that school fees
deter poor families from sending their kids
to school. Even nominally small amounts can
be a large share of poor households’ income,
and these come on top of the forgone bene-
ﬁts of children contributing to family busi-
ness or household chores. Schooling costs
often ﬁgure in parents’ responses about con-
straint to enrollment, and eliminating school
fees appears to have spurred a large
increase in enrollments in a number of
countries, including Kenya,Tanzania,
Uganda, and Vietnam. Others see user fees
as an important accountability tool, a mech-
anism for empowering parents to demand

quality services from the schools, and point
to studies that show even poor households’
willingness to pay for good quality services.
Sympathetic to the arguments in favor

of greater accountability, we argue for elimi-
nating user fees when the ﬁscal impact of
forgone revenues can be managed without
large efﬁciency costs or harmful spending
cuts.The desirable voice and accountability
aspects of school fees can be harnessed
equally or better through contributing
labor for school improvements or working
on parent-teacher advisory committees.
Such in-kind fees are cheaper to the parent
and engage the parent more fully in school
decision making.

tunity  cost  of schooling  for  poor  families
and  represent  one  approach  to  addressing
failures in credit markets and the imperfect
agency  of parents. Many  of the  cash-for-
school-attendance  programs  are  large, rep-
resenting signiﬁcant commitments of public
resources. The  biggest  are  Oportunidades
(previously  PROGRESA)  in  Mexico, the
Bolsa Escola in Brazil, and the Food for Edu-
cation Program in Bangladesh.26

The budgets allocated to these programs
are  between  just  under  1  percent  of total
government  current  expenditure  in  Brazil
and  more  than  5  percent  in  Bangladesh.
These signiﬁcant, but not prohibitive, sums
could  be  generated  from  savings  on  other
expenditures, such  as  regressive  subsidies
for  public  services, including  tertiary  edu-
cation. A question remains about how cost-
effective  the  programs  are  in  expanding
education: the answer depends on how suc-
cessful they are in reaching households that
would  not  have  participated  in  the  school
system without the transfers.

A  careful  evaluation  of PROGRESA
found an average increase in enrollment of
3.4  percent  for  all  students  in  grades  one
through  eight, with  the  largest  increase
(14.8 percent) for girls who had completed
grade six.27 Morley and Coady (2003) esti-
mate an internal rate of return (taking into
account the cost of grants) for the program
of 8  percent  a  year  and  report  that  the
transfers  are  10  times  more  cost-effective

138

than  building  schools. But  De  Janvry  and
Sadoulet  (2004)  ﬁnd  that  most  program
beneﬁts  are  received  by  those  who  would
have  gone  to  school  anyway. They  suggest
calibrating  transfers  to  increase  program
efﬁciency—for  example,
larger
transfers to the eldest child, to children with
an  indigenous  father, or  to  children, espe-
cially girls, living in villages without a sec-
ondary school.

Reaching  excluded  groups. Schools  with
adequate  supplies  and  well-trained  and

everyone. But  additional  support  may  be
necessary  to  improve  access  for  excluded
groups, such as disabled children, girls, and
indigenous groups.

Including disabled children is possible at
relatively  modest  costs. In  Uruguay, grants
of up to $3,000 are awarded for schools that

B O X   7 . 3 Desegregating Roma schools in Bulgaria: 

the Vidin model

In Vidin, the Open Society Institute and the
Roma NGO known by the initials DROM
have been collaborating to integrate Roma
students into the mainstream school
system.Vidin is a town of 85,000 in north-
west Bulgaria, and 6 percent of its popula-
tion was identiﬁed as Roma in the 1992 cen-
sus. In the 2000–01 school year, 460 Roma
students, or half the school-age students,
were enrolled in the mainstream school sys-
tem. Students are bused from the
settlement to school and back. And Roma
monitors interact with parents and the
school to encourage attendance. Low-
income students also receive shoes and
school lunches, with lunches given on the
bus to reduce the stigma of receiving it at
school.

While preparing the program, DROM

went door-to-door in the Roma settlement
and sought the support of the schools, the
mayor, and the media.The project eventu-
ally gained the support of all the stakehold-
ers except the mayor, who nevertheless
agreed not to block it. DROM invited the six
mainstream schools in Vidin to present the
program, philosophy, and teachers on tele-
vision. Roma parents then selected a school
for their children.This marked the ﬁrst time
that their views had been solicited by the
authorities.

At the end of the ﬁrst semester, atten-

dance was 100 percent, and ﬁrst-term ﬁnal-
grade averages were identical to those of
non-Roma pupils. Parents and teachers
were satisﬁed, especially with the absence
of reported incidents of anti-Roma
prejudice. Education authorities were
encouraged to scale up in other cities. In
addition, 35 Roma parents of the bused chil-
dren returned to school in adult education
programs, and three teenagers who had
dropped out in the third grade asked to join
the program, prompting teachers to work
extra hours with them. On the negative side,
24 pupils received failing grades in one or
more subjects, and three left the program.

The success is attributable to three

major factors. First, parents feel that their
children are protected from prejudice
because they are bused and monitored
throughout the day by adult Roma. Second,
Roma monitors in the schools assure that
the children are not mistreated, encourage
parental engagement and student partici-
pation in extracurricular activities, and help
the teachers ease cultural differences.Third,
the children are happy to be in schools
where real learning takes place.

put forward proposals for reaching disabled
children. In the two years since the fund was
set up, 6 percent of all schools in Uruguay
have been awarded grants to cover expenses
to  adapt  school  materials, equipment, and
infrastructure  and  to  train  teachers  in
appropriate pedagogical approaches.

Improving  gender  equity  in  access  to
schooling  often  requires  making  special
provisions for girls, especially older girls.28
Speciﬁc grants for girls have been effective
in Bangladesh and Mexico. Private latrines
for  girls  are  essential. Other  structural
improvements  including  boundary  walls,
ﬂexible  or  double  sessions  when  sharing  a
facility with boys, and perhaps even gender-
speciﬁc schools may allay parents’ concerns
about girls’ privacy and safety. It is impor-
tant  for  schools  to  undermine, not  under-
score, stereotypes and unequal treatment of
women—and  to  be  wary  of giving  boys
more  resources, leadership, and  attention.
Female  teachers  are  good  role  models  for
boys and girls, and even young women can
be effective teachers with training, support,
and  a  programmed  curriculum. Govern-
ments might consider setting national goals
for  hiring  women  and  being  ﬂexible  with
age and education requirements for female
teachers (while still providing adequate in-
service training).29

To expand access for ethnic groups, teach-
ers  or  teacher  aides  from  the  target  ethnic
group are particularly helpful in their ability
to connect with the students as powerful role
models. Bilingual  schools  have  also  been
effective. In  Mali, bilingual  programs  were
associated with large declines in dropout and
repetition, and  rural  students  outscored
urban children. In Mexico, geographic target-
ing under PROGRESA (now Oportunidades)
led  to  the  relatively  high  participation  of
indigenous people (but not those in the most
remote areas without schools).30 An innova-
tive approach to encourage the attendance of
Roma children in Vidin, Bulgaria, appears to
have paid off (box 7.3).

Upgrading quality
Better  quality  for  all. Expanding  access  to

income  countries  do  a  lot  worse  than  the
average OECD kid on international tests of
learning achievement, suggesting that much
of the learning in schools does not prepare
children  to  be  productive  adults, let  alone
for the rigors of competition they will face
in  the  global  labor  market.31 The  quality
deﬁcit  is  undoubtedly  greater  for  children
from poorer families, because the better-off
children can go to better public schools or
leave the public system and opt for private
schooling.

Based  on  the  results  of a  standardized
international  achievement  test—the  Third
International Mathematics and Science Study
(TIMSS)—Pritchett  (2004a)  estimates  that
the  overwhelming  majority  of children  ages
15  to  19  lacks  education  (not  completing
grade  nine  or  performing  poorly  in  the
TIMSS)  in  ﬁve  middle-income  countries
with data (ﬁgure 7.4).32  But the enrollment
problem  remains  large  only  in  Morocco.
Indonesia and Turkey have difﬁculty retain-
ing  kids  in  secondary  school; in  Colombia,

have failed to learn enough.

student  performance  on 

How can countries improve basic learning
outcomes  for  all?  We  know  broadly  from  a
large  number  of studies  that  have  tried  to
account  for  the  “production” of schooling
outcomes  that  higher  public  spending  does
not always translate into better student learn-
ing.33 A  recent  study  analyzing  the  determi-
nants  of
the
TIMSS—using  data  for  more  than  260,000
students from 6,000 schools in 39 countries—
ﬁnds that education spending (spending per
student, class  size, student-teacher  ratio)  at
either the school or country level has no posi-
tive impact on student performance. Among
factors at the school level, the only ones that
have a signiﬁcant impact on student perform-
ance  are  instructional  material  and  teachers
with an adequate formal education.34

These  results  are  conﬁrmed  by  several
careful  microlevel  studies. Since  1996, a
group of researchers working with a Dutch
NGO, International  Chirstelijk  Steunfonds
Africa, has been involved in the design and
evaluation of a series of randomized exper-
iments to improve learning outcomes in the
Busia  district  in  rural  Kenya. The  results

books  helps  improve  test  scores, but  only
among the better-performing students, and
that performance-based prizes for teachers
increased test scores initially, but the gains
dissipated  later. What  did  work  in  raising
test  scores  were  merit  scholarships  for  13-
to  15-year-old  girls—with  positive  effects
also on learning for boys, who were ineligi-
ble, and  girls  with  low  pretest  scores, who
were  unlikely  to  win  the  scholarships. The
scholarships were the most cost-effective of
all  the  interventions  tested, achieving  the
same learning results at less than 20 percent
of the cost of textbook provision.35

The results underscore the importance of
combining additional spending (of the right
kind)  with  interventions  that  strengthen
incentives to teach and to learn. As the teacher
incentive program shows, project design—in

B O X   7 . 4 Remedying education: 

the Balsakhi program in India

The Balsakhi program is a large remedial
education program now implemented in 20
Indian cities by an NGO—Pratham—in col-
laboration with the government. Pratham
hires young women from the community to
teach basic literacy and numeracy skills to
children who reach the third or fourth
grade without having mastered them. Stu-
dents are pulled out of regular classes for
two hours of the school day for the reme-
dial education.The program is inexpensive:
$5 per child per year. Easily replicable, it has
been scaled up rapidly since its inception in
Mumbai in 1994, now reaching tens of
thousands of students in the 20 cities.

A recent two-year randomized evalua-

program has highly signiﬁcant positive
results on student learning. On average, the
program increased learning by 0.15
standard deviations in the ﬁrst year and
0.25 in the second year.The gains were
largest for children at the bottom of the dis-
tribution, with those in the bottom third
gaining 0.20 deviations in the ﬁrst year, and
0.32 in the second year (0.51 for math
alone).The results were similar in the two
grade levels and in the two cities. At the
margin, extending this program would be

level. What about improving learning out-
comes  for  disadvantaged  or  poorly  per-
forming  students?  The  merit  scholarship
program  for  13-  to  15-year-old  girls  in
rural Kenya mentioned earlier is one such
example. The Balsakhi program in India—
a large remedial education program—rep-
resents another highly successful and cost-
effective  approach 
to  giving  poorly
performing  students  a  leg  up  (box  7.4).
Because  children  with  the  lowest  ability
registered  the  largest  gains  in  test  scores,
the  program  had  an  equalizing  effect  on
student achievement.

Many countries group students together
by  similar  abilities  on  efﬁciency  grounds.
However, recent ﬁndings in 18 to 26 coun-
tries show that such tracking increases edu-
cation  inequality, possibly  by  reinforcing
the  effects  of family  background, but  it
does  not  contribute  to  higher  mean  levels
of performance.37

Another option to improve learning out-
comes for disadvantaged children is to pro-
vide  school  vouchers. There  is  signiﬁcant
controversy around the equity and efﬁciency
impacts of generalized voucher schemes (box
7.5). Targeted  means-tested  voucher  pro-
grams  may  be  more  promising.38 Results
from  one  such  scheme  in  Colombia  are
encouraging. The PACES program provided
more  than  125,000  students  from  poor
neighborhoods  with  vouchers  that  covered

about  half the  cost  of private  secondary
schools; vouchers could be renewed as long as
students  maintained  satisfactory  academic
performance. An evaluation of this random-
ized  natural  experiment  (vouchers  were
awarded  by  lottery)  found  lower  repetition
rates and higher test results among voucher
winners.39 But targeted voucher schemes may
be politically difﬁcult to implement—and the
Colombia program was discontinued.

Strengthening accountability
Dismal  learning  outcomes  in  many  coun-
tries  are  due  to  the  combination  of inade-
quate resources and the low responsiveness
and  accountability  of
school  systems.
Efforts to improve school performance will
therefore  need  to  focus  on  strengthening
accountability  processes: achieving  societal
consensus on expanding education, dealing
with capture by vested interests, and tackling
the weak incentives for service providers to
raise the quality of learning.

Achieving societal consensus on expand-
ing  education  helps  tackle  the  pathology  of
elite  capture, whereby  the  wealthy  oppose
increased spending in public education. His-
torically, expansion of voice in a country has
led  to  wider  access  and  quality  improve-
ments in basic education, notably in Europe
and  North  America.43 Democratic  transi-
tions have spurred recent expansions in basic
education  also  in  Brazil, Guatemala, and
Uganda.44 But these are long-term processes,
and  it  is  essential  to  make  progress  now
toward meeting the urgent needs of millions
of children around the world.

Some progress can be made by counter-
ing  the  stranglehold  of interest  groups  on
equity-enhancing  reforms, such  as  when
teachers  unions  block  reforms  that  would
strengthen  the  link  between  performance
and  accountability.45 Signiﬁcant  payoffs 
can  come  from  systemic  reforms  that
strengthen  accountability 
from  clients
directly  to  frontline  providers.46 The  most
crucial  steps  in  any  such  reform  are  to
increase the schools’ accountability for per-
formance  and  to  ensure  the  availability  of
relevant information to monitor their per-
formance. Accountability  for  performance
also  requires  autonomy  to  manage  results.
This  means  delegating  responsibility  and

School vouchers: efﬁcient and equitable?

School voucher programs increase the power of
parents to choose schools for their children. Par-
ents are given a voucher by the government,
which (at least in theory) can be applied to the
school of their choice, public or private.The
expectation is that competition among schools
and the availability of public resources to access
private schools would improve the overall efﬁ-
ciency of the school system and student
achievement. But research into the impacts of
vouchers has not produced deﬁnitive or gener-
alizable results—in large part because of
methodological challenges and the differences
in the speciﬁc design and institutional context
of various reforms. Design can vary according to
the size of the voucher, the pool of eligible stu-
dents, whether schools can charge more than
the value of the voucher, and regulations gov-
erning school choice (such as whether or not
religious schools are eligible). Institutional man-
agement, bureaucratic control, governance of
public schools, and oversight of eligible private
schools also vary and inﬂuence the results of
programs.40

Chile has more than 20 years of experience

with large voucher programs.Yet detailed analy-
sis on the effects of competition on school qual-
ity in Chile has not led to a consensus on
impact. In the United States, one study found
that competition improved achievement in the
city of Milwaukee, while another found no
impact. Similar variance is found in the related
literature on the impact of school choice.41
Competition between schools and school

choice imply that weak public schools will lose
students and could be forced to close. Success-
ful schools would have to be enlarged, or new—
and presumably more effective—schools would
have to be built. Such institutional change pres-
ents signiﬁcant political, technical, and adminis-
trative hurdles.The hurdles are particularly
acute under a universal voucher program that
enables large student migration.

Solid evidence on productivity differences
between public and private schools is also lack-
ing. Again consider Chile, whose voucher pro-
gram generated a large number of new secular
private schools that operated alongside more
established Catholic schools. An analysis of
Chilean fourth-grade achievement data showed
that Catholic schools had higher achievement
than public schools in math and Spanish, while
secular private schools had lower achievement.
Another study found that unrestricted nation-
wide school choice in Chile resulted in middle-
class ﬂight into private schools, but without
achievement gains.42

Evidence on peer effects that could influ-

ence student achievement is equally inconclu-
sive. It is not clear whether peer effects are lin-
ear, meaning that gains for students who move
to a higher-quality peer group are offset by
losses for either their new or old classmates—
or nonlinear, meaning, for instance, that posi-
tive peer effects can disproportionately benefit
students with low socioeconomic status.

While impacts on efﬁciency are ambiguous,

there are reasons to be cautious about the

equity effects of universal voucher programs.
They could lead to increased racial and socioe-
conomic stratiﬁcation of schools as parents seek
to improve the quality of their children’s peers
(such as middle-class ﬂight in Chile). Such strati-
ﬁcation could occur if all parents were given
vouchers but low-income families were in a less
favorable position to exercise choice because of
lack of information, prohibitive transportation
costs, or extra fees. Disadvantaged students
would simply be more concentrated in low-
quality schools. Echoing similar concerns, a
recent study concludes that, in the United
States,“a large-scale universal voucher program
would not generate substantial gains in overall
student achievement and ... it could well be
detrimental to many disadvantaged students”
(Ladd 2002, 4).

There are ways to make voucher programs

more beneﬁcial for disadvantaged students, but
these may reduce political support for such pro-
grams. For instance, vouchers and school choice
can be limited to low-income families. Program
design can also be enhanced by providing
transportation to school, requiring that schools
do not charge extra tuition or fees on top of the
voucher, and requiring oversubscribed schools
to select students randomly. Irrespective of
design speciﬁcs, a voucher program needs to be
embedded in a larger strategy of education
reform that improves the overall institutional
incentive environment for schools and gives
underperforming schools the instruments and
resources to improve.

power  for  decision  making  to  the  lowest
feasible level consistent with incentives.47

Once  the  responsibilities  of the  school
system  are  well  deﬁned, the  resources  and
decision-making  powers  of providers  are
consistent  with  their  responsibilities, and
information  is  available  to  track  perform-
ance, various  mechanisms  become  avail-
able  to  pressure  schools  to  deliver  better
performance. School  autonomy, commu-
nity  control, nongovernment  providers,
voucher  programs, and  public  sector
reforms  can  strengthen  the  ability  of citi-
zens, communities, and  public  organiza-
tions to hold schools accountable for deliv-
ering  results.48 El  Salvador’s  experience
with rebuilding much of its education sys-
tem  following  the  destructive  civil  war  of
the 1980s is a good example of what can be
accomplished  through  partnership  with

local  communities. As  a  result  of greater
parental  involvement, Educo  schools  had
rapid  enrollment  increases  without  giving
up  quality, reduced  absenteeism  among
teachers and students, and increased math
and language scores.

Toward better health for all
The  large  inequalities  in  health  care  use
and  health  outcomes  in  many  developing
countries do not just reﬂect different pref-
erences  or  needs—they  arise  from  con-
straints  on  the  ability  of
individuals  to
achieve good health (chapter 2). Income is
one  important  constraint, especially  given
incomplete ﬁnancial markets. Low-income
people around the world have worse health
and  use  fewer  health  services  (chapter  2).
Ethnicity, race, and  location  also  inﬂuence

142

outcomes. Infant  mortality  rates  among
blacks in South Africa are 5.5 times higher
than  those  among  whites; life  expectancy
among  the  rural  Chinese  is  almost  6  years
lower than among urban dwellers, while the
life expectancy gap between China’s richest
and  poorest  provinces 
(Beijing  and
Guizhou) is 10 years.49

These stark differences in outcomes and
use reﬂect large group-based inequalities in
access  to  information, facilities  with  rea-
sonable  standards  of care  and  ﬁnancial
protection  from  health  risk. A  lack  of
knowledge about hygiene, nutrition, avail-
able  services, and  treatment  options, par-
ticularly  among  the  uneducated,
lowers
demand  for  health  services. Within  the
household, some family members have less
voice  (women  and  children)  and  this  can
affect  the  level  of resources  used  in  their
interest. Health  clinics, especially  in  poor
and  remote  areas, are  often  inaccessible,
have high rates of absenteeism and low qual-
ity and responsiveness to clients. Finally, ill-
ness  is  certainly  a  burden  on  poor  people,
but  catastrophic  health  shocks  can  also
have disastrous consequences for the not so
poor, mainly  through  loss  of income  but
also through high out-of-pocket payments
for health care.

These  large  group  disparities  in  health
outcomes  are  inequitable, because  they
imply vastly different opportunities to lead
productive  lives. And  because  they  often
arise  from  failures  in  markets  and  agency,
reducing these disparities would have large
payoffs  in  efﬁciency  and  productivity. We
focus here on ways to level the playing ﬁeld
for attaining good health by boosting peo-
ple’s knowledge about basic health practices
and  services, expanding  their  access  to

B O X   7 . 6 Working with mothers to treat malaria

Malaria kills nearly 1 million children in
Africa each year. Empowering mothers to
take actions to treat their children in the
home can be highly effective in reducing
mortality.The Tigray region of Ethiopia
trained “mother coordinators,” who were
selected from among the community to
educate other mothers on the symptoms of
fever and malaria. Mothers were provided

chloroquine and information on how to
administer the drug at a cost of $0.08 per
child treatment dose. By educating mothers,
Tigray provided rapid and effective
treatment without forcing the child to relo-
cate, which reduced under-ﬁve mortality by
40 percent and alleviated the burden of
severe malaria cases on hospitals.

affordable care, and enhancing the account-
ability of providers.

Expanding knowledge
Underinvestments  in  health  by  patients
may reﬂect a lack of knowledge and agency
and  incentive  issues  within  the  household,
as well as a lack of these resources. Lack of
knowledge  can  keep  people  from  seeking
care when they need it, even when price is
not  an  issue. As  chapter  5  showed, when
deworming  medicine  was  offered  free  to
children in Kenya, the take-up rate was only
57 percent. Similarly, in Bolivia, many poor
babies are not delivered by a trained atten-
dant  even  though  mothers  are  eligible  for
free  care. In  India, 60  percent  of children
have  not  been  fully  immunized, although
immunization  is  free; mothers  cited  igno-
rance of the beneﬁts of vaccination and not
knowing  the  clinic  locations  as  the  major
reasons for why their children had not been
immunized.

Lack  of knowledge  can  also  lead  people
to pay for inappropriate care. Unqualiﬁed or
unethical providers can overprescribe treat-
ments for patients who do not know what is
in their best interest. For instance, instead of
effective  and  inexpensive  oral  rehydration
therapy, a poor child in Indonesia gets more
than four (often useless) drugs per diarrhea
attack.50

Education is a natural way to address the
lack of patient knowledge. Elo and Preston
(1996) estimate that one year of extra edu-
cation nationally reduces mortality rates by
about  8  percent—half directly  and  half
through  the  effects  of additional  earnings.
Female  education  is  particularly  powerful.
Better-educated mothers are associated with
better child-health practices, including hand
washing, proper disposal of feces, antenatal
care, delivery  assistance  by  trained  person-
nel, immunization, and well-baby clinics.

Community  health  agents  also  provide
cost-effective instruction in disease preven-
tion  and  healthy  behavior. By  employing
these nonspecialized personnel, many coun-
tries  have  increased  knowledge  among  the
general  public  at  low  cost, as  with  Brazil’s
Family  Health  Program  and  Ethiopia’s
“mother  coordinators,” supporting  home-
based  malaria  treatment  (box  7.6). Com-

Human capacities

143

munity  health  workers  have  also  helped
increase coverage of poor populations cost-
effectively.

Public  information  campaigns  can  im-
prove health knowledge by working through
existing health clinics or by directly targeting
the community. It is also possible to collabo-
rate  with  the  private  sector  in  marketing
socially valuable products, such as insecticide-
treated  mosquito  nets, water  puriﬁcation
methods,
foods  rich  in  vitamin  A, and
soap—as with the Central American Hand-
Washing  Initiative  in  Costa  Rica, El  Sal-
vador, and  Guatemala.51 Media  campaigns
can also be effective. For instance, frequent
broadcasts  of AIDS  messages  in  Thailand,
Uganda, and Brazil were a key element in the
campaign  to  reduce  the  spread  of the  dis-
ease. The  Thai  media  campaign  is  credited
with  reducing  the  incidence  of AIDS  to  a
point  at  which  the  country  is  now  able  to
consider a ﬁscally viable treatment program
for AIDS patients.52

But neither information nor free services
may be enough to boost use among the less
empowered  or  those  without  voice. Mater-
nal and child health is often viewed as merit-
ing additional intervention. Through condi-
tional transfers, Mexico’s PROGRESA (now
Oportunidades)  program  was  designed  to
encourage women to attend pre- and post-
natal clinical visits and bring their children
for  immunization  and  growth  monitoring.
The  program  saw  an  8  percent  increase  in
clinic visits by pregnant women in their ﬁrst
trimester, which led to a 25 percent drop in
the incidence of illness in newborns and a 16
percent increase in the annual growth rate of
children between one and three. An impor-
tant design feature of the program is trans-
ferring funds to women. Although the pro-
gram puts more demands on mothers’ time,
participants felt that the beneﬁts were worth
it. Women  also  reported  feeling  more  self-
conﬁdent  and  having  more  control  over
household  resources  and  their  time  and
travel. Similar schemes are delivering mater-
nal and child care services in Brazil, Colom-
bia, and Nicaragua.53

Expanding access
Access  to  quality  health  facilities  remains  a
problem  in  many  areas, often  imposing  a

greater  burden  on  rural  dwellers  through
additional  travel  time  and  hospice  costs.
City  dwellers  are  within  easier  reach  of
health centers. In Burundi, 98 percent of the
urban population was within one hour of a
health  center, but  only  65  percent  of the
rural  population  was. Even  within  rural
areas, there  is  large  variation. Only  half of
the poorest rural Nigerians were within an
hour of a clinic, but 84 percent of the rich-
est were.

Even when health facilities are accessible,
they vary hugely in quality. Some have med-
icines and drugs in stock, are run by well-
trained  and  motivated  staff, and  are  well
maintained. But  many  are  not. They  are
often dilapidated, rarely have medicines in
stock, and  are  run  by  poorly  trained  and
rude  medical  staff, who  frequently  fail  to
come to work. It is often precisely the peo-
ple  who  are  materially  disadvantaged  who
also have to struggle with poor quality and

B O X   7 . 7 Poor people and ethnic minorities 

receive lower-quality care 

New studies from India, Indonesia, Mexico,
and Tanzania demonstrate that the poor sys-
tematically receive lower-quality care from
private and public providers.54 The situation is
often worse for ethnic minorities.Evidence
from Mexico suggests that, even in poor rural
villages, there is a difference in the quality of
care between wealthy and poor and between
indigenous and nonindigenous groups.
Among the poorest ﬁfth of the population in

Mexico, indigenous women receive prenatal
care from doctors who rank only in the
twenty-ﬁfth percentile in quality, while
equally poor nonindigenous women receive
care ranking in the fortieth percentile.The
wealthiest ﬁfth fare much better, but even
among the wealthy, the indigenous receive
worse care than the nonindigenous, suggest-
ing that discriminatory practices or cultural
barriers may be at play (see ﬁgure below).

inaccessible health facilities. Ethnic minori-
ties  often  fare  even  worse  in  terms  of the
quality of health care received (box 7.7).

An important obstacle to the provision of
equitable  health  services  everywhere  is  the
difﬁculty of enticing urban-educated doctors
to  work  in  poor  areas. Chile, Mexico, and
Thailand  have  used  ﬁnancial  and  other
incentives  to  encourage  qualiﬁed  staff to
work  in  rural  areas.55 In  Indonesia, doctors
had to complete compulsory service in health
centers  before  they  could  obtain  a  lucrative
civil service post. Compulsory service was for
ﬁve  years, with  shorter  periods  allowed  for
work  in  remote  provinces. This  system
increased  the  number  of doctors  in  health
centers by an average of 97 percent from 1985
to 1994, with gains of more than 200 percent
for the most remote provinces.56

B O X   7 . 8 Better maternal health in Malaysia 

and Sri Lanka

Despite huge improvements in health, sur-
vival, and fertility around the world in recent
decades, global maternal mortality has not
declined signiﬁcantly.Two exceptions are Sri
Lanka and Malaysia. In Sri Lanka the mater-
nal mortality ratio—the number of maternal
deaths per 100,000 live births—dropped
from 2,136 in 1930 to 24 in 1996. In Malaysia
it dropped from 1,085 in 1933 to just 19 in
1997.What can account for this impressive
decline? Improving access for rural and dis-
advantaged communities was an important
part of the strategy in both countries.

Sri Lanka and Malaysia made

competent, professional midwives and
supervisory nurse-midwives widely
available in rural areas. Midwives assisted
deliveries in homes and small rural hospitals
and performed initial treatment in the
event of complications.They were given a
steady supply of appropriate drugs and
equipment and supported by improved
communication, transportation, and back-
up services. Besides reducing ﬁnancial and
geographic barriers, they also helped over-
come cultural obstacles and allegiances to
traditional practices. Because midwives
were available locally and were well
respected, they developed links with com-
munities and partnerships with traditional
birth attendants.

Malaysia and Sri Lanka pursued other
complementary strategies.Transportation

(in Malaysia) and transportation subsidies
(in Sri Lanka) were provided for emergency
visits to the hospital. In Malaysia, health pro-
grams were part of integrated rural devel-
opment efforts that included investment in
clinics, rural roads, and rural schools. Simi-
larly, in Sri Lanka, the government invested
in free primary and secondary education,
free health care, and food subsidies for all
districts.The concept was that basic health
care acts in synergy with education and
other types of infrastructure. For example,
better roads make it easier to get to rural
health facilities and facilitate transportation
of obstetric emergencies. By addressing the
multidimensionality of equity, these coun-
tries made signiﬁcant health gains.

Dramatic improvements in maternal
mortality are thus possible. Just as impor-
tant, the experiences of Malaysia and Sri
Lanka show that these can be attained with
only modest expenditures. Since the 1950s,
public expenditures on health services have
hovered between 1.4 and 1.8 percent of
GDP in Malaysia and averaged 1.8 percent
in Sri Lanka, with spending on maternal and
child health (MCH) services amounting to
less than 0.4 percent of GDP in both coun-
tries. Countries with similar income levels
have signiﬁcantly higher health
expenditures and similar, if not higher,
maternal mortality ratios.

in poor areas may not be affordable for many
poor  countries. But 
there  are  other
approaches  to  reducing  the  indirect  costs
(for transport and time spent in transit) and
the medical isolation of poor communities.
Roving extension clinics visit sparsely popu-
lated  areas  in  Afghanistan, Somalia, and
Tunisia  to  provide  care  locally  and  offer
transportation  to  better-equipped  facilities
when  required. Bangladesh, Cuba, Gambia,
India, and Madagascar have trained commu-
nity health workers to scale up service deliv-
ery  for  a  wide  range  of services, including
malaria  prevention, immunizations, family
planning, treatment  of TB  patients, home
visits, and  neonatal  care. The  results  have
often yielded a substantial increase in cover-
age  and  measurable  improvements  in  out-
comes at much lower unit costs. Through a
village  health  worker  program  that  moni-
tored infants’ weight and health for the ﬁrst
month  of
life, rural  infant  mortality  in
Maharasthra, India, was cut in half from 75.5
to  38.8  per  1,000  live  births  between  1995
and 1998.57

Other  outreach  programs  focus  on
maternal health and safe delivery. By mak-
ing  professional  midwives  and  supervisory
nurse-midwives  widely  available  in  rural
areas, Malaysia and Sri Lanka dramatically
reduced maternal mortality rates (box 7.8).
In  Bolivia, expectant  mothers  with  high
obstetric risk are transported to larger clin-
ics  a  few  days  before  their  due  date; in  Sri
Lanka,
they  are  picked  up  by  radio-
dispatched four-wheel-drive vehicles.

Financing affordable care
For consumers, health care ﬁnance systems
have two goals: affordable access to a basic
package, and  ﬁnancial  protection  in  the
event of catastrophic illness costs. The clas-
sic case for government intervention (pub-
lic  subsidies)  is  when  the  full  beneﬁt  of a
“treatment” accrues not just to the individ-
ual  but  also  spills  over  to  the  community
more  broadly. Interventions  to  avoid  the
spread  of malaria  fall  into  this  category. A
bed-net  distribution  program—involving
the  Red  Cross  and  national  ministries  of
health—increased  use  among  the  poorest
quintile from 3 percent to nearly 60 percent
in a northern district of Ghana and from 18

Human capacities

145

percent to 82 percent in ﬁve rural Zambian
districts.58 Immunizations, vector  control,
and interventions for tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS,
and other communicable diseases are simi-
larly deserving.

But  the  case  for  government  interven-
tion goes beyond these well-accepted public
health reasons: inequality in access to ﬁnan-
cial  protection  from  health  risk  based  on
wealth, ethnicity, and  location  provides
another important rationale. Out-of-pocket
payments are the dominant form of health
care ﬁnance in lower-income countries. But
liquidity  constraints  and  imperfect  credit
markets  often  make  out-of-pocket  pay-
ments more difﬁcult for the poor, reducing
their use rates, and health and productivity.
In Vietnam in 1998, before the establish-
ment  of health  insurance, 30  percent  of
poor  households’ nonfood  budget  went  to
medical  costs, while  only  15  percent  of
spending for the richest ﬁfth of the popula-
tion was health related. In Cambodia, a sin-
gle hospital stay absorbed 88 percent of an
average household’s nonfood consumption
in  1997  and, for  the  poorest  among  them,
the cost was higher than the entire nonfood
budget. In  the  transition  economies  of
Europe and Central Asia, with the collapse
of prepayment in the 1990s, out-of-pocket
spending  skyrocketed, accounting  for  as
much  as  80  percent  of health  resources  in
Georgia  and  Azerbaijan. In  Armenia, 91
percent of patients reported having to make
some payment for service received.59 While
health  care  use  has  plummeted  in  the
region, the  collapse  of prepayment  espe-
cially hurts poor people.

The  regressive  nature  of out-of-pocket
payments is well understood, but there are
no  easy  answers, especially  in  low-income
countries. Given  the  small  formal  sector
and  limited  administrative  capacity, these
low-income countries have limited capacity
to  mobilize  resources  to  pay  for  essential
health  services  and  to  establish 
large
enough risk pools. So, developing countries
face a difﬁcult tradeoff between providing a
basic package of health services and extend-
ing  ﬁnancial  protection.60 Some  evidence
suggests  that  the  poor  are  better  able  to
cover 
low-cost, high-frequency  health
low-frequency, high-cost
shocks 

than 

events.61 If so, poor  people  may  be  better
served  by  having  protection  against  these
low-risk, high-cost  events  through  some
type  of pooling  mechanism. It  is  no  easy
task, however, to  cover  catastrophic  health
risks in ways that reach the poor.

Reducing  out-of-pocket  costs  involves  a
combination of pooling health risks and pre-
payment—through  contributory  insurance
schemes, national  health  services  that  are
funded out of general revenues, or a mix of
the  two. In  all  instances, reaching  the  poor
requires  some  means  of subsidizing  their
health care costs, so ﬁscal room and political
commitment are crucial. In very low-income
countries, community  insurance  schemes,
sometimes  supplemented  through  NGO  or
donor funding, can provide some protection
to some people, but generally these services
do not reach the poorest.

Contributory schemes—private or social—
operate  best  where  the  share  of the  formal
labor  market  is  high  and  administrative
capacity  is  strong. And  because  premiums
and  copayments  can  be  unaffordably  high,
purely contributory schemes generally bypass
the  poor. Private  insurance  is  a  signiﬁcant
part  of health  ﬁnance  systems  in  Brazil,
Chile, Namibia, South  Africa, the  United
States, Uruguay, and  Zimbabwe. But  in  all
seven countries, private insurance is used by
formal sector workers, leaving the ministries
of health  to  provide  public  funds  for  pro-
grams for the poor and underserved.62

Social  insurance  is  characterized  by
compulsory  coverage  ﬁnanced  by  employ-
ment taxes. Beneﬁts are often limited to con-
tributors, and providers are often from the
public  sector  even  when  private  providers
are eligible. Social insurance has the appeal
of generating a large risk-sharing pool and
can, in  principle, reach  the  poor  through
cross-subsidization. But, when  the  formal
sector  is  small  this  potential  is  limited,
because of the difﬁculties of enrolling a large
enough  share  of the  population. This  can
turn  the  system  into  a  ticket  to  privileged
access  to  health  services  for  some, while
leaving  the  bulk  of the  population  under-
served. For example, in Mexico, social secu-
rity health spending per person is ﬁve times
higher  than  what  the  Ministry  of Health
spends  per  person.63 And, the  payroll  tax

required  for  social  insurance  introduces
labor  market  distortions, especially  in  set-
tings characterized by dual labor markets.

The challenges from both an equity and
efﬁciency  perspective  are  enormous, but  a
handful of mainly middle-income countries
have  made  important  attempts  to  make
social insurance systems work. Colombia, for
example, has  a  cross-subsidization scheme
for the poor, topped up by general revenues.
The scheme has delivered considerable ben-
eﬁts: higher  coverage  among  the  poor  (48
percent, up  from  9  percent, in  10  years);
lower  out-of-pocket  costs  for  ambulatory
care;
large  increases  in  physician-assisted
delivery  (by  66  percent)  and  prenatal  care
among  rural  women  (by  48  percent); and
lower  child  mortality  rates  (from  44  per

in Thailand

With the introduction of the universal cover-
age scheme in 2002, almost the entire Thai
population now has health coverage (box
ﬁgure 1).This was possible largely because
the democratic transition of 1997 ushered in
a period of increased voice and openness
and raised the political proﬁle of poor peo-
ple’s concerns.Technical preparation—with
design details that had been under consid-
eration and subject to experimentation for
some time—also helped to garner support
for the reform, while prior investments in
health care infrastructure, establishing a
health center in nearly every rural subdis-
trict, provided assurance of implementation
success.

Years of corruption and political

inequity in the early 1990s, together with
the intervening period of military rule fuel-
ing social discontent, prepared the ground
for democratic reforms and a liberal consti-
tution in 1997.Two provisions of the new
constitution were important for the ensuing
health sector reforms: the principle of
equity in health care access; and the scope
for civil society to propose national legisla-
tion affecting citizen rights and the role of
the state, if the measure had 50,000 signa-
tures. In March 2000, nearly at the same
time that a feasibility study for the scheme
was completed, a network of 11 NGOs sub-
mitted to parliament a draft bill calling for
universal health care coverage. Between
1999 and 2001, the press also captured the
general public’s interest and kept the issue
on the political agenda by highlighting the
shortcomings of the current health system.

This political foment attracted the

attention of the opposition Thai Rak Thai
(TRT) party.TRT adopted the policy because
it was broadly supported, administratively
and technically feasible, and consistent with
the party’s ideology.TRT effectively turned
the 1997 ﬁnancial crisis into an opportunity
by highlighting the health issues
precipitated by the crisis. Following its land-
slide victory in 2001,TRT introduced its own
universal coverage legislation, which passed
in November 2002.

1,000 births to 15) among the insured. But
there  are  questions  about  the  program’s
sustainability in the face of mounting ﬁscal
cost—reﬂecting  the  difﬁculty  of systemic
reforms  that  threaten  the  privileges  of
established  interests,
in  this  case, public
hospitals and the prereform social security
institution.64

Ministries  of health  in  many  developing
countries  operate  essentially  as  national
health services, with nationally owned health
sector  inputs  and  funding  from  general  tax
revenues. The systems they manage are often
inefﬁcient  and  inequitable, reﬂecting  severe
resource  and  institutional  capacity  con-
straints but also a bias in favor of the wealthy
and  inﬂuential. Services  are  meant  to  cover
everyone, but  high  out-of-pocket  payments
keep  many  poor  people  from  participating.
Countries  have  tried  various  approaches  to
improve equity in access to health care pro-
vided by the national health system, such as
eliminating user fees for all, waiving fees, or
giving vouchers to poor people.

In  2001, Uganda  abolished  user  fees  for
all. The  result  was  a  signiﬁcant  increase  in
health care use, lower probability of sickness,
and better anthropometric measures, partic-
ularly for the poor.65 But the elimination of
user fees, if effective, can reduce the resources
for  the  health  sector, and  thus  its  quality,
unless  budgetary  funding  is  topped  up  to
make up for the shortfall. Uganda appears to
have  avoided  a  fall  in  quality, thanks  to  a
large increase in the health budget that more
than  compensated  for  the  loss  in  revenues
from eliminating user charges.

Introduced in 2002, Thailand’s “30 baht”
or universal coverage scheme aims to guaran-
tee health care to every Thai citizen. It com-
bines previously existing schemes targeted to
the poor and uninsured, and allocates budg-
etary  resources  to  providers  on  a  capitation
basis, with only a small copayment per visit
(30  baht). The  Ministry  of Public  Health
remains a strategic manager and central ﬁn-
ancier, but the district ofﬁces make the deci-
sions on choice of providers. The scheme has
markedly  increased  use  and  coverage, with
roughly three-quarters of the country bene-
ﬁting from the scheme and 95 percent of the
population  insured  overall, all  at  a  limited
additional budgetary cost (box 7.9).

But there is broad agreement that exist-
ing capitation rates are too low and that the
system  is  underfunded. This  provides  lim-
ited incentives for private providers to par-
ticipate  and  could  lead  to  a  ﬁnancial
squeeze  on  public  providers  with  adverse
impacts  on  quality.66 Higher  use  has  also
put  a  strain  on  human  resources, with
increased workloads (and low pay) acceler-
ating the number of physicians leaving the
public system. Clearly supply-side measures
need  to  be  considered  in  tandem  with
health  ﬁnance  reforms  to  expand  access.
Still, the achievements have been consider-
able, and  the  scheme  has  broad  popular
support. Thailand implemented the reform
in large part thanks to the popular support
that  democratic  reforms  made  possible;
previous  investments  in  sound  design  and
health infrastructure also helped.

Other  countries  reduce  costs  for  the
poor  through  targeted  programs  funded
from  general  revenues. Armenia’s  targeted
fee-waiver  system  curbed  plummeting  use
among  the  poor. But  in  many  instances,
simple  legislation  of free  or  reduced-price
services  can  be  counterproductive  without
good  funding  and  targeting. Targeted  pay-
ments, through  government  vouchers  and
civil society partnerships with hospitals, can
help. Vouchers issued to poor patients, as by
the MCH poverty alleviation fund in Yun-
nan  Province  in  China, give  providers  a
greater  assurance  of payment. In  Cambo-
dia, a  promising  partnership  has  emerged
between  government  hospitals, Médecins
Sans  Frontières  (MSF)  and  a  small  local
NGO, covering  the  hospital  fees  of those
considered  indigent  by  the  local  NGO’s
social workers. Because the hospital is fully
compensated, poor  patients  receive  the
same care as those who can pay.67

Vietnam has introduced health cards for
the poor. More than 11 million of 14.3 mil-
lion  eligible  people  beneﬁted  from  Viet-
nam’s program in its ﬁrst year of implemen-
tation  in  2002. The  program  has  already
signiﬁcantly  increased  the  ﬂow  of govern-
ment health funding to the poor and to pre-
dominantly poor areas of the country. The
funding per beneﬁciary, however, is consid-
ered 
the  cost-sharing
arrangements are likely to impose too large a

inadequate  and 

burden on populations in poorer or ethnic
minority regions.68

Many developing countries have a mixed
system, with  ministries  of health, private
insurance, social  insurance, and  targeted
schemes  coexisting  to  serve  different  seg-
ments  of the  population. These  multitrack
systems tend to fragment, increasing admin-
istrative costs, limiting pool sizes, and under-
mining both equity and efﬁciency objectives.
Chile’s  two-track  universal  coverage  system
has  caused  severe  segmentation, with  the
healthy  and  wealthy  in  the  private  scheme,
leaving  the  public  scheme  overburdened
with the poor and ill. Chile is trying to over-
come this by creating a “virtual pool,” man-
dating  a  common  basic  beneﬁts  package,
instituting  catastrophic  insurance, allowing
portability of beneﬁts between schemes, and
initiating  minimum  quality  and  maximum
wait-time standards.

Community-based health insurance (CBHI)
schemes have developed in some poor com-
munities  outside  the  reach  of national
health  systems. Communities  pool  health
risks  through  voluntary  contributions  to  a
local fund used when any member incurs a
health  shock. The  schemes  are  reported  to
reduce  out-of-pocket  spending  and  in-
crease use by their members, but they gen-
erally  do  not  reach  the  poorest  and
socially excluded groups or offer members
enough  protection  from  financial  risk.
Many are limited by their small risk pools,
exposing  them  to  low-frequency  but  high-
cost  catastrophic  events  that  can  outstrip
the  community  fund. Some  communities
address large health risks by increasing the
maximum  beneﬁt, as  in  Cameroon. But
they do so by limiting the number of fam-
ily’s  claims  to  one  a  year  and  by  requiring
high  premiums  (which  prohibit  the  poor
from participating).69

Insurance  alone  is  not  enough  for  equi-
table  use. Inadequate  knowledge  of
the
scheme’s beneﬁts and processes and even the
paperwork for submitting claims to commu-
nity  insurance  schemes  can  be  a  deterrent.
Hospitals  often  require  payment  on  or
before  discharge, but  insurance  claims  are
not  settled  until  later, requiring  patients  to
pay up front. India’s Self-Employed Women’s

Association  (SEWA)  has  been  seeking  to
remedy similar difﬁculties encountered in its
large  and  well-established  CBHI  scheme.
SEWA  is  testing  door-to-door  visits  for
member  education, reimbursement  assur-
ance with selected hospitals, and reimburse-
ment to members while still in hospital.70

Enhancing provider incentives
Addressing  knowledge, access  and  afford-
ability  constraints  are  important, but  they
may not be enough to raise health use and
outcomes. Hours of operation, waiting time,
staff disposition, competence and integrity,
and the cultural appropriateness of services
are all important. Complaints of unprofes-
sional  treatment, abuse, and  corruption
abound  worldwide. Public  medical  staff
who take authorized or unauthorized leave
from public clinics undermine the credibil-
ity of the public health sector, drive up costs
for poor families, and induce the poor to use
private providers, including traditional heal-
ers. In  Bangladesh, such  absenteeism  rates
amount  to  40  percent  for  physicians  in
larger clinics and 74 percent in smaller sub-
centers with a single physician. More gener-
ally, poor  service  delivery  has  to  do  with
weak management and incentives within the
public  health  system—ineffective  technical
and  structural  backup, lack  of professional
career  structures, and  inadequate  ﬁnancial
incentives  all  contribute. But  the  weak
demand for service provider accountability
and quality is also a problem.71

If they  are  organized, poor  citizens  and
communities  can  have  more  voice  and
greater power to inﬂuence health providers.
Governments can help support organization
by  communities  and  enhance  provider
accountability. It helps to have well-deﬁned
objectives  for  health  service  delivery  with
transparent metrics for monitoring progress.
This  allows  for  community  oversight  of
health workers and facilities, and when cou-
pled with sufﬁcient management autonomy
for providers to reach the established objec-
tives, can  lead  to  improved  provider  incen-
tives and accountability.

There  is  also  a  need  for  governments  to
engage with nonpublic health care providers:
in  many  countries, NGO  and  private
providers make up a large part of the health

network. NGOs  are  particularly  helpful  in
serving remote areas and hard-to-reach pop-
ulations: the Bangladesh Rural Advancement
Committee (BRAC) trains community work-
ers to seek out the extremely poor in need of
urgent medical care. In Jordan, half or more
of outpatient visits are to private providers.72
Many  private  providers  offer  excellent  serv-
ices. But  some  do  not—and  misdiagnose,
misprescribe, or overprescribe treatment. In
Mexico, even  wealthy  women  receive  worse
care from private providers than from public
providers  (Barber, Bertossi, and  Gertler
2005). Without unduly discouraging beneﬁ-
cial private enterprise in health, governments
need to ensure accreditation and appropriate
regulation for nonpublic providers.

Social protection: managing risk
and providing social assistance
Social  protection  policies  typically  have
been thought of as a form of redistribution.
This certainly is important. But more recent
theoretical  and  empirical  work  also  high-
lights a crucial opportunity-enhancing role
for social protection.73 As chapter 5 showed,
pervasive ﬁnancial market failures in devel-
oping  countries  lead  to  widespread  unin-
sured risks and credit constraints. Unequal
capacity  to  manage  risk  means  unequal
opportunities  to  engage  in  risky  but  high-
return  activities. Families  may  deal  with
crises in ways that narrow future opportu-
nities, such  as  distress  sales  and  forgoing
health  care, schooling, or  food  intake. By
helping  poor  people  manage  risks, social
protection programs expand their opportu-
nities and enhance overall efﬁciency.

Even purely redistributive programs can
have important opportunity-enhancing im-
pacts. Take  the  example  of social  pension
schemes  in  Brazil  and  South Africa. These
schemes  are  pure  transfers  targeted  to  the
elderly, geared  strictly  to  avoiding  destitu-
tion, but  they  have  important  welfare
impacts  beyond  that. They  improve  the
recipients’ access  to  credit, thanks  to  the
regularity of pension payments, and lead to
higher investments in the household’s phys-
ical capital and in the human capital of its
children and elderly.74

But  social  protection  systems  do  more
than help individual households avoid des-

titution  and  expand  their  opportunities—
they  can  also  help  societies  embark  on
reforms  that  would  have  insurmountable
equity  and  political  costs  without  them.
Reforms  desirable  for  their  beneﬁcial  im-
pacts  on  efﬁciency  and  the  government’s
ﬁscal  position—such  as  increasing  utility
prices, eliminating  general  food  subsidies,
introducing a deﬁned contribution pension
system,
liberalizing  trade—may  not  be
politically  feasible  unless  policies  are  in
place  to  compensate  losers. Importantly,
permanent  social  protection  can  help
reduce  the  need  for  special  compensatory
programs for each and every reform75—all
the more important because such programs
are  difﬁcult  to  start  and  stop  and  are  not
always very efﬁcient.

All  of

this  conﬁrms  that  there  is  a
dynamic efﬁciency rationale for social pro-
tection. But  there  are  also  important  efﬁ-
ciency  arguments  against  transfer  policies.
Design  issues  are  of particular  concern,
because poorly designed programs can have
large  negative  consequences  on  efﬁciency.
Taxes  or  contributions  have  distortionary
costs, especially  when  they  are  not  directly
linked to beneﬁts (see focus 5 for a discus-
sion  of tax  policies), while  transfers  can
dampen work incentives, reduce private sav-
ings, and weaken informal insurance mech-
anisms. Europe’s  experience  in  the  second
half of the 1900s suggests that well-designed
social (and tax) policies can indeed be con-
sistent with strong growth thanks to careful
attention to productivity impacts.76

Program choices vary by country
Social protection generally encompasses two
classes of interventions:

• Contributory schemes (social insurance)
in which the primary focus is on manag-
ing risks through smoothing an individ-
ual’s income over time and in the face of
difﬁculties  These  programs  often  pool
risks across large numbers of individuals
and  include  old-age  and  disability  pen-
sions  and  health  and  unemployment
insurance.

• General  tax  funded  transfers  (social
assistance)  in  which  the  focus  is  on
redistribution from the better off to the

poor. These include a variety of cash or
in-kind programs targeted at the poor.

These are complemented by labor mar-
ket regulations (for example, on hiring and
ﬁring  of workers)  that  are  discussed  in
chapter  9. There  is  large  variation  in  the
share  of GDP  spent  on  social  protection,
with more-developed regions devoting con-
siderable  sums  (ﬁgure  7.5). Almost  all
countries  spend  more  on  social  insurance
than social assistance programs.

There is no consensus on the appropriate
balance of interventions—even in countries
that have sufﬁcient resources and capacity to
implement any combination desired. Some
observers argue for the universality of social
insurance programs over the targeted nature
of social assistance programs that are based
on  political  economy  considerations. They
argue that targeted programs are exclusion-
ary, by deﬁnition, and divisive as a result.77
But a signiﬁcant group of OECD countries
(notably New Zealand, Australia, the United
States, and the United Kingdom) have opted
for systems with heavier components of tar-
geted transfers and less generous or less uni-
versal programs.78

Many  developing  countries  face  con-
straints on the choice of systems because of
limited  ﬁscal  and  administrative  capacity.

tries  lack  the  administrative  sophistication
and  levels  of urbanization  and  formal
employment needed to administer a social
insurance scheme, and high social security
taxes have segmented the labor market and
encouraged informality.

What then are the options for the many
developing countries that are far from able
to  achieve  universal  social  insurance  sys-
tems? There is a large range of social assis-
tance  programs, each  different  in  groups
served, administrative  requirements, com-
plementary  beneﬁts, incentive  effects, and
political  factors  (table  7.1). A  judicious
blending  of
these  programs  can  usually
result in a social protection system that cov-
ers  the  appropriate  groups  with  feasible
instruments. The mix of programs selected
and their speciﬁc characteristics will depend
on context—that is, the risks faced, the level
of urbanization, the age structure, the size of
the formal sector, the administrative capac-
ity, and  the  complementary  social  policies
and sociocultural or political factors.

Next, we  discuss  programs  for  four  key

groups:

• The working poor
• The nonworking young
• The nonworking elderly
• Special vulnerable groups

In many cases, the second two groups are part
of households  that  could  beneﬁt  from  pro-
grams  that  target  the  working  poor. So  the
more  comprehensive  the  programs  for  the
ﬁrst group, the less the need for programs for
the  latter  two, and  the  smaller  and  more
focused they might be.

Programs for the working poor
Most people, especially poor people, rely on
labor earnings for their livelihoods, many in
the  informal  sector,
through  subsistence
farming, or as agricultural laborers for others.
Labor  market  risk  can  be  reduced  signiﬁ-
cantly by improving the functioning of labor
markets  and  by  pursuing  sound  macroeco-
nomic policies (chapter 9). But even a well-
functioning labor market will not fully elimi-
nate the risk of unemployment. Moreover, in
years with bad crops or low prices, earnings
may not be enough to stave off poverty.

A range of instruments can help address
the risk of inadequate incomes—for exam-
ple, unemployment insurance, needs-based
social  assistance, or  public  works. Even
food, utility, and housing price subsidies are
geared  in  part  to  solving  the  problems  of
inadequate  labor  incomes, although  with
notably poor targeting and sometimes large
distortionary costs.

Unemployment  insurance, the  obvious
instrument  for  mitigating  the  risk  of job
loss in the formal sector, will not work well
in  countries  with  large  informal  sectors.
Even so, schemes may be able to cover a use-
ful share of workers and take some burden
off programs more tailored to those in the
informal sector (chapter 9). For example, in
1998 in response to the East Asian ﬁnancial
crisis, Korea expanded its young unemploy-
ment insurance program to smaller ﬁrms as
well as to temporary and daily workers.79

Needs-based  cash  transfers, the  classic
social  assistance  instrument, are  common
in  high-income  countries. Such  programs
are  potentially  very  efﬁcient. Nontransfer
costs can be low, usually 5 to 10 percent of

Human capacities

total program costs. The programs need not
impose signiﬁcant forgone earnings on par-
ticipants. And they give cash and, thus full
consumer sovereignty, to the recipient.

But  these  programs  face  two  challenges.
First, they  require  a  targeting  mechanism.
The classic mechanism in high-income coun-
tries has been a veriﬁed means test. Because
income in these settings is mostly formal, it is
possible and not too costly to collect accurate
information  on  income  and  assets. Eastern
Europe  also  has  successful  experience  with
means-tested  programs, although  verifying
incomes and assets is more difﬁcult and less
accurate  there  than  in  high-income  coun-
tries. Latin  America’s  proxy  means  tests
(relying  on  easily  observable  indicators  of
income) have been shown to be fairly accu-
rate and low cost. Low-income countries with
large shares of income from the informal sec-
tor  experience  greater  difﬁculties  in  setting
up  targeting  mechanism. Although  the  evi-
dence is less clear-cut, community-based sys-
tems have been shown to work well in some
countries  around  the  world, especially  in
fairly  homogenous 
communities
(Albania, Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Indonesia,
Uganda, and Uzbekistan) where elite capture
is not a major concern. So the targeting issue
could be surmounted.80

rural 

The second challenge is perhaps bigger—
both for technical design and political sup-
port. Needs-based transfers inherently pres-
ent  a  disincentive  to  work  for  those  of
working  age  because  entry  into  the  pro-
gram  (or  the  beneﬁt  level)  depends  on
income. Traditional  mechanisms  to  partly
mitigate  the  work  disincentives  include
keeping  beneﬁts  substantially  lower  than
minimum wage, as in Bulgaria or Romania,
or  lower  than  the  earning  of low-skilled
agricultural laborers, as in Kyrgyz Republic,
or using a sliding withdrawal of beneﬁts as
incomes  rise, as  in  much  of the  industrial
world, or an earned-income tax credit as in
the United Kingdom and United States.81

A newer wave of efforts takes a more active
approach  to  encouraging  independence  or
“graduation” from  the  need  for  assistance
than  under  the  traditional  mechanisms  just
mentioned. Chile’s  Puente  program  uses
extensive social work to diagnose each house-
hold’s  barriers  to  independence  and  to  pre-

pare  customized  contracts  with  the  house-
hold to address the most important of these
barriers  over  a  period  of
two  years.
Bangladesh’s program of income generation
for  the  development  of vulnerable  groups
(IGVGD run by BRAC) gives  in-kind  assis-
tance to destitute rural women for a period
of 18  months. During  this  time, they  are
required to save some money and participate
in business training. At the end of the cycle,
women  have  the  opportunity  of “graduat-
ing” into the regular microﬁnance program.
A few programs, as in Romania and Bulgaria,
add a public service requirement (thus blur-
ring the line between the means-tested social
assistance and public works programs).82 So,
whether  through  traditional  or  more  inno-
vative mechanisms, the disincentive problem
can also be mitigated.

Public  works  programs  that  support  the
working or unemployed poor have been used
in  many  countries  (box  7.10). By  offering
employment  for  low  wages, these  programs
self-select  the  able-bodied  poor, avoiding
both  the  means-testing  and  work  disincen-
tives. In good programs, the work is in high-
return  activities  that  create  assets  and  serv-
ices. The  self-targeting  aspect 
is  useful
because informality is widespread in develop-
ing countries and incomes are hard to assess.
It is doubly useful as part of a countercyclical
measure in ﬁghting poverty during periods of
crisis—workers leave the program when their
regular  source  of livelihood  picks  up  again
after  the  crisis. Public  works  programs  for
infrastructure are especially welcome in low-
income  countries, postconﬂict  settings, and
sometimes post–natural disaster settings.

Public works programs have some disad-
vantages  too. The  administrative  capacity  to
select  and  run  the  programs  is  signiﬁcant.
Indeed  the  often-cited  good  programs  are  a
minority  of all  the  public  works  programs
implemented  around  the  world. Many  have
failed, often over the inability to line up and
deliver useful public works, to provide sufﬁ-
cient nonlabor inputs, or to set the wage right.
Even when programs are well run, the net
beneﬁts transferred to participants are often
a  small  share  of total  program  costs. First,
management, materials, equipment, and

B O X   7 . 1 0 Public works programs: key issues

Public works programs have been
demonstrated to work in some middle-income
countries (Chile, Argentina, and South Africa)
and low-income countries (Senegal, Kenya,
India, and Bangladesh)—and not to work in
many others.This international experience
offers several lessons in the design and imple-
mentation of public works programs.

Wage rate. The key to self-targeting is setting
the wage rate low enough—no higher than the
market wage for unskilled manual labor in agri-
culture or the informal sector during a normal
year.While determining the precise level of the
wage rate may not be easy, it is better to start
with a wage rate that is too low—if there is no
demand at the offered wage rate, it can be
raised. Setting a low wage rate level does more
than ensure that the workfare scheme will be
well self-targeted. It also maintains the incentive
to take up regular work when it becomes avail-
able, and it helps ensure that the program can
reach as many of those in need as possible.

Conditions of eligibility. Rationing should be
avoided; ideally the only requirement should be
the willingness to work at the offered wage. If
rationing is unavoidable (for example, if the
demand for employment at the wage set
exceeds the available budget), explicit secondary
criteria should be used—the program may tar-
get poor areas, work may be offered only in sea-
sons of greatest need, the length of employment
of any individual may be limited, or such addi-

tional options as community-based selection of
the neediest or a lottery may be implemented.
Least desirable is rationing with entry
determined by foremen or political ﬁgures.
Women’s participation can be enhanced through
nondiscriminatory wages, the provision of onsite
child care, and adequately private latrines.

Employment guarantee. A workfare program

that guarantees employment can reduce the
longer-term risk the poor face.While highly
desirable, guarantees have not been a feature of
most public workfare schemes. One exception is
the Employment Guarantee Scheme in Maha-
rasthra, India, which guarantees unskilled man-
ual work within the district within 15 days of
registering for employment with the scheme.
While this does not necessarily mean locally
accessible employment, the scheme comes clos-
est to offering a guarantee of any kind. India
recently announced its intention to extend the
guarantee by providing 100 days of
employment on rural public works projects at a
minimum wage.The scheme is not far enough
into implementation to draw lessons. Murgai
and Ravallion (2005) simulate some possible
outcomes for a range of design parameters: the
targeting could be good and impacts of poverty
large, but the costs could also be substantial—1
to 2 percent of GDP for the 100-day scheme.

Labor intensity. The labor intensity—that is,
the share of the wage bill in total costs—should
be higher than normal for similar projects in the

same setting.There is a tradeoff between imme-
diate income gains through employment of the
poor, and gains to the poor from the quality and
durability of the assets created. In a crisis situa-
tion, in which current transfers to the poor have
high weight, a high labor intensity is desirable.
Illustrative average labor intensities range from
0.5 to 0.65 percent in low-income countries and
are somewhat lower (0.4) in middle-income
countries, although labor intensity often varies
signiﬁcantly by subprojects.

Administration and implementation. Admin-
istering and implementing an effective scheme
is hard—requiring the selection and manage-
ment of a plethora of small projects over a wide
geographic area and many administrative enti-
ties. Ideally, public works schemes require a
menu of works well-integrated into the local
planning process yet elastic in size and timing.
This can be difﬁcult in low-capacity settings
because of the forward planning and
interagency coordination needed. In high-
capacity settings, ﬁtting many small labor-
intensive projects into the sophisticated and
often capital-intensive infrastructure plans of
large- and middle-income cities can be difﬁcult.
Moreover, ensuring that the workfare program is
poverty focused is not easy because of conﬂict-
ing pressures from alternative target groups,
such as the skilled unemployed.

workers have to forgo some income to par-
ticipate: in the absence of the program, they
usually  would  have  been  able  to  pick  up
some part-time work or engage in low-return
self-employment  activities. In  Argentina’s
Trabajar, forgone earnings were half of gross
in  Maharashtra’s  Employment
earnings;
Guarantee  scheme, 53  percent; and 
in
Bolivia’s ESF, 60 percent.83 Theoretically, for-
gone earnings can be minimized by allowing
ﬂexible  working  hours  or  part-time  work,
but  this  can  complicate  the  supervision  of
the public works and the workers.

Programs for the nonworking young
Earlier, we focused on interventions geared to
overcoming the disadvantaged family circum-
stances of young children through a variety of
services that improve their cognitive and social
skills and prepare them for learning in school.
Here  we  focus  on  ways  of augmenting  the
family’s  income  to  alleviate  poverty  among
children and improve their chances in life.

Programs aimed at children can be uni-
versal  or  means-tested,
free-standing  or
linked  to  the  use  of health  and  education
services.
In  both  Eastern  and  Western
Europe, the traditional approach to income
support  for  children 
is  through  child
allowances, independent from but comple-
mented  by  extensive  public  education  and
health  care. Most  Western  European  pro-
grams  are  universal, although  a  few  are
means-tested  (Italy  and  Spain). A  higher
fraction of Eastern European programs and
those in other middle-income countries are
means-tested  (Bulgaria, Belarus, the  Czech
Republic,
the  Kyrgyz  Republic, Poland,
Romania, the  Russian  Federation, Serbia
and  Montenegro,
the  Slovak  Republic,
Argentina, Chile). In Africa, Latin America,
and Asia, there is a long and extensive his-
tory of school feeding programs and mater-
nal and child health programs that distrib-
ute  food  (or  occasionally  food  stamps).
Many  of these  programs  rely  on  existing

service  delivery  mechanisms  to  make  their
administration feasible or cheaper.

A  new  wave  of CCT  recognizes  that
imperfect  markets  can  lead  to  underinvest-
ment  in  human  capital  (chapter  5)  and
explicitly seeks to enhance the opportunity-
generating  potential  of
income  support
through  links  to  the  use  of services. CCT
programs  are  now  being  implemented  in
about two dozen countries, mainly in Latin
America—but  they  are  being  discussed  by
many  other  countries  and  in  all  regions.
These  programs  transfer  income  in  cash  or
in  kind  to  poor  households  with  children.
They grant beneﬁts only if children comply
with  standards  for  attendance  in  school  or
participation in a health care program. In the
CCT programs with good data, the targeting
outcomes have been quite good at generally
reasonable administrative costs. All ﬁve pro-
grams reviewed by Morley and Coady (2003)
distribute far more than a proportional share
to the bottom quintiles (table 7.2). On aver-
age, the  share  of program  beneﬁts  going  to
the  bottom  40  percent  of the  population  is
an  impressive  81  percent. The  evidence  on
poverty  impact  is  more  limited, but  PRO-
GRESA (now Oportunidades) had a power-
ful effect: program communities experienced
declines  of 17.4  percent  in  the  incidence  of
poverty compared with the control group.84
The  conditioning  of beneﬁts  on  use  of
health  and  education  services  serves  the
dual  objectives  of avoiding  severe  depriva-
tion  and  enhancing  opportunities 
for
human development. But there is a tension
between  these  goals. A  simulation  of the
results that might be expected from the fed-
eral  Bolsa  Escola  program  in  Brazil  shows
only a small reduction (1 percentage point)
in the poverty index because of the (simu-
lated) loss of labor income of children who
drop out of the labor force to attend school.
Mexico’s PROGRESA (now Oportunidades)
had 
impacts  but
increased primary enrollment rates by only
about 1 percentage point because they were
already above 90 percent. Cambodia’s pro-
gram, which  focuses  on  grades  seven
through nine, may well help with the transi-
tion to secondary school, but it misses some
of the poorest households because so many
have dropped out by then.85

In settings with low access to health and
education services, this tension means that
conditional  transfer  programs  may  not  be
appropriate  vehicles  for  social  assistance.
The  conditions  would  keep  the  program
from serving the poorest. The opposite may
be true as well: when the use of services is
already  satisfactory, it  may  not  be  worth
using  administrative  resources  to  verify
compliance with service use conditions.

Programs for the nonworking elderly
Most  countries  have  public  pensions  pro-
grams  for  the  elderly. Two  arguments  pro-
vide a rationale for governments to mandate
a  pension  system  to  provide  for  old-age
security: imperfect  ﬁnancial  markets  limit
the  scope  for  redistribution  over  one’s  life,
and human “failures” to see far enough into
the future may lead to undersaving for old
age. The need for old-age security will grow.
The  population  of 60  year  olds, about  10
percent  of the  world  population  today, is
projected to reach about 21 percent by 2050.
Within  this  group, the  fraction  of people
over the age of 80, about 12 percent today, is
expected to reach 19 percent by 2050.86

Contributory  pension  programs  have
not solved the problem of old-age security.
Coverage  is  low—only  20  percent  of the
global  workforce. Even  in  pension  systems
with  extensive  coverage, the  lifetime  poor
cannot contribute enough to have a pension
at  old  age  that  would  keep  them  out  of
poverty. Elderly  women  who  have  not
worked  outside  the  home  are  particularly
vulnerable. Moreover, in  some  countries,
such  as  in  Kenya, Uganda, Sri  Lanka, and
Zambia, poorly  governed  schemes  gave

154

WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2006

lower-income  workers  returns  less  than
bank deposits and the alternatives of invest-
ing in land, tools, or a vehicle.87

Options  for  assisting  the  elderly  poor
include  the  following: broadening  pension
systems  to  include  more  people, adding  a
redistributive element as part of an existing
contributory  pension  scheme, or  covering
them  through  a  separate  “social  pension”
ﬁnanced  by  general  revenue. A  fourth
option is a general needs-based social assis-
tance program.

Broadening  the  coverage  of contributory
pensions  has  been  attempted, generally  with
little success. In the Republic of Korea, man-
dating the expansion of coverage to farmers,
ﬁshermen, and  self-employed  was  met  with
massive protests; in the end, the government
had to subsidize in full or in part the contribu-
tions of almost two-thirds of the target popu-
lation. Adding  a  redistributive  element  is
common, but as pension reforms strengthen
the  link  between  contributions  and  beneﬁts
for efﬁciency reasons, that redistributive ele-
ment is becoming smaller.

Social  pensions  provide  transfers  to  the
elderly without requiring prior contributions
or withdrawing from the labor force.88 They
can be universal, as in Botswana, Mauritius,
Namibia, or Bolivia. Or they can be means-
tested, as  in  South  Africa, Senegal, India,
Bangladesh, a  number  of Latin  American
countries, Australia, Italy, and New Zealand.
Many of them complement contributory sys-
tems that cover higher-income groups. When
the transfers are means-tested, the programs
are  really  a  special  case  of needs-based  cash
transfers limited to the elderly. The targeting
challenges discussed earlier and the potential
solutions are similar. Labor disincentives are
lessened, however, because  societies  expect
lower work efforts from the elderly.89

Evidence  from  various  countries  imple-
menting  large  social  pension  schemes  indi-
cates that the costs are 1 to 2 percent of GDP,
not  negligible  for  low-income  developing
countries. Schwartz  (2003)  simulates  the
costs  in  six  African  countries  of providing
social  pensions, limiting  the  beneﬁt  to  40
percent of GDP per capita and eligibility to
those  age  75  and  above. The  costs  would
range from 0.2 percent of GDP in Kenya to
0.7 percent of GDP in Ghana, still not insub-

stantial. Kakwani and Subbarao (2005) sim-
ulate  various  options  for  15  African  coun-
tries, and conclude that the best—taking into
account  poverty  impact, ﬁscal  cost, and
incentive effects—is to keep the beneﬁt low
(about  one-third  of the  poverty  threshold),
the  eligible  age  limit  at  65  or  older, and  to
target only the elderly poor, thus sacriﬁcing
the  administrative  simplicity  and  political
advantage of universalism. There is enough
variation across countries to warrant country-
speciﬁc efforts to determine beneﬁt and eli-
gibility  levels  and  targeting  methods  rather
than relying on rules of thumb.

How should we think about the balance
between social pensions for the elderly and
other  programs, such  as  those  targeting
families with children? Are the elderly poor
more  deserving  than  other  poor?  Brazil
spends 1 percent of GDP to transfer $70 a
month to 5.3 million elderly poor and only
0.15  percent  of GDP  to  transfer  $6  to  $19
per month to 5 million families to support
school attendance through the Bolsa Escola
program.90 When considering whether this
the  right  balance, one  can  argue  generally
that young families with children, who have
their entire lives ahead of them, should have
higher priority. Indeed some argue for shift-
ing  public  spending  away  from  pensions
and toward families with children in Brazil
and  others  suggest  that  a  focus  on  unem-
ployment  may  be  more  appropriate  to
reduce poverty in South Africa.91

There  may  be  important  political  econ-
omy  reasons  why  programs  for  the  elderly
garner such political support. There is direct
evidence  from  attitude  surveys, across  soci-
eties and age groups, that concerns about old
age  poverty  are  strong  and  widely  shared—
perhaps because most people expect to be old
one day (but not necessarily unemployed, or
a single parent, or disabled) and also because
old age is more easily veriﬁable and less sub-
ject to moral hazard, for example, when com-
pared with unemployment insurance.92

Programs for special 
vulnerable groups
Some  groups  are  vulnerable  regardless  of
age—the  disabled, HIV  infected, ethnic
minorities, certain  castes,
internally  dis-
placed  households, refugees, and  orphans

(box 7.11).93 One of the key issues in provid-
ing  transfers  for  these  groups  is  whether  to
set up speciﬁc programs or to include them
in a more general program. There is no uni-
versal  answer  to  this, and  a  complex  set  of
issues must be diagnosed in each case. One is
targeting. Not  all  orphans, widows, or  dis-
abled  are  poor, so  universal  programs  will
include  some  non-poor. A  second  issue
relates to the special needs of the groups. Will
income  support  alone  be  sufﬁcient, and  if
not (as is usually the case) does it make sense
to  link  the  income  support  to  other  pro-
grams  for  the  group?  For  example, when
large groups of internally displaced people or
refugees  emerge  suddenly, their  needs  for
housing, food, and  health  care  may  strain
local availability. In such cases in-kind provi-
sion to the group is usually the ﬁrst response.
Only after the groups become long-standing
or  somewhat  smaller  does  the  question  of
whether  to  switch  to  a  needs-based  cash
assistance or workfare program arise. Special
programs for groups viewed positively or as
deserving, such  as  veterans  or  the  disabled,
may  have  adequate  political  support, but  if
the group is excluded, as ethnic minorities or
the HIV positive are in many cases, such pro-
grams may not garner sufﬁcient support.

While  standard  transfers  may  protect
these  groups, a  broader  set  of policies  can
help expand their opportunities and facili-
tate  their  integration  into  society. Some
countries have used afﬁrmative action (see
chapter  8). Others  have  used  regulations
and  awareness  campaigns  that  sanction
harmful local practices to help prevent dis-
crimination. Policy responses include creat-
ing  a  framework  to  hear  advocacy  groups
and mainstreaming such concerns into gov-
ernment  practice, often  building  on  infor-
mal or private arrangements, such as those
of faith-based organizations.

Summary
Equity in the acquisition of human capaci-
ties—through  early  childhood  develop-
ment, formal  education, health  services,
and  social  protection—is  at  the  core  of a
strategy  to  equalize  the  opportunities  for
people  to  lead  productive, fulﬁlling  lives.
Broad provisioning of these services is also
good  for  development  and  poverty  reduc-

B O X   7 . 1 1 Africa’s orphans and public action

Conﬂict and the HIV/AIDS pandemic are
generating a major humanitarian crisis for
families in Sub-Saharan Africa.There are as
many as 43 million orphaned children in the
region today, 10 percent of whom have lost
both parents. Orphans make up more than
15 percent of all children in 11 countries,
and the numbers are rising .

The death of an earning family member

is most likely to drive a family into penury
because of the costs of funeral, the loss of
regular income, and the risk of losing one’s
property. Erosion of human capital is
another major risk: microstudies and analy-
sis of household surveys suggest that, rela-
tive to other children in the household, fos-
tered children are underenrolled in schools,
work longer hours doing household chores,
and have lower immunization coverage—
and the disadvantage is stronger for
fostered girls than for fostered boys. Psycho-
logical risks are also high because the death
of a parent often leaves the child in a state
of trauma, lacking nurturance and
guidance, and impeding socialization.

The main coping strategy in Africa is fos-
tering by the extended family.When possible,

interventions should ﬁrst try to strengthen
grassroots responses to orphan care, and turn
to supplementary interventions only when
the extended family is no longer sufﬁcient or
capable.When no other living arrangement is
possible, experience and research show that
orphanages must be the “last resort.”Recog-
nizing the scope for exploitation of vulnera-
ble children under all arrangements, appro-
priate checks and balances must be in place,
including oversight by NGOs or community-
based organizations.

When access to basic education and
health services is generally low, waiving
school fees and uniform obligations would
help increase enrollment rates of all
children including orphans, as in Uganda.
When average access to services is high, but
the difference in access between the poor
and the non-poor, and between orphans
and non-orphan children, is large, cash
transfers conditional on children attending
school seem appropriate. Innovative
programs along these lines are just begin-
ning (as in Swaziland).

tion  through  impacts  on  innovation, pro-
ductivity, and social cohesion. But there are
big  challenges  to  equitable  provisioning—
getting  the  relevant  issues  on  the  policy
agenda, ﬁghting political capture of institu-
tions  so  that  they  do  not  only  serve  the
powerful and the inﬂuential, and managing
efﬁciency-equity tradeoffs, especially in the
short  term. There  are  also  good  prospects
for  incremental  change  through  advocacy
to  point  out  long-run  beneﬁts  even  when
there  are  short-run  costs, through  sound
program  and  tax  design  to  minimize  efﬁ-
ciency costs and build accountability struc-
tures, and  through  political  coalitions  that
can thwart elite holdups.

The  power  of greater  equity  in  human
capacities  to  unhinge  inequality  traps  is
tremendous—through  directly  contribut-
ing to leveling the economic, political, and
sociocultural  playing  ﬁelds. But  achieving
greater  equity  in  human  capacity  is  not
enough  to  break  the  inequality  trap. It
needs to be complemented with fairness in
the  returns  to  those  capacities  and  in  the
access to complementary assets, topics dis-
cussed in the next chapter.

It takes more than building human capacities
to  broaden  people’s  opportunities. People
also need complementary assets, access to the
marketplace, and  security  of person  and
property. This chapter starts with a descrip-
tion of justice systems, showing how critical
they are in ensuring a level playing ﬁeld and
fair  returns. It  then  turns  to  policies  for
expanding access to the complementary assets
of land  and  infrastructure. Promoting  fair-
ness in markets is addressed in chapter 9.

Building equitable justice systems 
Society’s  rules, and  the  institutions  that
establish, maintain, and  transform  them,
govern market and nonmarket interactions.
They determine people’s endowments, their
rights  and  obligations, and  their  ability  to
generate  fair  returns. Reﬂecting  and  pro-
ducing  the  distribution  of power  among
groups, good institutions (so necessary for
prosperity) emerge only when the distribu-
tion  of political  power  and  enforceable
rights is equitable.

Legal institutions play a key role in the dis-
tribution  of power  and  rights. They  also
underpin  the  forms  and  functions  of other
institutions  that  deliver  public  services  and
regulate market practices. Justice systems can
provide a vehicle to mediate conﬂict, resolve
disputes, and  sustain  social  order. But
inequitable  justice  systems  may  perpetuate
inequality traps by maintaining or reproduc-
ing  elite  interests  and  discriminatory  prac-
tices. Equitable justice systems are thus cru-
cial to sustained equitable development.

Building  more  equitable  justice  systems
runs  into  three  main  challenges—often
interrelated  and  reinforcing. First,
legal
institutions may be open to capture by elite
interests or may discriminate against certain
groups. Second, these institutions are often

inaccessible, because  they  are  incompatible
with local norms and customs and they are
physically  or  economically  inaccessible, or
because people lack the knowledge or capac-
ity  to  navigate  the  system. Third, elite
capture  and  the  inaccessibility  of the  legal
system  may  mean  that  policies  relating  to
crime  and  personal  security  are  inequitable
and perpetuate crime-related inequality traps.

Combating elite capture 
and discrimination 
Political  and  economic  elite  interests  often
coincide at the expense of a disempowered
majority. When power is in the hands of a
narrow elite, the rights of most citizens are
unstable. A  century  of banking  in  Mexico,
outlined in chapter 6, illustrates how deals
between the political and economic elite led
to  the  establishment  of banking  monopo-
lies  and  laws  that  maintained  a  system  of
rent-sharing  between  banks  and  govern-
ments.1 Another  striking  example  of elite
capture comes from the transition economies
and the rise of oligarchs who manipulated
politicians  and  shaped  institutions  to  get
rich.2 Legal  systems  that  cater  to  narrow
interests  also  tend  to  discriminate  against
other groups through inequitable laws and
practices.

Ensuring  equality  before  the  law  and
securing both personal and property rights
for a broad section of the community give
individuals the incentive and the opportu-
nity to take part in economic and political
life. This  requires  an  independent  and
accountable  judiciary  and  laws  and  prac-
tices that protect citizen’s rights in a nondis-
criminatory way.

law system—administered by multiple arms
of government—constrains political power.3
In this system, an independent judiciary acts
as  a  safeguard  against  abuses  of state  and
nonstate power. Because judges are also open
to elite capture and corruption, accountabil-
ity mechanisms are a key aspect of legitimate
judicial independence.4

In  many  developing  countries,

shifts
toward  an  accountable  and  independent
judiciary  require  a  change  in  culture  and
institutional practice. Ethiopia established an
independent  judiciary  for  the  ﬁrst  time  in
1995.5 In  Vietnam  “telephone  justice” was
common, with party elites habitually contact-
ing  judges  to  direct  decisions.6 Changing
ingrained  institutional  practices  in  both
countries has been a slow process. Poor con-
ditions of judicial service in many countries
can  increase  corruption.7 For  example, low
remuneration for magistrates in Kenya made
them  open  to  alternative  funding  for  their
services; Kenya removed almost one-third of
judicial staff for corruption in 2004.8

Promoting judicial independence with-
out  establishing  accountability  mecha-
nisms can further entrench elite interests.
Institutional safeguards, transparency, and
the existence of a civic constituency are key
to  both  accountability  mechanisms  and
judicial  independence. Institutional  safe-
guards  include  providing  for  security  of
tenure  and  improving  conditions  of serv-
ice  for  judges; rigorous  and  transparent
appointment  and  disciplinary  processes;
transparent mechanisms of case allocation
and  case  management; transparent  and
open hearings; appeal rights and the publi-
cation  of
judicial  decisions; and  public
information  about  the  courts.9 Many
countries  have  enshrined  judicial  inde-
pendence  in  the  constitution  or  state
laws.10 Bolivia  has  established  open  com-
petitions  for  judgeships  and  ethical  stan-
dards for judges. Courts in the Philippines
have  a  performance  management  system
for judicial and nonjudicial personnel.

Public  information  campaigns  can  en-
hance  the  independence  and  accountability
of the courts, increasing public conﬁdence in
and commitment to the system, and enhanc-
ing people’s capacity to demand better gov-
ernance and hold those in positions of power

accountable. In  Colombia  public  informa-
tion  centers  in  major  courts  disseminate
information and help people use the court.
In Venezuela information is provided to the
public  through  an  Internet-based  judicial
portal for the Supreme Tribunal.11

Strengthening  the  relationship  among
civil society, the media, and the courts has
also improved public awareness and scrutiny
of the  judicial  system. Bad  judges  have
resigned  because  of high-pressure  media
campaigns,
such  as  the  recent  media
scrutiny in the Philippines.12 The media can
also  disseminate  information, such  as  the
“My  Rights” television  show  in  Armenia
(box  8.1). Similar  shows  have  been  devel-
oped  in  other  parts  of Eastern  Europe. In
Georgia, an  NGO  disseminating  informa-
tion about the courts increased public satis-
faction with the courts.

The  existence  of an  independent  and
accountable judiciary is not enough to pro-
tect  citizens  against  abuses  of state  power.
Adequate  laws  and  institutional  mecha-
nisms  are  also  needed. In  Thailand, for
example,
separate  administrative  courts
were established for the ﬁrst time in 2001 to
protect  citizens  against  arbitrary  uses  of
state power. The courts aim to ensure that

Increasing legal literacy and public awareness:
“My Rights” on Armenian public television

Many people in Armenia have no understand-
ing of the legal system or the rights afforded
them under the law.And distrust of the courts
is widespread.In a recent public awareness
campaign,the government funded a televi-
sion show to provide citizens with examples,
advice,and information on their legal rights.

“My Rights”uses mock trials to depict

real-life disputes in Armenian courts.The tel-
evision judge is a deputy minister of justice,
and the parties are often those in the real
dispute.The topics—such as rental and prop-
erty disputes, customs issues, and family law
matters—are timely and of broad interest. A
live studio audience of judges, lawyers, legal
ofﬁcials, and others discusses the trials on air.

The show airs once a week on Armenia’s
state television channel. After only ﬁve or six
shows,“My Rights” became the number one
show in Armenia.There have been numer-
ous reports of viewers requesting legal doc-
uments and decisions from notaries, judges,
and other legal ofﬁcials based on what they
learned from the show. And when the
power went out in one village a few
minutes before “My Rights” was going on
the air, the people in the town marched on
the mayor’s ofﬁce and accused the local
ofﬁcials of intentionally cutting the power
so that people could not watch the show!

B O X   8 . 2 Afﬁrmative action in India and the United States

The affirmative action program in India is
based primarily on caste and gender and
that in the United States primarily on race.
Before independence in India, the British
government introduced affirmative action
to address discrimination against
“untouchable” castes (now known as Dal-
its) and “tribals” (now known as Adivasis).
After independence in 1947 the policy of
reserving 22.5 percent of seats in educa-
tion institutions, government jobs and
electoral seats was written into the consti-
tution. Since 1991, a further 27 percent
quota has been introduced for other low
castes (called Other Backward Castes), but
with no constitutional guarantee. And
since 1993, 33 percent of the seats in local
governments have been reserved for
women, Dalits, and Adivasis (Deshpande
2005).

In the United States, slavery was perva-

sive for more than two centuries, and not
until 1866 were blacks granted citizenship
rights.The system that replaced slavery was
only marginally better, with several features
similar to the Indian caste system: segrega-
tion, denial of education, restrictions to low-
paid, menial jobs, social and economic dis-
crimination, negative stereotyping, and
violence.The Civil Rights Act of 1964 and
subsequent legislation, Supreme Court rul-
ings, and executive orders in the 1970s intro-
duced afﬁrmative action into the political,
judicial, administrative, and economic
spheres of American society. Starting with
the label “equal opportunity,”selection pro-
cedures incorporate compensatory correc-
tion to ensure adequate representation of

minorities in education and employment
(Deshpande 2005).

The programs in both countries have
become centerpieces of political battles
over race and caste. Critics argue that they
tend to beneﬁt the upper echelon of minor-
ity groups, and they are difﬁcult to end. In
India, the programs are said to apply to sub-
castes that have not traditionally faced dis-
crimination (Sowell 2004).They may also
reinforce negative stereotypes by placing
minorities in positions they are not qualiﬁed
for (Coate and Loury 1993). Despite these
weaknesses, India’s program has provided
formal sector employment and higher edu-
cation for many Dalit and Adivasi families,
freeing them from subservient roles.With
the reservations in local government,
elected women leaders make decisions in
line with women’s needs (Chattopadhyay
and Duﬂo 2004). Low-caste representatives
in state assemblies increase the allocation of
quota-based jobs to low-caste constituents
(Pande 2003). And Dalit representatives in
village government improve the targeting of
beneﬁts to Dalits (Besley and others 2004).

In the United States, disparities between
blacks and whites continue to be signiﬁcant
on all economic indicators, and there is evi-
dence of discriminatory gaps in earnings.
But afﬁrmative action in jobs has increased
black employment and enrollment in
higher education (Holzer and Neumark
2000, Bowen and Bok 1998). But the U.S.
program’s quasi-voluntary element means
that litigation can dilute the program, and
black representation in government bodies
continues to be very low.

tage may mean, however, that legal equality is
not enough. Some countries have passed laws
that discriminate in favor of certain groups,
creating  afﬁrmative  action  programs  on  the
basis of race, ethnicity, and gender or for peo-
ple with disabilities. An assessment of two of
the  most  widely  implemented  afﬁrmative
action  programs, in  India  and  the  United
States, suggests mixed impacts (box 8.2).

The  mere  existence  of “equitable  laws”
for  afﬁrmative  action  does  not  guarantee
their equitable implementation or enforce-
ment. For example, in Peru and Honduras,
gender discrimination in judicial decisions
and treatment by police and judges discour-
age women from using the system to resolve
disputes.13 Such  disadvantaged  groups  are
more likely to experience the law-and-order
side of the law than the protection of their
rights (as discussed below under crime and
personal security).

Making justice accessible
People’s legal rights remain theoretical if the
institutions charged with enforcing them are
inaccessible. Accessibility  depends  on  how
compatible  laws  are  with  the  norms  and
understandings  that  shape  people’s  lives.
Legal  institutions  need  to  be  physically  and
economically  accessible  and  people  need  to
have  the  knowledge  and  capacity  to  claim
their rights.

Addressing  the  compatibility  of state  and
customary  justice  systems. Forms  of cus-
tomary  or  nonstate 
in  a
majority  of countries.14 Yet  they  are  often
neglected  in  justice  sector  reform  policies.
Engaging  with  customary  systems  is  an
important  part  of equitable  reform  strate-
gies for two main reasons. First, customary
law  is  often  a  fundamental  part  of a  com-
munity’s identity and belief system; thus, a
lack of recognition can be intrinsically dis-
criminatory and serve to exclude communi-
ties from the wider state system. Second, a
failure  to  engage  with  customary  systems
may leave inequitable and inefﬁcient prac-
tices at the local level unchecked.

Where  state  and  nonstate  systems  have
developed  in  tandem, they  often  comple-
ment  each  other  and  reinforce  socially
accepted codes and rules. But in communi-

ties where the state systems lack legitimacy
and  political  reach, customary  systems
often act independently from the state legal
system, which may be rejected, ignored, or
not understood. Real difﬁculties arise when
local  customary  systems  are  at  odds  with
the rights and responsibilities articulated in
state law.

In  many  developing  countries, custom-
ary systems are the dominant form of regu-
lation  and  dispute  resolution. In  Sierra
Leone, about 85 percent of the population
fell under customary law as of 2003.15 Cus-
tomary  tenure, discussed  below, affects  90
percent  of land  transactions  in  Mozam-
bique  and  Ghana.16 Customary 
justice
depends  on  local  traditions, as  well  as  the
political  history  of a  country  or  region.
Ethiopia ofﬁcially recognizes more than 100
distinct “nations or peoples” and more than
75 languages.

Customary systems can be incompatible
with  economic, social, and  civil  rights.
Many  forms  of customary  law  are  seen  to
discriminate  against  marginal  groups. In
much  of Sub-Saharan Africa, for  example,
customary  systems  systematically  deny
women’s rights to land, assets, or opportu-
nities.17 Customary  practices  are  also  seen
as  archaic  and  rigid—not  amenable  to
modernization, efﬁcient  market  relations,
or  broader  development  goals. They  are
often seen as overly localized and complex,
making more generalized reform initiatives
difﬁcult. They  can  lack  legitimacy  at  the
local  level. For  example, many  systems  in
Sub-Saharan Africa have been substantially
distorted by colonial rule, which often used
local chiefs to maintain control and estab-
lished more authoritarian and ethnic-based
structures than previously existed.18

However, it is wrong to presume that all
customary  law  discriminates  against  mar-
ginalized groups—or that western law does
not. For example, in the AmaHlubi commu-
nity  of KwaZulu  Natal  Province  in  South
Africa, women  and  men  are  considered
equal, with both entitled to own property.19
Furthermore, there  are  often  good  reasons
for people to choose to use customary sys-
tems. The state systems may lack legitimacy
or be seen as mechanisms of control used by
oppressive regimes. Or the state systems may

lack  capacity, be  inaccessible, or  dramati-
cally  increase  transaction  costs.20 In  rural
Tanzania, a perception that state institutions
can not supply law and order has led to the
emergence of “new” forms of organized vil-
lage  defense  groups  called  sungusungu.
While technically illegal, the sungusungu are
often  informally  supported  by  the  state,
given their success in reducing crime.21

Ignoring or trying to stamp out custom-
ary practices can also have serious negative
implications. Top-down reform can under-
mine informal institutions without provid-
ing viable alternatives, and the vacuum can
lead to power grabbing, lawlessness, or even
violent  conﬂict. When  neither  formal  nor
informal  mechanisms  are 
functioning,
human  rights  abuses  and  serious  conﬂict
are  more  likely. For  example, a  study  in
rural Columbia found the incidence of vigi-
lantism, “mob justice,” or lynching to be ﬁve
and a half times greater in communities in
which informal mechanisms are no longer
functioning  effectively  and  the  state  pres-
ence remains limited.22

A  failure  to  engage  with  customary
systems  may  mean  that  discriminatory
practices  go  unchallenged. While  state  law
ofﬁcially  protects  women’s  rights  in  many
countries, local norms and power structures
continue  to  make  it  almost  impossible  for
women to claim these rights.

Considered  attention  to  customary  sys-
tems in broader institutional reform is fairly
new. But many governments, such as South
Africa, have  begun  working  toward  inte-
grating  customary  institutions  into  wider
state  frameworks  (box  8.3).23 Many  coun-
tries have attempted to integrate customary
land  systems  into  formal  land  law  systems
(box  8.7). Local  NGOs  and  community
groups have also helped empower marginal
groups  to  challenge  discriminatory  norms
at the local level.

Establishing adequate and open legal insti-
tutions. Even  when  formal  systems  do
exist, they  often  lack  adequate  infrastruc-
ture or are so institutionally weak that citi-
zens cannot claim their rights. Formal insti-
tutions  may  exist  only  in  large  cities, and
even  then  excessive  delays, unfair  proce-
dures, or  unreasonable  costs  may  leave

B O X   8 . 3 State frameworks and customary institutions 

in South Africa

The coexistence of various ofﬁcial state laws
in South Africa began as early as the 1830s
when chiefs in Cape Colony were granted
authority to enforce indigenous law (sub-
ject to review by a colonial ofﬁcial).24 At the
end of the apartheid era there were approx-
imately 800 ofﬁcially recognized traditional
communities and traditional leaders, 12,000
headmen, and 12 kings.

Since 1994, South Africa has worked

toward bringing traditional systems into the
state framework.Traditional institutions and
laws are all ofﬁcially recognized in the 1996
constitution. After a long political process,
the national Traditional Leadership and Gov-
ernance Framework Act was promulgated in
2004, setting out the roles and responsibili-
ties of different levels of traditional leaders
and institutions, and their relationships to
the different levels of government.

Many celebrated the constitutional and

administrative recognition of customary
law, but there clearly are difﬁculties.
Customary practices have been criticized as
incompatible with rights in the constitution
and the new South African Bill of Rights.25
Of 800 traditional leaders recognized by
the state in South Africa, only one is female.
In an attempt to deal with this, the state
issued a regulation in early 2005 that
female participation must be at 30 percent
by the end of the year, but there is no con-
sensus on how this might be achieved. Rec-
ognizing the difﬁcult task of effectively
integrating the different systems, the South
African model aims at “progressive align-
ment” with the constitution.

B O X   8 . 4 The impact of legal aid in Ecuador

As in much of the rest of the world,
Ecuador’s poor face numerous barriers in
using the legal system.Women considering
claims against their former spouses may
face an added obstacle: physical violence.
As part of a larger judicial reform effort,

three local NGOs—Centro Ecuatoriano para la
Promoción y Acción de la Mujer,Corporación
Mujer a Mujer,and Fundación María Guare—
provide legal information and representation
as well as psychological counseling and refer-
rals to shelters.A survey in 2002 revealed that
women’s use of legal aid clinics reduced the
probability of severe physical violence after
separation by 17 percent.Legal aid clients also

attained better legal and economic results
than nonclients,raising their chances of
obtaining a child-support award by 20
percent and their chances of receiving a child-
support payment by 10 percent.

Receiving assistance from the legal aid
clinics also had intergenerational impacts.
Child-support payments increased the prob-
ability of the child attending school (by 4.8
percent) as did the lower incidence of vio-
lence. Anecdotal evidence also suggests that
the payments, a small but important source
of family income, were used to pay for food.

them inaccessible to much of the commu-
nity. 26 Institutions can also be inaccessible
if people do not know their rights and can-
not navigate the systems charged with pro-
tecting them.

A large array of information campaigns
has  informed  citizens  about  their  rights
(discussed above). But even if people know
their rights, they may have limited capacity
to navigate the system. Access to legal serv-
ices  is  often  restricted  or  costly. In  Hon-
duras,
legal  fees  to  obtain  a  monthly
alimony  of 100  lempiras  (US$5.30)  in  a

child-support  case  could  amount  to  as
much  as  2,000  lempiras  (US$106.00), or
almost two years of alimony. Adding to the
costs are requirements that parties be repre-
sented by lawyers. For example, most Latin
American  countries  do  not  permit  self-
representation, effectively  denying  access
based  on  economic  status. Legal  aid  can
increase people’s access to basic legal services
and the courts (box 8.4). So can community
mediation  centers, lay  judges, and  mobile
courts. The  mobile  courts  introduced  in
remote  areas  of Brazil  in  1999  have  been
replicated in the Philippines and Mexico. In
Guatemala, 24 mediation centers have been
created, employing  mediators  ﬂuent 
in
Spanish and local Mayan languages.27

In  some  situations, social  movements
provide  the  support  for  people  to  use  the
courts and claim their formal rights, as with
the  landless  peasant  movements  in  Brazil
and Mexico. In Argentina, too, unemployed
factory  workers  have  occupied  closed  fac-
tory sites and pursued their rights through
the  courts  and  the  legislative  process. In
other cases, civil society organizations have
assisted groups in claiming their rights—as
in  the  “right  to  health” cases  discussed  in
chapter 10.

Civil  unrest  and  conﬂict  may  further
weaken legal institutions. In Sierra Leone, a
decade of civil war left the justice system in
shambles: courthouses were destroyed, and
judges,
lawyers, and  police  ofﬁcers  were
killed or forced to ﬂee. During the conﬂict
in Liberia, more than three-quarters of the
population left their homes.28 In Bosnia, 2.3
million  people—more  than  half the  coun-
try’s  population—ﬂed  their  homes  during
and  immediately  after  the  war. To  prevent
the  return  of minorities, many  property
records were destroyed or tampered with.

Reestablishing  legitimate  legal  institu-
tions  is  crucial  to  restoring  such  people’s
personal and property rights and enhancing
conﬁdence in newly established governance
structures. In  postwar  Bosnia, the  Dayton
Agreement established the Commission for
Real Property Claims of Displaced Persons
and  Refugees, which  collected  claims  for
318,780 properties. As of June 2003, it had
issued  about  290,000  ﬁnal  decisions  on
property titles.29

Improving crime and personal
security policies—breaking 
crime-related inequality traps
The cycle of inequality, crime, victimization,
and discrimination exempliﬁes the processes
by which inequality traps, outlined in chapter
2, are  perpetuated. Marginal  groups  are  not
only  more  likely  to  move  into  criminal
behavior, they are also more likely to be vic-
tims  of crime. Furthermore, discriminatory
practices in the justice sector mean that mar-
ginal groups are more likely to experience the
law-and-order side of the legal system—black
men in the United States are incarcerated on
drug charges at a rate 13.4 times that of white
men, bearing  little  relation  to  differences  in
offenses30—and are less likely to have access
to institutions charged with protecting them.
At the same time, given their role in shaping
these  processes,
legal  institutions  are  also
places for change—that is, vehicles for chal-
lenging inequality traps.

Breaking the cycle of inequality, crime, and
violence. Traditional  approaches  to  reduc-
ing crime and violence based on increasing
mechanisms  of control  and  harsher  sanc-
tions  have  failed  to  reduce  crime. By  con-
trast, promoting  protective  strategies  and
minimizing  the  risk  of crime  have  more
success at lower cost.31

To  target  the  many  risk  factors  of in-
creased  crime, crime  prevention  programs
often  require  support  from  the  judicial
services, social  services, health, education,
media, police, local government, civil soci-
ety  organizations, and  the  private  sector
(box  8.5). Local  governments  and  police
services often coordinate such programs.32
Many  more  effective  interventions  tar-
get children and adolescents, who are seen
as particularly at risk of falling into crimi-
nal  behavior.33 Preventative  interventions
include family support and parenting skills
programs, early  childhood  development
programs, special  needs  programs, after-
school  care, antibullying  programs,
life
skills and cultural programs, and commu-
nity participation programs.34

School-based  interventions  have  targeted
youth crime and have kept young people in
schools in many countries.35 Tilsa Thuto is a

B O X   8 . 5 Bogota, Colombia: civic culture program

Unlike most Colombian cities, Bogota—a city
previously considered unsafe and violent—
has seen a huge reduction in crime since the
early 1990s and a substantial increase in citi-
zen perception of safety.

The city’s administration targeted civic
culture and education, urban planning and
safety, and the regeneration of public spaces.
Individual and community behavior were
changed by establishing a citizen disarma-
ment program; restricting alcohol consump-
tion and use of ﬁreworks; increasing the
number of social service centers; enhancing
awareness through media campaigns and
educational programs; preventing domestic
violence and child abuse; strengthening the
capacity of the police and the judiciary to
deal with crime, violence, and victimization;

enhancing neighborhood watch programs;
and revitalizing urban public spaces. Employ-
ment and educational programs were intro-
duced to support populations most at risk.
No longer one of the most dangerous

cities in the western hemisphere, Bogota has
seen remarkable results.The homicide rate
fell from 80 per 100,000 inhabitants in 1993
to 22 in 2004, with homicides related to
intoxication falling dramatically. By 2001,
6,500 weapons had been turned in and gun
conﬁscations fell from 6,000 in 1995 to 1,600
in 2003. Arrests for homicide, assault, and car
theft rose by 500 percent between 1994 and
2003 (with no increase in police personnel).

mented in 42 schools in Soweto, South Africa,
in  2000, in  areas  known  for  high  levels  of
crime, unemployment, and  poverty.36 The
program—established  in  partnership  with
the  department  of education, community
organizations, and local police—creates safer
schools  through  the  active  participation  of
students, teachers, parents, school  adminis-
trators, and the local community in different
training  modules. Both  teacher  and  student
attendance  at  school  increased  by  some  70
percent, acts of violence and aggression fell by
67 percent, and the pass rate increased by an
average of 78 percent.

Alternative  ways  of dealing  with  young
offenders have also been effective in break-
ing the cycle of crime. Interventions include
diversion programs, restorative justice, alter-
native  sentencing, and  reintegration  proj-
ects. Diversion  programs  aim  to  move
young  offenders  into  welfare-based  pro-
grams, as  with  attempts  in  Africa  to  keep
street children out of prison. Restorative jus-
tice  programs, such  as  community  confer-
encing, mediate between offenders and those
affected by the crime, helping to reintegrate
young  offenders  into  their  communities.
Noncustodial  sentencing, such  as  commu-
nity service orders, is used in different parts
of Africa today to promote the reintegration
and rehabilitation of offenders.37

Increasing personal safety. Appropriate and

are crucial. Violence against women, a huge
problem in many parts of the world, is exac-
erbated by underreporting, inadequate sup-
port  systems  for  victims, discriminatory
practices  within  justice  sector  institutions,
and the lack of adequate sanctions for perpe-
trators. Many  governments  have  attempted
to address the problem by introducing more
severe  sentences  for  perpetrators, establish-
ing  remedial  programs  for  offenders, and
running  gender-sensitive  training  programs
for police and the judiciary.

More  recently, some  countries, includ-
ing  Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Peru, and
Uruguay, have set up women’s police stations.
Other  countries  have  set  up  police  cells  for
women in regular police stations. These serv-
ices  have  shown  mixed  results.38 Women’s
police  stations  have  increased  reporting  of
abuse  and  the  likelihood  that  women  will
receive medical and social services. But critics
argue  that  services  encourage  regular  police
to  abdicate  responsibility  for  crimes  against
women  and  that  women  ofﬁcers  have  not
necessarily  demonstrated  better  attitudes
toward  victims  of violence. Where  stations
are working fairly well, their efforts are often
undermined by other parts of the justice sys-
tem, as prosecution rates remain unchanged.
The notion that the physical environment
can increase personal safety has been an inte-
gral  part  of many  recent  crime  prevention
strategies,39 and  it  has  been  applied  to  city-
planning, public transport systems, parks and
recreational spaces, low-income housing, and
downtown areas where people feel most vul-
nerable to violence and crime.40

Toward greater equity 
in access to land
Land is a key asset for poor people. Owning
it  provides  a  means  of livelihood  to  many,
facilitates  access  to  credit  markets, has  an
insurance  value, determines  inﬂuence  in
local politics, permits participation in social
networks, and  inﬂuences  intrahousehold
dynamics. That is why inequality in the own-
ership  of land  has  such  far-reaching  conse-
quences  for  the  distribution  of well-being
and  the  organization  of society  for  genera-
tions  to  come. Yet  landownership  in  many
countries  is  highly  unequal, substantially
more  so  than  income  or  consumption.

Building on chapters 5 and 6, we argue here
that  there  are  strong  equity  and  efﬁciency
reasons  for  addressing  inequalities  in  land
distribution—both  rural  and  urban—and
then discuss the experience with land reform
and  options  for  broadening  access  to  land:
providing security of tenure, improving the
functioning  of
land  markets, and  imple-
menting cost-effective land redistribution.

Equity and efﬁciency reasons 
to address inequalities 
in land distribution
Inequalities  in  landownership  in  dozens  of
countries can be traced to interventions over
the  past  500  years  to  establish  and  support
large farms at the expense of indigenous peo-
ples  and  the  local  peasantry. This  historical
discrimination  against  certain  groups—or
more  generally  a  lack  of legitimacy  for  the
prevailing  pattern  of landownership—offers
a  rationale  for  equity-enhancing  reforms.
Additional  motivation  comes  from  the  fact
that  the  landless  are  among  the  poorest  in
developing countries.41

Access  to  land  can  give  the  poor  more
voice in the political arena and can lead to
higher  investments  in  children’s  education,
arresting the intergenerational transmission
of poverty. Galasso and Ravallion (2005), in
their study of the Food for Education pro-
gram in Bangladesh, ﬁnd that villages with
more  unequal  distribution  of
land  were
worse  at  targeting  the  poor. This  is  consis-
tent  with  the  view  that  land  inequality  is
associated  with  less  power  for  the  poor  in
village decision making. Land inequality has
also  been  found  to  impair  the  ability  of
communities  to  engage  in  socially  optimal
collective action, resulting in the underpro-
visioning of public goods. It also contributes
to social tensions that can lead to consider-
able upheaval, as in Southern Africa.42

Inequalities in landownership can weigh
particularly heavily on women. Land rights
(and  control  of other  assets)  often  reside
with  the  head  of household, which  has
implications 
intrafamily  bargaining
power  and  control  of resources. Women
with  secure  land  rights  (including  inheri-
tance on the death of a husband) are more
likely  to  engage  in  independent  economic
activity, a result that has positive economic

for 

and equity implications for the household.
Inheritance rights that disadvantage women
are  of particular  concern  in  Africa, where
they are often based on customary institu-
tions 
that  conﬂict  with  constitutional
norms  and  international  conventions  on
women’s rights. In fact, insecure inheritance
rights pose an additional burden on widows
who  lose  their  husbands, often  through
HIV/AIDS.43

There  are  strong  efﬁciency  reasons  to
address  inequalities  in  land  distribution.
Pervasive imperfections in land and ﬁnan-
cial markets in developing countries reduce
investment in land and keep countries from
efﬁcient land allocations (chapter 5). These
effects—together with lower human capital
investment, reduced  social  cohesion, and
distorted  political  power—are  consistent
with  a  positive  association  between  more
unequal  land  distribution  and  lower  GDP

Experience with land reform
The  discussion  here  implies  that  redistrib-
uting  land  could  enhance  equity  and  efﬁ-
ciency. This is likely to be true, but there are
signiﬁcant hurdles in practice. For instance,
the  specter  of land  redistribution  can  also
worsen  efﬁciency, because  farmers  are
reluctant  to  invest  in  land  that  they  might
lose. Or  political  imperatives  can  override
sound  program  design. Successful  land
reforms—such as in Japan, the Republic of
Korea, and  Taiwan, China—are  rare  and
often  associated  with  exceptional  events,
such  as  war  or  political  upheaval. Indeed,
the history of land reforms is littered with
partial successes and failures.

In  India, abolishing  the  land  rights  of
rent-collecting  intermediaries45 has  been
highly  successful, whereas  the  implementa-
tion  of landownership  ceilings  and  laws  to
protect  tenants  was, with  few  exceptions,
half-hearted. The absence of political leader-
ship has been identiﬁed as the “prime reason
for the poor implementation of land reforms
in India.”46 Still, where tenant protection was
implemented  seriously—primarily  in  West
Bengal—it  helped  improve  productivity.47
But restrictions on subleasing land by beneﬁ-
ciaries (or their children) tend to reduce the
scope for productivity-enhancing land trans-

inequality  of

fers. And the fact that both tenants and land-
lords  have  rights  to  the  same  plot  of land
severely undermines investment incentives.48
In Latin America, where the potential for
land reform should have been highest given
the  high 
landownership,
reforms  have  generally  been  “incomplete.”
Beneﬁciaries  have  often  lacked  the  tools  to
become  competitive  and, as  a  result, the
impact on poverty has been disappointing.49
In Kenya and Zimbabwe, postindependence
reforms were quite effective but short lived
for  political  reasons.50 In  South  Africa, the
government’s  land  redistribution  program
in the late 1990s fell way short of its targets
but  recently  gathered  steam  (box  8.6).
Clearly, both the politics of land reform and
its implementation are complex.

Why  the  rather  disappointing  results
from  attempts  at  land  reform?  First, given
that the motivation for land reform is often
to  address  political  grievances, efﬁciency
and poverty reduction tend to be secondary.
Guided  by  short-term  political  objectives,
bureaucrats often targeted high-productiv-
ity  areas  rather  than  high-potential  areas,
resulting in costly land acquisition and lim-
ited 
sustained  productivity
impacts. Central administration of the pro-
grams also often meant that a large portion
of land  reform  budgets  was  spent  on  the

B O X   8 . 6 Land reform in South Africa: picking up steam

To redress apartheid-era asset inequality,
South Africa embarked on land reform in
1994 with a program that rested on redistri-
bution, restitution, and tenure.Targets for
redistribution were ambitious: the govern-
ment aimed to transfer 24 million hectares
of agricultural land (30 percent of the total)
to about 3 million people between 1994
and 1999. Under the program, self-selected
groups use grants to purchase land from
willing sellers and to invest in the land’s
development. But by February 2005, only
about 3.5 million hectares had been redis-
tributed to 168,000 households. Restitution
proceeded at a snail’s pace—only 41 of
79,000 claims were settled between 1995
and 1999. And progress on tenure in the for-
mer “homelands” was equally slow.

After this sluggish start, some key

changes accelerated the restitution and
redistribution programs.The Restitution Act
was amended to allow for negotiated settle-
ments, speeding the process considerably;
previously all claims had to be settled in
court. By March 2005, more than 58,000
claims were settled, and all claims are sched-
uled to be resolved by March 2008.
The redistribution program was

improved in 2001, making it more ﬂexible
and decentralized.The grants for land
purchase and farm development now follow
a sliding scale, depending on the contribu-
tion by the beneﬁciaries, and can be obtained

by individuals as well as groups.Approval
authority is now delegated from the minister
to the provincial directors of land affairs.As a
result, redistribution has signiﬁcantly
increased.For the ﬁrst time since 1994, land
delivery is now constrained only by the
budget for it.

But some big challenges remain.Pressure

is growing from civil society on government
to meet the revised target of redistributing 30
percent of agricultural land by 2014.Restitu-
tion settlements can be complex when rural
claims target highly productive, capital-inten-
sive farms and the claimants refuse, as is their
right, to accept ﬁnancial compensation,
instead of the physical restoration of the
claimed land.The agricultural impact of the
redistribution scheme has been stunted by
an inappropriate emphasis on collective
farming and a lack of beneﬁciary power in
decision making.The land market continues
to be biased against family farming through
costly restrictions on subdividing agricultural
land and a regressive land tax dating from
1939.A new land tax based on the value of
unimproved agricultural land could provide
incentives for large farms to sell unused or
underused parcels.New legislation that trans-
fers communal lands from state to commu-
nity ownership is now in place, but it still
needs to be implemented.

Klerk, and Binswanger (1996).

wages  and  salaries  of civil  servants  rather
than used to beneﬁt the poor. The prospect
of gaining  access  to  valuable  real  estate,
instead  of having  to  put  in  sweat  equity  to
develop a piece of land, undermined the self-
targeting  properties  of reform  programs,
often politicizing beneﬁciary selection.

Second, the  relationship  between  farm
size and productivity depends on the type of
crop, quality  of land, degree  of mechaniza-
tion, and such associated factors as market-
ing and credit. For most crops, under normal
availability  of mechanical  services, produc-
tion  is  neutral  to  farm  size. But  when
management  requirements  are  substantial
(labor-intensive  crops, erratic  weather  con-
ditions,
incidence)  family
farms—as  opposed  to  larger, wage-labor
farms—can  be  more  efﬁcient  because  of
advantages in supervising labor. By contrast,
large farms often have better access to input
and output markets, ﬁnancing, and technical

frequent  pest 

assistance. Such advantages can be countered
if small  farmers  coordinate  their  efforts
through  cooperatives.51 If policymakers  do
not properly account for all these conditions
in land reform schemes, efﬁciency can suffer.
Third, many  traditional  land  reform
efforts  failed  to  provide  beneﬁciaries  with
secure  long-term  rights  backed  by  a  well-
functioning  and  equitable  legal  system.
Affordable  channels  to  adjudicate 
land
access and ownership claims must be open
to everyone. Without such channels, disad-
vantaged groups cannot take full advantage
of tenure security, land market, and distrib-
utive reforms. Even with full property rights,
underdeveloped  credit  and  insurance  mar-
kets limit the use of land for collateral.

Fourth, the  full  productivity  beneﬁts  of
land  reform  cannot  be  realized  without
complementary  inputs  and  training; put-
ting  land  in  the  hands  of inexperienced
farmers  without  the  needed  support  often
led to high rates of desertion.52 More gener-
ally, a  broader  rural  development  strategy 
is  required  to  complement  land  reform
because  rural  households  get  their  liveli-
hoods  from  several  different  sources. This
has  implications  for  the  design  of
land
reform  (for  example, determining  viable
farm size) and highlights the importance of
investments  that  can  facilitate  off-farm
employment, such as education.

Broadening access by improving 
the security of tenure
The  beneﬁts  of secure  tenure  for  rural
households are well known: higher produc-
tivity, greater access to credit, higher propen-
sity  to  invest  in  physical  assets  (ﬁgure  8.2)
and the education of children, and time and
effort  saved  in  securing  land  rights.53 Fur-
ther  beneﬁts  arise  from  removing  the  dis-
cretionary  power  of bureaucrats  to  decide
on  the  allocation  of land  (improved  local
governance  was  mentioned  as  a  beneﬁt  of
property  rights  reforms  introduced  after
1992 in Mexico).54

These beneﬁts are observed also in urban
contexts. Capitalizing  on  a  natural  experi-
ment  that  allocated  land  titles  to  some
squatters but not others in a poor suburban
area  of Buenos  Aires, Galiani  and  Schar-
grodsky (2004) found signiﬁcant effects of

titling  on  housing  investment, household
size, and school achievement. The quality of
houses  in  titled  parcels  was  higher. Titled
households  had  fewer  members  (even
though their houses were larger), and they
seemed  to  invest  more  in  their  children’s
education. In India, unclear land titles com-
bined with unreliable courts were found to
limit  the  supply  of land  and  discourage
investments. Southern  states  tend  to  have
higher  tenure  security, which  increases  the
share of modern retailers. Evidence from a
massive  urban  squatter  titling  program  in
Peru  suggests  that  titling  resulted  in  more
work done outside the home and substitu-
tion of adult for child labor.55

in  urban  areas.56

Formal  land  titling  is  one  way  to  pro-
vide  for  secure  tenure, but  titling  takes
time  and  can  be  expensive. Thailand, the
first  country  with  a  national  program,
completed the program this year, 20 years
after its inception. One solution is to allow
alternatives  to  conventional  private  land
titles, especially 
In
Trinidad  and  Tobago, a  1998  law  author-
ized  three  incremental  levels  of statutory
security, each  requiring  additional  docu-
mentation and commitment from the set-
tler  and  the  government. In  one  year, an
estimated  80  percent  of informal  settlers
on  state  land  had  applied  for  the  lowest
level.57 Because many of these instruments
do  not  require  prior  physical  planning,
infrastructure servicing, and surveying of
settlements,
they  can  offer  widespread
coverage at lower costs. The limitations on
transfer  associated  with  many  of
these
instruments  also  check  the  tendency  of
some  informal  dwellers  to  capitalize  land
subsidies immediately through land sales.
Several  countries  have  taken  steps  to
require joint titling of land in the names of
husband  and  wife, bolstering  women’s
effective  right  to  land, particularly  during
their husbands’ absences. Vietnam has tar-
gets for the joint titling of land as part of the
Vietnam Development Goals, incorporated
in its Poverty Reduction Strategy. Attention
to  women’s 
land  rights  is  particularly
important when women are the main culti-
vators, when  out-migration  is  high, when
control of productive activities is differenti-
ated by gender, or when high levels of adult

undermine a woman’s livelihoods in case of
her husband’s death.58

Despite  potentially  large  beneﬁts  from
titling, there  are  challenges  in  urban  and
rural  contexts. In  urban  areas, access  to
credit may not increase if banks are unwill-
ing  to  accept  titled  shanties  in  marginal
areas  as  collateral. And  where  squatters’
land  is  valuable, titling  programs  can  be
subverted by powerful interests who use the
opportunity  to  relocate  squatters  to  mar-
ginal areas—for example, in Phnom Penh,
Cambodia. This does not reﬂect a problem
with  titling  per  se, but  suggests  that  when
the urban poor lack voice and governance is
weak, titling  programs  can  backﬁre.59 One
way  to  protect  squatters  from  predatory
urban  developers  would  be  to  grant  them
group land rights as a ﬁrst step toward indi-
vidual titles. 60

Some  studies  indicate  that  formal  land
titles  in  several  African  countries  did  not
bring  the  expected  beneﬁts 
in  higher
incomes  and  investment. This  may  reﬂect
weaknesses  in  the  institutions  responsible
for  registration  and  recordkeeping  and  for
the adjudication of rights and resolution of
conﬂicts. In  some  cases,
it  appears  that
indigenous  tenure  was  already  sufﬁciently
secure.61 It  may  thus  be  more  appropriate
and  more  cost-effective  to  strengthen  the
security of tenure through institutions that
combine legality with social legitimacy. This

B O X   8 . 7 Clarifying how customary rights ﬁt 

with formal systems 

Customary land tenure is created,
maintained, and protected by norm-based
customary systems at the local level. Rights
to land, whether communal or individual,
are generally based on family lineage or
membership in a particular cultural group-
ing. Exchanges through sales or rentals are
limited to members of the community. Cus-
tomary systems are dominant in most
African countries and in indigenous areas of
many Latin American and Asian countries.
Having evolved over long periods in
response to local conditions, they are often
quite ﬂexible. Problems arise when transfers
to outsiders become widespread or internal
land dispute resolution mechanisms
become inadequate.

There have been many efforts to make
the transition from collective or customary
systems to more individual landholdings. But
the transition, if not properly managed, can
end in disaster, such as in Kenya. Because the
elimination of lineage rights and the legaliza-
tion of land sales were not accepted by rural
populations, conﬂicts over land, sometimes
violent, ensued between those claiming land
under customary norms and those seeking
to enforce the new rules.

Botswana has had more success. Since

1970, the authorities have gradually
strengthened individual rights, starting with
the right to exclude other people’s animals
and to fence arable lands. Common law resi-
dential leases for commercially valuable
land have been introduced, as have laws
allowing the allocation of land to all adult
citizens, whether male or female, married or
single (Adams 2000 and Toulmin and Quan
2000 in World Bank 2003i). South Africa is

just starting down the road to communal
land reform, having recently passed legisla-
tion that will transfer state-owned land to
communities and create democratic, trans-
parent, and secure property rights regimes
in these areas.

Mexico made a hybrid transition from

collective land—known as the ejido
sector—toward more individual landhold-
ings. Ejidos are rural communities modeled
after a mixture of soviet-style collectives
and precolonial indigenous social
structures. Reforms in 1992 strengthened
the self-governance of ejidos, allowing them
to choose a property rights regime. Each
ejido could choose whether land would be
held under communal or individual owner-
ship and issue property rights certiﬁcates
accordingly. By 2001 the program had
issued property certiﬁcates to more than 3
million households and given secure land
rights to more than 1 million households
that previously had no formal recognition
of occupancy rights (World Bank 2001d).
Clarifying how customary rights—in

rural and urban areas—relate to the formal
system of property rights protected
through modern law is important for mil-
lions of people. It is also important for
expanding the scope for outside
investment, particularly in urban areas.
Experience with managing the intersection
between the two systems suggests the
importance of effective dispute resolution
mechanisms and a transparent and well-
deﬁned trajectory for transition, with the
extension of secure landownership rights to
an entire group as an effective and low-cost
ﬁrst step (World Bank 2003i).

approach  is  particularly  pertinent  where
customary  tenure  practices  predominate.
Recognizing  customary  rights  and  institu-
tions in the law helps protect large popula-
tions that are governed by them and builds
a  bridge  to  the  formal  system  (box  8.7).
Clearly, the  complexities  of engaging  with
customary  justice  systems  outlined  earlier
in the chapter need to be considered—and
when  formalizing  customary  rights, care
should be taken not to simply codify exist-
ing inequities, particularly for women.

Broadening  access  by  improving  the  func-
tioning  of
land  markets. Land  markets,
both in sales and rentals, can in theory do

much  to  equalize  land  access. In  practice,
however, land sales/purchases are generally
not an avenue to expand access by the poor
and  may  actually  reduce  it. High  transac-
tion costs, undeveloped credit markets, and
high prices for land, reﬂecting its collateral
value  and  any  government  subsidies  to
crops, lead  to  thin  sales  markets  that  keep
poor  farmers  out  altogether. This  suggests
that land sales markets will not contribute
to greater equity in landholdings, especially
in  settings  characterized  by  long-standing
discrimination  against  speciﬁc  groups,
unless  the  government  relieves  the  savings
constraints  of the  poor  through  subsidies
(as we will see in the next section).62

Distress  sales  of land  by  the  poor  can
occur  in  risky  environments  where  small
landowners do not have access to insurance.
Thus, they  are  unable  to  smooth  consump-
tion  through  mechanisms  other  than  land
sales, such as safety nets.63 In a comparison of
land transactions in Indian and Bangladeshi
villages  during  1960–80, Cain  (1981)  found
that  poor  farmers  who  had  access  to  safety
net  programs  used  the  land  market  to
augment  their  landholdings  and  undertook
productivity-enhancing  investment. Distress
sales to obtain food and medicine predomi-
nated when safety nets were absent.

While  government  interventions  to  im-
pose  restrictions  on  the  transferability  of
land  can  undermine  investment  incentives
and depress off-farm activity, they can play
a  role, especially  during  periods  of transi-
tion. In many Commonwealth of Indepen-
dent States (CIS) countries the unrestricted
transferability  of land  led  to  a  concentra-
tion of landholdings in the hands of a small
number  of farm  bosses, as  poorer  rural
households were enticed to sell their land in
conditions  of uncertainty  and  incomplete
markets  and  information.64 Initially  limit-
ing the transferability of land to lease trans-
actions  rather  than  outright  sales  would
have been better.

A gradual transition may be preferable in
cases  in  which  an  equitable  distribution  of
land  has  been  the  primary  instrument  of
social  protection, as  in  China  and Vietnam.
Governments  in  both  countries  rightly  per-
ceive  the  tensions  in  active  land  sales  mar-
kets, which could lead to efﬁciency-enhancing

consolidation  but  also  run  the  risk  of
increasing the number of landless poor. In
China, the government is considering mov-
ing on several fronts, including developing
safety nets and rural ﬁnance and eliminat-
ing residency-based restrictions (hukou) on
labor mobility.

While land sales markets have ambiguous
impacts on equity, the equity case for broad-
ening  access  to  land  rentals  appears  more
clear-cut. When farmers do not have access to
credit  that  would  enable  them  to  purchase
land  outright, rental  markets  are  an  impor-
tant  avenue  for  enhancing  productivity  and
equity  by  facilitating  low-cost  transfers  of
land to more productive producers (chapter
5). Rental  markets  also  enable  landholders
with  low  agricultural  skills  (or  no  desire  to
farm)  to  seek  employment  in  the  nonfarm
sector  while  still  earning  a  return  on  their
land.65 Evidence  from  Sudan  suggests  that
land  rental  markets  do  transfer  land  to
smaller  producers. And  in  Colombia, rental
markets  have  been  more  effective  than  gov-
ernment-sponsored land reforms in bringing
land to productive and poor producers.66

interventions 

If land  rental  markets  have  so  much
potential to improve equity and efﬁciency,
why  is  there  such  a  large  variation  in  the
incidence of rentals across countries? One
reason  is  a  lack  of tenure  security—or
trust that the security will last. Without it,
landlords  are  unwilling  to  rent  out  their
land  for  fear  that  they  will  not  be  able  to
reclaim  it. Other  reasons  include  current
or  past  government 
to
restrict tenancy, the availability of reliable
conflict  resolution  mechanisms, and  im-
perfections  in  information.67 While  con-
cern  about  exploitation  in  sharecropping
arrangements  may  be  justiﬁed,68 tenant
protection  and  rent  ceilings  can  backﬁre.
Such restrictions on land rentals often push
transactions  into  informality  or  lock  poor
farmers into less efﬁcient and less equitable
wage-labor  arrangements. Estimates  indi-
cate  that  new  tenancy  legislation  in  India
was  associated  with  the  eviction  of more
than 100 million tenants, causing the rural
poor to lose access to about 30 percent of
the  total  operated  area.69 Interventions  to
enhance  the  bargaining  power  of
the
poor—including  better  access  to  ﬁnancial

markets, off-farm employment opportuni-
ties, and  equitable  contract  enforcement
mechanisms—are likely to be preferable.

Well-functioning rental markets can be a
rung in the ownership ladder, but they proba-
bly  are  not  in  circumstances  of extreme
inequality  in  landownership  and  power. In
these instances, options for directly redistrib-
utive policies need to be exploited.

Options for cost-effective land
redistribution to broaden access
Improving  tenure  security  and  promoting
land  rental  markets  are  good  for  both
equity  and  efﬁciency. Analysis  and  experi-
ence indicate that land redistribution is not
nearly as straightforward. It can be costly in
program resources and reduced productiv-
ity, and it can be an instrument of political
patronage. Substantial personnel and ﬁnan-
cial  resources  are  necessary  to  assess  and
purchase (or expropriate) land, select bene-
ﬁciaries, and supply training and credit.

When  does  land  redistribution  make
sense?  In  some  countries, redistribution
could  be  a  necessary  political  step  to
address  historical  inequities  and  stave  off
violence. In others, it could simply be a tool
to shift underused land to more productive
uses  while  enhancing  equity. In  countries
where  state  landownership  is  high,
land
redistribution  could  involve  limited  budg-
etary costs if bundled into a one-time trans-
fer  of state  land  to  private  ownership.
Conversely, in  countries  with  strong  tradi-
tions  of tenure  security, just  the  threat  of
redistribution could undermine investment.
The feasibility of land redistribution also
depends on the instrument. Expropriation is
likely  to  be  the  most  disruptive. Divesting
state  lands  and  recuperating  illegal  settle-
ments may be two cost-effective alternatives.
For  example, the  mayor  of Brasilia  (Brazil)
identiﬁed  lands  with  uncertain  titles  and
negotiated  the  surrender  of part  of those
lands. In exchange, ofﬁcial titles were granted
to  the  remaining  areas. Expropriating  with
compensation  and  assisting  land  purchases
and rentals—for example, through commu-
nity-driven  land  reform—are  also  feasible
alternatives. Subsidizing  land  purchases  can
be costly, however, because land is often over-
priced  relative  to  its  income  generation

potential  from  productive  use  (reﬂecting  its
speculative,
insurance, and  status  value).
Also, subsidies  are  difﬁcult  to  justify  if the
current pattern of landownership is not con-
sidered legitimate.70

to 

Market-  or  community-driven  land  re-
forms  are  a  potential  option. The  reforms
tend  to  be  decentralized  and  transparent,
allowing  community  members  to  obtain
resources for land access. They can be ﬂexi-
ble, allowing  for  land  rental  or  purchase
according 
the  willing-buyer-willing-
seller  principle. Community-driven  land
reforms often give beneﬁciaries full property
rights  and  involve  coordination  between
local  government  and  NGOs  to  provide
access to training, technology, and credit. A
community-driven approach has been tried
in  several  countries,
including  Brazil,
Columbia, Guatemala, Honduras, India,
Malawi, and South Africa. But the programs
are relatively new, so rigorous impact evalu-
ations are not yet available.

A  land  tax, possibly  combined  with  an
output  tax, can  be  an  important  comple-
ment. It can generate revenues to purchase
land to redistribute or encourage redistrib-
ution  by  disproportionately  taxing  large
landholders or owners of unused or under-
used land, both rural and urban (box 8.8).

Regardless  of the  instrument, common
lessons can be drawn from previous attempts
at land redistribution.

and Africa indicates that simply redistrib-

B O X   8 . 8 Land and output tax combinations

Taxes on land can be an effective, nondistor-
tionary tool for collecting local revenue and
facilitating land redistribution.They can also
encourage productive land usage by taxing
underused land at higher rates.This can be
attractive when large unproductive plots of
land (often held for speculative reasons) cre-
ate artiﬁcially high land prices and limit land
access for poor farmers. But administering a
tax on land requires data on the size, value,
ownership status, productive capacity, and
output of each plot. Because it is hard for the
government to measure the actual degree
of land use, especially for large landholders,
there is a strong incentive for tax evasion.

One way to limit evasion by large land-

holders is to use a mix of land taxes and a
value-added tax (VAT). A VAT can have much
lower rates of evasion and facilitate accu-
rate reporting of cultivation levels. Knowl-
edge of true cultivation levels would then
limit the scope for overreporting the degree
of land use to evade higher tax rates for
underused land. In the absence of insurance
markets, a mix of VAT and land taxes can
also reduce the risk facing smallholders
because tax burdens would be correlated
with output ﬂuctuations.

uting  land  does  little. Beneﬁciaries  must
be provided with a package of assistance
to  ensure  self-sufﬁciency  and  maximize
productivity. The right package will vary
by country but could include training and
credit. Technical  assistance, such  as  help
elaborating farm plans and crop budgets
or  instruction  on  new  technologies, can
be a success factor for subsistence farmers
and those who lack commercial farming
expertise. Credit  can  allow  beneﬁciaries
to make  productivity-enhancing  invest-
ments, for example in irrigation, fencing,
tools, or draft animals.

• Beneﬁciary selection and targeting. When
beneﬁciary selection is politicized, redis-
tributed  land  will  not  always  go  to  the
most  needy  and  capable  farmers. The
solution is to have transparent rules that
allow communities to understand exactly
how and why each beneﬁciary was cho-
sen. Self-targeting—where potential ben-
eﬁciaries seek out land for sale at low cost
and then apply for grants and/or loans—
can also be effective.

• Tenure security. Those who gain access to
redistributed land should be given clear
ownership  rights. In  some  instances, it
may  be  enough  to  have  less  than  full
ownership (such as a certiﬁcate of con-
trol  or  long-term  lease)  to  reduce  un-
certainty, encourage  investment, and
promote the beneﬁts discussed above.

Providing infrastructure
equitably
Infrastructure in most developing countries
is characterized by low and unequal provi-
sion—about  2  people  of every  10  in  the
developing  world  were  without  access  to
safe  water  in  2000, 5  of 10  lived  without
adequate sanitation, and 9 of 10 lived with-
out their wastewater being treated72—with
many  families  suffering  from  inadequate
access especially in rural areas.

Economic  opportunities  are  strongly
shaped  by  access  to  infrastructure. Much
infrastructure  is  traditionally  government
provided  and  so  is  driven  by  the  political
process. Financing constraints and technical
design  challenges  are  very  real  but  perhaps
easier to overcome. When more equal voice

Justice, land, and infrastructure

169

or  the  political  interests  of the  governing
regime make for more broadly accountable
policies, infrastructure  is  provided  in  ways
that are supportive of the economic interests
of poorer  groups—for  example,
in  East
Asia’s intensiﬁcation of irrigation and trans-
port  (see  focus  4  on  Indonesia). In  more
unequal  societies, those  without  inﬂuence
receive less and lower-quality access to pub-
lic services—this often means the poor. This
inequitable  access  also  applies  to  remote
regions  and  excluded  groups, and  some-
times it has a gender dimension. Even worse,
some  infrastructure  services  (utilities  espe-
cially) often become instruments of patron-
age and riddled with problems of inefﬁcient
provision and corrupt practices.

As in the case for land, more equal access
to  infrastructure  would  be  good  for  equity
and  will  often  be  good  for  growth. This
requires addressing difﬁcult ﬁnancing issues,
constraints  that  limit  the  poor’s  ability  to
access infrastructure, and major accountabil-
ity  issues  through  institutional  designs  that
support more equitable response to needs.

More equitable access 
to infrastructure is good 
for growth and equity
There  is  solid  evidence  that  infrastructure
investments broaden opportunities for peo-
ple  and  communities  by  integrating  them
into  regional  and  national  systems  of pro-
duction  and  commerce, and  by  improving
their  access  to  public  services. Location
strongly inﬂuences household market partic-
ipation in Vietnam. And households with the
same  characteristics  and  endowments  yield
different returns in different geographic set-
tings in parts of rural China.73 Leipziger and
others (2003), based on a sample of 73 coun-
tries, ﬁnd that a 10 percent improvement in a
country’s  infrastructure  index  is  associated
with a 5 percent reduction in child mortality,
a  3.5  percent  reduction  in  infant  mortality,
and  a  7.8  percent  reduction  in  maternal
mortality, controlling  for  incomes  and  the
availability of health services. Microevidence
from  rural  India  lends  support  to  these
cross-country  ﬁndings: the  prevalence  and
duration of diarrhea among children under
ﬁve are signiﬁcantly lower for families with
piped water.74

Investments  in  basic  water  and  energy
infrastructure  can  improve  gender  equity.
Around the world, the burden of gathering
and  transporting  fuelwood  and  water  tra-
ditionally  falls  on  women  and  girls. In
Ghana, Tanzania, and  Zambia  women
account  for  two-thirds  of all  household
time  devoted  to  water  and  fuel  collection,
while  children—mostly  girls—account  for
between 5 and 28 percent of time spent on
these  activities. In  rural  Morocco, having
wells or piped water increases the probabil-
ity  that  both  girls  and  boys  will  enroll  in
school, with  larger  impacts  for  girls, who
are responsible for collecting water. Studies
in  Pakistan  show  that  poor  access  to  ﬁre-
wood and water in rural areas means that
women  work  longer  hours  and  have  less
time for income-generating activities, with
impacts  on  the  intrahousehold  balance  of
power. Women and children are also more
subject to health risks from indoor air pol-
lution, given the disproportionate amount
of time  spent  inside  the  home. Electricity
in  the  home  can  reduce  the  need  to  burn
polluting  fuels  for  light  and  cooking. And
improvements in electricity and gas distri-
bution can eliminate time spent collecting
traditional fuels.75

Improving  rural  transport  infrastruc-
ture can reduce transactions costs, expand
access  to  markets, and  improve  rural
incomes. It  is  estimated  that  nearly  two-
thirds  of African  farmers  are  effectively
insulated from national and world markets
because  of poor  market  access.76 In  con-
trast, substantial  investments  in  Indone-
sian roads over the last three decades have
allowed  poor  households  to  successfully
enter the market economy.77 And many of
the roads were built as labor intensive pub-
lic  works, making 
to
unskilled  labor. Similarly, investments  in
rural  infrastructure  (roads, bridges, cul-
verts, and  marketplaces)  in  Bangladesh
have  deepened  the  vibrancy  of the  rural
economy  for  both  agriculture  and  non-
agriculture. Investing  in  rural  roads  is  an
example of how expanding access to infra-
structure can benefit equity and efficiency
in  the  long  run, especially  in  areas  with
large  numbers  of poor  people  and  agro-
climatic potential.78

WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2006

B O X   8 . 9 Lagging infrastructure in Africa

Infrastructure development in Africa is abysmal,
lagging behind the rest of the world in terms of
quantity, quality, cost, and equality of access.
Only 16 percent of roads are paved, the average
waiting time for a telephone connection is three
and half years, transport costs are the highest of
any region, and fewer than one in ﬁve Africans
has access to electricity.What can explain this
tremendous underdevelopment?

• Difﬁcult geography and complex history. Dis-

tance from major markets, the Sahara Desert,
a shortage of natural ports, and vast tracts of
landlocked areas all increase transport costs.
Infrastructure development during colonial
times focused on building transportation
from resource sites to a port. And the
postcolonial division of Africa into many
small states drives up transport and energy
costs, with cumbersome border crossings, lit-
tle regional cooperation on water and power
projects, and incompatible rail systems,
among other factors.

• Financing constraints. Lack of investment has
led to a deterioration in infrastructure, espe-
cially road transport. For instance, in nine East
African countries, maintenance spending
could cover only 20 percent of current
networks. Lack of disposable income means
low demand for infrastructure, and small and

scattered populations make economies of
scale difﬁcult and require higher investments.
Widespread subsidies that go to the relatively
wealthy (the poor generally do not have con-
nections to networked utilities) undermine
governments’ ability to expand access.

• Bad policies and poor accountability. Licens-

ing, competition barriers, and corruption also
impede affordable infrastructure provision.

Despite the difﬁcult geographic and struc-

tural factors, there are opportunities to improve
Africa’s infrastructure. One necessary step is to
boost investment, especially in rehabilitation
and maintenance. Higher public investment will
be needed. Private participation can help
ﬁnance some investments and increase
efﬁciency, but it is unlikely to solve Africa’s infra-
structure problem. A sound institutional and
policy environment is required to attract fresh
investment and use it effectively.

Macroeconomic stability, freedom to repatri-

ate capital, competitive taxes, contract enforce-
ment, low corruption, and adherence to trans-
parent rules are all important to private
investors, especially given the long payback
periods of many infrastructure investments. In
contexts in which policies are sensible but for-
eign private investment is hard to attract,
foreign aid can provide both ﬁnancing for pub-

lic provision and guarantees to help foster pri-
vate participation. Prudent oversight, regulation,
and contract design can also ensure that public
and private ﬁnancing are equitably and
efﬁciently used.

Increasing cross-border and regional coop-

eration is one way to make African
infrastructure more affordable. Streamlined bor-
der crossings and improved road and rail links
would reduce transport costs.Trade in power
and water resources could signiﬁcantly cut costs
as well. For example, it is estimated that South
Africa could save $80 million a year in operating
costs by exchanging electricity with its neigh-
bors (Masters, Sparrow, and Bowen 1999). Seek-
ing innovative ways to broaden access is also
needed. Mozambique has tested a promising
approach: the government set up utility compa-
nies using diesel generators in rural areas and
then sold them to private investors below cost
for continuing commercial operation. Grants
from government, NGOs, or donors for commu-
nity-driven infrastructure projects are another
possibility. Regardless of the approach, commu-
nity and user involvement in infrastructure con-
struction, maintenance, and management is one
of the most effective ways to expand access in
rural areas.

Is privatization the answer?
What  accounts  for  the  failure  of infrastruc-
ture services to serve poor people, especially
in  Africa  (box  8.9)?  Beyond  the  important
role played by historical and geographic con-
texts, there  are  major  ﬁnancing  constraints
and governance challenges. In most develop-
ing  countries, the  public  sector  is  ﬁscally
strapped—public  investment  in  infrastruc-
ture  in  Latin America  dropped  from  3  per-
cent of GDP in 1980 to less than 1 percent in
200179—and public spending requires taxes,
which can exert a drag on efﬁciency and can
mean  forgone  investments  in  other  areas.
Local ﬁnancial markets are generally not suf-
ﬁciently  developed  to  intermediate  private
savings  into  long-term, risky  infrastructure
investments (and, in any case, private savings
are often not large). Foreign private capital is
interested generally in large markets and even
then  only  when  risks  (including  policy  and
exchange  rate  risks)  are  acceptable. State-
owned  infrastructure  companies  in  many
countries—especially when political inequal-

ities  are  large—are  often  inefﬁcient  and
become instruments of patronage.

The 1990s were characterized by a massive
policy  redirection  toward  private  participa-
tion  in  infrastructure—reﬂecting  the  disap-
pointment  with  ineffective  state-operated
utilities, the promise of private funding, and
the greater ﬂexibility offered by technological
change and regulatory innovation.80 But the
privatization  wave  bypassed  many  develop-
ing  countries—Sub-Saharan  Africa  received
only 3 percent of total private infrastructure
investment in developing countries between
1995  and  200081—and  even  where  private
capital  became  the  dominant  source  of
investment (as in Latin America in the mid-
1990s when private investment was 2.5 per-
cent  of GDP), the  results  for  equity  were
mixed. There  were  many  cases  of privatiza-
tion in which access for the poor improved,
especially  when  competition  reduced  politi-
cal capture, but evidence suggests that private
operators also focused on wealthier segments
of the population (box 8.10).

B O X   8 . 1 0 The distributional impact of infrastructure privatization in Latin America: a mixed bag

Private participation in infrastructure increased
dramatically in Latin America during the late
1990s.It went from $21 billion in 1995 to a peak of
$80 billion in 1998, dropping back to $20 billion
by 2002 (World Bank 2004f).The distributional
impact of private investment depends on how
efﬁciency gains are allocated between public and
private interests.In the best cases, privatization
can solve patronage problems and lead to greater
efﬁciency and equity.In worse cases, efﬁciency
gains can be shared between government and
private operators, or go primarily to the private
sector and lead to the consolidation of private
monopoly power (as in Mexican telecommunica-
tions).The outcome depends on the market and
accountability structure, including the effective-
ness of regulation.Evidence from Latin America
shows that privatizations fall into each of these
categories, yielding mixed results for affordable
access by the poor.

Research from Argentina, Bolivia, Mexico,
and Nicaragua shows that utility privatization
increased access and enhanced service quality
for poor consumers in some cases (McKenzie
and Mookherjee 2003). In Chile, access to power
services increased greatly for low-income
groups during the ﬁrst 10 years of private opera-
tion (Estache, Gómez-Lobo, and Leipziger 2001).
In Colombia, private utilities have connected
more of the poorest consumers than their pub-
lic counterparts (World Bank (2001a)). Other
research shows that child mortality caused by
waterborne diseases fell by 5 to 9 percent in the
30 Argentine locales where water services were
privatized, with the strongest beneﬁt—a more
than 25 percent decline in mortality—occurring
in the poorest neighborhoods (Galiani, Gertler,
and Schargrodsky 2002).

Despite the increases in access, there are
two reasons why privatization may have had
adverse effects on the poor through higher
tariffs and connection costs. First, privatization
can reduce the scope for cross-regional subsi-
dies. One study (Campos and others 2003)
showed that the fiscal cost of utilities
increased a few years after privatization. This
was the result of “cream-skimming,” as
observed in Argentina. In some of the
provinces of Argentina, the water concessions
were for the large cities only, leaving the
responsibility for the small cities and rural
areas to the governments. Because the big
cities were cross-subsidizing the other regions
under public provision, privatization reduced
this source of funding and increased the net
fiscal costs once the transaction payoffs from
privatization had disappeared.

Second, connection costs and tariffs were

adjusted to cost-recovery levels following priva-
tization, leading in many instances to higher
prices. In the early 1990s, public utilities in
developing countries subsidized an average of
20 percent of gas and 70 percent of water costs
(World Bank 1994). So when subsidies were cut,
services often became too expensive for poor
consumers. For the water concession in Buenos
Aires, the initial connection charge was set so
high that many users could not afford it
(Estache, Foster, and Wodon 2001), which was
an issue at the center of one of the ﬁrst major
adjustments to the contract (Ugaz and Price
2003).The telecommunications sector in
Argentina also saw price increases following
privatization, largely to rebalance local and long
distance charges. But price increases are not the
norm—competition can drive them down. In

Chile, the liberalization of the telecommunica-
tions market in 1994 reduced call prices by
more than 50 percent. In Argentina, thanks to
the entry of 21 new operators in the generation
sector, residential electricity customers enjoyed
a 40 percent drop in tariffs in the ﬁve years after
privatization (1992–97) (World Bank 2002b).
Ultimately, price changes depend on initial con-
ditions, quality improvements, and regulatory
and institutional frameworks that determine
proﬁts.

Episodes of privatization can be opportuni-
ties to strengthen accountability.They can gen-
erate public discussion about the current state
of service delivery, the options for reform, the
terms of the contract, and the tradeoffs under
consideration. Such occasions can be powerful
in overcoming collective action problems and
mobilizing consumers to express their interests.
But there is also the danger that, in the absence
of the voice of consumers, the process of privati-
zation may be captured by narrow interests with
political connections and better information.
Indeed, that might be one reason why the pub-
lic perception of privatization in Latin America is
so negative.82 There is evidence that privatiza-
tion has been associated with increased power
for conglomerates and their foreign partners—
and with higher proﬁts in noncompetitive sec-
tors. Accusations of corruption during the priva-
tization process, concentrated gains by a few
actors (whether made legally or illegally) con-
trasted with worker layoffs, and unrealistic cus-
tomer expectations regarding service levels
(driven by politicians overselling the promise of
privatization) are also probably to blame for pri-
vatization’s negative public image (De Ferranti
and others 2004).

In the end, experience suggests that pri-
vatization alone is not the answer. Whether
infrastructure services are provided by pri-
vate operators or public utilities seems less
important  for  equity  and  efﬁciency  than
speciﬁc measures to improve access for the
poor, the  structure  of
incentives  facing
providers, and  provider  accountability  to
the general public.

Expanding access and making
services affordable
Whether  expanding  general  access  beneﬁts
the  poor depends  on initial levels of cover-
age. In many African countries, overall access
rates improved over the last decade, but the
bottom  40  percent  of the  population  regis-
tered no gains at all (ﬁgure 8.3). This is not

these  countries,

surprising. Given the low initial coverage in
many  of
the  expansion
favored wealthier households. This does not
mean, however, that expanding access when
overall levels of service provision are low is
bad  for  equity. On  the  contrary—better  to
expand  access  in  this  case  than  to  focus  on
upgrading quality, which would beneﬁt only
the few who already have access.

To expand access to the poor, policymak-
ers  can  set  service  obligations  or  create
incentives for providers. One way is to spec-
ify  universal  service  obligations, which  is
common  in  the  telecommunications  sec-
tor.83 While this is a worthy social objective,
it may not be practical in the short run when
starting  from  low  access  rates. That  is  why
service obligations should include details on

time frames and ways to ﬁnance the obliga-
tion  when  customers  are  unable  to  pay.
Deﬁning connection targets is another way
to promote access. Targets are easy to moni-
tor and can be enforced by ﬁnancial penal-
ties. Of course, connection  targets  can  be
met only if customers are able and willing
to take up the service—and this depends on
their  ability  to  overcome  impediments,
including  title  requirements  and  income
and liquidity constraints (given the lumpi-
ness of connection charges).

In many countries, new connections are
subsidized  to  meet  access  objectives  and
keep  providers  solvent. New  connections
can  be  subsidized  from  charges  to  existing
users, particularly  if the  group  of existing
users  is  much  larger  and  wealthier  than
potential new users. The water and sanita-
tion concessionaire in Buenos Aires adopted
this  type  of cross-subsidy  after  renegotiat-
ing an initial contract that charged onerous
connection  fees  to  the  poor. Government
ﬁnancing for connection subsidies is also an
option, as  is  offering  credit  to  consumers
for connection purchases. In Colombia, the
law  requires  that  connection  charges  for
poor customers be spread over at least three
years.84

A  complement  to  connection  subsidies
are consumption  subsidies, either  through
means-tested transfers ﬁnanced out of gen-
eral tax revenues or through lifeline tariffs.
Subsidized  lifeline  tariffs  require  a  transfer
from those with high levels of consumption
to those with low levels.85 When considering
lifeline subsidies, care must be taken to set a
threshold  that  is  high  enough  to  garner
political  support, yet  low  enough  that  the
poor  are  the  primary  beneﬁciaries. For
instance, evidence from Honduras suggests
that  their  electricity  subsidy  is  too  high—
83.5 percent of residential customers beneﬁt
from  the  subsidy  (those  consuming  under
300 kWh monthly). Means-tested vouchers
for purchasing services are another subsidy
option. They are similar to means-tested tar-
iff subsidies  with  added  ﬂexibility  for  the
user to select a service provider.86

Given  the  liquidity  constraints  of the
poor and the possible seasonality of use and
income, introducing  ﬂexibility  in  payment
is  likely  to  help  expand  access. Increasing
the frequency of billing is one such option.
Prepayment devices, which facilitate budg-
eting 
low-income  households, are
another. On  the  downside, prepayment
could lead to frequent “self-disconnection.”

for 

Utilities  could  also  allow  customers  to
choose from a menu of tariffs with different
combinations of ﬁxed (standing) and vari-
able  charges. Allowing  lower  ﬁxed  charges
in exchange for slightly higher variable ones
could beneﬁt smaller consumers.87

Enabling  consumers  to  make  certain
quality-price 
tradeoffs  by  encouraging
lower-quality  services  is  also  likely  to  be
beneﬁcial. This  can  be  done  by  allowing
lower  standards  of formal  provisioning  in
certain  poor  areas  or  by  encouraging  a
vibrant network of informal providers that
can either operate independently or through
subcontracting arrangements with the for-
mal provider.

Water  service  provides  an  example. A
study  using  data  from  47  countries  shows
that  informal  providers  such  as  point-
source vendors (kiosks) and mobile distrib-
utors  (such  as  tanker  trucks  and  carters)
systematically charge more than networked
providers, both public and private.88 Micro-
economic evidence supports this. In Niger,
for example, wealthier households are more
likely  to  use  networked  rather  than  infor-
mal  providers  and  pay  less  per  unit  con-
sumed (ﬁgure 8.4). But informal providers
can  offer  a  valuable  service, because  many
poor  users  cannot  afford  connection
charges or monthly lump-sum bills or live
in areas inaccessible to utilities for legal or
technical  reasons. Recognizing  that  private
connections for all households may not be a
feasible goal in the near term, governments
and  utilities  can  work  with 
informal
providers. For instance, kiosk services could
be  improved  by  subsidizing  kiosk  connec-
tions, increasing competition among kiosks,
and introducing performance measures and
quality  standards.89 In  Senegal, one  study
argues  for  directing  subsidies  away  from
private connections toward water provided
at 
informal
providers (box 8.11).

standposts  or  by  other 

High tariffs for the consumer reﬂect the
pricing decisions of the utilities concerned
and the taxation decisions of local and cen-
tral  governments. Avoiding  exclusivity  in
contracts  and  liberalizing  entry, including
through  the  participation  of independent
private  providers  or  communities  in  non-
network  services, can  help  reduce  costs.

B O X   8 . 1 1 The pro-poor agenda for urban water in Senegal

In 1995, the government of Senegal
launched sweeping reforms in the urban
water sector.The bankrupt public sector
utility was dissolved. A new state asset-
holding company was created to manage
the sector. And a private operator was con-
tracted to run the system based on an inter-
national competitive bidding process.The
reform had positive outcomes for the poor,
thanks to strong government commitment,
connection subsidies in low-income neigh-
borhoods, and well-designed operator
incentives. But tariff inequities and poor tar-
geting of subsidies remain.

Subsidies targeted at the poor take three

forms:consumption subsidies,connection
subsidies,and construction of standposts in
areas lacking private connections.In Senegal,
consumption subsidies are delivered through
an increasing block tariff with a low “social tar-
iff”for household consumption under 10 m3
per month.The problem with consumption
subsidies is that many poor families do not

have a connection at all or share a connection
with several other families,which bumps
them into a higher consumption block.

Connection subsidies have beneﬁted

the poor, but those who could beneﬁt most
are likely to be ineligible because they lack
title to their land and an established house.
The construction of public standposts has
expanded access but does not necessarily
provide the lowest-cost water.Tariffs on
water sold to licensed standpost vendors
are considerably higher than the subsidized
social tariff and vendors also charge an
overhead fee. Analysis of one NGO-run
standpost showed that users were paying
350 percent more than the social tariff rate.
Given these shortcomings, it would make
more sense to direct consumption subsidies
away from private connections and into
water provided at standposts or by other
informal providers who serve the poorest.

Source: Brocklehurst and Janssens (2004).

Moreover, many governments view utilities
and  telecommunications  as  cash  cows,
imposing  indirect  consumption  taxes  that
tend to be regressive where connectivity to
the  formal  system  is  high. In  Argentina,
utilities generate about 1 percent of tax rev-
enue; in addition to the income tax, there is

174

WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2006

a 21 percent VAT plus municipal and provin-
cial taxes. So indirect taxes can be as high as
55 percent in some municipalities. Reducing
such taxes would reduce tariffs.90

Naturally, beneﬁts can be lower and costs
higher  for  investments  in  poor, remote
areas that are short on economic potential.
This analysis is not blind to those consider-
ations, but also it recognizes the argument
that  there  can  be  long-run  beneﬁts  from
greater inclusion of groups that are margin-
alized  because  of location  or  poverty  (see
focus 6 on regional inequality).

Strengthening governance, voice,
and accountability
Infrastructure provision suffers from severe
problems of corruption and lack of account-
ability. Because  infrastructure  investments
are  typically  large  and  lumpy, and  often
exhibit  increasing  returns  to  scale  or  net-
work externalities, they are less amenable to
competition in ﬁnancing and provision and
generate  signiﬁcant  scope  for  corruption
and patronage. Politicians bribe public util-
ity  ofﬁcials  and  pursue  political  goals  by
transferring resources to politically inﬂuen-
tial  groups, rather  than  encouraging  utili-
ties to expand service and cut costs.

One possible solution is to subject utili-
ties  to  performance  pressures  and  reduce
politicians’ willingness or ability to use them
for political purposes.91 The prudent use of

Council (with civil society representatives)
assesses the agency’s annual reports and
publishes the ﬁndings in the ofﬁcial gazette

uates the agency’s performance every two

telecommunications regulator to receive ISO-
9001 certiﬁcation, an international standard
for meeting customers’technical needs.

Peru has made similar progress in

improving regulation by increasing

tracts and quality standards.The agency sets

tory proposals must be supported by assess-

addition, the agency has multiple dispute res-
olution mechanisms.Independent commit-
tees, supported by experts, resolve disputes

isfactorily managed by phone companies.

regulation  is  another  way  to  strengthen
accountability  and  reduce  political  capture
and  corruption. Regulators  have  a  key  role
in ensuring that the public interest is being
served. This includes safeguarding the value
of public  assets, upholding  the  sectoral
norms relating to health and safety, provid-
ing  information  about  the  performance  of
the service provider, and enforcing compli-
ance with contractual obligations.

If effective, regulation  will  have  an
important impact on efﬁciency and equity.
Evidence comes from a study of the energy,
telecommunications, and  water  sectors  in
Argentina  that  separated  the  beneﬁts  of
privatization  from  those  of effective  reg-
ulation. The  study  found  that  effective
regulation  yielded  operational  gains  more
than  one-third  higher  than  the  gains  from
privatization  alone  and  equivalent  to  0.35
percent of GDP, or 16 percent of the average
expenditure  on  utility  services. Gains  for
the  lowest  quintiles  were  proportionately
higher. Another study of 1,000 concessions
in Latin America found that even a moder-
ately well-functioning regulator can temper
opportunistic renegotiation of contracts. It
concluded that the probability of renegotia-
tion  goes  from  17  percent  in  a  setting  in
which a regulatory body exists to 60 percent
in settings it does not.92

Positive impacts of regulation are condi-
tioned  on  the  ability  to  insulate  regulators
somewhat  from  pressures  coming  from
politicians  and  providers. Measures  to
strengthen the independence of the regula-
tor are paramount, and this may require a
separate  agency  with  reliable  and  ring-
fenced  funding  and  stafﬁng. When  assets
are decentralized, the regulatory agency can
be at the level of the central or regional gov-
ernment. In  short, regulators  should  be
subject 
to  substantive  and  procedural
requirements  that  ensure  integrity, inde-
pendence, transparency, and accountability
(box 8.12).

In  situations  in  which  local  provision  is
more  susceptible  to  capture  by  local  elites,
the  central  government  can  inﬂuence  local
outcomes by using ﬁscal incentives to nudge
local  governments  toward  broader  access
and by reducing costs for the poor through
contingent intergovernmental transfers. This

requires  setting  performance  targets, elicit-
ing  competition  among  local  governments,
and benchmarking to monitor performance.
It also requires sufﬁcient policy autonomy at
the local level to meet the speciﬁed targets.

Monitoring the performance of providers
requires  reliable  information  and  perform-
ance  benchmarks. This  is  more  easily  done
when  there  is  a  management  contract  or  a
concession agreement with clear service obli-
gations or when there are performance con-
tracts with similar features for public utilities.
Community  involvement  can  help  monitor
compliance. A national regulator can bench-
mark  local  government  performance  when
infrastructure assets and policy decisions are
decentralized and provide useful information
for intergovernmental ﬁscal transfers.

Summary
Justice  systems  can  do  much  to  level  the
playing ﬁeld in the political, economic, and
sociocultural  domains, especially  when
societies  press  for  equitable  laws  and  for
transparency  and  accountability  in  their
implementation. Legal 
institutions  can
uphold  the  political  rights  of citizens  and
curb  the  capture  of the  state  by  the  elite.
They  can  equalize  economic  opportunities
by  protecting  property  rights  for  all  and
ensuring nondiscrimination in the market.
They can force change in the social domain
by  challenging  inequitable  practices. But

legal 

justice  systems  and 
institutions,
embedded  as  they  are  in  the  political  and
socioeconomic structure of societies, can be
hijacked by special interests.

Broadening  access  to  land  can  enhance
people’s opportunities to engage in produc-
tive activities. The distribution of land rights,
especially  ownership  rights,
is  skewed  in
many countries, and challenging this pattern
is difﬁcult. Past land reform efforts show the
need for a broader menu of policies that go
beyond  redistribution  through  expropria-
tion  and  include  improvements  to  tenure
security and the functioning of rental mar-
kets. There  is  also  scope  for  redistribution
through channels other than expropriation.
More  equitable  access  to  infrastructure
also  has  equity  and  efﬁciency  beneﬁts.
Broadening  access  to  infrastructure  brings
people closer to markets and services and to
the power and water they need for produc-
tive activities and daily existence, expanding
their  economic  opportunities. Expanding
affordable access for poor people and poor
areas  requires  tackling  difﬁcult  ﬁnancing
issues, designing subsidies effectively, work-
ing  with  informal  providers, as  well  as
making  providers  more  accountable  and
strengthening the voice of beneﬁciaries. The
challenges  of expanding  access  to  justice,
land, and  infrastructure  and  rooting  out
corruption and elite capture remain signiﬁ-
cant for many developing countries.

taxation 

Raising revenues for equitable
policies
The publicly-provided, equity-enhancing pro-
grams  outlined  in  this  report, from  early
childhood development interventions to water
supply, have to be ﬁnanced. The resources to
fund  them  must  generally  be  raised  through
taxation. In  fact, a  key  ingredient  for  a  well-
functioning public sector is a societal under-
standing  that  the  quality  of public  services
depends on everyone paying their share of the
tax  burden. Where  this  perception  fails, the
social  compact  breaks  down, and  tax  avoid-
ance  and  evasion  become  widespread. This
leads to a vicious circle of free-riding and tax
rate increases, with adverse consequences for
the public ﬁnances, the quality of service deliv-
ery, and social cohesion.

It  follows  that  the  same  institutions
that  influence  the  quality  and  breadth  of
service  delivery  also  affect  the  overall  tax
effort. Revenues,
like  spending, increase
with  a  country’s  level  of income, but  the
quality of institutions—notably voice and
accountability—also  matters, even  when
controlling  for  income1 (see  ﬁgure  S5.1).
Voice and accountability can strengthen the
tax effort, as the services provided become a
reﬂection of the desires of the broader elec-
torate rather than of a privileged few. Lin-
dert  (2004)  argues  that  the  expansion  of
voice in twentieth-century Europe was the
driving  force  behind  fashioning  the  social
compact  that  delivered  high  and  equitable
growth  alongside  extensive  public  provi-

sion  of services  during  1950–80. In  Chile
and  the  Republic  of Korea, too, the  emer-
gence  of representative  institutions  (and
higher  incomes  and  administrative  capac-
ity) led to higher taxation and spending.

For  similar  reasons, high  inequality  in
the  distribution  of political  power  and
wealth may be prejudicial to the tax effort.
The  low  tax  revenues  in  most  of Central
America  may  reﬂect  the  low  solidarity  of
the  elite  with  middle-  and  lower-income
groups: the small, wealthiest segment of the
population is unwilling to pay more in taxes
to provide public services, because the elite
can  procure  many  private  substitutes  for
publicly-provided  services, ranging  from
public safety to education and roads.2

Resource rents can relieve the ﬁscal con-
straint  on  spending  and  in  principle  pro-
vide  resources  for  equitable  provision,
though  they  raise  a  host  of governance
challenges. The  ability  of
resource-rich
states  to  rely  on  “unearned” revenues  can
undermine the accountability embedded in
the  social  compact  underpinning  sound
public  ﬁnance.3 If not  properly  addressed,
the result may be wasted natural resources,
corrupt  state 
institutions, and  poorer
prospects  for  long-run  growth  and  equity.
A  few  recent  efforts  to  harness  resource
rents  for  broad-based  development 
in
countries  with  poor  institutions  aim  to
introduce 
transparency 
and
accountability (see box on next page).

compact, in much the same way as resource
revenues, by  making  governments 
less
beholden to civic interests.4 Some evidence
suggests that higher levels of aid are associ-
ated  with  lower  revenue  collection, espe-
cially  among  poorly  governed  countries.5
Donors  should  thus  consider  ways  of sup-
porting accountable institutions in recipient
countries—both for spending and taxation
(see chapter 10 for discussion of aid).

While  institutional  transparency  and
accountability  and  linking  good  public
services  to  the  taxes  that  fund  them  are
probably  the  ﬁrst-order  determinants  of
successful revenue-raising, technical aspects
of public  ﬁnance  are  important  to  reduce
efﬁciency  costs. Lindert  (2004)  argues  that
among  industrial  countries, high  social
beneﬁt/high  tax  societies—most  notably
Scandinavia—have  paid  particular  atten-
tion to tax design to reduce adverse incen-
tive  effects  for  labor  effort  and  capital
investment to sustain growth. Tax design is
an  immense  area. From  the  perspective  of
equity, the  primary  contribution  of taxa-
tion  is  in  providing  the  resources  to  fund
equity-enhancing  spending. For  this, the
principal criteria are minimizing efﬁciency
costs, administrative  feasibility, and  politi-
cal  supportability. For  speciﬁc  tax  instru-
ments,
there  can  also  be  potential  for
positive direct effects on equity. Here we sug-
gest seven basic principles for mobilizing tax
revenues  in  ways  that  minimize  efﬁciency
costs, while not undermining equity.6

1. Tax bases should be as broad as possible.
A  broad-based  consumption  tax, for
example, will still discourage labor sup-
ply on the margin, but choices between
tradable  and  nontradable  goods  and
services  will  not  be  distorted, if all  are
taxed at the same rate. A few items (such
as gasoline, tobacco products, and alco-
hol) may be chosen for higher tax rates,
because  of
their  negative  spillover
effects or because the demand for these
products  is  relatively  unresponsive  to
taxation. As  a  result, at  any  given  tax
rate, efﬁciency  costs  will  be  relatively
low  and 
relatively  high.
Income tax bases should also be broad,
treating all incomes, from every source,
as uniformly as possible.

revenues 

2. Tax rates should be as low as possible (as
long  as  they  raise  sufﬁcient  revenue  to
ﬁnance the appropriate expenditures of
government). Of course, the broader the

estates, and  inheritances  are  consistent
with  this  report’s  notion  that  predeter-
mined  circumstances  should  not  affect  a
person’s life chances.8 The efﬁciency argu-
ments and the evidence are mixed: parents
may work more or less to avoid inheritance
taxes, and  so  may  save  more  or  less.
Although  inheritance  taxes  may  be  difﬁ-
cult  to  collect  and  are  likely  to  represent
only a modest reduction in wealth concen-
tration, they  may  help  prevent  “extreme
concentrations  of wealth  from  being
passed from generation to generation.”9 In
addition, a design that restricts transfers of
control rights on corporations can be good
for both equity and efﬁciency.10

7. Avoid  implicit  taxes. In  many  instances,
the  most  important  taxes  affecting  the
poor are not formal ones levied through
the tax code, but implicit taxes, including
bribes11 and inﬂation. Other implicit taxes
to be avoided include many instances  of
“regulation  as  taxation” such  as  quasi-
taxes 
imposed  through  controls  on
trade, prices, credit, foreign exchange, or
capital markets.12

base, the lower the rate needed to gener-
ate  a  given  revenue  level. Lower  rates
lower  the  efﬁciency  costs. The  general
rule is that the distorting effect of taxes
increases proportionally to the square of
the  tax  rate, so  halving  the  tax  rate
implies a fourfold increase in efﬁciency.
From an efﬁciency perspective, it is bet-
ter  to  impose  a  single  rate  on  a  broad
base  of taxpayers, rather  than  dividing
that  base  into  segments  and  imposing
different  rates  on  each  one. This  needs
to be balanced against the distributional
argument for graduated rate schedules.
3. Keep  indirect  taxes  from  being  regressive.
With  a  few  key  exemptions, value-added
taxes  (VAT)  can  be  made  less  regressive.
Bird  and  Miller  (1989)  show  in  Jamaica
that exempting just ﬁve speciﬁc items from
VAT halves the burden on the poorest 40
percent  of
the  population. Reducing
regressive  excise  taxes  (as  well  as  import
duties), on food or kerosene is also desir-
able. To make up for lost revenue from any
of these measures, there are often good rea-
sons for higher taxes on private transport.
Export  taxes  are  generally  best  avoided,
both on efﬁciency and on equity grounds.
4. Raise  personal  income  tax  collections.
Collection from personal income taxes is

low  in  developing  countries. But  in  the
light  of the  second  point, higher  rev-
enues  should  be  sought  ﬁrst  by  closing
loopholes and enforcing greater compli-
ance, and only later through higher mar-
ginal rates. Income taxes need to apply to
persons and to corporations. To keep tax
avoidance in check, the top marginal rate
of the  personal  income  tax  should  be
fairly  close  to  the  rate  of the  corporate
income tax, which means that the rate is
not likely to be all that high.

5. Use  property  taxes  more. Property  taxes
account for only a small share of taxes in
developing  countries. Their  coverage  is
typically not comprehensive, and assess-
ments  and  collection  rates  are  low.
Although  nominal  rates  are  also  low,
governments  usually  ﬁnd  rate  increases
in  this  very  visible  tax  difﬁcult  to  sell
politically. Simply  raising  the  tax  rate
usually would burden only the few actu-
ally  paying  taxes. Higher  nominal  rates
are likely to be acceptable only with bet-
ter  tax  administration, such  as  more
comprehensive  coverage, better  and
more  frequently  evaluated  assessments,
and enforced penalties for late payment.7
6. Consider  inheritance  taxes. Because  heirs
have  not  earned  the  wealth, taxing  gifts,

Managing resource rents transparently and equitably

High overall standards of transparency and
accountability are essential if the revenues
from extractive industries are to be used well.
However, as a second best solution in weak
institutions of accountability, many countries,
developed and developing, do not pool the
revenues from extractive industries with other
resources in a uniﬁed planning and budget
process. Instead, they are channeled to a dedi-
cated fund, with special arrangements to
earmark the revenues for speciﬁc purposes;
deﬁne reporting and disclosure requirements;
and establish oversight bodies to ensure that
the arrangements are properly implemented.

One common objective of such revenue
management arrangements is to save part of
the revenue stream.The savings may be used for
short-term budgetary stabilization, so that
expenditures are protected from ﬂuctuations in
prices and output.They may also be used to
build up ﬁnancial assets, which can generate
revenues over an extended period, in some
cases constituting a perpetual fund, so that
future generations can beneﬁt from the
revenues generated from the depletion of
resources. Azerbaijan, Chad, and Kazakhstan

have legislated savings to deﬂect pressures to
spend revenues quickly and unproductively.

Revenue management arrangements can also
serve distributional objectives.In Chad,the Oil Rev-
enue Management Law assigns a share of revenues
to a “future generation fund”and speciﬁes alloca-
tions for poverty reduction.Such earmarked alloca-
tions may be anathema to ﬁnancial managers,but
they communicate and underline the government’s
commitment to prudent and redistributive spend-
ing.Nigeria’s experience in the Niger Delta during
the 1980s and 1990s highlights the resentment and
political instability that can result when local com-
munities see no demonstrable beneﬁts from the
extractive industries in their midst.The democratic
government has responded by creating a Niger
Delta Development Commission to fund local
development,with statutory contributions from the
federal government and the oil companies.

High standards of transparency and account-
ability are essential if the revenues from extractive
industries are to be used for development
purposes.To reduce the risk of diversion of
revenues, the Extractive Industries Transparency
Initiative (EITI), championed by the United King-
dom, calls on governments and extractive indus-

tries to report and reconcile payments and rev-
enues.Some companies have taken the initiative
of publishing payments to government in some
of the countries in which they operate—for exam-
ple, Shell in Nigeria and British Petroleum in Azer-
baijan.The “Publish What You Pay”coalition advo-
cates more systematic disclosure of companies’
annual reports and for home-country legislation
to make such declarations mandatory.Equally
important are improvements in government
reporting arrangements to ensure transparency
in the application of revenues generated by large
projects, such as the Chad-Cameroon pipeline
and the Nam Theun 2 hydropower project in the
Lao People’s Democratic Republic.

Revenue management arrangements are
likely to be more successful when they are the
product of a broad consultative process and the
rationale is widely understood.Timor-Leste has
facilitated broad civil society involvement in the
design of the revenue management arrangements
for its offshore oil and gas industry.Draft legisla-
tion on the industry’s commercial and tax regime
and legislation on a proposed petroleum fund,
have been published and subjected to numerous
public consultations.

Markets and the
macroeconomy

Achieving  more  equal  access  to  markets  is
fundamental  to  greater  equity  within  soci-
eties  as  well  as  to  moving  countries  onto
dynamic  growth  paths,
thus  enhancing
global equity. And both equity and growth
are  best  served  by  prudent  macropolicy
(allowing for its countercyclical role). This
chapter is organized around the three mar-
kets for capital, labor, and goods (land was
covered in chapter 8) and the macroecon-
omy, exploring in each domain the poten-
tial and options for leveling the economic
playing  field  and  strengthening  voice  and
accountability.

How markets relate to equity
Issues  of design  of market-related  reforms
and  macroeconomic  policy  are  often  allo-
cated  to  ministries  of ﬁnance, macro-  and
trade  economists, ﬁnancial  specialists, and
the  like. By  contrast, policies  for  equity,
including  those  for  managing  the  conse-
quences  of market  conditions  and  macro-
conditions, are  typically  considered  the
domain  of the  providers  of schools, health
centers, rural  roads, safety  nets, and  justice
systems. This division of labor is profoundly
incorrect. The ﬁrst set of policy domains is
as important for equity as the second.

The main issue is access. The playing ﬁeld
is typically far from level in the workings of
markets. Barriers are intrinsically inequitable
when they privilege insiders’ access to capital,
good jobs, and favored product markets. But
they  are  also  bad  for  the  innovation  and
investment  that  lie  at  the  heart  of modern
economic  growth. That  is  why  leveling  the
playing  ﬁeld  has  the  potential  to  be  both
more equitable and more efﬁcient. It is also
why  broadening  access  typically  requires
more economic competition and more polit-
ical accountability.

There  are  two  broad  categories  of
pathology  that  make  the  playing  field
uneven (see table 9.1). The first pathology
arises  when  the  influence  of powerful
political  and  economic  elites  is  bad  for
equity  and  typically  bad  for  growth—
whether  this  takes  the  form  of outright
predation  by  political  elites  or  excessive
influence of economic elites in the shaping
of policies and institutions, as under “oli-
garchic capitalism.” As we read in chapter
6, Mexico’s financial system through much
of the country’s history provides an exam-
ple of elite capture—a protected, relational,
incumbent-oriented financial system.

The second pathology arises when policy
efforts  to  control  or  manage  markets  are
directed, at  least  notionally, to  improve
equity, but  with  high  costs  for  efﬁciency,
and  are  often  captured  by  middle  groups
(or  indeed  elites)  in  ways  that  harm  the
poor. This had its extreme manifestation in
communist  economic  policy, but  it  is  also
prevalent in societies in which markets play
a large role. Another example is when pro-
tection  for  formal  sector  workers, while
bringing  valued  beneﬁts  to  some, slows
processes of restructuring and job creation
for  other  workers. Both  pathologies, but
especially  the  ﬁrst, reﬂect  Adam  Smith’s
concern that the inﬂuential may shape mar-
kets to serve the interests of incumbents. As
he  said, “People  of the  same  trade  seldom
meet  together, even  for  merriment  and
diversion, but  the  conversation  ends  in  a
conspiracy  against  the  public, or  in  some
contrivance to raise prices.”1

The main purpose of this chapter is not
to  diagnose  from  where  such  pathologies
came but to explore possibilities for change
that are feasible within the prevailing politi-
cal, sociocultural, and  economic  context.
Casual  observation  suggests  that  change  is

been reformed after the 1995 Tequila Crisis.
Moroccan  industry  was  (partially)  dispro-
tected. And many countries no longer pur-
sue  populist  macropolicy, especially  after
they experienced its ill effects.

Reducing  barriers  to  market  access  will
often  bring  initial  beneﬁts, or  redistribu-
tions, not  to  the  poorest  but  to  middle
groups. There may even be temporary rises
in inequalities in parts of the income distri-
bution, for example when there are increases
in returns to skills. This is desirable for efﬁ-
ciency and consistent with equity if institu-
tions  allow  households  and  individuals  to
respond to the new incentives, and there are
safety nets to manage those who are hurt. It
is  undesirable, however, if it  creates  new
possibilities  for  middle  groups  to  “hoard
opportunities” at the cost of future growth
and gains for the poor.2

Design choices will depend on the mar-
ket and local context, including the political
context, but  two  cross-cutting  issues  are
worth  highlighting. First, there  is  often  an
apparent paradox: when systems are shaped
to  favor  those  with  inﬂuence  and  connec-
tion, economic  liberalization  should  be
good for equity; however, that is not always
the case. Liberalization can also be captured
by  the  powerful, perpetuating  inequitable
and  inefﬁcient  economic  structures—and
risking political and social backlash to mar-
ket-oriented reforms. This is why liberaliza-
tion  needs  to  be  designed  in  ways  that
promote genuine competition and effective
accountability  structures, whether  in  the
form  of regulation, transparency, or  other
forms  of societal  control, and  sequenced
properly.

Second, while greater equity can be com-
plementary to long-run prosperity, the sec-
ond  pathology  vividly  shows  the  potential
for inefﬁcient choices in the name of equity.
Tradeoffs  between  equity  and  efﬁciency
exist. And  even  when  there  are  aggregate
gains, protected  incumbents  will  be  losers,
at  least  in  the  short  to  medium  term  (in
economists’ jargon, changes  will  often  not
be  Pareto-improving). Whether  societies
choose to compensate losers is a matter of
social  welfare  (especially  if they  are  poor)
and political economy (especially if they are
not poor).

We  now  turn  to  the  three  markets  for
capital, labor, and  goods  and  the  macro-
economy, exploring  in  each  domain  the
potential and options for broadening access
and  strengthening  accountability. Box  9.1
illustrates  some  of the  interactions  among
equity, inequality, and growth in China.

Achieving equity and efﬁciency
in ﬁnancial markets
The performance of enterprises drives eco-
nomic growth. An innovative and dynamic
enterprise  sector  requires  low  barriers  to
entry, effective  guarantees  for  property
rights, and access to finance. We focus on
the latter here. Unequal access to finance is
associated with reduced productive oppor-
tunities  and  reflects  unequal  influence.
Financial  market  liberalization  can  in-
crease  access, but  it  can  also  be  captured.
Sound  technical  design  and  strengthened
accountability  can  help  expand  access
while  reducing  both  the  risk  of capture
and disincentives to broader lending, thus
enhancing opportunities.

WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2006

B O X   9 . 1 Markets and development: 

policy, equity, and social welfare in China

China looms large in any attempt to inter-
pret development, especially the role of
equity in development processes. Hasn’t it
moved from a highly equitable form of
communism to extensive use of domestic
and international markets? And didn’t this
lead to both rising income inequality and
the most extraordinary pace and scale of
reduction in poverty and expansion in
social welfare in history? This looks, at ﬁrst
glance, like a brute fact refutation of a cen-
tral message of this report: that equity can
lay the basis for prosperous development.
An account along these lines misreads

change in China in important ways: many of
the changes were equity-enhancing in the
sense of leading to expansion of opportuni-
ties of the bulk of the population (chapter 6
discussed the institutional underpinnings of
these changes). Consider some of the major
shifts in Chinese policy that the literature
interprets as having driven growth and
income poverty: the institutional shift to the
household responsibility system allowing
peasants to produce for themselves (1979
and early 1980s), the expansion of township
and village enterprises (TVEs) and the mas-
sive indirect effects of opening to interna-
tional trade (whole period), the opening to
inward foreign direct investment (especially
in the 1990s), and the huge internal migra-
tion ﬂows. All these led to major expansions
in opportunity (and were major sources of
growth) for large segments of the popula-
tion. Rural reform quickly expanded oppor-
tunities for most peasants.TVEs were
broadly dispersed.While the effects of inter-
national opening were concentrated
initially in coastal areas, they have
broadened in scope, both through the indi-
rect effects of migration and the relocation
of industries inland.

By contrast, where investment has been

linked to connections and corruption, it is
clearly inequitable, in the sense of lacking
fair process and equality of opportunity to
all potential investors. In the long term, intro-
ducing fairer and more transparent process
will be important to sustained growth.
There were periods in which policy-

related shifts (such as selective opening, the
pricing of foodgrains, tighter controls on
internal migration, and access to urban jobs)
were associated with biases either against
inner provinces of China or against rural
areas.These were factors behind the rise in
inequality in outcomes and stagnating
income poverty between the late 1980s and
early 1990s.This was probably inequitable in
terms of rising inequality of opportunity. For
these cases there may have been some
tradeoff, but few observers argue that such
policy-induced biases were essential to Chi-
nese growth, in contrast to the overall insti-
tutional change and opening.

Moreover, even using the much

narrower lens of income inequality, the peri-
ods when inequality fell (notably the early
1980s and the mid-1990s) actually had the
highest growth rates, not the lowest. And
the provinces where rural inequality rose
the least had the highest growth rates.

There are rising concerns in China over
the adverse consequences for development
of growing inequality,including in some areas
of social provisioning (in health,for example),
and concentrations of wealth through con-
nections.But there is no evidence that these
brought beneﬁts in income growth,the issue
of concern here,and most observers (and the
Chinese government) would see this as an
area in which policy could be improved.

Unequal access to ﬁnance 
is associated with unequal
productive opportunities 
and reﬂects unequal inﬂuence
As  discussed  in  chapter  5, the  access  to
ﬁnancial  services  and  their  cost  are  un-
equally distributed, especially in developing
countries. Many  ﬁrms  and  households
complain  that  the  right  ﬁnancial  services
are not provided, that procedures for open-
ing  an  account  or  getting  a  loan  are  too
cumbersome  and  costly  (with  high  rejec-

tion  rates), and  that  ﬁnancial  institutions
demand collateral, which (poorer) borrow-
ers typically lack.

Financial  institutions  respond  that  they
cannot provide services proﬁtably for tech-
nical and economic reasons. Poorer groups
have small savings, and seek small loans and
insurance  (life, health, crop), which  are
hard to provide. Smaller clients borrow fre-
quently  and  repay  in  small  installments,
making serving their needs very costly. And
the  underserved  are  new  and  not  experi-
enced in business, making them poor credit
risks. But such reasons form only part of the
story. The microcredit movement and large
banks, such as Bank Rakyat Indonesia and
ICICI Bank in India, show that it is possible
to  provide  ﬁnancial  services  proﬁtably  to
poorer customers and small ﬁrms. Access is
also  unequal  in  areas  of ﬁnance  in  which
enforcement is not as much of a concern—
such as deposit-taking.

Inequalities  in  access  are  also, in  part, a
product  of unequal  inﬂuence. Incumbents
who  beneﬁt  from  restricted  patterns  of
ﬁnance may lobby to limit access to ﬁnance,
or erect other barriers to protect the rents of
established ﬁrms. Barriers to entrepreneurial
activity are indeed generally more onerous in
poorer, more  corrupt, and  more  unequal
countries.3 Weak property rights are part of
the problem. But weak property rights can be
the  outcome  of political  economy  forces—
economic elites have an interest in the selec-
tive  protection  of property  rights, because
they  stand  to  gain  more  when  security  of
contracts  and  property  depends  on  their
position, connections, and wealth.4

We  are  primarily  concerned  here  with
the  ﬁrst  pathology  mentioned  earlier,
namely the inﬂuence of economic elites on
the  shaping  of ﬁnancial  systems. In  many
countries, a small number of wealthy fami-
lies  or  groups  exert  extensive  control  over
the corporate sector, notably through con-
trol pyramids in which cross-shareholdings
lead to dominant control rights in extensive
parts of the corporate sector, often substan-
tially in excess of the share of capital owned.
These  wealthy  families  are  typically  linked
to  political  elites  through  economic  deals,
family  connections, and  shared  social  and

Public ﬁnancial institutions in Brazil appear to have served larger ﬁrms more than private banks have (Kumar 2005).
Following liberalization in the late 1970s, many privatizations of state-owned banks went to groups of insiders (Larrain 1989).
Mass privatization in the Czech Republic delayed the establishment of a securities and exchange commission, facilitating tunneling
(stealing assets by channeling to another ﬁrm owned by insiders) (Cull, Matesova, and Shirley 2002).
Market attributes large ﬁnancial value for political connections, suggesting politics rather than economics determined access or
rents (Fisman 2001b).
Banks, protected and dependent on government support, lend to less productive ﬁrms (Bertrand, Schoar, and Thesmar 2004).
The opening up of new segments of ﬁnancial services provision was dominated by insiders. Increasing openness primarily expanded
and strengthened the politically most connected ﬁrms (Haggard, Lim, and Kim 2003, Siegel 2003).
The imposition of capital controls in September 1998 primarily beneﬁted ﬁrms with ties to Prime Minister Mahathir (Johnson and
Mitton 2003).
There was capture of the ﬁnancial sector in Mexico in the late 1800s blocking entry in emerging industries (Haber, Noel, and Razo
2003).
Lending to connected interests in the early 1990s was prevalent (20 percent of commercial loans) and took place on better terms
than arms’ length lending (annual interest rates were 4 percentage points lower). Related loans were 33 percent more likely to
default and had lower recovery rates (30 percent less) than unrelated ones (La Porta, López-de-Silanes, and Zamarripa 2002).
Insider activities have signiﬁcant economic costs. Politically connected ﬁrms borrowed twice as much from government banks and
had 50 percent higher default rates between 1996 and 2002, with economywide costs of rent-seeking estimated to be 0.3 percent to
1.9 percent of GDP per year. Brokers trading on their own behalf earned annual rates of return 50–90 percentage points higher than
those earned by outside investors. Hence, price manipulation by intermediaries helps keep equity markets marginal with few
outsiders investing and little capital raised (Khwaja and Mian 2004, 2004b). 
Russia’s free-for-all banking entry, combined with its choice of a universal banking system, gave great discretion to insiders to
conduct asset stripping through the loan-for-shares scheme. The weak political accountability could not stop the capture of state
resources or protected rents (Perotti 2002, Black, Kraakman, and Tassarova 2000).
Connected lending was large before the 1997 crisis and ﬁrms with connections to banks and politicians had greater access to long-
term debt (Wiwattanakantang, Kali, and Charumilind forthcoming).
New bank licenses went largely to insiders in New York state (Haber 2004).
Firms that have an owner of Asian or European descent have a 0.34 higher probability of obtaining credit from suppliers 
(Fisman 2003).

cultural capital. Examples include the Mex-
ican  banking  system, until  the  reforms  of
the second half of the 1990s, and the con-
centrated  wealth  and  close  connections
between  economic  and  political  elites  in
East Asia (ﬁgure 2.8).5

Concentrated  corporate  control  and
wealth  should  be  a  concern  if it  leads  to
biases in access toward the inﬂuential and,
even  more, if it  is  associated  with  reduced
innovation  and  dynamism. Reduced  inno-
vation can occur through direct restrictions
on  opportunity  and  the  indirect  effects  of
weaker property rights. Cross-country evi-
dence  suggests  that  there  is  a  relationship.
Countries with more self-made billionaires
tend  to  grow  faster, whereas  those  with
more  hereditary  billionaires  grow  more
slowly, suggesting  costs  of dynastic  family
control  over  economies. Societies  with
greater  family  control  over  the  corporate
sector also grow more slowly.6

More  compelling  evidence  on  the  links
between unequal power and ﬁnancial sector
distortions comes from case study material,
from  the  historical  experience  of now-
developed societies, and from contemporary
developing  countries.7 Table  9.2  provides  a
selective list of results from recent studies of
developing  and  transition  countries. These
case  studies  illustrate  that  unequal  wealth
and inﬂuence and low political accountabil-
ity  can  be  bad  for  entry  and  bad  for  the
broad protection of property rights—and so
can  hurt  the  efﬁciency, growth, and  the
health of the ﬁnancial system.

Such  adverse  long-term  effects  can  be
magniﬁed through crises, further dampen-
ing growth and reducing equity. Connected
lending  lowers  asset  quality  and  makes
ﬁnancial  systems  more  vulnerable. And
well-connected interests do disproportion-
ately  well  in  crises, through  looting  or
securing greater protection and bailouts, as

The liberalization paradox: 
Rapid and premature liberalization
can also be captured
A  seemingly  obvious  implication  of the
pathology  sketched  above  is  that  a  more
open  and 
liberalized  ﬁnancial  system
should be good for access, innovation, and
growth. Yet  overly  rapid  liberalization  can
bring  new  perils. Table  9.2  includes  exam-
ples  of liberalization  and  privatization  of
ﬁnancial systems leading to highly concen-
trated  beneﬁts. Rapid  privatizations  of
state-owned banks often meant that banks
went  to  powerful  insiders  or  corporate
groups, as in Chile in the 1970s, Mexico in
the 1980s, and the Russian Federation in the
1990s.9 In  Chile  and  Mexico, the  largest
banks  were  sold  to  a  small  number  of
wealthy  families  in  dubious  auctions, with
foreigners stopped from bidding. The buy-
ers were allowed to fund the purchases with
loans from the banks themselves, leading to
extremely  poor  incentives  for  solvency. In
both countries, the owners used the banks
to  grant  themselves  large  loans, aimed  in

B O X   9 . 2 Too much and too little regulation: 

Russia before and after the transition

Within a couple of years of liberalization, the
number of banks in Russia had risen from
four to around 3,000. One could argue that
this was prime evidence that no elite was
blocking entry. But such rapid entry in a reg-
ulatory power vacuum precluded any
chance of regulatory oversight. It compro-
mised the public perception of what a bank
is and how it operates, undermining the very
foundation required for the development of
the domestic banking sector. In practice,
many of these “banks”were not banks but
private fund management entities used to
channel capital ﬂight.Those raising deposits
from the general public lent the cash to
insiders, gambled it irresponsibly, or simply
shipped it abroad, leaving the banks as
empty shells full of liabilities.

Banks could get away with such behavior

not just because rapid entry overwhelmed
the (rather unprepared) regulators, but also
because the banking lobby further promoted

laws that granted banks an extraordinary
freedom to operate and dispose of other
people’s money.Russia endorsed the “univer-
sal bank”model, for example, hardly a struc-
ture suited to a legal and regulatory vacuum
(although there is debate as to whether this
was a key factor in itself).Bank lobbyists also
ensured that banks were exonerated from
the new commercial bankruptcy code (the
bankruptcy code established before the 1998
crisis vaguely stated that banks would be
subject to a speciﬁc bankruptcy legislation,
which was not even tabled before 1998).
The universal banking structure and
lack of bankruptcy system contributed to
the severity of the ﬁnancial crisis of August
1998, resulting in massive losses to deposi-
tors, foreign investors, and cost to the state
budget (as many liabilities were transferred
to the state-owned Sberbank).

part  at  accumulating  control  over  other
ﬁrms. In Mexico, this was associated with a
major consumer credit boom.

In the Republic of Korea, chaebols (fam-
ily-run  conglomerates)  came  to  dominate
nonbank ﬁnancial institutions. This caused
serious  conﬂicts  of interest  and “produced
numerous  incidents  of illegal  and  unfair
activities, where funds from afﬁliated ﬁnan-
cial institutions were exploited for the bene-
ﬁt of chaebol’s ailing subsidiaries.”10 And in
the particularly dramatic case of Russia, the
free-for-all  liberalization  was  a  source  of
both  rapid  concentration  of assets  and
increased ﬁnancial vulnerabilities (box 9.2).
Rapid  or  premature  liberalization  in  a
context  of low  political  accountability  can
increase  ﬁnancial  fragility, and  the  risk  of
opportunistic  default.11 Reckless  lending
strategies  in  Chile  and  Mexico  created
extreme  vulnerability  for  the  ﬁnancial  sys-
tem, which  collapsed  when  there  were
shocks  to  interest  and  exchange  rates. A
greater  percentage  of large  loans  defaulted
and  subsequent losses  on  large  loans  were
larger  than  losses  on  smaller  loans; losses
were  particularly  large  on  loans  to  parties
connected  with  the  owners, who  escaped
signiﬁcant sanctions. In both countries, the
banking  system  had  to  be  bailed  out  at
enormous  public  cost, while  much  of the
lent capital probably disappeared in capital
ﬂight, as in Russia. These cases suggest that
rash liberalization with limited scrutiny can
result in concentrated control of the bank-
ing system, with owners putting up limited
amounts of their own capital, and weak or
corrupt  supervision  and  public  guarantees
to  depositors. In  all  these  cases  the  rise  in
low-quality  liabilities  (and  the  associated
moral hazard) became a major factor in the
subsequent ﬁnancial crises.

In countries with greater accountability,
ﬁnancial  liberalizations  went  a  different
way. In  France, before  the  1985  ﬁnancial
reforms, government  subsidies  and  limits
on  competition  led  banks  to  support  less
productive  ﬁrms  and  provide  poor-quality
the  loan  allocations

ﬁnancial  crisis  or  capture  by  the  few. The
system was less concentrated to begin with,
and the reform process received more pub-
lic scrutiny.

Premature  or  ill-designed  liberalization
can also lead to reform backlash, if the ben-
eﬁts  are  perceived  to  be  concentrated  in  a
few  powerful  groups  while  the  losses  are
broadly socialized. There is less speciﬁc evi-
dence on this for the ﬁnancial system, but it
forms part of a broader pattern of reaction
against  liberalizing  processes. Witness  the
dramatic fall in support for privatization in
Latin America between the mid-1990s and
early 2000s (as documented by the Latino-
barómetro surveys). Such  a  backlash  is
likely to be particularly sharp when associ-
ated  with  gains  for  particular  groups—
”economically dominant minorities” in the
interpretation of a series of case studies by
Chua  (2004)—that  can  heighten  the  sense
of horizontal inequities for other groups. It
can undercut support for the very reforms
that are critical for equity and growth. This
is why policy designs need to consider both
technical and political economy concerns.

Increasing access to ﬁnancial services:
Technical design, accountability,
and competition
If both ﬁnancial systems and ﬁnancial liber-
alizations are often captured, what does this
imply for the design of reform? The answer is
complex and to some degree speciﬁc to the
initial  ﬁnancial  and  legal  institutions  and
political  context  of a  country. But  we  can
outline some general principles. Options to
expand access entail moving ﬁnancial insti-
tutions closer to the country’s “access possi-
bilities  frontier.” This  will  not  necessarily
imply  ﬁnance  for  all: for  all  the  success  of
microcredit for the poor, the major beneﬁci-
aries  of greater  access  will  be  small  and
medium  entrepreneurs  from  the  middle
class. But  this  is  good  for  the  broad-based
growth  that  will  beneﬁt  all  groups. This
involves both issues of technical design and
developing the political and social account-
abilities that will support and sustain change.

Technical design issues. For ﬁnancial institu-
tions, expanding the client base has much to

do with scale, which is often too small. Recent
experiences like those of ICICI bank in India
show that the high transaction costs for small
volumes  and  the  large  cost  of expanding
reach  can  be  overcome. One  option  is  the
innovative  use  of existing  networks. Postal
systems, with  their  broad  coverage, can  be
used to deliver new services by many private
ﬁnancial services providers. Many technolog-
ical solutions now exist for small-scale bank-
ing, from mobile banking to broadening the
range  of delivery  points—through  kiosks,
small branches, and joint ventures with non-
banks. Simpler  banking  products, like  the
“Mzansi” account  in  South Africa, and  pre-
paid  cards  for  small  transactions  can  lower
costs. Handheld  computers  have  been  used
for  quick  approval  of microﬁnance  loans.
Reverse  factoring  (lending  on  the  basis  of
receivables  from  a  creditworthy  institution)
using  an  Internet  platform  has  allowed
Nacional  Financiera  (NAFIN)  in  Mexico  to
extend  trade  ﬁnance. There  has  also  been
much innovation in the market for interna-
tional  remittances, which  many  banks  have
entered.

Some of these innovations need regula-
tory changes—for example, customer iden-
tiﬁcation, anti-money-laundering rules and
other  rules  can  hinder  access  to  a  bank
account, as when individuals do not have a
ﬁxed  address  or  formal  job. Better  regula-
tory approaches for consumers can involve
adopting  “truth  in  lending” requirements
for  small  borrowers  and  educating  people
on  the  risks  of (new)  ﬁnancial  services.
However, a  general  lesson  is  to  be  wary  of
regulation  in  weak  environments: all  too
often regulation ostensibly designed to pro-
tect  savers  and  borrowers  is  ineffective  in
protection but still hinders access.

Are  there  shortcuts  to  enhancing  access,
especially when overall institutional improve-
ments  will  take  time?  Too  often  there  is
emphasis  on  the  more  complicated  and
sophisticated  aspects  of ﬁnancial  systems,
while, some of the basics—broadening access
to ﬁnancial services, including deposit-taking
institutions—can  be  more  important  from
an equity viewpoint. Information sharing can
help  improve  competition  in  banking  sys-
tems and can be encouraged more quickly in

some segments, including allowing nonbank
ﬁnancial  institutions  access  to  existing  net-
works (such as payments systems). There can
also  be  some  scope  for  speciﬁc  government
interventions. But government interventions
to  broaden  access  through  directed  credit
have typically been unsuccessful, causing inef-
ﬁcient distortions with few access beneﬁts—
the  second  type  of pathology  discussed  in
this chapter. Many governments, especially
in the 1960s and 1970s, used various forms
of
typically
through  state  banks, to  try  to  channel
ﬁnance  to  poor  farmers  and  small  enter-
prises. Directed  credit  undermines  institu-
tional development because banks have no
reason  to  develop  credit  analysis  skills, as
plentiful examples of defunct development
banks  show. By  one  account, default  rates
ranged  from  40  to  95  percent  throughout
the developing world.13

subsidized  directed  credit,

Moreover, subsidies for housing, lending
for small and medium enterprises, and agri-
cultural  ﬁnance  are  often  captured  by  the
well connected. Some schemes do reach the
poor: India’s social banking program did so,
but  at  a  high  cost.14 Such  schemes  then
become, at  best, an  inefﬁcient  means  of
support  for  the  poor, fostering  unsustain-
able  models  of ﬁnancial  sector  develop-
ment. For example, India’s Integrated Rural
Development  Program  provided  loans  to
socially excluded groups (certain castes and
tribes, and women) with high levels of sub-
sidy (25 to 50 percent of the loan volume to
such weak sectors). By 2000, loan recovery
was only 31 percent, and there was little evi-
dence of repeat borrowing.

Microﬁnance  clearly  has  a  role  in  ex-
panding access. It is best viewed as a com-
plement, not  a  substitute, for  more  equi-
table  ﬁnancial  reform  and  core  ﬁnancial
system  development. In  most  countries,
microcredit and similar microﬁnance insti-
tutions reach less than 2 percent of the pop-
ulation. Only  in  a  few  countries  is  access
really  extensive—Bangladesh,
Indonesia,
and  Sri  Lanka  stand  out  with  coverage
ratios  in  the  order  of 8  percent  or  more.15
Subsidies  are  often  used  to  encourage  the
setup of microﬁnance institutions, but they
need to be designed carefully because they

can increase ﬁnal costs, by encouraging the
formation of institutions that are too small
and that are forced to raise prices to recover
ﬁxed costs. Co-sharing costs and risks with
the private sector is a key market test. Start-
up  subsidies  and  other  support  can  foster
exploration of alternative business models,
phasing out support over time. Maintaining
a  segmented  system  makes  sense  until  the
microﬁnance sector matures, with stronger
microﬁnance  institutions  coming  into  the
core ﬁnancial system as they evolve.

Accountability  and  competition. Technical
design is important, but the core of a reli-
able reform is building political and regula-
tory  accountability. Public  scrutiny  has  a
key role, given the risks of capturing reform
process and institutions. Potential actors to
help  oversee  the  process  include  associa-
tions  of small  ﬁrms, consumer  groups,
NGOs, media, and labor unions. But given
the technical and complex nature of ﬁnan-
cial  sector  functioning, societal  accounta-
bility is likely to be most effective if groups
with  an  interest  in  a  more  open  ﬁnancial
system are empowered, engaging independ-
ent nongovernmental technical bodies with
the capacity to analyze ﬁnancial sector con-
ditions. The  shadow  regulatory  commis-
sions established in almost all regions, and
such research centers as the recently formed
Center for Financial Stability in Argentina,
can be sources of education and avenues for
interest groups to express their voice. It will
remain  important  to  design  these  mecha-
nisms with care to avoid the creation of veto
powers  to  reform  (which  can  lead  to
counter-reform capture!)

It  is  possible  to  promote  reforms  that
build  more  reliable  and  inclusive  ﬁnancial
systems  in  a  context  of unequal  inﬂuence.
Formal  regulatory  structures  can  comple-
ment  societal  accountability. The  develop-
ment of the stock markets in Poland and the
Czech  Republic  show  what  regulation  and
disclosure  can  do. At  the  transition  from
communism  in  1989, these  two  countries
were quite similar in economic structure and
history. But  the  design  of ﬁnancial  reforms
was very different, driven primarily by differ-
ences in philosophy toward markets.16

The  Czech  Republic  went  for  a  radical
voucher-based privatization of state-owned
assets, convinced of the power of the mar-
ket  to  organize  itself: with  property  rights
transferred  to  the  private  sector,
it  was
expected  that  private  actors  would  efﬁ-
ciently  contract  with  one  another. Poland
pursued a more gradual approach, based on
case-by-case  privatization  and  a  measured
institutional  development  effort  to  build
regulatory and supervisory capacity. Com-
pany  and  securities  laws  in  the  two  coun-
tries reﬂected these differences in approach,
with much greater requirements in Poland
than in the Czech Republic for disclosure to
the  public, more  protection  of minority
shareholders, and more power for the inde-
pendent regulator.

The  results  were  quite  different. The
stock market in the Czech Republic started
bigger  but  was  quickly  dominated  by  cor-
porate  insiders, who  captured “58  percent
of the values of companies over and above
their  legitimate  shareholding, compared
with  an  insigniﬁcant  1  percent  in  the
United  States.”17 There  was  widespread
“tunneling,” a  form  of asset  stripping  by
insiders  through  transfers  to  other  institu-
tions they controlled. The Polish stock mar-
ket, by  contrast, started  more  slowly, but
then overtook the Czech market (ﬁgure 9.1)
Public  scandals  led  to  the  regulator  effec-
tively pursuing violations, using the greater
legal  protections, and  laying  the  basis  for
more  broad-based  property  rights, greater
conﬁdence, and openness. By the late 1990s,
there  were  already  several  initial  public
offerings in the market.

Segmentation  provides  another  example
of the  need  for  appropriate  accountability
mechanisms. Financial  sector  regulation  in
many  countries, including  developed  ones,
enforced  segmentation  for  long  periods—
both  on  a  geographic  basis  and  by  type  of
ﬁnancial  services, as  among  commercial
banking, investment banking, and insurance.
The  Italian  experience  with  dispersed  local
banking  suggests  that  mutual  and  coopera-
tive banks performed an important function
in  supporting  local  activities, which  was
much  better  than  state-owned  banks  or
banks dominated by politicians.18 But regu-

latory  capacity  has  been  eroded  by  techno-
logical  change. Given  that  segmentation
often  resulted  in  capture  by  local  elites, the
erosion of barriers has likely improved access
as often as not. Yet there is room for smaller,
locally  managed  intermediaries  to  promote
access. Such  locally  focused  intermediaries
need  explicit  disclosure  and  accountability
requirements  to  local  users  (as  opposed  to
local politicians), which has been the tradi-
tion in cooperative or mutual banks, to limit
the undue political inﬂuence of the few.

Opening the ﬁnancial sector to competi-
tion from foreign ﬁnancial institutions can
also  spur  ﬁnancial  broadening. Foreign
bank entry can help by improving efﬁciency
and  stability, reducing  protected  proﬁts,
and forcing (local) ﬁnancial institutions to
focus more on providing ﬁnancial services
to  all. Financing  obstacles  are  perceived  to
be  much  lower  by  borrowers  in  countries
with  high  levels  of foreign  bank  penetra-
tion, with  evidence  that  even  small  enter-
prises  beneﬁt. But  note  that  allowing  the
entry  of foreign  banks  is  not  synonymous
with capital account liberalization. Rapidly
opening  the  capital  account  before  ade-
quate domestic regulatory and supervisory
structures  are  in  place  can  be  dangerous,
especially  in  a  world  of large, and  often
herdlike, international  capital  ﬂows, cou-
pled  with  politically  connected  lending  of
poor quality. This increased the vulnerabil-
ity of Indonesia, the Republic of Korea, and
Thailand in the East Asian crisis.

Finally there is the potential for external
commitment. The  relative  success  of Cen-
tral  European  countries  in  strengthening
accountability  has  been  attributed  to  the
constraint on abuse induced by the need to
prepare  for  accession  to  the  European
Union. In Slovakia, after a decade of inﬂu-
ence-peddling  and  slow  reform  in  the
ﬁnancial  sector,
the  pendulum  swung
toward reform only as the date of possible
EU accession approached.19

Achieving equity and efﬁciency
in labor markets
For  most  of the  world’s  people, economic
opportunities are primarily determined, or

186

WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2006

at least mediated, by the labor market—in
formal  and  informal  work. The  wages  and
employment conditions in the labor market
affect the quality of life of workers and their
families, sometimes in ways that may seem
harsh  or  unfair. The  functioning  of the
labor  market  has  a  profound  effect  on
equity—across  workers,
in  patterns  of
access  to  work, and  between  workers  and
employers. Government 
to
achieve  greater  equity  is  frequent  in  labor
markets, but often with costs in terms of efﬁ-
ciency—exemplifying  the  second  pathology.
While this is an area in which genuine trade-
offs exist between protection of weaker work-
ers (which is good for equity) and ﬂexibility
(which is good for growth), elite capture and
gross inefﬁciencies can be addressed through
better design and broader accountability.

intervention 

Equity and efﬁciency reasons 
to intervene in the labor market
Labor markets are different from other mar-
kets. Unlike  the  markets  for  many  com-
modities, labor  markets  generally  are  not
competitive. They may be characterized by
uneven  market  power  (between  employers
and  workers), by  imperfect  mobility  of
workers, by insufﬁcient information, or by
discrimination. These imperfections gener-
ate  rents  in  the  employment  relationship,
which  both  sides  can  try  to  capture. This
can lead to unfair and inefﬁcient outcomes
when the bargaining position of the work-
ers  is  weak. For  example, employers  may
underpay  workers  who  are  not  mobile,
force workers to work in hazardous condi-
tions, or  discriminate  against  vulnerable
groups. Private markets, left to themselves,
also  do  a  poor  job  of protecting  workers
against  the  risk  of unemployment. In  the
absence  of perfect  access  to  ﬁnancial  mar-
kets, or complete insurance markets, work-
ers may not be able to smooth consumption
in response to labor income shocks. If they
cannot  gain  access  to  ﬁnancial  markets,
they  may  also  be  prevented  from  moving
from bad jobs to good.

All  governments,
income,
intervene heavily in the labor market. Gov-
ernments typically intervene to correct these

irrespective  of

failures: to protect workers and endow them
with  rights  and “voice” in  the  employment
relationship, to  empower  unions  to  repre-
sent  workers  in  negotiations  with  employ-
ers, to  ensure  compliance  with  labor  laws
and  regulations, and  to  provide  insurance
against  income  shocks. Public  intervention
can  improve  market  outcomes  and  lead  to
signiﬁcant equity gains: more equal oppor-
tunities  for  workers, better  working  condi-
tions, and  less  discrimination. It  can  also
lead to large gains in efﬁciency: for example,
by allowing full use of the labor of discrimi-
nated  groups, by  increasing  labor  mobility,
or by better managing income risk.20

The problem is that poorly designed or
inappropriate government intervention can
also make things worse, with results that are
bad for equity and efﬁciency. For example,
excessive protection of formal sector insid-
ers can lead to “rationing” jobs in the formal
sector, pushing  surplus  labor  into  either
informal  employment  (as  in  India) 21 or
unemployment (as in South Africa). 22

The  problem  is  particularly  acute  in
developing countries, because labor market
regulations  and  standards  typically  apply
only  to  formal  sector  workers, leaving  the
majority of the workforce uncovered.23 Pro-
tecting workers through legislation and reg-
ulation  that  is  enforced  only  in  the  formal
sector, without  other  measures  to  improve
working  conditions  in  informal  employ-
ment, can reinforce the segmentation between
formal  and  informal  employment  in  ways
that  are  inherently  unfair. In  Colombia,
workers are legally entitled to severance pay-
ments  for  dismissals  deemed  unjust, but
these  entitlements  are  not  enforced  in  the
informal  sector, which  employs  more  than
half the workforce. Not only do Colombian
informal sector workers not beneﬁt from the
legislation, but arguably they are harmed by
it, because the resulting higher cost of labor
in  the  formal  sector  limits  formal  employ-
ment  opportunities  for “outsiders” (mainly
women and youth).24

In reality, the distinction between formal
and informal employment is often blurred.
Some authors argue that the informal econ-
omy  functions  partly  as  an  unregulated
entrepreneurial  sector, often  voluntarily

entered  even  at  the  expense  of
lower
income.25 It is clear that the informal sector
is  heterogeneous, and  includes  both  those
who  choose  to  work  there  and  those  who
work there out of necessity. Those in the top
strata—microentrepreneurs  who  hire  oth-
ers and many of the self-employed—do rel-
atively well in average earnings. Those at the
bottom—intermittent  casual  laborers  and
industrial  outworkers—do  not. Women
tend  to  be  underrepresented  in  the  top
strata and overrepresented in the bottom.26
They  also  often  earn  less  than  men  within
each strata—although some of these differ-
ences  may  reﬂect  voluntary  choices  for
more  ﬂexible, part-time  work. In  a  recent
study,
the  International  Labour  Ofﬁce
(ILO) argued that the formal and informal
sectors are part of a continuum of working
conditions, earnings, and rights.27 A signiﬁ-
cant  share  of formal  sector  employees  had
some  of
the  (poor)  working  conditions
associated with informality, while a fraction
of informal  sector  workers  enjoyed  condi-
tions more typically associated with formal
sector jobs. The challenge for governments
is to shift more jobs along this continuum
toward  better  working  conditions  and
higher wages, and to do so in ways that do
not come at the expense of efﬁciency.

Indeed, poorly  designed  or  inappropri-
ate  government  intervention  can  also  be
inefﬁcient  and  bad  for  long-term  growth.
Recent research on India, for example, sug-
gests  that  starting  from  a  common  legal
framework  (the  Industries  Disputes Act  of
1947), the  states  that  amended  the  legisla-
tion in the direction of reinforcing security
rights of workers and other prolabor meas-
ures  had  lower  output  and  productivity
growth in formal manufacturing than those
that  did  not  change  it  or  that  made  labor
regulations  more  ﬂexible.28 Relatively  pro-
tective legislation may have reduced oppor-
tunities for workers—especially the major-
ity without a formal sector job.

A  look  at  some  African  labor  markets
illustrates  the  impact  of government  poli-
cies  (ﬁgure  9.2). Many  countries—includ-
ing  Ghana, Uganda, and  Tanzania—have
large self-employment sectors, which absorb
increases in the labor supply and help keep

unemployment low. South Africa stands in
sharp  contrast, with  a  small 
informal
sector—absorbing only about 19 percent of
the  total  workforce  in  2002, much  lower
than  the  share  of nonagricultural  employ-
ment in other African countries—and high
unemployment (42 percent in 2003).29 Part
of the story lies in much larger wage differ-
ences  between  formal  and  informal  sector
work  in  South  Africa  than  in  the  other
cases. But it also appears to be caused by the
unusually small size of the informal sector
(compared  with  Latin  America, for  exam-
ple). Some  suggest  that  the  legacy  of
apartheid that inhibited the development of
traditions  of
small-scale  entrepreneurial
activity, and  labor  regulations  that  are
enforced for ﬁrms of all sizes (depending on
the  industry  and  region), may  explain  the
lack  of entrepreneurs  and  small  ﬁrms  in
South Africa.

In Ethiopia, on the other hand, the major-
ity  of the  urban  unemployed  are  well  edu-
cated  and  from  middle-class  households.30
They also tend to be young, have never held
paid  work, and  have  a  median  duration  of
unemployment of nearly four years. Indeed,
about  half of young  unemployed  males  are
searching for public sector jobs, which pay on
average  a  125  percent  premium  over  self-
employed work.

Addressing links with unequal power
Government intervention in the labor mar-
ket is often a reﬂection of the underlying dis-
tribution  of political  agency. Governments
may  (and  often  do)  intervene  in  the  labor
market  in  pursuit  of goals  other  than
addressing  market  failure. They  may  inter-
vene to buy off the support of certain groups
(for example, urban formal sector workers)
or  to  suppress  social  dissent  under  an
authoritarian regime or to serve the interests
of those with greater political inﬂuence. Oli-
garchic capitalist societies can be associated
either with labor repression or with union-
ized and (relatively) advantaged formal sec-
tor workers who share in the rents.

Interventions aimed at shifting aggregate
welfare  toward  politically  powerful  middle
groups, often in the name of equity, at the
expense  of others  (an  illustration  of our

188

second  pathology)  are  inherently  bad  for
equity and usually bad for efﬁciency. Politi-
cally  inﬂuential  energy  sector  and  teacher
unions  in  Mexico, for  example, have  pro-
tected their employment and wage entitle-
ments by blocking reforms that would lead
to, respectively, energy  sector  reform  and
higher-quality  and  more  equitable  school-
ing. Public  sector  workers  in  France  have
used their political force, with the aid of mas-
sive strikes, to curtail attempts to bring their
nonwage  beneﬁts  and  other  entitlements  in
line with those of the private sector.

Stronger  civil  and  political  rights  and
broader  mechanisms  for  voice  can  reduce
the  likelihood  that  the  government’s  labor
policy agenda will be hijacked by politically
powerful groups. There is a strong associa-
tion  between  democracy  and  the  level  of
wages, both  across  countries  and  within
societies  that  have  experienced  a  political
transition, such  as  the  Republic  of Korea,
and  Taiwan, China.31 Stronger  respect  for
civic rights in Latin America has also been
associated  with  greater  formalization  of
employment and a higher wage share.32 In
Spain, the  transition  to  democracy  in  the
mid-1970s  led  to  demands  for  greater
equity  that  were  associated  with  the  legal-
ization  of free  trade  unions,33 the  rapid

introduction  of extensive  social  transfers
(including  pensions  and  unemployment
insurance), and the implementation of pro-
gressive  income  taxation. The  result  was  a
shift  from  a  regulated  state, in  which  pro-
tection  for  workers  came  mainly  through
permanent  jobs  and  controlled  housing
rentals, to  a  liberal  economy  with  ﬂexible
markets, and  more  extensive  public  provi-
sioning of services (see focus 3 on Spain).

Better design: Can labor market
institutions be designed to be 
pro-growth and pro-equity?
The challenge for governments is to design
interventions  that  balance  equity  and  efﬁ-
ciency goals in ways that are within a coun-
try’s institutional capacity. History suggests
that this is a complex task, and there are real
tradeoffs that need to be assessed. Different
societies are likely to make different choices.
Scandinavia  and  the  United  States  have
very  different  sets  of labor  market  institu-
tions, yet they share a good track record of
solid  growth  and  high  employment-to-
population  ratios  (ﬁgure  9.3). The  Nordic
countries have mandated generous beneﬁts
and  protection  for  workers, ﬁnanced  by  a
high tax effort. But they also have a highly
coordinated  and  centralized  approach  to
wage-setting  and  policymaking, which
allowed all parties to internalize the conse-
quences  of their  actions, with  the  union
movement  historically  an  advocate  for
openness  and  competition. The  United
States leaves the setting of wages and work
conditions, including  beneﬁts, much  more
to discretion and employer-worker negotia-
tion. This  ﬁts  well  within  its  tradition  of
decentralized  bargaining, which  gives  free-
dom  to  individual  ﬁrms  to  bargain  with
their  workers  in  response  to  their  varying
economic and ﬁnancial conditions. It leads
to greater wage inequality and more work-
ers  without  health  and  other  forms  of
insurance. But  it  is  consistent  with  lower
taxes  and  high  levels  of ﬂexibility.34 The
Nordic  countries  and  the  United  States
opted for different labor market models (in
line  with  their  history, legal  tradition, and
societal  preferences), but  all  succeeded  in
delivering  to  their  workforces  a  large  pool

Markets and the macroeconomy

of job  opportunities, productivity  growth,
and rising incomes over the long term.

What  doesn’t  work? There  are  also  many
ways  of getting  labor  market  institutions
“wrong.” And when countries get it wrong,
one segment of the labor market (typically
public and formal sector workers who rep-
resent the middle and high end of the usage
distribution) beneﬁts from extra protection
at  the  expense  of others. Outcomes  are
highly  unequal, and  the  costs  to  efﬁciency
and growth are usually severe. The experi-
ences of India, South Africa, and Colombia
cited earlier are vivid examples.

Governments  also  get  it  wrong  if they
intervene  extensively  in  the  labor  market
when product markets are not competitive.
A  typical  example  is  the  unionization  of
public sector workers. In Mexico, before the
reforms of the 1990s, workers in public util-
ities  and  in  the  public  oil  sector  secured
high wages by capturing a share of the rents
generated in these monopolistic sectors. But
their  gain  came  at  a  cost  for  employment
and  competitiveness  in  Mexico’s  private
sector. Mexico’s experience is not unique: it
applied  equally  to  state  enterprise  workers
in Turkey until the 1990s and to public sec-
tor workers in India and many other coun-
tries.

Things  can  also  go  greatly  wrong  when
governments  mandate  protection  with  no
attention to incentives. In much of Europe,
governments implemented generous unem-
ployment beneﬁts with little connection to
workers’ actual  job  search  behavior. The
result  was  an  increase  in  the  duration  of
unemployment and the emergence of long-
term  unemployment, with  its  destructive
impact on human capital, loss of employa-
bility, weakened ties to economic and social
life, and for many, high degrees of poverty
and social exclusion.35

What works? The key to avoiding these pit-
falls is achieving a balance between protec-
tion and ﬂexibility. Design speciﬁcs matter
a lot, as does the underlying structural con-
text. Collective  organization  of workers  is
one of the main channels for securing bet-
ter and more equitable working conditions.
Free trade unions are the cornerstone of any

effective  system  of
industrial  relations.
Unions act as agents for labor, coordinating
the  demands  of workers  and  organizing
them  into  a  single  entity  whose  collective
bargaining  power  matches  that  of
the
employer. Trade unions can help provide a
positive  work  environment  by  reducing
labor  turnover  and  by  promoting  worker
training  and  higher  productivity. Unions
have  also  been  found  to  reduce  inequality
and  wage  discrimination  in  countries  as
diverse  as  Ghana, the  Republic  of Korea,
Mexico, and Spain.36 Unions also can have
an important noneconomic role. They have
been  a  force  for  progressive  political  and
social  change  in  many  countries  (Poland,
the Republic of Korea, and South Africa).

But the involvement of unions in wage-
setting  can  also  have  signiﬁcant  negative
economic effects. Evidence from industrial
societies  suggests  that  union  involvement
reduces  the  employment  of young  and
older  workers  (“outsiders”)  and  beneﬁts
prime-age  males  and  females.37 Unions
often act as monopolists, improving wages
and  work  conditions  for  their  members  at
the  expense  of consumers  and  nonunion
labor. For example, recent studies of manu-
facturing  wages  in  Africa  show  substantial
union wage premiums (30 to 40 percent in
some countries).38

Formal trade unions are most effective at
improving  conditions  for  workers  without
huge efﬁciency costs when product markets
are competitive, so that unions cannot raise
wages for their members by capturing rents
at  the  expense  of other  parts  of society;
when  collective  bargaining  arrangements
and  institutions  have  enough  ﬂexibility  to
accommodate different demand and supply
conditions  for  different  types  of workers;
and when unions operate in a context that
allows  them  to  internalize  and  absorb  the
cost  of their  actions. On  the  other  hand,
when unions are co-opted by political elites
or by the state, their actions can have signif-
icant costs for efﬁciency.

An  illustration  of the  potentially  highly
positive role of unions in improving working
conditions  while  supporting  productivity
growth comes from a study of worker-ﬁrm
relationships  in  high-value  export  crops  in

B O X   9 . 3 Organizing in the informal economy

Developing countries have trade unions
and large informal economies, two
phenomena commonly thought to be
incompatible. But recent work by Women in
Informal Employment: Globalizing and
Organizing (WIEGO) has uncovered a sur-
prising amount of organizing in the infor-
mal economy. Formal trade unions that
extend their coverage to informal workers
and trade unions of informal workers are
two organizational forms that have
emerged. Organizing can also be done by
cooperatives, savings-and-credit groups,
producer groups, and neighborhood and
trade associations.

Organizing in the informal economy

differs from organizing in the formal econ-
omy along several dimensions. Collective
bargaining can take many forms. Bargain-
ing partners are not just employers but can
also include municipal authorities, police,
wholesalers, and other interest groups.
Activities of informal workers’ trade unions
can also extend beyond collective bargain-
ing and include a range of services, such as
savings, credit, social security, and
advocacy. Because members do not work in
a standard workplace or for a single
employer, membership in trade unions can
take unusual forms.

• Registered as a trade union, the Self-

Employed Women’s Association (SEWA)
in India is both an organization of poor
self-employed women workers and a
movement combining elements of the
labor, cooperative, and women’s move-
ments. It offers a broad range of services
to its nearly 700,000 members, including
banking, health care, child care,
insurance, legal aid, housing assistance,
and capacity building (www.sewa.org).

• StreetNet International, launched in 2002

in South Africa, has 15 afﬁliates (unions,
cooperatives, or associations) in Asia,
Africa, and Latin America that organize
street vendors, informal market vendors,
and hawkers. As of early 2004, these afﬁli-
ates represented 128,000 members
(UNRISD Gender Policy Report).

• HomeNet Thailand is a network that
helps organize informal home-based
subcontracted and own-account workers
(mainly women). It drew attention to the
plight of these workers following the
ﬁnancial crisis in 1998.

nizing (2005).

northeastern  Brazil. Union  activity  among
landless agricultural laborers in this case was
an  important  factor  behind  improvements
in  work  practices  that  led  to  higher  quality
(critical for export crops), higher productiv-
ity, and better working conditions for land-
less workers. To effect this change, however,
the  union  had  to  shift  from  defending  the
interests  of its  traditional  base  of support
(small farmers) to representing the interests
of a larger group of landless laborers. Success
was  also  facilitated  by  the  fact  that, on  the
employer  side, the  union  was  negotiating
with  large  ﬁrms  from  southeastern  Brazil.
These southeastern ﬁrms had experience in
collective  bargaining,
in  contrast  to  the
more traditional large farmers of the north-
east, which  were  accustomed  to  more
repressive and conﬂictive labor relations.39
Collective  organization  of workers  can
also  secure  greater  bargaining  power  and
thus better working conditions for informal
economy  workers. Studies  of
informal

worker associations in India, South Africa,
and Thailand suggest that organizing infor-
mal  workers  decreases  the  workers’ invisi-
bility to policymakers and legislators, helps
them gain access to information, gives them
voice  and  self-identity, and  in  some  cases
helps to provide them with a range of social
protection services (box 9.3).

Providing  income  security  is  another
area  in  which  the  structural  context  and
design  speciﬁcs, which  pay  attention  to
incentives  and  reward  desirable  behaviors,
are  critical  to  policy  outcomes  (box  9.4).
This is also true of minimum wage policies
for  which  the  key  to  avoiding  large  efﬁ-
ciency costs is to get the level right and to
allow for enough ﬂexibility across types of
workers to accommodate different demand
and supply elasticities for their labor.40

Design  speciﬁcs  and  the  broader  struc-
tural context are equally critical to the suc-
cess  of legislation  on  other  work  standards
(health and safety) or protection for speciﬁc
vulnerable  groups  (such  as  child  laborers,
ethnic minorities, or the disabled). There is
an  international  consensus  that  core  labor
standards—freedom  from  forced  and  child
labor, freedom from discrimination at work,
freedom  of association, and  the  right  to
collective  bargaining—have  such  intrinsic
value  that  they  should  always  be  pursued.
But even for these core standards there are
questions about how to achieve them most
effectively and with minimum cost.41

An  example  of government  interven-
tion to protect workers from abuse comes
from Cambodia’s successful experience with
implementing  core  labor  standards  in  the
garment industry. Starting in 1999 Cambodia
could earn a higher quota for exports to the
United  States  by  demonstrating  improve-
ments in working conditions. A monitoring
system—developed and implemented by the
ILO, with support from the U.S. Department
of Labor, the Government of Cambodia, and
the  Garment  Manufacturers  Association  of
Cambodia—has  virtually  eliminated  the
worst  labor  abuses, such  as  child  labor  and
sexual  harassment. A  recent  survey  showed
enforcement  of core  labor  standards  in  the
garment  sector  has  boosted  Cambodian
exports to Europe and North America.42 But

B O X   9 . 4 Employment protection legislation

Left to itself, the labor market does a poor job of
protecting workers against a sharp loss in income
associated with unemployment. As a result, most
societies have developed ways to cope with the
threat of job loss. Often this involves some com-
bination of informal support mechanisms, private
savings, and obligations on employers.When
these mechanisms break down—as they do
when the shocks are large, sudden, protracted, or
affect an entire community—the government
needs to step in. Government intervention typi-
cally involves one or several of the following
instruments: job security regulations, mandated
severance pay, unemployment insurance, or
mandatory self-insurance mechanisms.

Job security legislation is typically aimed at
protecting jobs and preventing job destruction.
Most evidence suggests that it is quite effective
at doing so. Across countries, more stringent
employment protection legislation (EPL) appears
strongly associated with more stable
employment. But EPL reduces job destruction at
a signiﬁcant cost, as the expectation of high sep-
aration costs makes ﬁrms more reluctant to
expand employment, and makes it less
proﬁtable to start new ventures or create new
ﬁrms. So, employment protection also reduces
job creation. For example, researchers found that
strict new job-security laws enacted in the 1980s
reduced employment in many industries in Zim-

babwe (Fallon and Lucas 1993). Overall, the net
effect of job security legislation on employment
is ambiguous (Bertola 1990; OECD 1999; Bertola,
Blau, and Kahn 2001; Kugler 2004).

What is clear is that EPL changes the nature

of unemployment. Lower job destruction
reduces the incidence of unemployment. But
lower job creation increases the duration of
unemployment and can lead to the emergence
of long-term unemployment.

Not surprisingly, EPL appears to have a dif-
ferent impact on different groups of workers. In
both Colombia and Spain the reduction of dis-
missal costs and job security provisions was
associated with moderate increases in the
employment of young men and women (Kugler
2004; Kugler, Jimeno, and Hernanz 2003). For
Chile, Montenegro and Pagés 2004 ﬁnd that job
security regulations reduce the employment
rate of youth and the unskilled to the beneﬁt of
older and more skilled workers. A study across
the countries of the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development arrives at a sim-
ilar conclusion: consistent with the story that
EPL protects “insiders,” stricter EPL increases the
employment of adult men and reduces that of
young workers and women (OECD 1999).

Given the complex effects of EPL, how can

governments best intervene to help protect
workers against temporary drops in income

associated with unemployment? Some EPL may
be efﬁcient, reducing excessive volatility in
turnover. But too strong EPL—as is typical of
many formal sectors in the developing world—
slows the pace of creative destruction central to
innovation and growth, with disproportionate
adverse effects on those without “good” jobs.Yet
reducing EPL needs to be complemented by
greater worker security that is not linked to spe-
ciﬁc jobs, both on social welfare and political
economy grounds.

The design of the optimal solution depends
on the institutional and administrative capacity
of government and on the structural characteris-
tics of the labor market (Blanchard 2004). Coun-
tries with signiﬁcant administrative capacity and
medium to high incomes can implement unem-
ployment insurance systems with incentives for
job search (declining beneﬁts with duration and
provision of beneﬁts conditional on acceptance
of acceptable job offer). Middle-income
countries reluctant to implement a full-blown
unemployment insurance system can support
self-insurance mechanisms, such as mandatory
savings accounts (but because of the limits to
self-insurance, these are not as effective). Low-
income countries can opt for public works
schemes, which if effectively designed are self-
targeting and can be implemented even when
levels of informality are high (chapter 7).

whether the system will survive the end of the
U.S. quota incentives remains to be seen (see
chapter 10).

How to reform a “bad” set 
of labor market institutions
Reforming  labor  market  institutions  is
technically  and  politically  difficult. It  is
technically  difficult  because  reforms  need
to be coordinated across a variety of labor
market  institutions, and  often  also  with
reforms  outside  the  labor  market. It  is
politically  difficult  because  there  usually
are vested interests in maintaining the sta-
tus quo. Moreover, the short-term costs of
reform can be large and unevenly distrib-
uted. Take reforms to reduce employment
protection: those  currently  protected  see
themselves  as  having  much  more  to  lose
from  reform  than  to  gain  from  such  a
reduction. And  if they  are  also  politically
influential—represented  by  unions  and
with political voice—their power to block

reforms  may  be  an  insurmountable  bar-
rier.

Several  countries  have 

implemented
substantial  labor  market  reforms  more  or
less  successfully: Ireland, the  Republic  of
Korea, the  Netherlands, New  Zealand, and
the  Slovak  Republic  among  OECD  coun-
tries; Chile and Colombia among develop-
ing countries (see box 9.5 for Colombia and
the Slovak Republic). China is in the midst
of a  large  labor  market  transition, and  the
Balkans  are  struggling  through  dramatic
labor market reforms.

Experience suggests that effective change
involves a combination of factors: designing
and  implementing  a  consistent  and  com-
prehensive  policy  package; tackling  vested
interests; broadening  societal  accountabil-
ity, including increasing the voice of poorer
groups; and, in  some  cases, compensating
losers. Macroeconomic and ﬁnancial shocks
can facilitate change, although not always a
positive one. Reforming institutions in the

B O X   9 . 5 Two cases of labor market reform: one comprehensive, one partial 

Comprehensive reform in the Slovak
Republic
In 2000 unemployment in the Slovak Republic
reached 19 percent of the labor force—the high-
est in the OECD at that time.The main factor was
the substantial job reallocation generated by the
transition to a market economy, compounded by
low labor mobility because of skill and regional
mismatches. But the impact of the transition
shock on the labor market was worsened by an
inadequate set of institutions: high rates of taxa-
tion of labor and overly generous unemployment
beneﬁt and social assistance systems, which dis-
couraged job search and encouraged informality.
Reforming these institutions in the midst of

high unemployment was extremely difﬁcult,
particularly for a reformist government with a
small majority in parliament. But in early 2003,
bolstered by its reelection, the reformist Slovak
government undertook a comprehensive and
ambitious reform of social and labor market pol-
icy.The government’s multipronged strategy
combined measures to reduce the taxation of
labor, increase the incentives to work through
reform of unemployment insurance and social
assistance, invest in the skills of labor and
employability, improve the matching of workers

and jobs through higher labor ﬂexibility and
mobility, and strengthen state administration in
labor and social policy.

The new strategy represented a marked

change in philosophy in labor and social policy
in the Slovak Republic: from a system that mixed
ingredients of insurance and redistribution
toward one that separates social insurance from
equity objectives; and from a tradition of entitle-
ments based on subjective or “moral” norms to
one that guarantees a certain living standard to
all citizens irrespective of the reason they may
have for being poor, but that rewards individual
initiative and motivation.

The key ingredients in pushing the reform
through were a reformist government with a
strong popular mandate; strong leadership and
technical competency from the Ministry of
Labor and Social Affairs; accession into the Euro-
pean Union as a disciplining device; and wide-
spread public perception, built on analysis and
dissemination of this analysis, that institutional
reforms were needed. Moreover, labor market
reform was carried out not in isolation but as
part of a broader policy package to make the
Slovak economy more competitive in light of EU
accession.This package included a substantial

overhaul of personal income taxes, as well as
reform of the education system.

Partial labor market reform in Colombia
In 1990 Colombia introduced a labor market
reform that substantially reduced the costs of
dismissing workers.The reform reduced sever-
ance payments, widened the deﬁnition of “just”
dismissals, extended the use of temporary con-
tracts, and speeded up the process of mass dis-
missals.The joint effects of these reforms were
to reduce the costs associated with ﬁring work-
ers in ﬁrms covered by the legislation. But the
reforms did not affect informal sector ﬁrms,
which did not comply with the legislation.

An analysis of the effects of the reforms sug-

gests that they did increase the dynamism of
the Colombian labor market by increasing exit
rates into and out of unemployment (greater
churning).There was an increase in worker
turnover for formal sector worker, greatest
among young workers, more educated workers,
and workers employed in larger ﬁrms.The
reforms may have also contributed to increasing
compliance with labor legislation by reducing
the costs of formality.

midst  of widespread  job  loss  and  high
unemployment (as in the Republic of Korea
following the 1998 ﬁnancial crisis) is partic-
ularly difﬁcult, even though it may be easier
at such times to achieve societal consensus
for reform.

Designing  a  consistent  and  coherent  policy
package. One of the strongest lessons from
country experience is that piecemeal reform
does not work (tinkering at the margin usu-
ally  has  perverse  distributional  effects).
Moreover, reforms need to cover a range of
labor market policies and to be linked with
reforms 
in  social  protection  systems.
Reform  is  more  effective  and  more  equi-
table  when  different  labor  market  instru-
ments are coordinated: measures to reduce
insider  power  and  increase  ﬂexibility  by
lowering the restrictions and costs of ﬁring
can  be  linked  to  setting  up  of unemploy-
ment insurance mechanisms and eliminat-
ing dual status contracts. Reforms in other
markets and the public sector are often key
to the success of labor market reform. The

depth and competitiveness of other markets
(including  product  and  ﬁnancial  markets)
are critical.

Tackling vested interests. Reforms  are  often
held  hostage  by  politically  more  powerful
groups. For  example, policies  to  reduce
employment protection, allow for submini-
mum wages, or streamline and improve pub-
lic  sector  employment  typically  encounter
sharp resistance from unions. Building broad
societal  consensus  for  reform  is  often  the
only way to tackle these vested interests. As a
ﬁrst step, this may require documenting the
high  costs  of bad  labor  market  policies
through  good  data  collection, analysis, and
dissemination (as in the Slovak Republic).

Broadening  social  accountability. Building
societal consensus in support of labor market
reform  may  require  speciﬁc  measures  to
empower the groups of so-called outsiders or
disenfranchised  workers  who  bear  the  costs
of nonreform. It helps to have political parties
and  societal  organizations  with  broad  bases

Markets and the macroeconomy

of representation and support. When this is
not the case, it may be necessary to look for
ways to open up institutions and give greater
voice in bargaining (at all levels) to represen-
tatives  of disenfranchised  groups. This  is
easier  when  there  are  democratic  local  gov-
ernments  and  strong  autonomous  associa-
tions—independent private business associa-
tions, worker associations that represent the
interests  of speciﬁc  groups, and  so  on. The
independent  private  sector  is  also  a  natural
ally when it comes to reforming public sector
employment and wage practices.

Compensating  losers. The  short-term  costs
of reforms can be high for certain groups of
workers: unemployment insurance and social
assistance reform in the Slovak Republic dis-
proportionately  hurt  Roma  workers  and
those living in high unemployment regions.
So it may be necessary to compensate the los-
ers. It is best to do this in ways that address
the obstacles that losers face in reentering the
labor market (support for education or train-
ing)  or  that  facilitate  labor  mobility  and
reward  work  incentives  (transport  vouchers
for workers moving from social assistance to
work). Such  compensatory  measures  have
been introduced as part of the Slovak Repub-
lic’s labor market reform package.

Product markets and trade reform
Product  markets  are  intimately  related  to
equity, with two-way patterns of causation:
product  markets  shape  the  distribution  of
economic opportunities, and inequalities in
inﬂuence shape the functioning of product
markets. Both  the  design  of external  trade
policy and the workings of internal product
markets  reﬂect  patterns  of inﬂuence. Re-
moving  barriers  and  excessive  regulation
needs to be complemented by measures to
expand skills, infrastructure, and safety nets
to achieve genuine access and help losers.

Market  broadening  and  deepening  are
central  to  the  expansion  of opportunity:
directly  for  ﬁrms  and  the  self-employed,
indirectly  for  workers. How  equitable  this
expansion  of opportunity  is  depends  on
interactions among external trade opening,
domestic  markets, patterns  of infrastruc-
ture, labor  markets, safety  nets, and  other

measures  to  improve  the  business  climate.
Product  market  and  trade  reforms  have
great  potential  to  bring  expansion 
in
opportunity, but  there  can  be  costs  in  the
short  to  medium  term, and  these  can  hit
particular groups, from relatively powerful
protected incumbents to middle and poorer
groups. The  costs  are  associated  with  how
markets  and  investment  processes  work:
labor is typically not fully mobile, new skills
take  time  to  acquire, and  new  investments
are  often  lumpy  and  can  take  time, espe-
cially when ﬁrms face imperfect credit mar-
kets  (see  earlier  section)  and  an  uncertain
investment environment.

The  functioning  of product  markets  is
embedded in political and social structures.
Elite capture ranges from the apparent and
egregious—as in the granting of the Indone-
sian  clove  monopoly  to  a  son  of President
Suharto (a monopoly since disbanded)—to
the less transparent shaping of trade policy
to protect the proﬁts of the inﬂuential. It is
also  true  that  policies  with  (genuine  or
rhetorical)  equitable  purpose  can  lead  to
outcomes that are bad for growth and mixed
for equity. This is evident in the characteris-
tically high levels of protection for relatively
labor-intensive manufacturing and for food
production (such as maize in Mexico, rice in
the  Republic  of Korea, and  the  infamous
agricultural  subsidies 
in  the  European
Union, Japan, and the United States). While
poorer  groups  sometimes  gain, it  is  more
common  that  middle  and  elite  groups  are
the  main  beneﬁciaries, while  food  con-
sumers lose out.

While policies that reduce the power of
incumbents  in  product  markets  will  typi-
cally  be  good  for  efﬁciency  and  equity, a
version of the “liberalization paradox” dis-
cussed earlier may often apply. Groups and
individuals  with  economic  capacity  and
political  inﬂuence  are  best  positioned  to
take  advantage  of market  opening. Under
some  conditions  this  can  lead  to  market
backlash. Chua (2004) documents cases of
“market-dominant minorities” who beneﬁt
from  free  market  reforms, including  trade
liberalization. Traditionally dominant eth-
nic  minorities, such  as  the  Chinese  in
Southeast  Asia,
in  West

194

the  marketization  of

Africa, and  whites  in  Latin  America  and
South Africa, seem to be the primary bene-
ﬁciaries  of
their
economies. Such  outcomes  can  fuel  deep-
seated  resentments  and  lead  to  violence.
These political economy and reform back-
lash  considerations  are  additional  reasons
for integrating attention to equity into the
design  of product  market  reforms  and
trade liberalization.

Trade liberalization
Trade liberalization changes relative prices
in  an  economy, causing  shifts  in  output,
wages, and employment. Analyses of trade
liberalization  are  primarily  about  out-
comes, providing only indirect evidence on
opportunities. They show that trade open-
ness  is  positively  associated  with  growth
and, on average, there are no strong corre-
lations  with  income  distribution. Morley
(2001), using  data  from  Latin  America,
found slightly negative effects of trade lib-
eralization  on  income  distribution, while
Behrman, Birdsall, and  Székely  (2003)
found  positive  inﬂuences  of trade  liberal-
ization  on  wage  inequality. Another  study
using  panel  data  for  41  countries  found
that  trade  openness  is  associated  with
increases in inequality, after controlling for
a  set  of other  structural  and  policy  inﬂu-
ences.43

These average effects mask a great deal of
diversity  in  impacts  across  groups, espe-
cially over the short to medium term. The
impact  of
trade-induced  price  changes
depends not only on average pass-through
but also on exactly which prices change and
how  producers  and  consumers  respond.44
For  example, the  effects  of removing  pro-
tection  for  agriculture  will  depend  on
whether  agricultural  prices  subsequently
rise  or  fall  and  whether  the  poor  are  net
producers  or  consumers  of disprotected
products. Normally, it is assumed that trade
liberalization  in  agriculture  will  beneﬁt
poor  small-scale  farmers  and  be  good  for
equity. After all, “developing countries have
traditionally  taxed  the  agricultural  sector
while  developed  countries  have  protected
it.”45 But the impacts must be analyzed case
by case at the microlevel.

Cereal  protection  in  Morocco  offers  an
illustration. In  a  simulation  analysis  of
removal of wheat tariffs, Ravallion (2004b)
ﬁnds  that, contrary  to  expectations, rural
families  would  tend  to  lose  while  urban
ones would gain. Although the results pre-
dict that there would be more gainers than
losers  among  the  rural  poor, aggregate
losses  outweigh  aggregate  gains. Further-
more, expected  effects  would  be  enor-
mously  varied, with  signiﬁcant  horizontal
inequalities: households  with  the  same
incomes  were  predicted  to  experience
widely  differing  outcomes, depending  on
their  speciﬁc  structure  of production  and
consumption. Using  a  similar  simulation
analysis, China’s  accession  to  the  World
Trade  Organization  (WTO)  was  found  to
have  a  small  aggregate  poverty-reducing
effect, but  this  masked  considerable  varia-
tion  in  impacts  across  households  in  rural
versus  urban  areas  and  across  different
regions.46

While  aggregate  effects  of trade  reform
on  poverty  and  equity  are  not  always
clear—whether  diverse  impacts  translate
into  inequalities  in  opportunities  depends
on how new activities open up, and whether
labor  can  move  into  them—we  do  know
that there will be winners and losers. Out-
comes  depend  on  the  ability  and  willing-
ness  of governments  to  mitigate  losses  to
particularly  hard-hit  sectors, possibly  by
redistributing some of the gains accruing to
winners.

Domestic product markets and equity
Lack of competition among traders, remote
geography, poor  infrastructure, and  high
transport costs can all prevent the transmis-
sion  of border  price  changes  to  intended
reform beneﬁciaries. Addressing such prob-
lems  can  improve  the  impact  of
trade
reforms on equity.

The case of public or private marketing
agencies for export crops is a typical exam-
ple. Small farmers in many countries tradi-
tionally have had no option but to sell to a
marketing  agency  at  prices  substantially
lower than the free on board (f.o.b.) export
price. Legitimate  transport  and  marketing
costs  account  for  some  of the  price  differ-

ence, but monopsonistic proﬁts often do as
well. Marketing  agencies  can  thus  prevent
trade-induced price changes from reaching
farmers at all.47 A 1998 study found that the
Vietnamese  rice  marketing  system  was
controlled by a small number of state enter-
prises. These  enterprises  limited  the  trans-
mission of border price changes to farmers
and pushed up transaction costs.48 A more
extreme  example  was  when  marketing
boards  became  instruments  for  extraction
of surplus from agricultural exporters, such
as for cocoa farmers in the post-independ-
ence  period  in  Ghana. Malawi  has  faced
similar issues: cartels by companies buying
tea, sugar, and  tobacco  have  forced  down
the returns to farmers.49

Abolishing  marketing  boards  does  not
guarantee  efﬁcient  marketing, however,
they  may  play  a  useful  role  when  markets
are  thin, or  a  tradition  of trading  has  not
developed, as  in  the  raw  cashew  export
market in Mozambique. Although the state
trading company was privatized in the late
1980s, there  was  insufﬁcient  competition
among private marketers when raw cashew
export  restrictions  were  lifted  in  the  early
1990s. Indeed, raw  cashews  had  to  move
through  three  tiers  of intermediaries  with
near  monopsony  power  before  reaching
world markets. As a result, the trading mar-
gin from the farm to the factory was 50 per-
cent  and  the  expected  liberalization  price
increases never reached farmers.50

Trade reforms in Mexico show how infra-
structure and transportation costs can shape
opportunities through their impact on price
transmission. Mexico’s trade liberalization in
the  1980s  and  entry  into  North  American
Free  Trade  Agreement  (NAFTA)  in  1994
appear to have led to wage increases in states
bordering the United States relative to the rest
of the country.51 A different study on Mexico
found  that  tariff reductions  translate  into
domestic price reductions less and less as dis-
tance from the main port of entry increases.
This  effect  can  be  substantial  (ﬁgure  9.4).
Studies  of Rwanda  and  Indonesia  have  also
documented  the  isolation  of remote  house-
holds from border price changes.52

Even when trade liberalization is intended
to  be  pro-poor, incomplete  transmission  of

border  price  changes  for  both  exports  and
imports  means  that  beneﬁts  are  not  evenly
distributed. In other words, ease of access to
international  markets  matters. Unfortu-
nately, those  who  could  beneﬁt  most  from
favorable price changes—the poor in remote
rural  areas—are  those  least  likely  to  be
affected by them.

Many of the factors responsible for trans-
mitting trade-related price changes are also
important  to  the  functioning  of domestic
product markets. For instance, competition
among  traders, infrastructure  quality, and
transportation costs all inﬂuence how prof-
its are allocated across a product’s life cycle
or  value  chain. And  the  percentage  of a
good’s  ﬁnal  price  that  goes  to  the  primary
producer, intermediary  producer, distribu-
tor, and retailer can vary tremendously.

The  cashmere  sector  in  Mongolia  shows
how product market reforms could be both
equity- and efﬁciency-enhancing. If properly
developed, cashmere  could  be  a  pillar  of
Mongolia’s successful transition from a com-
mand to a market economy. It is the country’s
single largest employer and a principal source
of livelihood for the poor. It provided jobs for
more  than  16  percent  of the  workforce  and
accounted for more than 6.3 percent of GDP

196

WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2006

during 1993–2002. But unsatisfactory public
sector policies have meant that the industry
has not lived up to its potential.

One signiﬁcant bottleneck is in market-
ing and distribution. Mongolia’s major cash-
mere  market  is  in  Ulaanbataar, 600–1,000
km from most regional production centers.
Herders  generally  have  to  sell  to  traders  at
the farmgate or at informal provincial mar-
ketplaces  at  discounts  of 10  to  45  percent
from  prices  in  Ulaanbataar. With  little
knowledge  of market  demand, individual
herders can incur costs traveling to markets
with  no  certainty  of a  sale. Policies  that
encourage  regional  market  centers  and
herder cooperatives, as well as infrastructure
improvements, could  reduce  marketing
costs and increase herder’s margins.53

Soybean farming in India offers another
illustration  of how  product  marketing
channels  can  improve  equity. Ninety  per-
cent  of the  soybean  crop  is  sold  by  small
farmers  to  traders, who  act  as  purchasing
agents  for  buyers  at  a  local, government-
mandated  marketplace, called  a  mandi.
Farmers  have  only  general  information
about  price  trends  and  no  choice  but  to
accept prices offered to them by traders or
the auction price on the day they bring their
goods to the mandi. As a result, traders can
exploit  farmers  and  buyers  using  practices
that create systemwide inefﬁciencies.

Under the e-Choupal Initiative, ITC, one
of India’s leading private companies, placed
computers  with  Internet  access  in  rural
farming villages. Each computer—placed in
a  farmer’s  home  and  serving  about  10
villages—becomes  a  social  gathering  place
for  the  exchange  of information  and  an 
e-commerce hub. Farmers can use the com-
puters  to  check  prices, learn  about  farming
techniques, purchase  inputs, and  sell  their
soybean  crops  at  the  previous  day’s  market
price. Farmers  then  have  to  transport  their
crop to an ITC processing center, where it is
electronically  weighed  and  the  farmer  is
immediately  paid. Farmers  selling  to  ITC
through  an  e-Choupal  receive, on  average,
2.5  percent  more  for  their  crops, and  ITC
saves an additional 2.5 percent on procure-
ment costs by cutting traders out of the loop.
Farmers also beneﬁt from accurate weighing,

prompt  payment, and  information  about
prices  and  price  trends  that  allows  them  to
optimize 
their  sales  decisions. The  e-
Choupal  system  continues  to  grow  rapidly,
reaching  more  than  3.1  million  farmers  by
late  2004.54 The  initiative  illustrates  how
improvements in technology and communi-
cations infrastructure can be good for both
equity and efﬁciency in product markets.

In addition to better marketing channels
and new technology, there are other ways to
improve  product  market  competition  that
can be good for equity. Measures that facili-
tate the entry of new ﬁrms often mean that
small and medium enterprises beneﬁt at the
expense  of
large, politically  connected
incumbents. Product  market  competition
can  also  drive  consumer  prices  down  and
make  goods  more  affordable  for  the  poor.
Of course, measures  to  improve  competi-
tion  beneﬁt  efﬁciency  and  growth  as  well,
improving the welfare of the poor.

Licensing  restrictions—even  when  de-
signed in the name of equity—are one way
to  hamper  competition. India  reserves  the
production of more than 600 manufactured
products, including  apparel  and  textiles, to
small  companies. This 
licensing  regime
could  cost  the  country  jobs  by  preventing
small producers from growing and compet-
ing with larger manufacturers in, for exam-
ple, China. High  regulatory, administrative,
and  ﬁscal  burdens  can  also  harm  product
markets  by  keeping  ﬁrms  in  the  informal
sector. Informal ﬁrms face a number of con-
straints, including  limited  access  to  ﬁnanc-
ing, which  tend  to  leave  them  signiﬁcantly
less  productive  than  their  formal  sector
counterparts. For example, informal Turkish
brake manufacturers achieve only 22 percent
of U.S. productivity, while their formal sector
competitors  achieve  89  percent. Affordable
access  to  titled  land  and  reliable  infrastruc-
ture  (chapter  8)  can  also  enhance  ﬁrm  and
product market competitiveness.55

As  discussed, improving  transportation
and  logistical  infrastructure  can  reduce  the
cost of moving goods. Better transportation
links  with  other  regions  can  also  provide
insurance against regional price ﬂuctuations.
For  example, if there  is  a  drought  or  food
shortage in one area, efﬁcient regional con-

Markets and the macroeconomy

197

nections  would  allow  consumers  to  import
reasonably  priced  food  from  other  parts  of
the  country. Finally, better  transport  and
logistics  systems  reduce  inventory  costs  by
making the timing of delivery more reliable,
again beneﬁting producers and consumers.56

Interactions between product 
and labor markets
in  product  markets, whether
Changes 
induced by internal developments or exter-
nal trade-related changes, can have power-
ful  inﬂuences  on  the  opportunities  facing
workers. Standard  trade  theory  predicts
that countries should export products that
use  relatively  abundant  factors  intensively.
Labor-abundant  countries  that  open  up
should see relative gains in unskilled wages,
as  indeed  occurred  among  the  East  Asian
tigers in the 1960s and 1970s.57

The Latin American experience stands in
sharp  contrast. Many  countries, including
Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Mex-
ico, and  Uruguay, saw  wider  wage  differen-
tials  with  increasing  trade  openness  during
the late 1980s and 1990s. Some argue that this
was  due  to  the  massive  insertion  of low-
income Asian countries into global markets.
Others  interpret  the  evidence  as  supporting
generalized  skill-biased  technical  change, in
which  trade  opening  facilitated  processes  of
restructuring, including  the  destruction  of
jobs  in  inefﬁcient  industries, and  rising
demand and relative wages for skilled work-
ers.58 Whatever  the  reason, the  question  is
whether this was a source of rising inequality
in  opportunity. Over  the  short  to  medium
term, this  was  almost  certainly  the  case,
because  unskilled  workers  cannot  increase
skills  quickly. Over  the  longer  term, rising
wage  differentials  provide  incentives  for
investment in education, if education systems
provide equal opportunities (chapter 7).

Effects  of economic  restructuring  on
workers also depend on the extent of labor
mobility. One  study  from  India  shows  that
the effects of trade liberalization in the early
1990s on poverty varied by state, depending
on the ﬂexibility of labor laws. In states with
less ﬂexible laws, where liberalization did not
produce any measurable effect on the alloca-
tion  of
labor  across  sectors, the  adverse

impact of trade opening on poverty was felt
the most. In states with more ﬂexible labor
laws, movements  of
labor  across  sectors
eased  the  shock  of relative  price  changes.59
While  greater  mobility  is  desirable,
the
design  of measures  that  increase  ﬂexibility
needs  to  be  balanced  with  the  levels  of
worker  protection  that  are  appropriate  for
the  institutional  setting  (see  the  earlier  dis-
cussion on labor markets).

Safety nets and opportunity
Safety  nets  complement  product  market
deepening  and  are  often  an  essential  ele-
ment  of a  strategy  to  ensure  that  market
expansion  leads  to  more  equal  opportuni-
ties. General  questions  of the  design  of
safety nets were discussed in chapter 7; here
we highlight the links with product market
change. As  discussed  above, trade  opening
creates winners and losers. How this affects
equity depends partly on how governments
can offer support to the losers.

Rodrik  (1998)  ﬁnds  that  openness  is
associated  with  higher  government  spend-
ing. The  argument  is  that  open  economies
are  more  subject  to  external  shocks  and
spend more on social insurance to mitigate
external risk. In more advanced economies
with  the  capacity  to  manage  social  welfare
systems, exposure to external risk is strongly
correlated with spending on social security
and  welfare. In  less-developed  economies,
governments rely on a broader set of tools,
such as public employment, to reduce risk.

The  speciﬁc  design  of safety  nets  can
expand  opportunities  to  those  who  suffer
adverse  effects. For  instance, trade  adjust-
ment  assistance  programs  in  the  United
States  extended  unemployment  beneﬁts,
training, and relocation subsidies to displaced
workers. While the United States was offering
the programs in response to the NAFTA, the
Mexican government established Procampo, a
cash  transfer  program  for  grain  farmers  to
ease the pain of NAFTA-induced competition
from  the  United  States. It  was  designed  to
provide consumption support to compensate
for  price  declines  and  to  allow  farmers  to
diversify into other activities. While the size of
the  transfers  was  hurt  by  the  1995  Tequila
Crisis, there  is  evidence  of gains  to  farmers

and  of the  use  of proceeds  for  investment
purposes.60

While the ideal policy mix may be one that
combines  reduced  barriers  and  extensive
safety nets, in practice, this is not always feasi-
ble. Many  countries  phase  liberalization  to
seek to ensure that processes of job creation
precede or accompany job destruction—this
has  been  a  central  feature  of the  East Asian
experience (see discussion of China in chap-
ter 6). This carries risks of slowing restructur-
ing and extending protection beyond periods
justiﬁed by equity concerns because of cap-
ture by inﬂuential beneﬁciaries.

Credibility, political supportability,
and the design of product 
market reform 
While  technocrats  can  design  trade  and
other  product  market  reforms  that  appear
to  be  good  for  growth  and  equity, the
expected  gains  will  never  materialize  if
there  is  not  enough  political  support.
Because  of the  nature  of trade  policy—a
concentrated set of winners from trade bar-
riers  versus  a  diffuse  set  of winners  from
liberalization (consumers in general)—it is
easy  for  vested  interests  to  capture  policy.
Steel tariffs in the United States and agricul-
tural  subsidies  in  the  United  States, Japan,
and Europe are obvious examples.

Even after trade liberalization laws have
been  passed, they  are  still  not  immune  to
capture. If economic  actors  do  not  believe
that  reforms  are  credible—that  is,
that
politicians will recant at the behest of vested
interests—the  anticipated  adjustments  will
never  take  place. Cashews  in  Mozambique
again provide an apt example. In the early
1990s, the Mozambican government (work-
ing  with  the  World  Bank)  implemented  a
new  pricing  regime  that  liberalized  the
export  of raw  cashews. But  there  was  no
credible  political  commitment  to  the  new
pricing  regime, so  neither  cashew  farmers
nor cashew processors adjusted to the new
price signals. Efﬁciency gains from the real-
location of resources never materialized.61

While this section has emphasized the het-
erogeneity  of effects  of product  market
changes, the policy message is not necessarily
one  of detailed  ﬁne-tuning  of reforms. That

brings  risks  of greater  capture. The  ideal
balance is a combination of gradual but com-
mitted  liberalization  with  extensive  engage-
ment  in  the  complementary  measures  that
broaden  opportunities  for  all: education,
infrastructure, competition, and  safety  nets.
Societal  debate  and  information  can  ensure
that  governments  remain  accountable  to  all
groups, not just those with access and connec-
tions. Of particular  importance  for  external
opening is the role of external commitments.
Entry into international agreements, such as
the  WTO, the  European  Union, or  NAFTA,
can  effectively  lock  politicians  into  trade
reforms. When  trade  regulations  are  bound
by international agreements, reform commit-
ments are more credible and less susceptible
to  capture  by  domestic  special  interests
(asymmetries  in  power  among  the  interna-
tional parties to such agreements remain, as
we will read in chapter 10).

Macroeconomic management
and equity
Macroeconomic instability is both a
cause and consequence of inequity
Macroeconomic stability is a public good and
might be expected to equally affect all. There
is  a  well-established  association  between
macroeconomic  stability  and 
long-term
growth, and growth typically brings expan-
sion  in  opportunities  to  everyone. But  the
fact that stability is a public good does not
mean that the incidence of beneﬁts is equal.
As discussed in chapter 4, the distribution of
income gains from economic growth is typ-
ically as unequal as the initial income distri-
butions. Moreover, macroeconomic  insta-
bility, whether  in  the  form  of volatility  or
high  inﬂation, can  have  differential  and
potentially  inequitable  effects, because  the
pattern  of power  and  wealth  can  inﬂuence
the  distribution  of
losses—and  different
groups  have  differential  capacities  to  man-
age the consequent shocks.

As  in  many  other  areas, there  are  two-
way  patterns  of causation  between  macro-
economic  conditions  and  equity. Unequal
patterns  of power  and  associated  institu-
tional  structures  are  at  the  center  of
causative inﬂuences from inequity to insta-

bility  and  in  regressive  effects  of crises. By
emphasizing these links, we are not arguing
against the large body of literature on eco-
nomic  causes  of crises. Depending  on  the
type of crisis, this literature sees the causes
as ﬁscal imbalances, herdlike movements of
investors  behind  exchange  rate  crises, and
interactions  among  external 
liabilities,
exchange  rates, and  ﬁnancial-corporate
conditions, especially under “crony capital-
ism.”62 Some of the processes in this litera-
ture complement the diagnosis here; others
are  manifestations  of underlying  distribu-
tional and institutional conditions.

Figure  9.5  shows  the  bivariate  correla-
tion between macroeconomic volatility and
a measure of “constraints on the executive”
branch  of government, which  would  be
expected to be closely linked to restraints on
elite  power. Weaker  constraints  are  associ-
ated  with  greater  volatility  (and  a  higher
propensity for macroeconomic crises).

The correlation says nothing about cau-
sation. But there is evidence supporting the
view  that  “weak  and  unequal” institutions
have  a  causative  inﬂuence  on  economic
instability. A  tradition  of work  interprets
instability as a consequence of distributional
struggles  that  are  ineffectively  managed  by
institutions.63 As discussed in chapter 6, the
seminal  work  by  Bates  (1981)  on  Ghana
interprets  exchange  rate  overvaluation  and
internal pricing policies as mechanisms for
governments  to  severely  tax  cocoa  farmers
in  the  early  postindependence  period  to
provide resources to buy off urban groups. A
combination of predatory governments and
weak  or  absent  balancing  institutions  cre-
ated the preconditions for ﬁghts over rents
and systematic political instability until the
early  1980s. Analyses  of hyperinﬂation, in
settings  as  diverse  as  Bolivia  and  Israel,
interpret  macroeconomic  instability  as  a
consequence  of failures  to  manage  societal
conﬂicts.64

Macroeconomic instability can
interact with unequal inﬂuence in
the fallout from crises
Crises, whatever  the  causes, are  systemati-
cally  bad  for  growth, more  so  in  the  pres-
ence  of distributional  struggles. Rodrik

Constraints on the executive index

Source:Authors’ calculations, using World Bank statistics and the
Polity IV database for constraints on the executive index.
Note: A higher value for the constraints on the executive index
denotes greater accountability.

(1999a) argues in a cross-country empirical
analysis that the effects of external shocks in
the 1970s were signiﬁcantly worse for sub-
sequent growth in societies in which latent
distributional conﬂicts (proxied by income
inequality  or  ethnolinguistic  fragmenta-
tion)  were  more  severe  and  conﬂict-
management  mechanisms  (proxied  by
institutional  strength  and  indicators  of
democracy) were weaker.

High 

inﬂation  and  macroeconomic
crises  can  be  particularly  harmful  to  the
poor, who  are  least  equipped  to  manage
adverse shocks. For the impacts on distribu-
tional outcomes, household survey evidence
does not display systematic disequalizing or
equalizing biases across countries: the Mexi-
can  1994–95  crisis  was  slightly  equalizing
(although  strongly  poverty-increasing); the
2001  Argentine  crisis  was  disequalizing.
There is some evidence that high inﬂation is
worse for poorer groups, for example, in the
Philippines65 and Brazil.66

Mechanisms for crisis resolution tend to
be  inequitable  as  a  result  of unequal  inﬂu-
ence. Many  of
the  results  are  not  fully
reﬂected in household income and spending
surveys. The  reason  is  that  the  big  action
usually  takes  place  elsewhere, notably  in
changes  in  capital  income  and  ﬁscal  posi-
tions that the surveys typically fail to capture.

Note: Crisis years are deﬁned as years in which at least two out of three of the following occur: a 25 percent (or
higher) nominal devaluation, negative growth, and 50 percent (or higher) rate of inﬂation. 

There is evidence that crises lead to reduc-
tions in measured labor share (strongly inﬂu-
enced  by 
formal  sector  earnings  and
employment). Diwan  (2001)  ﬁnds  that
labor shares systematically fall during crises
and  don’t  fully  recover  afterward, a  cross-
country  result  illustrated  for  Mexico  and
Peru in ﬁgure 9.6.67 The ﬂip side of this pat-
tern  is  that  the  shares  of corporate  and
ﬁnancial sector capital income rise relative
to wages. There are also signiﬁcant interac-
tions  with  structural  variables. In  particu-
lar, closed trade, capital controls, and ﬁscal
deﬁcits  are  associated  with  higher  labor
shares in normal times, but with larger falls
in labor shares when crises occur. Crises are
mechanisms for the resolution of distribu-
tional conﬂicts that are not tackled during
good  economic  times. Labor  is  relatively
immobile  and  so  typically  bears  a  higher
proportion  of
the  cost. Pre-crisis  labor
shares  may, in  some  cases, have  been  too
high  for  competitiveness  and  stability, but
the point is that crises are a high-cost form
of conﬂict  resolution. And  the  interaction
between  shocks  and  weak  conﬂict  resolu-
tion mechanisms is associated with weaker
long-run growth.68

In  addition  to  any  effects  through  the
distribution  of labor  and  capital  income,
important  mechanisms  work  through  the
ﬁnancial sector and associated ﬁscal action.

Note: Costs refer to both ﬁscal and quasi-ﬁscal
outlays and the present value of the future
stream of costs. Banking crises in Ecuador,
Mexico, the Republic of Korea, and Indonesia
were ongoing at the time of the study.

Major  crises  lead  to  large  ﬁnancial  losses,
typically  ﬁnanced  by  both  explicit  and
implicit  ﬁscal  outlays. Case  study  evidence
indicates  that  these  are  highly  regressive,
through  gainers  and  losers  from  capital
ﬂights,
transfers  from  those  outside  to
within  the  ﬁnancial  system, and  the  pat-
terns of bailout among ﬁnancial sector par-
ticipants.

The ﬁscal costs of crises are large (table
9.3). For  example, the  post–Tequila  Crisis
Mexican  bailout  is  estimated  at  $112  bil-
lion, with  a  large  additional  amount  spent
trying  to  prevent  crises  through  liquidity
support, sovereign  bond  swaps, and  the
ﬁnancing  of large  investors  who  withdraw
money from projects.69 Halac and Schmuk-
ler (2003) use the $23 billion decline in the
central  bank’s  reserves  between  February
and December 1994 as a proxy, calculating a
total ﬁscal and quasi-ﬁscal cost of the crisis
of $135 billion. This represents about one-
quarter of Mexico’s GDP in 2000 and some
four times the $33 billion in capital receipts
from privatization during the 1990s.

What is the pattern of gainers and losers?
Some  wealthy  individuals  undoubtedly  lose
their  shirts. But  there  are  strong  tendencies
for the poor to lose, sometimes to lose a lot.
First, the  wealthy  with  information  and
access  to  international  banking  systems  get
their money out ﬁrst. And they may actually
experience capital gains when domestic asset
prices  tumble  and  the  exchange  rate  goes
against the currency. In Argentina, the ratio
of foreign assets to domestic GDP rose from
about  a  quarter  to  more  than  90  percent
between  2001  and  early  2002, because  of a
combination  of capital  ﬂight  and  currency
depreciation (ﬁgure 9.7).

Second, the  recipients  of ﬁscal  bailouts
are  those  within  the  ﬁnancial  system—
depositors, creditors, and  equity  owners,
who are systematically better off than those
outside. (There are of course small middle-
income depositors but, as noted below, it is
possible to protect them without providing
blanket protection for all.) Case study evi-
dence ﬁnds biases toward wealthy and more
inﬂuential  individuals  and  groups  within
ﬁnancial systems. Owners of large deposits
enjoyed  the  greatest  compensation  (and

in  crises 

sometimes  capital  gains) 
in
Argentina, Ecuador, and  Uruguay, often
through  getting  their  money  out  of the
country, while  small  depositors  suffered
capital losses. In addition, there is evidence
that large borrowers with close connections
to banks were especially favored in crises in
Chile, Ecuador, and Mexico.70

Crisis costs are paid for by some combi-
nation of higher taxes and lower spending.
Who pays depends on the marginal pattern
of taxation and spending. As a ﬁrst approxi-
mation  on  the  tax  side, many  developing-
country  tax  systems  are  roughly  propor-
tional (everyone pays the same proportion
of their income, primarily through indirect
taxation). On  the  spending  side, work  on
Latin America  and Asia  in  the  1990s  ﬁnds
that  marginal  spending  was  generally  pro-
gressive, as  the  expansion  of social  and
infrastructure  programs  “crowded 
in”
poorer  groups.71 Thus, the  forgone  spend-
ing  hurt  poorer  groups  the  most. The  net
effect  is  a  regressive  workout  ﬁnanced
largely by regressive ﬁscal adjustment.

While  case  study  evidence  indicates  a
strong pattern of regressive consequences of

crises, this  is  contingent  on  initial  struc-
tures, patterns  of
inﬂuence, and  policy
speciﬁcs. For  example, the  Russian  crisis,
while  undoubtedly  costly  in  social  terms,
may have led to a surprisingly positive shift
to  more  equitable  structures  of resource
management (box 9.6).

Policy directions need to take account
of policy design and accountability
structures
Macroeconomic  instability  is  thus  both
product  and  cause  of underlying  inequali-
ties  and  associated  weak  institutions. The
costs are large to equity and growth. What
can  be  done? As  in  other  areas, it  helps  to
answer  this  question  in  terms  of the  com-

B O X   9 . 6 Did the Russian 1998 crisis have equitable

consequences?

The Russian crisis was at ﬁrst glance typical of
crises of the 1990s—driven by interactions
between private capital movements and
domestic institutional structures that encour-
aged moral hazard,and with large adverse
effects for welfare.The social costs were
severe,with a fall in GDP of 5 percent in 1998.
Between 1996 and 1998 household per capita
expenditures fell 25 percent,expenditure
poverty rose from 22 to 33 percent and gov-
ernment transfers fell by 18 percent,albeit
with better targeting (Lokshin and Ravallion
2000).There was also major capital ﬂight,with
many of the rich getting their assets out fast,
leaving the rest of the society to share the
costs.This fact alone is a sign of great inequity:
the rich had more opportunity to protect their
assets by shifting money out of the country.
This (individually rational) behavior imposed
costs on less wealthy groups.

But the transition appears to have had

additional effects that were, at least to some
degree, more equitable. Russia before the
crisis was in a particularly inefﬁcient and
inequitable equilibrium, in which ﬁrms did
not pay their energy or tax bills, and the
energy sector didn’t pay its taxes. Firms
were not allowed to go under for fear of
employment effects, but this was a highly
ineffective safety net. Subsidies were esti-
mated at 15 to 20 percent of GDP in the
three years before the crisis, fueling corrup-
tion and delaying enterprise restructuring.
There was extensive asset-stripping at the
cost of the broader society.

The crisis triggered major changes in

economic relationships.The strategy of
“devalue and default” led to large relative
price movements and cut Russia off from
international capital markets.The cutoff,
combined with the authorities’ recognition
of the unpopularity of hyperinﬂation, ﬁnally
forced hard budget constraints on the sys-
tem, which had powerful ripple effects in
inducing the demise of the nonpayments
system, making economic transactions
more transparent and laying the basis for a
recovery in taxes. Real exchange rate depre-
ciation made many ﬁrms competitive again,
and this fed through into employment. Fur-
thermore, the big Moscow banks were
allowed to fail (with total costs, largely
incurred before the meltdown, a relatively
low 2 percent of GDP). And the default
meant that external holders of Russian
paper took an immediate loss, effectively
allowing a degree of international burden-
sharing.While there were undoubtedly rep-
utational costs, there may have been an
advantage in taking this upfront, rather
than after protracted negotiations. Overall,
while a serious analysis of impacts on equal-
ity of opportunity is not feasible, the effec-
tive shift in regime from a system in which
inﬂuence played a dominant role in
resource allocation to one of hard budget
constraints and greater transparency was
probably good for efﬁciency and equity.

plementary  role  of speciﬁc  policy  design
and the deepening of accountability struc-
tures  and  societal  mechanisms  to  manage
conﬂict. The Israeli hyperinﬂation provides
an illustration. Its resolution involved both
a  full  set  of ﬁnancial  and  macroeconomic
policies and an intensive process of societal
interaction to manage underlying conﬂicts
between organized labor, the corporate sec-
tor, and other interest groups.72

There  is  an  extensive  body  of literature
on design speciﬁcs. Thus, we conclude with
some comments on the principles of macro-
economic management that emerge from a
focus on equity. Some of the principles are
fairly  familiar, especially  the  need  to  build
stronger  regulatory  and  supervisory  struc-
tures  for  the  ﬁnancial  system  and  compre-
hensive insurance mechanisms while out of
crisis. Once a crisis hits, it is particularly dif-
ﬁcult to design and implement such meas-
ures  and  politically  difﬁcult  to  implement
more  equitable  outcomes. By  contrast  ex
ante insurance design—whether for deposi-
tors, bankruptcy, or  unemployment—is
more likely to be broad based and, if already
in place, reduces the case for ex post deals
tailored to the inﬂuential.

Less  obvious  is  a  heightened  emphasis
on  fiscal  prudence. In  public  debates,
adopting  a  less  stringent  macroeconomic
stance is often portrayed as a distribution-
ally progressive approach, whether in good
times  or  bad. While  there  will  always  be
specific  judgments  about  the  distribu-
tional  impacts  of a  range  of fiscal  and
monetary policy options, the analysis here
suggests that taking a “superprudent” posi-
tion  over  the  course  of the  cycle  provides
greater hope for supporting a more equal
development  pattern. On  one  level, this
sharply  reinforces  the  common  prescrip-
tion  to  break  procyclical  policy  positions.
Macroeconomic  restraint  in  good  times
will  facilitate  automatic  stabilizers  and  a
sensible easing of policies to be applied in
a disciplined fashion when adverse shocks
occur. Thus, the  priority  is  to  build  fiscal
rules  and  institutions  that  help  overcome
the political pressures to deplete potential
surpluses  in  good  times, as  well  as  infor-
mational asymmetry problems. These insi-

tutions should also improve the credibility
of countercyclical  fiscal  policies  during
downturns.73 This strategy would, in par-
ticular, provide the macroeconomic foun-
dation  for  broad-based,
self-expanding
safety nets.

Finally, there is a case for different forms
of accountability. Over  the  long  term, the
most effective approach is to move to new
ﬁscal  and  social  contracts  built  on  deeper
accountability structures—to a better polit-
ical equilibrium.74 There is then a need for
an  appropriate  mix  of stronger  regulatory
accountability  shielded 
from  short-run
political  pressures  from  all  sides—more
independent  central  banks  and  stronger
ﬁnancial  sector  supervision—and  greater
transparency  and  debate  about  the  overall
design of macropolicy and the incidence of
workouts. There are important interactions
with  external  actors  and  rules  for  crisis
management that will be taken up in chap-
ter 10.

In sum, we have explored policies that,
by leveling the playing ﬁeld in the markets
for capital, labor, and goods and by manag-
ing the macroeconomy, can lead to greater
equity  and  prosperity. Financial  markets
are  typically  biased  toward  incumbents,
reﬂecting  the  historical  political  inﬂuence
of the powerful. Yet rapid and ill-designed
liberalizations  can  lead  to  further  concen-
tration  of inﬂuence. Greater  societal  con-
trols are needed as well as a more measured
tackling  of barriers—especially  to  small
and  medium  ﬁrms—backed  by  regulatory
structures and more information to reduce
the power of connections.

Labor  market  outcomes  may  reﬂect  the
weak  bargaining  position  of workers, but
labor  policies  often  lead  to  patterns  of job
protection  that  create  economic  rigidities
and  help  those  in  good  jobs, to  the  detri-
ment  of those  in  the  informal  economy.
Support for unions and security for workers
are  important  objectives, but  designs  need
to  be  adapted  to  economic  conditions  in
ways  that  reach  poorer, informal  workers
and  minimize  impediments  to  economic
restructuring.

Both the design of external trade policy
and the workings of internal product mar-

Markets and the macroeconomy

kets  reflect  patterns  of influence. Remov-
ing  biases  and  ensuring  access  to  all  need
to be complemented by measures to expand
skills,
infrastructure, and  safety  nets  to
achieve genuine access and to manage losses
(especially  horizontal  inequities). Impru-
dent  macroeconomic  policy  is  typically
inequitable: high inﬂation hurts those least
capable of managing its consequences, and

ﬁnancial crises are particularly pernicious,
because  the  powerful  can  beneﬁt  or  be
bailed out at the expense of the rest of soci-
ety. Prudent macroeconomic management,
backed by strong countercyclical policy and
independence  in  policy  design  is  an  ally,
not a foe, of greater equity. We now turn to
policies that can help level the global play-
ing ﬁeld.

regional inequality

The role of public policy in addressing spatial inequalities
The persistence of regional disparities within countries is a major policy concern confronting many governments in rich
and poor countries alike. Clarity on the causal factors of weak regional performance and careful consideration of
potential tradeoffs are needed to guide policy choice over regional interventions.

The average income in Brazil’s north-

east  is  less  than  half the  national
average. Poverty  rates  are  far  higher
than  the  national  average  in  India’s  densely
populated states of Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, and
Orissa, and the regional income gap appears
to  be  widening. In  1990, children  in  the
northwest region of Nigeria were four times
less likely to receive any immunizations and
50 percent more likely to die by age ﬁve than
those  near  the  capital  in  the  southwest; by
1999 they were ﬁve times less likely to receive
any  immunizations  and  85  percent  more
likely to die before age ﬁve. Chronic regional
underperformance  can  give  rise  to  many
concerns  and  threaten  national  unity—lost
economic  potential, unfairness  in  regional
opportunities, potential  instability,
loss  of
social  cohesion, and  adverse  social  conse-
quences, including higher crime and disease.
The  geographic  and  historical  factors
underlying 
inequality  are
complex  and  overlapping. Weak  resource
endowments  and  distance  from  markets
can  constrain  development 
lagging
regions. In  many  cases, economic  differ-
ences  are 
long-standing,
unequal relations of power between advan-
taged and lagging regions, and institutional
weaknesses within the latter.1 When actors
in  advantaged  regions  control  the  assets,

processes, and  the  terms  of
the  policy
debates  on  which  lagging  regions  depend,
regional “catch up” is much more difﬁcult.2
When historically disadvantaged ethnic,
racial, and social groups are concentrated in
particular  regions, group-based  inequities
become  reﬂected  in  regional  inequalities.
This  is  the  case  in  parts  of Latin America,
where  indigenous  groups  are  both  poorer
and concentrated in poorer regions,3 and in
Vietnam  and  in  India  where  tribal  groups
(adivasis) are spatially concentrated.4

linked  with 

In  the  absence  of redistributive  ﬁscal
transfers, recent  reforms  in  many  countries
toward  greater  decentralization  may  aggra-
vate regional disparities. The positive effects
of decentralization  may  be  lost  in  regions

that  have  weaker  ﬁscal  capacity, such  as  in
Argentina’s  experience  with  decentralizing
reforms in education.5 In poor regions where
regional elites have particularly concentrated
power, decentralization  may  also  deepen
both intra- and inter-regional inequalities.6

Trends  in  inter-regional  inequality  have
varied  considerably  across  countries. The
United  States  has  experienced  convergence
and  lower  interregional  income  disparities.
Indonesia  shows  convergence  of provincial
incomes  since  the  1970s. Brazil  has  seen
divergence  over  many  decades, but  recently
has  shown  convergence. Evidence  on  India
also  suggests  divergence. China’s  pattern  of
growth  has  reduced  gaps  in  the  1970s  and
1980s, which  widened  in  the  1990s. And  in
Mexico a long-run trend of slow convergence
in incomes shifted to one of slow divergence
after an opening that started in the late 1980s.

Characteristics of lagging regions
The reasons for regions to lag varies, and we
present a simple taxonomy.

Low  poverty  density, low  market  access.
These  regions  are  sparsely  populated,
remote, and face particular geographic chal-
lenges. Distance and poor resource endow-
ment—often  with  weak  social  indicators,
generally  poor  infrastructure, and  weak
regional  voice—place  these  regions  at  the
periphery of national economic activity and
opportunity. Supporting  development  of
these  regions  may  be  desirable  on  poverty
grounds, but it is likely to be expensive.

Low  poverty  density, high  market  access.
These regions typically have been booming
at one point in history, and were well inte-

grated  with  the  national  economy. But
changing  demand  patterns  or  resource
exhaustion became sources of decline, even
though  political  inﬂuence  may  have  per-
sisted. For such “rustbelt” regions, there is a
case  for  public  support  for  movement  of
people  and  resources  out  of declining
industries, backed  by  social  safety  nets  for
the affected workforce.

High poverty density, high or low market
access. These regions are most often consid-
ered  for  targeted  interventions: poverty  is
concentrated in them, population density is
relatively high, and the lack of market inte-
gration is due to history rather than geogra-
phy. Possible  culprits  include  weak  gover-
nance, poor 
institutional  capacity  and
human  capital, a  history  of sociocultural
conﬂict and domination, a poor investment
climate,
and  security  problems. Such
regions are often home to socially, racially,
and 
ethnically  disadvantaged  groups.
Where such groups are dispersed or patron-
client relationships dominate, the challenge
of fostering organization, agency, and polit-
ical inﬂuence is especially great.7

Regional development policies
and tradeoffs
Regional  development  policies 
involve
interventions  to  facilitate  inward  invest-
ment, enhance  income  opportunities  and
well-being  in  lagging  regions, help  house-
holds move to opportunities elsewhere, and
shift interregional power relations. Policies
are context speciﬁc and involve tradeoffs. If
lagging  regional  performance  reﬂects  geo-
graphic  disadvantages  or  an  absence  of

agglomeration and scale economies, public
interventions  may  be  particularly  expen-
sive. But when public policy is designed to
correct  market  failures  (such  as  underde-
veloped 
insurance  or  credit  markets),
address  speciﬁc  social  or  historical  factors
handicapping  regional  performance, or
capture  externalities  intrinsic  to  national
welfare (cultural, environmental, security),
there may be few or no efﬁciency tradeoffs.

Fiscal incentives
A  popular  approach  involves  ﬁscal  incen-
tives to induce industry to locate and invest
in lagging regions: tax advantages, insurance
or  risk-sharing  arrangements, direct  subsi-
dies, or indirect subsidies through provision
of low-cost public services. But evaluations
of ﬁscal  incentives  generally  indicate  that
they  can  be  costly  and  ineffective. Brazil’s
efforts to develop the manufacturing center
of Manaus in the north have been a success
by some measures, but costs per job created
are high.8 Interregional “ﬁscal wars” can also
occur  as  regions  compete  to  attract  busi-
nesses. If uncoordinated  or  unconstrained,
these  can  have  adverse  consequences  for
local tax bases and public services in com-
peting jurisdictions. Compared to the alter-
natives listed below, this tends to be a high-
distortion strategy.

infrastructure,

Public investment
Targeted public investment, particularly in
core 
is  another  policy
response aimed at reducing geographic dis-
incentives  to  ﬁrm  location, whether  for
existing  or  new  ﬁrms. China  has  followed
this strategy, ﬁrst in the coastal special eco-
nomic  zones, and  now  in  western  regions
(see box below).

Investment  in  regional  infrastructure
links may enhance productivity of existing
ﬁrms  and  attract  new  ﬁrms. But, it  also
allows more efﬁcient ﬁrms in richer regions

to sell to lagging regions. This is one factor
that  has  slowed  development  of the  rela-
tively poor Mezzogiorno region of southern
Italy, despite  large  investments  in  national
north-south infrastructure that has reduced
transport costs.9

Facilitating labor mobility 
Facilitating  voluntary  labor  movement  to
higher  opportunity  areas  is  another  strat-
egy. In contrast to ﬁscal incentives and pub-
lic investments that focus on bringing jobs
to  poor  areas, this  strategy  focuses  on
bringing  poor  people  to  areas  with  more
potential. Relocation assistance can include
transport, housing, training, resettlement
allowances, and portable safety nets. Exam-
ples included incentives in Russia for fami-
lies  to  relocate  from  their  northern  settle-
ments—developed at huge state expense for
resource  extraction  and  security  purposes
during  the  Cold  War—and  incentives  to
support movement of labor out of declin-
ing  industries, such  as  the  moribund  coal
sectors  in Western  Europe  and  the  former
Soviet  Union  since  the  1960s. While  the
programs  have  helped  ease  the  impact  of
unemployment, there  are  questions  about
cost effectiveness and long-term impact.

There is also a long history of efforts to
direct  settlement  of remote  regions  or
encourage  migration  to  frontier 
lands.
Early settlers to the Americas, including the
west and midwestern regions of the United
States, were  beneﬁciaries  of
legal  land
grants  to  clear  and  use  new  land. More
recent programs include Indonesia’s trans-
migration program that shifted Javanese to
sparsely  populated  outer  islands  in  the
1970s  and  1980s, or  early  Ethiopian  reset-
tlement  programs  to  fertile  areas  in  the
south and southwest regions of the country.
However, these and other resettlement pro-
grams have been criticized for their coercive
or  ethnic  dimensions, raising  questions

about  the  adverse  impact  on  indigenous
population groups and settlers.

Enhancing agency
Where  intergroup  inequalities  in  agency
underlie  regional  disadvantage, national
and  regional  policies  addressing  discrimi-
nation, racism, and citizenship deﬁcits can
be important instruments for dealing with
spatial inequality. Enhancing voice and par-
ticipation of excluded groups is also impor-
tant for national peace and cohesion. While
ethnic  discrimination  and  regional  disad-
vantage do not necessarily lead to conﬂict,
researchers  and  truth  and  reconciliation
commissions  alike  have  identiﬁed  them  as
contributing  factors.10 In  Aceh, Indonesia,
oil rents have been transferred back to the
region since 1976, yet regional conﬂict and
demands  for  autonomy  have  increased
rather  than  abated.11 This  suggests  that
transfers alone are not sufﬁcient to address
regionally  concentrated  grievances—they
must be accompanied by meaningful politi-
cal participation and dialogue.

Conclusion
The  speciﬁc  nature  of the  constraints  to
regional  growth  and  investment  perform-
ance in lagging regions needs to be identi-
ﬁed  and  prioritized. Policies  that  provide
ﬁscal incentives to investors are likely to fail
if the main factors that adversely inﬂuence
regional  investment  climate—quality  of
local  institutions, skilled  labor  availability,
proximity to key markets, functioning capi-
tal  and  land  markets, security  risks—still
pose binding constraints.

Public  investment  in  infrastructure  that
reduces transport costs for both people and
goods has often proved an effective strategy
for integration. And, as with other policies,
well  designed  technical  solutions  are  more
likely  to  be  implemented  if those  living  in
poorer regions are empowered.

Unprecedented economic growth and poverty
reduction in China have been accompanied by
signiﬁcant increases in regional disparities since
the economic reform in the late 1970s.The
socioeconomic costs of a sustained divergence
in income between leading and lagging regions
has become a major concern of the government.
In 1999, the government initiated the “Go
West” strategy to develop the lagging western
region. Through targeted public investments
and fiscal subsidies, the central government

spent some 1,000 billion yuan (US$120
billion) in the past five years, focusing on
infrastructure, education, health, and the envi-
ronment. A variety of investment incentives
and low interest loans aimed to attract
domestic and foreign firms to areas in which
the western region has some comparative
advantage, such as energy, agriculture, and
agroprocessing.

The relative decline of the historically
advantaged northeastern region has also

attracted concern. China’s northeast currently
suffers from slow growth and high unemploy-
ment in declining industries, along with many
severely distressed towns and cities.The govern-
ment started the “Revitalize Northeast” strategy
in 2003.This involves new initiatives, including
strengthening the investment climate, develop-
ing greater ﬂexibility in factor markets, using
public funds to support rather than postpone
adjustment, and mitigating social costs through
improved and portable safety nets.

Achieving greater global equity

10c h a p t e r

206

We  read  in  chapter  2  that  there  are  huge
inequities in the world. Even better-off citi-
zens  in  most  of the  developing  world  face
worse  opportunities  than  the  poor  in  rich
countries. The fact that country of birth is a
key  determinant  of people’s  opportunities
runs counter to our view of equity—that is,
that people should enjoy the same opportu-
nities  regardless  of
their  background,
including where they are born.

Greater  global  equity  is  desirable  for
itself to  all  those  who  ﬁnd  equity  intrinsi-
cally  valuable. The  international  human
rights  regime  testiﬁes  to  the  shared  belief
that  all  should  have  equal  rights  and  be
spared  extreme  deprivation. Some  even
argue that there is a powerful moral case for
rich countries to take action, because of the
huge  disparities  and  (arguably)  because
they  partly  created  and  perpetuate  global
inequities.1 Greater  equity  is  also  desirable
because  it  would  likely  be  beneﬁcial  to
global  prosperity  in  the  long  run. Greater
equity in access to health and health reme-
dies, especially  for  transmittable  diseases,
would reduce global health inequalities and
be  beneﬁcial  to  poor  and  rich  countries
alike. Greater equity in access to and control
over natural resources and the global com-
mons  may  lead  to  more  sustainable  use.
Some  argue  that  greater  equity  could  also
lead to greater international stability: fragile
and  failed  states  pose  a  threat  to  local  and
global stability.2

What  can  be  done  to  reduce  the  huge
inequities we experience today? The debate
about  what  causes  global  inequities  and
how to address them is highly contentious.
Some  see  globalization—greater  global
integration—as  a  source  of equalization,
others  a  source  of widening  inequalities,
with  richer  countries  and  corporations

making rules that beneﬁt themselves at the
cost of the weak, poor, and voiceless. There
is some truth on all sides of the debate. In
terms of trends, we saw in chapter 2 that the
picture is mixed: convergence in health and
(probably)  education  for  many, conver-
gence in incomes for some, but divergence
in incomes and health for others. In terms
of causes, just as some of the major sources
of convergence  have  been  associated  with
globalization  of markets  and  knowledge—
the  East Asian  tigers, China, India  making
use  of global  markets, the  spread  of the
green  revolution  and  health-related  tech-
nology—so  unequal  rules  and  unequal
inﬂuence profoundly shape opportunity.

Domestic  action  is  clearly  central  to
reducing  inequities. Developing  countries
hold  the  keys  to  their  prosperity; global
action  cannot  substitute  for  equitable  and
efﬁcient  domestic  policies  and  institutions.
But  global  conditions  powerfully  affect  the
scope  for  and  impact  of domestic  policies.
Global  action—by  governments, people,
and  organizations  in  developed  countries
and by international institutions—can deter-
mine  whether  the  globalization  process
brings about greater equity, peace, and pros-
perity, or  fuels  tensions  and  conﬂicts  that
will lead to backlash and violence.

Current disparities are products of inter-
actions between two factors: the endowments
of different countries, and the rules shaping
the options for deploying these endowments
on  domestic  and  global  markets. Endow-
ments are greatly unequal due to history and
geography—although  some  of the  history
and  aspects  of geography  are  a  product  of
unequal  development  patterns. Infrastruc-
ture underdevelopment in Africa, for exam-
ple, is partly a legacy of colonial political and
economic patterns. Institutional weaknesses

Achieving greater global equity

207

of poorer  societies—now  part  of
their
endowment—also  reﬂect  historical  pat-
terns, as discussed in chapter 6. Differences
in endowments are often exacerbated by the
inequitable  functioning  of markets. As  in
the  domestic  realm, market  imperfections
can be either a product of policy (as in bar-
riers to labor mobility or agricultural pro-
tection) or of intrinsic market failures (as in
weak  protection  of global  commons  and
lack of incentives for knowledge creation).
Achieving  greater  global  equity  thus
requires  global  policies 
improve
endowments and address market imperfec-
tions and more representative global insitu-
tions. We ﬁrst discuss the global markets for
labor, goods, ideas, and  capital—all  func-
tioning within the context of international
law  (box  10.1). For  each  market, we  high-
light  existing  inequities  and  their  impact,
discuss  the  processes  that  lead  to  such
inequities, and  explore  some  options  for
change. We next turn to rectifying past and

that 

response 

to 

traditional 

present  inequities  in  the  use  of natural
resources. Then  we  look  at  whether  aid—
the 
global
inequity—can be used effectively to acceler-
ate  domestic  efforts  to  build  endowments.
The current state of international relations
may  cause  some  to  wonder  whether  any
change is possible. So we close the chapter
by  examining  factors  that  have  facilitated
transitions  to  more  equitable  policies  and
institutions  in  the  past. We  conclude  that
change may be difﬁcult but not impossible.3

Making global markets work
more equitably
Global  markets  have  many  faces: Filipino
nurses, Sri Lankan domestic workers, Polish
care  providers, Indian  engineers, Ugandan
coffee growers, Bangladeshi women working
in  garment  factories, Moroccan  craftsmen,
employers of migrants, and the consumers of
developing-country  products  in  Australia,

B O X   1 0 . 1 International law, globalization, and equity

Globalization takes place (mostly) in the context
of international law, which governs relations
among states, and other international legal sub-
jects, such as international organizations. More
equitable development, application, monitoring,
and enforcement of international law is essen-
tial to make globalization more equitable.

The meaning of equity in international law. Equity
considerations inform the development of interna-
tional law,conﬁrming that greater global equity is a
shared value.The principle of equity has accompa-
nied the development of international law over the
centuries (chapter 4).Equity in international law
encompasses notions of corrective justice and dis-
tributive justice—that the strict application of the
law should be tempered by considerations of
equity or fairness to achieve a just result,and that
international law should promote a more even dis-
tribution of resources among states.Equitable prin-
ciples have been applied to many areas of interna-
tional law,from the sharing of scientiﬁc beneﬁts,
technology,and natural resources to laws govern-
ing the sea,international waterways,outer space,
and carbon emissions.As highlighted in chapter 4,
the most pertinent example of the application of
principles of equity in international law is the inter-
national human rights regime.In today’s
international law,equity has not only an interstate
dimension;it also has an intergenerational dimen-
sion,in the preservation of the environment and
other global commons,as we will see below.

Rule-setting processes. International laws are
formed through complex negotiating processes.
The degree to which these processes are
perceived to be equitable affects their adoption
and implementation—so processes matter
greatly. Generally, a state remains free to decide
whether to become a party to a convention or
covenant. And a state’s satisfaction with the
process leading to the adoption of a convention
may facilitate signing and subsequent adoption.
For example, the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights, seen by many as the basis of sub-
sequent human rights instruments, was
adopted by the U.N. General Assembly, where all
countries are represented and have one vote.
While only a declaration, and not intended to
bind states at the time it was adopted, the
process leading to its adoption was perceived to
be equitable.The body of standards set by the
ILO is another example of rules set through an
international process that is broadly consulta-
tive, encompassing not just governments but
unions and private sector representatives. On
the other hand, the rule-setting processes of the
World Trade Organization (and its predecessor,
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) are
perceived by some as inequitable, and this is
partly responsible for the current stalemate.

Application and enforcement mechanisms.

The processes that interpret, apply, and enforce
international laws are crucial to realizing

greater equity. In general, the ability of states
to pursue and enforce rights under
international law depends on appropriate
adjudication processes or complaint
mechanisms and their effectiveness. A number
of international courts and other adjudicative
bodies often have voluntary jurisdiction, but
there is a trend toward judicialization and com-
pulsory jurisdiction. For example, dispute set-
tlement arrangements established under the
1982 U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea
and the 1994 World Trade Organization
Dispute Settlement Understanding mark a sig-
nificant move toward compulsory jurisdiction
and binding decision making.

The ability of citizens and other nonstate
actors to pursue their rights and seek redress
under international law depends on whether
their state has become a party to the
instruments that allow the use of compliance
mechanism. For example, for citizens to make a
complaint against their state under the Interna-
tional Covenant of Civil and Political Rights, the
state must have signed and ratiﬁed the First
Optional Protocol, which allows a complaint to
be heard by the Human Rights Committee
established by the covenant. As the discussion
indicates and in parallel to what happens on the
domestic arena, rules often block access, even
before expenses, knowledge, and capacity limit
effective recourse.

the  European  countries, Japan, the  United
States, and the richer middle-income coun-
tries. Global  markets  create  valuable  eco-
nomic opportunities for millions of people,
who develop ideas, raise capital, and sell their
products and their labor.

But  unequal  endowments  and  unfair
processes mean that opportunities and rules
are  not  the  same  for  all. Inequities  exist  in
the functioning of these markets. Unskilled
workers  from  poor  countries, who  could
earn  higher  returns  in  rich  countries, face
great  hurdles  in  migrating. Developing-
country  producers  face  obstacles  in  selling
agricultural  products, manufactured  items,
and services in developed countries. Foreign
investors often get better deals in debt crises.
In  most  cases, more  equitable  rules
would bring beneﬁts to both developed and
developing countries, but the extent of ben-
eﬁts varies by market. Barriers are massively
greater in the market for labor—the factor
of production that the poor own in relative
abundance—than in the markets for goods
and  capital, and  factor  price  equalization
clearly does not work through trade alone.
So  removing  barriers  to  migration  could
have  a  signiﬁcant  impact  on  expanding

people’s  opportunities  (of course, migra-
tion  raises  complex  issues  that  are  politi-
cally  and  socially  difficult  to  tackle  in
sending and receiving countries).

Beneﬁts  also  vary  greatly  depending  on
country context. The fast-growing develop-
ing  countries, including  China  and  India
that  are  home  to  half the  world’s  poorest
people, stand  to  beneﬁt  signiﬁcantly  from
more equitable global markets. Leveling the
global  playing  ﬁeld  can  help  them  sustain
fast growth, while equitable domestic poli-
cies help ensure that this growth is shared.
Countries with more limited endowments,
such as many African countries, that are left
behind in the global economy, stand to ben-
eﬁt  less  in  the  short  to  medium  run  from
more equitable global markets.

Greater international labor mobility
Returns  to  capital, and  to  some  extent
skilled  labor, tend  to  equalize  across  coun-
tries, but returns to unskilled labor, owned
by  poor  people  and  in  abundant  supply  in
poor  countries, generally  do  not  converge.
Wage  differentials  across  countries  for  jobs
requiring  similar  skills  are  large, and  sub-
stantially larger than the wage gap between
the  United  States  and  migrant-sending
countries in the late nineteenth century (ﬁg-
ure 10.1). Developed countries severely limit
in-migration  of unskilled  and  semi-skilled
workers, which  contributes  to  the  lack  of
equalization in returns to unskilled labor.

Greater  migration  of unskilled  labor
would  tend  to  equalize  returns, with  win-
ners and losers, but with potentially beneﬁ-
cial effects on efﬁciency. History teaches us
that migration has, at various times, allevi-
ated  human  suffering  and  promoted  cul-
tural and technological exchanges. The mass
migration  from  Europe  to  the Americas  in
the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries
enabled 60 million people to escape poverty
and  persecution, creating  some  of today’s
wealthiest societies (although Native Ameri-
cans faced enormous losses in the process).4
Economic  analyses  indicate  that  gains
from  expanding  migration  could  be  very
signiﬁcant. Hamilton  and  Whalley  (1984)
use a highly simpliﬁed economic model of
the world to suggest that the beneﬁts from
reallocation of labor could be huge (on the

Achieving greater global equity

209

order  of doubling  GDP). This, of course,
depends  on  the  speciﬁc  assumptions  used
and ignores a host of adjustment issues, but
it  does  serve  to  illustrate  that  the  gains
could  be  large  and  probably  much  larger
than  the  gains  from  the, by  comparison,
already  greatly  liberalized  trade  in  goods.
Indeed, using  an  approach  similar  to  that 
of analyses  of
trade  impacts, Walmsley 
and Winters (2003) estimated that increas-
ing  temporary  migration  into  industrial
countries  by  3  percent  of host  countries’
current skilled and unskilled work force—
equivalent to permitting an extra 8 million
skilled and 8.4 million unskilled workers to
be  employed  at  any  time, roughly  a  dou-
bling  of current  net  migration  into  high-
income countries—would generate an esti-
mated  increase  in  world  welfare  of more
than  $150  billion  a  year. This  increase
would  be  shared  fairly  equally  between
developing-  and  developed-country  citi-
zens. Much  of the  gain  would  come  from
the migration of unskilled workers. Coun-
try  studies  conﬁrm  that  migration  could
have a signiﬁcant impact. Annabi and oth-
ers  (forthcoming)  found  that  a  50  percent
increase  in  the  ﬂow  of remittances  to
Bangladesh  would  reduce  the  incidence  of
$1 per day income poverty by 0.8 percent in
the short run and by 4 percent by 2020.5

Doesn’t migration raise income inequal-
ity  in  sending  countries?  As  a  high-risk,
high-return  activity, migration  is  more
likely to be undertaken ﬁrst by members of
wealthier,
less  credit-constrained, better-
educated  households. Successful  migrants
later provide information and assistance to
potential migrants through social networks,
thus lowering risks and costs and making it
possible  for  members  of households  in
lower  parts  of the  income  distribution  to
migrate.6 In the ﬁrst stages of the migration
process,
to  wealthier
households  can  increase  inequality, if they
are higher than forgone income.7 As migra-
tion expands, remittances begin to arrive to
less well-off households and income distri-
bution  improves.8 Remittances  also  have
indirect  effects  through  greater  spending,
risk  diversiﬁcation, and  easing  of credit
constraints, which are generally inequality-
reducing.9 On  balance, the  evidence  does

remittances  sent 

not  support  the  view  that  migration  leads
unequivocally to higher inequality in send-
ing countries.

In receiving countries, migration relieves
labor  shortages  in  labor-intensive  sectors,
such as health care, hotels and restaurants,
and  construction. As  developed-country
populations  age  and  their  levels  of educa-
tion  and  training  rise, these  shortages  are
likely to become more severe. Demographic
trends  are  another  powerful  force  behind
migration. Current  population  projections
imply  that  the  labor  forces  of Europe  and
Japan will decline over the next century, and
that  the  ratio  of people  of working  age  to
people of retirement age (the support ratio)
will grow to levels that would make current
pension  and  social  transfer  schemes  unvi-
able. Meanwhile, the  population  of
the
North  Africa  countries  south  of Europe  is
growing rapidly.

Despite  its  large  beneﬁts, migration  is
ﬁercely  opposed 
in  receiving  countries.
Migration involves complex issues of national
and individual identity exacerbated by con-
cerns  over  security. Cultural  and  social
integration appears more difﬁcult in some
countries  than  it  was  earlier  thought.
Moreover, unskilled  workers  experience
wage  erosion  and  unemployment. For
industrial workers, however, this is no dif-
ferent than if goods produced in countries
with  lower  labor  costs  displace  domestic
production.

In sending countries, there are concerns
about the human and social costs of migra-
tion, for  instance, on  how  migration  of
nurses and doctors hinders progress toward
the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)
and  migration  of women  creates  major
deﬁcits  in  child  rearing, family  support,
and care for the elderly.10 Licensing restric-
tions  (as  for  doctors)  often  force  skilled
migrants  to  work  in  lower-skilled  jobs  in
host  countries—the  “brain  waste,” and
higher returns to education, do not appear
to  spur  human  capital  accumulation  or
“brain gain.”11

Going  against  the  political  tide—with
the  partial  exceptions  of some  currents  in
the  United  States, Canada  and  Spain—we
argue that greater migration would be good
for both equity and efﬁciency. But what are

B O X   1 0 . 2 Making migrant worker schemes more

development friendly

Attention to the design of temporary migrant
worker schemes and complementary policies
could make them more development
friendly.Temporary migration schemes usu-
ally allow workers into a country from several
weeks to up to three to ﬁve years.

Recent research for the United Kingdom

identiﬁed two main policy interventions:
centralized recruitment with government
screening in sending countries, and manda-
tory saving schemes, possibly coupled with
credit schemes in home countries. Central-
ized recruitment and government screening

could help reduce exploitation of potential
migrants by local recruitment agencies and
ensure that temporary migrants do not
overstay their visas, reducing resistance in
receiving countries. Saving schemes would
encourage migrants to send remittances
home, increase incentives to return, and
facilitate the start of productive activities on
return. Good examples are the Canada-Mex-
ico program for agricultural workers and the
agreement between France and Sri Lanka
on sharing information about migrants.

the  prospects  for  greater  migration  in  the
current political climate? Multilateral nego-
tiations  in  the  World  Trade  Organization
(WTO)  offer  a  framework  to  address
migration  under  Mode  IV  of the  General
Agreement  in  Trade  and  Services  (GATS),
part  of the  treaty  establishing  the  WTO.12
But progress toward greater liberalization of
temporary migration under GATS Mode IV
is  unlikely  in  the  near  future, given  that
contentious issues on agricultural and mer-
chandise trade are dominating negotiations
on the Doha Round.

In this context, progress is more likely to
come  from  bilateral  and  regional  negotia-
tions. Receiving  countries  could  bilaterally
expand temporary migration (box 10.2 dis-
cusses  some  features  of “development-
friendly” temporary  migration  schemes).
These  countries  could  also  extend  greater
protection to migrants. One way to do this
could be to ratify the 1990 U.N. Convention
on  the  Rights  of All  Migrant Workers  and
Their  Families. If a  signiﬁcant  number  of
host  countries  were  to  ratify  the  conven-
tion, none  would  risk  being  considered  a
haven  for  undocumented  migrants, and
fears  about  ratiﬁcation  leading  to  greater
inﬂows  might  be  allayed.13 Facilitating
remittance  ﬂows  is  another  action  with
potentially  high  payoffs, and  governments
should work together with the private sec-
tor and NGOs to achieve this.14

Sending countries should take action to
reduce  the  likelihood  that  their  migrants
become  victims  of exploitation, with  a
focus on combating trafﬁcking of girls and

women.15 Two possible areas for action are
to  better  regulate  recruitment  agencies  to
ensure  greater  respect  for  workers’ rights
and  to  enter  agreements  that  regulate
migrant ﬂows and conditions with key des-
tination  countries, as  the  Philippines  has
done. Sending  countries  should  also  help
migrants  use  remittances  properly, invest
back home, and reintegrate upon return.

system—might  help 

It  is  unclear  whether  an  international
organization in which poor countries have
an equal seat at the table could help make
progress  toward  freer  migration. Bhagwati
(2003) argued that a new World Migration
Organization—or even a stronger Interna-
tional  Organization  for  Migration  in  the
U.N.
increase  the
developmental impact of migration by pro-
tecting  migrants’ rights, providing  a  forum
to  set  rules  on  migration, and  monitoring
and  enforcing  compliance. But  migrant-
receiving developed countries resist propos-
als to give up even some control over immi-
gration policies, which they view as part of
the domestic policy agenda.

Freer and fairer trade
Inequities  in  the  trade  arena  are  well
known: rich countries protect their markets
with  tariff and  nontariff barriers  on  the
goods  that  poor  countries  produce  more
advantageously  (such  as  agricultural  pro-
duce and textiles). They provide handsome
subsidies  to  their  farmers, subsidize  their
exports, and  discourage  value-added  pro-
cessing  in  developing  countries. Reducing
such protection and subsidies would have a
beneﬁcial  impact  on  world  trade, growth,
and poverty reduction.

Potential  beneﬁts  from  liberalization. Sev-
eral recent studies have estimated the poten-
tial  impact  of various  trade  liberalization
measures, including  those  being  considered
during  the  Doha  Round  of negotiations
under  the WTO. Estimates  vary, depending
on the reforms considered (various packages
of partial  reforms  up  to  full  liberalization)
and on whether dynamic productivity gains
are taken into account. At the lower end of
the range, Hertel and Winters (forthcoming)
estimated that the measures being discussed
in  the  Doha  Round  would  have  a  modest

Achieving greater global equity

211

impact  on  world  prices, welfare  gains, and
poverty, with  the  number  of people  living
below  $2  a  day  declining  by  9  million  in
2015  over  a  baseline  estimate  of around  2
billion. According to this study, even full lib-
eralization would not bring huge gains, as it
would help lift 80 million people out of $2 a
day poverty. At the higher end of the range,
Cline (2004) estimated that full trade liber-
alization would lift up to 440 million people
out of $2 a day poverty by 2015.

Whatever  the  size  of the  overall  impact,
researchers agree that it would be heteroge-
neous across countries and regions. In both
partial  and  full  reform  scenarios, the  gains
would  accrue  mostly  to  large  countries
already  signiﬁcantly  integrated  in  global
markets, such  as  Brazil, China, India, and
Indonesia. Parts of many Sub-Saharan coun-
tries and remote areas in Asia and elsewhere
are simply not connected to global markets,
and farmers eke out a living on subsistence
agriculture, far from roads, markets, technol-
ogy, and  information. Many  countries  are
unable to make full use of improved market
access because of signiﬁcant supply-side and
institutional constraints. Detailed studies on
Cambodia, Ethiopia, Madagascar, and Zam-
bia showed that the potential impact of the
trade  reforms  likely  to  be  included  in  the
Doha Round would be small for such coun-
tries. Some countries would even lose in the
short run: Bangladesh and Mozambique, for
instance, would  experience  a  decline  in
incomes, as  existing  preferences  are  eroded
and the prices of key food imports rise. Sim-
ilarly, Bourguignon, Levin, and  Rosenblatt
(2004b) found that countries in the bottom
two deciles of the international distribution
of income would beneﬁt more from a dou-
bling of aid over current levels than from full
trade reform. The estimated impact of trade
liberalization varies greatly within countries
as well (chapter 9).

Speciﬁc  liberalization  measures  would
also  have  differential  impacts. Anderson
and Martin (2004) found that the removal
of OECD agricultural subsidies would hurt
net  food-importing  least  developed  coun-
tries, such as those in the Middle East and
North Africa, and countries that now enjoy
special preferences, such as the Philippines,
the  consequent  increase  in
because  of

prices.16 But net food-producing countries,
and  farmers  within  them, would  beneﬁt.
There is, indeed, some evidence that rising
agricultural world prices were partly respon-
sible  for  the  fact  that  rural  incomes  in
China  grew  more  rapidly  than  urban
incomes in 2004.

The phasing out of the Multi-Fiber Agree-
ment, which set quotas on exports of textiles
from developing countries, also has heteroge-
neous  effects. Chinese  textile  exports  have
made  signiﬁcant  gains  in  markets  not  pro-
tected by tariffs—for instance, their share of
Australian and Japanese markets, where there
were  no  quota  restrictions, is  70  percent.
Their share of the U.S. baby clothes segment,
where quotas were removed in 2002, jumped
from 11 to 55 percent in two years. Exports
from  Cambodia  and  Nepal  are  reported  to
have  declined  signiﬁcantly. The  impact  of
these shifts on global income inequality is not
clear and it depends on the relative position
of garment  workers  and  of those  beneﬁting
from  indirect  effects  in  the  global  distribu-
tion. Changes in the existing tariff structure,
whereby  producers  from  the  poorest  coun-
tries have duty-free access to markets in the
United States and Europe while others face a
16 percent tariff on average, would also have
an  unclear  impact  on  inequality.17 Con-
versely, renewed protectionism in developed
countries is likely to have negative effects.

Currently, no global assistance program
exists to compensate losers from trade lib-
eralization. However,
international  assis-
tance  to  help  meet  adjustment  costs  is  an
important  focus, along  with  addressing
supply-side  constraints, of current  efforts
by a range of donors, recipients, and inter-
national organizations, including the World
Bank, to increase aid for trade in the context
of the WTO Doha round.

Setting trade rules. Where do the rules that
govern  trade  come  from, and  what  are  the
chances  of changes?  Trade  rules, including
the most egregiously inequitable, are part of
complex multilateral, regional, and bilateral
agreements. As mentioned in box 10.1, there
are signiﬁcant concerns about the fairness of
WTO decision-making processes, and these
processes are partly responsible for the cur-
rent stalemate in negotiations.

212

WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2006

But  the  reality  of WTO  negotiations  is
complex. In the WTO, each country has one
vote, and the practice of decision making by
consensus  means  that  each  country  can
veto  decisions  (although  the  practice  of
“single undertaking,” or voting on all mat-
ters  together,
in  practice  weakens  veto
power). Countries choose to sign on to the
WTO following not only extensive external
negotiations  but  also  domestic  decision-
making  processes. So  this  is  not  a  prima
facie example  of unfair  rule-setting. In
practice, however, poor countries ﬁnd it dif-
ﬁcult to follow negotiations, to understand
the implications of proposals to them, and
to develop alternative proposals—we saw in
chapter 3 that even their capacity to be pres-
ent in Geneva is limited.

So, in the end, the rules may at times be
unfair not because the formal processes are
unfair but because of the underlying power
imbalance  between  rich  countries  with
strong commercial interests and poor coun-
tries  with  weak  capacity.18 The  balance  is
even tilted against taxpayers and consumers

in  rich  countries, who  often  stand  to  lose
from  the  protection  of vested  commercial
interests. Consider, for example, cotton sub-
sidies (see box 10.3) and international car-
tels.19 Poor countries are in an even weaker
position  when  negotiating  bilaterally  with
stronger  trading  partners  than  they  are
when  negotiating  multilaterally. Paradoxi-
cally, in light of the intense antiglobalization
protests, multilateral  negotiations  in  the
context of the WTO hold the greatest prom-
ise  to  reduce  inequities  that  harm  poor
countries. Although  even  an  ambitious
Doha Round would bring limited beneﬁts, it
remains  an 
important  goal  to  pursue
because  failure  would  further  undermine
conﬁdence in multilateral negotiations.

The WTO has another advantage: it pro-
vides  for  a  mechanism  to  adjudicate  dis-
putes. This  is  important, as  seen  earlier, to
ensure that international law is applied and
enforced. The  WTO  dispute  settlement
mechanism provides a forum for poor coun-
tries  to  bring  complaints  and  possibly  win
them. Unfortunately, winning  a  case  does

B O X   1 0 . 3 Cotton subsidies are huge—and tenacious

The International Cotton Advisory Committee
estimated that, in 2001/02, direct production
assistance by the eight countries that provided
subsidies (United States, China, the European
Union, and to a much smaller extent Turkey,
Egypt, Mexico, Brazil, Cote d’Ivoire, in that order)
was around $5.8 billion.Direct assistance to U.S.
cotton producers reached $3.3 billion, China’s sup-
port totaled $1.2 billion (although some question
this estimate), and the European Union’s support
was $979 million (for Greece and Spain) (Interna-
tional Cotton Advisory Committee 2003).The
main impact of U.S.and European subsidies is to
make cotton produced in the United States and
Europe competitive and depress world prices.It is
estimated that in 2001/02 prices would have been
71 percent higher without subsidies.

Subsidies beneﬁt large rich farmers in the

United States and not-so-rich but relatively well-
off farmers in Europe, and harm poor, small
farmers in Africa. Cotton is a crucial commodity
for a number of poor African and Central Asian
countries, contributing up to 40 percent of mer-
chandise exports and 5 to 10 percent of GDP.
Most growers are smallholders, so the impact of
cotton prices on poverty is signiﬁcant. A study
on Benin found that a 40 percent reduction in
farmgate cotton prices—equivalent to the price
decline from December 2000 to May 2002—

implied an 8 percent reduction in rural per
capita income in the short run and a 6 to 7 per-
cent reduction in the long run, with the
incidence of poverty among cotton growers ris-
ing in the short run from 37 percent to 59 per-
cent (Minot and Daniels 2002).

Estimates of the impact of subsidy removal
on cotton prices are in the range of 8 to 12 per-
cent. Increases of this magnitude would not
hurt consumers—the price of raw cotton is a
small component of the price of textiles and
garments. Full subsidy removal and the conse-
quent rise in prices would help African
countries, although the distribution of in-coun-
try beneﬁts would depend on domestic reforms.
A recent study of the impact of subsidy removal
on three cotton-producing provinces of Zambia,
for instance, indicates that the direct impact of
the subsequent cotton price increase would be
small: about 1 percent of income on average.
Greater gains would require farmers switching
from subsistence crops to cotton, which in turn
requires complementary domestic reforms in
extension services and robust growth of
demand for cotton exports (Balat and Porto
forthcoming).

Beneﬁts to African countries would increase
if they were to expand their clothing production
and exports.The U.S. African Growth and Oppor-

tunity Act provides an opening, but under
rather restrictive conditions: apparel from 14
African countries gets duty-free and quota-free
access to U.S. markets, but only if made from
U.S. fabric, yarn, and thread. So to take
advantage of this provision, countries need to
establish an effective input visa system to
ensure compliance with rules of origin (Baffes
2004), which seems exceedingly complex.

Within the WTO, poor cotton-producing

West African countries took the unusual step of
issuing a joint statement calling for full subsidy
removal and for cotton to be treated separately.
But the July 2004 Framework Agreement of the
Doha Development Agenda does not include
separate treatment of cotton, stating only that
cotton will receive “adequate priority” in agricul-
tural negotiations. Subsidy removal is politically
unlikely.

In the current climate, a second-best option

would be to implement well-designed decou-
pled support, in which subsidies do not depend
on production and thus do not encourage over-
production and consequent “dumping,” as is the
case with the current schemes. Existing mecha-
nisms would need to be reformed, because they
still depend on acreage and thus create incen-
tives for overproduction. Less overproduction
may help lift prices a bit.

not automatically bring redress: the loser in
the case may not necessarily change its action.
The existing mechanisms to enforce decisions
rely on voluntary compensation of the loser
and, when this is not satisfactory, the possibil-
ity of retaliatory action (such as suspension of
tariff and  other  concessions)  on  the  part  of
the  winner. Clearly, poor  countries’ retalia-
tion  against  powerful  trading  partners  is
unlikely to provide much of an incentive for
rich  countries  to  comply  with  unfavorable
rulings, because of their typically smaller vol-
ume  of
trade  with  a  developed-country
defendant. Even  so, developing  countries
have  in  recent  years  brought  forward, and
won, an increasing number of cases.

The  fair  and  ethical  trade  movements.
Interestingly, some NGOs and civil society
organizations in both developed and devel-
oping countries have acted directly to estab-
lish  more  equitable  trade  relations. One
such example is “fair trade.” Fair trade ini-
tiatives, led  by  consumer  groups, NGOs,
trade unions, and other civil society organi-
zations, aim  to  control  the  supply  chain
from production to market to improve the
well-being  of developing-country  produc-
ers by ensuring a stable price for their com-
modities, linking  them  more  directly  with
markets  in  rich  countries, and  strengthen-
ing  their  organizations. The  approach  is
working: sales of fair trade bananas, cocoa,
coffee, brown  sugar, tea, and  a  few  other
products have seen phenomenal growth in
recent years and now represent a signiﬁcant
share  of exports  for  some  countries  (for
instance, 11 percent of Ecuadorian bananas
and 20 percent of Ghanaian coffee are now
sold through fair trade).

The  few  impact  studies  that  exist  show
that fair trade initiatives have indeed made a
difference to producers, not only through the
premiums  paid  over  world  prices  but  also
thanks  to  the  services  and  assistance  pro-
vided  to  farmers  by  producer  cooperatives
supported by fair trade organizations. When
inequities arise from unequal access to mar-
kets  and  lack  of information, credit, and 
risk-mitigation  mechanisms, strengthening
producer associations can lead to more equi-
table  outcomes, even  without  paying  a  pre-
mium, in the context of existing trade rules.20

The reach of fair trade initiatives, while
growing, remains  small. In  Switzerland,
where  consumer  support  is  strong,
fair
trade bananas still represented only 25 per-
cent of overall banana purchases and con-
sumer  spending  on  all  fair  trade  products
was  a  mere  $10  per  person  in  2002  (Swiss
agricultural subsidies amounted to roughly
$750  per  person  in  the  same  year). Fair
trade coffee accounts for, at most, 3 percent
of world sales, and only about 20 percent of
the capacity of certiﬁed fair trade producers
is absorbed by the fair trade circuit.21

Another  example  of organizations  act-
ing  directly  to  establish  more  equitable
trade  relations  is  the  growing  number  of
initiatives for corporate social responsibil-
ity  and  ethical  trade. Companies  that  join
an  ethical  trade  organization, such  as  the
Ethical  Trading  Initiative  in  the  United
Kingdom or the Fair Labor Association in
the United States, pledge to respect a code
of conduct in return for favorable consid-
eration  by  consumers  and  investors  who
care about equitable development.22 Codes
of conduct  generally  cover  fair 
labor
practices (usually those set out in ILO con-
ventions), environmental  standards, and
monitoring  mechanisms—and  apply  not
just  to  a  ﬁrm’s  direct  production  facilities
but  also  to  those  of all  its  suppliers  along
the supply chain.

Are consumers in rich countries willing
to pay a bit more to ensure that the goods
they buy are produced in fair and safe con-
ditions?  Proponents  of codes  of conduct
believe  they  are. Researchers  found  that
almost  90  percent  of Americans  said  they
would pay at least an extra $1 on a $20 item
if they  could  be  sure  it  had  not  been  pro-
duced  by  exploited  workers.23 Skeptics
point  to  the  fact  that  prices  dominate  the
decisions of the major corporate buyers.

Codes  of conduct  inspired  by  ethical
considerations might have a positive impact
on  equity, but  are  they  applied?  Impact
studies  conducted  by  the  Ethical  Trading
Initiative found mixed evidence. Consumers
may  not  be  willing  to  pay  higher  prices  in
exchange  for  an  uncertain  (and  often
unmonitored)  positive  impact. Consumer
pressure may thus not be enough (box 10.4).
So, these initiatives, while important, are no

214

B O X   1 0 . 4 Will improved working conditions 

in Cambodia’s textile industry survive 
the end of the quota system?

As mentioned in chapter 9, the 1999 bilat-
eral trade agreement between Cambodia
and the United States included a provision
whereby Cambodia’s clothing exports
would increase each year if labor standards
improved.The ILO was mandated to prepare
a report twice a year based on factory visits
and interviews with workers and unions
and to make it widely available.

The provision helped bring about a grad-

ual improvement in working conditions in
clothing factories, but this progress is under
threat with the end of the quota system.The
government agreed to continue ILO inspec-
tions until 2008, but employers can no longer
count on increases in exports to the United
States if they uphold labor standards. Some
are aware that labor standards compliance is
their only real competitive advantage, but

there are reports of union leaders being
ﬁred, lack of adherence to minimum and
overtime pay rules, and repressed demon-
strations. Employers are allegedly using the
threat of tough competition from China to
cut salaries and beneﬁts. But the employers
are being watched—an independent union
movement has grown in the industry and
ILO monitoring is increasingly sophisticated.
Monitors are now using hand-held comput-
ers to transmit ﬁndings from their factory
visits, allowing timely reporting. If working
conditions deteriorate, activists, researchers,
unions, and, most important of all, consumers
will know.Whether their pressure will be
enough to ensure adherence to labor stan-
dards is an open question.

Trade Unions (2005),Washington Post (2004).

substitute  for  more  equitable  trade  rules
under the WTO and other arrangements.

Intellectual property rights 
and the global market for ideas
Protection  of
intellectual  property  rights
(IPR) is another area in which market failure
and  power  structures  shape  unequal  pro-
cesses  and  outcomes; the  interests  of a  few
powerful actors impose costs on the general
public, particularly  the  poor. The  require-
ment set forth in the Trade-Related Aspects of
Intellectual  Property  Rights  agreement
(TRIPS)24—that  all  member  countries  offer
20-year  patent  protection—is  perceived  by
many  to  be  grossly  inequitable. Because
patent  protection  was  adopted  in  OECD
countries before the 1990s, the main result of
this requirement is to strengthen patent pro-
tection in poor countries that become WTO
members. Countries adopting patent protec-
tion  today  are  doing  so  at  levels  of GDP
between  $500  and  $8,000  per  capita, while
OECD countries did so when their GDP per
capita was around $20,000 in 1995 prices.25

Patents stem from a legitimate desire to
provide  incentives  for  the  generation  of
knowledge and cover the cost of developing
new  knowledge. A  drug  or  other  patented
innovation cannot be copied while a patent
is in force, so developers enjoy a monopoly

position  and  can  charge  higher  prices.
Extending  patent  protection  to  developing
countries can thus increase total proﬁts by
allowing  companies  to  earn  them  in  poor
countries—and changes the distribution of
R&D ﬁnancing, with a greater share borne
by poorer countries. But protection of IPR
must  be  balanced  by  the  concern  that  it
restricts access to new technologies. Patents
restrict  access  to  innovations  by  making
them more expensive and more difﬁcult to
copy. There  is  great  concern  in  developing
countries  on  the  availability  of various
innovations, including  patented  seeds  and
drugs. Antiretroviral  drugs  to  ﬁght  AIDS
are a case in point (box 10.5).

We look in more detail at pharmaceutical
patents  as  an  illustration  of the  broader
issues. Chaudhuri, Goldberg, and Jia (2004)
estimate  that  the  gains  to  the  Indian  econ-
omy from not following international patent
protection standards were around $450 mil-
lion, of which  $400  million  were  a  gain  to
consumers  and  the  rest  proﬁts  of domestic
producers. Proﬁt losses to foreign producers
were  only  around  $53  million  a  year. This
study illustrates the important point that the
proﬁts pharmaceutical companies could gain
in poor countries are not very large. Lanjouw
and  Jack  (2004)  estimate  that  extending
patent protection to developing countries to
20 years would be equivalent, for ﬁrm prof-
its, to extending patents in developed coun-
tries by two weeks.

A solution exists that would lead to more
equitable  provision  without  undermining
efﬁciency: wherever  rich  country  markets
already  support  the  cost  of research, poor
countries  could  be  allowed  to  produce  or
import  cheaper  generic  substitutes, at  no
signiﬁcant  cost  to  either  rich  countries  or
the ﬁrms that carry out research (see focus 7
on drug access at the end of this chapter).

As with all international law, the existing
IPR protection rules are the result of com-
plex negotiations. TRIPS—which was basi-
cally written by industry lawyers26—is part
of the  agreement  establishing  the  WTO, a
multifaceted  deal  that  included  the  Multi-
Fiber Agreement and other provisions that
developing  countries  deemed  beneﬁcial  to
them. Many bilateral free trade agreements

B O X   1 0 . 5 Expanding access to antiretroviral drugs in South Africa

In response to the rising AIDS crisis, the govern-
ment of South Africa in 1997 amended the Med-
icines and Related Substances Control Act of
1965 in an attempt to ensure the supply of more
affordable drugs to all South Africans.The
amendment encouraged pharmacists to substi-
tute costly patented drugs with cheaper generic
equivalents, allowed for the importation of
cheaper drugs available on the market
elsewhere (parallel imports), and introduced a
compulsory licensing system allowing competi-
tors to produce patented drugs.

The Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Associ-

ation and 39 drug companies challenged the
government’s legislation in the Pretoria High
Court on several grounds, including that it
violated South Africa’s obligations under 
TRIPS. The Treatment Action Campaign (TAC)
and a labor union, COSATU, supported the gov-
ernment defense in the case, asserting that the
legislation was valid in that it constituted the
government’s positive duty to fulfill the right
to health. Arguably as a result of public pres-
sure and attention, the Pharmaceutical Manu-
facturers Association and the drug companies
withdrew their case. An indirect result was to
bring down the price of antiretroviral medicine

from about 4,000 rand a month to 1,000 rand a
month.

Other legal cases (not involving TRIPS)

helped expand access to antiretroviral drugs. In
2002, a group of complainants, including TAC,
brought a case against GlaxoSmithKline and
Boehringer Ingelheim at the South African Com-
petition Commission. In its October 2004 ruling,
the commission found that the two ﬁrms had
engaged in excessive pricing of patented anti-
retrovirals and refused to allow generic produc-
tion of the drugs in return for royalty payments,
actions that the commission ruled were in viola-
tion of the South Africa Competition Act.To
keep the case from moving to a higher tribunal,
the ﬁrms came to a settlement agreement that
included licensing generic production.

TAC also attempted to compel the national

and provincial governments to provide
antiretroviral drugs to all pregnant women to
prevent the transmission of HIV from mothers to
their children; the impact of the existing govern-
ment policy was to make the drug Nevirapine
unavailable in public health facilities other than
the 10 or so pilot sites.The government
appealed to the Constitutional Court after TAC
secured a successful decision.

The Constitutional Court declared that the
South African Constitution required the South
African government to devise and implement
within its available resources a comprehensive
and coordinated program to realize
progressively the rights of pregnant women and
their newborn children to have access to health
services to combat mother-to-child transmission
of HIV.The Court found the state policy of
restricting the availability of antiretroviral drugs
and related services for preventing mother-to-
child transmission of HIV to a few pilot test sites
unreasonable, and ordered the government to
rectify the situation by taking reasonable steps
to facilitate the availability and use of antiretrovi-
ral drugs in all public health facilities.

In 1999,TAC had also been part of a success-
ful constitutional challenge relating to discrimi-
nation of South African Airways cabin
attendants with HIV.The judgment reinforced
the right to equality for people with HIV.These
legal challenges had important indirect impacts,
setting groundbreaking precedents, increasing
judicial awareness of human rights obligations,
and heightening public awareness of rights.

United  States  and  Chile, Jordan, Morocco,
Singapore, Vietnam, and  others)  include
even  stronger  IPR  protection  rules  than
TRIPS, such  as  granting  patent  extensions
on  pharmaceuticals  and  speciﬁc  types  of
protection  on  clinical  trial  data  submitted
to  obtain  marketing  approval. Signatories
to  these  agreements  agreed  on  these  rules
generally in exchange for preferential access
to U.S. markets for their products.

But it is hard to argue that the parties to
these  various  bilateral  and  multilateral
agreements  were  on  a  level  playing  ﬁeld.
Poor  countries  are  in  a  weaker  bargaining
position overall. For example, the preferen-
tial access they gain through bilateral trade
agreements  is  eroded  whenever  the  United
States reduces remaining tariffs and quotas
in  bilateral  or  multilateral  negotiations,
while IPR protection does not weaken over
time.27 Moreover, the issues involved in IPR
protection  are  complex  and  require  skills
and  capacity  that  rich  countries  can  better
afford—often with input from pharmaceu-
tical  ﬁrms. Some  capacity-building  efforts
for developing countries are under way, but

at  least  some  of the  agencies  responsible
(such  as  WIPO  and  developed-country
patent  ofﬁces)  are  perceived  as  biased.
Inequitable as TRIPS may be, it still provides
an  internationally  agreed  standard  subject
to  intense  scrutiny  and  study, which  does
make it harder for rich countries to get more
favorable deals in bilateral agreements.

An  additional  advantage  of negotiating
sessions  under  the  WTO  is  that  they  pro-
vide  focal  events  for  mobilizing  public
opinion. An example of how positive results
can be achieved within the WTO process is
the  Declaration  on  the  TRIPS  Agreement
and Public Health adopted at Doha in 2001,
which afﬁrms the primacy of public health
concerns over IPR protection. Three subse-
quent U.S. bilateral agreements include side
letters on public health that afﬁrm the sig-
natories’ understanding that IPR protection
does not affect their ability to “protect pub-
lic health by promoting medicines for all.”28

the  spotlight, as  drug  companies  managed

work Agreement, monitoring progress and
campaigning  become  more  difﬁcult. So
multilateral  negotiations  within  the  WTO,
which are held under the spotlight, proba-
bly  hold  the  most  promise  in  terms  of
adopting more equitable rules.

Financial market liberalization
Capital  ﬂows  to  developing  countries  have
grown tremendously in the 1990s, bringing
both advantages and challenges. Short-term
capital  ﬂows  are  at  times  accused  of con-
tributing  to  ﬁnancial  instability  while  not
enhancing growth in countries with imma-
ture  ﬁnancial  systems. Most  countries  that
received high volumes of short-term capital
inﬂows  in  the  1990s—Argentina, Brazil,
Indonesia, Korea, Mexico, Russia, Thailand,
and  Turkey—have  been  hit  by  ﬁnancial
crises, triggered or deepened by the ﬂight of
foreign short-term capital.

Domestic factors play a key role in ﬁnan-
cial  instability, but  global  rules  also  play  a
role. For  instance, debt  workout  mecha-
nisms follow informal processes; the IMF’s
proposal  for  a  Sovereign  Debt  Workout
Mechanism  was  not  adopted. The  result  is
that  deals  tend  to  beneﬁt  international
lenders at the expense of domestic investors
and taxpayers.29

In  contrast  to  short-term  capital  ﬂows,
foreign direct investment (FDI) is generally
regarded  as  having  a  positive  impact  on
receiving countries, but it goes to only a few
countries. In  2002, 84  percent  of FDI  to
developing  counties  went  to  12  mostly
middle-income  countries  (including  China
and India), with the other 150-odd develop-
ing  countries  receiving  almost  nothing.
Only 5.3 percent of FDI went to Sub-Saharan
Africa.30 Domestic  factors  play  a  key  role
also in determining the location of FDI, but
again global rules contribute to inequitable
outcomes. The Basel II Capital Accord, that
sets  capital  adequacy  standards  for  banks,
may overestimate the risk of bank lending to
developing  countries  (in  part  because  it
ignores  the  beneﬁts  of diversifying  portfo-
lios  across  countries), thus  raising  the  cost
and  reducing  access  to  external  capital, in
addition  to  increasing  the  procyclicality  of
loans and possibly contributing to increased
volatility.31 Emerging  global  standards—

including those assessed under the Reports
on the Observance of Standards and Codes
(ROSC),
international  accounting  stan-
dards, and the Core 25 Principles for Bank-
ing  Supervision—are  also  costly  for  devel-
oping countries and may not be appropriate
to their level of development.

Rules-setting  in  global  ﬁnancial  markets.
Some  of the  key  rules  governing  global
ﬁnancial markets are developed by institu-
tions to which developing countries do not
belong. The  Financial  Stability  Forum,
established  in  1999  to  promote  global
ﬁnancial  stability, brings  together  senior
representatives  of central  banks, supervi-
sory  authorities  and  treasury  departments
of nine  OECD  countries,
international
ﬁnancial  institutions, international  regula-
tory  and  supervisory  groupings, com-
mittees  of central  bank  experts, and  the
European Central Bank. The only emerging
market  economies  that  are  members  are
Hong Kong (China) and Singapore.

The Basel Committee on Banking Super-
vision, which developed the Basel II Capital
Accord, comprises  representatives  of the
central  banks  and  banking  supervision
authorities  of Belgium, Canada, France,
Germany, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, the
Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland,
the United Kingdom, and the United States.
Its main interlocutor in the development of
the  Accord  was  the  Institute  for  Interna-
tional Finance, a Washington-based consul-
tative  group  of major  international  banks.
Neither  the  Financial  Stability  Forum  nor
the Basel Committee can legitimately repre-
sent the interests of developing countries.32
Various other standards, often developed by
semiprivate  agencies  (such  as  the  Interna-
tional  Accounting  Standards  Board), are
based on practices in the United States and
European Union. Greater participation and
voice  in  rule-setting  bodies  would  help
ensure that outcomes are more favorable to
developing countries.

Rectifying past and present inequities
in the use of natural resources
The use of natural resources is another major
arena in which market failures and unequal
power  conjure  to  create  major  inequities.

Achieving greater global equity

217

This  is  greatly  skewed  in  favor  of devel-
oped  countries  and  impacts  are  grossly
inequitable. Without  major  technological
innovations  several  key  resources, such  as
oil, could be exhausted before the world’s
poor  get  a  chance  to  attain  standards  of
living  comparable  to  those  of
today’s
developed-country 
citizens. Moreover,
global  warming  threatens  to  destroy  the
livelihoods  of people  living  in  low-lying
coastal  areas, small  islands, and  semiarid
regions. Yet the people potentially affected
by these changes (tomorrow’s citizens and
many  of today’s  poor)  have  virtually  no
voice in setting rules.

The international community has taken
some steps to manage natural resources in a
more  equitable  way. Some  international
legal  instruments, such  as  the  Convention
on  the  Law  of the  Sea  of 1982, reﬂect  the
concept  of distributive  justice  discussed
earlier  by  taking  an  approach  whereby  the
seabed  and  ocean  ﬂoor, beyond  national
jurisdiction, are  classiﬁed  as  global  com-
mons  and  subject  to  a  system  of equitable
sharing  of the  economic  beneﬁts  derived
from activities in these areas.

Key  steps  toward  redressing  inequities
in the use of global resources are the 1992
U.N. Framework  Convention  on  Climate
Change and the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. The
protocol is structured to reflect the prin-
ciple  of “common  but  differentiated
responsibilities” between  developed  and
developing  countries. It  recognizes  that
industrial nations have emitted the major-
ity of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere,
causing  the  majority  of the  harm, and
places  greater  demands  on  them. It  sets
binding  quantified  commitments 
for
industrial countries to reduce their green-
house gas emissions by 2008–12, with the
understanding  that  the  agreement  would
include  emission  reduction  efforts  by
developing nations some time after 2012.

One important aspect of the Kyoto Pro-
tocol  is  the  unique  set  of provisions  that
allow industrial nations to meet their com-
mitments  through  actions  not  only  within
their borders but also outside. One of these
provisions, the Clean Development Mecha-
nism, helps address the perceived inequality
of obligations and the costs of compliance.

It  allows  industrial  countries  to  purchase
emission  reduction  “credits” generated
from  activities  that  reduce  greenhouse  gas
emissions  in  developing  countries  and  to
apply these credits against their obligations
under the Protocol. It thus assists industrial
countries  in  meeting  their  commitments
under  the  Kyoto  Protocol  more  cost  effec-
tively  and  promotes  sustainable  develop-
ment  in  developing  countries,
through
supporting  greater  investments  in  cleaner,
more  efﬁcient  technologies  as  well  as
forestry projects.

Fairness  in  processes  is  also  an  issue. In
negotiating  the  Kyoto  Protocol, as  in  most
global treaty negotiations, industrial nations
had  greater  power  at  the  negotiating  table.
An imbalance of technical expertise, a lack of
adequate  public  support  for  the  issues, and
problems  forming  coalitions  because  of
diverse interests have attenuated the bargain-
ing power for many developing countries.

The United States, the single largest emit-
ter of greenhouse gases, has announced that
it is not becoming a party to the Kyoto Pro-
tocol, signiﬁcantly  reducing  the  protocol’s
efﬁcacy. With the protocol having come into
effect  in  February  2005, the  United  States
will be a mere observer at the Meetings of the
Parties to the Kyoto Protocol, but because of
the size of its emissions, the other parties will
not want to ignore U.S. concerns.33

Equitable  access  to  information  is  an
important  ingredient  for  more  equitable
use  of global  resources. The  UN/ECE
Convention on Access to Information, Pub-
lic  Participation  in  Decision-making  and
Access to Justice in Environmental Matters
(Aarhus Convention) deals with public par-
ticipation  in  environmental  management
and access to information on environmen-
tal issues. The Convention, adopted in 1998
and  in  force  among  35  parties  since  2001,
grants  citizens  the  right  to  impose  obliga-
tions  on  public  authorities  and  parties  to
international  environmental  conventions,
including information disclosure, access to
information, public  participation  in  envi-
ronmental  decision  making, and  access  to
justice. A  Convention  Compliance  Com-
mittee  has  been  established, to  which  citi-
zens  and  NGOs  can  bring  allegations  of
noncompliance.

Providing development assistance
to help build endowments
In  shaping  global  inequities, rules  and
processes  interact  with  unequal  endow-
ments. Even  if all  the  reforms  suggested  in
the  previous  sections  were  implemented,
many poor countries would still not be able
to  participate  in  global  markets  because  of
their  limited  endowments  of skills, capital,
infrastructure, knowledge, and ideas. Action
to build endowments is primarily domestic,
through  private  and  public  investments  in
infrastructure and other areas. Can domes-
tic action be supported by aid? 

Better development assistance
From an equity perspective, the main roles
of aid  are  to  help  countries  build  the
endowments  of those  who  are  resource-
poor, generally  through  no  fault  of their
own, and avoid extreme deprivation (which
justiﬁes  to  some  extent  the  use  of aid  to
support  current  consumption). The  focus
on building endowments implies that both
the level of aid and its effectiveness matter.

Enhancing aid effectiveness. If the goal is to
equalize  opportunities  for  the  poor, aid
effectiveness  is  crucial. Aid  that  sustains
corruption or marginal projects, or is used
to increase the resources at the disposal of
the  rich, does  not  help. Aid  effectiveness
hinges  crucially  on  aid  delivery  modalities
and  on  the  fairness  and  transparency  of
domestic political processes. Birdsall (2004)
cites  seven  “deadly  sins”: impatience  with
institution  building, failure  to  exit, failure
to  evaluate, pretending  that  participation
equals  ownership, failure  to  collaborate,
stingy and unreliable ﬁnancing, and under-
funding of regional and global programs—
in  addition  to  tying  aid  to  the  use  of con-
sultants and ﬁrms from the donor country
and allocating it according to political pri-
orities. Existing  aid  planning  and  delivery
practices are rooted in political and incen-
tive  constraints  that  the  donors  face, so
change is difﬁcult and slow. But some cur-
rent directions are promising: emphasizing
results (including through tracking indica-
tors  of intermediate  actions  and  ﬁnal  out-
comes related to the MDGs), moving away
from  ex  ante  conditionality, and  progres-

sively  shifting  design  and  management
from donors to countries. The United King-
dom’s  Commission  for  Africa  (2005)  rec-
ommended a major shift away from ex ante
conditionality toward a new partnership in
which  African  countries  continue  to  work
to  improve  governance  and  accountability,
and  donors  deliver  more, cheaper, more
predictable  aid. High  levels  of aid  reduce
the  need  for  domestic  tax  efforts, which
have  historically  helped  strengthen  overall
accountability  of governments  and  citizen
demand  for  quality  services, so  particular
attention  should  be  paid  to  revenue  col-
lection.34 The  preparation  of poverty
reduction strategies is a key, if imperfect,
instrument to shift to country-led processes
with  greater  participation  and  monitoring
of how public resources are spent.

Fragile  states  pose  a  special  challenge.
Stabilization  and  peacekeeping  need  to  be
complemented  with  efforts  to  build  state
institutions and legitimacy. The sequencing
of interventions matters—there is some evi-
dence  that  ring-fenced, long-term  invest-
ment  in  human  capital  development  and
working with NGOs and the private sector
can be useful ﬁrst steps. Technical assistance
appears more effective after reforms take off
and can help lay the basis for capital invest-
ment and service delivery interventions.35

When  domestic  political  processes  are
manifestly  inequitable  and  corrupt, donors
can try to support moves toward a more equi-
table revenue collection and allocation; decen-
tralization  to  lower  levels  of government,
which  can  challenge  central  control; and  the
strengthening of community-based organiza-
tions, the media, and domestic entrepreneur-
ship, which can help create a middle class with
a voice and a stake in better governance.

Improving  the  allocation  of aid. The  distri-
bution of aid matters as well. A lively debate
has taken place in recent years on aid alloca-
tion criteria. Burnside and Dollar (2000) and
Collier  and  Dollar  (2001, 2002)  found  that
aid was more effective in reducing poverty if
it  was  allocated  to  countries  that  followed
good policies and had good institutions. They
calculated  that  reallocating  actual  aid  pro-
vided  in  1996  across  countries  to  maximize
poverty reduction according to their formula

Achieving greater global equity

219

would have led to directing aid to roughly 20
instead  of the  60  countries  considered, and
lifted twice as many people out of poverty.36
Their  ﬁndings  have  been  questioned  by
Hansen  and  Tarp  (2001)  and  others, who
argued  that  their  analysis  does  not  take
country  conditions  into  account  and  is  not
robust to different speciﬁcations. If aid effec-
tiveness  varies  across  countries  not  because
of policies but as the result of different coun-
try circumstances, such as climate, a different
aid  allocation  rule  would  maximize  the
poverty  impact  of foreign  aid.37 Cogneau
and Naudet (2004) suggested an alternative
rule for aid allocation and showed that gains
in poverty reduction similar to those found
by Collier and Dollar could be obtained if aid
was  directed  to  countries  that  have  greater
structural disadvantages (geographic, histor-
ical, or economic, as discussed in chapter 3).
The  resulting  allocation  would  spread  the
risk  of poverty  more  evenly  across  the
world’s  population, while  reducing  global
poverty  almost  as  much  as  the  allocation
proposed by Collier and Dollar.

In  sum, an  equity  perspective  suggests
that an approach that does not take a coun-
try’s  circumstances  into  account  is  likely  to
ignore  important  information  about  need.
But  an  approach  that  ignores  aid  effective-
ness  does  not  lead  to  expanded  opportuni-
ties. To contribute toward an equalization of
opportunities across the world’s individuals,
aid should be targeted where the probability
is  greatest  that  it  effectively  reaches  those
with  the  most  limited  opportunities—the
poorest  of the  poor, in  opportunity  terms.
That  clearly  depends  on  the  poverty  and
deprivation levels in each country and on its
government’s  ability  and  political  commit-
ment to deliver the aid where and how it is
intended. But  more  research  is  needed  to
fully understand the causal mechanisms.

In  practice, recent  research  showed  that
many  donors  indeed  seem  to  rely  on  both
good  policies  and  poor  initial  conditions. A
study  of 40  donor  agencies  by  Dollar  and
Levin  (2004)  found  that  aid  was  positively
correlated  with  a  measure  of good  policies
and  with  per  capita  GDP, and  the  agencies
that  focused  the  most  on  good  policies  also
directed their aid to poor countries. However,
some fragile states (“aid orphans”) receive less

aid than predicted by their policy and institu-
tional strength, mostly because of dispropor-
tionately  low  ﬂows  from  bilateral  donors,
while others (“aid darlings”) received more.38

Increasing  aid  levels. Conditional  on  effec-
tiveness  and  distribution, levels  of aid  do
matter. Aid levels fell between 1990 and 2001
both  as  a  share  of rich  countries’ gross
national  income  (GNI)  and  in  nominal
terms. Calls  for  more  aid  to  help  countries
achieve the MDGs have resonated loudly in
recent  international  gatherings. At  the  2002
International  Conference  on  Financing  for
Development  in  Monterrey, rich  countries
committed  to  increasing  their  aid  ﬂows  sig-
niﬁcantly. Net aid ﬂows indeed increased sig-
niﬁcantly  in  2002–04  in  nominal  and  real
terms, reaching  $78  billion.39 Three  major
factors were behind these increases: continu-
ing  growth  in  bilateral  grants  (but  with  a
large  share  going  to  technical  cooperation,
debt  forgiveness, emergency  and  disaster
relief, and administrative costs); the provision
of reconstruction aid to Afghanistan and Iraq
by the United States (in 2004, $0.9 billion to
Afghanistan and $2.9 billion to Iraq); and the
depreciation  of the  U.S. dollar. While  there
was  a  small  increase  in  new  development
assistance  to  Sub-Saharan  Africa  in  2003,
even  after  accounting  for  debt  relief and
emergency assistance, Highly Indebted Poor
Countries (HIPC) received less in real terms
in 2004 than the year before. On the positive
side, the International Development Associa-
tion, the soft-lending arm of the World Bank,
recently received a replenishment for 2006–8,
which  is  at  least  25  percent  higher  than  the
previous one and represents the largest fund-
ing increase in two decades.

These  recent  increases  notwithstanding,
aid ﬂows remain small not just in relation to
need  but  also  in  comparison  to  domestic
human development and safety net programs
that aim to equalize opportunities and ensure
against deprivation. Such programs generally
account for more than 10 percent of GDP in
donor countries. Ofﬁcial development assis-
tance (ODA), by contrast, was only 0.25 per-
cent of donor countries’ GNI in 2003. Only
Denmark, Luxembourg,
the  Netherlands,
Norway, and Sweden meet the U.N. target of
providing ODA equal to or greater than 0.7

percent  of GNI. Many  countries  are  not  on
track to meet their Monterrey commitments
(table 10.1).

Aid also is low in comparison with other
uses  of public  resources. Agricultural  subsi-
dies, for  instance, were  almost  ﬁve  times
larger than aid in 2002. Japan, the European
Union, and  the  United  States  had  subsidies
equal to 1.4, 1.3, and 0.9 percent of GDP and
aid of 0.23, 0.35, and 0.13 percent respectively
(ﬁgure  10.2). Rich  countries  should  deliver
on their Monterrey commitments; this alone
would  add  around  $18  billion  to  develop-
ment  assistance  by  2006. To  make  further
progress  toward  the  0.7  percent  goal, coun-
tries could establish intermediate targets for
2010. But  again, higher  aid  that  is  poorly
spent, supports  corrupt  regimes, or  under-
mines  domestic  accountability  can  hinder,
rather than support, greater equity.

Additional  debt  relief. Aid  should  not  be
undermined by debt payments. Multilateral
debt, the largest share of debt for the HIPC,
is the result of loans received in the 1980s,
and  new  loans, while  generally  on  more
concessional terms, continue to add to the
debt burden. Supporters of debt relief argue
that  debt  payments  divert  scarce  resources
from  health  and  education  and  other  pro-
poor spending.

There has been progress in the last decade.
In 1995, debt relief was not on the agenda of
international organizations, partly because of
ﬁnancing  issues  and  partly  because  of con-
cerns about creating a moral hazard (if debts
are forgiven, governments of borrowing coun-
tries may think they are really not expected to
repay). Over the following ﬁve years, thanks to
a strong grassroots mobilization in rich coun-
tries, effective research on the impact of debt
and committed leadership in some rich coun-
tries and the World Bank, the HIPC Initiative
was launched and then expanded. As of March
2005, 27  countries  had  received  debt  relief
expected to amount to about $54 billion over
time, up from $34.5 billion at the end of 2000.
The ratio of debt service to exports for HIPC
has  declined  roughly  by  half, to  15  percent.
Poverty-reducing expenditures in the 27 coun-
tries that receive HIPC assistance are estimated
to have increased from 6.4 percent of GDP in
1999 to 7.9 percent of GDP in 2003.

Even so, many countries continue to bear
an  unsustainable  debt  burden, and  more
needs to be done. The agreements reached in
October  2004  to  extend  the  HIPC  Initiative
and  in  June  2005  to  grant  100  percent  debt
cancellation of the debt owed to the African
Development Bank, IMF, and World Bank to
18 countries are important steps.40 This and
any further debt relief should truly be addi-
tional  rather  than  substitute  fresh  aid. Fur-
ther debt relief should also be accompanied
by careful consideration of debt sustainability
issues, including  increasing  grants  for  very
low-income  countries, to  avoid  the  buildup
of unsustainable debt in the future.

Innovative mechanisms to fund development
assistance. Several  innovative  mechanisms
to expand development assistance are under
discussion,
International
Financing Facility (IFF), global taxes, and vol-

including 

the

the  United  Kingdom, given 

untary  contributions. The  IFF  would  make
future aid available for immediate use (front-
load aid) and possibly reduce volatility. It is
an  option  for  some  donors, such  as  France
and 
their
accounting  and  legislative  frameworks, but
not  for  others, who  would  not  be  able  to
make  long-term  commitments  or  consider
them off-budget. Even when feasible, the IFF
would move aid off-budget in the short term,
but  it  would  expand  ﬁnancing  for  develop-
ment  only  if it  increased  overall  aid  levels
rather than simply shift future aid forward.

Proposals involving global tax instruments
have also been advanced, including a “Tobin”
tax  on  short-term  capital  movements; taxes
related  to  pollution, such  as  a  global  carbon
tax, an  international  aviation  fuel  tax, and  a
maritime  pollution  tax; taxes  on  arms  sales;
and  surcharges  on  multinational  proﬁts  and
on value-added or income taxes. These pro-
posals would need to be assessed on the basis
of the revenues they could generate, their efﬁ-
ciency, collectability, feasibility, and  not  least
their impact on equity.

Voluntary  contributions  from  individuals,
corporations, private foundations, and NGOs—
another  source  of development  assistance
alongside  public  aid—are  increasing. But
effectiveness is an issue for private assistance
too. As  seen  for  the  December  2004  Asian
tsunami, private  charity  can  be  mobilized
faster than public resources. But private con-
tributions  are  inﬂuenced  by  press  coverage
more  than  actual  need; contributors  were
much  less  generous  for  the  Iranian  earth-
quake  that  hit  in  February  2005, which  was
virtually ignored in the news. Moreover, lack
of coordination, fragmentation, and  infra-
structure bottlenecks—such as bad roads and
a lack of electricity and telecommunications,
which cannot generally be alleviated through
private charity—can hinder its effectiveness.
Moreover, alignment  with  recipient  country
strategies needs to be ensured.

Transitions to greater equity
Equity-enhancing  changes  in  global  policies
and institutions come about through action by
governments and coalitions of governments—
often  within  international  fora,
informed
leadership  and  grassroots  mobilization,
analysis and policy research to inform alter-

natives, and networks that disseminate those
alternatives. This section looks at some exam-
ples illustrating the change processes; it does
not attempt to be comprehensive or to assess
the weight of individual factors.

Examples include developed-country gov-
ernments  that  take  initiative  unilaterally—
such  as  the  countries  that  have  already
reached the target of 0.7 percent of GNI for
developing assistance or that cancelled a large
portion  of the  debts  owed  to  them  by  the
poorest  countries—as  well  as  governments
acting jointly to form coalitions for change.
The  latter  are  becoming  more  frequent  in
trade negotiations, in which a group of large
developing countries (including Brazil, China,
and  India)  is  spearheading  proposals  for
greater trade liberalization.

A  way  to  spur  equity-enhancing  policy
changes by developed countries is to accom-
pany  calls  for  change  with  tracking  mecha-
nisms. The  eighth  MDG  relates  to  greater
provision  of aid  and  debt  relief and  more
equitable trade policies. Progress toward this
goal has been reviewed in September 2005 as
part of the Millennium Summit+5.

security,

Another  exercise  to  monitor  rich  coun-
try  policies, conducted  by  the  Center  for
Global  Development  and  Foreign  Policy
magazine, is the Commitment to Develop-
ment Index. The index examines more indi-
cators  than  the  eighth  MDG,
including
environment,
investment, and
technology  (Center  for  Global  Develop-
ment  2004). While  there  are  questions
about  the  methodology, particularly  on
aggregating  scores  in  various  areas, the
index exposes how some countries do better
in some areas than in others—Norway, for
instance, does  well  on  aid  but  poorly  on
trade; Switzerland  scores  poorly  on  trade
but does better on environment; the United
States  scores  poorly  on  environment  but
has, with  Canada,
the  most  favorable
migration  policies—and  how  all  countries
have considerable opportunities to improve
their policies.

Citizen  mobilization. Citizen  mobilization,
combining both grassroots and middle-class
interest groups across countries, has grown in
recent years. In some cases, an international
social  movement, network, or  alliance  has

emerged to try to inﬂuence the global agenda.
An example is the launching of the Enhanced
HIPC  Initiative  in  2000. The  original  HIPC
Initiative  beneﬁted  some  countries, but
progress  was  slow  and  there  were  several
problems. By 1999 these were largely recog-
nized, but  an  expanded  initiative  needed  to
garner  support  in  creditor  countries  and  in
the World Bank and IMF governing commit-
tees, because  it  required  additional  funding.
The Jubilee 2000 campaign, which combined
awareness of the pernicious effects of exces-
sive  debt  with  a  call  to  debt  forgiveness
inspired by the Christian Jubilee idea, mobi-
lized  hundreds  of thousands  of people  in
countries such as Germany, Italy, the United
States, and  United  Kingdom. The  govern-
ments  of these  countries  took  notice  and
ﬁnally  agreed  to  various  actions, expanding
the  HIPC  Initiative  and  canceling  bilateral
debt. Other  examples  of pressure  by  civil
society  organizations  leading  to  changes  in
rules  are  the  campaigns  to  reform  World
Bank policies on indigenous peoples, resettle-
ment, and other safeguards.

In  a  second  set  of cases, international
rules  already  exist  on  paper, and  social
movements bring them into effect by mak-
ing  them  visible  and  insisting  that  they  be
implemented. In  many  cases, this  process
happens at the country level, but it involves
an  interaction  with  global  rule  and  policy
changes. The  ethical  trade  initiatives  dis-
cussed  earlier  are  citizen  mobilizations  to
enforce  global  and  local  laws. Similarly,
efforts by indigenous movements, NGOs, and
other  activists  ensured  that  ILO  Covenant
169 on indigenous peoples was recognized
as having legal weight (in practice) in vari-
ous countries. Experience shows that citizen
mobilization  is  most  effective  when  it
builds  broad-based  coalitions  for  change
across countries and groups.

But citizen mobilization also poses risks.
Civil society movements may partly counter
unequal  formal  channels, but  they  are
highly  imperfect  mechanisms  of aggregat-
ing  voice, and  their  accountability  is  often
unclear. In  recent  years, there  have  been
instances of NGO campaigns that have led
to perverse outcomes, such as donors with-
drawing  from  infrastructure  and  resettle-
ment  projects  only  to  see  governments

Achieving greater global equity

223

move  ahead  anyway  without  international
monitoring  of social  and  environmental
consequences.

Analysis and research. Socioeconomic analy-
sis  and  policy  research  also  contribute  to
making  particular  domains  of
inequity
objects  of public  debate  and  action. Global
analysis  of gender  discrimination  and  miss-
ing  girls  and  women  (box  2.9)  has  fostered
public action to redress gender inequities. Ex
ante analysis and policy research are also vital
ingredients for informing the design of policy
proposals. A  vast  body  of recent  research,
including  serious  impact  evaluations, has
focused  on  efﬁcient  and  effective  ways  to
achieve the MDGs. The more research is con-
ducted  by  and  with  developing-country
researchers, the more likely it is that its results
will inform policymaking.

Some  of these  key  elements  have  been
missing in failed attempts at change. Analysis
and policy research is carried out and techni-
cal solutions are proposed; the political will to
implement them is missing, however, because
political  leaders  do  not  think  the  issue  is
important or coalitions are not formed that
ensure  sufﬁcient  support. In  other  cases,
grassroots mobilization is strong, but it lacks
well-developed, implementable proposals for
reform. Indeed, some NGO campaigns have
led  to  perverse  outcomes, as  when  interna-
tional organizations have withdrawn support
for  projects  under  international  criticism
only  to  see  governments  proceed  without
international monitoring of social and envi-
ronmental safeguards.

International  organizations. International
ﬁnancial  institutions  can  help  bring  about
global  equity-enhancing  action  through
setting agendas and providing a focal point
for  international  negotiations. Their  dis-
pute  settlement  and  enforcement  mecha-
nisms  help  ensure  that  their  policies  are
implemented. But  the  governance  struc-
tures of the World Bank and IMF have not
evolved in line with the increased size and
role  of emerging  market, developing, and

transition countries in the world economy.
Moreover, small and low-income countries
have a limited role in their decision-making
processes. Developed-country governments
have a majority of the votes on the boards
of the IMF and World Bank, and two execu-
tive  directors  represent  more  than  40
African countries.

Several  options  to  enhance  voice  in  the
IMF  and  World  Bank  have  been  explored,
but  limited  progress  has  been  made. In
April  2005, the  ministers  of the  intergov-
ernmental  Group  of Twenty-Four  urged
that  a  new  quota  formula  be  developed
(voting  rights  depend  on  quotas), which
would  give  greater  weight  to  measures  of
gross  domestic  product  measured  in  pur-
chasing power parity terms. They also sug-
gested that, in order to strengthen the voice
of small  and  low-income  countries, basic
votes  should  be  increased  to  restore  their
original share of total voting power.41 Mak-
ing  progress  on  enhancing  the  voice  and
participation of developing countries in the
decision-making  processes  of
the  World
Bank  and  IMF  is  of fundamental  impor-
tance to increase the legitimacy of interna-
tional  ﬁnancial  institutions  and  enhance
their effectiveness in fostering greater global
equity. The  13th  General  Review  of IMF
Quotas provides an important opportunity
to make progress on issues of quotas, voice,
and participation.

Summary
In sum, global actions can play a key role in
redressing  inequitable  rules  and  helping
equalize endowments. The rules that govern
markets for labor, goods, ideas, capital, and
the use of natural resources need to become
more  equitable. Domestic  action  to  build
the  endowments  of the  poor  can  be  sup-
ported through aid, but not if aid is poorly
spent, supports corrupt regimes, or under-
mines  domestic  accountability. Changes
will  require, above  all, greater  accounta-
bility at the global level, with greater repre-
sentation  of poor  people’s  interests  in 
rule-setting bodies.

drug access

Balancing access to medicines for the world’s poor with incentives for 
pharmaceutical innovation
What’s the best way to expand access to drugs in developing countries, while preserving incentives for pharmaceutical
research? A possible solution entails recognizing that medicine markets are far from uniform and that both the nature of
diseases and the income of countries matter for access and incentives.

Some diseases, such as malaria, mainly

affect  poor  countries, but  they  have
received  little  R&D  investment, and
few  treatments  are  available. Much  atten-
tion has been devoted in recent years to cre-
ating  the  right  incentives  and  structuring
ﬁnancing  to  increase  R&D  investment  in
drugs  for  diseases  that  affect  poor  coun-
tries, for  which  commercial  potential  does
not provide enough stimulus.1 Policy initia-
tives include the following:

•

Increasing research through public sec-
tor institutions—for example, programs
coordinated  by  the  U.S. National  Insti-
tute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,
the World Health Organization’s Special
Programme  for  Research  and  Training
in  Tropical  Diseases, and  the  nonproﬁt
Drugs  for  Neglected  Diseases  Initiative
founded by Medécins Sans Frontiérès.

• Establishing public-private partnerships,
such as the Medicines for Malaria Ven-
ture and the Malaria Vaccine Initiative,
the  International  AIDS  Vaccine  Initia-
tive, and the Global Alliance for Tuber-
culosis Drug Development.

• Designing  a  purchase  commitment  for
new vaccines (“AdvancedMarkets”). Spon-
sored  by  the  Bill  and  Melinda  Gates
Foundation, the  groundwork  has  been
laid to create markets by having donors
commit, in  advance, to  paying  part  of
the cost at a guaranteed price for a new,
as yet undiscovered, vaccine. This would
give ﬁrms an incentive to invest in this
area.2 (A similar initiative has been pro-
posed for agricultural research relevant
to developing countries.3)

• Developing an open-source approach to
early-stage  tropical  diseases  research.
The idea is to harness the expertise and
resources  of academic  scientists, stu-
dents, public  sector  researchers, and
others who may be happy to spend some
of their time doing research on tropical
diseases either for altruism or scientiﬁc

software). Leads 

curiosity (similar to what happens with
open-source 
that
emerge could then feed into any of the
other  schemes  for  the  next  stages  of
development and clinical testing.4

Providing  patent  protection  in  poor
countries for drugs primarily for their mar-
kets  would  not  by  itself provide  sufﬁcient
incentives, because their purchasing power
is  very  low. But, even  a  small  increase  in
market-based research incentives could be a
useful  part  of a  larger  strategy  to  address
the  treatment  of diseases  speciﬁc  to  the
developing world.

Other  diseases  have  global  incidence
and  worldwide  markets, and  they  are  an
important  cause  of death  and  disability
among  the  poor. In  the  high-mortality
regions of the world, cardiovascular disease
is estimated to cause a greater share of the
total disease burden than malaria and other
tropical diseases combined.5

Although  many  people  in  poor  coun-
tries suffer from global diseases, they are an
insigniﬁcant  part  of the  commercial  mar-
ket. Estimates suggest that currently almost
half of the world’s people live in countries
that  together  represent  less  than  2  percent
of global spending on drugs for cardiovas-
cular  disease.6 Because  of the  great  asym-
metries in markets, many of the poor could
be  allowed  generic  access  to  important
classes of drugs without damaging research
incentives. The foreign ﬁling license approach
described  below  is  a  feasible  way  to  attain
this outcome.

Legally binding commitments not
to enforce patent rights
The proposal considered here7 would have
inventors  in  developed  countries  make
legally binding commitments to their own
governments not to enforce patent rights in
certain  pharmaceutical  markets. These
markets would be deﬁned as those together
representing  the  bottom, say, 2  percent  of

global  drug  sales  in  each  disease  class  (see
ﬁgure below).

Along the horizontal axis of the ﬁgure are
disease classes, listed with those concentrated
in  poor  countries  toward  the  left, and  those
with  worldwide  incidence  toward  the  right.
Along the vertical axis are countries ordered
by per capita income. The white area shows
the “generic region” that would be created by
the  policy. Within  the  generic  region, ﬁrms
would  be  able  to  manufacture  and  trade  in
generic products without any political or pro-
cedural  complexity  arising  from  the  patent
system. The generic region would be recalcu-
lated  each  year  to  accommodate  changes  in
income and the evolution of markets.

Because  diseases  to  the  left  are  more
concentrated in developing countries, the 2
percent of global markets cutoff is reached
at  lower  levels  of real  GDP  per  capita. It
may  seem  counterintuitive  to  propose  dif-
ferentiating  in  this  way, but  it  is  precisely
for diseases that are concentrated in devel-
oping  countries  that  some  incentive  for
product  development  may  need  to  come
from sales in the developing world.

The poorest countries falling below the
dashed line would be allowed generics on
all pharmaceuticals. Countries higher up,
such  as  India, would  have  a  mixed  situa-
tion. They  would  be  in  the  TRIPS  envi-
ronment  for  diseases  concentrated  in  the
developing  world, while  in  the  generic
region for more global diseases. For mar-
kets in the gray area above the curved line,
the policy as no effect. Both the responsi-
bilities  and  the  flexibilities  of TRIPS
remain unchanged.

The  size  of the  generic  region  depends
on two parameters: the ceiling income level
(here  $5,000)  and, more  important, the
global sales cutoff (here 2 percent).

The proposal would be implemented by
having  inventors  in  developed  countries
make  a  legally  binding  commitment  to
their  own  governments  not  to  enforce
patent rights in the generic region, as part
of obtaining  a  license  to  make  foreign
patent  ﬁlings  (the  foreign  ﬁling  license).
Firms  would  continue  to  obtain  patents
wherever they like, and no decisions related
to the policy would be needed at the time of
applying  for  a  patent. Instead, decisions

that  relate  to  the  policy—about  where  to
enforce  patent  rights—would  arise  only
after products have reached the market. To
ensure compliance, the patent holder would
lose the right to enforce the domestic patent
on the same product if the holder were to
break  the  commitment  and  begin  an
enforcement  action  in  one  of
the  pro-
scribed markets.

Implementation  would  need  to  be
coordinated across the developed countries
that have pharmaceutical research activity,
including, at least, Canada, Europe, Japan,
and  the  United  States. The  policy  would
require  legislation  to  amend  the  patent
code in each country. In the United States
and  the  United  Kingdom  this  would
include  adding  an  inventor  declaration  to
an  existing  foreign  ﬁling  license  process;
other  countries  would  need  to  put  a  for-
eign  ﬁling  license  provision  into  their
codes.8 The classiﬁcation of countries and
disease  classes  could  be  carried  out  by  an
international  organization  and  reviewed
annually.

Developing  countries  would  not  be
required  to  take  any  action  to  implement

this  policy. They  would  continue  to  take
steps to comply with TRIPS and any bilat-
eral treaty obligations in accord with their
current plans. The countries in the generic
region could be treated as one country from
the viewpoint of patents. Production could
be  based  in  any  one  country  and  drugs
could be exported to all other countries in
that  group, without  any  costs  associated
with patents and compulsory licensing.

So, if any country in the generic region
had the ability to produce a given drug, then
all other countries in the region could take
advantage  of its  production  capacity. This
would  help  get  around  the  problem  that
most small countries do not have the capac-
ity or market size to make domestic produc-
tion of generic drugs a viable activity.

Firms have been willing to make a vol-
to  exercise
untarily  commitment  not 
patent rights in the poorest countries. The
foreign  ﬁling  license  proposal  discussed
here  would  take  that  commitment  and
convert it into a reliable part of the global
rules-based system.

Epilogue

This  report  has  argued  that  equity  has  a
central place in the interpretation of devel-
opment  experience  and  in  the  design  of
development  policy—and  that  this  place
has  been  inadequately  understood  and
undervalued in much current thinking. We
do  not  propose, however, yet  another  new
framework for development. Instead, recog-
nizing  the  importance  of equity  (that  is,
equality  of opportunity  and  the  avoidance
of absolute deprivation) implies the need to
integrate and extend existing approaches. In
this epilogue, we seek to place the analysis
and messages of the report in the context of
some of the major contemporary strands of
thinking and action in development.

Four  broad  strands  of

thinking  have
been at the core of development discourse
and  practice  over  the  last  three  decades  or
so: the  central  role  of markets  as  resource
allocation  mechanisms, the  importance  of
human  development, the  role  of institu-
tions, and a focus on empowerment.

The ﬁrst strand emphasizes the superior-
ity  of markets  over  central  planning  as
broad mechanisms to allocate resources and
determine the evolution of economic activ-
ity. This has long been understood in eco-
nomics, but there was a time when it was a
minority view among development econo-
mists.1 The situation had deﬁnitely changed
by the 1980s, as ﬁrst India and then China
moved away from planning, and the impor-
tance of incentives in determining individ-
ual behavior (as consumers, producers, and
regulators)  became  more  widely  under-
stood. The rapid and sustained growth that
followed in those two countries underlined
the point. In the 1990s, the economic tran-
sition  away  from  planning  in  the  formerly
communist  states  of Eastern  Europe  and
Central Asia dispelled any serious view that

development was possible without markets
and the private sector.

Although the resulting “Washington Con-
sensus” is  sometimes  interpreted  as  anti-
state, this  is  not  the  main  message  that
survives after more measured consideration.
Instead, just as events in the 1990s conﬁrmed
that markets were essential for development,
they also showed that good governments are
essential for well-functioning markets. Mar-
kets operate within a framework determined
by institutions, and they work only as well as
those institutions do. They work best, there-
fore, when  a  capable  state  maintains  order
within  the  rule  of law, provides  effective
regulation, macroeconomic  stability  and
other public goods, and corrects other mar-
ket failures.

The  second  strand  sees  human  develop-
ment  as  central  to  the  development  process,
through the expansion of the skills, health, and
capacity of all people to engage in social and
economic  activities  and  to  manage  the  risks
they  face. Although  the  World  Development
Report  1980  was  on  Human  Development,2
U.N. agencies—notably  the  UNDP  in  their
series  of Human  Development  Reports
(United Nations 2003)—later took the lead in
putting  these  concerns  at  the  center  of the
development  agenda. In  this, they  have  been
followed (rightly) by the whole development
community.

For  the  World  Bank, the  1990  World
Development  Report  on  Poverty3 marked
the  beginning  of a  multiyear  process  of
making  poverty  reduction  the  overarching
objective  of the  institution, building  on
these  ﬁrst  two  strands  of development
thought. The  1990  Report  argued  that
poverty  reduction  required  a  two-part
strategy—employment  creation  through
market-based  growth; and  expansion  of

226

human  capital, especially  through  broad-
based provisioning of social services.

During  the  1990s, the  third  and  fourth
strands of thought rose to prominence. The
third strand emphasized the role of “institu-
tions” in  development, building  both  on
trends  in  academic  thought  and  on  devel-
opment  practice  across  many  organiza-
tions. It reﬂected the acknowledgment that
markets, however  important, do  not  work
in a vacuum. They need rules and the insti-
tutional  enforcement  of those  rules. The
emphasis  on  institutions  took  a  variety  of
forms: a focus on the costs of corruption; a
broader concern with governance; support
for  judicial  reform; and  a  greater  practical
understanding  of
for  well-
designed, accountable, and  effective  public
regulation of privatized monopolies.

the  need 

The fourth strand sought the empower-
ment of the people for whom development
was  supposedly  taking  place. If the  central
goal  of development  is  poverty  reduction,
the  poor  should  have  a  great  deal  of voice
over  its  directions. If development  needs
markets, and  markets  need  institutions, it
should clearly matter how those institutions
are governed. If power helps determine the
outcomes  in  market  and  government  pro-
cesses  alike, the  distribution  of that  power
over the population must be important for
development. In  practical  terms, the  em-
phasis on empowerment has sought greater
participation of the poor in projects affect-
ing them, a greater preoccupation with the
political  economy  of support  for  reforms,
and  explorations  of the  role  of culture  in
development.

Several  World  Development  Reports
have sought to integrate the third and fourth
strands of thought: the 1997 Report on the
“State  in  a  Changing  World,”4 the  2002
Report  on  “Building  Institutions  for  Mar-
kets,”5 and, emblematically, the  millennial
2000/01 Report on “Attacking Poverty.”6 The
2001 Report argued that poverty reduction
required an expansion in the opportunities
of
the  poor  (notably  through  market-
oriented growth), the empowerment of the
poor, and measures that provide security for
the poor. At the World Bank, this synthesis
was crystallized in a Strategic Framework for
development, which consisted of two pillars:

building a good climate for investment and
empowering the poor.7

The ﬁrst pillar combined the strands of
thinking on the primacy of markets and on
the centrality of institutions. It argued that
only by having governance institutions that
were  at  once  effective  and  accountable
could  markets  generate  the  best  possible
results  for  investment  and  growth. This
theme was explored in the 2005 Report, “A
Better Investment Climate for Everyone.”8

The  second  pillar  was  also  a  merger  of
sorts: in seeking the empowerment of poor
people—who should be seen as the driving sub-
jects, not as passive objects of development—
it  combined  thinking  on  human  develop-
ment, institutions, and empowerment. The
2004  Report, “Making  Services  Work  for
Poor People,” explored these themes in the
delivery of basic services.9

Although the various elements of think-
ing  and  policy  are  complementary—and
indeed have been considered elements of a
“comprehensive” or “holistic” development
process—the narratives associated with the
different  strands  have  often  suffered,
in
practice, from  two  important  limitations.
One  is  a  tendency  to  compartmentalize
poverty. The second is to treat actions in the
various  realms  as  separate. There  is  a  ten-
dency to assign market-related and macro-
policies  to  macroeconomic  managers  and
trade ministries, as though the “investment
climate” concerned  only  rich  people  or  as
though the poor stood to beneﬁt only indi-
rectly  from  the  trickle-down  effects  of the
investments by the rich today.

Conversely,

it  sometimes  seems  as
though  empowerment  would  have  no
impact on the quality of institutions, on the
investment opportunities of the poor, or on
the economy’s growth process. According to
this view, empowerment should be the pre-
serve  of well-meaning  NGOs  and  social
development  folk, of little  import  for  eco-
nomic performance.

Such a separation of the two pillars—for the
investment  climate  and  for  empowerment—
is  profoundly  misguided. The  analysis  in
this report suggests that the root causes of
poverty  are  to  be  found  in  the  combined
deprivations  of power  and 
investment
lack  of
opportunities. Lack  of

incomes,

access  to  services,
lack  of assets—these
deprivations go together with lack of voice,
lack of power, lack of status. Public action
could enhance  the  investment  capabilities
of those who have limited opportunities by
investing in their human capital and in the
infrastructure  they  use  and  by  ensuring
fairness  and  security  in  the  markets  in
which  they  transact. And  if public  action
fails to do that, it is because it somehow has
been  decided  otherwise. In  that  case, the
government  will

schools or universities, rather than in those
used  by  the  poor, for  example. It  will  not
enforce  tax  collection, rather  than  build
rural roads. It will allow banks to retain a
degree  of market  power  and  lend  to  the
friends  of
the  government, rather  than
allow  for  entry  and  promote  competition

est  returns  on  capital. Observed  policies

the result of political choices, implicitly or
explicitly.

invest 

Such failures in public action, which arise
from  and  perpetuate  inequity, are  also
inimical  to  prosperity. Those  who  have  no
opportunities  cannot  contribute  to  the
development of their countries. Their poten-
tial talents are wasted, and capital, land, and
other  resources  are  used  in  inferior  ways.
Unequal  control  over  resources  reinforces
the unequal concentration of power, and this
is reﬂected in worse governance institutions:
public  service  delivery  agencies  are  not
pushed  to  become  more  accountable. If all
the  power  brought  to  bear  on  regulators  is
that of the friends of the regulated, the qual-
ity  of regulatory  agencies  is  not  likely  to
improve much. Police forces and judicial sys-
tems  will  not  treat  everyone  the  same  way.
And so on. These institutional failures only
add  to  the  negative  effects  of inequity  on
development.

Government policies are what they are—
from  Mali  to  Chile—because  someone  is
making them. No group is powerless, unless
some  other  group

lead  to  changes  in  that  distribution  over
time. And  if power  is  imbalanced,
it  is
because wealth and economic opportunities
are uneven. Inequality traps are vicious cir-
cles, with  economic  and  political  inequali-
ties mutually reinforcing one another.

This  report  has  argued  that  policy  and
institutional  reforms  can  help  break  these
inequality traps, and turn the vicious circles
into a virtuous process of greater equality in
economic opportunities reinforcing greater
political  equality, and  vice  versa. Reforms
can do this in many ways, which are closely
related to the four strands of thinking dis-
cussed  above.
Interventions  that  build
greater human capacities for those with the
most  limited  opportunities  (generally  the
poor)  will  prepare  them  to  be  more  eco-
nomically  productive  and  more  politically
effective. Processes  that  redistribute  access
to  land, or  to  infrastructure  services, or
indeed to justice, can add both to empower-
ment  and  to  the  investment  opportunities
of the  poor. And  promoting  fairness  in
markets  is  all  about  improvements  in  the
quality  of
institutions  that  support  and
complement markets in ways that broaden
access and ensure equitable rules.

This is consistent with the twin pillars of
a  better  investment  climate  and  greater
empowerment for the poor. It makes it clear
that—for  most  people  in  the  developing
world, and certainly for the poor—it is not
possible  to  have  one  without  the  other. A
good investment climate is about real eco-
nomic opportunities. Equity is about level-
ing  the  playing  ﬁeld  so  that  opportunities
are  available  on  the  basis  of talent  and
efforts, rather  than  on  the  basis  of gender,
race, family background, or other predeter-
mined  circumstances. A  level  economic
playing  ﬁeld  is  not  sustainable  without  a
level political playing ﬁeld, and vice versa. If
we  want  a  better  investment  climate  for
everyone, we  want  empowerment. The
combination of both implies equity.

These issues apply with equal force at the
global level. The extraordinary inequalities
in opportunity faced by individuals born in
different countries reﬂect different political
and  economic  histories  across  nations.
While domestic policy is undoubtedly fun-
damental, global  interactions  help  shape

Epilogue

the  context  for  national  economic  and
social  advance. The  Monterrey  Consensus
explicitly  emphasizes  the  need  for  a  com-
pact between rich and poor societies if the
Millennium  Development  Goals  are  to  be
achieved. It recognizes the role of action by
rich countries, especially in the areas of aid
and  trade. For  aid, this  is  reﬂected  in  the
quest  to  change  the  donor-recipient  rela-
tionship from one of giving to one of part-
nership, with  developing  countries  clearly
in  the  lead  in  designing  their  policies  and
institutions.

This report underlines the importance of
that  compact  and  a  more  equal  interna-

tional  partnership. But  it  also  highlights
inequalities  in  the  processes  forming  the
rules of the game in the international play-
ing  ﬁeld. Inequalities  in  economic  and
political power in the global arena inﬂuence
the  design  of rules  in  ways  that  often
restrict, rather than expand, the opportuni-
ties  of poorer  countries—and, even  more,
of poorer  groups  within  these  countries.
Just  as  in  the  domestic  context, therefore,
equity  and  efﬁciency  in  the  international
arena  are  more  likely  to  be  attained  by  re-
forms that enhance the power and broaden
the economic access of the countries where
the world’s poor live.

Overview

1. The  infant  mortality  rates  are  computed  separately  at  the
province level only, and do not take into account racial, gender, or
other  social  differences. The  life  expectancy  statistics  are  for  race
and gender groups, and do not take regional or income differences
into account. The real differences between typical individuals with
the  listed  characteristics  are  therefore  likely  to  be  understated. In
addition, Nthabiseng’s life expectancy could be much lower if she
were to become infected with HIV/AIDS, as are many young South
African  women. Data  come  from  Day  and  Hedberg  (2004). Pre-
dicted  years  of schooling  rely  on  disaggregated  information—by
province, sex, race, rural-urban location, consumption expenditure
quintile, and  mother’s  education—from  the  Labor  Force  Survey
and the Income and Expenditure Survey for 2000, which were car-
ried out by the South Africa Statistics Ofﬁce.

2. Predicted  monthly  consumption  expenditures  in  2000  for
persons with those characteristics were Rand 119 ($45 adjusted for
purchasing power parity) for Nthabiseng and Rand 3,662 ($1,370)
for Pieter. The average white male with a highly educated mother,
who lives in Cape Town and is in the top 20 percent of the distribu-
tion, happens  to  be  in  the  ninety-ninth  percentile  of the  overall
income distribution. Data come from the Labor Force Survey and
the Income and Expenditure Survey for 2000.

3. There are also income, consumption, and other differences:
Sven  can  expect  to  earn  $833  a  month  compared  with  the  South
African mean of $207 (Nthabiseng will have $44 a month). If Sven
had been even luckier, and had been born at the same rank in Swe-
den’s  income  distribution  as  Pieter  occupied  in  South  Africa, his
expected monthly earnings would climb to $2,203. Sven will be able
to visit any country on a whim, whereas Nthabiseng and Pieter can
expect to spend hours waiting for a visa, which they may or may
not obtain.

4. In some cases, such as China’s decollectivization of agricul-
ture in the late 1970s, a reform may lead to more efﬁciency, broader
opportunities, and  yet  greater  (intrarural)  income  inequality.
China’s experience—and the decompression of wages in a number
of transition  economies  in  Europe  and  Central  Asia—is  a  good
illustration  of a  more  general  point: because  equity  refers  to  fair
processes  and  equal  opportunities, it  cannot  be  inferred  from
income distributions alone. Greater fairness will generally lead to
lower income inequality, but not always. And not all policies that
reduce inequality increase equity.

5. Mazumder (2005).
6. Other interactions between unequal opportunities and social
conditions  are  also  of societal  concern, including  links  between
inequality  and  crime, and  between  inequality  and  health. We

review them brieﬂy in the report, but focus on the channels of more
direct signiﬁcance to equity.

7. There may be many sound economic reasons for these risk-
adjusted interest rates to vary, including ﬁxed administrative loan
costs, greater informational asymmetries, and the like. The point is
that  this  affects  poorer  groups  more, in  ways  unrelated  to  their
investment opportunities, thus leading to both greater inefﬁciency
and the perpetuation of inequalities.

8. These averages are based on actual episodes and refer to the
total  growth  elasticity  of poverty  reduction,
inclusive  of any
changes in inequality. “Low” and “high” inequality refers to a Gini
coefﬁcient  of 0.3  and  0.6  respectively. The  partial  elasticity  of
poverty to growth, assuming no change in the Lorenz curve, shows
a similar decline, but not to zero (see chapter 4).

9. While  equity-enhancing  redistribution  will  usually  be  from
richer groups to poorer groups, it could happen that “good” redis-
tributions will be to groups that are not poor, especially those in the
middle. This will depend on the nature of the market failure. For
example, the initial beneﬁciaries of a less-captured ﬁnancial system
may be small and medium entrepreneurs. Beneﬁts to the poor will
occur  when  enhanced  access  to  ﬁnancial  services  among  middle-
class entrepreneurs translates into faster growth and job creation.

12. “Too much” and “too little” are used here with respect to the

social optimum. The choices are usually privately rational.

13. The role of high inequality of political power and wealth as a
barrier  to  economic  development  in  the  modern  era  is  a  rapidly
growing area of research. Striking results are reported in Sokoloff
and Khan (1990), Engerman and Sokoloff (1997, 2002), Acemoglu,
Johnson, and  Robinson  (2001, 2002), and  Banerjee  and  others
(2001). Overviews of the broad set of research questions are Enger-
man  and  Sokoloff (2002), Hoff (2003), and  Acemoglu, Johnson,
and Robinson (2004).

14. This  is  so  if the  distribution  of talents  and  informational
asymmetries  between  employers  and  employees  are  similar
between men and women. Notice that the efﬁciency gain does not
satisfy  the  Pareto  criterion. Some  individual  men  might  lose  out.
The  efﬁciency  criterion  here  is  ﬁrst-order  dominance, under  the
anonymity axiom.

15. Of course, the  intrinsic  valuation  of equity  may  be
reflected in the appropriate distributional weights underpinning
these benefits.

16. This has been a recurrent theme in development economics
and  at  the  World  Bank. For  an  inﬂuential  early  treatment, see

(2002), both  of which  rely  on  the  Barro  and  Lee  (2001)  interna-

11. These  correlations  hold  whether  or  not  between-group
inequality is measured on the basis of the conventional or alterna-
tive  methodology. They  also  hold  after  controlling  for  outliers
(although South Africa is a particularly inﬂuential observation in
the regression of inequality on social group differences). The results
also hold when all the between-group shares are combined into a
single-count  indicator  that  reﬂects  whether  a  particular  country

has a higher-than-median value of the between-group share for a
particular population breakdown.

their implications.

15. Deaton  and  Drèze  (2002), Sen  and  Himanshu  (2004)  and
Banerjee and Piketty (2003) all document increases in inequality,
but by varying amounts. These estimates are all predicated on cer-
tain assumptions given the fundamental problems of data compa-
rability referred to above.

gender discrimination and development, although the core idea has
a long intellectual history in social science.

30. It is also important to note that the appearance of “internaliz-
ing disadvantage” (for example, working slowly, being tardy) can actu-
ally be a covert strategy used by marginalized groups to subvert sys-
tems over which they otherwise have little inﬂuence. See Scott (1986).
31. If income  inequality, a  static  measure, is  a  good  proxy  for
social mobility, a dynamic concept, then these theories ﬁnd support
in  the  large  literature  on  income  inequality  and  crime. See, for
example, Demombynes  and  Özler  (2005)  for  a  discussion  of the
subject at the country level, and Fajnzylber, Lederman, and Loayza

subject of controversy (see e.g., Klasen 2005).

just  exist  between  rich  and  poor  countries, or  between  different
groups of citizens in poor countries only. In 2002, the median age at
death in Australia for indigenous people was roughly 20 years less
than  that  for  nonindigenous  males, which  was  approximately  76
years (Australian Bureau of Statistics 2003).

27, 2000, 94. “There is plenty of evidence that current patterns of
growth and globalization are widening income disparities.” Policy
Director of Oxfam, letter to The Economist, June 20, 2000, 6.

5. Doing this in practice requires household survey data and var-
ious adjustments and assumptions—all far from simple—which is
why so many people discuss international or intercountry inequality
using National Accounts data instead of global inequality.

6. Pritchett (1997).
7. It  is  important  to  note  that  all  the  evidence  presented  here
refer to intercountry or international inequality in life expectancy at
birth, and not to global inequalities, because we do not use any evi-
dence on within-country differences in life expectancy.

8. Goesling and Firebaugh (2004).
9. Note that the declines in life expectancy for the mainly Sub-
Saharan  African  countries  do  not  seem  to  be  a  direct  result  of
changes  in  infant  mortality, which  in  many  cases  continued  to
decline. However, as Cornia and Menchini (2005) argue, the rate of
decline in infant mortality also slowed down signiﬁcantly in the last
decade, which cannot be explained solely by the changes in Europe
and Central Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa.

the 1980s.

17. The  increase  in  inequality  between  countries  in  life
expectancy at birth in the 1990s is also conﬁrmed by Goesling and
Firebaugh (2004).

18. A recent paper by Brainerd and Cuttler (2004) cites increased
alcohol use and psychosocial stress brought on by an unpredictable

in Russia and other countries of the former Soviet Union.

19. This  ﬁgure  in  Morocco  compares  with  roughly  three-

reader should bear in mind the discussion on the comparability of
these data from box 2.5 and not interpret these differences literally.
21. The urban and rural ﬁgures for China (and India) have not
been corrected for cost-of-living differences. Given that rural-urban
price differentials have been increasing over time and are signiﬁcant
today (Chen and Ravallion 2004), the ﬁgures here exaggerate the dif-
ferences in living standards between the rural and urban Chinese.

absolute one.

Development  Goals  do  not  give  one  cause  for  greater  optimism.
East Asia and Europe and Central Asia are close to the target on pri-
mary education, while others are falling behind. A handful of coun-
tries are on track to attain the child mortality goal, mainly in Latin
America  and  the  Caribbean. Only  21  percent  of the  developing
world’s  population  is  expected  to  achieve  the  maternal  mortality
goal. Halving the proportion of people without access to safe water
and sanitation will require providing about 1.5 billion people with
access  to  safe  water  and  2  billion  with  basic  sanitation  facilities
between 2000 and 2015. At current rates of service expansion, only
about one-ﬁfth of countries are on track. See http://www.un.org/

Part II

1. In his second inaugural address, Roosevelt also suggested that
avoiding deprivation in outcomes was a legitimate policy aim. As he
put it, “The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the
abundance  of those  who  have  much; it  is  whether  we  provide
enough for those who have too little” (Washington, DC, January 20,
1937). There  tends  to  be  less  agreement  on  the  importance  of
inequality  in  speciﬁc  outcome  spaces. Writing  about  income
inequality, Feldstein  (1998)  argues  that  increases  in  inequality
caused by larger incomes at the very top warrant no policy atten-
tion, and  represent  “pure  Pareto  improvements,” to  which  only
“spiteful egalitarians” would object.

3. As  chapter  1  also  indicated, this  is  not equivalent  to  saying
that implementing redistributions is free of tradeoffs, particularly
in the short run, or that terrible inefﬁciencies cannot arise if redis-
tributions are implemented in ways that pay no heed to incentives.
We return to these difﬁcult policy issues in chapters 7, 8, and 9.

3. The reason for this reputation is the combination of a utilitar-
ian  objective  with  a  set  of (rather  restrictive)  assumptions  about
individual utilities: (i) individual preferences can be represented by
a utility function; (ii) cardinal utility levels are meaningful indica-
tors  of the  individual’s  well-being; (iii)  utilities  can  be  compared
across different people; (iv) the utility functions are increasing but
concave (that is, increase at a declining rate) in incomes; and (v) all
individuals have identical utility functions. If they all hold, then, for
a  ﬁxed  level  of aggregate  income, the  greatest  sum  of utilities  is
achieved by an equal division of incomes across all individuals.

4. Sen (2000), 69.
5. For example, within German Courts, the standard of what is
equitable is based on “the opinion of all those people who think in
equitable and just terms”(Palandt 2004, article 242).

6. For example, within common law jurisdictions, key principles
that  guide  the  application  of equity  include  the  principles  of
“unconscionability,” “undue  inﬂuence,” “duress,” and  “unjust
enrichment.” A  transaction  has  been  deemed  unconscionable
where “one  party  to  a  transaction  is  at  a  special  disadvantage  in
dealing  with  the  other  party  because  illness, ignorance, inexperi-
ence, impaired  faculties, ﬁnancial  need, or  other  circumstances
affect his ability to conserve his own interests, and the other party
unconscientiously takes advantage of the opportunity thus placed
in  his  hands” (High  Court  of Australia, Blomley  v. Ryan 1956, 99
CLR 362 at p. 415, per Kitto J.).

9. The Chancellory Courts have their origin in the residual dis-
cretionary power of the King, generally exercised by the Chancellor,

to correct or overturn cases in which justice could not be obtained
by a common law court.

10. In the common law tradition, equitable jurisdiction is also
associated with a number of well-established principles, sometimes
called the “maxims of equity.” Examples of these include: He who
seeks equity must do equity—that is, a claimant who seeks equitable
relief must be prepared to act fairly toward the defendant (future
conduct); He  who  comes  to  equity  must  come  with  clean  hands—
similar to the previous principle, but related to the claimant’s past
conduct; Equity  looks  at  intent  rather  than  form—equity  is  more
concerned with substance than form.

and  encouraging  respect  for  human  rights  and  for  fundamental
freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language or reli-
gion” Article 2(1)—“sovereign equality of all members”—indicates
balance between the principles of sovereignty and noninterference
and of respect for human rights; Article 55—“universal respect for,
and observance of human rights.” Other references to human rights
include Articles 13(b)(1), 62(2), and 68.

laration (UNGA) (A/CONF. 157/23), July 12, 1993. This was issued

June 14–25, 1993.

16. Rights  identiﬁed  in  the  UDHR  include  the  right “without
any discrimination to equal protection before the law” (Article 7),
the right to “take part in the government of his country, directly or
through freely chosen representatives” (Article 21), and the right to
education (Article 26).

17. There  exist  several  different  characterizations  of the  “core
human  rights  treaties.” One  is  the  “International  Bill  of Rights,”
which  comprises  the  Universal  Declaration  on  Human  Rights, the
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the Inter-
national Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Another
conceptualization is that there are six major human rights treaties:
the ICCPR (1966), the ICESCR (1966), the Convention on the Elim-
ination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD) (1964), the
Convention  on  the  Elimination  of All  Forms  of Discrimination
Against Women (CEDAW) (1989), the Convention Against Torture
(CAT) (1984) and the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC)
(1989). None of these characterizations should be taken as exhaustive
or  exclusive; there  are  several  other  extremely  important  human
rights treaties beyond these, both within the U.N. system and outside
it  in  regional  systems. The  OHCHR  lists “seven  core  international
human  rights  instruments”: the  six  above, plus  the  International
Convention on the Protection of the Rights of Migrant Workers and
the Members of their Families (1990). In addition to this, mention
should also be made of the Genocide Convention (1948).

18. Henrich  and  others  (2004)  report  on  Ultimatum  Games
played in 15 small-scale societies around the world. In an Indone-
sian experiment, Cameron (1999) found that high offers persisted
in games played with (locally) very high monetary stakes.

19. See, for  instance, Fehr  and  Schmidt  (1999)  on  a  theory  of
“inequity aversion,” and Rabin (1993) on a model of behavior that
takes other people’s intentions directly into account.

vey, which was ﬁelded every year between 1972 and 1997. A similar

used in the study.

23. Subjective  well-being—or  “happiness”—surveys  have  also
been used to test the relative income hypothesis in a number of dif-
ferent  settings. Following  on  original  work  by  Easterlin  (1974),
which suggested that, despite sustained economic growth, people in
some  rich  countries  were  not  growing  any  happier, a  number  of
recent studies have found that reported well-being rises with per-
sonal  income, but  declines  with  the  income  of other  people  in  a
person’s reference group. This is usually interpreted to mean that
well-being is driven at least in part by relative incomes, rather than
purely by their absolute levels. See Graham and Felton (2005) for
Latin America, Ravallion and Lokshin (2002) for the Russian Fed-
eration, and  Luttmer  (2004)  for  the  United  States. The  relative
income literature is of tangential interest for this report, because it
provides additional backing for the idea that one’s position in soci-
ety in relation to others matters, both for individual behavior and
for welfare.

29. Using a slightly different dataset, and a decomposition tech-
nique that also accounts for the differential sensitivity of different
poverty measures to changes in mean incomes, Kraay (forthcom-
ing) ﬁnds that the growth share in this variance is closer to 70 per-
cent. In a sample of long spells only, that share rises to 94 percent.
30. Whereas  the  total  growth  elasticity  of poverty  reduction
simply  relates  total  change  in  poverty  to  the  growth  in  mean
incomes, without  controlling  for  changes  in  the  relative  distribu-
tion and is therefore given by

WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2006

This deﬁnition, like the decomposition on which it is based, is path-
dependent, and the elasticity would be somewhat different if it was
calculated on the basis of the ﬁnal-period Lorenz curve, rather than
the initial one. In this report, we always use the initial period rela-
tive  distribution  when  computing  partial  growth  elasticities. No
regression  method  is  used, so  no  functional  form  of any  kind  is
imposed on the relationship.

31. This ﬁnding is qualitatively consistent with alternative esti-
mates of the relationship between partial and total growth elastici-
ties, on  the  one  hand, and  income  inequality, on  the  other. See
Bourguignon (2003) and Ravallion (2005).

32. The other four combinations of poverty lines and measures
were  also  computed, and  the  upward-sloping  pattern  is  qualita-
tively robust.

33. See  also  Bourguignon, Ferreira, and  Lustig  (2004)  for  a

detailed discussion of seven country studies.

34. In fact, World Bank (2005b) ﬁnds that, on average, the poor-
est  20  percent  of the  population  in  each  of 14  countries  in  their
study grow 0.7 percent for each 1 percentage point growth in mean
incomes.

Chapter 5

1. See, for example, Fisman (2001a).
2. Even in a hypothetical world with perfectly functioning mar-
kets, there may still be an indirect inﬂuence, coming from the effect
of wealth or income on savings decisions. It has been suggested that
the  poor  are  less  inclined  to  save  than  the  rich, and  as  a  result,
aggregate savings as a proportion of aggregate income may go up if
the rich gain at the expense of the poor. This could affect invest-
ment decisions through the effect of the supply of savings on the
price  of capital. Inequality, in  this  Kaldorian  view  of the  world
(after Nicholas Kaldor, the Cambridge economist), would enhance
growth, although it might yet be a Pyrrhic victory. Kaldor worried
about the inevitability of crises under capitalism, and he saw faster
growth  accompanied  by  burgeoning  inequality  as  a  recipe  for
ongoing crises.

3. Note that such redistributions from wealthier to poorer peo-
ple do not necessarily have to be to the poorest people in society,
but rather to those with good growth opportunities.

17. The ICOR measures the increase in output predicted by a
one-unit increase in capital stock. It is calculated by extrapolating
from the past experience of the country and assumes that the next
unit of capital will be used exactly as efﬁciently (or inefﬁciently) as
the previous one. The inverse of the ICOR therefore gives an upper
bound for the average marginal product for the economy—it is an
upper bound because the calculation of the ICOR does not control
for  the  effect  of the  increases  in  the  other  factors  of production,
which  also  contributes  to  the  increase  in  output. The  implicit
assumption  that  the  other  factors  of production  are  growing  is
probably reasonable for most developing countries, except perhaps
in Africa.

23. Some of the effects of lack of insurance may be quite subtle.
Banerjee  and  Newman  (1991)  argue, for  example, that  the  avail-
ability of insurance in one location (the village) and its unavailabil-
ity in another (the city) may lead to inefﬁcient migration decisions,
because some individuals with high potential in the city may prefer
to stay in the village to remain insured.

24. The fact that there is underinvestment on average, and not
only a set of people with too many bullocks and a set of people with
too few, is probably due to the fact that bullocks are a lumpy invest-
ment, and  owning  more  than  two  is  inefﬁcient  for  production
(there is no small adjustment possible at the margin).

25. Another piece of relevant evidence comes from the effects of
titling nonagricultural land. Field (2003) shows evidence from a land-
titling program in the slums of urban Peru that suggests that the lack
of a clear title to the land where you have built your home reduces the
ability of the household members to work outside. Field hypothesizes
that this is because someone needs to be home to defend the untitled
property from expropriation by others. But she does not ﬁnd any evi-
dence that land titling improves access to credit.

26. This number takes into account the fact that only 20 percent
of the Indonesian population is iron deﬁcient. The private returns
of iron  supplementation  for  someone  who  knew  they  were  iron
deﬁcient—which  they  can  ﬁnd  out  using  a  simple  ﬁnger  prick—
would be $200.

2. Using data from van der Eng (1993a, 1993b, 2002), it is possi-
ble to construct an index of pro-poor growth from 1880 to 1990
(Timmer 2005). Using this index, the rates of pro-poor growth for
each historical era were as follows: 1880–1905 = 0.05 percent per
year; 1905–1925 = 4.57 percent per year; 1925–1950 = –2.57 per-
cent per year; 1950–1965 = 2.37 percent per year; and 1965–1990 =
6.56 percent per year.

3. All  Indonesian  distributional  data  are  subject  to  the  usual
caveats about the difﬁculty of obtaining adequate responses from
both the very poor and the very rich. In particular, SUSENAS does
not  capture  the  extremely  uneven  accumulation  of wealth  or  the
conspicuous consumption of the ultra rich.

4. There is a “standard” economic model behind this story, in
which  the  capital  of individuals—formal  and  informal  skills,
land, location, and  even  accumulated  savings—is  deployed  to
earn  incomes, with  the  possibilities  determined  by  technology,
transactions  costs, and  market  prices. See  Alatas  and  Bour-
guignon (2004).

large scale in the Chicago public schools; the Abecedarian program,
a  full-day  year-round  education  program  in  Chapel  Hill, North
Carolina, with  followup  to  age  21; and  the  High/Scope  Perry
Preschool, a  half-day  program  on  a  small  scale  in  the  Ypsilanti,
Michigan, public schools with follow up to age 40. The last two are
small  randomized  experiments. Studies  on  the  Chicago  program
use statistical techniques to control for selection bias and other fac-
tors that might confound interpretation of results.

18. Currie and Thomas (1995) ﬁnd that gains in vocabulary and
reading  test  scores  faded  out  among  black  Head  Start  children
while  they  were  still  in  elementary  grades  but  not  among  whites
even  though  initial  gains  in  test  scores  were  the  same  for  both
groups. Currie  and  Thomas  (2000)  attribute  this  to  their  ﬁnding
that black children who attended Head Start go on to attend lower-
quality schools than other black children but that the same is not
true for whites.

(Bruns, Mingat, and Rakotomalala 2003 and FTI Secretariat 2004).
22. See  Wodon  (2005)  for  Niger  and  Senegal—in  Senegal,
when the school is located less than 15 minutes away from home,
the probability of enrollment for boys goes up by 30 percentage
points as compared with having the school more than one hour
away. Burney and Irfan (1995) found negligible impacts of prox-
imity.

23. The study ﬁnds that children age two to four, in 1974, had an
additional  0.12  to  0.19  years  of education  and  1.5  to  2.7  percent
higher wages for each new school built per 1,000 children (Duﬂo
2001). Other studies that ﬁnd positive impacts of expanding school
infrastructure  include  Birdsall  (1985)  in  urban  Brazil, DeTray
(1988)  and  Lillard  and  Willis  (1994)  in  Malaysia, Lavy  (1996)  in

26. In  Brazil  in  2001, the  Bolsa  Escola  program  was  spending
almost $700 million a year and reaching 8.6 million school children,
one-third of all primary school children in Brazil. In Bangladesh, the
Food for Education budget in 2000 was $77 million, beneﬁting 2.2
million children, 13 percent of total school enrollment (Morley and
Coady 2003). In Mexico, according to government ﬁgures, by 2004,
Opportunidades was spending approximately $2.3 billion annually,
or about 1.5 percent of total expenditture, and reaching 5 million
households—almost 20  percent of all families in Mexico.

36. It is also important to take account of household behavior in
response to changes in school inputs. Das, Dercon, Habrayimana,
and Krishnan (2004) ﬁnd that household spending and (nonsalary)
cash grants to schools are close substitutes with no impact on learn-
ing  from  anticipated  increases  in  school  funds. Unanticipated
funds have signiﬁcant learning impacts.

39. The  analysis  is  not  able  to  separate  the  effects  of private
schools from the effects of the incentives for greater effort gener-
ated  by  the  voucher  policy. The  distinction  is  important  because
effort can be encouraged also by awarding scholarships to students
attending public schools, as we saw with the Balshaki program. See
Angrist and others (2002).

tion from school choice in North Carolina improved test scores sig-
niﬁcantly. Cullen, Jacob, and Levitt (2000) and Cullen, Jacob, and
Levitt (2003) found no impact from school choice in Chicago. See
also Witte (2000). Hoxby (2000) ﬁnds signiﬁcant productivity gains
for  a  representative  sample  across  the  United  States, while  Roth-
stein (2005) uses the same data to ﬁnd far more modest results.

47. Wößmann  (2004)  argues  for  giving  decision-making
authority to those with the most relevant information and the low-
est prospects for personal gain. He ﬁnds that student performance
improves  with  central  control  over  the  curriculum, budget, and
exams; delegation of process and personnel decisions to the school;
greater  say  for  teachers  in  the  selection  of appropriate  teaching
methods; regular scrutiny of students’ education performance; and
parental  interest  in  education  content. Competition  from  private
education institutions and the presence of teacher unions, on the
other hand, have adverse effects.

lies were able to self-insure reasonably well the costs of minor ill-
ness  (up  to  70  percent  of the  income  loss  associated  with  these),
they were able to insure only 38 percent of the income loss associ-
ated with illness that severely limits physical functioning.

65. Uganda’s use rates had dipped with the introduction of fees
in  the  1990s, and  although  Uganda’s  poor  were  formally  exempt,
they  often  paid  as  much  as  other  users. Deininger  and  Mpuga
(2004) estimate that the revenues lost to the health system from the
elimination of user fees in 2001 were smaller than the value of ben-
eﬁts from the reduction in foregone earnings, thanks to a healthier
population.

74. Improved  access  to  credit  is  reported  for  South  Africa
(Ardington and Lund 1995) and Brazil (Schwarzer and Querino
2002), where the electronic banking card issued by the program
is often used as proof of creditworthiness. A significant share of
rural pension beneficiaries in Brazil report using part of the pen-
sion to purchase seeds and agricultural tools (Delgado and Car-
doso Jr. 2000); others report investing in improvements in their
housing. Children  and  older  people  in  beneficiary  households
had  better  health  in  South  Africa  (Case  2001)  and  enrollment
rates of school-age children were higher among pension benefi-
ciary  households  in  both  South Africa  (Duflo  2003)  and  Brazil
(de Carvalho Filho 2000).

investing  state  power  in  one  person  or  group, with  each  branch
holding the others accountable through differing “checks and bal-
ances.” This  system  also  arguably  maintains  competition  within

and traditions have been deﬁned as informal, traditional, or cus-
tomary law, all existing within vastly differing contexts. The use of
“informal” is used in contrast to “formal” state systems and is not
meant to imply that such institutions are procedurally informal.

employment  in  agricultural  wage  labor  (as  opposed  to  self-
employed cultivation) is strongly correlated with poverty (Kijima
and  Lanjouw  2004). Similarly, in  Thailand, controlling  for  other

factors, tenancy increases the risk of poverty by nearly 30 percent
compared with being a landowner (World Bank 2001f).

48. Building on spontaneous transactions in which either the
tenant or landlord buys out the other party’s interest, the govern-
ment is considering ways to facilitate such buyouts in a more sys-
tematic  and  equitable  fashion, thereby  allowing  one  party  to
obtain  full  ownership  rights  to  the  land  (Nielsen  and  Hanstad
2004).

(2002). Some  studies  report  a  doubling  of investment  and  large
gains  in  land  values  (30–80  percent)  with  more  secure  tenure
(World Bank 2003i). To the extent that highly visible investments,
such as trees or fences, may be a means to establish landownership
rights, causality might run the other way (Brasselle, Gaspart, and
Platteau  2002). A  recent  study  from  Ethiopia  demonstrates  that
tenure insecurity indeed encourages investment in trees that have
little impact on productivity, while higher levels of tenure security
are unambiguously associated with productivity-enhancing invest-
ments (Deininger and others 2003).

live (either on the occupied plot or an alternative should relocation
be necessary); (2) a 30-year lease transferable in the event of death;
and  (3)  a  199-year  lease  effectively  conferring  ownership  rights
upon survey and payment for the land.

59. Land  regulation  can  also  work  against  the  urban  poor.
When  formal  land  development  parameters  (such  as  minimum
plot sizes, setbacks, and infrastructure servicing standards) are not
benchmarked  against  affordability  levels  for  the  majority  of the
urban  population, the  poor  are  excluded  from  access  to  formal
landownership. Bertaud  and  Malpezzi  (2001), Payne  and  Majale

63. Historically, distress  sales  have  played  a  major  role  in  the
accumulation  of land  by  large  manorial  estates  in  China  (Shih
1992)  and  in  early  Japan  (Takeoshi  1967)  and  by  large  landlord
estates in Punjab (Hamid 1983). The abolition of communal tenure
and  the  associated  loss  of mechanisms  for  diversifying  risk  are
among  the  factors  underlying  the  emergence  of large  estates  in
Central America (Brockett 1984).

an economic perspective because they are compatible with incen-
tives for effort and investment but various imperfections in mar-
kets make these rare (chapter 5).

69. In  most  states, lack  of political  support  for  the  legislation
allowed landlords to subvert the intent of the laws. West Bengal is
an exception—a tenant registration campaign had strong political
support and succeeded in protecting tenants (Appu 1997).

areas  of good  agricultural  potential, but  with  poor  market
access, while  only  23  percent  live  in  areas  of good  agricultural
potential  and  good  market  access. The  remainder  have  both
poor market access and poor agricultural potential (Byerlee and

80. Economies from large production and delivery have dimin-
ished in some activities, especially telecommunications and power
generation. And regulatory innovation made unbundling possible.
Unbundling  promoted  competition  by  separating  activities  in
which  economies  of scale  are  important  (for  example, electricity
transmission and distribution) from activities in which it is less so
(electricity  generation). See  World  Bank  (1994)  and  World  Bank

21. For  discussions  of India’s  labor  market  regulation  and  its
adverse  effects, see  Stern  (2002), Hasan, Mitra, and  Ramaswamy
(2003), and Besley and Burgess (2004). For example, industrial sec-
tor legislation requires employers with more than 100 workers to
seek prior approval of the government before dismissing workers.
This has earned the country a 90 out of 100 on the World Bank’s
Doing  Business  in  2005 “difﬁculty  in  ﬁring  index” (World  Bank
(2005e).

22. See Kingdon, Sandefur, and Teal (2005). Strict enforcement
of
labor  market  regulations  in  South  Africa—even  for  small
ﬁrms—can  also  contribute  to  unemployment  by  inhibiting  the
development of informal sector ﬁrms.

23. In  1997–98, 83  percent  of nonagricultural  employment  in

India was informal (ILO 2002).

29. The unemployment ﬁgure relies on the broad deﬁnition of the
labor force (employed + searching and nonsearching unemployed).
Using the strict labor force measure (employed + searching unem-
ployed), the  unemployment  rate  was  32  percent  in  2003. Data  is
from the 2003 Labor Force Survey cited by Kingdon, Sandefur, and
Teal  (2005). “The  ratio  of non-agricultural  informal  sector  em-
ployment to unemployment is 0.7 in South Africa but 4.7 in Sub-
Saharan Africa, 7.0  in  Latin America  and  ll.9  in Asia.” (Kingdon,
Sandefur, and Teal 2005).

30. Estimates  suggest  high  levels  of unemployment  (20  to  30
percent for urban males), but there are measurement problems that
bias the estimates upward.

31. Rodrik (1999b).
32. Galli and Kucera (2004).
33. The unions then played a critical role pushing the social and
economic agenda toward more welfare-oriented policies (Fishman
1990, Boix 1998, and Boix 2005).

34. Some  might  argue  that  the  Scandinavian  systems  are  not
easily replicable, on the grounds that they rely on extraordinary lev-
els of trust and social capital. In other words, the political condi-
tions necessary to obtain Scandinavian-type social democracy and
“solidaristic bargaining” might be difﬁcult to achieve in developing
countries, despite their potential economic beneﬁts. See Moene and
Wallerstein (2002). But this was not always the case; high levels of
trust emerged from widespread conﬂict in the mid-1930s.

discussion of how Brazil’s minimum wage does not seem to have
lifted  family  incomes  at  the  lower  points  of the  income  distri-
bution. In  Colombia, Arango  and  Pachón  (2004)  ﬁnd  that  “the

minimum  wage  ends  up  being  regressive, improving  the  living
conditions  of families  in  the  middle  and  the  upper  part  of the
income distribution with net losses for those at the bottom.”

41. See the ILO Web site (www.ilo.org) for a description of labor
standards. As an example of the range of policy choices for the spe-
ciﬁc case of child labor, see ILO (2003) and Burra (1995).

42. See World Bank (2004a). Almost 80 percent of Cambodia’s
overseas buyers rated labor standards as one of their top priorities
in sourcing decisions. They also stated that standards have had pos-
itive  effects  on  accident  rates, workplace  productivity, product
quality, turnover, and absenteeism.

43. López (2004).
44. There are two ways to measure outcomes: ex ante simula-
tion using CGE (Computable General Equilibrium) analysis and
ex post econometric analysis relying on household survey data. In
the  absence  of such  analysis, it  is  hard  to  predict  the  impact  of
trade reform on poverty or equity. A number of studies related to
the  themes  of this  section  can  be  found  in  Hertel  and  Winters
(2005).

45. Schiff and Valdés (1998), 30.
46. The  CGE  analysis  generates  price  and  wage  changes  that
include  the  direct  price  effect  of
trade  policy  changes  and
“second-round” indirect effects on factor returns and nontraded
goods prices. Certain dynamic gains from greater trade openness
are not captured. For instance, trade could bring new technolo-
gies  and  innovations  that  boost  long-term  productivity  (Raval-
lion 2004b).

Chapter 10

1. Pogge (2004).
2. Chauvet and Collier (2004) estimated that the cost, to a coun-
try  and  its  neighbors, of a  country  descending  into  the  status  of
low-income country under stress (LICUS), as deﬁned by the World
Bank, is in present value terms approximately $80 billion, and that
this cost was mostly borne by neighbors.

3. These  conclusions  are  consistent  with  the  ﬁndings  of the
World  Commission  on  the  Social  Dimensions  of Globalization
(2004).

4. Goldin and others (forthcoming).
5. That is, 4 percent not 4 percentage points.
6. Stark and Bloom (1985); Cox, Eser, and Jimenez (1998).
7. The assumption that income after migration is higher than
income  forgone  does  not  always  hold. Adams  ﬁnds  that  income
levels would have been higher without migration in three Egyptian
villages  and  would  have  been  the  same  in  four  rural  districts  in
Pakistan  (Adams  1989, 1992). Barham  and  Boucher  (1998)  ﬁnd
essentially  similar  results  for  three  neighborhoods  in  Nicaragua.
On  the  potential  impact  on  income  inequality, Mendola  (2004)
ﬁnds  that  remittances  from  members  of households  with  large
land holdings in rural Bangladesh are correlated with adoption of
new agricultural technologies, thus leading to higher productivity
for  already  better-off households  and  a  possible  increase  in
inequality.

8. McKenzie and Rapoport (2004).
9. A number of studies by the World Bank Research Program on
International  Migration  and  by  others  document  the  positive
impact of remittances. See Taylor (1992), Taylor and Wyatt (1996),
and  Yang  (2004)  for  examples  of easing  of credit  constraints.
Adams (2005) ﬁnds that Guatemalan households receiving remit-

Endnotes

245

tances  spend  signiﬁcantly  more  on  housing, which  has  positive
indirect effects on wages, business, and employment opportunities.
Yang (2004) ﬁnds that Filipino households receiving higher remit-
tances, because of positive exchange rate shocks, had greater child
schooling, reduced child labor, more hours worked in self-employ-
ment, and greater entry into relatively capital-intensive enterprises.

Ozden (2005); on brain drain, see Faini (2003) and Schiff (2005).

12. Mode IV is one of four interrelated modes of supply of serv-

ices across borders considered in the GATS.

13. As of May 2004, only 25 countries, mostly migrant-sending,

had ratiﬁed the convention.

14. An interesting example of innovative partnerships to facili-
tate remittance ﬂows is the New Alliance Task Force launched by
the  Federal  Deposit  Insurance  Corporation  (FDIC)  and  Mexican
Consulate  of Chicago, which  aims  to  improve  access  to  the  U.S.
banking system, provide ﬁnancial education, and develop products
with remittance features.

15. Smuggling and trafﬁcking are a multibillion dollar industry
increasingly run by criminal networks. The United Nations Inter-
national Organization for Migration (2000) estimated that up to 2
million women and children are trafﬁcked globally every year.

16. One  option  to  address  these  losses  is  to  lock  development
assistance  to  poor  countries  hurt  by  speciﬁc  measures  into  the
WTO agreements on these measures; see Ricupero (2005).

17. The  current  tariff structure  could  change  through  both
bilateral and multilateral negotiations. For instance, if the Central
American Free Trade Agreement is approved by the U.S. Congress,
most  textiles  from  countries  such  as  Honduras  and  El  Salvador
would beneﬁt from tariff-free entry into the United States, now the
case for some items under existing unilateral preferences.

18. See for example Birdsall (2002).
19. Price-ﬁxing by international cartels brings signiﬁcant losses
to developed- and developing-country consumers alike. Analysis of
six  high-proﬁle  cartels  uncovered  in  the  1990s  (vitamins, citric
acid, bromine, seamless  steel  tubes, graphite  electrodes, lysine)
indicated that the estimated price increases ranged from 10 percent
for stainless steel tubes to 45 percent for graphite electrodes, and
that cumulative overcharges to developing countries over the life of
the six cartels ranged from $3 billion to $7 billion, depending on
the  calculation  method. See  Connor  (2001), OECD  (2000), and
World Bank (2003b).

Measuring equity

This report has concerned itself with equity, a concept which
we have deﬁned to mean equality of opportunities and the
avoidance of absolute deprivation. As we made clear in the
report, the focus is mostly on inequality of opportunity, and
much less on overall inequality in a one-dimensional space,
such  as  income  or  education. We  might  be  quite  sanguine
about certain types of inequality across people if, for exam-
ple, their outcomes varied for reasons that had to do mainly
with their own efforts. But we are concerned with systematic
differences in opportunities between individuals and groups
of people  due  to  different “circumstances” not  under  their
control, i.e. when these groups are distinguishable from one
another  only  in  characteristics  that  in  some  sense  can  be
argued to be “morally irrelevant” to their opportunities and
outcomes in life.

To give the audience a sense of inequality of opportuni-
ties, we chose to present data on income/consumption, infant

mortality, and years of education in a slightly different format
than what we are normally used to seeing for as many coun-
tries in the world as possible. Table A1 presents poverty rates
using national poverty lines as well as those using the interna-
tional $1 and $2 per day poverty lines; information for the
national  poverty  line  is  also  presented  for  urban  and  rural
breakdowns of the population. Table A2 presents alternative
inequality measures to the commonly used Gini Index, fol-
lowed by evidence on inequality of land. In Table A3, we pre-
sent infant mortality rates for more than 50 countries by the
sex of the infant, the education level of the mother, the loca-
tion  (urban  or  rural)  of the  family, and  the  ranking  of the
household by an asset index. Finally, in Table A4, we present
educational attainment by location and gender, but also pre-
sent measures of inequality in years of schooling, along with
the share of this inequality that is attributable to gender and
location.

Technical notes 

Table A1 Poverty 
National  poverty  rate is  the  percentage  of the  population
living  below  the  national  poverty  line. Rural  (urban)
poverty rate is the percentage of the rural (urban) popula-
tion  living  below  the  national  rural  (urban)  poverty  line.
Population below $1 a day and population below $2 a day
are  the  percentages  of the  population  living  on  less  than
$1.08 a day and $2.15 a day at 1993 international prices. All
above  poverty  indicators  are  also  called  headcount  ratios.
Poverty  gap is  the  mean  shortfall  from  the  poverty  line
(counting the nonpoor as having zero shortfall), expressed
as a percentage of the poverty line.

To measure poverty, one needs to deﬁne the relevant wel-
fare measure, to select a poverty line, and to select a poverty
indicator. The two most commonly used poverty indicators
are the headcount ratio and the poverty gap, part of the FGT
class  of indexes  from  Foster, Greer, and  Thorbecke  (1984).
The indexes are deﬁned by

where i is a subgroup of individuals with income below the
poverty  line  Z; n is  the  total  number  of individuals  in  the
sample; Yi is  the  income  of individual  i; and α is  a  distin-
guishing parameter between FGT indexes. When α equals 0,
the expression simpliﬁes to J/n, or the headcount ratio. The
poverty gap is given by α equal to 1.

The  welfare  measure  can  be  income  or  consumption.
Income is generally more difﬁcult to measure accurately, and
consumption comes closer to the notion of standard of liv-
ing. And income can vary over time even if the standard of
living does not. So whenever possible, consumption data are
used  to  estimate  poverty. But  when  consumption  data  are
not available, income data are used.

Poverty line is a threshold below which a given household
or individual will be regarded as poor. National poverty lines
are  established  according  to  countries’ own  judgment  of
minimum  acceptable  living  standards. Because  countries
have different deﬁnitions of poverty, consistent comparisons
between countries can be difﬁcult. Local poverty lines tend
to  have  higher  purchasing  power  in  rich  countries, where
more generous standards are used than in poor countries. Is
it reasonable to treat two people with the same standard of
living—in terms of their command over commodities—dif-
ferently because one happens to live in a better-off country?
Poverty measures based on an international poverty line
attempt to hold the real value of the poverty line constant
across countries, as is done when making comparisons over
time. The  commonly  used  $1  a  day  standard, an  interna-
tional  poverty  line  measured  in  1985  international  prices

and adjusted to local currency using purchasing power pari-
ties  (PPP), was  chosen  because  it  is  typical  of the  national
poverty lines in low-income countries. Recalculated in 1993
consumption PPP terms in 1993 prices, the original $1 a day
in 1985 PPP is now about $1.08 a day. PPP exchange rates are
used because they take into account the local prices of goods
and services not traded internationally. But PPP rates were
designed for comparing aggregates from national accounts,
not  for  making  international  poverty  comparisons. As  a
result, there is no certainty that an international poverty line
measures  the  same  degree  of need  or  deprivation  across
countries. Furthermore, any revisions in the PPP of a coun-
try to incorporate better price indexes can produce dramati-
cally different poverty lines in local currency.

Since  the  World  Bank  produced  its  ﬁrst  global  poverty
estimates for World Development Report 1990 using house-
hold  survey  data, the  database  has  expanded  considerably
and  now  includes  440  surveys  representing  almost  100
developing  countries. Some  1.1  million  randomly  sampled
households were interviewed in these surveys, representing
93 percent of the population of developing countries. Along
with improvements in data coverage and quality, the under-
lying methodology has also improved, resulting in better and
more comprehensive estimates.

Data availability. Since 1979 there has been considerable
expansion  in  the  number  of countries  that  ﬁeld  such  sur-
veys, in the frequency of the surveys, and in the quality of
their data. The number of data sets rose dramatically from a
mere 13 between 1979 and 1981, to 100 between 1997 and
1999. Sub-Saharan Africa continues to lag behind all other
regions, with only 28 countries out of 48 having at least one
data set available.

Data  quality. A  number  of issues  arise  in  measuring
household  living  standards  from  survey  data. As  indicated
above, one relates to the choice of income or consumption as
a welfare indicator. Another issue is that household surveys
can differ widely, for example, in the number of consumer
goods  they  identify. And  even  similar  surveys  may  not  be
strictly  comparable  because  of differences  in  timing  or  the
quality and training of survey enumerators.

Comparisons of countries at different levels of develop-
ment pose a potential problem because of differences in the
relative  importance  of consumption  of nonmarket  goods.
The local market value of all consumption in kind (includ-
ing own production, particularly important in underdevel-
oped  rural  economies)  should  be  included  in  total  con-
sumption  expenditure. Similarly, imputed  proﬁt  from  the
production  of nonmarket  goods  should  be  included  in
income. This  is  not  always  done, though  such  omissions
were a far bigger problem in surveys before the 1980s. Most
survey  data  now  include  valuations  for  consumption  or
income from own production. Nonetheless, valuation meth-
ods  vary. For  example, some  surveys  use  the  price  in  the

nearest market, while others use the average farm-gate sell-
ing price.

In all cases the measures of poverty have been calculated
from primary data sources (tabulations or household data)
rather than existing estimates. Estimation from tabulations
uses an interpolation method based on Lorenz curves with
ﬂexible functional forms, which have proved reliable in past
work. Empirical Lorenz curves were weighted by household
size, so  they  are  based  on  percentiles  of population, not
households.

The Poverty Monitoring team in the World Bank’s Devel-
opment Research Group calculates the number of people liv-
ing below various international poverty lines, as well as other
poverty and inequality measures that are published in World
Development Indicators. That database is updated annually as
new survey data become available, and a major reassessment
of progress against poverty is made about every three years.

Table A2 Income Distribution
The Gini index measures the extent to which the distribu-
tion of income/consumption (or land) among individuals
or households within an economy deviates from a perfectly
equal distribution. A Lorenz curve plots the cumulative per-
centage of total income received against the cumulative pro-
portion of recipients, starting with the poorest individual or
household. The  Gini  index  measures  the  area  between  the
Lorenz  curve  and  a  hypothetical  line  of absolute  equality,
expressed as the share of the maximum area under the line.
Thus a Gini index of zero represents perfect equality, while
an index of 1 implies perfect inequality. The Gini coefﬁcient
takes on values between 0 and 1 with zero interpreted as no
inequality.

The  value  of the  measure  GE  ranges  from  0  to  inﬁnity,
with  zero  representing  an  equal  distribution  (all  incomes
identical)  and  higher  values  represent  higher  levels  of
inequality. The  parameter  c in  the  GE  class  represents  the
weight given to distances between incomes at different parts
of the income distribution, and can take any real value. For
lower  values  of c, GE  is  more  sensitive  to  changes  in  the
lower  tail  of the  distribution, and  for  higher  values  GE  is
more sensitive to changes that affect the upper tail. The most

common values of c used are 0, 1 and 2: hence a value of c =0
gives more weight to distances between incomes in the lower
tail; c = 1 applies equal weights across the distribution; and a
value of c = 2 give proportionately more weight to gaps in
the  upper  tail. The  GE  measures  with  parameters  0  and  1
become, with  l’Hopital’s  rule, two  of Theil’s  measures  of
inequality  (Theil, 1967), the  mean  log  deviation  and  the
Theil-T index respectively, as follows:

90th/10th percentile  ratio is  constructed  by  dividing  the
income (consumption) in the 90th percentile by the income
(consumption)  in  the  10th percentile. A  90th/10th ratio  of 5
means that the household in the 90th percentile earns (spends)
ﬁve times as much as the household in the 10th percentile.

Survey year gives  the  year  in  which  the  country  survey

used to generate the reported data was completed.

Table A3 Health
To measure equity in health, we have only used data from 123
Demographic  Health  Surveys  (DHS)  collected  in  67  coun-
tries between 1985 and 2002. In addition to breaking down
infant mortality rates by “asset indices” created by Filmer and
Pritchett  (1998)  (as  documented  in  Gwatkin  and  others
(2003, 2004), we compiled population breakdowns for differ-
ent  groupings  using  the  interactive “STATcompiler” feature
in the DHS website.

Infant mortality rate is the number of deaths to children
under 12 months of age per 1,000 live births. Figures used in
the table are based on births in the 10 years preceding the
survey.

Asset quintiles are constructed using the Filmer-Pritch-
ett  method  to  create  an  index  of wealth  based  on  20–30
household attributes—type of ﬂooring and/or roof, source
of water, availability of electricity, possession of such items
as watches, radios, etc. Once the index is created it is applied
to the country’s household surveys to construct a distribu-
tion of assets that is then divided into ﬁfths, each household
belonging to one of these quintiles. Indicators for the quin-
tiles are then formed as the average result for all families for
that  indicator  (e.g. infant  mortality  rate)  within  each  asset
quintile.

Education is  the  number  of years  (or  level)  of formal
education  the  child’s  mother  has  completed  at  the  time  of
the survey.

Gender is  the  sex  of the  child  (male  or  female)  as
reported by the child’s mother (or household head if mother
is not present).

WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2006

Location is listed as urban if the surveyed household lives
in  a  recognized  city  or  surroundings, and  listed  as  rural  if
otherwise.

The GE class of inequality measures can be decomposed
into a between- and within-group component along the fol-
lowing lines:

Table A4 Education
For measuring educational attainment, we used a database
that was put together by Araujo, Ferreira, and Schady. The
data  come  from  the  individual-level  records  of various
household  surveys  for  124  countries. The  selection  criteria
were to choose a survey instrument that: (a) was nationally
representative; (b)  was  collected  on  2000  or  on  the  closest
year; and (c) included information on the actual number of
years of education completed by the interviewees. The ﬁve-
year cohorts group adults who were likely to have completed
their  education  at  the  time  of the  survey. The  cohorts  are
constructed based on one survey per country.

The  measure  share  of total  population  by  years  of
schooling gives the percent of the population having com-
pleted the reported number of years of schooling at the time
the survey was taken.

Mean years of schooling gives  the  arithmetic  mean  for
years of formal schooling for the total population, those liv-
ing in urban areas, and those living in rural areas, as well as
for males and females.

The  Gini  index  and  the  Generalized  Entropy  indexes
reported in this table are the same as those described in table
A2, except for the fact that y now denotes years of schooling.
We report the share of inequality in education which is
due to differences between urban and rural dwellers (loca-
tion) and between males and females (gender).

where µ is average per capita consumption, j refers to sub-
groups, g j refers to the population share of group j, and GE j
refers to inequality in group j. The between-group compo-
nent of inequality is captured by the ﬁrst term to the right of
the  equal  sign. It  can  be  interpreted  as  measuring  what
would be the level of inequality in the population if everyone
within  the  group  had  the  same  (group  average)  consump-
tion level µ j. The second term on the right reﬂects the within
group inequality GE j. Ratios of the respective components
with  the  overall  inequality  level  provide  a  measure  of per-
centage  contribution  of between-group  and  within-group
inequality to total inequality.

Selected world development 
indicators

In this year’s edition, development data are presented in four
tables presenting comparative socioeconomic data for more
than 130 economies for the most recent year for which data
are available and, for some indicators, for an earlier year. An
additional table presents basic indicators for 75 economies
with sparse data or with populations of less than 2 million.

The indicators presented here are a selection from more
than  800  included  in  World  Development  Indicators  2005.
Published annually, World Development Indicators reﬂects a
comprehensive view of the development process. Its opening
chapter  reports  on  the  Millennium  Development  Goals,
which grew out of agreements and resolutions of world con-
ferences organized by the United Nations (U.N.) in the past
decade, and  reafﬁrmed  at  the  Millennium  Summit  in  Sep-
tember 2000 by member countries of the U.N. The other ﬁve
main sections recognize the contribution of a wide range of
factors: human capital development, environmental sustain-
ability, macroeconomic  performance, private  sector  devel-
opment and the investment climate, and the global links that
inﬂuence the external environment for development. World
Development  Indicators  is  complemented  by  a  separately
published database that gives access to over 1,000 data tables
and  800  time-series  indicators  for  222  economies  and
regions. This database is available through an electronic sub-
scription (WDI Online) or as a CD-ROM.

Data sources and methodology
Socioeconomic and environmental data presented here are
drawn  from  several  sources: primary  data  collected  by  the
World  Bank, member  country  statistical  publications,
research  institutes, and  international  organizations  such  as
the U.N. and its specialized agencies, the International Mon-
etary Fund (IMF), and the Organisation for Economic Co-
operation  and  Development  (OECD). Although  interna-
tional  standards  of coverage, deﬁnition, and  classiﬁcation
apply  to  most  statistics  reported  by  countries  and  interna-
tional agencies, there are inevitably differences in timeliness

and reliability arising from differences in the capabilities and
resources devoted to basic data collection and compilation.
For some topics, competing sources of data require review
by  World  Bank  staff to  ensure  that  the  most  reliable  data
available  are  presented. In  some  instances, where  available
data  are  deemed  too  weak  to  provide  reliable  measures  of
levels  and  trends  or  do  not  adequately  adhere  to  interna-
tional standards, the data are not shown.

The data presented are generally consistent with those in
World Development Indicators 2005. However, data have been
revised and updated wherever new information has become
available. Differences may also reﬂect revisions to historical
series  and  changes  in  methodology. Thus  data  of different
vintages  may  be  published  in  different  editions  of World
Bank publications. Readers are advised not to compile data
series from different publications or different editions of the
same  publication. Consistent  time-series  data  are  available
on  World  Development  Indicators  2005  CD-ROM  and
through WDI Online.

All dollar ﬁgures are in current U.S. dollars unless other-
wise  stated. The  various  methods  used  to  convert  from
national currency ﬁgures are described in the Technical notes.
Because the World Bank’s primary business is providing
lending  and  policy  advice  to  its  low-  and  middle-income
members, the issues covered in these tables focus mainly on
these economies. Where available, information on the high-
income economies is also provided for comparison. Readers
may  wish  to  refer  to  national  statistical  publications  and
publications of the OECD and the European Union for more
information on the high-income economies.

Classiﬁcation of economies 
and summary measures
The summary measures at the bottom of each table include
economies  classiﬁed  by  income  per  capita  and  by  region.
GNI  per  capita  is  used  to  determine  the  following  income
classiﬁcations: low-income, $825  or  less  in  2004; middle-

290

WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2006

income, $826  to  $10,065; and  high-income, $10,066  and
above. A further division at GNI per capita $3,255 is made
between  lower-middle-income  and  upper-middle-income
economies. See the table on classiﬁcation of economies on
the next page for a list of economies in each group (includ-
ing those with populations of less than 2 million).

Summary measures are either totals (indicated by t if the
aggregates  include  estimates  for  missing  data  and  nonre-
porting  countries, or  by  an  s  for  simple  sums  of the  data
available), weighted averages (w), or median values (m) cal-
culated  for  groups  of economies. Data  for  the  countries
excluded from the main tables (those presented in Table 5)
have  been  included  in  the  summary  measures, where  data
are  available, or  by  assuming  that  they  follow  the  trend  of
reporting countries. This gives a more consistent aggregated
measure by standardizing country coverage for each period
shown. Where missing information accounts for a third or
more of the overall estimate, however, the group measure is
reported as not available. The section on Statistical methods
in the Technical notes provides further information on aggre-
gation methods. Weights used to construct the aggregates are
listed in the technical notes for each table.

From time to time an economy’s classiﬁcation is revised
because of changes in the above cutoff values or in the econ-
omy’s measured level of GNI per capita. When such changes
occur, aggregates based on those classiﬁcations are recalcu-
lated  for  the  past  period  so  that  a  consistent  time  series  is
maintained.

Terminology and country coverage
The term country does not imply political independence but
may refer to any territory for which authorities report separate
social or economic statistics. Data are shown for economies as
they were constituted in 2003, and historical data are revised to
reﬂect current political arrangements. Throughout the tables,
exceptions are noted.

Technical notes
Because data quality and intercountry comparisons are often
problematic, readers are encouraged to consult the Technical
notes, the table on Classiﬁcation of Economies by Region and
Income (next page), and the footnotes to the tables. For more
extensive  documentation  see  World  Development  Indicators
2005.

Note: a. Regional aggregates include data for economies that are not speciﬁed elsewhere. World and income group totals include aid not allocated by country or region. b. Includes
Luxembourg. c. Data are from debt sustainability analysis undertaken as part of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative. d. Includes re-exports. e. Data are estimates and reﬂect
borrowing by the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia that are not yet allocated to the successor republics. f. Data on total exports and imports refer to South Africa only. Data on
export commodity shares refer to the South African Customs Union (Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, South Africa, and Swaziland). g. GNI refers to mainaland Tanzania only. i. World totals com-
puted by the UN sum to zero, but because the aggregates shown here refer to World Bank deﬁnitions, regional and income group totals do not equal zero. j. Data include the intratrade of the
Baltic states and the Commonwealth of Independent States.

Technical notes
These technical notes discuss the sources and methods used
to compile the indicators included in this edition of Selected
World Development Indicators. The notes follow the order
in  which  the  indicators  appear  in  the  tables. Note  that  the
Selected World Development Indicators uses terminology in
line with the 1993 System of National Accounts (SNA). For
example, in  the  1993  SNA  gross  national  income  replaces
gross national product.

Sources
The  data  published  in  the  Selected  World  Development
Indicators  are  taken  from  World  Development  Indicators
2005. Where possible, however, revisions reported since the
closing date of that edition have been incorporated. In addi-
tion, newly  released  estimates  of population  and  gross
national income (GNI) per capita for 2004 are included in
table 1.

The World Bank draws on a variety of sources for the sta-
tistics published in the World Development Indicators. Data
on  external  debt  for  developing  countries  are  reported
directly to the World Bank by developing member countries
through the Debtor Reporting System. Other data are drawn
mainly from the U.N. and its specialized agencies, from the
IMF, and from country reports to the World Bank. Bank staff
estimates  are  also  used  to  improve  currentness  or  consis-
tency. For  most  countries, national  accounts  estimates  are
obtained  from  member  governments  through World  Bank
economic missions. In some instances these are adjusted by
staff to ensure conformity with international deﬁnitions and
concepts. Most social data from national sources are drawn
from regular administrative ﬁles, special surveys, or periodic
censuses.

For more detailed notes about the data, please refer to the

World Bank’s World Development Indicators 2005.

Data consistency and reliability 
Considerable effort has been made to standardize the data,
but full comparability cannot be assured, and care must be
taken in interpreting the indicators. Many factors affect data
availability, comparability, and reliability: statistical systems
in  many  developing  economies  are  still  weak; statistical
methods, coverage, practices, and  deﬁnitions  differ  widely;
and  cross-country  and  intertemporal  comparisons  involve
complex technical and conceptual problems that cannot be
unequivocally resolved. Data coverage may not be complete
because  of special  circumstances  or  for  economies  experi-
encing  problems  (such  as  those  stemming  from  conﬂicts)
affecting the collection and reporting of data. For these rea-
sons, although the data are drawn from the sources thought
to be most authoritative, they should be construed only as
indicating  trends  and  characterizing  major  differences

Selected world development indicators

among economies rather than offering precise quantitative
measures  of those  differences. Discrepancies  in  data  pre-
sented  in  different  editions  reﬂect  updates  by  countries  as
well as revisions to historical series and changes in method-
ology. Thus readers are advised not to compare data series
between  editions  or  between  different  editions  of World
Bank publications. Consistent time series are available from
the World Development Indicators 2005 CD-ROM.

Ratios and growth rates 
For ease of reference, the tables usually show ratios and rates
of growth rather than the simple underlying values. Values
in their original form are available from the World Develop-
ment  Indicators  2005  CD-ROM. Unless  otherwise  noted,
growth rates are computed using the least-squares regression
method  (see  statistical  methods on  page  305). Because  this
method takes into account all available observations during
a  period, the  resulting  growth  rates  reﬂect  general  trends
that  are  not  unduly  inﬂuenced  by  exceptional  values. To
exclude  the  effects  of inﬂation, constant  price  economic
indicators are used in calculating growth rates. Data in italics
are for a year or period other than that speciﬁed in the col-
umn heading—up to two years before or after for economic
indicators and up to three years for social indicators, because
the latter tend to be collected less regularly and change less
dramatically over short periods.

Constant price series 
An economy’s growth is measured by the increase in value
added produced by the individuals and enterprises operating
in that economy. Thus measuring real growth requires esti-
mates of GDP and its components valued in constant prices.
The  World  Bank  collects  constant  price  national  accounts
series  in  national  currencies  and  recorded  in  the  country’s
original base year. To obtain comparable series of constant
price data, it rescales GDP and value added by industrial ori-
gin to a common reference year, currently 2000. This process
gives rise to a discrepancy between the rescaled GDP and the
sum of the rescaled components. Because allocating the dis-
crepancy would give rise to distortions in the growth rate, it
is left unallocated.

Summary measures 
The summary measures for regions and income groups, pre-
sented  at  the  end  of most  tables, are  calculated  by  simple
addition when they are expressed in levels. Aggregate growth
rates and ratios are usually computed as weighted averages.
The summary measures for social indicators are weighted by
population  or  subgroups  of population, except  for  infant
mortality, which is weighted by the number of births. See the
notes on speciﬁc indicators for more information.

302

WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2006

For  summary  measures  that  cover  many  years, calcula-
tions are based on a uniform group of economies so that the
composition  of the  aggregate  does  not  change  over  time.
Group measures are compiled only if the data available for a
given year account for at least two-thirds of the full group, as
deﬁned for the 2000 benchmark year. As long as this crite-
rion  is  met, economies  for  which  data  are  missing  are
assumed to behave like those that provide estimates. Readers
should  keep  in  mind  that  the  summary  measures  are  esti-
mates  of representative  aggregates  for  each  topic  and  that
nothing  meaningful  can  be  deduced  about  behavior  at  the
country  level  by  working  back  from  group  indicators. In
addition, the estimation process may result in discrepancies
between subgroup and overall totals.

Table 1. Key indicators of development
Population is based on the de facto deﬁnition, which counts
all residents, regardless of legal status or citizenship, except
for refugees not permanently settled in the country of asy-
lum, who are generally considered part of the population of
the country of origin.

Average annual population growth rate is the exponen-
tial rate of change for the period (see the section on statisti-
cal methods on page 305).

Population density is midyear population divided by land
area. Land area is a country’s total area excluding areas under
inland bodies of water and coastal waterways. Density is cal-
culated using the most recently available data on land area.

Gross  national  income (GNI—formerly  gross  national
product or GNP), the broadest measure of national income,
measures  total  value  added  from  domestic  and  foreign
sources claimed by residents. GNI comprises gross domestic
product  (GDP)  plus  net  receipts  of primary  income  from
foreign sources. Data are converted from national currency
to current U.S. dollars using the World Bank Atlas method.
This involves using a three-year average of exchange rates to
smooth the effects of transitory exchange rate ﬂuctuations.
See the section on statistical methods for discussion of the
Atlas method.

GNI per capita is GNI divided by midyear population. It
is converted into current U.S. dollars by the Atlas method.
The World Bank uses GNI per capita in U.S dollars to classify
economies for analytical purposes and to determine borrow-
ing eligibility.

PPP gross national income, which is GNI converted into
international  dollars  using  purchasing  power  parity  (PPP)
conversion  factors, is  included  because  nominal  exchange
rates do not always reﬂect international differences in rela-
tive prices. At the PPP rate, one international dollar has the
same purchasing power over domestic GNI that the U.S. dol-
lar has over U.S. GNI. PPP rates allow a standard compari-
son  of real  price  levels  between  countries, just  as  conven-
tional  price  indexes  allow  comparison  of real  values  over

time. The PPP conversion factors used here are derived from
price surveys covering 118 countries conducted by the Inter-
national  Comparison  Program. For  Organisation  for  Eco-
nomic  Co-operation  and  Development  (OECD)  countries
data  come  from  the  most  recent  round  of surveys, com-
pleted in 1999; the rest are either from the 1996 survey, or
data from the 1993 or earlier round and extrapolated to the
1996 benchmark. Estimates for countries not included in the
surveys  are  derived  from  statistical  models  using  available
data.

PPP GNI per capita is PPP GNI divided by midyear pop-

ulation.

Gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  per  capita  growth is
based on GDP measured in constant prices. Growth in GDP
is considered a broad measure of the growth of an economy.
GDP in constant prices can be estimated by measuring the
total  quantity  of goods  and  services  produced  in  a  period,
valuing them at an agreed set of base year prices, and sub-
tracting  the  cost  of intermediate  inputs, also  in  constant
prices. See  the  section  on  statistical  methods  for  details  of
the least-squares growth rate.

Life expectancy at birth is  the  number  of years  a  new-
born infant would live if patterns of mortality prevailing at
its birth were to stay the same throughout its life.

Adult literacy rate is the percentage of persons aged 15
and  above  who  can, with  understanding, read  and  write  a
short, simple statement about their everyday life.

Carbon  dioxide  (CO2)  emissions  measures  those  emis-
sions  stemming  from  the  burning  of fossil  fuels  and  the
manufacture of cement. These include carbon dioxide pro-
duced during consumption of solid, liquid, and gas fuels and
from gas ﬂaring.

The  Carbon  Dioxide  Information  Analysis  Center
(CDIAC), sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy, cal-
culates annual anthropogenic emissions of CO2. These calcu-
lations  are  derived  from  data  on  fossil  fuel  consumption,
based  on  the  World  Energy  Data  Set  maintained  by  the
UNSD, and  from  data  on  world  cement  manufacturing,
based on the Cement Manufacturing Data Set maintained by
the U.S. Bureau of Mines. Each year the CDIAC recalculates
the entire time series from 1950 to the present, incorporating
its most recent ﬁndings and the latest corrections to its data-
base. Fuels supplied to ships and aircraft engaged in interna-
tional transportation are excluded in these estimates because
of the difﬁculty of apportioning these fuels among the coun-
tries beneﬁting from that transport.

Table 2. Millennium Development Goals:
eradicating poverty and improving lives
Proportion of population below $1 a day (PPP$) is the per-
centage of the population living on less than $1.08 a day at
1993  international  prices. For  further  information  on
poverty data, see the technical note for Table A1.

Prevalence  of child  malnutrition is  the  percentage  of
children under ﬁve whose weight for age is less than minus
two  standard  deviations  from  the  median  for  the  interna-
tional reference population ages 0–59 months. The reference
population, adopted  by  the  World  Health  Organization
(WHO) in 1983, is based on children from the United States,
who  are  assumed  to  be  well  nourished. Estimates  of child
malnutrition are from national survey data. The proportion
of children who are underweight is the most common indi-
cator  of malnutrition. Being  underweight, even  mildly,
increases  the  risk  of death  and  inhibits  cognitive  develop-
ment in children. Moreover, it perpetuates the problem from
one  generation  to  the  next, as  malnourished  women  are
more likely to have low-birth-weight babies.

Primary  completion  rate is  the  percentage  of students
completing the last year of primary school. It is calculated by
taking the total number of students in the last grade of pri-
mary  school, minus  the  number  of repeaters  in  that  grade,
divided by the total number of children of ofﬁcial graduation
age. The primary completion rate reﬂects the primary cycle as
deﬁned by the International Standard Classiﬁcation of Educa-
tion  (ISCED), ranging  from  three  or  four  years  of primary
education (in a very small number of countries) to ﬁve or six
years  (in  most  countries), and  seven  (in  a  small  number  of
countries). Because curricula and standards for school com-
pletion vary across countries, a high rate of primary comple-
tion does not necessarily mean high levels of student learning.
Gender parity ratio in primary and secondary school is
the ratio of female gross enrollment rate in primary and sec-
ondary school to the gross enrollment rate of males. Eliminat-
ing gender disparities in education would help to increase the
status and capabilities of women. This indicator is an imper-
fect measure of the relative accessibility of schooling for girls.
With a target date of 2005, this is the ﬁrst of the targets to fall
due. School  enrollment  data  are  reported  to  the  UNESCO
Institute for Statistics by national education authorities. Pri-
mary education provides children with basic reading, writing,
and mathematics skills along with an elementary understand-
ing  of such  subjects  as  history, geography, natural  science,
social science, art, and music. Secondary education completes
the  provision  of basic  education  that  began  at  the  primary
level, and aims at laying foundations for lifelong learning and
human  development, by  offering  more  subject-or  skill-
oriented instruction using more specialized teachers.

Under-ﬁve mortality rate is the probability that a new-
born baby will die before reaching age ﬁve, if subject to cur-
rent age-speciﬁc mortality rates. The probability is expressed
as a rate per 1,000. The main sources of mortality data are
vital  registration  systems  and  direct  or  indirect  estimates
based  on  sample  surveys  or  censuses. To  produce  harmo-
nized estimates of under-ﬁve mortality rates that make use
of all available information in a transparent way, a method-
ology that ﬁts a regression line to the relationship between

mortality rates and their reference dates using weighted least
squares  was  developed  and  adopted  by  both  UNICEF  and
the World Bank.

Prevalence of HIV is the percentage of people ages 15–49
who  are  infected  with  HIV. Adult  HIV  prevalence  rates
reﬂect  the  rate  of HIV  infection  in  each  country’s  popula-
tion. Low national prevalence rates can be very misleading,
however. They often disguise serious epidemics that are ini-
tially  concentrated  in  certain  localities  or  among  speciﬁc
population groups and threaten to spill over into the wider
population. In many parts of the developing world most new
infections occur in young adults, with young women espe-
cially vulnerable. The estimates of HIV prevalence are based
on extrapolations from data collected through surveys and
from surveillance of small, nonrepresentative groups.

Maternal mortality rate is the number of women who die
from pregnancy-related causes during pregnancy and child-
birth, per 100,000 live births. The data shown here have been
collected  in  various  years  and  adjusted  to  a  common  1995
base year. The values are modeled estimates based on an exer-
cise  carried  out  by  the  World  Health  Organization  (WHO)
and United Nations Children’s Fund(UNICEF). In this exer-
cise maternal mortality was estimated with a regression model
using  information  on  fertility, birth  attendants, and  HIV
prevalence. This  cannot  be  assumed  to  provide  an  accurate
estimate of maternal mortality in any country in the table.

Births attended by skilled health staff are the percentage
of deliveries attended by personnel trained to give the neces-
sary  supervision, care, and  advice  to  women  during  preg-
nancy, labor, and the postpartum period, to conduct deliveries
on their own, and to care for newborns. The share of births
attended by skilled health staff is an indicator of a health sys-
tem’s ability to provide adequate care for a pregnant women.
Good antenatal and postnatal care improves maternal health
and reduces maternal and infant mortality. But data may not
reﬂect such improvements because health information system
are often weak, material deaths are underreported, and rates
of maternal mortality are difﬁcult to measure.

Table 3. Economic activity
Gross domestic product is gross value added, at purchasers’
prices, by  all  resident  producers  in  the  economy  plus  any
taxes and minus any subsidies not included in the value of the
products. It is calculated without deducting for depreciation
of fabricated assets or for depletion or degradation of natural
resources. Value added is the net output of an industry after
adding  up  all  outputs  and  subtracting  intermediate  inputs.
The  industrial  origin  of value  added  is  determined  by  the
International Standard Industrial Classiﬁcation (ISIC) revi-
sion 3. The World Bank conventionally uses the U.S. dollar
and applies the average ofﬁcial exchange rate reported by the
International Monetary Fund for the year shown. An alterna-
tive conversion factor is applied if the ofﬁcial exchange rate is

304

WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2006

judged to diverge by an exceptionally large margin from the
rate effectively applied to transactions in foreign currencies
and traded products.

Gross domestic product average annual growth rate is

calculated from constant price GDP data in local currency.

Agricultural productivity refers  to  the  ratio  of agricul-
tural value added, measured in constant 2000 U.S. dollars, to
the number of workers in agriculture.

Value added is the net output of an industry after adding
up  all  out-puts  and  subtracting  intermediate  inputs. The
industrial origin of value added is determined by the Inter-
national Standard Industrial Classiﬁcation (ISIC) revision 3.
Agriculture  value  added corresponds  to  ISIC  divisions

1–5 and includes forestry and ﬁshing.

Industry  value  added comprises  mining, manufacturing,
construction, electricity, water, and gas (ISIC divisions 10–45).
Services value added correspond to ISIC divisions 50–99.
Household  ﬁnal  consumption  expenditure  (private
consumption in previous editions) is the market value of all
goods and services, including durable products (such as cars,
washing  machines, and  home  computers), purchased  by
households. It excludes purchases of dwellings but includes
imputed rent for owner-occupied dwellings. It also includes
payments  and  fees  to  governments  to  obtain  permits  and
licenses. Here, household consumption expenditure includes
the  expenditures  of nonproﬁt  institutions  serving  house-
holds, even  when  reported  separately  by  the  country. In
practice, household consumption expenditure may include
any statistical discrepancy in the use of resources relative to
the supply of resources.

General  government  ﬁnal  consumption  expenditure
(general  government  consumption  in  previous  editions)
includes all government current expenditures for purchases
of goods and services (including compensation of employ-
ees). It also includes most expenditures on national defense
and security, but excludes government military expenditures
that are part of government capital formation.

Gross  capital  formation (gross  domestic  investment  in
previous editions) consists of outlays on additions to the ﬁxed
assets of the economy plus net changes in the level of invento-
ries  and  valuables. Fixed  assets  include  land  improvements
(fences, ditches, drains, and  so  on); plant, machinery, and
equipment  purchases; and  the  construction  of buildings,
roads, railways, and the like, including commercial and indus-
trial buildings, ofﬁces, schools, hospitals, and private dwellings.
Inventories are stocks of goods held by ﬁrms to meet tempo-
rary  or  unexpected  ﬂuctuations  in  production  or  sales, and
“work in progress”. According to the 1993 SNA net acquisitions
of valuables are also considered capital formation.

External  balance  of goods  and  services  is  exports  of
goods and services less imports of goods and services. Trade
in goods and services comprise all transactions between res-

idents  of a  country  and  the  rest  of the  world  involving  a
change in ownership of general merchandise, goods sent for
processing and repairs, nonmonetary gold, and services.

The GDP implicit deﬂator reﬂects changes in prices for all
ﬁnal  demand  categories, such  as  government  consumption,
capital formation, and international trade, as well as the main
component, private  ﬁnal  consumption. It  is  derived  as  the
ratio of current to constant price GDP. The GDP deﬂator may
also be calculated explicitly as a Paasche price index in which
the weights are the current period quantities of output.

National  accounts  indicators  for  most  developing  coun-
tries are collected from national statistical organizations and
central banks by visiting and resident World Bank missions.
Data for high-income economies come from the OECD data
ﬁles.

Table 4. Trade, aid, and ﬁnance
Merchandise exports show the f.o.b. (free on board) value of
goods provided to the rest of the world valued in U.S. dollars.
Merchandise imports show the c.i.f. value of goods (the
cost of the goods including insurance and freight) purchased
from  the  rest  of the  world  valued  in  U.S. dollars. Data  on
merchandise trade come from the World Trade Organization
(WTO) in its annual report.

Manufactured  exports  comprise  the  commodities  in
Standard  Industrial  Trade  Classiﬁcation  (SITC)  sections  5
(chemicals), 6  (basic  manufactures), 7  (machinery  and
transport  equipment), and  8  (miscellaneous  manufactured
goods), excluding division 68.

High  technology  exports  are  products  with  high  R&D
intensity. They include high-technology products such as in
aerospace, computers, pharmaceuticals, scientiﬁc  instru-
ments, and electrical machinery.

Current  account  balance is  the  sum  of net  exports  of

goods and services, net income, and net current transfers.

Net private capital ﬂows consist of private debt and non-
debt  ﬂows. Private  debt  ﬂows  include  commercial  bank
lending, bonds, and  other  private  credits; nondebt  private
ﬂows  are  foreign  direct  investment  and  portfolio  equity
investment.

Foreign direct investment is net inﬂows of investment to
acquire a lasting management interest (10 percent or more
of voting  stock)  in  an  enterprise  operating  in  an  economy
other than that of the investor. It is the sum of equity capital,
re-investment  of earnings, other  long-term  capital, and
short-term  capital, as  shown  in  the  balance  of payments.
Data  on  the  current  account  balance, private  capital  ﬂows,
and foreign direct investment are drawn from the IMF’s Bal-
ance of Payments Statistics Yearbook and International Finan-
cial Statistics.

Ofﬁcial development assistance or ofﬁcial aid from the
high-income members of the OECD are the main source of

ofﬁcial external ﬁnance for developing countries, but ofﬁcial
development  assistance  (ODA)  is  also  disbursed  by  some
important donor countries that are not members of OECD’s
Development Assistance Committee (DAC). DAC has three
criteria  for  ODA: it  is  undertaken  by  the  ofﬁcial  sector; it
promotes economic development or welfare as a main objec-
tive; and it is provided on concessional terms, with a grant
element of at least 25 percent on loans.

Ofﬁcial  development  assistance  comprises  grants  and
loans, net  of repayments, that  meet  the  DAC  deﬁnition  of
ODA and are made to countries and territories in part I of
the DAC list of aid recipients. Ofﬁcial aid comprises grants
and ODA-like loans, net of repayments, to countries and ter-
ritories in part II of the DAC list of aid recipients. Bilateral
grants are transfers in money or in kind for which no repay-
ment is required. Bilateral loans are loans extended by gov-
ernments or ofﬁcial agencies that have a grant element of at
least 25 percent and for which repayment is required in con-
vertible currencies or in kind.

Total  external  debt

is  debt  owed  to  nonresidents
repayable  in  foreign  currency, goods, or  services. It  is  the
sum of public, publicly guaranteed, and private non-guaran-
teed long-term debt, use of IMF credit, and short-term debt.
Short-term debt includes all debt having an original matu-
rity of one year or less and interest in arrears on long-term
debt.

Present value of debt is the sum of short-term external
debt plus the discounted sum of total debt service payments
due on public, publicly guaranteed, and private nonguaran-
teed long-term external debt over the life of existing loans.

The  main  sources  of external  debt  information  are
reports to the World Bank through its Debtor Reporting Sys-
tem from member countries that have received World Bank
loans. Additional information has been drawn from the ﬁles
of the  World  Bank  and  the  IMF. Summary  tables  of the
external debt of developing countries are published annually
in the World Bank’s Global Development Finance.

Net migration is the total number of migrants during the
period, that is, the number of immigrants less the number of
emigrants, including  both  citizens  and  noncitizens. Data
shown in the table are ﬁve-year estimates. Data are from the
United  Nations  Population  Division’s  World  Population
Prospects: The 2004 Revision.

Domestic credit provided by banking sector includes all
credit to various sectors on a gross basis, with the exception
of credit to the central government, which is net. The bank-
ing  sector  includes  monetary  authorities, deposit  money
banks, and  other  banking  institutions  for  which  data  are
available (including institutions that do not accept transfer-
able deposits but do incur such liabilities as time and savings
deposits). Examples  of other  banking  institutions  include
savings  and  mortgage  loan  institutions  and  building  and

Statistical methods 
This  section  describes  the  calculation  of the  least-squares
growth rate, the exponential (endpoint) growth rate, and the
World Bank’s Atlas methodology for calculating the conver-
sion factor used to estimate GNI and GNI per capita in U.S.
dollars.

Least-squares growth rate 
Least-squares growth rates are used wherever there is a sufﬁ-
ciently long time series to permit a reliable calculation. No
growth rate is calculated if more than half the observations
in a period are missing.

The least-squares growth rate, r, is estimated by ﬁtting a
linear regression trendline to the logarithmic annual values
of the variable in the relevant period. The regression equa-
tion takes the form 

ln Xt = a + bt,

which is equivalent to the logarithmic transformation of the
compound growth equation,

Xt = Xo (1 + r)t.

In this equation, X is the variable, t is time, and a = log Xo
and b = ln (1 + r) are the parameters to be estimated. If b* is
the  least-squares  estimate  of b, the  average  annual  growth
rate, r, is obtained as [exp(b*) – 1] and is multiplied by 100
to express it as a percentage.

The calculated growth rate is an average rate that is repre-
sentative of the available observations over the entire period.
It does not necessarily match the actual growth rate between
any two periods.

Exponential growth rate 
The  growth  rate  between  two  points  in  time  for  certain
demographic  data, notably  labor  force  and  population, is
calculated from the equation 

r = ln (pn /p1)/n,

where  pn and  p1 are  the  last  and  ﬁrst  observations  in  the
period, n is the number of years in the period, and ln is the
natural logarithm operator. This growth rate is based on a
model  of continuous, exponential  growth  between  two
points in time. It does not take into account the intermediate
values  of the  series. Note  also  that  the  exponential  growth
rate does not correspond to the annual rate of change mea-
sured at a one-year interval which is given by

(pn – pn – 1)/pn – 1.

WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2006

World Bank Atlas method 
In calculating GNI and GNI per capita in U.S. dollars for cer-
tain  operational  purposes, the  World  Bank  uses  the  Atlas
conversion factor. The purpose of the Atlas conversion factor
is to reduce the impact of exchange rate ﬂuctuations in the
cross-country  comparison  of national  incomes. The  Atlas
conversion factor for any year is the average of a country’s
exchange rate (or alternative conversion factor) for that year
and its exchange rates for the two preceding years, adjusted
for the difference between the rate of inﬂation in the country
and  that  in  Japan, the  United  Kingdom, the  United  States,
and the Euro Zone. A country’s inﬂation rate is measured by
the change in its GDP deﬂator. The inﬂation rate for Japan,
the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Euro Zone,
representing  international  inﬂation,
is  measured  by  the
change in the SDR deﬂator. (Special drawing rights, or SDRs,
are  the  IMF’s  unit  of account.)  The  SDR  deﬂator  is  calcu-
lated as a weighted average of these countries’ GDP deﬂators
in SDR terms, the weights being the amount of each coun-
try’s  currency  in  one  SDR  unit. Weights  vary  over  time
because  both  the  composition  of the  SDR  and  the  relative
exchange rates for each currency change. The SDR deﬂator is
calculated in SDR terms ﬁrst and then converted to U.S. dol-
lars  using  the  SDR  to  dollar  Atlas  conversion  factor. The
Atlas conversion factor is then applied to a country’s GNI.
The resulting GNI in U.S. dollars is divided by the midyear
population to derive GNI per capita.

When ofﬁcial exchange rates are deemed to be unreliable
or  unrepresentative  of the  effective  exchange  rate  during  a
period, an alternative estimate of the exchange rate is used in
the Atlas formula (see below).

The  following  formulas  describe  the  calculation  of the

Alternative conversion factors
The World Bank systematically assesses the appropriateness
of ofﬁcial exchange rates as conversion factors. An alterna-
tive conversion factor is used when the ofﬁcial exchange rate

is judged to diverge by an exceptionally large margin from
the rate effectively applied to domestic transactions of for-
eign currencies and traded products. This applies to only a
small number of countries, as shown in Primary data docu-
mentation  table  in  World  Development  Indicators  2005.
Alternative conversion factors are used in the Atlas method-
ology  and  elsewhere  in  the  Selected  World  Development
Indicators as single-year conversion factors.

Table 5. Key indicators for other economies
Population is based on the de facto deﬁnition, which counts
all residents, regardless of legal status or citizenship, except
for refugees not permanently settled in the country of asy-
lum, who are generally considered part of the population of
the country of origin.

Average annual population growth rate is the exponen-
tial rate of change for the period (see the section on statisti-
cal methods below).

Population density is midyear population divided by land
area. Land area is a country’s total area excluding areas under
inland bodies of water and coastal waterways. Density is cal-
culated using the most recently available data on land area.

Gross  national  income (GNI—formerly  gross  national
product or GNP), the broadest measure of national income,
measures  total  value  added  from  domestic  and  foreign
sources claimed by residents. GNI comprises gross domestic
product  (GDP)  plus  net  receipts  of primary  income  from
foreign sources. Data are converted from national currency
to current U.S. dollars using the World Bank Atlas method.
This involves using a three-year average of exchange rates to
smooth the effects of transitory exchange rate ﬂuctuations.
(See the section on statistical methods below for further dis-
cussion of the Atlas method.)

GNI per capita is GNI divided by midyear population. It
is converted into current U.S. dollars by the Atlas method.
The World Bank uses GNI per capita in U.S dollars to classify
economies for analytical purposes and to determine borrow-
ing eligibility.

PPP Gross national income, which is GNI converted into
international  dollars  using  purchasing  power  parity  (PPP)
conversion  factors, is  included  because  nominal  exchange
rates do not always reﬂect international differences in relative
prices. At the PPP rate, one international dollar has the same
purchasing power over domestic GNI that the U.S. dollar has
over U.S. GNI. PPP rates allow a standard comparison of real
price  levels  between  countries, just  as  conventional  price
indexes allow comparison of real values over time. The PPP
conversion factors used here are derived from price surveys
covering 118 countries conducted by the International Com-
parison Program. For Organisation for Economic Co-opera-
tion  and  Development  (OECD)  countries  data  come  from
the most recent round of surveys, completed in 1999; the rest
are either from the 1996 survey, or data from the 1993 or ear-

lier  round  and  extrapolated  to  the  1996  benchmark. Esti-
mates for countries not included in the surveys are derived
from statistical models using available data.

PPP GNI per capita is PPP GNI divided by midyear pop-

ulation.

Gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  per  capita  growth is
based on GDP measured in constant prices. Growth in GDP
is considered a broad measure of the growth of an economy.
GDP in constant prices can be estimated by measuring the
total  quantity  of goods  and  services  produced  in  a  period,
valuing them at an agreed set of base year prices, and sub-
tracting  the  cost  of intermediate  inputs, also  in  constant
prices. See  the  section  on  statistical  methods  for  details  of
the least-squares growth rate.

Life expectancy at birth is  the  number  of years  a  new-
born infant would live if patterns of mortality prevailing at
its birth were to stay the same throughout its life.

Adult literacy rate is the percentage of persons aged 15
and  above  who  can, with  understanding, read  and  write  a
short, simple statement about their everyday life.

Carbon  dioxide  (CO2)  emissions  measures  those  emis-
sions  stemming  from  the  burning  of fossil  fuels  and  the
manufacture of cement. These include carbon dioxide pro-
duced during consumption of solid, liquid, and gas fuels and
from gas ﬂaring.

The  Carbon  Dioxide  Information  Analysis  Center
(CDIAC), sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy, cal-
culates annual anthropogenic emissions of CO2. These calcu-
lations  are  derived  from  data  on  fossil  fuel  consumption,
based  on  the  World  Energy  Data  Set  maintained  by  the
UNSD, and  from  data  on  world  cement  manufacturing,
based on the Cement Manufacturing Data Set maintained by
the U.S. Bureau of Mines. Each year the CDIAC recalculates
the entire time series from 1950 to the present, incorporating
its most recent ﬁndings and the latest corrections to its data-
base. Estimates  exclude  fuels  supplied  to  ships  and  aircraft
engaged in international transportation because of the difﬁ-
culty of apportioning these fuels among the countries bene-
ﬁting from that transport.

Inequalities in incomes, in health, and in educational outcomes have long been a stark fact of life

in many developing countries. When such inequalities in outcomes arise from unequal opportu-
nities,  there  are  both  intrinsic  and  instrumental  grounds  for  concern.  Because  inequalities  in
opportunity are often accompanied by profound differences in influence, power, and social status—
whether at the level of individuals or groups—they have a tendency to persist. And because it leads
to an inefficient use of resources and to less effective institutions, inequity is inimical to long-term
development. It follows that there is a legitimate role for public action in the promotion of fairness
and in the pursuit of equity, provided such action is cognizant of the primacy of individual freedoms,
and of the role of markets in allocating resources. 

World Development Report 2006 presents evidence on the inequality of opportunity, within and across
countries, and illustrates the mechanisms through which it impairs development. The Report advocates
taking explicit account of equity in determining development priorities: public action should aim to
expand the opportunities of those who, in the absence of policy interventions, have the least resources,
voice, and capabilities. Domestically, it makes the case for investing in people, expanding access to jus-
tice, land, and infrastructure, and promoting fairness in markets. Internationally, the report considers
the functioning of global markets and the rules that govern them, as well as the complementary pro-
vision of aid to help poor countries and poor people build greater endowments. Drawing on the World
Bank’s 60 years of development experience, the World Development Report 2006 is essential reading
for understanding how greater equity can reduce poverty, enhance economic growth, advance devel-
opment, and deliver increased opportunities to the poorest groups in our societies.
